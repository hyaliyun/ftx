The airport is located on top of a high mesa overlooking a major portion of the city; it is not uncommon for tourists or locals driving around downtown Sedona to see an approaching airplane fly overhead and then suddenly disappear into the mountains without ever appearing to land. The airport is also located very close to the Red Rocks of Sedona.  History  Sedona Airport from the south, showing its location atop a mesa The airport was inaugurated in 1955. At that time it had no paved runway, and animals such as coyotes could be seen walking around the air-strip. This proved dangerous to pilots arriving at Sedona. By 1957, a small, paved runway had been built.http://sedonaairport.org/2016/09/the-history-of-sedona-airport/ By 1990, the airport's runway had been improved and it had begun to receive service from a local scheduled airline. Air Sedona, founded by Jack Seeley in 1981, served Sedona from such places as Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Las Vegas, the nearby Grand Canyon airport and others until 1995.http://www.redrockreview.com/Sep01/7story.html Sedona's airport is not able to accommodate commercial jets of a size of a Boeing 737 or larger. It does, however, attract a large number of smaller business jets and aircraft such as Cessna and Beech airplanes and helicopters. Scenic Airlines discontinued service at Sedona in April 1997.

If Np denotes the number of points on Ep and defined over the field with p elements, the conjecture gives an answer to the distribution of the second-order term for Np. That is, by Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves we have :N_p/p = 1 + \\\\mathrm{O}(1/\\\\\\\\!\\\\sqrt{p})\\\\ as p ‚Üí ‚àû, and the point of the conjecture is to predict how the O-term varies. The original conjecture and its generalization to all totally real fields was proved by Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron, and Richard Taylor under mild assumptions in 2008, and completed by Thomas Barnet-Lamb, David Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor in 2011. Several generalizations to other algebraic varieties and fields are open. Statement Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers without complex multiplication. Define Œ∏p as the solution to the equation : p+1-N_p=2\\\\sqrt{p}\\\\cos\\\\theta_p ~~ (0\\\\leq \\\\theta_p \\\\leq \\\\pi). Then, for every two real numbers \\\\alpha and \\\\beta for which 0\\\\leq \\\\alpha < \\\\beta \\\\leq \\\\pi, :\\\\lim_{N\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{p\\\\leq N:\\\\alpha\\\\leq \\\\theta_p \\\\leq \\\\beta\\\\\\\\}} {\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\{p\\\\leq N\\\\\\\\}}=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\alpha^\\\\beta \\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta. Details By Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves, the ratio :\\\\frac{((p + 1)-N_p)}{2\\\\sqrt{p}}=:\\\\frac{a_p}{2\\\\sqrt{p}} is between -1 and 1. Thus it can be expressed as cos Œ∏ for an angle Œ∏; in geometric terms there are two eigenvalues accounting for the remainder and with the denominator as given they are complex conjugate and of absolute value 1\\\\. The Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture, when E doesn't have complex multiplication,In the case of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, the Hasse‚ÄìWeil L-function is expressed in terms of a Hecke L-function (a result of Max Deuring). The known analytic results on these answer even more precise questions. states that the probability measure of Œ∏ is proportional to :\\\\sin^2 \\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\theta.To normalise, put 2/œÄ in front. This is due to Mikio Sato and John Tate (independently, and around 1960, published somewhat later).It is mentioned in J. Tate, Algebraic cycles and poles of zeta functions in the volume (O. F. G. Schilling, editor), Arithmetical Algebraic Geometry, pages 93‚Äì110 (1965). Proof In 2008, Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, and Taylor published a proof of the Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture for elliptic curves over totally real fields satisfying a certain condition: of having multiplicative reduction at some prime,That is, for some p where E has bad reduction (and at least for elliptic curves over the rational numbers there are some such p), the type in the singular fibre of the N√©ron model is multiplicative, rather than additive. In practice this is the typical case, so the condition can be thought of as mild. In more classical terms, the result applies where the j-invariant is not integral. in a series of three joint papers. Further results are conditional on improved forms of the Arthur‚ÄìSelberg trace formula. Harris has a conditional proof of a result for the product of two elliptic curves (not isogenous) following from such a hypothetical trace formula.See Carayol's Bourbaki seminar of 17 June 2007 for details. In 2011, Barnet-Lamb, Geraghty, Harris, and Taylor proved a generalized version of the Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture for an arbitrary non-CM holomorphic modular form of weight greater than or equal to two, by improving the potential modularity results of previous papers.Theorem B of The prior issues involved with the trace formula were solved by Michael Harris, and Sug Woo Shin.See p. 71 and Corollary 8.9 of In 2015, Richard Taylor was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics \\"for numerous breakthrough results in (...) the Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture.\\" Generalisations There are generalisations, involving the distribution of Frobenius elements in Galois groups involved in the Galois representations on √©tale cohomology. In particular there is a conjectural theory for curves of genus n > 1\\\\. Under the random matrix model developed by Nick Katz and Peter Sarnak, there is a conjectural correspondence between (unitarized) characteristic polynomials of Frobenius elements and conjugacy classes in the compact Lie group USp(2n) = Sp(n). The Haar measure on USp(2n) then gives the conjectured distribution, and the classical case is USp(2) = SU(2). Refinements There are also more refined statements. The Lang‚ÄìTrotter conjecture (1976) of Serge Lang and Hale Trotter states the asymptotic number of primes p with a given value of ap, the trace of Frobenius that appears in the formula. For the typical case (no complex multiplication, trace ‚â† 0) their formula states that the number of p up to X is asymptotically :c \\\\sqrt{X}/ \\\\log X\\\\ with a specified constant c. Neal Koblitz (1988) provided detailed conjectures for the case of a prime number q of points on Ep, motivated by elliptic curve cryptography.. In 1999, Chantal David and Francesco Pappalardi proved an averaged version of the Lang‚ÄìTrotter conjecture.

The A-level examination is typically taken by students at the end of their second or third year in junior college. Overview The programme allows for more time allocated to enrichment activities. That is, without the O-level examinations, the students have more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broad-based education which will eventually lead to the A-level examination. In addition, the students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects. Generally, only the top performers are eligible to be part of the IP programme, do use to implement it, as it is currently regarded as experimental. Thus most of the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at the current pace by first completing a four-year O-level course before proceeding to a two-year A-level education.  A-level programmes  The integrated programme was first implemented in Dunman High School, Hwa Chong Institution (formerly The Chinese High School), Nanyang Girls' High School, Raffles Girls School, Raffles Institution, and River Valley High School in 2004. The IP allows students to skip the O-level at secondary four and be admitted directly to junior colleges (while there are cases of students being asked by the school to \\"leave\\" this system as their pace could not be kept up). However, the students would still have to take the Mother Tongue O-level. All the schools allowed in the scheme accepts the top 10% of the national cohort. This ensures that students who are under the IP are able to cope with their A-level after bypassing their O-level. Some junior colleges including National Junior College, Temasek Junior College, and Victoria Junior College, offer it independently. VJC is now offering it with Cedar Girls Secondary and Victoria School (more info below) For the four-year IP, secondary two students from various schools are allowed to apply for this programme. These students have their secondary three and four education in the junior college itself, followed by the A-level course. Dunman High School (DHS) applied for the IP system in mid-2004 standalone, and the Ministry of Education approved the first batch to be enrolled in 2005, with Year 1 and Year 3 students, each having a cap of about 135 out of 380 students. Full IP was granted in late 2005, and the school went full IP at the beginning of 2006. River Valley High School joined the IP system in 2006 by operating a six-year course standalone. Since 2009, National Junior College has also accepted students who have taken the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), making it a six-year program. Since 2012, Victoria School and Cedar Girls' Secondary School are offering the IP with Victoria Junior College which will build upon the four-year Victoria Integrated Programme (VIP) in the junior college. It is [called the VCA IP( Victoria Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme). In January 2013, the Joint Integrated Programme, commonly referred to as the JIP, offered by Catholic High School, CHIJ Saint Nicholas Girls' School and Singapore Chinese Girls' School, alongside with Eunoia Junior College, was established. The four schools are the newest additions to the Integrated Programme landscape. The three secondary schools will continue to offer the 'O' Level track alongside the IP track, thus they are termed by the MOE as dual track schools. Such schools allow students to have the flexibility to switch to the stream that is better suited to the students' needs.  International Baccalaureate program  Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Methodist Girls' School, and St. Joseph's Institution, the only IP leading to IB schools in the country, have allowed their students to abandon the British system and \\"go Swiss\\" by dropping the GCE examinations altogether and adopting the International Baccalaureate (IB), having been fully authorized as IB World Schools. The IB is generally regarded as a better track if the students have plans to study overseas in future. The IB allows students to take both arts and science subjects, philosophy courses and extensive research papers. Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) is regarded as one of the top schools in terms of results of the IB in the world, having averages as high as 42 out of a total of 45 points. St. Joseph's Institution started its IP in 2013.  NUS High School Diploma  The NUS High School of Mathematics and Science is the only IP school in Singapore which specialises in mathematics and science and leads to the NUS High School Diploma. It aims to develop all-rounded students through its 6 year diploma curriculum, which allows rigour and depth, or flexibility and breadth. NUS High School is also affiliated and very closely linked to the National University of Singapore (NUS). Students in this school graduate with the NUS High School diploma, which has been accredited by all universities in Singapore as well as top universities worldwide . For placement into overseas universities, they may also take the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and Advanced Placement (AP).

However, this may be considered a utopian ideal. Without an important watershed intervening national examination to help them focus, students may simply let their guard down. IP may also widen inequality among students in Singapore. Most of the places in top Junior Colleges are reserved for IP students. This includes Victoria Junior College, Raffles Institution, NUS High School of Math and Science and Hwa Chong Institution. As such, students taking the O Level track will face tighter competition when they wish to enter top schools in Singapore, in comparison to their IP peers. The Integrated Programme is allegedly for clearly university-bound students. While for non-IP students who fail to perform well in the A-level, they still have their O-level qualifications, which act as a \\"safety net\\". However, in the absence of this \\"safety net\\", IP students who under-perform in the A-level will have only their Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) certificate to fall back on.

Levitation is accomplished by providing an upward force that counteracts the pull of gravity (in relation to gravity on earth), plus a smaller stabilizing force that pushes the object toward a home position whenever it is a small distance away from that home position. The force can be a fundamental force such as magnetic or electrostatic, or it can be a reactive force such as optical, buoyant, aerodynamic, or hydrodynamic. Levitation excludes floating at the surface of a liquid because the liquid provides direct mechanical support. Levitation excludes hovering flight by insects, hummingbirds, helicopters, rockets, and balloons because the object provides its own counter-gravity force. Physics Levitation (on Earth or any planetoid) requires an upward force that cancels out the weight of the object, so that the object does not fall (accelerate downward) or rise (accelerate upward). For positional stability, any small displacement of the levitating object must result in a small change in force in the opposite direction. the small changes in force can be accomplished by gradient field(s) or by active regulation. If the object is disturbed, it might oscillate around its final position, but its motion eventually decreases to zero due to damping effects. (In a turbulent flow, the object might oscillate indefinitely.) Levitation techniques are useful tools in physics research. For example, levitation methods are useful for high- temperature melt property studies because they eliminate the problem of reaction with containers and allow deep undercooling of melts. The containerless conditions may be obtained by opposing gravity with a levitation force instead of allowing an entire experiment to freefall. Magnetic levitation a high-temperature superconductor levitating above magnet Magnetic levitation is the most commonly seen and used form of levitation. Diamagnetic materials are commonly used for demonstration purposes. In this case the returning force appears from the interaction with the screening currents. For example, a superconducting sample, which can be considered either as a perfect diamagnet or an ideally hard superconductor, easily levitates in an ambient external magnetic field. The superconductor is first heated strongly, then cooled with liquid nitrogen to levitate on top of a diamagnet. In a very strong magnetic field by means of diamagnetic levitation, even small live animals have been levitated. It is possible to levitate pyrolytic graphite by placing thin squares of it above four cube magnets with the north poles forming one diagonal and south poles forming the other diagonal. Researcher have even successfully levitated (non-magnetic) liquid droplets surrounded by paramagnetic fluids. The process of such inverse magnetic levitation is usually referred to as Magneto-Archimedes effect. A magnetically levitated (maglev) train departing Shanghai Pudong International Airport on the first commercial high-speed maglev line in the world. Magnetic levitation is in development for use for transportation systems. For example, the Maglev includes trains that are levitated by a large number of magnets. Due to the lack of friction on the guide rails, they are faster, quieter, and smoother than wheeled mass transit systems. Electrodynamic suspension uses AC magnetic fields. Electrostatic levitation In electrostatic levitation an electric field is used to counteract gravitational force. Some spiders shoot silk into the air to ride Earth's electric field. Aerodynamic levitation In aerodynamic levitation, the levitation is achieved by floating the object on a stream of gas, either produced by the object or acting on the object. For example, a ping pong ball can be levitated with the stream of air from a vacuum cleaner set on \\"blow\\". With enough thrust, very large objects can be levitated using this method. =Gas film levitation= This technique enables the levitation of an object against gravitational force by floating it on a thin gas film formed by gas flow through a porous membrane. Using this technique, high temperature melts can be kept clean from contamination and be supercooled. A common example in general usage includes air hockey, where the puck is lifted by a thin layer of air. Hovercraft also use this technique, producing a large region of high-pressure air underneath them. Acoustic levitation Acoustic levitation uses sound waves to provide a levitating force. Optical levitation Optical levitation is a technique in which a material is levitated against the downward force of gravity by an upward force stemming from photon momentum transfer (radiation pressure). Buoyant levitation Gases at high pressure can have a density exceeding that of some solids. Thus they can be used to levitate solid objects through buoyancy.http://www.mrs.org/s_mrs/sec_subscribe.asp?CID=12048&DID;=275340&action;=detail Materials Processing Through Levitation in High Gas Pressure Noble gases are preferred for their non-reactivity. Xenon is the densest non-radioactive noble gas, at 5.894g/L. Xenon has been used to levitate polyethylene, at a pressure of 154atm. Casimir force Scientists have discovered a way of levitating ultra small objects by manipulating the so-called Casimir force, which normally causes objects to stick together due to forces predicted by quantum field theory. This is, however, only possible for micro-objects. Uses =Maglev trains= Magnetic levitation is used to suspend trains without touching the track. This permits very high speeds, and greatly reduces the maintenance requirements for tracks and vehicles, as little wear occurs. This also means there is no friction, so the only force acting against it is air resistance. =Animal levitation= Diamagnetic levitation of a live frog. Scientists have levitated frogs, grasshoppers, and mice by means of powerful electromagnets utilizing superconductors, producing diamagnetic repulsion of body water. The mice acted confused at first, but adapted to the levitation after approximately four hours, suffering no immediate ill effects. Mice Levitated in Lab Further reading *.

In general, traffic psychology aims to apply theoretical aspects of psychology in order to improve traffic mobility by helping to develop and apply crash countermeasures, as well as by guiding desired behaviors through education and the motivation of road users. Behavior is frequently studied in conjunction with crash research in order to assess causes and differences in crash involvement. Traffic psychologists distinguish three motivations of driver behavior: reasoned or planned behavior, impulsive or emotional behavior, and habitual behavior. Additionally, social and cognitive applications of psychology are used, such as enforcement, road safety education campaigns, and also therapeutic and rehabilitation programs. Broad theories of cognition, doi: 10.1016/0042-6989(93)90252-R sensory-motor and neurological aspects psychology are also applied to the field of traffic psychology. Studies of factors such as attention, memory, spatial cognition, inexperience, stress, inebriation, distracting/ambiguous stimuli, fatigue, and secondary tasks such as phone conversations are used to understand and investigate the experience and actions of road users.Groeger, J.

(2001). Traffic psychology today. Boston, London: Kluwer Academic Publishers. The transportation system consists of road, rail, sea and air infrastructures. It includes the possibilities and limitations of its economics, laws and regulations, which sets barriers to the capabilities of an individual and mass motorist. For instance, speed can be influenced by method of travel (vehicle, airplane, train or ship), by financial capabilities for the type of vehicle (jet versus commercial, speed boat against sail boat and sedan compared to a luxury sports car), or by regulations such as speed limits in rural areas versus city driving. The traffic environment takes into account location, time constraints, population and dangers that are exposed to motorist. These environmental factors pose danger and risk to motorists that may be fatal. Driving in wet, narrow, and dark conditions exposes drivers to far greater risk than driving on a sunny day on an open road. This is just one type of road factor for crashes that Sullman goes on to explain in further detail: ::‚Ä¶crashes include lack of visibility or obstructions, unclean road or loose material, poor road conditions or road markings, and the horizontal curvature of the road. Environmental influences such as cold or hot weather, noise and vibration are all more likely to impact on stress and fatigue states Sullman, M., & Dorn, L. (2012). Advances in traffic psychology: Human factors in Road and rail transport. Variability of the driver's age, personality, temperament, stress and expertise affect speed, control and decisions. Drivers generally use some degree of risk compensation to assess driving decisions and it is skewed by varying levels of intoxication. Alcohol and drug usage, alertness and fatigue, distraction and focus are a few of the main factors attributed to driver error and crashes.Cacciabue, P. C. (2007). Modeling driver behaviour in automotive environments: Critical issues in driver interactions with intelligent transport systems. Crash research In addition to behavior research, crash research is also a component in traffic psychology, looking at driving methodology, individual differences, characteristics of personality, temporary impairments, and relevant capabilities, the driver as an information processor (includes perception and reaction times), human factors on highway crashs, and the pedestrian (identifying vulnerability, causes and prevention of crashs).Shinar, D. (1978). Psychology on the road: The human factor in traffic safety. (1st ed.). Berkshire, United Kingdom: Transport Research Laboratory. =Human factors= Examination of the operator plays a large role in transportation psychology. While many external factors influence traffic safety, internal factors are also significant. Some factors include: * Decision-making * Demographics * Distraction * Detection Thresholds * Drugs and alcohol * Driving training and experience * Familiarity with vehicle and environment * Fatigue * Inattention * Perception-reaction time * Response to the unexpected * Risky behaviors * Stress and panic  Psychological research  = Neuropsychology= Linking brain regions, networks, and circuits with behaviors involved in operating a vehicle is one of the more salient topics of research within traffic psychology. Seven separate brain networks have been identified in driving simulations as being of importance to the neurophysiological processes involved in driving. The networks each have a unique function as outlined by Porter: The parietoccipital sulcus is involved in visual monitoring, motor cortex and cerebellar areas‚Äîfor gross motor control and motor planning; orbitofrontal and cingulate ‚Äî for error monitoring and inhibition, including motivation, risk assessment, and internal space; and medial frontal, parietal, and posterior cingulate for vigilance, including spatial attention, visual stream, monitoring, and external space.Porter, B. E. (Ed.). (2011). Handbook of traffic psychology. Academic Press. By linking neuropsychological processes and driving, the ability to understand errors, development, and safety is enhanced. The involvement of motor and cerebellar networks in driving was confirmed by Calhoun, Pekar, and Pearlson (2004). Research into in alcohol dosage and its related effect on neuropsychological processes found that greater quantities of alcohol created a larger likelihood to engage in high speed driving and an increase in the number of times the speed limit was exceeded.Translating cognitive neuroscience to the driver's operational environment: A neuroergonomic approach.

Psychological assessment, counseling, and rehabilitation Rehabilitation counseling is a process because of the many steps involved for an individual to become self-reliant. A driver rehabilitation specialist (DRS) is one who ‚Äúplans, develops, coordinates and implements driving service for individuals with disabilities‚Äù Association of Driver Rehabilitation Specialists: Driver Rehabilitation Specialist Certification Exam fact sheet (www.driver- ed.org/public/articles/index.cfm?Cat=10) DSR's may come from backgrounds such as physical therapy, psychology, and driver education. Evaluating a driver requires many aspects. A clinical assessment includes a review of the medical history, driving history, and driving needs. Visual and perceptual assessment along range of motion, motor strength, coordination, sensation, reaction time and cognitive assessment is a crucial aspect and the focus of the medical history evaluation. ‚ÄúAn initial driver evaluation can last one to four hours, depending on the client‚Äôs presenting disabilities and driving needs. Following the clinical assessment, clients undergo an on-road assessment if they meet the minimum state standards for health and vision, and the client holds a valid driver‚Äôs license or permit. The on-road assessment is performed in a driver rehabilitation vehicle equipped with dual brakes, rear-view mirror and eye-check mirror for the DRS, and any necessary adaptive equipment‚Äù Assessing and Counseling Older Drivers http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/olddrive/olderdriversbook/pages/Chapter5.html#Anchor-4%20T-22329 The goal in the rehabilitation process is to have the individual realize their condition and attempt to reinstate them into a driving environment in which they will pose no threat to others. Approach Transportation psychology has emerged rapidly since the 1980s and, from its inception, has followed an interdisciplinary approach and has shared common topics with other fields, in particular medicine (e.g. driving aptitude), engineering (e.g. ergonomics and human factors), and economics (e.g. travel demand management). Mobility, including its positive and negative repercussions, originates in people's decisions and behavior ‚Äì and these could be influenced. The main causes of traffic crashs are errors due to maladaptive behavior in interaction with roadways or other vehicles.

The castle was originally built as a country summerhouse in 1606 and is an example of Christian IV's many architectural projects. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style, typical of Danish buildings during this period, and has been expanded several times, finally evolving into its present condition by the year 1624. Architects Bertel Lange and Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger are associated with the structural planning of the castle. History Rosenborg Castle seen from Gothersgade in 1749 The castle was used by Danish regents as a royal residence until around 1710. After the reign of Frederik IV, Rosenborg was used as a royal residence only twice, and both these times were during emergencies. The first time was after Christiansborg Palace burned down in 1794, and the second time was during the British attack on Copenhagen in 1801. Architecture =Long Hall= The Coat of arms of Denmark is located on the ceiling of the Long Hall Located on the third floor, the Long Hall was completed in 1624. It was originally intended as a ballroom. Around 1700 it was used as Royal Reception Room and for banquets. It was not until the second half of the 19th century that it became known as the \\"Knight's Hall\\". Christian V had the hall partly modernised with twelve tapestries depicting the King's victories in the Scanian War (1675‚Äì1679). The stucco ceiling seen today is from the beginning of the 18th century. It shows the Danish Coat of Arms surrounded by the Orders of the Elephant and of Dannebrog. Side reliefs depict historical events from the first years of the reign of Frederik IV, including the liberation of the serfs, the founding of the dragoons and of the land militia among them. The frescos in the ceiling by Hendrick Krock, represent the Regalia. Among the main attractions of Rosenborg are the coronation chair of the absolutist kings and the throne of the queens with the three silver lions standing in front. The Long Hall also contains a large collection of silver furniture, of which most is from the 17th century. Rosenborg Collections The castle is open to the public for tours and houses a museum exhibiting the Royal Collections, artifacts spanning a breadth of royal Danish culture, from the late 16th century of Christian IV to the 19th century. Some of these articles once belonged to the nobility and the aristocracy. The castle, now state property, was opened to the public in 1838. Of special interest to tourists is a treasury displaying the Crown Jewels and the Danish Crown Regalia located in the castle. A Coronation Carpet is also stored there. The Throne Chair of Denmark is located in the castle. In the summer time, flowers bloom in front of the castle in the castle garden. Gardens The castle is situated in Kongens Have (\\"The King's Garden\\"), also known as \\"Rosenborg Castle Garden\\". The Rosenborg Castle Garden is the country's oldest royal garden and was embellished in the Renaissance style by Christian IV shortly before the construction of the main castle. Today, the gardens are a popular retreat for the people of Copenhagen, and attract an estimated 2.5 million visitors every year. Next to the castle are barracks where the Royal Life Guards is garrisoned. The Life Guard guards the castle.

She was the first leader of the Internet Party, and stood for Parliament in the 2014 general election through the Helensville electorate. From 1996 to 2002, she was a Member of Parliament for the Alliance party, briefly leading that party after the group experienced a schism in 2002. Early life Harr√©'s father was a social anthropologist, and the family spent a part of her childhood (including some years of primary school) living in Fiji while he studied urbanisation there. Her mother was an actress. After returning to New Zealand, she attended secondary school in Auckland at Auckland Girls' Grammar, before gaining Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees at the University of Auckland. At university she won the senior prizes for political studies and law and became an anti-nuclear activist. Professional life After finishing her degree she spent 10 weeks on the Nicaraguan-Honduran border with the \\"Harry Holland Coffee Picking Brigade\\" before spending a year working at the United Nations on disarmament issues and as a representative of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She then worked for some time as a lawyer specialising in industrial relations and employment law, and developing close links to the trade-union movement. =1982-1996 - Labour, NewLabour, and the Alliance= Harr√© joined the Labour Party in 1982, representing the youth wing on the party's New Zealand Council. She worked in the Beehive as an advisor to disarmament minister Fran Wilde. Throughout her seven-year membership of the party she was a critic of the policies advanced by Roger Douglas, who became Minister of Finance when Labour won the 1984 election. Douglas, an advocate of free-market economics, introduced a programme of radical reforms (Rogernomics) which alienated many of Labour's traditional supporters, including Harr√©. In 1989, Harr√© resigned from the Labour Party. She became a founding member of the NewLabour Party, an organisation started by dissident Labour MP Jim Anderton. NewLabour later joined with several other parties to form the Alliance. She stood for the Alliance nomination to contest the Tamaki by-election in 1992, but was unsuccessful. Harr√© then stood as the Alliance candidate for the Te Atat≈´ electorate in the 1993 election, but was unsuccessful, coming runner-up to Labour's Chris Carter. =1996-2002 - Member of Parliament= In the 1996 election, which took place under the new MMP electoral system, the Alliance ranked Harr√© in eighth place on its party list. The Alliance gained a sufficient number of votes for Harr√© to enter parliament. After the 1999 election, the Alliance formed a coalition government with Labour (which had by then backed away from many of the policies introduced by Douglas). Harr√© became Minister for Women and Minister of Youth Affairs and Associate Minister of Labour and Commerce. She later gained additional responsibilities as Minister of Statistics. She led the parliamentary campaign for the introduction of paid parental leave from Opposition and as a Minister sponsored the legislation to introduce 12 weeks paid parental leave in 2002. Other causes championed by Harr√© included legislation protecting the interests of building industry sub-contractors, significant minimum-wage increases and the reduction of age discrimination in the minimum wage. She re-launched the pay-equity debate as Minister of Women's Affairs, and a campaign to increase annual leave from three weeks to four weeks. In late 2001, however, the Alliance began to show signs of internal strain. In particular, some members of the party felt that it was losing its independent political identity and failing to differentiate itself from the Labour Party on issues such as free trade, tertiary-education funding and other core areas. The decision of Jim Anderton and a majority of Alliance MPs to back New Zealand's involvement in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan brought these tensions to a head, dividing the caucus and separating the parliamentary leadership from the majority in the non-parliamentary party organisation (led by Matt McCarten). Harr√©, however, aligned herself with the grass-roots party view, and became its de facto leader in parliament. The collapse of the Alliance soon became inevitable, with Anderton and his supporters deciding to contest the 2002 election as a new party (the Progressives). Harr√©, considered to be the foremost of the MPs who remained behind, was chosen to lead what remained of the Alliance into its election campaign, aiming to at least retain a presence in parliament. Harr√© herself was seen as the party's best chance of keeping a parliamentary seat, having a relatively strong chance of winning the seat of Waitakere. In the election itself, however, Harr√© placed second, being defeated by Labour's Lynne Pillay. The following year, Harr√© stepped down as leader of the Alliance, being replaced by Matt McCarten. Harr√© was still active in the Alliance afterwards and was elected to the party executive at its annual conference in 2003. At the 2004 party conference she chose not to re-contest a position within the Alliance stating that from then on the most pragmatic approach for the Alliance would be to instead support the Greens and Maori Party. She was not aligned to any other political party from 2004‚Äì2011, but in 2012 accepted a role as issues director of the Green Party. =2002-2014 - Intermission from parliamentary politics= Harr√© speaking outside parliament buildings in 2006 From 2002 to 2005, Harr√© led the industrial work of the New Zealand Nurses Organisation, including its successful pay-equity campaign for public-sector nurses. She served as General Secretary of the National Distribution Union from 2005 to 2009, after which she joined the Auckland Transition Agency. Harr√© speaking at the New Zealand Council of Trade Union's biennial women's conference in 2009 Between 2010 and 2012 Harr√© worked for the International Labour Organization in Fiji. Subsequently, in 2012 she started work as the inaugural issues director of the Green Party, a position she resigned from in 2013. Harr√© quit the Green Party in protest to the way that the Greens had handled a rebuffed proposition by the Labour Party for conducting a joint electoral campaign. Harr√© co-owns an Auckland restaurant, Ika, which pays a living wage to its staff. =2014 - Return to parliamentary politics= On 29 May 2014, Harr√© was named as the first leader of New Zealand's Internet Party. The party allied with the Mana Party to contest the 2014 election as the Internet MANA Party. Harr√© had second place on the combined party's list. Vikram Kumar (secretary of the Internet Party) initially approached her about becoming a candidate; she declined, but later reconsidered after a meeting with Kim Dotcom. She stated at the time that she got involved again in politics because she wanted to encourage young people to vote, and to re-connect disenfranchised people with the political system. Following the failure of Internet MANA to enter Parliament, Harr√© stood back from media view for several weeks before formally announcing she was stepping down as leader of the Internet Party, effective December 2014. Since the election, Harr√© has been occasionally writing on New Zealand left-wing blog site The Daily Blog, and undertook a \\"pilgrimage\\" across New Zealand called Rethinking the System. In December 2016, Harr√© announced she had rejoined the Labour Party 27 years after she left to join NewLabour. Personal life Harr√© lives in Te Atat≈´ and is married to Barry Gribben. They met through the Labour Party and share an interest in an organic vineyard, a restaurant, and several properties. She also has two children. Harr√© was diagnosed with breast cancer, and, because she has a family history of the disease, opted for a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction. She made a full recovery. Harr√© has run several marathons, including the 2013 Boston Marathon, where she was only a few hundred metres away from the terrorist bombing that occurred near the finish line. Harr√© is the niece of late philosopher and psychologist Rom Harr√© and the sister of psychologist and environmentalist Prof Niki Harr√©.

In inscriptions, also, both towns are called . This indiscriminate use sometimes produces ambiguity, especially in the Latin prose authors. The current city of Paphos lies on the Mediterranean coast, about west of Limassol (the biggest port on the island), both of which are connected by the A6 highway. Paphos International Airport is the country's second-largest airport. The city has a subtropical-Mediterranean climate, with the mildest temperatures on the island. Paphos is included in the official UNESCO list of cultural and natural treasures of the world's heritage for its ancient ruins and was selected as a European Capital of Culture for 2017 along with Aarhus. Foundation myth In the founding myth, the town's name is linked to the goddess Aphrodite, as the eponymous Paphos was the son (or, in Ovid, daughter) of PygmalionPygmalion's father was Belus, simply \\"lord\\". whose ivory cult image of Aphrodite was brought to life by the goddess as \\"milk- white\\" Galatea. The author of Bibliotheke gives the genealogy.Bibliotheke, iii.14.3. Pygmalion was so devoted to the cult of Aphrodite that he took the statue to his palace and kept it on his couch. The daimon of the goddess entered into the statue, and the living Galatea bore Pygmalion a son, Paphos, and a daughter, Metharme. Cinyras, debated as to if he is the son of PaphosAccording to the Roman Hyginus, Fabula 142, Cinyras was a son of Paphus, thus legitimate in the patrilineal manner, but Bibliotheke makes Cinyras an interloper, arriving with some of his people from Cilicia on the nearest coast of Asia Minor, and thus a suitor from outside, in the matrilineal manner. The conflict is instructive. or Metharme's suitor, founded the city under Aphrodite's patronage and built the great temple to the goddess there. According to another legend preserved by Strabo (xi. p. 505), it was founded by the Amazons. Old Paphos Old Paphos (Palaepaphos), now known as Kouklia (; or ; ) (Engel, Kypros, vol. i. p. 125), is on a hillThe hill is celsa Paphos in Aeneid x. 51 that had a road which spanned a few miles to the sea. It was not far from the Zephyrium promontory (Strabo xiv. p. 683) and the mouth of the Bocarus stream.Hesychius, under Archaeology shows that Old Paphos has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. It was a centre for Aphrodite's cult. Aphrodite's mythical birthplace was on the island. The founding myth is interwoven with the goddess such that Old Paphos became the most famous and important place for worshipping Aphrodite in the ancient world. The Greek names of two ancient kings, Etevandros and Akestor, are attested in Cypriot syllabary on objects of seventh century BC found in Kourion. = Aphrodite and Paphos = The Greeks agreed that Aphrodite had landed at the site of Paphos when she rose from the sea.Tac. Hist. ii. 3; Mela, ii. 7; Lucan viii.456 According to Pausanias (i. 14), although her worship was introduced to Paphos from Syria, it was much more likely that it was of Phoenician origin. Before being proven by archaeology it was thought that Aphrodite's cult had been established before the time of Homer (c. 700 BC), as the grove and altar of Aphrodite at Paphos are mentioned in the Odyssey (viii. 362). Archaeology established that Cypriots venerated a fertility goddess in a cult that combined Aegean and eastern mainland aspects before the arrival of the Greeks. Female figurines and charms found in the immediate vicinity date back to the early third millennium. The temenos was well established before the first structures were erected in the Late Bronze Age: Old Paphos was the centre of worshipping Aphrodite for the whole Aegean world. The Cinyradae, or descendants of Cinyras, were the chief priests; Greek by name but of Phoenician origin. Their power and authority were great, but it may be inferred from certain inscriptions that they were controlled by a senate and an assembly of the people. There was also an oracle here.Engel, i.p. 483. Few cities have ever been so much sung and glorified by the poets.For example, Aeschylus Suppliants 525; Virgil Aeneid i. 415; Horace Odes i. 19, 30, iii. 26; Status Silvius i. 2. 101; Aristophanes Lysistrata 833, etc. The ruins of Aphrodite's vast sanctuary are still discernible, its circumference marked by huge foundation walls. After its destruction by an earthquake it was rebuilt by Vespasian, on whose coins it is represented, as well as on earlier and later ones, and in the style on those of Septimius Severus.Engel, vol. i. p. 130. From these representations and the existing ruins, Gustav Friedrich Hetsch, an architect of Copenhagen, has attempted to restore the building.M√ºller's Arch√§ol. ¬ß 239, p. 261; Eckhel, vol. iii. p. 86. =New Paphos= Mosaic from the House of Dionysos, god of wine, 3rd c. AD New Paphos (Nea Paphos) was founded on the sea near a natural harbour. It lay about 60 stadia or 12 km northwest of the old city.Strabo xiv. p. 683. It also had a founding myth: it was said to have been founded by Agapenor, chief of the Arcadians at the siege of Troy,Iliad. ii.609 who, after the capture of the city, was driven out by the storm that separated the Greek fleet onto the coast of Cyprus. (Pausanias viii. 5. ¬ß 2.) An Agapenor was mentioned as king of the Paphians in a Greek distich preserved in the Analecta;p. 181, Brunk and Herodotus (vii. 90) alludes to an Arcadian \\"colony\\" in Cyprus. In reality, it was probably founded by Nicocles, the last king of Palaepaphos, based on an inscription recording his founding of the temple of Artemis Agrotera at Nea Paphos. The inhabitants of Marion were probably also transferred to this new city after its destruction in 312 BC by Ptolemy. A hoard of unused silver coins (in the Cyprus museum) found under the Hellenistic House dating back to the end of the 4th century BC are the earliest find at the site and indicates its founding date. Old Paphos always retained the pre-eminence in worship of Aphrodite, and Strabo states that the road leading to it from New Paphos was annually crowded with male and female votaries travelling to the ancient shrine, and coming not only from the New Paphos, but also from other towns of Cyprus. When Seneca said (N. Q. vi. 26, Epistle 91) that Paphos was nearly destroyed by an earthquake, it is difficult to say to which of the towns he refers. Dio Cassius (liv. 23) relates that it was restored by Augustus, and called \\"Augusta\\" in his honor; but though this name has been preserved in inscriptions, it never supplanted the ancient one in popular use. St Paul's Pillar in Paphos According to the biblical Acts of the Apostles, after landing at Salamis and proclaiming the Word of God in the synagogues,Acts 13:5 the prophets and teachers, Barnabas and Saul of Tarsus, traveled along the entire southern coast of the island of Cyprus until they reached Paphos.Acts 13:4-6 There, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted after Saul rebuked the Sorcerer Elymas.Acts 13:6‚Äì12 In Paphos, Acts first identifies Saul as Paul.Acts 13:9 Tacitus (Hist. ii. 2, 3) records a visit of the youthful Titus to Paphos before he acceded to the empire, who inquired with much curiosity into its history and antiquities. (Cf. Suetonius Titus c. 5.) Under this name the historian included the ancient as well as the more modern city: and among other traits of the worship of the temple he records that the only image of the goddess was a pyramidal stone. The sanctuary was closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire. =Archaeology= Paphos Archaeological Park covers most of the ancient Greek and Roman City and is a UNESCO World Heritage site for its ancient ruins. The most significant remains so far discovered are four large and elaborate Roman villas: the House of Dionysos, the House of Orpheus, the House of Aion and the House of Theseus, all with preserved mosaic floors. In addition, excavations have uncovered an Agora, Asklepion, the Basilica of Panagia Limeniotissa, an Odeon cinema, a theatre, and a necropolis known as the Tombs of the Kings. =Post-Classical history= Paphos gradually lost much of its attraction as an administrative centre, particularly after the founding of Nicosia. The city and its port continued to decline throughout the Middle Ages and Ottoman rule, as Nicosia, and the port city of Larnaca became more important. The city and district continued to lose population throughout the British colonial period and many of its inhabitants moved to Limassol, Nicosia and overseas. The city and district of Paphos remained the most underdeveloped part of the island until 1974. =Modern Paphos= Following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, there was rapid economic activity in all fields, especially tourism in the Kato Paphos area. The government invested heavily in irrigation dams and water distribution works, road infrastructure and the building of Paphos International Airport, the second international airport in Cyprus. In the 1980s, Kato Paphos received most of the investment. In the 1990s, Coral Bay Resort was further developed and in the 2000s, the Aphrodite Hills resort was developed. Today Paphos, with a population of about 35,961 (), is a popular tourist resort and is home to a fishing harbour. Ktima is the main residential district while Kato Paphos, by the sea, is built around the medieval port and contains most of the luxury hotels and the entertainment infrastructure of the city. Apostolou Pavlou Avenue (St. Paul's Avenue), the busiest road in Paphos, connects two quarters of the city. It begins near the city centre at Kennedy Square and ends outside the medieval fort at the harbour. Economy The economy of Paphos heavily depends on tourism and there are four resorts in the district: Kato Paphos, Coral Bay, Latchi, and Aphrodite Hills. The largest is Kato Paphos which employs over half of Paphos' population. Farming, especially banana, grape and tobacco cultivation, contributes significantly to Paphos' economy. Landmarks Paphos pedestrian boulevard The Saracen Rock (foreground) and the Rock of the Greek (background) Paphos Lighthouse Agios Neophytos Monastery M/V EDRO III resting off the rocks near the Sea Caves northwest of Paphos Paphos Castle stands by the harbor, and was originally a Byzantine fort built to protect the harbour. It was rebuilt by the Lusignans in the 13th century before being dismantled in 1570 by the Venetians, who were unable to defend it against the Ottomans who restored and strengthened it after capturing the island. Saranta Kolones, Kato Paphos, near the harbor, is a castle built in the first years of Lusignan rule (beginning of the 12th century) maybe on the site of a previous Byzantine castle. It was destroyed in the earthquake of 1222. UNESCO added the entire town to its World Cultural Heritage List. Among the treasures unearthed are the mosaics in the Houses of Dionysos, Theseus and Aion, preserved after 16 centuries underground; vaults and caves; the Tombs of the Kings; and the pillar to which Saint Paul was said to have been tied and whipped and the ancient Odeon Theatre. Other places of interest include the Byzantine Museum and the District Archaeological Museum, with its collection of Cypriot antiquities from the Paphos area dating back from the Neolithic Age up to 1700 AD. Near the Odeon are the ruins of the ancient city walls, the Roman Agora, and a building dedicated to Asclepius, god of medicine. The mosaic floors of these elite villas dating from the 3rd to the 5th century are among the finest in the Eastern Mediterranean. They mainly depict scenes from Greek mythology. The city contains many catacomb sites dating back to the early Christian period. The most famous is Saint Solomoni Church, originally a Christian catacomb retaining some of its 12th century frescoes. A sacred tree at the entrance is believed to cure the ailments of those who hang a personal offering on its branches. A few miles outside the city, the rock of Aphrodite (lit. \\"Stone of the Greek\\") emerges from the sea. According to legend, Aphrodite rose from the waves at this spot. The Greek name, Petra tou Romiou is associated with the legendary frontier- guard of Byzantine times, Digenis Acritas, who kept the marauding Saracens at bay. It is said that to repel one attack he heaved a large rock at his enemy. The site recently had the Aphrodite Hills resort built on it. The resort features a five-star intercontinental resort hotel, an 18-hole golf course, tennis courts, fitness facilities, holiday villas, apartments, townhouses and the Retreat Spa. Near Petra tou Romiou is Palaepaphos, Old Paphos, one of the most celebrated places of pilgrimage in the ancient Greek world, and once an ancient city-kingdom of Cyprus. The ruins of the Temple of Aphrodite stand here, dating back as early as 12th century BC. The temple was one of the most important places of Aphrodite's cult and pilgrimage of the ancient world until the 3rd‚Äì4th centuries AD. The museum, housed in the Lusignan Manor, houses artifacts from the area. Yeroskipou is a town in Paphos' metropolitan area known for many years for its delight 'loukoumi'. North-east of Paphos lies Ayios Neophytos (St. Neophytos) Monastery, known for its \\"Encleistra\\" (Enclosure) carved out of the mountain by the hermit himself, which features some Byzantine frescoes from the 12th and 15th centuries. The painted village church of Emba (Empa) is nearby. Four kilometres () north of Paphos is the village of Lemba (Lempa), home to numerous artists, many of whom have open studio shops. It is home to the sculpture known as the Great Wall of Lempa by the Cypriot artist Stass Paraskos and the Cyprus College of Art. Off the coast of Paphos is the wreck of M/V Demetrios II which ran aground on 23 March 1998 in heavy seas during a voyage from Greece to Syria with a cargo of timber. Similarly, on 8 December 2011, the EDRO III ran aground off the coast of Cyprus. It is located near the Sea Caves of Paphos on the western shore of the island close to the Akamas Peninsula. Built in the 1960s, registered in Freetown, Sierra Leone, the Edro III is owed by an Albanian shipping company. It was traveling from Limassol, Cyprus to Rhodes when it ran aground. It is still shipwrecked to this day, although its cargo and fuel oil were removed. Local authorities are hesitant to remove the ship from the rocks due to the fact that the coastline is a protected natural park where turtles nest and endemic plant and animal species thrive. Climate \\"Tzielefos\\" Venetian bridge, Diarizos river, Paphos forest Mavrokolympos Dam Paphos enjoys a subtropical semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSh), with the greatest amounts of precipitation mainly occurring from mid-November to March. It almost never rains in the summer, (with an average of 0.1). In July and August, humidity measurements can go up to 85%. Snowfall occurs rarelyapproximately every 10 yearsand does not normally lead to any significant disruption. It occurs almost annually in the hills of Tsada, north. The last significant snowfall in the city centre occurred in the winter of 2001. Heatwaves in July and August are relatively common, when hot air masses from the Sahara desert drift over to Cyprus causing temperatures to rise. Cyprus has experienced drought-like conditions and the current trend of global warming may increase the severity of these conditions. In the summer of 2008, Cyprus had to ship water by tanker from Greece to meet demand on the island. Since then, water conditions have eased due to good winter rains. Another source with different averages classifies its climate as hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa), for the more average precipitation. Transport Paphos International Airport check-in desks Paphos was once the only traffic-free town in Cyprus; things changed after the urbanization and rise of the population in less than ten years. The roads in the town centre remain unchanged and are unable to accommodate the new level of traffic. The problems exist because some planned road links remain on paper, including: * 2nd part of the northern ring road * Western ring road * Airport road * Paphos ‚Äì Coral Bay road upgrade =Public transport= Public transport in Paphos is currently only served by buses under the company OSYPA LTD. For intercity transportation the main operator is Intercity Buses which offers daily connections across all cities in the Greek Cypriot territory. The main bus station is Karavella station. It is the nexus for all intercity routes and many of the local routes. The other major bus station in Paphos is the Kato Paphos Harbor station, located close to Paphos Harbor and the Paphos Archaeological Park. =Motorways= Chalk layers in A6 motorway (Cyprus) Paphos did not have a motorway link until 2001. It is now accessed through the A6 which connects Paphos with Limassol. The A7 motorway from Paphos to Polis was to have been completed by 2013, though work has not started yet due to the financial crisis in Cyprus. It is not known when or if this road will be built. =Airport= Since 1982, air traffic of Paphos is served by Paphos International Airport located southeast of the city, near Timi. It serves approximately 1.75 million people every year. A new terminal opened in late 2008 adjacent to the old one. =Port= The port is able to hold 300 boats and serves as a small marina and a fisherman shelter. The castle's square hosts Aphrodite's festival every September since 1998. Several other yearly events are hosted in the square, including the Paphos beer festival. Cargo and cruise ships use the Limassol Port away. A marina is planned to be constructed north, next to Coral Bay in Kissonerga. The new marina will serve up to 1,000 boats. Hospitals and medical centres Paphos has only one general hospital located at Anavargos, northeast of the city centre. It was built to replace the old hospital, which was demolished shortly after being abandoned; now, it is a modern medical centre. There was consideration that it might be turned into a university hospital when Neapolis University was opened; as of July 2017, this has not transpired. There are two hospices in the area: The Friends HospiceThe Friends' Hospice Paphos and the Archangel Michael Hospice, which is funded by the Catholic Church in Cyprus.Archangel Michael Hospice There are also several private clinics spread throughout the area, such as St George's Private Hospital, built in 1991. Education Neapolis University The Paphos municipality has 38 primary state schools, 8 secondary state schools (known as gymnasiums and lyceums), 4 privately run English schools and one privately run Russian school. =Higher education= The town of Paphos has one higher education institute that began accepting students in June 2010. The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and consists of 4 schools. Arts Paphos is known for its cultural and historical interests, including the Tomb of the Kings, Mosaics, castle and numerous churches, though it is also popular for its festivals and annual events. During September, Paphos holds an annual opera at the Paphos' Aphrodite Festival at the harbor. The castle serves as a backdrop and stage for the performance. Another annual event is Open Studios Cyprus which takes place during selected weekends in October. Selected artists open their studio doors to the general public and provide an informal environment to view and discuss the work with the artist. There are a number of privately owned galleries and exhibition spaces. Details and dates for the regular events can be found in the local English newspapers, such as Cyprus Weekly and Cyprus Monthly. Palia Ilektriki is an exhibition and conference space maintained by the Paphos Municipality. In the centre of the town, this converted plays host to both conferences and exhibitions throughout the year. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, Open Studios Cyprus used this location to launch the event with an Opening Art Exhibition. In 2012, Paphos won the title as European Capital of Culture 2017, under the Executive Direction of Ektor Tsatsoulis and the Artistic Director Spyros Pisinos. The 2014 British independent film Decline of an Empire, starring Peter O'Toole, was partially shot in and around Paphos and Akamas. Sports Paphos has a long history in sports with several football, basketball, volleyball teams. The Pafian gymnastic club is called Korivos, and it owns (via the Cyprus Athletic Organisation) the local Pafiako Stadium and the Aphroditi Sports hall. Stylianos Kyriakides (; 1910‚Äì1987), a marathon runner from Statos, won the 1946 Boston Marathon. According to a newspaper report, he was running with John Kelley near the end, when an old man shouted from the crowd, \\"For Greece, for your children!\\", inspiring him to pull away and win the race. Paphos was home to Turkish Cypriot sport team Baf √úlk√º Yurdu.

It is endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and was once thought to be conspecific with the blossom-headed parakeet (Psittacula roseata) but was later elevated to a full species. Plum-headed parakeets are found in flocks, the males having a pinkish purple head and the females, a grey head. They fly swiftly with twists and turns accompanied by their distinctive calls. Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the plum-headed parakeet in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in India. He used the French name Le perruche a teste bleu and the Latin name Psittaca cyanocephalos. The two stars (**) at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the plum-headed parakeet. Linnaeus included a terse description, coined the binomial name Psittacus cyanocephalus and cited Brisson's work. The specific name cyanocephalus/cyanocephala combines the Ancient Greek words kuanos \\"dark-blue\\" and -kephalos \\"-headed\\". This species is now placed in the genus Psittacula which was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800.Female foraging  Description  The plum-headed parakeet is a mainly green parrot, 33 cm long with a tail up to 22 cm. The male has a red head which shades to purple-blue on the back of the crown, nape and cheeks while the female has blueish-gray head. There is a narrow black neck collar with verdigris below on the nape and a black chin stripe that extends from the lower mandible. There is a red shoulder patch and the rump and tail are bluish-green, the latter tipped white. The upper mandible is orangish-yellow, and the lower mandible is dark. The female has a dull bluish grey head and lacks the black and verdigris collar which is replaced by yellow. The upper-mandible is corn-yellow and there is no black chin stripe or red shoulder patch. Immature birds have a green head and both mandibles are yellowish. The dark head is acquired after a year. The delicate bluish red appearance resembling the bloom of a peach is produced by a combination of blue from the optical effects produced by the rami of the feather and a red pigment in the barbules. Some authors have considered the species to have two subspecies, the nominate from peninsular India (type locality restricted to Gingee) and the population from the foothills of the Himalayas as bengalensis on the basis of the colour of the head in the male which is more red and less blue. Newer works consider the species to be monotypic. The different head colour and the white tip to the tail distinguish this species from the similar blossom-headed parakeet (Psittacula roseata). The shoulder patch is maroon coloured and the shorter tail is tipped yellow in P. roseata. A supposed species of parakeet, the so- called intermediate parakeet Psittacula intermedia is thought to be a hybrid of this and the slaty-headed parakeet (Psittacula himalayana).alt=  Habitat and distribution  The plum-headed parakeet is a bird of forest and open woodland, even in city gardens. They are found from the foothills of the Himalayas south to Sri Lanka. They are not found in the dry regions of western India. They are sometimes kept as pets and escaped birds have been noted in New York, Florida and in some places in the Middle East.  Behaviour and ecology  The plum-headed parakeet is a gregarious and noisy species with range of raucous calls. The usual flight and contact call is tuink? repeated now and then. The flight is swift and the bird often twists and turns rapidly. It makes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit and blossoms which make up its diet. They feed on grains, fruits, the fleshy petals of flowers (Salmalia, Butea) and sometimes raid agricultural fields and orchards. The breeding season in India is mainly from December to April and July to August in Sri Lanka. Courtship includes bill rubbing and courtship feeding. It nests in holes, chiselled out by the pair, in tree trunks, and lays 4‚Äì6 white eggs. The female appears to be solely responsible for incubation and feeding. They roost communally. In captivity it can learn to mimic beeps and short whistling tunes, and can talk very well. Neoaulobia psittaculae, a quill mite, has been described from the species. A species of Haemoproteus, H. handai, has been described from blood samples from the plum- headed parakeet.  History  alt=Ctesias of Cnidus, a 5th-century BC Greek physician to the emperor Artaxerxes II, who ruled the Achaemenid Empire, accompanied Artaxerxes on his 401 BC campaign against his brother Cyrus the Younger. He was author of the lost Indica, a description of India which he wrote based on his experience in Persia and information he gathered from Persian accounts. Fragments of the Indica were preserved by Photius of Constantinople in his Bibliotheca in the 9th century AD; one of these has been identified as describing Psittacula cyanocephala and its abilities as a talking bird. It is likely Ctesias saw the bird himself, with an Indian handler; though his description could also apply to Psittacula roseata, that species is native to areas far further east and is much less likely candidate in Greater Iran. In his summary of Ctesias, Photius wrote:  References  External links * Stamps of Sri Lankan birds plum-headed parakeet Birds of South Asia Least concern biota of Asia plum-headed parakeet plum-headed parakeet ","title":"Plum-headed parakeet"},{"id":"597883","text":"Popstars Live was an Australian music talent show television program similar to Australian Idol that aired on the Seven Network in early 2004. It was an evolution of the original Popstars TV show which aired between 2000 and 2002 on Seven. The show spawned a single and album that made the ARIA charts in April that year. Popstars Live premiered on the Seven Network in February 2004. It was scheduled to run for 16 weeks and was originally slated to air on Sunday and Wednesday nights. During its short run Popstars Live had a troubled history, with two key personnel, Christine Anu and John Paul Young, leaving the program in April 2004 while others have publicly expressed their own concerns about the show. The show was also a ratings failure. Origins Popstars Live was based on the original Popstars, a reality television program that was broadcast on the Seven Network between 2000 and 2002. The aim of that program was to select members for a group or a solo singer and follow the process of recording a single and/or album and the subsequent promotion of the record made by the artists. The Australian TV show saw the creation of three acts which enjoyed initial success: * Bardot (2000) a girl group number one single and album; * Scandal'us (2001) a mixed pop group, number one single, number two album; * Scott Cain (2002) a male singer, number one single. While the first season of Popstars was one of the most popular programs on Australian television in 2000, its popularity steadily declined in later seasons. In 2003, the Seven Network rested the concept. However, the success of Australian Idol, a show that became the most popular program on Australian television that year, soon led to the Seven Network revisiting the Popstars format. Record sales for Idol contestants also played a role in the resurrection of Popstars with Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian releasing an album Just as I Am that went six times platinum in Australia and runner up Shannon Noll's That's What I'm Talking About striking up sales of five times platinum. Hoping to emulate the success of BMG Records, which had signed on Sebastian and Noll, Universal Music quickly signed up for the new series. Format The first five episodes featured the selection of the finalists by the judges. The finalists would then sing live in front of an audience with one finalist being eliminated each week until the final winner is selected. The program aimed to attract a large proportion of voters under 25, a similar as Australian Idol. Cast The Popstars Team consisted of: * Luke Jacobz host; * Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum judge; * Christine Anu judge; * Shauna Jensen judge; * Tania Doko artist mentor; * John Paul Young artist mentor; The judges initially said that they would offer constructive criticism to the contestants unlike the strong and sometimes personal criticism offered by Mark Holden and Ian \\"Dicko\\" Dickson of rival series Australian Idol. Finalists The finalists were (in order of elimination): * Tarryn Wall * Renee Simone * Kiki Courtidis * Don Pancho * Daniel Hamill * Arrnott Olssen * Eleven (Luke and Nick) * Sarah Gardner - who made it into the top 63 in Australian Idol 2007 - see image 10 of the top 63 at http://www.australianidol.com.au/photos.html?xmlFile=830.xml * Miranda Murphy, from Perth, Western Australia. On 12 July 2004, her debut single debuted at number 19 on the Australian singles charts on 22 July 2004. After an unusually lengthy hiatus from the music scene, and a general lack of activity, it is widely suspected she has been dropped by her record company, due to poor single sales, and a national declining interest in 'bubblegum pop' products of talent quest programs. She now works at \\"Jaanz school of singing\\". * Kayne Taylor, from Melbourne, Victoria who won the 2004 Australian season. Contestants Bunny and Xy were axed from the program in controversial circumstances. Kayne Taylor ended up winning altogether, defeating Miranda Murphy in the final. Reception and controversies The first live performance attracted disappointing ratings when broadcast, attracting only 850,000 in Australian mainland capitals, finishing behind American Idol on Network Ten and shows on the Nine Network. David Leckie, the managing director of the Seven Network, blamed the disappointing ratings on what he considered to be the bland comments of the judges and pressured the producers to ensure that the judges made stronger comments. Christine Anu refused to offer harsh criticism of the contestants resigning in April 2004. In a statement issued on her departure, she said: \\"I chose to play a positive role model and wanted to encourage these young people in their endeavours, rather than criticise them. Although leaving Popstars Live was a difficult decision for me to make, I do feel somewhat relieved that I can now focus on my music.\\" John Paul Young was sacked although the producers claimed that his contract had finished. Ian \\"Molly\\" Meldrum and Tania Doko were also criticising elements of the program in the media in early April. Trevor Steel, a UK record producer and the former lead singer of eighties pop group The Escape Club, was brought in by Universal Music as a replacement judge to offer stronger criticism of contestants. Ratings for Popstars Live continued to decline for the next episode. With 2003 Australian ratings blockbuster The Block due to commence its 2004 season on the Nine Network and American Idol performing well on Network Ten, the Seven Network executives shifted the program from Sunday night to Saturday night and scheduled wildlife documentaries to fill the slot. As Saturday night is the night of the week when the fewest people watch television in Australia and when members of the target audience for Popstars Live are most likely to go out, this shift was widely perceived as an admission of defeat by network executives. The Saturday night program was dropped altogether a few episodes later, leaving only the Wednesday program. Album Universal Music released an album Popstars Live: The Finalists featuring the finalists singing versions of well-known songs. The first single \\"Stand Up Next to Me\\" features the finalists singing on the track. =Sales Performance= In their first week of sales from 5 April 2004, the single barely made the Australian Top 50 and the album could only debut at number 61. Although Universal Music shipped enough copies of both the single and the album to stores to achieve gold status in Australia (35,000 copies), the single and the album only sold one thousand copies. The single eventually reached #29 on the charts and the album reached the ARIA Top 50. Kayne Taylor's debut single Heartbreaker debuted in the top 10 of the Australian charts at the end of June 2004. Runner-up Miranda Murphy also had a debut single That Girl released, and it debuted in the top 20 a few weeks after. However, this didn't seem to boost the success of Popstars Live nor its contestants, with no others releasing singles, nor have Kayne or Miranda released a second single as of November 2004. This contrasts with the sales success of artists appearing on Australian Idol and to a lesser extent the original Popstars. With the television program being moved to a different timeslot less likely to catch the eyes of potential record buyers and the single failing to attract support of radio, it seems as though the album will disappoint the hopes of Universal Music who would have been hoping to match the success of BMG Records from Australian Idol contestants. =Track listing= The track listing for the album is: # \\"Stand Up Next To Me\\" (all finalists) # \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\" - Kiki (hit for Crowded House) # \\"Jealous Guy\\" - Kayne Taylor (hit for John Lennon and later Roxy Music) # \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\" - Miranda Murphy (hit for Roberta Flack and later the Fugees) # \\"Tainted Love\\" - Don Pancho (hit for Gloria Jones and later Soft Cell) # \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\" - Tarryn (originally a hit for Savage Garden) # \\"Beautiful\\" - Arrnott Olssen (hit for Christina Aguilera) # \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" - Renee Simone (originally by Prince, hit for Sin√©ad O'Connor) # \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" - Daniel Hamill (originally a hit for The Hollies) # \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" - Luke Parry and Nick de Silwa (originally a hit for Tears for Fears) # \\"Everlasting Love\\" - Sarah Gardner (originally a hit for a variety of artists including U2 and Gloria Estefan) # \\"You Will Always Shine\\" - Bunny and Xy written by Willie Allen See also * List of Australian music television shows External links * Popstar Live webpage * Australian music television series Australian reality television series Seven Network original programming 2004 Australian television series debuts 2004 Australian television series endings Popstars ","title":"Popstars Live"},{"id":"597884","text":"The blossom-headed parakeet (Psittacula roseata) is a parrot which is a resident breeder in Eastern Bangladesh, Bhutan, Northeast India and Nepal, eastwards into South-east Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam) and also China.

He is a former radio host and political analyst for KIRO and Air America Radio, where he hosted his own daily three- hour show. His liberal views contrast with those of his late father and conservative icon, President Ronald Reagan. Early life Reagan was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the son of Ronald Reagan and his second wife, Nancy Davis Reagan. The family lived in Sacramento while his father was governor, from 1967 His sister, Patti Davis, is five and a half years older. His elder brother Michael Reagan, adopted as an infant by Ronald Reagan and his first wife Jane Wyman, is 13 years older. He also had two half-sisters born to Reagan and Wyman, Maureen Reagan (1941‚Äì2001) and Christine Reagan, who was born prematurely, on June 26, 1947, and died the same day. At an early age, his father, Ronald Reagan, often joked that they were related to every royal family with the name O'Regan in Europe. Burke's Peerage provided the Reagans with their family tree, which lacked any direct connection to European royalty. Ron Reagan undertook a different philosophical and political path from his father at an early age. At 12, he told his parents that he would not be going to church anymore because he was an atheist.\\"20 Questions: Ron Reagan\\", by Betsy Rothstein, The Hill, September 24, 2008. Reagan attended and was expelled from The Webb School of California. He commented: > They [the school administration] thought I was a bad influence on the other > kids. As I recall, the immediate reason was I went to a dance at a > neighboring girl's school in a classmate's car. This was an infraction. They > had been looking for an excuse. I didn't get caught at anything. Reagan dropped out of Yale University in 1976 after one semester to become a ballet dancer. He joined the Joffrey Ballet in pursuit of his lifelong dream and participated in the Joffrey II Dancers, a troupe for beginning dancers, where he was mentored by Sally Brayley. Time wrote in 1980: \\"It is widely known that Ron's parents have not managed to see a single ballet performance of their son, who is clearly very good, having been selected to the Joffrey second company, and is their son nonetheless. Ron talks of his parents with much affection. But these absences are strange and go back a ways.\\" Reagan and Nancy went to see Ron perform at the Lisner Auditorium on Monday, May 18, 1981. The elder Reagan commented in his White House diary on this day that Ron's performance was reminiscent of Fred Astaire. Careers Reagan became more politically active after his father left the White House in 1989. In contrast to his father, the younger Reagan's views were unabashedly liberal. In a 2009 Vanity Fair interview, Ron said that he did not speak out politically during his father's term because the press \\"never cared about my opinions as such, only as they related to him\\", adding that he did not want to create the impression that he and his father were on bad terms because of political differences. In 1991, Reagan hosted The Ron Reagan Show, a syndicated late-night talk show addressing political issues of the day, which was canceled after a brief run since it was unable to compete with the higher ratings of The Arsenio Hall Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, and Nightline. Reagan has worked in recent years as a magazine journalist, and has hosted talk shows on cable TV networks such as the Animal Planet network. In Britain, he is best known for having co-presented Record Breakers (based on The Guinness Book of Records) for the BBC. Reagan presented a report from the United States each week.Profile, screenonline.org.uk; accessed September 2, 2014. He has served on the board of the Creative Coalition, an organization founded in 1989 by a group that included Susan Sarandon and Christopher Reeve, to politically mobilize entertainers and artists, generally for First Amendment rights, and causes such as arts advocacy and public education. From February to December 2005, Reagan co-hosted the talk show Connected: Coast to Coast with Monica Crowley on MSNBC. Until its demise in 2010, Air America Media aired The Ron Reagan Show. The program made its debut on September 8, 2008. In 2011, he published My Father at 100: A Memoir. In interviews promoting the book, Reagan described noticing his father was having certain mental lapses which, in hindsight, caused the younger Reagan to speculate subsequently that his father may have already been in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease while still in office. This assertion was attacked by critics, including his brother, Michael Reagan. Ron Reagan subsequently clarified that he did not feel the lapses were evidence of \\"dementia.\\"The Colbert Report, January 18, 2011 In February 1986, Reagan hosted Saturday Night Live. Political activities In July 2004, Reagan spoke at the Democratic National Convention about his support for lifting Bush's restrictions on federally funded embryonic stem cell research, from which he expected a cure or new treatments for Alzheimer's disease, of which his father had recently died. \\"There are those who would stand in the way of this remarkable future, who would deny the federal funding so crucial to basic research. A few of these folks, needless to say, are just grinding a political axe and they should be ashamed of themselves,\\" Ron Reagan said of the restrictions. \\"We can choose between the future and the past, between reason and ignorance, between true compassion and mere ideology.\\" Reagan's mother Nancy also supported this position.Nancy Reagan plea on stem cells. BBC News. May 10, 2004. In September 2004, he told the Sunday Herald newspaper that the George W. Bush Administration had \\"cheated to get into the White House. It's not something Americans ever want to think about their government. My sense of these people is that they don't have any respect for the public at large. They have a revolutionary mindset. I think they feel that anything they can do to prevail -- lie, cheat, whatever -- is justified by their revolutionary aims\\" and that he feared Bush was \\"hijacking\\" his father's reputation.Johnston, Jenifer. Reagan Junior Warns Bush: \\"Stop Hijacking My Father's Reputation\\". Sunday Herald. September 26, 2004. Reagan later wrote the essay \\"The Case Against George W. Bush by Ron Reagan\\" for Esquire. He voted for Democratic candidate John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. Reagan endorsed then- senator Barack Obama of Illinois for president in the 2008 presidential election.Reagan, Ron. Making It Official: I Endorse Barack Obama. The Huffington Post. October 31, 2008. In November 2015, Reagan endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2016 Democratic Party primaries. In early 2020, Reagan stated that his father would've opposed Donald Trump, remarking to The Daily Beast that his \\"father would have been ashamed of this Republican Party\\" as well as \\"been embarrassed and ashamed that a president of the United States was as incompetent and traitorous as the man occupying the White House now.\\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/ron-reagan-says-his-father-ronald-reagan- would-not-want-republicans-to-vote-for-traitor-trump-in-2020 Personal life Ron Reagan lives in Seattle. He married Doria Palmieri, a clinical psychologist, in 1980. She died in 2014 from neuromuscular disease. They had no children. He married Federica Basagni in July 2018. Reagan stated, in a 2004 New York Times interview, that he did not claim any religion, but that his sympathies were with Buddhism and his wife was a Buddhist. In a June 23, 2004, interview on CNN show Larry King Live, while discussing reasons why he would not run for political office, Ron Reagan stated \\"I'm an atheist. ... I can't be elected to anything because polls all say that people won't elect an atheist.\\" In February 2010, he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. In May 2014, Reagan appeared in an advertisement for broadcast on Comedy Central for the Freedom From Religion Foundation in which he declared himself \\"an unabashed atheist,\\" and one who is not afraid of \\"burning\\" in Hell. The ad received renewed attention in October 2019 when it aired on CNN during the fourth 2020 Democratic Presidential Debate.

As envisaged, the SR.53 would have been used as an interceptor aircraft, using its rocket propulsion to rapidly climb and approach incoming hostile bombers at high speeds; following its attack run, the aircraft would be able to return to its base by making use of the secondary jet propulsion instead. Although the SR.53 proved to have promising performance during test flights, the requirement for such an aircraft had been overtaken by rapid advances in surface-to-air missile technology, leading to reconsideration of the aircraft's purpose. In July 1960, the development programme was formally cancelled, by which time a total of 56 test flights had been performed. A pair of prototype SR.53 aircraft had been completed and used during flight tests. One of these was destroyed during one such test flight in June 1958. The other, the first prototype, survived and was preserved; it is currently on public display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. Design and development =Background= The Second World War had demonstrated the importance of strategic bombing to modern warfare, and as the emerging Cold War developed, the development of new and more effective air defences against large waves of hostile bomber aircraft armed with nuclear weapons became a priority for many nations. During the war, Nazi Germany had extensively developed its own rocket-powered aircraft to augment its interception capabilities, in the final two years of the war, it had been able to deploy aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 163 and Bachem Ba 349 which, via rocket propulsion, had been capable of unparalleled rates-of-climb, enabling them to (at least in theory) rapidly sortie to intercept enemy bombers before they reached their targets. As the performance of these aircraft had become increasingly well known to the Allies, RAF experts were eager to explore and understand the underlying technology.Wood 1975, p. 53. In the aftermath of the war, German rocket technology was studied extensively by various members of the former Allied nations. Britain had quickly opted to commence a programme to develop liquid-propellant rockets with the aim of boosting aircraft during the take-off phase, known within the RAF as rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG), and during the climb-to-altitude phase of flight. In 1946, work began on a pair of new British-built rocket motors, the de Havilland Sprite with a maximum thrust of and the Armstrong Siddeley Snarler with of thrust; these rocket motors made use of different propellants, the Sprite used a high-test peroxide (HTP) monopropellant while the Snarler harnessed a methanol/water/liquid oxygen mix. During the early 1950s, both engines proceeded to the flight testing phase; however, some of the demand for their role to provide fighters with increased performance was soon being met by the increasing prevalence of conventional jet engines being equipped with reheat instead. In May 1951, faced with reports on the increasingly potential capability of, and thus the threat posed by, the growing Soviet strategic bomber fleet and that nation's newly developed atomic weapons, the British Air Ministry proceeded to draft an Operational Requirement, OR 301, which sought a rocket-powered interceptor that could attain an altitude of in just 2 minutes 30 seconds. Many of the performance requirement laid out by OR 301 was due to the anticipation of rapid increases in performance by the opposing Soviet aircraft; by the early 1960s, it was suspected that these bombers might well be capable of supersonic speeds of up to Mach 2 with a potential operational altitude as high as .Wood 1975, pp. 53‚Äì54. Accordingly, a capable defence interceptor that could form part of the nation's measures to counter this threat would need to be capable of similar speeds and an exceptionally high rate of climb in order to reach high altitude bombers in time.Wood 1975, pp. 54‚Äì55. The development of the Sprite and the Snarler had led to the possibility of a more powerful rocket engine being developed as the planned powerplant for a viable \\"point defence\\" interceptor.London 2010, p. 29. The requirements of O.R. 301 were considered onerous, including a ramp launch and landing on a skid, and with the compliance of the companies which had approached to tender, the amended Specification F124T allowed for a mixed powerplant configuration along with the adoption of a conventional undercarriage. On 21 February 1951, the revised Specification F124T was circulated to half a dozen of Britain's various aircraft manufacturers to solicit their submissions.Wood 1975, p. 54. =Submissions and selection= Saunders-Roe had not been one of the companies who received the Specification; this is likely due to the Ministry of Supply not considering them to be relevant, as the firm had typically been involved in the production of flying boats. However, Saunders-Roe was in fact interested in the new requirement, having been already independently conducting studies into high-altitude and high-speed flight. Maurice Brennan, the company's chief designer, had already directed members of the design team to study the prospects of rocket-propelled aircraft capable of flying at altitudes of up to and had published a report entitled 'Investigation of Problems of Pure Rocket Fighter Aircraft' at the same time that the Ministry had issued Specification F124T.Dancey, Peter. British Aircraft Manufacturers Since 1909 Fonthill Media, 2014. . Saunders-Roe approached the Ministry on its failure to follow conventional policy in not dispatching the specification nor an invitation to tender to the firm; as a result, on 24 March 1951, the Ministry asked the company to submit its designs alongside the other competitors.Wood 1975, p. 55. By the end of April 1951, Saunders-Roe submitted their detailed proposal. The proposed single-seat aircraft, designated as the SR.53, was capable of very high speeds, being projected as being capable of a top speed of when at an altitude of , and a rate of climb of per minute around an altitude of . An auxiliary disposable undercarriage could be used for takeoffs, along with cordite-based booster rockets. In the event of an emergency, the entire cabin would have originally been jettisoned as a means of providing the pilot with a means of escape; due to the work involved in developing this, it was instead replaced by a more standard ejection seat arrangement. The firm had quickly identified that that original unpowered 'glide home' approach to be dangerous and expensive; they approached the Air Ministry with their concept of a secondary jet engine for the purposes of powering the aircraft's journey home. The Ministry was enthusiastic on this concept; in May 1951, all interested companies were asked to examine this arrangement. The SR.53 was a sleek aircraft with a sharply- pointed nose, delta-like wing, and a T-tail. It was powered by a combination of a single Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine and de Havilland Spectre rocket engine, the exhausts of which were mounted one atop the other on the rear fuselage beneath the tail.Winchester 2005, p. 223.Wood 1975, pp. 55‚Äì56. Saunders-Roe had originally proposed to develop their own rocket motor to power the SR.53, having not been initially pleased with the performance of either the Spectre nor the Screamer; however, it was recognised that this would take substantial development work. By October 1952, the basic outline of the aircraft had been finalised, replacing the combined flap and ailerons of earlier proposed with slotted flaps, the Viper engine was relocated upwards and was to be fitted with a straight jet pipe rather than a bifurcated one, the tailplane was also moved to a higher position at the top of the fin. On 30 October 1952, the company received an Instruction to Proceed from the Ministry for the completion of three prototypes. On 12 December 1952, further refinement of the concept led to the release of the defined Specification OR 337.London 2010, p. 31. The changes of the defined specification mainly revolved around armament changes, adopting the Blue Jay infrared-guided air- to-air missile, which replaced the originally-envisaged retractable battery of rockets.\\"The History of the Saunders Roe S.R.53 and S.R.177\\"Wood 1975, p. 56. During the first four months of 1953, Saunders-Roe had to perform a structural redesign of the SR.53's fuselage, wing, and undercarriage due to a determination by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) that the wing required a greater anhedral angle than had originally been designed for. On 5 May 1953, an advisory design conference was hosted at the Ministry of Supply focusing on the SR.53; three days later, a formal contract for the production of the three prototypes was received. Due to doubts within the RAF and the Ministry over the correct fuel/motor to select for the aircraft in order to meet the Specification, it was decided to issue a modified specification, and later a development contract, to A.V. Roe, who commenced work on their own rocket- powered interceptor, designated as the Avro 720. Of the six companies that tendered proposals, two were selected for development contracts: A.V. Roe with their Avro 720 and Saunders-Roe with the SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 56‚Äì57. =Issues and proposals= Saunders-Roe, recognising that it would need to outdo the competing Avro 720 if the SR.53 was to be likely to survive, upon having been issued with the contract to build the three prototypes, set a schedule that called for a first flight to be conducted in July 1954, along with a projected service introduction date of 1957.London 2010, p. 30.Wood 1975, p. 57. However, Wood observes that this was far too ambitious as it did not leave time to address the complexity of the aircraft, nor did it accommodate room for delays in the supply of the separately-produced Spectre engine. Unresolved issues with elements of the design caused a series of setbacks, including one notable incident in the form of an explosion occurring during ground tests of the Spectre rocket engine. Construction of the first SR.53 prototype took longer than anticipated, in part due to de Havilland having problems delivering the Spectre engine on time, installing auxiliary equipment was also time-consuming.Wood 1975, pp. 60‚Äì62. Accordingly, the maiden flight of the SR.53 began to fall further and further behind schedule. The date of the first flight was first set back to March 1955, and then into 1957. Unique challenges were posed by the HTP fuel, including the development of suitable storage bags and the fuel flow proportioner.Wood 1975, p. 60. In January 1954, the Ministry reduced its order from three SR.53 prototypes to two, which were constructed side by side at Saunders-Roe's Cowes facility. Development with the competing Avro 720 proceeded more smoothly; by 1956, its prototype was virtually complete and was viewed as being capable of flying up to a year ahead of the lagging SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 60‚Äì61. By September 1953, the programme to develop these aircraft came under scrutiny due to a need to implement cost cuts; as a result, the contract for the Avro 720 was eventually cancelled. One of the reasons for preferring the SR.53 was although the aircraft was developmentally behind, its use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser was viewed as less problematic than the Avro 720's use of liquid oxygen, which posed a fire hazard. According to Wood, there was a preference for the HTP approach, as used by the SR.53, alongside an unwillingness to continue to support the operation of two different fuel programmes.Wood 1975, p. 61. However, the validity of this reason is undermined somewhat by the fact that Avro had been proposing to switch to using HTP and the Spectre, the same engine that was used by the SR.53.Wood 1975, p. 59. Another factor that had influenced the cancellation was the hesitancy of the RAF to back either project, the service had apparently wanted to wait until after flight evaluations had been conducted before it was to make any determination on its preference. During late 1953, Saunders-Roe commenced work upon a derivative design, which was designated as the SR.177. Brennan considered the lack of an onboard radar on the SR.53 and the Avro 720 to have been a vital flaw despite it not being a requirement of the specification, leaving the pilot dependent on his own vision and direction being provided by ground-based radar control. Brennan had also been dissatisfied with the use of the turbojet engine; he believed that a larger jet engine should match the steady supersonic cruising speed of the aircraft, and that the rocket motor should be mainly used for high performance climbs, turns, and rapid acceleration instead. Accordingly, the SR.177 was a much larger and sophisticated aircraft that would provide for more range and overall superior performance to the SR.53.Wood 1975, pp. 57‚Äì58. It was sized to be able to carry a useful airborne radar, which Brennan had deemed to be essential for interception at the high altitudes in where the new fighter was meant to operate. The new, larger aircraft was also to be developed into separate versions for maritime use by the Royal Navy and for West Germany as well as for the RAF.Jones 1994, pp. 35, 38. Saunders-Roe worked on both the SR.53 and SR.177, the latter being worked on by a newly formed High Speed Development Section.Wood 1975, p. 58. Operational history Colour drawing of the first SR.53 In October 1951, Saunders-Roe obtained facilities at RAF Hurn, Dorset, to support the site's use as a base for test flights of the SR.53.Wood 1975, p. 62. This measure had been necessitated by a lack of suitable airfields on the Isle of Wight, where the company was based and typically conducted development from. To this end, the firm constructed a HTP storage faculty at the Hurn site; specialised radio aids were also installed and initially tested using a specially-modified Gloster Meteor which had been lent by the Ministry of Supply.Wood 1975, pp. 62‚Äì63. This setup would ultimately remain unused as flying trials were centered at RAF Boscombe Down instead. On 28 June 1956, the completed first prototype, XD145, was dispatched for assembly by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Boscombe Down.Wood 1975, p. 63. On 16 January 1957, the first installed ground run of its Spectre engine was performed; on 16 April 1957, this was followed by the first installed ground run of its Viper engine. On 9 May 1957, XD145 conducted the type's first ground taxiing trial. On 16 May 1957, Squadron Leader John Booth DFC was at the controls of XD145 for the first test flight, following up with the maiden flight of the second prototype XD151, on 6 December 1957. Test results indicated \\"...an extremely docile and exceedingly pleasant aircraft to fly, with very well harmonized controls\\". Both prototypes flew a total of 56 test flights, with Mach 1.33 speeds being obtained.London 2010, p. 34. While testing at RAE Boscombe Down, XD151 crashed on 5 June 1958 during an aborted takeoff on its 12th flight. Running off the runway, the aircraft struck a concrete approach light, exploding on impact and killing its pilot, Squadron Leader Booth.Winchester 2005, p. 222. The remaining prototype continued to fly with Lt Cdr Peter Lamb taking over the flight test programme. Cancellation It was 1957 before the first SR.53 took to the air, just over a month after the infamous 1957 Defence White Paper had been published outlining the British government's policy to largely abandon piloted aircraft in favour of concentrating on missile development. At the same time, jet engine development had progressed a long way in the six years since the SR.53's initial design. Combined with the fact that improvements in radar had meant that any incoming bomber threat could be detected much earlier, the need for an aircraft like the SR.53 had disappeared, and the project was cancelled on 29 July 1960, with the third prototype (XD153) never built.

It was an enlarged derivative of the Saunders-Roe SR.53, which was itself an experimental combined jet-and-rocket interceptor aircraft. The SR.177 principally differed from the smaller SR.53 in its adoption of a nose- mounted airborne interception radar unit, which allowed it to scan for and lock onto its own targets; a more powerful turbojet engine was also incorporated. In addition to British interests in the aircraft, the German Navy had also expressed their interest in the project and closely evaluated its progress with an eye towards its potential procurement. However, the SR.177 was ultimately cancelled as a result of changes in Britain's military policies in 1957. A much larger derivative of the SR.177 had been studied, which was designated as the SR.187, and was being developed with the intention of meeting the requirements of Operational Requirement F.155. However, this work was also cancelled in 1957. By the time of termination, approximately 90 per cent of the first prototype had been completed, while several other prototypes were in various states of completion.London 2010, p. 34. The prototypes were stored for several years while attempts were made to revive the project; while interest was present, including from Japan, nothing more came of the project and the remaining assets were broken up. Design and development =Background= In 1952, Saunders-Roe had been awarded a contract to develop a combined rocket-and-jet-propelled interceptor aircraft, which was designated as the Saunders-Roe SR.53.Wood 1975, p. 57. However, as development work on the project progressed, the shortcomings of the design became increasingly evident. Most particularly, as with the German rocket- powered interceptors of the Second World War, the range and endurance of such an aircraft were limited by the high rate of fuel consumption by the rocket engine. However, as turbojet engines developed and became increasingly powerful and efficient, new powerplants were quickly becoming available that would make such aircraft more practical.Winchester 2005, p. 223. Maurice Brennan, the chief designer of the SR.53, had also become convinced of the necessity for an airborne radar unit to be carried by the aircraft, as the SR.53 was reliant upon on ground-based radar guidance and the pilot's own vision to intercept aircraft. In particular, it was feared that pilots would be unable to focus their eyes properly at the altitude that the SR.53 was capable of. Out of a combined desire to equip the aircraft with a radar unit and to make greater use of turbojet power, a more ambitious design began to be drawn up.Wood 1975, pp. 57-58. While it had begun as an advanced design concept for the SR.53, upon the issuing of a development contract by the Ministry of Defence in May 1955 (to meet specification F.155), the project was given its own designation as the SR.177.Wood 1986, p. 61. As work continued on the SR.53, a separate High Speed Development Section was formed by Saunders- Roe to work on the SR.177.Wood 1975, p. 58. Initially, the SR.177 was a straightforward development of the SR.53, sharing much of the same configuration and equipment, and it was envisioned that the first test flight would take place during the first half of 1957. However, in February 1955, an extensive redesign of the SR.177, with the aim of making the type suitable for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy, was commenced. Of the changes made to the aircraft, major differences included the repositioning of the jet engine to the lower fuselage lobe, which was now fed with air via a large, chin- mounted intake; the wing was also enlarged and blown flaps were adopted. The turbojet engine selected was the de Havilland Gyron Junior, capable of generating of thrust.Wood 1975, p. 59. =Project launch= In September 1955, Saunders-Roe received instructions to proceed on the SR.177 from the British Ministry of Supply. The Ministry also gave instruction for the production of mock-ups, windtunnel tests, and the development of construction jigs for the manufacture of an initial batch of aircraft.Wood 1975, pp. 63-64. From the onset, the SR.177 faced competition in the form of an enlarged derivative of the Avro 720, which had itself been devised as a competitor against the smaller SR.53. Avro promoted the 720 to the Royal Navy, hoping to win favour away from the SR.177, which was by this point had reached the detail design phase.Wood 1975, pp. 59-60. The Ministry ultimately opted to cancel all work on the Avro 720, primarily as a cost-saving measure, as well as to concentrate development work on HTP-based rocket motors, such as those powering the SR.53 and SR.177.Wood 1975, p. 61. The most significant difference between the SR.53 and SR.177 was the latter's use of a jet engine with nearly five times the thrust of the one adopted for the former. While the SR.53 had relied mostly on its rocket engine for climbing, the SR.177 would be able to add considerable endurance by conserving use of its rocket for the dash towards a target only. It was expected that the added endurance would allow the SR.177 to perform roles other than pure interception; these roles were expected to include strike and reconnaissance missions. The SR.53 design had been considerably enlarged to accommodate the new engine, and the original sleek lines were forfeited for the chin-mounted air intake.Wood 1986, p. 62. Following the maiden flight of the SR.53 in May 1957, the development of the SR.177 became the main focus of activity at Saunders-Roe.Wood 1975, p. 63. At this point, the project was viewed as having considerable large scale potential, as both the RAF and Royal Navy appeared to be set to be customers for the SR.177. The RAF sought to operate it alongside the incoming English Electric Lightning interceptors while, according to aviation author Derek Wood, the Royal Navy also had considerable interest in the programme. When the development contract had been issued in May 1955, it reflected this dual interest. The Navy's requirements were defined in NA.47 while the RAF's requirements were specified in OR.337, which had been issued by the Ministry of Supply as Operational Requirement F.155. There was optimism that a joint aircraft for the two services could be developed, saving considerable expense, time, and effort.Wood 1975, p. 64. Negotiations on the exact number of aircraft sought by either service were protracted; but it had been established that there was demand for an initial batch of 27 SR.177 aircraft, and that sufficient tooling should be produced to enable the programme to transition rapidly to full-rate production. By April 1956, a consensus had emerged that, in order for the first five SR.177s to be completed by January 1958, these aircraft would be produced without any A.I. radar or the ability to support armaments. In July 1956, funding was secured for 27 aircraft to be produced, the first of which being expected to fly by April (later postponed to October) 1958. On 4 September 1956, a formal contract for the 27 aircraft was issued, which was sub-divided into four batches of five, four, four, and fourteen respectively, although the final eighteen were subject to evaluation and were thus pending confirmation.Wood 1975, p. 64. During 1957, a development contract for the SR.177 was announced for its use with the Royal Navy.\\"From All Quarters: SR.177 Development Contract.\\" Flight, 18 October 1957, p. 602. By January 1957, the design of the main component jigs was 70 per cent complete while the component assembly jigs were almost 50 per cent complete; the manufacture of a quantity production batch was nearing, which would have likely been subcontracted to another aviation company due to the high level of workload at Saunders-Roe's Cowes facility.Wood 1975, p. 66. Armstrong Whitworth, who had already taken over work on the basic wing design of the SR.177, had been selected as the second production outlet for the type. The selection of a production center for the SR.177 was complicated by a favourable event; interest in the programme from the West German government. Since 1955, the revived German Air Force had sought a suitable high performance aircraft to equip itself with, and there were hopes that the SR.177 could become the foundation of a collaborative European fighter programme. The German Defence Ministry had first expressed interest in the SR.177 in October 1955; in February 1956, the British Government Committee on Security consented to discussions being held on the SR.177.Wood 1975, pp. 66-67. The prospects of a large German order for as many as 200 aircraft, and for the SR.177 to be manufactured under licence in Germany by the recovering German aircraft industry, were soon being aired, of which the British government declared its openness towards.Wood 1975, p. 67. In January 1957, the Anglo-German Standing Committee on Arms Supply reported that General Kammhuber, the Commander-in- Chief of the German Air Force, was concerned that, due to a lack of available financing until April 1958, the delivery timetable may not be satisfactory. According to Wood, Germany was keen to issue an order as soon as possible by this point.Wood 1975, pp. 67-68. =Decline and cancellation= During 1957, the fate of the SR.177 was to be subject to a massive re-thinking of air defence philosophy in Britain, being principally outlined in the 1957 Defence White Paper, which called for manned combat aircraft to be replaced by missiles. Very shortly afterwards, OR.337 was cancelled and the prospects of an order from the RAF had evaporated.Wood 1975, pp. 68-69. This was a serious blow, while it the Royal Navy and Germany remained potential customers for the SR.177, the confidence of both parties was shaken by the move.Wood 1975, p. 69. Work on the SR.177 continued for a little longer, however, in the anticipation of continued interest from Germany. In September 1957, Aubrey Jones, the Minister of Supply, was keen to support the programme and had agreed to continue funding development of five of the six prototypes. However, according to Wood, the SR.177 was subject to political in-fighting between Aubrey Jones and Duncan Sandys, the minister who had been the prime advocate of the Defence White Paper. While Jones assured German officials that the SR.177 project was continuing, Sandys contacted them to inform them that the aircraft was effectively dead. These mixed messages led to considerable confusion and apprehension within the German Defence Ministry. Further difficulty was added when, in response to lobbying by Rolls-Royce Limited, the German government insisted that the Rolls-Royce RB.153 engine be used in place of the Gyron Junior, causing Saunders-Roe to work on a further hasty redesign of SR.177. The German government also decided to change its priorities from seeking an interceptor aircraft to acquiring a strike fighter instead, leading Saunders-Roe to redesign the aircraft for this role. However, even with Heinkel preparing to manufacture the SR.177 locally under licence, Germany chose to withdraw support from the venture in December 1957. The Minister had visited the German government in November 1957 as the Germans wanted the arrangements to be between governments instead of between their government and Saunders-Roe.\\"West German Defence Policy.\\" Flight, 14 February 1958, p. 195. Of the remaining aircraft under consideration, the West German Government chose to purchase a development of the American Lockheed F-104 Starfighter interceptor instead to meet the role of \\"high-altitude reconnaissance machine, a tactical fighter-bomber, and an all-weather fighter\\", along with the majority of European governments. This Lockheed coup, known as the \\"Deal of the Century\\", caused major political controversy in Europe and the West German Minister of Defence Franz Josef Strauss was almost forced to resign over the issue. During later investigation into Lockheed's business practices, it was discovered that Lockheed had paid out millions of dollars in \\"sales incentives\\" in each of these countries in order to secure the deal. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands confessed to taking more than one million dollars in bribes from Lockheed to buy the F-104.Wood 1986, pp. 67‚Äì69. Following the withdrawal of German interest and there being no requirement for the SR.177 by the RAF, the existing Royal Navy requirement was considered not worthwhile to proceed with. Accordingly, the Ministry of Supply soon chose to cancel the project. On 24 December 1957, a letter from the Ministry was received by Saunders-Roe, announcing the decision to terminate.Wood 1975, p. 70. Saunders- Roe announced that it expected to make 1,000 workers redundant as a result of the termination. As the jigs and near-complete aircraft was disassembled during the New Year, it was decided that the aircraft assemblies themselves should be stored in the event of the project being revived. In 1958, the SR.177 received one last burst of interest when Japan, which was interested in developing a rocket-jet fighter itself, approached Britain with a request for quotations for the purchase of the two prototype SR.53s along with the completion of two SR.177s. However, due to a lack of backing from the British government, this initiative did not come to anything; the Japanese ultimately turned to the F-104 as well. Woods summarises the cancellation of the SR.177 as: \\"...it could ultimately have been built in hundreds or thousands. Due to ridiculous defence policies and a complete lack of Whitehall inter- departmental collaboration in the technology field, one of the most promising projects in a decade was destroyed\\".

It flows from Lake Nipissing west to Georgian Bay.PWGSC, French River & Lake Nipissing The river largely follows the boundary between the Parry Sound District and the Sudbury District, and in most contexts is considered the dividing line between Northern and Southern Ontario. The French River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1986. Geography The French River flows through typical Canadian Shield country, in many places exposing rugged glaciated rock but also through heavily forested areas on the upper portion. The mouth of the river contains countless islands and numerous channels which vary from narrow, enclosed steep-walled gorges, falls and rapids, to broad expanses of open water. Tributaries of this river include the: *Wanapitei River *Pillow River *Murdock River *Wolseley River *Little French River *Pickerel River *Restoule River *Hall River History The steamship Kawigamog carried cargo and passengers on the Pickerel River, a tributary of the French River system from 1913 to 1928. It was used as a transportation corridor by the Algonquian peoples of this region. The Ojibwa named it Wemitigoj-Sibi.Bill Steer, \\"Past and future collide at the French River\\". North Bay Nugget, August 29, 2019. It became known to Europeans as the \\"French River\\" because it became associated with French explorers of the 17th century, including √âtienne Br√ªl√©, Samuel de Champlain and Pierre-Esprit Radisson, and missionaries. Other explorers who later followed this route included Simon Fraser, Alexander Mackenzie and David Thompson. Together with the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers, the French River formed part of the water highway from Montreal to Lake Superior in the days of the fur trade. It remained a major canoe route until about 1820. Around 1855, the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada provided newfound access to the area and the Georgian Bay. This led to increased exploration and interest for fishing and logging during the era of the Industrial Revolution. After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, there was a boom in logging along with the creation of Lumber barons in the Great Lakes. The French River was \\"ripe for the picking with its seemingly inexhaustible supply of timber and proximity to the American markets\\". Near the end of the 19th century, logging became the primary activity in the area. It was later settled as a summer tourist and recreation area. For this reason, the French River was designated a Canadian Heritage River in 1985. Because of the rugged nature of the Canadian Shield country surrounding this river, large parts of this river remain relatively untouched and it is now a popular location for recreational canoeing, kayaking, photography, camping, fishing and boating. Following bouts of overfishing, in the 1994 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources placed a slot limit on fishing to protect prime breeding year classes and increase the trophy fish population in the French River. French River Waterway Provincial Park Most of the river's shores from Lake Nipissing to the Georgian Bay, except for the land occupied by the Dokis First Nation between the Upper and Lower French River, have been protected and designated as a provincial waterway park. There are 230 undeveloped back-country campsites available in the park along the river. French River continues to attract vacationers and cottage owners who enjoy the clear water, rocky shores and pine growth forests.

He later sat as MP for Westminster. Family He was the youngest son of Michael Warren and Catherine Plunkett, n√©e Aylmer (his mother was the first wife of Sir Nicholas Plunkett). A brother of his mother was Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (died 1720), admiral and commander-in-chief, had entered the navy under the protection of the Duke of Buckingham, as a lieutenant, in 1678, and helped secure positions for first Oliver Warren, Peter's older brother, and later, Peter. Career In 1716, when he was 13 years old, Warren signed on as an ordinary seaman in Dublin, Ireland and he and his brother initially served together. He rapidly rose in the ranks, becoming a captain in 1727. His ship patrolled American colonial waters to provide protection from French forces. He became involved in colonial politics and land speculation. In 1744, he was made commodore and commanded a 16-ship squadron off the Leeward Islands, capturing 24 ships in four months. The Capture of the Marquise d'Antin and Louis Erasme by the English Privateers Duke and Prince Frederick, 10 July 1745 In 1745, Warren commanded a group of ships, the so called 'Royal Family squadron',https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Walker,_George_(d.1777)_(DNB00) that supported the Massachusetts forces in the capture of Louisbourg. The prize system of the time allowed naval officers to profit from the capture of enemy ships, and this expedition earned Warren a fortune, a promotion to the rank of Rear-Admiral of the Blue, and a knighthood. From July 1747 to 3 August 1747 he was appointed to the command of the Western Squadron. He was second in command of the British fleet on the Devonshire at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. His conduct in the battle won him further fame, a promotion to Vice-Admiral of the Red,Warren Monument, Westminster Abbey and much prize-money. While on a visit to Ireland in 1752, he died suddenly in Dublin \\"of a most Violent fever.\\"Donald I. Stoetzel, Encyclopedia of the French & Indian War in North America, 1754‚Äì1763 Warren's lands included several thousand acres on the south side of the Mohawk River west of Schenectady, New York, now known as Florida, Montgomery County, New York, roughly across from present day Amsterdam. He brought two nephews, William Johnson, eventually Sir William Johnson, and Michael Tyrrell to clear and manage the land. Tyrrell soon left, asking his uncle for support with a naval appointment. Tyrrell had a very distinguished naval career, rising to admiral. He became sick while headed to London from the West Indies, and was buried at sea. In 1741, Warren built Warren House, a mansion overlooking the Hudson River on his 300-acre (120-hectare) estate in Greenwich Village.Letter of William L. Stone, The American Historical Register, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 1895 He also owned property on Long Island (Warren's Wharf), the van Cortland Estate (Westchester County, New York), and South Carolina. Eighteen months before his death, Warren purchased 151 acres along the Delaware River in what is today the Tacony neighborhood of Philadelphia. The land became the Magnolia Grove estate of wealthy Philadelphia merchant, Thomas Gordon, about 1764, and later, of Gordon's son in-law, John Saltar, of the Monmouth County, New Jersey, Saltar's. Fanny Saltar's \\"Reminiscences of Colonial Days in Philadelphia\\" were written at her home on the property, Magnolia Cottage. Personal life In 1731, he married Susannah Delancey (1707‚Äì1771), a daughter of Stephen Delancey, and sister of James Delancey, chief justice and lieutenant governor of the province of New York. She was also a descendant of the Schuyler family and the Van Cortlandt family. Together, Warren and his wife had six children, two of whom, a daughter and his only son died in 1744 during the smallpox epidemic in New York. He moved his wife and three surviving daughters to England in 1747. Catherine, his youngest daughter, was a few months old at the time of his death, and died at age three or four. Warren's daughter Susanna married Colonel William Skinner (not to be confused with Lt. General William Skinner, who became chief engineer of Great Britain), who was a brother of American Revolution General Cortlandt Skinner, and both brothers were grandsons of Stephanus Van Cortlandt, and thus cousins of Susannah DeLancey. This meant that William Skinner and Susannah Warren were cousins, once removed. Warren's granddaughter, Susanna Maria Skinner, was married to Henry Gage, 3rd Viscount Gage, son of General Thomas Gage. As Thomas Gage's wife, Margaret Kemble, was the daughter of Susannah Delancey's cousin, Gertrude Bayard, this made Susannah Skinner and Henry Gage both second cousins, once removed (via William Skinner) and third cousins (via Susanna Warren). (Cortlandt Skinner's daughter Catherine was married to Sir William Henry Robinson, a son of Beverley Robinson. Beverley Robinson was a first cousin once removed of Judith Robinson, first wife of the rebel Carter Braxton). =Legacy= The towns of Warren, Rhode Island and Warren, New Hampshire are named after him.

The shehnai is a musical instrument, originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is made out of wood, with a double reed at one end and a metal or wooden flared bell at the other end.Shehnai Britannica.com.Ranade. p. 307.Hoiberg, p. 1 Its sound is thought to create and maintain a sense of auspiciousness and sanctity and, as a result, is widely used during marriages, processions and in temples although it is also played in concerts. It was a part of the naubat or traditional ensemble of nine instruments found in the royal court. The shehnai is similar to South India's nadaswaram and the indian Bansuri.  Characteristics  This tubular instrument gradually broadens towards the lower end. It usually has between six and nine holes. It employs one set of quadruple reeds, making it a quadruple reed woodwind. To master the instrument, the musician must employ various and intricate embouchure and fingering techniques. The shehnai has a range of two octaves, from the A below middle C to the A one line above the treble clef (A3 to A5 in scientific pitch notation). A shehnai is often but not always made with a body of wood or bamboo and a flared metal end.  Origin of the shehnai  The shehnai is thought to have been developed by improving upon the pungi (a woodwind folk instrument used primarily for snake charming). Another theory of the origin of the shehnai is that the name is a modification of the word \\"sur-nal\\". The word nal/nali/nad is used in many Indian languages to mean pipe or reed. The word \\"sur\\" means tone or tune‚Äîmusical note or simply music‚Äîand is used as a prefix to the names of many Indian instruments. The \\"sur-nal\\" is said to have given its name to the \\"surna/zurna\\" of the old Persian Empire, which is the name by which the reed- pipe is known throughout the Middle East and eastern Europe. Shehnai is usually played at traditional North Indian weddings and is associated with the bride leaving her parental house for her husband's house.Dileep Karanth, The Indian Oboe Reexamined, E-ASPAC 2005, retrieved 5 May 2008 Sometimes, two shehnais can be tied together, making it a double shawm similar to the ancient Greek aulos.Chalumeau double (picture from the book \\"Illustrated encyclopedia of Musical Instruments\\".there are also reeds that are blown through to make it vibrate to make the sound come out The counterparts to the shehnai played in West India and Coastal Karnataka are indigenous to the territory.

Once at Oxford it became known as ‚ÄòArtsake‚Äô and employed a large number of Hands‚Äô fellow students. While at university, he became friends with William Hague, who was later best man at his wedding, in 1984, to Julia Caroline Ablethorpe. The couple have two sons and two daughters. His wife's house in Kent, just outside Sevenoaks, was once presented to Winston Churchill, while his family's estate in Tuscany, Villa Saletta, produces wine and olive oil. The estate's wines have won several awards.Wine Details: Borgo Saletta - IGT Rosso Toscana 2006 . International Wine and Spirit Competition 2006Saletta wine description . Villa Saletta website Hands and his wife own the Hand Picked Hotels chain of 20 English country house properties, which is run by Julia Hands. In April 2009, in protest at the UK tax system, Hands moved to the Bailiwick of Guernsey. Since then, he has not been to the UK and his family travel to Guernsey to see him. The writer Malcolm Gladwell called the move to Guernsey an ‚Äúincredibly interesting pathology‚Äù, seeing exile from the UK as a significant reverse in the benefits of being immensely wealthy.Foley, Stephen (19 September 2014) Running with the FT: Malcolm Gladwell FT.com In 2017 Guy and Julia Hands agreed to a deal to acquire McDonald's Nordic operations. The Nordic countries consist of approximately 435 restaurants, 95% of which are franchised. The deal will see Hands become the developmental licensee and master franchiser for McDonald's in the region. In May 2019 he admitted to The Times that he had an addiction to roast potatoes and gravy and that he had sought treatment from hypnosis to combat it.  Philanthropy  The Hands family support a number of charities including the Prince's Trust, King's College, Cambridge, Duke of Edinburgh Awards,DofE Supporters . The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Kids Company, The Eve Appeal, Hospice in the Weald, ICAN, and Outward Bound. They have also been significant supporters of Mansfield College, Oxford. In recognition of their significant contributions, Mansfield hosts an annual Hands Lecture series, whose speakers have included Lord Mandelson, David Boies and Bob Geldof. Since 2014, the Hands family has donated ¬£2.2 million towards Mansfield's Love Lane building, which will house the University's new Institute of Human Rights. Hands first donated money to Mansfield College in 1995, and has since been active in its development. One of the areas of change Hands has been vocal on was the decision to focus on providing educational access to ‚Äònon-typical students‚Äô. The College now claims a UK state school intake of 91.4% compared with just under 60% for the rest of the University - a statistic which Hands stated ‚Äòputs Mansfield in a different league‚Äô. Through Terra Firma London, Hands donates 10% of pre-tax profits to the Terra Firma Charitable Trust and Impetus - The Private Equity Foundation, with these donations going to local communities in Southwark in South London where the company has offices. Hands was named the 2018 Philanthropist of The Year at the annual Spear's Wealth Management Awards for his contributions to a number of charities.

After the enormous success of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, Iron Butterfly modified its acid-rock sound somewhat and experimented with more melodic compositions. The band's trademark heavy guitars, however, are still evident on such tracks as \\"In the Time of Our Lives\\" and \\"It Must Be Love\\". The album reached number 3 on the Billboard 200 charts, making Ball more immediately successful than In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Ball was certified Gold in March 1969. It also spawned two minor hit singles: \\"Soul Experience\\", an uncharacteristically uplifting song for the group, went to number 75 on the Billboard charts, and despite its nightmarish musical tones and morbid lyrics, \\"In the Time of Our Lives\\" managed to reach number 96.Joynson, Vernon (1995).

Some scholars exclude pre-sectarian Buddhism when using the term. The term Theravada refers to Buddhist practices based on these early teachings, as preserved in the PƒÅli Canon.  In Indian Buddhism  = Overview = Early Buddhism in India is generally divided into various monastic fraternities, or nikƒÅyas. Conventionally numbering eighteen, the actual count varied over time. The doctrinal orientation of each school differed somewhat, as did the number of pi·π≠akas in their canon. An example of this is the Dharmaguptaka, which included a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka and a DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ Pi·π≠aka. = In the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch = The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika nikƒÅyas generally advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats. Therefore, for the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, the bodhisattva ideal and buddhahood was advocated over the ideal of becoming an arhat. Avalokitavrata wrote of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas as using a \\"Great ƒÄgama Pi·π≠aka\\", which is then associated with MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ and the Ten Stages Sutra. In the Caitika group of nikƒÅyas, the P≈´rva≈õailas and the Apara≈õailas each were known to have the ' in Prakrit. BhƒÅvaviveka also wrote of the SiddhƒÅrthikas using a VidyƒÅdhƒÅra Pi·π≠aka, and the P≈´rva≈õailas and Apara≈õailas both using a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, implying organized collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts within these MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika nikƒÅyas. =In the SthaviravƒÅda branch= In the Sthavira nikƒÅya, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins were a major nikƒÅya. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin ' is known to employ the outlook of Buddhist practice as consisting of three vehicles: ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna, PratyekabuddhayƒÅna, and BodhisattvayƒÅna. References to the BodhisattvayƒÅna and the practice of the Six pƒÅramitƒÅs are commonly found in SarvƒÅstivƒÅda works as well. The Theravada sect from Sri Lanka generally accepts the three vehicles, but categorizes these as three different types of bodhi, or enlightenment. The Theravada nikaya only uses the PƒÅli Canon, which has three pi·π≠akas, and does not contain separate literature for bodhisattvas. Walpola Rahula writes of this, \\"At the end of a religious ceremony or an act of piety, the bhikkhu who gives benedictions, usually admonishes the congregation to make a resolution to attain Nirvana by realising one of the three Bodhis - Sravakabodhi, Pratyekabodhi or Samyaksambodhi - as they wish according to their capacity.\\"  Relationship to MahƒÅyƒÅna  Jan Nattier writes that there is also no evidence that MahƒÅyƒÅna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Paul Williams has similarly noted that the MahƒÅyƒÅna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the Indian nikƒÅyas, and therefore each bhik·π£u or bhik·π£u·πáƒ´ adhering to the MahƒÅyƒÅna formally belonged to one of these nikƒÅyas. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka nikƒÅya in East Asia, and the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda nikƒÅya in Tibetan Buddhism. \\"Hinayana\\" and Nikaya Buddhism Many commentors on Buddhism have used the term Hƒ´nayƒÅna to refer to NikƒÅya Buddhism. However, that term is now generally seen as flawed: * Hƒ´nayƒÅna, (literally \\"inferior vehicle\\"), is often regarded as an offensive or pejorative term. * Hƒ´nayƒÅna was coined by the MahƒÅyƒÅna, and has never been used by NikƒÅya Buddhists to refer to themselves. * Hƒ´nayƒÅna as a technical term, indicated the vehicles of both the SƒÅvakabuddha and the pratyekabuddha, whereas as a division of Buddhism, it refers solely to the individuals who follow the former vehicle, towards the achievement of Savakabuddhahood, while the MahƒÅyƒÅna in the sense of the bodhisattva path existed within the early schools already. * It is sensible to use a terms for a division of population which is ideally used by themselves, and failing that, at least not offensive to them. According to Robert Thurman, the term \\"NikƒÅya Buddhism\\" was coined by Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University, as a way to avoid the usage of the term Hinayana. \\"Nikaya Buddhism\\" is thus an attempt to find a more neutral way of referring to Buddhists who follow one of the early Buddhist schools, and their practice. The term ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna (literally, \\"hearer vehicle\\" or \\"disciples' vehicle\\") is also sometimes used for the same purpose. Other terms that have been used in similar senses include sectarian Buddhism or conservative Buddhism. Note that nikƒÅya is also a term used in TheravƒÅda Buddhism to refer to a subschool or subsect within Theravada. Like the term Hinayana Buddhism, the term NikƒÅya Buddhism focuses on the presumed commonality between the schools, and not on the actual schools themselves. This commonality is thought to be found in a certain attitude. The term \\"NikƒÅya Buddhism\\" tries to shift the attention to the more neutral issue of attitude concerning the authenticity of scriptures. A concise analysis by the Tibetan Buddhist, Reginald Ray, summarises the mistaken and confusing use of the term \\"Hƒ´nayƒÅna\\" to refer to any contemporary extant schools: See also *Early Buddhist schools References =Bibliography=   Nikaya schools Schools of Buddhism ","title":"Nikaya Buddhism"},{"id":"597958","title":"Chaudhry Muhammad Ali"},{"id":"597959","text":"The year 1763 in architecture involved some significant architectural events and new buildings.

Noted for his use of wordplay, multiple writers at AllMusic, HipHopDX and The Source have praised Coleman for his lyrical ability, and he has also been described as \\"one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip-hop history.\\" Regarding Coleman's legacy in an interview with Funkmaster Flex, Nas claimed \\"[Coleman] scared me to death. When I heard [his performance at the Apollo Theater] on tape, I was scared to death. I said, 'Yo, it's no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'\\" Early life Lamont Coleman was born in Harlem, New York City, on May 30, 1974, the third and youngest child of Gilda Terry (d. 2008) and Charles Davis. Davis left the family while Coleman was a child. His two older siblings, Donald Coleman and Leroy Phinazee (d. 2002), were the children of Gilda and a man named Mr. Phinazee. Coleman received the nicknames \\"Little L\\" and \\"'mont 'mont\\" as a child. At the age of 12, Coleman became a big hip hop fan and started freestyling with other people in his neighborhood. He founded a group known as Three the Hard Way in 1990, but it was quickly broken up due to a lack of enthusiasm amongst the members. It consisted of Coleman, Doc Reem, and Rodney. No projects were released, and after Rodney left, the group was renamed Two Hard Motherfuckers. Around this time, people started to refer to Coleman as \\"Big L\\". In the summer of 1990, Coleman met Lord Finesse at an autograph session in a record shop on 125th Street. After he did a freestyle, Finesse and Coleman exchanged numbers. Coleman attended Julia Richman High School. While in high school, Coleman freestyle battled in his hometown; in his last interview, he stated, \\"in the beginning, all I ever saw me doing was battling everybody on the street corners, rhyming in the hallways, beating on the wall, rhyming to my friends. Every now and then, a house party, grab the mic, a block party, grab the mic.\\" He graduated in 1992. Coleman began writing rhymes in 1990. Career =1992‚Äì1995: First recordings and record deal= In 1992, Coleman recorded various demos, some of which were featured on his debut album Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous, he also founded the Harlem rap group Children of the Corn (COC) with Killa Cam (Cam'ron), Murda Mase (Ma$e), Bloodshed and McGruff in 1993.Hess (2010), p. 40 On February 11, Coleman appeared on Yo! MTV Raps with Lord Finesse to help promote Finesse's studio album Return of the Funky Man. Coleman's first professional appearance came on \\"Yes You May (Remix)\\", the B-side of \\"Party Over Here\\" (1992) by Lord Finesse, and his first album appearance was on \\"Represent\\" off of Showbiz & A.G.'s Runaway Slave (1992). In that same year, he won an amateur freestyle battle, which consisted of about 2,000 contestants and held by Nubian Productions. In 1992, Coleman signed to Columbia Records. Around this time, L joined Lord Finesse's Bronx-based hip hop collective Diggin' in the Crates Crew (DITC) which consisted of Lord Finesse, Diamond D, O.C., Fat Joe, Buckwild, Showbiz and A.G. In 1993, Coleman released his first promotional single, \\"Devil's Son\\", and later said it was one of the first horrorcore singles, influencing others. He said he wrote the song because \\"I've always been a fan of horror flicks. Plus the things I see in Harlem are very scary. So I just put it all together in a rhyme.\\" However, he said he preferred other styles over horrorcore. On February 18, 1993, Coleman performed live at the Uptown Lord Finesse Birthday Bash at the 2,000 Club, which included other performances from Fat Joe, Nas, and Diamond D. In 1994, he released his second promotional single \\"Clinic\\". On July 11, 1994, Coleman released the radio edit of \\"Put It On\\", and three months later the video was released. In 1995, the video for the single \\"No Endz, No Skinz\\" debuted, which was directed by Brian Luvar. His debut studio album, Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous, was released in March 1995. The album debuted at number 149 on the Billboard 200 and number 22 on Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. Lifestylez would go on to sell over 200,000 copies as of 2000.

Even though the album received a three-star rating from Allmusic, it was an AMG Album Pick. =1996‚Äì1999: Released from Columbia, second album, independent artist= In 1996, Coleman was dropped from Columbia mainly because of the dispute between Coleman's rapping style and the production from Columbia. He stated, \\"I was there with a bunch of strangers that didn't really know my music.\\" In 1997, he started working on his second studio album, The Big Picture. COC folded when Bloodshed died in a car accident on March 2, 1997. DITC appeared in a July issue On The Go Magazine. Coleman appeared on O.C.'s single \\"Dangerous\\" for O.C.'s second album Jewelz. In November, he was the opening act for O.C.'s European Jewlez Tour. Sometime in 1998, Coleman formed his own independent label, Flamboyant Entertainment. According to The Village Voice, it was \\"planned to distribute the kind of hip-hop that sold without top 40 samples or R & B hooks.\\"Jasper (1999), p. 2 He released the single \\"Ebonics\\" in 1998. The song was based on \\"Ebonics\\", and The Source called it one of the top five independent singles of the year. DITC released their first single, \\"Dignified Soldiers\\", that year. Coleman caught the eye of Damon Dash, the CEO of Roc-A-Fella Records, after the release of \\"Ebonics\\". Dash wanted to sign Lamont to Roc-A-Fella, but Coleman wanted his crew to signHess (2010), p. 41 On February 8, 1999, Coleman, Herb McGruff, C-Town, and Jay-Z started the process to sign with Roc- A-Fella as a group called \\"The Wolfpack\\". Death On February 15, 1999, Big L was killed at 45 West 139th Street in his native Harlem after being shot nine times in the face and chest in a drive-by shooting. Gerard Woodley, one of Big L's childhood friends, was arrested three months later for the crime. \\"It's a good possibility it was retaliation for something Big L's brother did, or Woodley believed he had done,\\" said a spokesperson for the New York City Police Department. However, there are people like rapper Cam'ron who said that Big L had tried help his brother put a hit on Woodley. Woodley was later released due to lack of evidence, and the murder case remains officially unsolved. On June 24, 2016, Woodley was shot in the head and later died at Harlem Hospital. Big L is buried at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.Harlem World Magazine Posthumous releases The tracks \\"Get Yours\\", \\"Way of Life\\", and \\"Shyheim's Manchild\\" b/w \\"Furious Anger\\" were released as singles in 1999 for DITC's self-titled album (2000) on Tommy Boy Records. The album peaked at number 31 on R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums and number 141 on the Billboard 200. Coleman's first posthumous single was \\"Flamboyant\\" b/w \\"On the Mic\\", which was released on May 30, 2000. The single peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs and topped the Hot Rap Tracks, making it Coleman's first and only number-one single. Coleman's second and final studio album, The Big Picture, was released on August 1, 2000, and featured Fat Joe, Tupac Shakur, Guru of Gang Starr, Kool G Rap, and Big Daddy Kane among others. The Big Picture was put together by his manager and partner in Flamboyant Entertainment, Rich King. It contains songs that he had recorded and a cappella recordings that were never used, completed by producers and guest emceess that Coleman respected or had worked with previously. The Big Picture debuted at number 13 on the Billboard 200, number two on Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums, and sold 72,549 copies. The album was certified gold a month later for shipments of 500,000 copies by the RIAA. The Big Picture was the only music by Big L to appear on a music chart outside of the United States, peaking at number 122 on the UK Albums Chart. A compilation album containing COC songs entitled Children of the Corn: The Collector's Edition was released in 2003. The next posthumous album released was 139 & Lenox, which was released on August 31, 2010. It contained previously unreleased and rare tracks. It was released by Rich King on Flamboyant Entertainment. The next album to follow was Return of the Devil's Son (2010), which peaked at number 73 on R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. Coleman's next release was The Danger Zone (2011), and an album called L Corleone was released on February 14, 2012. Legacy and influence Henry Adaso, a music journalist for About.com, called him the twenty-third best MC of 1987 to 2007, claiming \\"[he was] one of the most auspicious storytellers in hip hop history.\\"Adaso, Henry. 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987‚Äì2007). About.com. Retrieved August 27, 2011 HipHopDX called Coleman \\"the most underrated lyricist ever\\". Many tributes have been given to Coleman. The first was by Lord Finesse and the other members of DITC on March 6, 1999 at the Tramps. The Source has done multiple tributes to him: first in July 2000 followed by March 2002. XXL did a tribute to Lamont in March 2003. On February 16, 2005, at SOB's restaurant and nightclub in Manhattan, held a commemoration for him. It included special guests such as DITC, Herb McGruff, and Kid Capri. All the money earned went to his estate. In 2004, Eminem made a tribute to him in his music video for his single \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\". Jay Z stated in an interview with MTV, \\"We were about to sign him right before he passed away. We were about to sign him to Roc-a-Fella. It was a done deal‚Ä¶I think he was very talented‚Ä¶I think he had the ability to write big, and big choruses.\\" Rapper Nas also said on MTV, \\"He scared me to death. When I heard that on tape, I was scared to death. I said, 'Yo, it's no way I can compete if this is what I gotta compete with.'\\" =Style= Coleman is often credited in helping to create the horrorcore genre of hip hop with his 1992 song \\"Devil's Son.\\" However, not all his songs fall into this genre. For example, in the song \\"Street Struck,\\" Coleman discusses the difficulties of growing up in the ghetto and describes the consequences of living a life of crime. Idris Goodwin of The Boston Globe wrote that \\"[Big L had an] impressive command of the English language\\", with his song \\"Ebonics\\" being the best example of this. He was notable for using a rap style called \\"compounding\\". Coleman also used metaphors in his rhymes. M.F. DiBella of Allmusic stated Coleman was \\"a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire\\". On the review of The Big Picture, she adds \\"the Harlem MC as a master of the punch line and a vicious storyteller with a razor blade-under-the-tongue flow.\\" Trent Fitzgerald of Allmusic said \\"a lyrically ferocious MC with raps deadlier than a snakebite and mannerisms cooler than the uptown pimp he claimed to be on records.\\" =Documentary= A documentary Street Struck: The Big L Story was set to be released in 2017. It is directed by a childhood friend and independent film director, Jewlz. Approximately nine hours of footage was brought in, and the film is planned to be 90 to 120 minutes long. The first trailer was released on August 29, 2009. Street Struck contains interviews from his mother Gilda Terry; his brother Donald; childhood friends E-Cash, D.O.C., McGruff, and Stan Spit; artists Mysonne and Doug E. Fresh; producers Showbiz and Premier; and recording DJs Cipha Sounds and Peter Rosenberg. A soundtrack will be made for the documentary, and it will be put together by Lamont's brother Donald.

The instrument consists of a reservoir into which air is blown and then channelled into two reed pipes. It is played with no pauses, as the player employs circular breathing. In street performances, the pungi is used for snake charming. History The pungi is an Indian folk music instrument that is mostly played by cobra charmers in Sindh, Pakistan, and Rajasthan, India. The instrument is made from a gourd. It is also a double-reed instrument. The pungi is played by Jogi in the Thar desert. It was theorized that it was made not just for snake charming, but to make people enter a half- conscious state as part of a religious practice. It is in particular played by snake charmers, mostly in the Terai and Nepal, to arouse snakes to dance. The instrument has a high, thin tone and continuous low humming. It has been an important instrument in Indian folk culture and is known by various names in different parts of India. In northern India, it is known as the been, tumbi, and bansi; in the south, it is known as the magudi, mahudi, pungi, and pambaattikuzhal. http://www.schoolchalao.com/basic-education/show- results/indian-musical-instruments/pungi-or-been Construction The pungi is constructed from a solid coconut cover, to which pieces of bamboo are joined, and has two components: a hollow vessel constructed from a gourd, and double- reed pipes (jivala) with eight to nine holes. The player blows air through the top tube-like portion of the instrument. One pipe makes drone-like sounds. and the other produces the melody. The pipe that produces the melody has seven holes and a range of one octave. The drone pipe only has one hole. Traditionally, both sounds are played simultaneously using circular breathing to create a hypnotic effect. The pungi is usually played solo, as it is difficult to play it with other instruments.https://www.india- instruments.com/windinstrument-details/pungi-snake-charmer-been-shapure- bansi.html = Ban on snake charming = The instrument was often used to entertain the public with snake charming.

In 1903, C. A. W. Schnuse, collecting at Sarampiuni in the foothills of the Bolivian Andes, took 4 specimens, all female, of a fly with a strange broad, flat head. These were described as a new species Eurychoromyia mallea (ŒµœÖœÅœÖœÇ ‚Äî broad; œáŒøœÅŒøœÇ ‚Äî field; ŒºœÖŒπŒ± ‚Äî fly; malleus ‚Äî hammer) by the Austrian entomologist Friedrich Georg Hendel. No specimens have been seen or collected since. Two of the specimens now reside in the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna. The other two specimens are in the Staatliches Museum f√ºr Tierkunde in Dresden. Hendel rated the species as \\"an isolated group of acalyptrate muscids\\". His judgement has been sustained, and they are now recognised as belonging to a distinct family Eurychoromyiidae. No other specimens have ever been identified as belonging to this family. Classification has proved difficult, the absence of any male specimens adding to the difficulties. Following Hennig (1958) they are here tentatively included in the superfamily Lauxanioidea. In 2010 Gaimari & Silva placed then as a subfamily within Lauxaniidae and added further genera, 5 of them new to science. E. mallea is a shiny, peach-brown insect, in length, with a head wide.

Designed as a medium bomber, the Albemarle was used for general and special transport duties, paratroop transport and glider towing. Albemarle squadrons participated in Normandy and the assault on Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. Background Air Ministry Specification B.9/38 required a twin- engine medium bomber of wood and metal construction, that could be built by manufacturers outside the aircraft industry and without using light alloys. The Air Ministry was concerned that if there was a war, the restricted supply of materials might affect construction of bombers. Armstrong Whitworth, Bristol and de Havilland were approached for designs. Bristol proposed two designs - a conventional undercarriage and an wingspan capable of 300 mph and a tricycle undercarriage design with span with a maximum speed of . Both designs, known as the Type 155, used two Bristol Hercules engines. The Armstrong Whitworth AW.41 design used a tricycle undercarriage and was built up of sub-sections to ease manufacture by firms without aircraft construction experience. The AW.41 was designed with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in mind but with Bristol Hercules as an alternative (\\"shadow\\") engine. In June 1938, mock- ups of both the AW.41 and Bristol 155 were examined and new specifications B.17/38 and B.18/38 were drawn up for the respective designs. De Havilland did not submit a design. The specification stipulated at economical cruise while carrying of bombs. Bristol was already busy with other aircraft production and development and stopped work on the 155. Changes in policy made the Air Staff reconsider the Albemarle as principally a reconnaissance aircraft capable of carrying out bombing. Among other effects, this meant more fuel to give a range. An upper dorsal turret and a (retractable) ventral turret for downward firing were added. In October 1938, 200 aircraft were ordered \\"off the drawing board\\" (i.e. without producing a prototype). The aircraft was always expected to be of use as a contingency and to be less than ideal. Design and development The Albemarle was a mid-wing, cantilever monoplane with twin fins and rudders. The fuselage was built in three sections; the structure being unstressed plywood over a steel tube frame.Flight 27 January 1944, p. 89 The forward section used stainless steel tubing to reduce interference with magnetic compasses.Flight 27 January 1944, p. 90. It had a Lockheed hydraulically operated, retractable tricycle undercarriage, the main wheels retracting back into the engine nacelles and the nose wheel retracting backwards into the front fuselage. The two pilots sat side by side with the radio operator behind the pilots and the navigator in the nose forward of the cockpit. The bomb aimer's sighting panel was incorporated into the crew hatch in the underside of the nose. In the rear fuselage were glazed panels for a \\"fire controller\\" to coordinate the turrets against attackers. The dorsal turret was a Boulton-Paul design with four Browning machine guns. A fairing forward of the turret automatically retracted as the turret rotated to fire forwards.Flight 27 January 1944, p. 88. Fuel was in four tanks and additional tanks could be carried in the bomb bay. A notable design feature of the Albemarle was its undercarriage, which included a retractable nose-wheel (in addition to a semi-concealed \\"bumper\\" tail-wheel). It was the first British- built aircraft with this configuration to enter service with the Royal Air Force. The original bomber design required a crew of six including two gunners; one in the four-gun dorsal turret and one in a twin-gun ventral turret but only the first 32 aircraft, the Mk I Series I, were produced like this and they were only used as bombers on two occasions.Williams 1989, p. 37. The Albemarle was considered inferior to other aircraft already in service, such as the Vickers Wellington.Williams 1989, p. 36. Later aircraft were built as transports, called either \\"General Transport\\" (GT) or \\"Special Transport\\" (ST). When used as a paratroop transport, ten fully armed troops could be carried. The paratroopers were provided with a dropping hatch in the rear fuselage and a large loading door in the fuselage side.Bridgman, Leonard. Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II. New York: Crescent Books, 1988. . The production run of 600 Albemarles was assembled by A.W. Hawksley Ltd of Gloucester, a subsidiary of the Gloster Aircraft Company formed to build the Albemarle. Gloster was a part of the Hawker Siddeley group which included Armstrong Whitworth. Individual parts and sub-assemblies for the Albemarle were produced by about 1,000 subcontractors.Tapper 1988, p. 277.\\"British Aircraft of WWII.\\" jaapteeuwen.com. Retrieved: 15 March 2007. Operational History The first Albemarle (P1360) first flew on 20 March 1940 at Hamble Aerodrome, where it was assembled by Air Service Training and was the first of two prototypes built by Armstrong Whitworth.Mason 1994, pp. 335‚Äì337. To improve take-off, a wider span wing was fitted after the eighth aircraft. Plans for using it as a bomber were dropped due to delays in reaching service, it was not an improvement over current medium bombers (such as the Vickers Wellington) and it had obvious shortcomings compared to the four-engined heavy bombers about to enter service but it was considered suitable for general reconnaissance. The Soviet Air Force placed a contract for delivery of 200 Albemarles in October 1942. An RAF unit - No. 305 FTU, at RAF Errol near Dundee - was set up to train Soviet ferry crews.Williams 1989, p. 41. During training, one aircraft was lost with no survivors. The first RAF squadron to operate the Albemarle was No. 295 at RAF Harwell in January 1943. Other squadrons to be equipped with the Albemarle included No. 296, No. 297 and No. 570. The first operational flight was on 9 February 1943, by a 296 Squadron Albemarle which dropped leaflets over Lisieux in Normandy. A Soviet-crewed Albemarle flew from Scotland to Vnukovo airfield, near Moscow, on 3 March 1943, and was followed soon afterwards by eleven more aircraft. Two Albemarles were lost over the North Sea, one to German fighters and the other to unknown causes. Tests of the surviving Albemarles revealed their weaknesses as transports (notably the cramped interior) and numerous technical flaws; in May 1943, the Soviet government suspended deliveries and eventually cancelled them in favour of abundant American Douglas C-47 Skytrains. (The Soviet camp at Errol Field continued until April 1944: apparently the Soviet government hoped to secure de Havilland Mosquitos.) At least two of the Albemarles that reached the USSR were lost in accidents and the surviving aircraft were retired two years later. Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle of No. 296 or 297 Squadron RAF, taking off from Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, with an Airspeed Horsa Mark I in tow. From mid-1943, RAF Albemarles took part in many British airborne operations, beginning with the invasion of Sicily. The pinnacle of the aircraft's career was a series of operations for D-Day, on the night of 5/6 June 1944. 295 and 296 Squadrons sent aircraft to Normandy with the pathfinder force, and 295 Squadron claimed to be the first squadron to drop Allied airborne troops over Normandy. On 6 June 1944, four Albemarle squadrons and the operational training unit sent aircraft during Operation Tonga; 296 Squadron used 19 aircraft to tow Airspeed Horsas; 295 Squadron towed 21 Horsas, although it lost six in transit; 570 Squadron sent 22 aircraft with ten towing gliders; and 42 OTU used four aircraft. For Operation Mallard on 7 June 1944, the squadrons towed 220 Horsas and 30 Hamilcars to Normandy. On 17 September 1944, during Operation Market Garden at Arnhem, 54 Horsas and two Waco Hadrian gliders were towed to the Netherlands by 28 Albemarles of 296 and 297 squadrons; 45 aircraft were sent the following day towing gliders. Of the 602 aircraft delivered, 17 were lost on operations and 81 lost in accidents. The last Royal Air Force unit to operate the type was the Heavy Glider Conversion Unit, which replaced the Albemarles with Handley Page Halifaxes in February 1946 and the type was retired from operational units. Variants Over the course of its production life, a number of variants of the Albemarle were built: * ST Mk I ‚Äì 99 aircraft * GT Mk I ‚Äì 69 * ST Mk II ‚Äì 99 * Mk III ‚Äì One prototype only. * Mk IV ‚Äì One prototype only. * ST Mk V ‚Äì 49 * ST Mk VI ‚Äì 133 * GT Mk VI ‚Äì 117 Most Marks were divided into \\"Series\\" to distinguish differences in equipment. The ST Mk I Series 1 (eight aircraft) had the four gun turret replaced with hand-operated twin-guns under a sliding hood. As a special transport, a loading door was fitted on the starboard side and the rear fuel tank was removed. The 14 ST Mk I Series 2 aircraft were equipped with gear for towing gliders. The Mk II could carry 10 paratroops and the Mk V was the same but for a fuel jettison system. All production Albemarles were powered by a pair of Bristol Hercules XI radial engines. The Mk III and Mk IV Albemarles were development projects for testing different powerplants; the former used the Rolls-Royce Merlin III and the latter used the Wright Double Cyclone.

Born into an illustrious Bengali Muslim family in Midnapore, Suhrawardy was educated at the University of Calcutta and was trained as a barrister in Oxford where he practised at the Gray's Inn in Great Britain. Upon returning to India in 1921, his legislative career started with his election to the Bengal Legislative Assembly on Muslim League's platform but joined the Swaraj Party when he was invited to be elected as the Deputy Mayor of Calcutta under Chittaranjan Das. After Chittaranjan Das's death in 1925, Suhrawardy promoted the Muslim unity on a Muslim League platform, and began advocating for the two-nation theory. After the general elections held in 1934, Suhrawardy pushed for strengthening the Muslim League's political programme and asserted his role as becoming one of the Founding Fathers of Pakistan. After joining the Bengal government in 1937, Suhrawardy assumed the only Muslim League-led government after the general elections held in 1945, and faced criticism from the press for his alleged role in the massive riots that took place in Calcutta in 1946. As the Partition of India loomed in 1947, Suhrawardy championed an alternative to the Partition of Bengal, the idea of an independent united Bengal not federated with either India or Pakistan. This proposal enjoyed some support from Muhammad Ali Jinnah, but ultimately was not adopted. Nonetheless, Suhrawardy worked towards integration of East Bengal into the Federation of Pakistan but parted ways with the Muslim League when he joined hands to establish the Awami League in 1949. During the legislative elections held in 1954, Suhrawardy provided his crucial political support to the United Front that defeated the Muslim League. In 1953, Suhrawardy joined the Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra's Ministry of Talents as a Minister of Law and Justice and served his position until 1955. After supporting the vote of no-confidence motion at the National Assembly that removed Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, the three-party coalition government of Muslim League, Awami League, and the Republican Party, appointed Suhrawardy to the office of Prime Minister, promising to address the issue of economic disparities between the Western Pakistan and the Eastern Pakistan, resolving the energy conservation crises and reforming the nation's military. His foreign policy resulted in increase dependency towards the US foreign aid to the country and pioneering a strategic partnership with the United States against the Soviet Union, and recognised the China by supporting the One-China policy. On the home front, he faced pressure from the business and stock community over his economic policy to distribute the taxation and federal revenues between East Pakistan and West Pakistan, where the controversial issue of national integration had been brought to fruition by the nationalists. After defections from his coalition, and under pressure from President Iskander Mirza, Suhrawardy resigned rather than be dismissed. Early years =Family background and education= Huseyn Suhrawardy was born on 8 September 1892 in Midnapore, Bengal in India into an illustrious Bengali Muslim family known for their wealth, education, and gentry background, who claimed to be the direct descendants of the First Caliph. His father, Justice Sir Zahid Suhrawardy, was a jurist at the Calcutta High Court; and his mother, Khujastha Akhtar Banu, was the daughter of Maulana Ubaidullah Suhrawardy, who was a prolific Urdu language writer and was the first Indian women to have passed the Senior Cambridge examinations. His elder brother, Hasan, a linguist, found a great successful career as a diplomat with Pakistan's Foreign ministry. Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah was his niece. His uncles, Hassan Suhrawardy served in the British Indian Army as a military physician while Sir Abdullah Suhrwardy was a barrister. After his matriculation from the Calcutta Madrassa, Suhrawardy attended St. Xavier's College, where he earned a BSc. In 1913, Suhrawardy attained his MA in Arabic Language and earned a scholarship to attend the Oxford University for his higher studies. His gentry background allowed him to settle in England comfortably while attending the St. Catherine's College of Oxford University, where he attained an MA in political science and graduated with the BCL degree in 1920. After leaving Oxford, Suhrwardy was called to bar at the Gray's Inn where he was trained as barrister-at-Law in 1922‚Äì23. Political career in India =Deputy mayorship of Calcutta and legislation (1922‚Äì1944)= After his training as a Barrister-at-Law in England, Suhrawardy returned to India where he begin his practice at the Calcutta High Court in 1922‚Äì23, building his reputation as a competent lawyer. During this time, he joined the Muslim League and secured his elections as a Member of the Bengal Legislative Assembly. His legislative career took prominence during the times of the Khilafat Movement, a conservative Islamic movement in India, and had remained associate with it for several years. In 1924‚Äì25, Suhrawardy was appointed as deputy mayor of the Calcutta Corporation when he joined the Swaraj Party led by the Mayor of Kolkata Chittaranjan Das. In 1926, he broke with the Swaraj Party after the Hindu-Muslim riots took place in Calcutta, and represented the accused Muslims at the Calcutta High Court, and begin encouraging the trade strikes to maintain pressure on the Congress Party. In 1930s, he strengthened the political programme of the Muslim League, supporting the concept of Pakistan, and begin mobilising his support in favour of the Pakistan Movement. In 1936, he became the Secretary-General of the Muslim League's Bengal chapter and successfully defended his constituency in general elections held in 1934‚Äì37. He was appointed to head the Ministry of Commerce and Labour in 1937 under the provincial administration of Premier of Bengal A. K. Fazlul Huq. He served as Minister of Civil Supplies under Bengal's chief minister, Khawaja Nazimuddin. According to author Thomas Keneally, Suhrawardy blamed black marketers and the central government in New Delhi for the Bengal famine of 1943, and claimed he worked tirelessly on relief. Viceroy Archibald Wavell, however, believed that Suhrawardy was corrupt, that he \\"siphoned money from every project that was undertaken to ease the famine, and awarded to his associates contracts for warehousing, the sale of grain to governments, and transportation.\\" On the other hand, Indian author, Madhushree Mukherjee, laid major responsibility of this famine to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill who wanted the ration for war efforts only and had refrained the U.S. aid to Bengal. Suhrwardy was further accused of practising the Scorched- Earth policy to counter the Japanese Army's advances in East and supervised to burn thousand fishing boats to block any potential movement of invading Japanese Army troops. These measures aggravated starvation and famine and the relief was only ordered when Lord Wavell became the Viceroy, using the Indian Army to organise relief. However, by that time, the winter crop had arrived and famine conditions had already eased, after millions had earlier perished. The Indian press, notably the Hindu press, had become very critical of his role and the Bengali Hindus held him directly responsible for the famine. =Premiership and United Bengal (1946‚Äì47)= Bengal in 1940s: Suhrawardy's proposal of United Bengal eventually failed due to riots in 1946. During the general elections held in 1945 in India, Suhrawardy campaigned against K. Nazimuddin for the Premiership of Bengal, and secured enough political endorsement from the Muslim League that allowed him to form the provincial government as its Prime Minister‚Äì the only Muslim League-led government in India in 1946. The Congress Party had been very critical of his role and the government and limited the number of cabinets departments by dismissing the Hindu members of his cabinet. By 1946‚Äì47, the support for the Pakistan Movement among the Indian Muslims had become very popular and it became inevitable for the creation of the nation-state through the partition of India by 1947. The issue of communalism based on the religious beliefs prevented the inclusion of Hindu-majority districts of Punjab and Bengal in the Federation of Pakistan as the Congress Party and their allies the Hindu Mahasabha sought the division of these provinces on communal lines. To prevent the violence, riots, and long-term border disputes, Suhrawardy joined hands with the demands of preventing the second partition of Bengal by endorsing the idea of independent United Bengal, along with Sarat Chandra Bose, K. Shanker Roy, Abul Hashim, Satya Ranjan Bakshi and F. Q. Choudhri. Suhrawardy reached a compromise with Bose when he sought to form the coalition government between the Congress Party's Bengal section with the Muslim League's Bengal Division. Proponents of the plan urged the Indian public in Bengal to reject the communal divisions and uphold the vision of an independent but united Bengal. In a press conference held in New Delhi on 27 April 1947 Suhrawardy presented his plan for a united and independent Bengal and Abul Hashim issued a similar statement in Calcutta on 29 April. The issue of United Bengal was met with favourable views and backing of Muhammad Ali Jinnah who saw it for the benefits for Bengali Muslims. Jinnah viewed this plan in a long term geostrategic point in believing that independent Bengal led by Muslim premier would forged a closer alliance with Pakistan than it would with India. Despite Jinnah's backing, the plan was fiercely opposed by K. Nazimuddin and Mohammad Akram Khan, who wanted integration with Pakistan. It also was opposed by most Bengali Hindus, who feared being a minority in a United Bengal, and therefore supported the partition of Bengal to keep West Bengal in India. =Direct Action Day (16 August 1946)= Suhrawardy and other Muslim League leaders reportedly delivered provocative speeches reminding the Bengali Muslims of the historical Islamic victory and urged them to follow the same way on 16 August. The historian Devendra Panigrahi, in his book India's Partition: The Story of Imperialism in Retreat, quotes from 13 August 1946 issue of Muslim League mouthpiece The Star of India, \\"Muslims must remember that ... it was in Ramazan that the permission for jehad was granted by Allah. It was in Ramazan that the Battle of Badr, the first open conflict between Islam and Heathenism, was fought and won by 313 Muslims and again it was in Ramazan that 10,000 Muslims under the Holy Prophet conquered Mecca and established the kingdom of Heaven and the commonwealth of Islam in Arabia. The Muslim League is fortunate that it is starting its action in this holy month\\". On 16 August 1946, the massive bloody riots erupted in Calcutta, killings scores of Hindus at the hands of rioters. However, there is no other claim or evidence have been found. Suhrawardy attempted to control the situation by unsuccessfully calling for peace and deployment of the Indian Army in Calcutta with no success. The riots ended with thousand deaths and the Indian press blaming Suhrawardy of obstructing the police work, which is well documented by several authors and eyewitnesses.L/I/1/425. The British Library Archives, London. According to authorities, the riots were instigated by members of the Muslim League and its affiliate Volunteer Corps after listening to the speeches made by Nazimuddin and Suhrawardy, in the city in order to enforce the declaration by the Muslim League that Muslims were to 'suspend all business' to support their demand for an independent Pakistan. However, supporters of the Muslim League believed that the Congress Party was behind the violence in an effort to weaken the fragile Muslim League government in Bengal, further generating the controversy about the real culprits. Historian Joya Chatterji allocates much of the responsibility to Suhrawardy, for setting up the confrontation and failing to stop the rioting, but points out that Hindu leaders were also culpable. A senior intelligence operative wrote to a senior British officer based at Fort William after the 'Great Calcutta Killings' after the Calcutta riots revealing Suhrawardy's villainous nature. He wrote, \\"There is hardly a person in Calcutta who has a good word for Suhrawardy, respectable Muslims included. For years he has been known as \\"The king of the goondas\\" and my own private opinion is that he fully anticipated what was going to happen, and allowed it to work itself up, and probably organised the disturbance with his goonda gangs as this type of individual has to receive compensation every now and again.\\" According to Tathagata Roy, the Governor of Tripura, Suhrawardy had pre-planned the riot long back, evident from the fact that demographic changes were being made in the Calcutta Police constabulary. Even the Bangladeshi historian Harun-or-Rashid, in his book The Foreshadowing of Bangladesh: Bengal Muslim League & Muslim Politics: 1906‚Äì1947, also disclosed the diabolic role of Suhrawardy in orchestrating riots against the Hindus in a pre-planned manner and safeguarding the Muslim goons from the police. Eventually, the United Bengal plan eventually failed which had earlier been facing the opposition of the Muslim League led by K. Nazimuddin, Congress Party, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Communist Party of India. Eventually, the Bengali Hindus voted for the partition that created the West Bengal joining the Union of India, and East Bengal was left with no choice but to join the Federation of Pakistan on 14 August 1947. Public service in Pakistan =Law and health ministries in coalition government (1953‚Äì55)= Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (left) with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 1949. On 14 August 1947, Suhrawardy lost the control of the Bengal Division of the Muslim League and lost the election when K. Nazimuddin was elected for the Chief Minister of East Bengal. After the partition of India, Suhrawardy remained in Calcutta and made calls for peace with Mahatma Gandhi; he returned on 5 March 1949 to Pakistan. After Jinnah's death and K. Nazimuddin becoming the Governor-General in 1948, Suhrawardy was forced out from the Muslim League but the latter co- founded the Awami Muslim League, alongside with the conservative cleric, Maulana Bhasani and others in 1949. He shifted from Muslim unity to greatly espousing the Bengali nationalism, becoming critical of the Government of East Pakistan. In 1950, he begin opposing the conservative agenda of Prime Minister K. Nazimuddin, and forged an alliance with the Communist Party and other left- oriented parties, which was known as the United Front. After the dismissal of Prime Minister K. Nazimuddin in 1953, Suhrawardy joined the Ministry of Talents as a Minister of Law and Justice under Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra, taking responsibility of drafting the Constitution of Pakistan. He also oversaw the implementation of the unification of the West Pakistan as a counterbalance to the East, in a prospect for providing the better governance. During the legislative elections in held in 1954 in East, Suhrawardy led the United Front against the Muslim League led by Nurul Amin, which saw the landslide victory of the United Front. The Awami League forged a three-party alliance with the Muslim League and the Republican Party to form the coalition government in the National Assembly. During this time, he was appointed as Health Minister in the three-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali. During this time, he also acted as Leader of the Opposition, alongside with the I.I. Chudrigar of the Pakistan Muslim League. After Prime Minister Muhammad Ali refused to support the motion to investigation the Muslim League's allegations on Republican Party led by its President Feroze Khan in 1956, Suhrawardy went onto support the vote of no confidence movement by Muslim League against its own Prime Minister. After supporting the successful vote of no confidence movement at the National Assembly, the Awami League successfully held negotiations with the Muslim League and the Republican Party to appoint Suhrawardy as the new Prime Minister. Prime Minister of Pakistan (1956‚Äì57) =Suhrawardy administration: Internal affairs and constitutional reforms= On 12 September 1956, Chief Justice M. Munir, administrated the oath of Prime Minister Huseyn Suhrawardy in Governor's House in Karachi, then-Federal capital of the country. Initially promising to review the policy of One Unit status to the nationalists at the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrwardy backed out to overturn this scheme. At the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrawardy faced politics over two issues pressed by the nationalists: the One Unit and the Electoral College. The issue of One Unit was revived by the nationalists who called for the restoration of the status of the four provinces, beginning to hold massive rallies all around the West. Prime Minister Suhrawardy, however, showed less concern over this issue which came at the interests of the East as he had earlier reached the compromise in favour of being appointed as the Prime Minister. Though, the East had not objected the implementation of the One Unit as they were not above the factional battles motivated by personal interests, the West's multi-ethnic diversity background had effectively raised this issue which had won public support and sympathy. Nonetheless, there were no concrete steps taken by Suhrwardy government to address this issue and it was not until the Yahya administration when it was repealed in 1970. At the National Assembly, the Awami League initiated the constitutional work on reviving the joint electorate system but faced strong pressure and opposition from the Muslim League to implement this issue. The Muslim League had called for the separate electoral system which had subsequent public support over this issue; the East had favoured the joint electorate system. In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrwardy approved to request the three-year extension of army commander General Ayub Khan while approving the appointment of V-Adm. HMS Choudhry as the first native naval commander‚Äì both men served to command their services until 1959. To address the issue of energy conservation in West, Suhrawardy established the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) inviting its chair to Dr.Nazir Ahmad, a physicist. The nuclear power programme was intended to be for peaceful usages when he affirmed his obiligations towards the clauses of the Atoms for Peace initiative. When his Science Advisor, Dr. Salimuzzaman Siddiqui, presented the plan to acquire the NRX reactor from Canada, Suhrawardy reportedly vetoed instead releasing funds for the U.S.-based swimming pool reactor from the United States in 1956. =U.S. aid and the economic policy= In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrawardy halted the National Finance Commission (NFC) programme to allocate taxed revenue equally between East and West Pakistan. Suhrawardy relied heavily upon U.S. aid to the country to meet food shortages, and asked the U.S. President to ship wheat flour and rice on a regular basis to Pakistan. In East Pakistan, there were reports of another widespread famine, in which, wheat, potatoes, and rice were being sent from the U.S. and West Pakistan's Fauji Foundation to East Pakistan on a regular basis. The central government led by Suhrawardy focused on the implementation of the planned economy. His relations with the stock exchange and the business community deteriorated when he announced distribution of the US$10 million ICA aid between West and East, and establishing the shipping corporation at the expense of West Pakistan's revenues. Massive labour strikes broke out in West Pakistan against his economic policy in major cities of Pakistan. Eventually leaders of the stock exchange met with President Mirza to address their concerns and issues. =Foreign policy= 10 July 1957: Prime Minister Suhrawardy meeting with the U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in Washington D.C. when paying a state visit to the United States. Prime Minister Suhrwardy directed the foreign policy towards aligning with the United States against the Soviet Union, and was seen as a pro-American political figure in the country. Suhrawardy harboured strong anti-Soviet views and advocated for strong pro-Western and pro-American policy at the public circles, putting himself at odds with the policy of his own party, the Awami League. He is considered to be one the pioneers of Pakistan's foreign policy aimed, directed, and set towards excessively supporting the United States and their cause, a policy that was pursued by the successive administrations. On 10 July 1957, Prime Minister Suhrawardy paid a state visit to the United States where he met with President Dwight Eisenhower and accepted his request to lease out an air force base to the United States Air Force that would be in use for the signals intelligence purposes against the Soviet Union. The 1960 U-2 incident severely compromised the national security of Pakistan when Soviet Union eventually discovered the base through interrogating its pilot. In return, the United States distributed ~US$ 2.142 billion in shape of giving the supersonic F-104 Starfighter and M48 Patton tanks and dispatching the assistance group to the Pakistan's military. Suhrawardy's party, the Awami League, split over his signing of the US-Pakistan military pact, with Maulana Bhasani leaving to form the National Awami Party (NAP). Prime Minister Suhrawardy was invited by the Soviet Union for an informal visit but he declined. 1956 in China: Prime Minister Suhrawardy signed the alliance pact with Chinese premier Chou-en Lai in Beijing. In 1956, Prime Minister Suhrawardy became the Pakistan's first Prime Minister to paid a state visit to China when he went to meet with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, taking with him the entire diplomatic mission including the Pakistan Ambassador to China, Dr. Ahmed Ali, who had established the Pakistan embassy in Beijing and formed Pak-China friendship and strengthened the official diplomatic friendship between Pakistan and China. In 1957, he well received the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in Karachi when he reciprocated the visit in Karachi. In 1956‚Äì57, Prime Minister Suhrawardy accused India of supporting insurgency in different parts of the country, and levelled accusations against his counterpart, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of undoing the partition of India. =Decline and resignation= His policy inclination towards the United States brought great ire and opposition from within the Awami League, which had been favouring the cleric Maulana Bhasani, who had been suspicious of American motives. Suhrawardy had strongly advocated for Pakistan's membership in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which was aimed towards containing communism; he was in direct conflict with Bhasani on this issue. To the dismay of his party, Suhrawardy became closer to President Iskander Mirza on many issues. There were massive protests carried out in the East against Prime Minister Suhrawardy by the Awami League when the United States dispatched a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to the Pakistani military. Eventually, Bhashani and Yar Mohammad challenged him for the party's presidency, as both men had managed to consolidate the Awami League, but they failed to carry the party mass with them. Intending to break President Mirza's control over Parliament, Suhrawardy asked President Mirza to call a session of the National Assembly and seek a vote of confidence from the Parliament, where Prime Minister Suhrawardy's allies had the majority. His alignment with the United States at the expense of the Soviet Union caused Prime Minister Suhrawardy to eventually lose control over the presidency of the party to the junior leadership under Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish. Threatened with President Mirza's retaliation after the failed parliamentary resolution and facing to have lost the majority in the National Assembly, Prime Minister Suhrawardy faced the similar circumstances as his predecessor and surprisingly tendered his resignation on 17 October 1957. In 1960, he retired from politics, departing for Beirut. Public and personal life In 1920, Suhrawardy was arranged to marry, Begum Niaz Fatimah (d. 1922), the daughter of Justice Sir Abdur Rahim who was also a politician. The marriage produced two children, Ahmed Shahab Suhrawardy and Jahan Suhrawardy‚Äî Ahmed died of pneumonia while studying in London whilst his daughter, Jahan was arranged to marry Shah Ahmed Sulaiman, son of Justice Sir Shah Sulaiman. Begum Niaz Fatima died in 1922. After his passing in 1963, the Suhrawardy family remained active in national politics, and his granddaughter Shahida Jamil subsequently is a politician with the PML(N) and briefly served as the Law Minister in 1999 and 2007. In 1940, Suhrawardy married Vera Alexandrovna Tiscenko, a Russian theatre actress and dancer whom he knew through his older brother, Hasan Shaheed Suhrawardy's work in Russia. Vera converted to Islam by taking the name of Begum Noor Jehan, and took Pakistani citizenship in 1947. She was a Russian actress of Polish descent from the Moscow Art Theatre and protege of Olga Knipper.New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Stanislavski Revisited, Broadcast on WNYC AM NYC, 18 July 1976, LT-10 3099 Suhrawardy and Vera Tiscenko filed for a divorce in Sindh High Court, which was said to be bitter when the Sindh High Court ordered for distribution of Surawardy's wealth with Vera; the divorce was finalised in 1951. Following the divorce, Vera moved to the United States with their only son, Rashid Suhrawardy, (known as Robert Ashby), who is a British actor living in London and briefly portrayed Jawaharlal Nehru in film Jinnah in 1998. =Death= Suhrawardy is buried with other Bengali leaders at a mausoleum in Shahbag, Dhaka. He had been a chronic heart patient and died in Lebanon in 1963 due to a cardiac arrest.

He led the DA from its inception in 2000, until his retirement from leadership in 2007. Before that, he led the Democratic Party from 1994. He is the longest serving leader of the official opposition in parliament since the advent of democracy in 1994. Although still a member of the DA, he served as the South African Ambassador to Argentina under the ANC government from 2009 to 2012. Since 2012, Leon has been serving as Executive Chairman of Resolve Communications (Pty) Ltd - a South African-based advocacy for reputation management and strategic communications consultancy, and a Senior Advisor to K2 Intelligence, a London-NY based international investigative and risk analytics consultancy founded by Jules and Jeremy Kroll in 2009. Leon is also a contracted columnist to Times Media Group Ltd, with his columns appearing weekly or monthly in Business Day, Sunday Times, and the Times. Early life Leon was born and raised in Durban during the apartheid era. He was educated at Clifton Preparatory School and Kearsney College near Durban. His father Ramon Leon was a High Court Judge.Canvassing with a Nat out of Tatler and an assertive DP yuppie Sunday Times. 23 July 1989 Both his parents were active in the liberal, anti-apartheid Progressive Party (which later became the Democratic Party). He is Jewish.http://www.haaretz.com/us- news/jewish-insider-s-daily-kickoff-december-15-2017-1.5628773 Political career In 1974 at the age of 18 he became an organiser for the Progressive Party, one of the two opposition parties represented in parliament at the time. After this, he qualified as an attorney at the University of the Witwatersrand, where he was President of the Law Students' Council and Vice- President of the Students' Representative Council, and became a lecturer in the Law Department in 1986. He has accredited Harry Schwarz and Helen Suzman as his biggest inspirations. In the same year he was elected to the Johannesburg City Council for Yeoville. When the results for the election were released, it was announced that the NP candidate Sam Bloomberg had won. However Harry Schwarz, his political mentor, uncovered that this was untrue, and Leon was declared the winner. He became leader of the opposition in the city council. In 1989 he was elected to Parliament for the Houghton constituency, representing the Progressive Party's successor, the Democratic Party. From 1990 to 1994 he chaired the DP's Bill of Rights Commission, and as such was an advisor to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) and a delegate to the multi-party negotiations that led to the end of apartheid and the establishment of a non-racial democracy in 1994. At the 1994 general elections, Leon was again elected to Parliament in the first democratic National Assembly, as well as leader of the Democratic Party. At the time, the Democratic Party was perceived as merely a minor party of white liberals, an oddity in the first non-racial democratic government of South Africa. Yet between 1994 and 1999 its seven members managed to become the most vocal, active and involved legislators. In 1998, Leon published his first book on the eve of the second democratic election, entitled 'Hope & Fear: Reflections of a Democrat' (Jonathan Ball, 1998). With the second democratic elections in 1999 and the New National Party only retaining 28 seats (down from 82 in 1994), he became Leader of the Opposition as the DP took 38 seats, showing a growth of over five-fold. After the 2004 general elections, the DA under Leon had a vote increased by 2.8%, as did the ANC with an increase of 3.3%. These gains came at a cost to three of the five minor opposition parties, with only the Independent Democrats -- a newcomer in the elections -- also attracting support. Leon built a high media profile as opposition leader by criticising the ANC government under Nelson Mandela but more so under his successor, President Thabo Mbeki. Retirement On 26 November 2006, Leon announced that he would step down from the leadership of the DA in 2007, and would not accept nomination for the leadership of the party at the party's congress in May 2007. Leon, nevertheless, kept his seat in Parliament until 2009, when its term expired. Leon retired as leader of the DA on 5 May 2007. He was succeeded by Helen Zille who was elected as the new party leader on 6 May 2007. One of South Africa's leading political commentator, Justice Malala wrote about him: \\"Every South African should wake up today and say a little thank you to Tony Leon ... he was fearless when many were fearful, vocal when many had lost their voices, openly critical when many would only speak in whispers ... the man has done a remarkable job.\\" ~ Justice Malala, (7 May 2007) Leon was voted 16th in the TV channel SABC3's Top 100 Great South Africans.Great South African list-topper no surprise IOL. 27 September 2004 From September to December 2007, Leon was a Fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard's John F.

Provisional governments are generally appointed, and frequently arise, either during or after civil or foreign wars. Provisional governments maintain power until a new government can be appointed by a regular political process, which is generally an election. They may be involved with defining the legal structure of subsequent regimes, guidelines related to human rights and political freedoms, the structure of the economy, government institutions, and international alignment. Provisional governments differ from caretaker governments, which are responsible for governing within an established parliamentary system and serve as placeholders following a motion of no confidence, or following the dissolution of the ruling coalition. In opinion of Yossi Shain and Juan J. Linz, provisional governments can be classified to four groups:Yossi Shain, Juan J. Linz, \\"Between States: Interim Governments in Democratic Transitions\\", 1995, , p. 5 # Revolutionary provisional governments (when the former regime is overthrown and the power belongs to the ones who have overthrown it). # Power sharing provisional governments (when the power is shared between former regime and the ones who are trying to change it). # Incumbent provisional governments (when the power during transitional period belongs to the former regime). # International provisional governments (when the power during the transitional period belongs to the international community). The establishment of provisional governments is frequently tied to the implementation of transitional justice. Decisions related to transitional justice can determine who is allowed to participate in a provisional government. The early provisional governments were created to prepare for the return of royal rule. Irregularly convened assemblies during the English Revolution, such as Confederate Ireland (1641‚Äì49), were described as \\"provisional\\". The Continental Congress, a convention of delegates from 13 British colonies on the east coast of North America became the provisional government of the United States in 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. The government shed its provisional status in 1781, following ratification of the Articles of Confederation, and continued until it was supplanted by the United States Congress in 1789. The practice of using \\"provisional government\\" as part of a formal name can be traced to Talleyrand's government in France in 1814. In 1843, American pioneers in the Oregon Country, in the Pacific Northwest region of North America established the Provisional Government of Oregon‚Äîas the U.S. federal government had not yet extended its jurisdiction over the region‚Äîwhich existed until March 1849. The numerous provisional governments during the Revolutions of 1848 gave the word its modern meaning: A liberal government established to prepare for elections.

An Atlantis theme haunts the story, as do numerous references to Arthurian mythology, particularly to the mythical country of Lyonesse. Some place names and concepts, such as references to sandestins as magical creatures that do the actual work of carrying out a magician's spells, are shared between Lyonesse and Vance's Dying Earth series, suggesting that the two worlds may be linked. Vance makes no pretence of historical accuracy. The society depicted is in general of the later Middle Ages, with trading cogs plying the seas, knights engaged in jousting and following the fully developed Code of Chivalry, and royal courts dancing the pavane and cotillon ‚Äì all of which would be gross anachronisms when assumed to take place in the 5th century. In this Vance, in fact, followed the conventions of the original Arthurian tales, which depicted the society of their own time rather than that of the historical King Arthur.  Books  The three volumes were published in order of their fictional chronology: *Lyonesse (1983) (subtitled Book I: Suldrun's Garden on the title page) *The Green Pearl (1985) *Madouc (1989)  Plot summary  = Lyonesse (also known as Suldrun's Garden) = The story is told in several interlocking threads which are not always chronological. = The Green Pearl = In a fishing village in South Ulfland, a fisherman catches a flounder and discovers the green pearl inside. The pearl changes hands a number of times, impelling each new owner to strange excesses of conduct, until the final owner offends a minor magician, who takes him deep into the forest and casts a spell of paralysis on him. His body decomposes and merges with the forest floor; in the Spring, beautiful flowers with strangely evocative odors sprout at the site. Aillas and Dhrun divide their time between Watershade, Aillas' placid castle on the island of Troicinet, and his new capital Doun Darric in South Ulfland. Glyneth has been installed at court with the anomalous title \\"Princess\\" and Shimrod is a frequent guest. Aillas journeys to South Ulfland where he attempts to convince the fiercely independent barons to accept his rule as king. He bans private justice and torture and orders the barons to forget their old feuds and unite against the Ska. Aillas' program gains credibility when he sends a force to destroy the mountain keep of the first baron to openly defy him. In Lyonesse, King Casmir plots to destabilize South Ulfland by sending two agents, Sir Shalles and Torqual. Casmir sends Shalles into the Ulfish uplands to sow dissent among the barons through rumor and intrigue. Torqual, a renegade Ska, is ordered to assemble a band of cutthroats to attack those nobles who support Aillas' rule. Torqual has his own plans, to conquer all of the Elder Isles for himself, and Casmir soon grows exasperated with Torqual's demands for ever increasing amounts of gold. Casmir is also troubled by a prophecy made at Suldrun's birth that her son would rule the Elder Isles; Casmir believes Suldrun gave birth to a girl, the princess Madouc. He applies to Tamurello for assistance, who sends to him Visbhume, a low magician of peculiar personal habits. Visbhume makes inquiries and informs Casmir that Suldrun's child was, in fact, a boy and that Madouc is a fairy changeling. Visbhume learns that the boy, known to the fairies as \\"Tippet\\", was travelling with a girl named Glyneth, and that Suldrun's former nursemaid, who had tried to hide Dhrun from Casmir, had left Lyonesse with her entire family and were now landed gentry on Troicinet. The next line of inquiry is obvious. In South Ulfland, Aillas ponders how to test his new army, composed of Troice knights and Troice- trained Ulfish soldiers. The Ska are fearsome in battle but their weakness is their small numbers. Aillas plans a series of hit-and-run raids designed to inflict casualties while avoiding a pitched battle he would almost certainly lose. Aillas sends a force against the lightly defended Castle Sank and succeeds in destroying the garrison and the outer buildings but not the inner citadel. Watching from a distance, Aillas sees a party of Ska approaching Sank on horseback, including the Lady Tatzel. Aillas pursues and captures her, declaring she is now his slave. Since the route back to Doun Darric was likely to be swarming with Ska troops responding to the attack on Castle Sank, Aillas decides to travel north along the high moors into North Ulfland, to arrive at Xounges where he can take a ship home. Along the way they pass Torqual's fortress hideout; Torqual challenges Aillas who defeats him in a duel and leaves him for dead. Tatzel is proud and haughty; her worldview will not accept that she has been made a slave by an \\"otherling\\", as the Ska refer to outsiders. However, she gradually comes to recognize Aillas' intelligence and competence. Aillas, for his part, discovers that the Tatzel of reality is nothing like the Tatzel of his daydreams, and the infatuation is broken. They eventually develop a wary mutual respect. After a series of further adventures, Aillas and Tatzel arrive at Xounges, to find the dying King Gax beset by a Ska delegation headed by Tatzel's father, Duke Luhalcx. The Ska wish King Gax to appoint a Ska successor to his throne, in return for which the Ska promise amnesty for the inhabitants of Xounges. Gax would prefer that his successor drive the Ska out, but the legal heir, Sir Kreim, has already indicated to the Ska that he could be bribed to abdicate, and Gax expects to die a bitter death. Aillas returns his unsatisfactory slave to her father, and in a private audience with King Gax, reveals his identity. In a public ceremony, Gax transfers the crown to Aillas, much to the surprise and consternation of the Ska. Glyneth, at Watershade, ponders her future. She has been playing flirtatious games with Aillas, testing him, but decides that the time for games and testing is over. Before she can act on her decision, she is kidnapped by Visbhume and taken to the alternate world Tanjecterly. Visbhume promises to return her to Earth if she tells him the circumstances of Dhrun's birth, but his obvious designs on her person inform her that she will be killed once he has the information. Glyneth feigns intimacy long enough to strike Visbhume with his own dagger, then runs away into the wilds of Tanjecterly. Aillas and Shimrod are prevented from following Glyneth through the portal into Tanjecterly by Murgen, who understands that this is part of a plot by Casmir and Tamurello to get rid of them, thus weakening Murgen and advancing Casmir's political goals. Murgen instead sends an agent, synthesized from the physical pattern of a fierce beast from Tanjecterly and the guile and cunning of a barbarian pirate named Kul. To give Kul a human soul with love and loyalty for Glyneth, Murgen infuses it with Aillas' blood. In Tanjecterly, Kul catches up with Glyneth and rescues her from Visbhume. Under duress, Visbhume explains that passages to Earth can only be opened at certain times and places, and the next opportunity is many leagues distant. After many adventures they arrive at the portal and Visbhume opens the way, but causes the animal they have been riding to attack Kul, injuring him. Glyneth, though frightened of Kul at first, has grown to love the human spirit within him, and refuses to leave him. Glyneth tells Visbhume the truth about Dhrun's birth, and Visbhume vanishes through the gate. At the Goblin Fair in the forest of Tantrevalles, Melancthe is entranced by four beautiful flowers she has bought, which evoke emotions she can't quite identify. Both Shimrod and Tamurello arrive, prompted by the opening of the interworld portal. Tamurello accosts Visbhume, learns Dhrun's secret, and then turns Visbhume into a snake so that he can not reveal the truth to anyone else. Shimrod and Melancthe peruse the booths at the fair. The flower seller, in search of more, has dug up the green pearl, causing the flowers to die, to Melancthe's great disappointment. He offers her the pearl, but Shimrod dissuades her. Tamurello also sees it and is captivated, but before he can take it, a snake darts out from the forest and swallows it. Tamurello instantly chants a spell and turns into a weasel, pursues the snake into its hole and returns triumphantly with the pearl in his teeth. Murgen, disguised as a peasant, quickly seals the weasel and pearl in a glass jar. The weasel dissolves into a green transparency, like a skeleton in aspic. With no word from Tanjecterly, Aillas resumes his campaign against the Ska. His hit-and-run strategy finally prompts a tactical mistake by the Ska, who divide their forces into two smaller armies. Aillas' Ulfish army attacks and destroys one of these armies. Aillas offers a peace agreement whereby the Ska return to the original limits of their territory; in return Aillas will demand no reparations or hostages. The Ska agree. In Tanjecterly Kul follows the orders implanted in him to return Glyneth to their original starting point, which is the location of the other portal. On the way they are attacked several times so that he loses a great deal of blood, and the beast and pirate aspects of Kul begin to assert themselves. They reach the portal and are besieged by enemies, but Shimrod appears to rescue her. Glyneth will not leave Kul, but Shimrod explains that while Kul is dying, his love for her came from someone else. Shimrod and Glyneth return to Earth where she is reunited with Aillas, now the undisputed King of Troicinet, Dascinet and Ulfland, who reveals his deep love for her (manifested through Kul) and asks her to be his Queen, which she gladly accepts. Aillas, Dhrun, Glyneth and Shimrod journey to Watershade for a banquet, while in Lyonesse, Casmir awaits news from Visbhume that will never come, and ponders the mystery of Suldrun's son. = Madouc = Princess Madouc, unaware of her true parentage, suffers an unhappy childhood comparable to Suldrun's, but has more spunk and actively resists the regimen imposed upon her as a royal princess. On an unauthorized outing into the forest, she is separated from her bodyguard (the stable-hand Pimfet) and discovers her mother, the fairy Twisk, and learns the truth, including the fact that her father's identity is unknown. She meets Prince Dhrun at a reception and shares her knowledge with him, incidentally establishing a mutual but low-key attraction. Meanwhile, Casmir continues to plot against Aillas by funding the exploits of the Ska renegade Torqual, which however have little effect against Aillas's precautions. Allias defeats the Ska residing in a fort on the border with Dahaut and claims the fort itself by law of conquest, causing tensions between the two nations. King Audry is distraught to find his army, though still strong, is slowly growing fat and complacent from mismanagement, and begins trying to re-assert himself as a military power. Shimrod the wizard, at Murgen's request, investigates mysterious demonic attentions in Ys, which appear to involve Melancthe. Murgen is too busy watching over Joald, a trapped being of apocalyptic power, to do so himself. Melancthe continues to fascinate and frustrate Shimrod, and he is unable to learn what her plans are. Later, as part of his service to Murgen, Shimrod disguises himself as a Scythian bravo to infiltrate Torqual's band. He is unable to make progress in his investigation of Melancthe, but disrupts a plot to assassinate King Aillas and kidnap Dhrun. The corpses of the dead assassins are re-animated and march to Casmirs court before expiring in order to send a message. Torqual sets off with Melancthe. Madouc having angered Casmir by refusing to be part of a marriage alliance he's devised, the king punishes her and humors Queen Solace by making Madouc the prize in a quest for the Holy Grail (a relic which would draw pilgrims to the cathedral being built under the instigation of the treacherous Brother Umphred, who has revealed to Casmir that Dhrun is Suldrun's son). Madouc's response is to seek the Grail herself, since that seems the best method of preserving herself. Casmir, distracted by other matters, accidentally gives the royal blessing to the journey. Together with Pimfet, Madouc sets off on a journey for the Grail and for the identity of her father. While she fails to find out who her father truly is even with the help of the Faries and Twisk (as he used a pseudonym while courting Twisk), she does discover what seems to be the Grail. She and Pimfet travel to the castle where the Grail is, and through cunning manage to kill the Ogre Throop and retrieve the Grail, a task that hundreds of knights had tried and failed. Unfortunately, Casmir reneges on his promise. Though his life is spared, Pimfet is still punished harshly despite retrieving the Grail, and Madouc begins to truly hate Casmir with all her being. Madouc then discovers Casmir's plan to frustrate the magic mirror's prophecy that Dhrun would rule the Elder Isles, by having him sit momentarily at the magic table in the capital city of Dahaut and then having Dhrun killed. To this end, Casmir arranges for a colloquy despite having no desire for peace. On the way there, Madouc manages to earn a sliver of respect from Queen Solace when the latter learns of the deeds involved in retrieving the Grail, though the two are still on poor terms. In revenge for his treatment of Pimfet and herself, Madouc foils Casmir's plan by publicly warning Dhrun and the assembled worthies (humiliating Casmir) in the middle of the colloquy. She is stripped of her rank and forbidden from finishing what she had to say, but her message does not fall on deaf ears. Any doubt the worthies had in her statements evaporates when Allias, who had been running late, dramatically arrives and corroborates her story. After King Audry and King Dartweg publicly feud over Celtic bandits, the colloquy is called off. Madouc is then kidnapped by Casmir's agents but rescued by Aillas and Dhrun. Meanwhile, Torqual and Melancthe arrive at Murgen's manse. Desmei manifests out of Melancthe, possesses Torqual, and the Melancthe is left to be brutally killed by Murgen's sentries. Inside, Murgen himself is bound by demonic hands. Desmei orders Torqual to free the Green Pearl so she can be whole, but by accident the Ska instead releases Tamurello. Desmei's physical form is destroyed, and an insane Tamurello tries to free Joald with the help of Torqual simply to spite Murgen, fully aware that it will mean the end of the Elder Isles. Joald manages to partially wrench free, and his presence in the Atlantic causes a massive tsunami that wipes out Ys instantly and the majority of Vale Evander shortly after. Before they can cause the downfall of the entire island however, Tamurello is defeated and Torqual is beheaded. Desmei and Tamurello, unable to be destroyed by normal means since the Green has rendered them partially demonic, are instead sent to an alternate dimension where one of Murgen's associates annihilates them utterly in supernatural fire. The Green is revealed to be a corrupting magical force and an element of a much larger inter dimensional war, which Murgen has been trying to keep from reaching Earth. The deed done, Murgan collapses into a chair, crestfallen. Murgen explains to Shimrod that some of the dead gods of Lyonesse favor Joald, that to kill him would incur their wrath, and thus all that Murgan can do is keep Joald imprisoned for as long as he lives. Casmir, emboldened by the news of the destruction of Vale Evander, throws the dice on a war against Dahaut. He finds that Dahaut puts up much more of a fight than expected. The Ulfs counterattack by raiding the coasts of Lyonesse, and Godelia enters the war on Casmir's side in response. After several battles, the Dahaut army is routed. Prince Cassander is wounded trying to kill the fleeing king Audry. Ignoring the advice of his more experienced advisors and overeager to prove himself, the wounded Cassander orders his scouts to embark on a pointless search that gives the Dahaut army time to regroup and escape. Though King Audry later puts up a valiant fight that allows the majority of his remaining army to escape across the border into the Ulflands, he and his son are killed. Dahaut is conquered, but this triggers an attack on Casmir by Aillas. Cassander is killed during a retreat. The Troice army routs Casmir's army, and Casmir enters the battle only to shortly after flee back towards Lyonesse Town. Casmir discovers to his dismay that Lyonesse Town was captured in his absence. Queen Solace, still in possession of the Grail, was exiled to Europe after the castle fell, and the reader is told she would spend the rest of her days crying over the Holy Grail and her dashed dreams of sainthood. After her death, the Grail is lost again, to be searched for later by King Arthur. After this aside, Casmir is arrested and spends the rest of his days in a cell ruminating over his defeat. Aillas declares himself king of the Elder Isles (with Dhrun as his heir) and brings peace to the realm, also taking the opportunity to have Umphred drowned for his betrayal of Suldrun. Glyneth, now Queen, gives birth to her and Aillas' daughter, Princess Serle. Madouc and Dhrun are in love, and when Twisk is summoned to partake in the celebrations she recognizes Shimrod as \\"Sir Pellinore\\", Madouc's father. All ends happily.  Commentary  One view is that the characterisations of the various kingdoms are decidedly Euro-centric. The Celts of Godelia are fickle and eccentric, the ambitious and aggressive King Casmir is a Germanic despot in all but name, the court of King Audry of Dahaut is a caricature of the decadent excesses of a French monarch and the Ska are transparently cruel Viking raiders. The picture is complete with the Arthurian figure of Prince Aillas hailing from the plucky island race of Troicinet whose sea power is crucial to the story. Aillas' policies are based on the balance of power doctrine, whereby Troicinet seeks to make sure no mainland power would become too strong by supporting the weaker party in any conflict ‚Äì which is clearly reminiscent of the traditional British policy with regard to continental Europe. Also Aillas' later policy, after having become ruler of the entire central island of Hybras ‚Äì to maintain only a limited land army and rely on a strong navy for protection against outside invasion ‚Äì has a distinct British flavor. Indeed, it can be argued that the entire background to the work is a re-working of the Arthurian myths, complete with a great mage (Merlin/Murgen), a Round Table (Cairbra an Meadhan), chivalric codes and a search for the Holy Grail.Review by Nick Gevers, Ph.D., Cape Town, South Africa. However, unlike the awe in which the original Arthurian characters hold the Grail, Vance's attitude is quite cynical. While many objects described in the Trilogy have considerable magical powers, the Grail does not seem to have such; the only use contemplated for the Grail was King Casmir's idea of increasing pilgrimage to his capital and thus the Royal revenues. This did not come true, and in the end the Grail gets taken out of Lyonesse without having made much impression on anybody. The Arthurian hypothesis can perhaps be countered by strong indications that the author has delivered a very conscious melding of various other medieval folkloric and more formal story telling themes, characters and plot devices. The proto Arthurian characters are rather a \\"pre-working\\" of the later romance and still distinct from that tale. Similarly, the Ska, who are equated with the Nemedians of Irish mythology, are repeatedly described as pre-Viking, and indeed having encountered Neanderthals, giving them a far richer presence than \\"cruel Viking raiders\\". Vance builds the history of his world using layers of facts, names and religions taken from various European cultures ‚Äì Greeks, Romans, Celts, pre-Carolingian French and Spanish \\"kingdoms\\" etc., and adding in places and peoples imagined by those same cultures ‚Äì Atlantis, Ys, Avalon, Fomor and so on. This fantastical/factual mix is used to ground his tale in \\"history\\". It also seems to give some of the same depth that a longer series of books might develop where place, relationships and plot are built up over time (as in Thomas Hardy's \\"Wessex\\" or Trollope's \\"Barsetshire\\"). It seems to provide the believability that develops where a story is set in a well-known, well-defined historical setting as if the reader holds merely a hitherto untold story. The combination of a tale that is apparently set in medieval Europe, but which contains significant elements of fantasy and magic, lends itself to use as setting for role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons. =Lands doomed to sink= At the very first paragraph of the first book, Vance informs the reader that the Elder Isles sank under the sea at some later time (which, indeed, readers can know for themselves by glancing at the map of Western Europe and finding no such islands off its shore). The Elder Islands are clearly not Atlantis, which was an ancient myth already in the time of Plato ‚Äì still, the overtones of a land doomed to eventually sink beneath the waves influence the story. All the more so as to the city of Ys, the site of several important events, which has its own Breton myth ending with its being eventually engulfed by the waves. Throughout the series, the characters move though their lives, loves and conflicts, blithely unaware of this total doom hanging over their land ‚Äì all but the wise magician Murgen who, as eventually turns out, is all too well aware of it, and has devoted his life to the effort of averting it. The name \\"Joald\\" is mentioned already in the first part as that of a mysterious being inspiring hush and fear. But only in the end of Madouc is Joald revealed to be a giant underwater being ‚Äì \\"a strange gray creature, human in general configuration, with glistening gray skin, short hairy neck, heavy head with smeared features and the filmy eyes of a dead fish\\" ‚Äì who seeks to destroy the Elder Isles by breaking down the submarine pillars on which they rest. Murgen keeps a simulacrum of Joald tightly bound, and he also devotes much of his time and effort to \\"guard Joald and soothe his monstrous hulk, and ward away whatever might disturb his long wet rest\\". Tamurello, Murgen's rival, in a frenzy of blind hatred and revenge seeks to free Joald, and manages to get the monster's head and right arm free before being stopped by Shimrod ‚Äì enough for Joald to cause a huge tidal wave which destroys Ys, bringing upon this city its foredoomed destruction (though in a manner quite different from that recounted in the original Breton myth). The rest of the Elder Isles are spared, for the time being. However, Joald can only be bound again, not destroyed, as he is under the protection of certain elder gods ‚Äì and thus the Isles' doom is only put off. Commentator David Williams, remarking on a \\"sense of loss\\" evident in much of Jack Vance's writings, notes that \\"Vance exercised this sense of loss in high ironic form in the Lyonesse sequence: all the adventures, all the triumphs and tragedies are futile in an ultimate sense, because the reader knows that, regardless of Murgen's striving, the Elder Isles are doomed to sink into the Atlantic Ocean. All the loves and hates, all the magic will be lost, to be recalled only faintly in myth.\\"David B. Williams, \\"Jack Vance's Lost Worlds and Ancient Futures\\" in Extant 19, March 2007. There is no clear indication of how long it would be after the last book's happy end. Aillas is still a vigorous young king, and by the prophecy which figures so large in the plot he would clearly live out his reign, and his son Dhrun would become king in turn, presumably with Madouc as his queen. It is also mentioned that in later times, fishermen sailing over drowned Ys \\"sometimes glimpsed the wonderful structures of marble, where nothing moved but schools of fish\\"; but there is no clear indication of how many generations of fishermen would have this experience before Joald finally broke loose and the whole land shared Ys' fate.

This is done by assuming that the subcomponents are non-Gaussian signals and that they are statistically independent from each other. ICA is a special case of blind source separation. A common example application is the \\"cocktail party problem\\" of listening in on one person's speech in a noisy room.  Introduction  ICA on four randomly mixed videos Independent component analysis attempts to decompose a multivariate signal into independent non- Gaussian signals. As an example, sound is usually a signal that is composed of the numerical addition, at each time t, of signals from several sources. The question then is whether it is possible to separate these contributing sources from the observed total signal. When the statistical independence assumption is correct, blind ICA separation of a mixed signal gives very good results. It is also used for signals that are not supposed to be generated by mixing for analysis purposes. A simple application of ICA is the \\"cocktail party problem\\", where the underlying speech signals are separated from a sample data consisting of people talking simultaneously in a room. Usually the problem is simplified by assuming no time delays or echoes. Note that a filtered and delayed signal is a copy of a dependent component, and thus the statistical independence assumption is not violated. Mixing weights for constructing the M observed signals from the N components can be placed in an M \\\\times N matrix. An important thing to consider is that if N sources are present, at least N observations (e.g. microphones if the observed signal is audio) are needed to recover the original signals. When there are an equal number of observations and source signals, the mixing matrix is square (M = N). Other cases of underdetermined (M < N) and overdetermined (M > N) have been investigated. That the ICA separation of mixed signals gives very good results is based on two assumptions and three effects of mixing source signals. Two assumptions: #The source signals are independent of each other. #The values in each source signal have non-Gaussian distributions. Three effects of mixing source signals: #Independence: As per assumption 1, the source signals are independent; however, their signal mixtures are not. This is because the signal mixtures share the same source signals. #Normality: According to the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of a sum of independent random variables with finite variance tends towards a Gaussian distribution. Loosely speaking, a sum of two independent random variables usually has a distribution that is closer to Gaussian than any of the two original variables. Here we consider the value of each signal as the random variable. #Complexity: The temporal complexity of any signal mixture is greater than that of its simplest constituent source signal. Those principles contribute to the basic establishment of ICA. If the signals we happen to extract from a set of mixtures are independent like sources signals, and have non-Gaussian histograms or have low complexity like source signals, then they must be source signals.  Defining component independence  ICA finds the independent components (also called factors, latent variables or sources) by maximizing the statistical independence of the estimated components. We may choose one of many ways to define a proxy for independence, and this choice governs the form of the ICA algorithm. The two broadest definitions of independence for ICA are # Minimization of mutual information # Maximization of non-Gaussianity The Minimization-of-Mutual information (MMI) family of ICA algorithms uses measures like Kullback-Leibler Divergence and maximum entropy. The non-Gaussianity family of ICA algorithms, motivated by the central limit theorem, uses kurtosis and negentropy. Typical algorithms for ICA use centering (subtract the mean to create a zero mean signal), whitening (usually with the eigenvalue decomposition), and dimensionality reduction as preprocessing steps in order to simplify and reduce the complexity of the problem for the actual iterative algorithm. Whitening and dimension reduction can be achieved with principal component analysis or singular value decomposition. Whitening ensures that all dimensions are treated equally a priori before the algorithm is run. Well-known algorithms for ICA include infomax, FastICA, JADE, and kernel-independent component analysis, among others. In general, ICA cannot identify the actual number of source signals, a uniquely correct ordering of the source signals, nor the proper scaling (including sign) of the source signals. ICA is important to blind signal separation and has many practical applications. It is closely related to (or even a special case of) the search for a factorial code of the data, i.e., a new vector-valued representation of each data vector such that it gets uniquely encoded by the resulting code vector (loss-free coding), but the code components are statistically independent.  Mathematical definitions  Linear independent component analysis can be divided into noiseless and noisy cases, where noiseless ICA is a special case of noisy ICA. Nonlinear ICA should be considered as a separate case. = General definition = The data are represented by the observed random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m)^T and the hidden components as the random vector \\\\boldsymbol{s}=(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_n)^T. The task is to transform the observed data \\\\boldsymbol{x}, using a linear static transformation \\\\boldsymbol{W} as \\\\boldsymbol{s} = \\\\boldsymbol{W} \\\\boldsymbol{x}, into a vector of maximally independent components \\\\boldsymbol{s} measured by some function F(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_n) of independence. = Generative model =  Linear noiseless ICA  The components x_i of the observed random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_m)^T are generated as a sum of the independent components s_k, k=1,\\\\ldots,n: x_i = a_{i,1} s_1 + \\\\cdots + a_{i,k} s_k + \\\\cdots + a_{i,n} s_n weighted by the mixing weights a_{i,k}. The same generative model can be written in vector form as \\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} s_k \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k, where the observed random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x} is represented by the basis vectors \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k=(\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{1,k},\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{a}_{m,k})^T. The basis vectors \\\\boldsymbol{a}_k form the columns of the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{A}=(\\\\boldsymbol{a}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{a}_n) and the generative formula can be written as \\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\boldsymbol{s}, where \\\\boldsymbol{s}=(s_1,\\\\ldots,s_n)^T. Given the model and realizations (samples) \\\\boldsymbol{x}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\boldsymbol{x}_N of the random vector \\\\boldsymbol{x}, the task is to estimate both the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{A} and the sources \\\\boldsymbol{s}. This is done by adaptively calculating the \\\\boldsymbol{w} vectors and setting up a cost function which either maximizes the non- gaussianity of the calculated s_k = \\\\boldsymbol{w}^T \\\\boldsymbol{x} or minimizes the mutual information. In some cases, a priori knowledge of the probability distributions of the sources can be used in the cost function. The original sources \\\\boldsymbol{s} can be recovered by multiplying the observed signals \\\\boldsymbol{x} with the inverse of the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{W}=\\\\boldsymbol{A}^{-1}, also known as the unmixing matrix. Here it is assumed that the mixing matrix is square (n=m). If the number of basis vectors is greater than the dimensionality of the observed vectors, n>m, the task is overcomplete but is still solvable with the pseudo inverse.  Linear noisy ICA  With the added assumption of zero-mean and uncorrelated Gaussian noise n\\\\sim N(0,\\\\operatorname{diag}(\\\\Sigma)), the ICA model takes the form \\\\boldsymbol{x}=\\\\boldsymbol{A} \\\\boldsymbol{s}+n.  Nonlinear ICA  The mixing of the sources does not need to be linear. Using a nonlinear mixing function f(\\\\cdot\\\\theta) with parameters \\\\theta the nonlinear ICA model is x=f(s\\\\theta)+n. = Identifiability = The independent components are identifiable up to a permutation and scaling of the sources. This identifiability requires that: * At most one of the sources s_k is Gaussian, * The number of observed mixtures, m, must be at least as large as the number of estimated components n: m \\\\ge n. It is equivalent to say that the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{A} must be of full rank for its inverse to exist.  Binary ICA  A special variant of ICA is binary ICA in which both signal sources and monitors are in binary form and observations from monitors are disjunctive mixtures of binary independent sources. The problem was shown to have applications in many domains including medical diagnosis, multi-cluster assignment, network tomography and internet resource management. Let {x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_m} be the set of binary variables from m monitors and {y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n} be the set of binary variables from n sources. Source- monitor connections are represented by the (unknown) mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{G}, where g_{ij} = 1 indicates that signal from the i-th source can be observed by the j-th monitor. The system works as follows: at any time, if a source i is active (y_i=1) and it is connected to the monitor j (g_{ij}=1) then the monitor j will observe some activity (x_j=1). Formally we have: : x_i = \\\\bigvee_{j=1}^n (g_{ij}\\\\wedge y_j), i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, m, where \\\\wedge is Boolean AND and \\\\vee is Boolean OR. Note that noise is not explicitly modelled, rather, can be treated as independent sources. The above problem can be heuristically solved Johan Himbergand Aapo Hyv√§rinen, Independent Component Analysis For Binary Data: An Experimental Study, Proc. Int. Workshop on Independent Component Analysis and Blind Signal Separation (ICA2001), San Diego, California, 2001. by assuming variables are continuous and running FastICA on binary observation data to get the mixing matrix \\\\boldsymbol{G} (real values), then apply round number techniques on \\\\boldsymbol{G} to obtain the binary values. This approach has been shown to produce a highly inaccurate result. Another method is to use dynamic programming: recursively breaking the observation matrix \\\\boldsymbol{X} into its sub-matrices and run the inference algorithm on these sub-matrices. The key observation which leads to this algorithm is the sub-matrix \\\\boldsymbol{X}^0 of \\\\boldsymbol{X} where x_{ij} = 0, \\\\forall j corresponds to the unbiased observation matrix of hidden components that do not have connection to the i-th monitor. Experimental results from Huy Nguyen and Rong Zheng, Binary Independent Component Analysis With or Mixtures, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol. 59, Issue 7. (July 2011), pp. 3168-3181. show that this approach is accurate under moderate noise levels. The Generalized Binary ICA framework introduces a broader problem formulation which does not necessitate any knowledge on the generative model. In other words, this method attempts to decompose a source into its independent components (as much as possible, and without losing any information) with no prior assumption on the way it was generated. Although this problem appears quite complex, it can be accurately solved with a branch and bound search tree algorithm or tightly upper bounded with a single multiplication of a matrix with a vector.  Methods for blind source separation  = Projection pursuit = Signal mixtures tend to have Gaussian probability density functions, and source signals tend to have non-Gaussian probability density functions. Each source signal can be extracted from a set of signal mixtures by taking the inner product of a weight vector and those signal mixtures where this inner product provides an orthogonal projection of the signal mixtures. The remaining challenge is finding such a weight vector. One type of method for doing so is projection pursuit.James V. Stone(2004); \\"Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction\\", The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England; Kruskal, JB. 1969; \\"Toward a practical method which helps uncover the structure of a set of observations by finding the line transformation which optimizes a new \\"index of condensation\\", Pages 427‚Äì440 of: Milton, RC, & Nelder, JA (eds), Statistical computation; New York, Academic Press Projection pursuit seeks one projection at a time such that the extracted signal is as non-Gaussian as possible. This contrasts with ICA, which typically extracts M signals simultaneously from M signal mixtures, which requires estimating a M √ó M unmixing matrix. One practical advantage of projection pursuit over ICA is that fewer than M signals can be extracted if required, where each source signal is extracted from M signal mixtures using an M-element weight vector. We can use kurtosis to recover the multiple source signal by finding the correct weight vectors with the use of projection pursuit. The kurtosis of the probability density function of a signal, for a finite sample, is computed as : K=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{y}})^4]}{(\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{y}-\\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{y}})^2])^2}-3 where \\\\mathbf{\\\\overline{y}} is the sample mean of \\\\mathbf{y}, the extracted signals. The constant 3 ensures that Gaussian signals have zero kurtosis, Super-Gaussian signals have positive kurtosis, and Sub-Gaussian signals have negative kurtosis. The denominator is the variance of \\\\mathbf{y}, and ensures that the measured kurtosis takes account of signal variance. The goal of projection pursuit is to maximize the kurtosis, and make the extracted signal as non-normal as possible. Using kurtosis as a measure of non-normality, we can now examine how the kurtosis of a signal \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{x} extracted from a set of M mixtures \\\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_M)^T varies as the weight vector \\\\mathbf{w} is rotated around the origin. Given our assumption that each source signal \\\\mathbf{s} is super-gaussian we would expect: #the kurtosis of the extracted signal \\\\mathbf{y} to be maximal precisely when \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{s}. #the kurtosis of the extracted signal \\\\mathbf{y} to be maximal when \\\\mathbf{w} is orthogonal to the projected axes S_1 or S_2, because we know the optimal weight vector should be orthogonal to a transformed axis S_1 or S_2. For multiple source mixture signals, we can use kurtosis and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (GSO) to recover the signals. Given M signal mixtures in an M-dimensional space, GSO project these data points onto an (M-1)-dimensional space by using the weight vector. We can guarantee the independence of the extracted signals with the use of GSO. In order to find the correct value of \\\\mathbf{w}, we can use gradient descent method. We first of all whiten the data, and transform \\\\mathbf{x} into a new mixture \\\\mathbf{z}, which has unit variance, and \\\\mathbf{z}=(z_1,z_2,\\\\ldots,z_M)^T. This process can be achieved by applying Singular value decomposition to \\\\mathbf{x}, : \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{U} \\\\mathbf{D} \\\\mathbf{V}^T Rescaling each vector U_i=U_i/\\\\operatorname{E}(U_i^2), and let \\\\mathbf{z} = \\\\mathbf{U}. The signal extracted by a weighted vector \\\\mathbf{w} is \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{z}. If the weight vector w has unit length, that is \\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{z})^2]=1, then the kurtosis can be written as: : K=\\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{y}^4]}{(\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{y}^2])^2}-3=\\\\operatorname{E}[(\\\\mathbf{w}^T \\\\mathbf{z})^4]-3. The updating process for \\\\mathbf{w} is: :\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}=\\\\mathbf{w}_{old}-\\\\eta\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\mathbf{z}(\\\\mathbf{w}_{old}^T \\\\mathbf{z})^3 ]. where \\\\eta is a small constant to guarantee that \\\\mathbf{w} converges to the optimal solution. After each update, we normalize \\\\mathbf{w}_{new}=\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}}{\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}}, and set \\\\mathbf{w}_{old}=\\\\mathbf{w}_{new}, and repeat the updating process until convergence. We can also use another algorithm to update the weight vector \\\\mathbf{w}. Another approach is using negentropy instead of kurtosis. Using negentropy is a more robust method than kurtosis, as kurtosis is very sensitive to outliers. The negentropy methods are based on an important property of Gaussian distribution: a Gaussian variable has the largest entropy among all continuous random variables of equal variance. This is also the reason why we want to find the most nongaussian variables. A simple proof can be found in Differential entropy. :J(x) = S(y) - S(x)\\\\, y is a Gaussian random variable of the same covariance matrix as x :S(x) = - \\\\int p_x(u) \\\\log p_x(u) du An approximation for negentropy is :J(x)=\\\\frac{1}{12}(E(x^3))^2 + \\\\frac{1}{48}(kurt(x))^2 A proof can be found in the original papers of Comon; it has been reproduced in the book Independent Component Analysis by Aapo Hyv√§rinen, Juha Karhunen, and Erkki Oja This approximation also suffers from the same problem as kurtosis (sensitivity to outliers). Other approaches have been developed. :J(y) = k_1(E(G_1(y)))^2 + k_2(E(G_2(y)) - E(G_2(v))^2 A choice of G_1 and G_2 are :G_1 = \\\\frac{1}{a_1}\\\\log(\\\\cosh(a_1u)) and G_2 = -\\\\exp(-\\\\frac{u^2}{2}) = Based on infomax = Infomax ICABell, A. J.; Sejnowski, T. J. (1995). \\"An Information-Maximization Approach to Blind Separation and Blind Deconvolution\\", Neural Computation, 7, 1129-1159 is essentially a multivariate, parallel version of projection pursuit. Whereas projection pursuit extracts a series of signals one at a time from a set of M signal mixtures, ICA extracts M signals in parallel. This tends to make ICA more robust than projection pursuit.James V. Stone (2004). \\"Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction\\", The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England; The projection pursuit method uses Gram- Schmidt orthogonalization to ensure the independence of the extracted signal, while ICA use infomax and maximum likelihood estimate to ensure the independence of the extracted signal. The Non-Normality of the extracted signal is achieved by assigning an appropriate model, or prior, for the signal. The process of ICA based on infomax in short is: given a set of signal mixtures \\\\mathbf{x} and a set of identical independent model cumulative distribution functions(cdfs) g, we seek the unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W} which maximizes the joint entropy of the signals \\\\mathbf{Y}=g(\\\\mathbf{y}), where \\\\mathbf{y}=\\\\mathbf{Wx} are the signals extracted by \\\\mathbf{W}. Given the optimal \\\\mathbf{W}, the signals \\\\mathbf{Y} have maximum entropy and are therefore independent, which ensures that the extracted signals \\\\mathbf{y}=g^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{Y}) are also independent. g is an invertible function, and is the signal model. Note that if the source signal model probability density function p_s matches the probability density function of the extracted signal p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}, then maximizing the joint entropy of Y also maximizes the amount of mutual information between \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{Y}. For this reason, using entropy to extract independent signals is known as infomax. Consider the entropy of the vector variable \\\\mathbf{Y}=g(\\\\mathbf{y}), where \\\\mathbf{y}=\\\\mathbf{Wx} is the set of signals extracted by the unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W}. For a finite set of values sampled from a distribution with pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}, the entropy of \\\\mathbf{Y} can be estimated as: : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}}(\\\\mathbf{Y}^t) The joint pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}} can be shown to be related to the joint pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{y}} of the extracted signals by the multivariate form: : p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}}(Y)=\\\\frac{p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{Y}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{y}}} where \\\\mathbf{J}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{Y}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{y}} is the Jacobian matrix. We have \\\\mathbf{J}=g'(\\\\mathbf{y}), and g' is the pdf assumed for source signals g'=p_s, therefore, : p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}}(Y)=\\\\frac{p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{Y}}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{y}}}=\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y})} therefore, : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{y})}{p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y})} We know that when p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}=p_s, p_{\\\\mathbf{Y}} is of uniform distribution, and H({\\\\mathbf{Y}}) is maximized. Since : p_{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{y})=\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{y}}{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{x}}}=\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\mathbf{W}} where \\\\mathbf{W} is the absolute value of the determinant of the unmixing matix \\\\mathbf{W}. Therefore, : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln\\\\frac{p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x}^t)}{\\\\mathbf{W}p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y}^t)} so, : H(\\\\mathbf{Y})=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y}^t)+\\\\ln\\\\mathbf{W}+H(\\\\mathbf{x}) since H(\\\\mathbf{x})=-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N\\\\ln p_\\\\mathbf{x}(\\\\mathbf{x}^t), and maximizing \\\\mathbf{W} does not affect H_{\\\\mathbf{x}}, so we can maximize the function : h(\\\\mathbf{Y})=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln p_\\\\mathbf{s}(\\\\mathbf{y}^t)+\\\\ln\\\\mathbf{W} to achieve the independence of extracted signal. If there are M marginal pdfs of the model joint pdf p_{\\\\mathbf{s}} are independent and use the commonly super-gaussian model pdf for the source signals p_{\\\\mathbf{s}}=(1-\\\\tanh(\\\\mathbf{s})^2), then we have : h(\\\\mathbf{Y})=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i=1}^M\\\\sum_{t=1}^N \\\\ln (1-\\\\tanh(\\\\mathbf{w_i^T x^t})^2)+\\\\ln\\\\mathbf{W} In the sum, given an observed signal mixture \\\\mathbf{x}, the corresponding set of extracted signals \\\\mathbf{y} and source signal model p_{\\\\mathbf{s}}=g', we can find the optimal unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W}, and make the extracted signals independent and non-gaussian. Like the projection pursuit situation, we can use gradient descent method to find the optimal solution of the unmixing matrix. = Based on maximum likelihood estimation = Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a standard statistical tool for finding parameter values (e.g. the unmixing matrix \\\\mathbf{W}) that provide the best fit of some data (e.g., the extracted signals y) to a given a model (e.g., the assumed joint probability density function (pdf) p_s of source signals). The ML \\"model\\" includes a specification of a pdf, which in this case is the pdf p_s of the unknown source signals s. Using ML ICA, the objective is to find an unmixing matrix that yields extracted signals y = \\\\mathbf{W}x with a joint pdf as similar as possible to the joint pdf p_s of the unknown source signals s. MLE is thus based on the assumption that if the model pdf p_s and the model parameters \\\\mathbf{A} are correct then a high probability should be obtained for the data x that were actually observed. Conversely, if \\\\mathbf{A} is far from the correct parameter values then a low probability of the observed data would be expected. Using MLE, we call the probability of the observed data for a given set of model parameter values (e.g., a pdf p_s and a matrix \\\\mathbf{A}) the likelihood of the model parameter values given the observed data. We define a likelihood function \\\\mathbf{L(W)} of \\\\mathbf{W}: \\\\mathbf{ L(W)} = p_s (\\\\mathbf{W}x)\\\\det \\\\mathbf{W}. This equals to the probability density at x, since s = \\\\mathbf{W}x. Thus, if we wish to find a \\\\mathbf{W} that is most likely to have generated the observed mixtures x from the unknown source signals s with pdf p_s then we need only find that \\\\mathbf{W} which maximizes the likelihood \\\\mathbf{L(W)}. The unmixing matrix that maximizes equation is known as the MLE of the optimal unmixing matrix. It is common practice to use the log likelihood, because this is easier to evaluate. As the logarithm is a monotonic function, the \\\\mathbf{W} that maximizes the function \\\\mathbf{L(W)} also maximizes its logarithm \\\\ln \\\\mathbf{L(W)}. This allows us to take the logarithm of equation above, which yields the log likelihood function \\\\ln \\\\mathbf{L(W)} =\\\\sum_{i}\\\\sum_{t} \\\\ln p_s(w^T_ix_t) + N\\\\ln\\\\det \\\\mathbf{W} If we substitute a commonly used high-Kurtosis model pdf for the source signals p_s = (1-\\\\tanh(s)^2) then we have \\\\ln \\\\mathbf{L(W)} ={1 \\\\over N}\\\\sum_{i}^{M} \\\\sum_{t}^{N}\\\\ln(1-\\\\tanh(w^T_i x_t )^2) + \\\\ln \\\\det \\\\mathbf{W} This matrix \\\\mathbf{W} that maximizes this function is the maximum likelihood estimation.

There are many algorithms available in the literature which do ICA. A largely used one, including in industrial applications, is the FastICA algorithm, developed by Hyv√§rinen and Oja, which uses the kurtosis as cost function. Other examples are rather related to blind source separation where a more general approach is used. For example, one can drop the independence assumption and separate mutually correlated signals, thus, statistically \\"dependent\\" signals. Sepp Hochreiter and J√ºrgen Schmidhuber showed how to obtain non-linear ICA or source separation as a by-product of regularization (1999). Their method does not require a priori knowledge about the number of independent sources.  Applications  ICA can be extended to analyze non- physical signals. For instance, ICA has been applied to discover discussion topics on a bag of news list archives. Some ICA applications are listed below: Independent component analysis in EEGLAB * optical Imaging of neurons * neuronal spike sorting * face recognition * modelling receptive fields of primary visual neurons * predicting stock market prices * mobile phone communications * colour based detection of the ripeness of tomatoes * removing artifacts, such as eye blinks, from EEG data. * analysis of changes in gene expression over time in single cell RNA-sequencing experiments. * studies of the resting state network of the brain.

Though it is often marketed as Volksmusik, it differs from traditional folk music in that it is commercially performed by celebrity singers and concentrates on newly created sentimental and cheerful feel-good compositions. Volkst√ºmliche Musik is sometimes instrumental, but usually presented by one or especially two singers and is most popular amongst an adult audience in (Germany), Austria, Switzerland, and also in South Tyrol (Italy), Alsace-Moselle (France), Netherlands, Flanders (Belgium), Slovenia, Silesia (Poland) and northern Croatia. Characteristics Closely related to the German schlager genre, many titles stress a Heimat affect, being presented in regional dialects (e.g. Bavarian, Upper Saxon, Low German or Rhinelandic) or colloquial language and invoke local and regional lifestyles and traditions, particularly dances. Brass and Alpine musical instruments, such as Alphorns, Zithers, acoustic guitars, violas, and harmonicas are frequently featured, although most commercial productions nowadays employ drum machines and synthesizers. Yodeling is also common. History From the early 1960s onwards, Volkst√ºmliche Musik was conceived for commercial reasons as a counterweight to youth-oriented rock and pop music. The adjective volkst√ºmlich refers to the borrowing of German folklore elements, connecting them to virtually all kinds of light dance and popular music of the 19th and early 20th centuries, from waltz to swing music. The large popularity of this music genre led to the development of volkst√ºmliche record charts and various radio and television broadcasts with popular presenters like Carolin Reiber or Maria Hellwig. Volkst√ºmliche Musik was influenced by Flower Power songs as well as by popular classical pieces during the 1970s and has been increasingly mingled with schlager music, promoted by successful singers like Heino serving as a model for performers like Die Flippers, Andy Borg or Kristina Bach. Its diffusion was further boosted by comprehensive TV broadcasting with some of the most popular programmes including Musikantenstadl (since 1981), Grand Prix der Volksmusik (1986‚Äì2010) and Lustige Musikanten with Marianne & Michael. Beside Volkst√ºmliche Musik, these telecasts also feature big bands, country and even samba music. Reception Modelled on immensely popular Musikantenstadl, since the early 1990s Volkst√ºmliche Musik features strongly in numerous peak-time television broadcasts on German, Austrian and Swiss public TV networks including ARD, ZDF, ORF and Schweizer Fernsehen as well as several regional TV networks and local radio stations. Commercial broadcasters nowadays tend to stay clear of it because it is not very popular with the commercially desirable younger target groups up to 49 years of age, however, there are several cable and satellite television stations focusing on the genre. Not unlike schlager, Volkst√ºmliche Musik is often belittled by younger or more sophisticated audiences as a massively commercialized product created for the lower strata of society, conveying idyllic, reactionary, irrational ideas. Those holding these views sometimes sarcastically deride the expression \\"volkst√ºmliche Musik\\" (folksy/folk-like music) by replacing the \\"-t√ºmlich\\"(-like)-suffix by \\"-d√ºmmlich\\", meaning roughly \\"featherbrained\\", turning it into \\"folk-featherbrained Music\\", e.g. dim-witted, daft or dopey. Sociological surveys confirm a predominant conservative attitude among the target population, who often feel that Volkst√ºmliche Musik performances provide a means of stress alleviation and escapism. In this perception, Volkst√ºmliche Musik differs somewhat from its ancestor, the traditional folk (Volksmusik), which continues to be performed by many local groups and orchestras in different areas. The Volkst√ºmliche Musik market is the largest section of the music business in German-speaking areas. Due to the advanced age of the main target group, copyright infringement has not been prevalent so far. =United Kingdom= Though the term is mainly unknown in the United Kingdom, volkst√ºmliche Musik has attracted a fanbase there including BBC Radio Manchester commentator, Ian Cheeseman. A number of British singers have also been attracted to this style of music, even featuring on Musikantenstadl, such as Ross Antony,http://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/ross-antony- shropshire-lad-gives-german.html Tony Christiehttp://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/tony-christie-from-uk- big-voice-to.html and Roger Whittaker.http://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/roger-whittaker- schlager-star-from-uk.html See also *Music of Germany *Austrian folk dancing  References  External links *Radio Heimatmelodie ‚Äì a radio format specialized on German Volksmusik and \\"volkst√ºmlicher Schlager\\" *Radio VHR ‚Äì one major source of German Volksmusik and Schlager (online-stream) *Radio Herz: Radio station from Toronto playing Volksmusik 24 hours a day via the internet * Schlager/Volksmusik ‚Äì various online-streams *Volksmusik.TV: Schlager, volkstuemliche,- and Volksmusik available via Cable, Satellite and IPTV German folk music German words and phrases ","title":"Volkst√ºmliche Musik"},{"id":"598058","text":"GCSE is the initialism of General Certificate of Secondary Education.

The Crown was bound to the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (sometimes the Sacra Corona meant the Land, the Carpathian Basin, but it also meant the coronation body, too). No king of Hungary was regarded as having been truly legitimate without being crowned with it. In the history of Hungary, more than fifty kings were crowned with it, up to the last, Charles IV, in 1916. The only kings who were not so crowned were Wladyslaw I, John Z√°polya, John Sigismund Z√°polya and Joseph II. The enamels on the crown are mainly or entirely Byzantine work, presumed to have been made in Constantinople in the 1070s. The crown was presented by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas to King G√©za I of Hungary; both are depicted and named in Greek on enamel plaques in the lower crown. It is one of the two known Byzantine crowns to survive, the other being the slightly earlier Monomachus Crown, which is also in Budapest, in the Hungarian National Museum.Beckwith, 214B√†r√†ny-Oberschall (1949) However, the Monomachus Crown may have had another function, and the Holy Crown has probably been remodelled, and uses elements of different origins. The date assigned to the present configuration of the Holy Crown varies, but is most commonly put around the late 12th century.L√°szl√≥, 425 The Hungarian coronation insignia consists of the Holy Crown, the sceptre, the orb, and the mantle. The orb has the coat-of-arms of Charles I of Hungary (1310‚Äì1342). In popular tradition the Holy Crown was thought to be older, dating to the time of the first King Stephen I of Hungary, crowned in 1000/1001. It was first called the Holy Crown in 1256. During the 14th century, royal power came to be represented not simply by a crown, but by just one specific object: the Holy Crown. This also meant that the Kingdom of Hungary was a special state: they were not looking for a crown to inaugurate a king, but rather, they were looking for a king for the crown; as written by Crown Guard P√©ter R√©vay. He also depicts that \\"the Holy Crown is for the Hungarians what the Lost Ark is for the Jewish people\\".\\"De sacra corona regni Hungariae ortu, virtuti, victoria, fortuna... brevis commentarius, 1613. Since 2000, the Holy Crown has been on display in the central Domed Hall of the Hungarian Parliament Building.  Specifications  * The Crown's shape is elliptic (the width is 203.9 mm, the length is 215.9 mm) and is larger than a (healthy) human head. During coronations, the king had to wear a leather 'kapa' liner, made to fit, inside the crown. * The weight of the Crown is 2056 g. (4 lb 8.52 oz) * The gold-silver alloys in the upper and the lower parts of the Crown differ in alloy ratio. * The lower part of the Crown is asymmetric.N√©meth Zsolt: A magyar Szent Korona, BKL Kiad√≥, 2007.  Holiness doctrine  As is the case with all European Christian crowns, it symbolizes a halo and thus signifies that the wearer rules by Divine Right. According to popular tradition, St Stephen I held up the crown before his death (in the year 1038) to offer it to the Virgin Mary to seal a divine contract between her and the divine crown. After this, Mary was depicted not only as patrona (patron saint) for the Kingdom of Hungary but also as regina (i.e. \\"queen\\"). This contract was supposed to empower the crown with divine force to help the future kings of Hungary and did help reinforce the political system based on the so-called \\"Doctrine of the Holy Crown\\" (). P√©ter R√©vay, a Crown Guard, expounded this doctrine in his works Commentarius De Sacra Regni Hungariae Corona (Explanation of the Holy Crown of the Kingdom of Hungary, published in Augsburg, 1613) and De monarchia et Sacra Corona Regni Hungariae (About the Monarchy and the Holy Crown of Hungary, Frankfurt, 1659). At the core of this doctrine was the notion that the crown itself had personhood and as a legal entity is identical to the state of Hungary. It is superior to the ruling monarch, who rules \\"in the name of the crown\\". Origin The crown depicted in the 15th-century Fugger Chronicle. All images of the crown before the mid-17th century show the cross in its original upright position. Holy Crown of Hungary, 1857 Engraving from 1613 Matthias II of Hungary on a coin with the Holy Crown According to the most accepted theory, which is represented in the publications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and also of the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference,Zombori, I, Cs√©falvay, P., Maria Antonietta De Angelis: A Thousand Years of Christianity in Hungary ‚Äì Hungariae Christianae Millennium ‚Äì Published by the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference, Budapest, 2001, for the exhibition in the Musea of Vatican, Vatican City, 10 October 2001 ‚Äì 12 January 2002 ‚Äì under the auspices of Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n the Holy Crown of Hungary consists of two main parts: \\"abroncs\\" (rim, hoop) the corona graeca, and \\"keresztp√°ntok\\" (cross straps) the corona latina. It was created during the reign of B√©la III under Byzantine influence. (The Hungarian king B√©la III was brought up in the Byzantine court and was for a period the official heir to the throne there.) The crowning of Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, who was later canonized Saint Stephen, marks the beginning of Hungarian statehood. The date is variously given as Christmas 1000 or 1 January 1001. One version of the origin of the crown is written by bishop Hartvik (between 1095‚Äì1116), in which the \\"Pope\\" has sent King Stephen I \\"his blessings and a crown\\". The basis for this belief is a biography by bishop Hartvik written around 1100‚Äì1110 at the request of King K√∂nyves K√°lm√°n. According to \\"Hartvik‚Äôs legend\\", St Stephen sent Archbishop Astrik of Esztergom to Rome to ask for or require (both are possible from original Latin script) a crown from the \\"Pope\\", but it does not tell the name of the Pope. No matter how much Astrik hurried, the Polish prince, Mieszko I's envoy was quicker, and the crown was prepared for the future Polish king. The Pope had seen a dream during the night, seeing the angel of the Lord telling him there will be another envoy from another nation, asking for a crown for their own king. The angel told the Pope: \\"There will be another envoy from an unknown folk, who will ask for [or require] a crown, too, please give the crown to them, as they deserve it\\". The next day Astrik approached the Pope so he gave the crown to him. \\"Hartvik‚Äôs legend\\" appeared in the liturgical books and breviaries in Hungary around 1200, recalling the then-existing Pope, Pope Sylvester II. Consequently, the story of how the crown had been sent by Pope Sylvester II spread throughout the Christian world, so in 1613, crown guard P√©ter R√©vay states that the entire crown was given to St Stephen by Pope Sylvester II. However, this legend can be considered a myth, as Mieszko I was not living at the same time as either St. Stephen I or Pope Sylvester II. Also, in the \\"Greater Legend\\" of St Stephen, written around the time he was canonised (1083), we learn only that \\"in the fifth year after the death of his father (...) they brought a Papal letter of blessings (...) and the Lord‚Äôs favoured one, Stephen, was chosen to be king, and was anointed with oil and fortunately crowned with the diadem of royal honour\\". This legend clearly lacks the information that the crown was from Rome. Moreover, there are no documents found in Vatican City on the granting of the crown, even though the Vatican has a clear interest in handing over the crown from Rome, as it is representing dominance over the Kingdom of Hungary. There is another version on the origin of Holy Crown, which is a popular fallacy: Thietmar von Merseburg (died in 1018) reports that Otto III of the Holy Roman Empire has consented to the coronation of St. Stephen, and the Pope is sending his blessings; so many historians argued he has also sent a crown, however, does not report on any crown, so it cannot follow any fact. Beside the two main theories ‚Äì donation by the pope and creation in the time of B√©la III ‚Äì there exist a number of different theories of the more romantic kind, putting the origin of the crown into the far past and into Asia. The question to what extent the upper part of the Holy Crown indeed belonged to the crown of King Stephen I remained open until 1978, when the coronation insignia was returned to Hungary and a thorough examination could be carried out. The differing styles and techniques used in making the enamel pictures and the fact that the inscriptions on the diadem are in Greek and on the bands in Latin suggest that the two parts were probably made in two different periods. However, we have to note that there are no known representations of any kind in which the crown is separated: the Holy Crown is always shown as one. Type The Crown is a coronation crown, which should be worn only on the occasion of a coronation, and for the rest of the time two crown guards (korona≈ër) guard it. Apart from this, there are only two other people who can touch it, the n√°dorisp√°n (the highest secular title), who puts it onto a pillow during the coronation, and the Archbishop of Esztergom (primate of Hungary, the highest ecclesiastical title), who places it on the head of the king. Structure of the crown and its icons Sketch of the enamel icons of the Saints on the Holy Crown (top view, the crown's front side is on the bottom of the image) The Holy Crown was made of gold and decorated with nineteen enamel \\"pantokrator\\" picture (pantokrator is a Greek word meaning \\"the master of the universe\\") as well as semi-precious stones, genuine pearls, and almandine. It has three parts: \\"abroncs\\" (rim, hoop) (corona graeca), \\"keresztp√°ntok\\" (cross straps) (corona latina), and the cross on the top, which is today crooked. There are four hanging pendants (pendilia) dangling from chains on each side of the diadem and one in the back. There is no monde. =Corona graeca= The \\"abroncs\\" (rim, hoop) corona graeca (\\"Greek Crown\\") is 5.2 cm wide with a diameter of 20.5 cm. The two aquamarine stones with cut surfaces on the back of the diadem were added as replacements by King Matthias II (1608‚Äì1619). The enamel picture on the front depicts Christ Pantokrator. On the rim to the right and left of Jesus are pictures of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, followed by half-length images of the Saints George and Demetrius, and Cosmas and Damian. Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas on the corona graeca of the Holy Crown of Hungary G√©za I on the corona graeca of the Holy Crown of Hungary In the arched frame on the back of the diadem Emperor Michael VII Doukas (1071‚Äì1078) is depicted. Below it to the left is the half- length picture of \\"Kon. Porphyrogennetos\\", this probably being either Emperor Michael's brother and co-emperor Konstantios Doukas or of his son and heir Constantine Doukas, both having been born in the purple. To the right there is a picture of the Hungarian King G√©za I (1074‚Äì1077), with the Greek inscription: \\"ŒìŒïŒ©ŒíŒôŒ§ŒñŒëœπ Œ†ŒôŒ£Œ§Œüœπ ŒöŒ°ŒëŒõŒóœπ Œ§ŒüŒ•Œ°ŒöŒôŒëœπ\\" (Ge≈çbitzas pist√≥s kr√°lƒìs Tourk√≠as, meaning \\"G√©za I, faithful kralj of the land of the Turks\\"). According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, writing in his De Administrando Imperio (ca. 950 AD) \\"Patzinakia, the Pecheneg realm, stretches west as far as the Siret River (or even the Eastern Carpathian Mountains), and is four days distant from Tourkia (i.e. Hungary).\\" The contemporary Byzantine name for the Hungarians was \\"Turks\\", while the Hungarian branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, under Constantinople's jurisdiction, was named the \\"Metropolitanate of Tourkia\\" (Hungary), and the head of this church was the \\"Metropolitan of Tourkia\\" (Hungary). As was customary in the hierarchy of the Byzantine state, clear differentiation is made between style of the emperors and that of the Hungarian king by using a hellenized form of the common South Slavic word for \\"king\\" (Kralj) for G√©za. The saints and the Greek rulers have halos while G√©za does not. The inscriptions of the emperors‚Äô names are in red, while the Hungarian king's is in dark blue or black. The enamel plaques on the circular band, the panel depicting Christ Pantokrator, and the picture of Emperor Michael were all affixed to the crown using different techniques. The picture of the emperor could not be attached to the rim in the same way as the Pantokrator picture on the front. The frame was folded upwards and the picture of the emperor was nailed to the edge. We can thus conclude that the picture of Michael VII was not originally designed for this crown, but was probably used first somewhere else. The corona graeca with its pointed and arched plaques is identical to the form of the crowns of the Byzantine empresses ‚Äì in other words it was a woman's crown. It was given by Emperor Michael Dukas VII to King G√©za's wife, known only as Synadene, around 1075. The gift was not a new crown, but rather an old crown designed for a woman that had to be selected from the Emperor's treasury and remodelled. The enamel pictures that become outdated were removed, since either represented earlier historical figures or were not appropriate for the Hungarian queen according to court protocol. It was in this form that the crown was sent to Hungary. There is another view that the G√©za depicted on the corona graeca is not King G√©za I but St Stephen's father.A. Gallus, \\"The structural aspect: towards a plural society\\", Quest for a new Central Europe, ed. J. Vars√°nyi, 1976, pp. 130-176, at p. 147 This view is confirmed by the fact that Grand Prince G√©za is depicted on the corona gracea without a crown, although carrying a royal sceptre. Anthony Endrey, The Holy Crown of Hungary, Hungarian Institute, 1978, pp. 13-115 =Corona Latina= The \\"keresztp√°ntok\\" (cross straps) corona latina (\\"Latin Crown\\") is made of four 5.2-cm-wide gold strips welded to the edge of a square central panel (7.2*7.2 cm); the strips are usually assumed to have been originally made for some other object, and adapted for the crown. It is not an independent object, as it has no function alone. It was designed to be attached to the top rim of the Corona Gr√¶ca and provide a dome-shaped top. The inscription on the pictures of the saints and the style of their lettering suggest the date when they were made. Amidst the antique-style capital letter, the T in Thomas and the second U in Paulus are formed in the style characteristic of the Latin letters used on Byzantine coins, a practice abandoned in the middle of the eleventh century. They may have decorated a reliquary box or a portable altar given to Istv√°n I by the pope, or possibly the treasure binding of a book. It is also possible, although it cannot be verified, that Istv√°n I received a crown as a gift from one of the popes, reciprocating his ‚Äì historically documented - gifts. The picture of the apostles, however, based on their style, cannot be dated to around 1000. The intersecting bands are edged with beaded gold wire that close off the lower end of the bands and finish off the system of decoration. There are twelve pearls on the central panel and a total of seventy-two altogether on the Corona Latina, symbolising the number of Christ's disciples, (Acts 10.1). The central panel is decorated with a square cloisonn√© enamel picture depicting Christ Pantokrator. Each band has two (altogether eight) pictures of standing apostles identical to the first eight listed in Acts 1.13. √âva Kov√°cs and Zsuzsa LovagMagyar koronazasi jelvenyek, Eva Kovacs and Zsuzsa Lovag Budapest: Corvina Kiado, 1980; The Hungarian crown and other regalia translated by Peter Balban; translated and revised by Mary and Andras Boros-Kazai, pp. 79-80 suggest that the corona latina was originally a large Byzantine liturgical asterisk from a Greek monastery in Hungary. In order to get it to fit into it new role the apostles at the bottom of each of the four arms of this asterisk were cut off before it was very crudely attached to the inside of the corona graeca to transform this Byzantine open crown into a closed crown (i.e., the type of crown proper to the Autocrat, the senior emperor or monarch in Byzantine imperial protocol) and to provide a base for the reliquary cross at its summit (see Cross). =Cross= Matthias II of Hungary, showing the cross in vertical position The cross is attached to the crown in a rough manner, rising from the midriff of Christ in the central enamel plaque at the top of the crown. This addition might have been made during the 16th century. The cross was knocked crooked during the 17th century when the crown was damaged, possibly by the top of the iron chest housing the insignia being hastily closed without the crown having been placed in it properly. The cross has since been left in this slanted position, and is now typically depicted as such. √âva Kov√°cs suggests that the present plain cross on the top of the crown is a replacement of an original double-barred reliquary cross containing three pieces of the True Cross and that it was the presence of the True Cross in the Holy Crown which made it holy. She states that ‚ÄúSzabolcs Vajay, called to my attention a strange incident in the crown‚Äôs history which had completely escaped everybody‚Äôs attention. Before Queen Isabella handed over the regalia to Ferdinand in 1551, she broke the cross off the crown‚Äôs peak for her son, John Sigismund. According to a contemporary Polish chronicler, John Sigismund wore this cross on his chest till the end of his life, ‚Äú ... because he who possess this cross will again come into possession of the missing parts which, subjected to the power of the cross, had belonged to it\\". Later, the cross became the property of Sigismund Bathory who, persuaded by his confessor, bestowed it on Emperor Rudolf II. This was reported by an Italian envoy in Prague who also told the Isabella-John Sigismund story.‚Äù She also notes that ‚ÄúSeveral small fragments of the True Cross were in possession of the Arpad dynasty. As a point of interest, it is precisely the smallest ones, those set into the cross on the chest, that are attributed to St. Stephen. About a tiny fragment of the True Cross, a Russian chronicler recording King Geza II‚Äôs campaigns wrote that it had been the holy king‚Äôs property and, despite its small size, it was a relic of great force. We are, perhaps, not off the track when surmising that the Hungarian crown was holy because it had once been reinforced with a fragment of the victory-bringing relic. . . . we know quite few reliquary crowns. To mention but the most obvious example, let us cite Charles IV‚Äôs crown provided with a cross containing a thorn relic.‚Äù Later, it was the Crown itself, rather than the St. Stephen's cross reliquary that came to be regarded as holy through its traditional association with St. Stephen. √âva Kov√°cs further notes in this regard the early use of the patriarchal or double-barred cross and crown in the ancient Hungarian royal coat of arms. Since reliquary crosses frequently take such a double-barred form, the use of a patriarchal cross in the royal arms would be a direct reference to and representation of this royal relic. This association between the crown and this royal relic would also help to substantiate the theory that the Holy Crown was always intended to serve its historical role of legitimatizing the position of its wearer as the true divinely appointed king of Hungary. =The crown as a whole= Francis Joseph I crowned with the Holy Crown as Hungarian king The form of the Holy Crown is identical to that of the kamelaukion-type crowns with closed tops, as introduced in the Byzantine Empire. The presence of multiple pictures is also typical of Byzantine crowns. When the intersecting bands were added to the corona graeca during the rule of B√©la III, who had been brought up in Constantinople, the bands were decorated just as the corona graeca was, perhaps with the intention of imitating the Byzantine pattern. =Links to the first Hungarian king, Saint Stephen= Beside the using of the intersecting bands of the corona latina, which probably came from the treasury of St. Istv√°n, at the time of the creation of the crown there existed further expectation that the coronation insignia would eventually include additional gold works that could be linked to the first, beatified Hungarian king, Istv√°n. The inscription embroidered onto the coronation mantle indicates with all certainty that Istv√°n I and Queen Gizella had it made in 1031. The coronation sceptre with the orb at the end can also be dated to the time of St Istv√°n. On the seals of Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, and Rudolph III of Burgundy, the rulers are holding identically shaped sceptres. Such short-staffed sceptres ending in orbs were not in use as insignia earlier or later. The regalia in modern times Munk√°cs Castle commemorating the guarding of the Crown there in 1805‚Äì1806 After the fall of Communism, the crown was reincorporated into the national coat of arms in 1990, the National Assembly choosing the pre-war coat of arms in preference to the crown-less Kossuth arms of 1849. King Charles IV, taking his coronation oath at Holy Trinity Column outside Matthias Church (1916). To date, he is the last monarch to be crowned with St. Stephen's Crown. Notice the size difference between the crown and the king's head. The coat of arms of Hungary with the Holy Crown on top The Holy Crown has had a varied history; having been stolen, hidden, lost, recovered, and taken abroad several times. During the √Årp√°d dynasty (1000‚Äì1301), the coronation insignia was kept in the coronation city of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Later, the crown was housed in one of three locations: Visegr√°d (in Pest county); Pozsony (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia); or Buda. In 1805‚Äì1806 the Crown was kept for about three months in the Palanok Castle at Munk√°cs (now Mukachevo, Ukraine). Lajos Kossuth took the crown and the coronation jewels with him after the collapse of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and buried them in a wooden box in a willow forest, near Orsova in Transylvania (today Or≈üova, Romania). They were subsequently dug up and returned to the royal castle in Buda in 1853. At the end of the Second World War the crown jewels were recovered in Mattsee, Austria, on 4 May 1945 by the U.S. 86th Infantry Division. The crown jewels were transported to Western Europe and eventually given to the United States Army by the Hungarian Crown Guard for safekeeping from the Soviet Union. For much of the Cold War the crown was held at the United States Bullion Depository (Fort Knox, Kentucky) alongside the bulk of America's gold reserves and other priceless historical items. After undergoing extensive historical research to verify the crown as genuine, it was returned to Hungary by order of U.S. President Jimmy Carter on 6 January 1978. Most current academic knowledge about Hungarian royal garments originates from this modern research. Following substantial U.S. political debate, the agreement to return the jewels contained many conditions to ensure the people of Hungary, rather than its Communist government, took possession of the jewels. The majority of the Hungarian- American population opposed the decision to return the crown. On January 6, 1978, US Secretary of State Cyrus Vance returned the Crown to Hungary in Budapest.

On 1 January 2000, the Holy Crown of Hungary was moved to the Hungarian Parliament Building from the Hungarian National Museum. The sceptre, orb and the coronation sword were also moved to the Parliament. The very large coronation mantle remains in a glass inert gas vault at the National Museum due to its delicate, faint condition. Unlike the crown and accompanying insignia, the originally red coloured mantle is considered to date back to Stephen I, and was made circa 1030. Old records describe the robe as handiwork of the queen and her sisters and the mantle's middle back bears the king's only known portrait (which shows his crown was not the currently existing one). A circular inscription sewn in Latin identifies the coat as a bishop's chasuble. The sceptre is considered the artistically most valuable piece of the Hungarian royal inventory. It contains a solid rock crystal ball decorated with engraved lions, a rare product of the 10th-century Fatimid caliphate. Its handle contains a wooden rod surrounded by very fine wrought silver ornaments. The orb is unusual in having a patriarchal cross instead of a simple cross, as on the crown. The ceremonial straight sword kept in the Holy Crown collection is a 14th-century Italian product. However, what is said to be an original coronation sword of Stephen I has been in Prague's St. Vitus Cathedral since 1368.The sword has a walrus-tooth hilt decorated in the Mammen style, dated to the 10th century.

Founded in 1818 by Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg, it is the oldest university west of the Mississippi River and the second-oldest Jesuit university in the United States. It is one of 28 member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. The university is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. SLU has an enrollment of 12,546 students with an additional 7,101 students enrolled in its 1818 advanced college credit program. The 2019-20 student body includes 8,072 undergraduate students and 4,474 graduate students that represents all 50 states and more than 82 foreign countries. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". For more than 50 years, the university has maintained a campus in Madrid, Spain. The Madrid campus was the first freestanding campus operated by an American university in Europe and the first American institution to be recognized by Spain's higher education authority as an official foreign university. The campus has 850 students, a faculty of 110, an average class size of 17 and a student-faculty ratio of 12:1. SLU's athletic teams compete in NCAA's Division I and are a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference. History Saint Ignatius statue Saint Louis University traces its origins to the Saint Louis Academy, founded on November 16, 1818, by the Most Reverend Louis Guillaume Valentin Dubourg, Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas, and placed under the charge of the Reverend Fran√ßois Niel and others of the secular clergy attached to the Saint Louis Cathedral. Its first location was in a private residence near the Mississippi River in an area now occupied by the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial within the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Already having a two-story building for the 65 students using Bishop Dubourg's personal library of 8,000 volumes for its printed materials, the name Saint Louis Academy was changed in 1820 to Saint Louis College (while the secondary school division remained Saint Louis Academy, now known as St. Louis University High School). In 1827 Bishop Dubourg placed Saint Louis College in the care of the Society of Jesus. Not long after that, it received its charter as a university by act of the Missouri Legislature. In 1829 it moved to Washington Avenue and Ninth at the site of today's America's Center by The Dome at America's Center. In 1852 the university and its teaching priests were the subject of a viciously anti-Catholic novel, The Mysteries of St. Louis, written by newspaper editor Henry Boernstein whose popular paper, the Anzeiger des Westens was also a foe of the university.Catholicism and American Freedom,, John McGreevy Norton and Co., New York 2003, p. 22-23. In 1867 after the American Civil War the University purchased \\"Lindell's Grove\\" to be the site of its current campus.The University's main campus is named \\"Frost Campus\\" in honor of General Daniel M. Frost, commander of the Missouri Militia during the Camp Jackson Incident. After being exchanged for a captured Federal officer, General Frost \\"went south\\" and was commissioned as a General in the Confederate Army. The University named the campus after General Frost at the request of his daughter Mrs. Harriet Frost Fordyce, who contributed $1,000,000 to the University, allowing a major expansion in 1962. Frost Campus Ironically, part of the Frost Campus covers the former \\"Camp Jackson\\" militia encampment site. Lindell's Grove was the site of the Civil War \\"Camp Jackson Affair\\". On May 10, 1861 U.S. Regulars and Federally enrolled Missouri Volunteers arrested the Missouri Volunteer Militia after the militia received a secret shipment of siege artillery, infantry weapons and ammunition from the Confederate Government. While the Militia was arrested without violence, angry local citizens rushed to the site, and rioting broke out, in which 28 people were killed. The Camp Jackson Affair lead to open conflict within the state, culminating with a successful Federal offensive in mid-June 1861 which expelled the state's pro-secession governor Claiborne Fox Jackson from the state capitol (Jefferson City). Jackson later led a Missouri Confederate government-in-exile, dying of cancer in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1862. The first (and most iconic) building on campus, DuBourg Hall, began construction in 1888, and the college moved to its new location in 1889. St. Francis Xavier College Church moved to its current location with the completion of the lower church in 1884. It was completed in 1898.

Paul Reinert, SJ, stepped aside to be replaced by layman Daniel Schlafly, and the board shifted to an 18 to 10 majority of laypeople. This was largely because of Horace Mann vs. the Board of Public Works of Maryland, a landmark case heard by the Maryland Court of Appeals, which declared unconstitutional grants to \\"largely sectarian\\" colleges. The Second Vatican Council has also been mentioned as a major influence on this decision for its increased focus on the laity, as well as the decreased recruitment of nuns and priests since the council. From 1985 to 1992 the Chairman of the Board of Trustees was William H. T. Bush (younger brother of former President George H. W. Bush). The younger Bush also taught classes at the school.William H.T.

In the 2010-11 school year, the school announced the transfer of the Student Housing Scholarship (of $1,000 to $2,000) to Tuition Scholarship, which made off-campus housing more affordable and pursued by upperclassmen. Spring Hall and Grand Hall, built in 2016 and 2017 respectively, added nearly 1,000 beds for freshmen and sophomores in addition to a dining hall, more classrooms, and further office space for administrators. Freshman Year Experience options Student village on- campus apartments SLU has several Learning Communities (LCs), intended to allow freshmen and sophomores living on campus to surround themselves with like-minded or like-majored peers. As of 2020, over half of all SLU first- years choose to participate in a Learning Community. The Griesedieck Complex (also known as \\"Gries\\", pronounced \\"greez\\") has 16 stories of living space in its main building, as well as 9 additional floors of space attached on its west and east sides as Clemens Hall and Walsh Hall, respectively.Both halls were renovated and repainted (Walsh in 2019 and Clemens in 2020) to accommodate future larger freshman classes, and to house sophomores as needed. Upperclassmen options Flats, junior and senior apartments Sophomores participating in Greek Life can live in DeMattias Hall, the de facto community House. Next door is Marguerite Hall, with eight floors of suite-style two- occupancy dorm rooms. Grand Forest, the Village, and the Marchetti Towers are on-campus apartments for upperclassmen. The Marchetti Towers, just west of Grand Forest, are two 12-story towers that got a $3.8 million renovation in the summer of 2008. Major building and renovation projects During the past 20 years, the University has seen the modernization and construction of campus buildings as well as the revitalization of surrounding Midtown St. Louis. Some of the highlights of three decades at SLU include the investment of more than $840 million in improvements and expansions including the expansion of the Richard A. Chaifetz School of Business; construction of McDonnell Douglas Hall, home to Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology; the Center for Advanced Dental Education; the Doisy College of Health Sciences Building and the expansion and renovation of the Busch Student Center. Part of this expansion was the closing of two blocks of West Pine Boulevard (the section between N. Vandeventer Ave. and N. Grand Blvd.) and two blocks of N. Spring Ave. (between Lindell Blvd. and Laclede Ave.), both public streets which the campus had previously expanded across, converting them into a pedestrian mall. Furthermore, the University completed construction of the $82 million Edward A. Doisy Research Center in 2007 and the on-campus Chaifetz Arena in 2008. =Edward A. Doisy Research Center= Doisy research center IN 2007, SLU completed a $67 million, 10-story research center connected to its Medical Campus Building, a green building named for Edward Adelbert Doisy, Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate of 1943 and a long-time faculty member at SLU's medical school.SLU Press Release: SLU Research Building Named in Honor of Nobel Laureate Following $30 Million Gift The total cost was forecast to be around $80 million. It was dedicated on December 7, 2007. In July 2010, the Edward A. Doisy Research Center became home to the Center for World Health and Medicine, a non-profit drug discovery group dedicated to developing therapies for orphan and neglected diseases. In 2017, the organization closed due to lack of funding. = Saint Louis University School of Law = 280px Saint Louis University School of Law, founded in 1843, is the oldest law school west of the Mississippi River.School of Law History The students attend classes in Scott Hall, which is in downtown St. Louis.Scott Hall The Hall was previously renovated and for the first time, the Saint Louis University Law Library and Legal Clinics are housed under the same roof as the School. As of 2018, the dean was William P. Johnson. =Chaifetz Arena= The 2008 multi-purpose arena, built for $80.5 million, contains 10,600 seats for basketball, a training facility, state-of-the-art locker rooms, and a practice facility that can house 1,000 spectators. It is on the eastern end of campus, just north of I-64/US 40. The arena replaced Scottrade Center as the University's primary location for large events, notably Commencement celebrations and varsity sports. The arena is named for alumnus Dr. Richard Chaifetz, founder and CEO of ComPsych Corp., who gave $12 million to name it. The Arena was named on February 28, 2007, and dedicated on April 10, 2008. = COLLAB = In May 2019, Washington University in St. Louis and Saint Louis University launched the COLLAB at Cortex. The universities intend to use the 7,700-square-foot suite for various joint and separate projects, including training students in cybersecurity, entrepreneurship and other high- demand fields. COLLAB is also intended to forge deals with industry to turn research discoveries into products; find or train technology workers; and pursue geospatial research, data science, and health informatics. = Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Building = In the fall of 2020, the University opened a new, 90,000-square-foot, three-story structure featuring \\"innovative teaching environments and flexible lab spaces.\\" The building is expected to supplement bioinformatics, biology, biomedical engineering, chemistry, neuroscience and computer science courses that support all science, engineering, nursing and health science majors at SLU. Academics SLU offers 91 undergraduate majors and 83 graduate disciplines, along with programs adapted to working adults at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, including 25 completely online programs. Its average class size for undergraduates is 26 and the student-faculty ratio is 9:1. The University operates under one overall president but has the following schools with their own deans or directors: College of Arts and Sciences, College of Philosophy and Letters, Doisy College of Health Sciences, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, Center for Advanced Dental Education, College for Public Health and Social Justice, School of Social Work, Richard A.

The school has heavily invested in its on-campus athletic facilities in the past twenty years with the creation of Hermann Stadium and Chaifetz Arena. Chris May is the current director of athletics. Travis Ford, who took Oklahoma State to five NCAA tournaments in eight years, was hired as men's basketball coach in March 2016. The Saint Louis Billikens have a student-run fan club called the SLUnatics. This club supports all sporting Billiken athletic events focusing mostly on soccer and basketball. At Billiken basketball games, the SLUnatics have a large cheering section where they lead chants and cheers to engage the crowd. In order to encourage students to attend athletic events and be a part of SLUnatics, a program called Billiken Rewards was created. It is a free program where students collect credits at designated events to earn prizes. Through five different prize levels, students can earn a variety of Billiken merchandise.

The label of transgender man is not always interchangeable with that of transsexual man, although the two labels are often used in this way. Transgender is an umbrella term that includes different types of gender variant people (including transsexual people). Many trans men choose to undergo surgical or hormonal transition, or both (see sex reassignment therapy), to alter their appearance in a way that aligns with their gender identity or alleviates gender dysphoria. Although the literature indicates that most trans men identify as heterosexual (meaning they are sexually attracted to women), trans men, like cisgender men, can have any sexual orientation or sexual identity, such as homosexual, gay, bisexual, pansexual, or asexual, and some trans men might consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them, in which case they may elect to use labels like queer.  Terminology  Thomas Beatie at Stockholm Pride 2011, known in the media as the Pregnant Man, is a trans man who gave birth to three children. Lucas Silveira, lead singer and guitarist of The Cliks. The term trans man is used as a short form for either identity (transsexual man and transgender man). This commonly referred to as female-to-male (FTM or F2M). Transgender man is an umbrella term that may include anybody who was assigned female at birth (AFAB), but identifies as male. For instance, some androgynous, bigender, and genderqueer people might identify as transgender. Because transgender is an umbrella term, it can be imprecise and does not always describe specific identities and experiences. Transmasculine is a general, broader term for individuals who were AFAB but identify closer to the masculine (or male) side of the gender spectrum. The term transsexual originated in the medical and psychological communities. However, unlike the term transgender, transsexual is not an umbrella term, and many transgender people do not identify as such. Transsexual is a term for AFAB and assigned male at birth (AMAB) people alike who feel their sex organs do not reflect their gender and have chosen to change some aspect of their body; it is an older term, with GLAAD stating that it is \\"still preferred by some people who have permanently changed ‚Äì or seek to change ‚Äì their bodies through medical interventions (including but not limited to hormones and/or surgeries).\\" The transgender community sometimes uses the term passing to describe a transgender person's ability to appear as the gender they identify with. The opposite meaning is conveyed by the terms \\"to be read\\" or \\"to be clocked\\", and means not passing.  Transitioning  Buck Angel, a trans man and adult film producer. Ian Harvie, an American comedian and openly transgender man. Chaz Bono, American author and transgender activist. Originally, the term trans men referred specifically to female-to-male transsexual people who underwent hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or sex reassignment surgery (SRS), or both. The definition of transition has broadened to include theories of psychological development or complementary methods of self-acceptance. Many of those who identify as transgender may face gender dysphoria. Transsexual and transgender men may seek medical interventions such as hormones and surgery to make their bodies as congruent as possible with their gender presentation. However, many transgender and transsexual men cannot afford or choose not to undergo surgery or hormone replacement therapy. Many who have not undergone top surgery choose to bind their breasts. There are a few different methods of binding, including using sports bras and specially made binders (which can be vest-type, or wrap-around style). Tape or bandages, although often depicted in popular culture, should never be used for binding as they tighten with wear and compress the ribcage, and could result in injury. Some trans men might also decide to pack, to create a phallic bulge in the crotch of clothing. However, this is not universal. Trans men who decide to pack may use anything from rolled up socks to specially made packers, which resemble a penis. Some packers are also created for trans men to be able to urinate through them (stand-to-pee, or STP, devices), or for sexual penetration or other sexual activity (known as \\"pack-and-play\\"). Transitioning might involve some or all of the following steps:Ftmaustralia.org * Social transition: using a preferred name and pronouns, wearing clothing seen as gender appropriate, disclosure to family, friends and usually at the workplace/school. * Sex reassignment therapy: hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and/or surgery (SRS) * Legal affirmation: name and (sometimes) sex marker correction in legal identification documents. Being socially accepted as male (sometimes known as passing) may be challenging for trans men who have not undergone HRT and/or surgery. Some trans men may choose to present as female in certain social situations (e.g. at work). After physical transition, trans men usually live full-time as male. However, some transmasculine individuals might choose to use and engage their bodies to be pregnant, birth a baby, and chestfeed.  Prevalence, identity and relationships In the United States, the ratio of trans men within the general population is unclear, but estimates range between 1:2,000 and 1:100,000.Msu.edu A U.S. Census Bureau study in 2015 suggests that there were around 58,000 name changes in census records consistent with female to male transitions although only 7,500 of these changed their sex coding as well.Likely Transgender Individuals in U.S. Federal Administrative Records and the 2010 Census Census.gov In a study by Kara Devaney, entitled Transgender Research Literature Review, it is addressed that the term transgender encompasses a myriad of different and unique identities that do not follow the \\"normal\\" rules of gender. Miriam J. Abelson writes, \\"There is no question that trans men's experiences are men's experiences and give insight about men, masculinity, and gender inequality.\\" A trans man may be gay, bisexual, pansexual, polysexual, asexual, demisexual, etc., and some trans men consider conventional sexual orientation labels inadequate or inapplicable to them. The literature commonly indicates that sexual attraction to those of their same gender (e.g., trans men liking men and trans women liking women) is considerably less common among trans men than among trans women; the vast majority of trans men are reported as heterosexual. Surveys from the National Center for Transgender Equality show more variation in sexual orientation or sexual identity among trans men. In NCTE's 2015 Transgender Survey of respondents who identified as trans men, 23% identified as heterosexual or straight. The vast majority (65%) identified their sexual orientation or sexual identity as queer (24%), pansexual (17%), bisexual (12%), or gay/same-gender loving (12%). Some trans men date heterosexual women, while other trans men date queer-identified women; the latter might be because queer-identified women are less invested in the gender and sexual anatomy of a person when it comes to selecting an intimate partner. It is also common for trans men to have histories with the lesbian community or to feel that they identify better with that community because of its wide acceptance of gender variance, with a number of trans men having identified as lesbian (often as a \\"butch lesbian\\") before realizing that they are instead transgender. Trans men have less success integrating socially within cisgender gay men's communities, which tend to be more body-focused, especially in terms of being phallocentric. Yitzchak et al. state that, as a result, they more commonly see gay trans men partnering with each other than with cisgender gay men. There are, however, cases of women being likelier than men to thoroughly question trans men about their motivations for modifying their bodies. Some scholars argue against assumptions that trans men are predominantly heterosexual and usually have lesbian histories. In scholars Ian Irving and Rupert Raj's book Trans Activism in Canada, researchers state, \\"There is still a common misperception that trans men are largely heterosexual amongst those who conflate gender identity and sexual orientation. It is frequently assumed that trans men are exclusively attracted to women and have lesbian histories prior to transition.\\" They add, \\"Recent data from the Trans PULSE project (Bauer, Redman, Bradley, & Scheim, 2013) challenge this assumption, with 63 percent of female-to-male spectrum trans people in Ontario reporting non- heterosexual identities and/or past-year sex with trans or non-trans men.\\" They also argue that, based on some research, \\"many non-trans gay men have welcomed trans men into gay communities and have increasingly recognized trans men as potential sexual and romantic partners.\\"  Sexual violence  Trans men can be victims of sex crimes, and there are cases where rape has occurred, including with the intention of changing the sexual expressions and/or the sexuality of trans men; this is known as corrective rape. In a 2016 Bangkok Post article, a researcher stated, \\"Unlike in South Africa, where homophobic rape is rampant, with increasing trends as a large number of men still want to use violence to force trans people to abandon their sexual identity, there are no official surveys or studies about this problem in Thailand. [...] Recently some video clips emerged showing the rape of trans people.\\" Furthermore, the article told about two cases of rape of trans men in Thailand, and a claim that \\"it seems that quite a few people [in Thailand] would say they have heard of, or known about, such cases in their communities\\".  Health  Accessing health care services for trans men can be difficult. HIV infection between trans men and others is still increasing.

Lambton resigned from Parliament and ministerial office in 1973. Biography Lambton was born in Compton, Sussex, the second son of Diana Mary (n√©e Farquhar) and John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. He grew up on the family estates centred on Lambton Castle near Washington in County Durham, actually living at the nearby Biddick Hall. He was educated at Harrow School and served in the Hampshire Regiment during the Second World War, before being invalided out. He then did war work in a Wallsend factory. Marriage and children Lambton married Belinda (Bindy) Blew-Jones (born 23 December 1921, died 13 February 2003) on 10 August 1942. She was the daughter of Douglas Holden Blew-Jones and his wife Violet Hilda Margaret Birkin, sister of Freda Dudley Ward.Durham, Earl of (UK, 1833), cracroftspeerage.co.uk, accessed 2 January 2016 They had five daughters and one son: * Lady Lucinda Lambton (born 10 May 1943) * Lady Beatrix Mary Lambton (born 23 July 1949) * Lady Rose Diana Lambton (born 26 November 1952) * Lady Anne Mary Gabrielle Lambton (born 4 July 1954) * Lady Isabella Lambton (born 17 May 1958), married to Sir Philip Naylor-Leyland, 4th Baronet * Edward Richard Lambton, 7th Earl of Durham (born 19 October 1961) Politics =Member of Parliament= Lambton first stood for Parliament at the 1945 general election in the safe Labour seat of Chester-le-Street, then Bishop Auckland in 1950. He was elected to Durham City Council and to Durham County Council in 1947, serving for two years. He was elected Member of Parliament for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1951 where he served until 1973. =Under-Secretary of State= Lambton was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (RAF) in 1970. He succeeded to the Earldom of Durham upon his father's death on 4 February 1970 but disclaimed it on 23 February to continue as an MP and Government Minister. He nonetheless insisted on being addressed as \\"Lord Lambton\\", the form of address appropriate to his former courtesy title, though a ruling of the Committee for Privileges said that he should not do so in the House of Commons since he had renounced his peerage. Contradictory rulings from two Speakers, Horace King and Selwyn Lloyd, then left the point unresolved. =Resignation= In 1973, Lambton's liaisons with prostitutes were revealed in the Sunday tabloid The News of the World. The husband of one of the prostitutes, Norma Levy, had secretly taken photographs of Lambton in bed with Levy and had attempted to sell the photographs to Fleet Street tabloids. As well, a police search of Lambton's home found a small amount of cannabis. On 22 May, Lambton resigned from both his office and Parliament, which caused a by-election for his seat which was won by Alan Beith for the Liberal Party. Shortly after, the name Jellicoe emerged in connection to a rendezvous for one of Norma's girls at a Somers Town mansion block which had been named Jellicoe House, after the earl's kinsman Basil Jellicoe (1899‚Äì1935), the housing reformer and priest from Magdalen College (Oxford). There was a confusion and Lord Jellicoe, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, admitted 'casual affairs' with prostitutes from a Mayfair escort agency but denied knowing Norma Levy. A security inquiry on the prostitution scandal concluded that there had been \\"nothing in (Lambton's) conduct to suggest that the risk of indiscretions on these occasions was other than negligible.\\" Lambton stated that he had never taken his red state boxes of government documents with him when he visited Norma Levy. The security inquiry was held due to fears that the prostitution scandal may have involved an actual or potential breach of national security (as had occurred in the Profumo scandal in the 1960s). When Lambton was interviewed by MI5 officer Charles Elwell, Lambton first claimed that the pressure of his job as a minister was what drove him to procure the prostitutes. Later, Lambton stated that his sense of \\"the futility of the job\\" and lack of demanding tasks as a junior minister were reasons he went to prostitutes. Finally, Lambton claimed that his judgment was faulty when he went to the prostitutes due to his obsession with the battle over the use of an aristocratic title that had been used by his father; Lambton claimed that he sought to soothe this obsession by engaging in frantic activities such as gardening and debauchery. Later years For the last three decades of his life, Lambton spent his energies restoring Villa Cetinale in Tuscany After Dark (right) Following the scandal, Lambton retired, separated from his wife and bought Villa Cetinale, a 17th-century villa in Tuscany, where he lived with Claire Ward, n√©e Baring, mother of actress Rachel Ward and daughter of the cricketer Giles Baring.Anonymous.

In 1991, he made an extended appearance on the TV discussion programme After Dark, chaired by Baroness Helena Kennedy, alongside Duncan Campbell, Jane Moore, Clare Short, Anthony Howard and others.Details here Despite renouncing his titles, he continued to use his former courtesy title Viscount Lambton, although, since it was now a title that had passed by courtesy to his eldest son, it was argued by Sir Anthony Wagner and others that this was incorrect. Lambton died in hospital in Siena, Italy, on 30 December 2006.

As Fiji's First Lady, Adi Lala took on a diplomatic role, frequently representing her country abroad. She was regarded as a formidable and astute woman, whose influence on her husband was said to be considerable.  Family background  From her father George Tuisawau, she inherited the title of Roko Tui Dreketi, the traditional title of the rulers of the Burebasaga Confederacy, which covers the provinces of Rewa, Nadroga-Navosa, Namosi, Serua, Kadavu (off the southern coast of Viti Levu), and parts of Ba and Ra. Her mother, Adi Asenaca Vosailagi, was from the chiefly Ka Levu clan of Nadroga, where she was a chief in her own right. The village of Lomanikoro in Rewa Province is the capital of the confederacy. Adi Lala's marriage, on 9 September 1950, to Ratu Mara, who was to become the Tui Lau and Tui Nayau (the traditional ruler of the Lau Islands) was considered a dynastic marriage, as it united two powerful feudal families. Relations between the families had been strained in the past, so the marriage was opposed in certain quarters, especially on Ratu Mara's side. Nevertheless, the marriage was by all accounts a happy one and lasted 54 years, until Ratu Mara's death on 18 April 2004. The duration of this marriage was in stark contrast to the prevalence of divorce in much of the Mara clan. Three sons and five daughters issued from their marriage, two of whom have pursued political careers of their own. Their eldest son, Ratu Finau Mara, served as a member of the House of Representatives and of the Cabinet throughout the 1990s, and led the Fijian Association Party from 1996 to 1998. Their second daughter, Adi Koila Mara Nailatikau, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1999 and was Minister of Tourism in 1999 and 2000. She was a Senator from 2001 to 2006, and has been First Lady since 2009, being married to the President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau.  Political career  In 1991, Adi Lala founded the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei, or SVT) as the successor to the disbanded Alliance Party that her husband had founded and led, but for the leadership she was outmanoeuvred by Sitiveni Rabuka, who had led the Fiji coups of 1987. To the end of her life, Adi Lala remained active in the Great Council of Chiefs, where she was regarded as a voice of moderation. On 12 November 2003, Radio New Zealand reported that Adi Lala had bitterly accused some chiefs, whom she did not name, of having been involved in the coup d'√©tat which deposed her husband from the presidency in May 2000 and also toppled the elected government. Opening a meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs, she said that the perpetrators of the coup were \\"false prophets\\" motivated by greed, who were inciting racial strife and uncertainty with their threats, and that the coups had brought Fiji to its knees. She called on her fellow-chiefs to re-examine their roles, especially in regard to promoting racial harmony in a multicultural nation. She said some chiefs had also been involved in the earlier coups of 1987.  Controversies following her death  Ro Lala's death, only three months after that of her husband, was announced in Suva on 20 July 2004. No immediate cause of death was given. Allegations were subsequently made in Parliament, however, that she had suffered a fatal heart attack after hearing the distressing news that her son-in-law, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, was to be dismissed as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, which was \\"the last straw\\" after her husband's death three months earlier. Senator James Ah Koy claimed on the floor of the Senate to have received the information from sources close to Adi Lala's family, and charged the Qarase government with responsibility for her death because of its involvement in Ganilau's sacking. His comments drew a strong rebuke from the Chairman of the Kadavu Provincial Council, which Ah Koy represented in the Senate. Ratu Joe Nawalowalo called his speech \\"gutter material\\" which \\"belittled\\" the close relationship Adi Lala had enjoyed with the province.  Statue proposed  Adi Lala was succeeded as Roko Tui Dreketi by her younger sister, Ro Teimumu Vuikaba Kepa, who also served as Minister for Education in the Qarase government from 2000 to 2006. The women's organisation Soqosoqo Vakamarama i Taukei announced on 21 July 2005, the day after the first anniversary of Adi Lala's death, that it was setting up a foundation that would help build a statue of the late Adi Lala, who was the founder of the Soqosoqo Vakamarama and its president until her death. The period of mourning for Adi Lala ended on 20‚Äì21 September 2005, with a ceremony at the chiefly village of Cuvu in Nadroga, where her mother was from. Attended by large delegations of chiefs and commoners from the Kubuna and Tovata as well as her own Burebasaga Confederacy, the ceremonies included the presentation of more than two container-loads of gifts including tabua (whales' teeth), masi (tapa cloth), canoes, mats, and lavish quantities of food, and culminated in a feast. Earlier, Ro Epeli Mataitini, the Younger brother of the official Vunivalu (a Chiefs Right Hand) for the Roko Tui Dreketi, had spoken of the love and respect that Fijians had for Adi Lala. While humans planned their future, he said, God always had the final say in people's lives, which was why it was so important to appreciate and maintain the links that bound Fiji's chiefly clans together. He called on younger Fijians to learn from the older chiefs who, despite political differences, cherished their links to the different tribes that make up the nation. 1931 births 2004 deaths Fijian chiefs Roko Tui Dreketi First Ladies of Fiji Fijian Roman Catholics Politicians from Lomanikoro ","title":"Lala Mara"},{"id":"598104","text":"Dubingiai () is a town in Molƒótai district in Lithuania.

He is the former Minister for Foreign Affairs. Kubuabola worked as an assistant manager for the New Zealand Insurance Company in Auckland and Suva. From 1975 to 1987 he was secretary of the South Pacific Bible Society. A Fijian nationalist, he was involved in the planning of the 1987 Fijian coups d'√©tat. Following the coup he was appointed Minister for Information in the Military Government, and subsequently served as Minister for Information, Broadcasting, Television and Telecommunication. Kubuabola was elected to Parliament in the 1992 election as a candidate for the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) and reappointed to Cabinet as Minister for Youth, Employment Opportunities and Sports. He was re-elected at the 1994 election and was appointed Minister for Regional Development and Multi Ethnic Affairs. In 1996 he was appointed Minister of Works, Infrastructure and Transport. Following the defeat of the SVT government at the 1999 election and the subsequent resignation of its leader, the defeated Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, Kubuabola became leader of the SVT and Leader of the Opposition. Under the 1997 Constitution of Fiji the Leader of the Opposition chose 8 of the 32 members of the Senate, and Kubuabola sparked controversy in the role by limiting his selection to members of opposition parties. Following the Fiji coup of 2000 Kubuabola was appointed Minister for Information and Communications in the interim Cabinet formed by Laisenia Qarase. He held this office till September 2001, when he lost his seat in the 2001 election. That year he also resigned the Chairmanship of the Cakaudrove Provincial Council, which he had led for served years, to Sitiveni Rabuka.  Diplomat  Kubuabola served as Fiji's High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea from 2002 to 2005. In late 2005, he attempted to handle the problem of Fijian security guards, whom some accused of being mercenaries, operating illegally on the island of Bougainville. On 4 May 2006 Kubuabola was posted to Tokyo as Fiji's Ambassador to Japan and Korea, replacing Ratu Tevita Momoedonu. He remained in this position until July 2009 when he was named Minister for Foreign Affairs by the Interim Government.

He is also believed to have been an actor who specialized in clown roles. He was connected with sixteen plays intended for Philip Henslowe's Rose Theatre, in partnership with other playwrights who also produced copy for Henslowe. While mentioned as a dramatist by Francis Meres in 1598, most existing information on his dramatic career is derived from Henslowe's papers. Since the name is common, it is not certain that the Robert Wilson who worked for Henslowe in 1598-1600 is the same man who was a prominent actor and occasional playwright in the 1580s; yet many scholars consider it more likely than not that the records refer to one Robert Wilson and not two. If this is correct, Wilson was acting with Leicester's Men in the 1570s, and was praised along with Richard Tarlton for his \\"wit.\\" He is generally accepted as the author of The Three Ladies of London (published 1584), The Three Lords and Three Ladies of London (published 1590), and The Cobbler's Prophecy (published 1594). It has been speculated that he may also have written Fair Em (c. 1590). In Palladis Tamia (1598), Francis Meres mentions Wilson along with Tarlton, and specifically connects Wilson with the Swan Theatre, which was built c. 1595. In just over two years, from spring 1598 to summer 1600, Wilson worked with other members of Henslowe's stable of house playwrights on sixteen different plays, including three two-part projects. Several of these were never completed. # Earl Goodwin and his Three Sons, Parts 1 and 2, with Michael Drayton, Henry Chettle, and Thomas Dekker; March 1598. # Piers of Exton, with Drayton, Chettle, and Dekker; March 1598. # Black Bateman of the North, Parts 1 and 2, with Chettle; Part I with Dekker and Drayton also; May‚ÄìJune 1598. # The Funeral of Richard Cordelion, with Chettle, Drayton, and Anthony Munday; June 1598. # The Madman's Morris, with Dekker and Drayton, July 1598. # Hannibal and Hermes, with Dekker and Drayton, July 1598. # Pierce of Winchester, with Dekker and Drayton, July‚ÄìAugust 1598. # Catiline's Conspiracy, with Chettle; August 1598. Apparently never completed. # Chance Medley, with Munday, Drayton, and Dekker or Chettle; August 1598. # Sir John Oldcastle, Parts 1 and 2, with Drayton, Munday, and Richard Hathwaye; Oct.-Dec. 1599. # Henry Richmond, Part 2, with others; never completed. # Owen Tudor, with Drayton, Hathwaye, and Munday; Jan. 1600. Apparently never completed. # Fair Constance of Rome, Part 1, with Dekker, Drayton, Hathwaye, and Munday; June 1600. Of Wilson's collaborations for Henslowe, only the first part of Sir John Oldcastle was published, in 1600 and 1619. None of the other plays has survived. Sir John Oldcastle was commissioned as a counterblast to the negative depiction of title character in the original versions of William Shakespeare's plays Henry IV, Part 1 and Henry IV, Part 2. Objections from descendants of the historical John Oldcastle, a Protestant martyr, appears to have been responsible both for the writing of the corrective Oldcastle play and the alteration of Oldcastle to Sir John Falstaff in later versions of the Henry IV plays. Also, Wilson has been proposed as a possible author of several anonymous Elizabethan plays, including Fair Em, The Pedlar's Prophecy, A Larum for London, Look About You, Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes, and A Knack to Know a Knave.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 516.S. R. Golding, \\"Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More\\", Notes & Queries 154 (1928), 237-9. As to why a writer would work the way the Henslowe collaborators did: the careers of dramatists who worked mostly on solo projects, like Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, show that a dramatist working alone could produce one or two plays a year on a dependable basis.In 1635 the Caroline era playwright Richard Brome signed a contract to write three plays a year, but couldn't meet the demand. If one of those plays failed to sell, or flopped with the audience, the writer was severely affected. Collaborative writing spread the risk, and could provide a more certain income for a journeyman author. A \\"Robert Wilson, yeoman (player)\\" was buried at St. Giles in Cripplegate on 20 November 1600. This is consistent with the view that the two Robert Wilsons, the player with Leicester's Men and Henslowe's dramatist, were one and the same person; it explains why Henslowe's Wilson stopped writing in 1600.H.

If no command-line argument is given, this command looks for a pair of lines from the two files having the same first field (a sequence of characters that are different from space), and outputs a line composed of the first field followed by the rest of the two lines. The program arguments specify which character to be used in place of space to separate the fields of the line, which field to use when looking for matching lines, and whether to output lines that do not match. The output can be stored to another file rather than printing using redirection. As an example, the two following files list the known fathers and the mothers of some people.

History  Bakel beach from the fort During the Perumal Age Bekal was a part of Mahodayapuram. Following the decline of Mahodayapuram Perumals, Bekal came under the sovereignty of the Mushika or Kolathiri or Chirakkal Royal Family in the 12th century.The Hindu, 22 Oct 2005 The maritime importance of Bekal increased under the Kolathiris and Malabar became an important port town. After the Battle of Talikota in 1565 feudatory chieftains including the Keladi Nayakas (Ikkeri Nayaks) became powerful in the region. Bekal served as a hub to first dominate, then later defend Malabar. The economic importance of this port town prompted the Nayakas to fortify Bekal subsequently. Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka initiated the construction of the fort and it was completed in 1650 AD by Shivappa Nayaka. Chandragiri fort near Kasargod was also built during this period.Kasargod: History & Society The struggles between the Kolathiries and Nayaks to hold this area ended when Hyder Ali conquered the Nayakas and Bekal fell into the hands of Mysore kings. It was an important military station for Tipu Sultan when he led a military expedition to capture Malabar. The coins and artefacts found in archaeological excavations at Bekal fort indicate the strong presence of Mysore Sultans. Tipu Sultan's death during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War ended Mysorean control in 1799. The fort came under the British East India Company's controlMadras District Manual and became the headquarters of the Bekal Taluk of South Canara District in Bombay presidency. The political and economic importance of Bekal and its port declined. Nearby the Mukhyaprana Temple of Hanuman and ancient Muslim mosque bear testimony to the religious harmony that prevailed in the area.  Tourism  India declared Bekal Fort a special tourism area in 1992 and formed Bekal Tourism Development Corporation three years later to promote it.

It has a syntax similar to FORTRAN and BASIC, along with BCD arithmetic. It shares the COBOL program structure of separate data and procedure divisions. Unlike Fortran's numeric labels (for GOTO), DIBOL's were alphanumeric; the language supported a counterpart to computed goto.example: GOTO(XSMALL,XMED,XLARG),XCODE History DIBOL was originally marketed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1970. The original version, DIBOL-8, was produced for PDP-8 systems running COS-300. The PDP-8-like DECmate II, supports the COS-310 Commercial Operating System, featuring DIBOL. DIBOL-11 was developed for the PDP-11 running COS-350 operating system. It also ran on RSX-11, RT-11, and from 1978 on RSTS/E. DIBOL-32 runs on VAX/VMS systems, although it can also be used on other systems through emulators. ANSI Standards were released in 1983, 1988 and 1992 (ANSI X3.165-1992). The 1992 standard was revised in 2002. DIBOL compilers were developed by several other companies, including DBL from DISC (later Synergex), Softbol from Omtool, and Unibol from Software Ireland, Ltd. Development of DIBOL effectively ceased after 1993, when an agreement between DEC and DISC replaced DIBOL with DBL on OpenVMS, OSF/1, and SCO Unix.

They spend their larval stage inside the fruits of figs. The pollinating wasps (Agaoninae, Kradibiinae, and Tetrapusiinae) are the mutualistic partners of the fig trees. The nonpollinating fig wasps are parasitic. Extinct forms from the Eocene and Miocene are nearly identical to modern forms, suggesting that the niche has been stable over geologic time. Taxonomy The family has changed several times since its taxonomic appearance after the work of Francis Walker in 1846 described from the wasp genus Agaon. For long the subfamilies Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoecinae, Sycoryctinae, Sycophaginae, and Agaoninae were the subdivisions of the family. Recent works building strong molecular phylogenies with an extended sampling size have changed the composition of Agaonidae. First, the paraphyletic groups have been excluded (Epichrysomallinae, Otitesellinae, Sycoecinae, and Sycoryctinae) and new subfamilies have been instated (Kradibiinae and Tetrapusiinae). Then the subfamily Sycophaginae have been placed within the family Agaonidae. Within the Sycophaginae, some changes were made after the molecular phylogeny of the subfamily: the genus Apocryptophagus has been synonymined under the genus Sycophaga. Ecology Wasps from the three subfamilies Agaoninae, Kradibiinae and Tetrapusiinae are pollinating fig wasps. On the other hand, Sycophaginae are parasites of the Ficus, developing in the fruits after other wasps have pollinated them. Nevertheless, some species in the genus Sycophaga have a controversial status; as they enter the fig by its ostiole, they possibly bring pollen inside the fig and might pollinate it. Morphological adaptations The pollinating female fig wasps are winged and in general dark, while the males are mostly wingless and whitish. This difference of color is probably due to a clear split in the gender role. Once they have mated, male and female fig wasps have different fates. In some fig species, such as Ficus subpisocarpa or Ficus tinctoria, the males have to chew a hole for the females to leave their natal fig. The winged female wasps can fly over long distances before finding another fig to oviposit in it, while the male dies after chewing a hole. As the fig is closed by a tight ostiole, the female wasps have developed adaptations to enter. First, the mandibles of the female wasps have developed specialized mandibular appendages to help them crawl into the figs. These appendages are adapted to the host fig species, with for instance spiraled ostioles matched by spiral mandibular appendages. The nonpollinating wasps also have developed impressive morphological adaptations to deposit eggs inside the fig from the outside, in the form of an extremely long ovipositor.

The EL is a badge- engineered Honda Civic with a higher level of features. There is no Type-S trim offered on both Acura ELs. The Acura EL was a sales success. Representing 51% of Acura Canada's annual new-vehicle sales in its first full year, the EL remained Acura's top seller in Canada from 1997 to 2003. The Acura EL was replaced for the 2006 model year by the Acura CSX which, like the EL, was available only in Canada. TOC First generation (1997‚Äì2000) 1999‚Äì2000 Acura 1.6EL The first generation of the EL was a rebadged version of the Japanese market Honda Domani, a somewhat altered version of the 1997‚Äì2000 Honda Civic with differing front end, trunk, lights and various interior pieces. Honda sold the upscale Domani at Japanese dealership sales channel called Honda Clio that sold large, or well equipped luxury sedans like the Honda Legend and the Honda Inspire, and sold the more affordable Honda Civic at Honda Primo locations. Sold in Canada as the Acura 1.6EL, Seeing that sales within Canada for the four-door Acura Integra were extremely low, Honda decided to replace it with the four-door-only Acura EL. Its 1.6 L VTEC engine produces at 6600 rpm and at 5500 rpm. It has features not available on the similar Civic such as amber-lit LED interior dash display, tachometer, power trunk (no keyhole on the trunk), alarm, 15-inch (195/55/15) wheels, antenna in the rear window glass, chrome interior door handles, extra pocket underneath centre console, paint-matched mirrors, side moldings, and door handles, slightly stiffer suspension, 12 mm rear sway bar and 26 mm front sway bar, heated mirrors, and an amplifier. From 1999 all 5-speed models had a leather- wrapped shift knob, similar to the one in the Acura Integra GSR. =Model configurations= In addition to the above: * Base: CD player, air conditioning * Sport: 15-inch alloy wheels, CD player, air conditioning. From 1999: folding heated mirrors, a sunroof, and an upgraded grill on the front end. * Premium: in addition to the Sport, leather seats, and decorative spoiler. Second generation (2001‚Äì2005) 2004-05 Acura EL The EL was completely redesigned for the 2001 model year and was then based on the seventh-generation Civic. In addition to the slightly more powerful and torquier VTEC-equipped 1.7 L 4-cylinder SOHC engine with 127 hp (95 kW), headlight and taillight designs and available leather interior trimmings set it apart from the Civic. Other differences include 15-inch multi-spoke alloys, heated power mirrors, cruise control, and rear disc brakes. The badging was changed to Acura 1.7EL and was dropped altogether for 2004. The second- generation was available in touring and premium trim levels. The latter added leather seats, heated front seats and a power sunroof. Automatic climate control was added for the premium trim in 2003, and for the touring trim as well in 2004. All second generation EL models came with ABS anti-lock braking, but in 2003 an electronic brakeforce distribution system was made standard. For 2003 and 2004 a special dealer-installed 'aero package' was made available for both trims levels which added unique front and rear lips, side stills and a rear spoiler. In 2004, the EL underwent a slight exterior makeover with restyled headlamps, front bumper and grille, taillights, trunk lid, and rear bumper. The new look came with standard fog lights, a restyled steering wheel, new woodgrain trim patterns, and two additional tweeters powered by two amplifiers to complete the 6-speaker audio system. Discontinuation Despite being Acura Canada‚Äôs best selling vehicle, Honda announced that it will discontinue the EL. In 2006, the CSX was confirmed to be a replacement for the EL. Like the EL, the CSX was sold only in Canada. The CSX was discontinued in 2011. The CSX was confirmed after the car is discontinued and is sold only in Canada until 2011.

McQueen narrowly missed election to Parliament in the 1996 general election. He was ranked 4th on the Christian Coalition party list. The Coalition fell just under the MMP threshold. In August 2003, McQueen was elected as the new leader of Christian Heritage NZ, and replaced the retiring Graham Capill. In October 2006, McQueen announced the closure of Christian Heritage NZ, blaming its demise on Graham Capill's criminal convictions, although he hoped to be involved with a new conservative Christian political party .

The song consists almost in its entirety of an unofficial soundalike sampled loop from \\"Whistle Stop\\" by Roger Miller which was featured in the Disney movie Robin Hood, played at high speed in a manner similar to the classic \\"Chipmunks\\" records. The original sample, also sped up, was first featured on the Internet as part of \\"The Hampster Dance\\" song on the website of the same name. Background The song was first aired on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show on April 7, 1999 and quickly became one of the most requested songs on his show. After being included on a free sampler CD on the industry magazine The Tip Sheet, the song caught the attention of numerous large record labels including EMI, Parlophone and RCA, thanks mostly to the efforts of Jonathan King. The band eventually signed for EMI. They were given ¬£25,000 to record a video for the song which ended up featuring a giant fibreglass melon covered in trifle and a live-action hamster singing along. Originally scheduled for release as a single in November 1999, the release date was threatened to be pushed back to some time in January 2000 until the song was played on Jo Whiley's afternoon radio show. It received much the same attention as when it had been played on Peel's show. The decision was made to move the release to December 13 to put it in line for the Christmas number 1 slot. It managed to get to number 4 in the Christmas chart week,http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/cognoscenti%20vs%20intelligentsia/ being beaten by Westlife's \\"I Have a Dream\\". The song did however top John Peel's Festive Fifty for that year. The song's closing lines are of an announcer of a children's radio show: :\\"And this is your Uncle Dan saying good night. :Good night, little kids, good night. :We're off? Good, well that oughta hold the little bastards.\\" This last line, usually omitted on radio play, is itself a sample from Kermit Schafer's 1950s \\"recreation\\" of a supposed on-air blooper by 1920s children's radio presenter, \\"Uncle Don\\". In fact, this faux pas is an urban legend.Snopes: That oughta hold the little bastards! The sample caused many complaints to the band's label EMI, enough for a Parental Advisory sticker to be included on the single by the end of the single's first week of release, presumably by those assuming the song to be aimed at children. Additionally, the sample was left unedited on Now 45 and when the song was played by Jo Whiley on BBC Radio 1 in November, the broadcast of the song which eventually greenlit the single's release by EMI, the sample was again unedited, causing much controversy. The song itself is, like many recordings by the band, dotted with other humorous quotes from old movies, TV and radio programmes, including the 1965 Michael Winner movie You Must Be Joking!, and at least one from the 1950s dramatization of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth: \\"Don't be too happy. After some of months of this you'll be smacking your lips at the thought of salt beef\\". The \\"B-side\\" tracks on the single exhibit similar traits, with e.g. Fluorescent Dream Beams featuring several samples from 1974's Phantom of the Paradise, alongside an original vocal. Somewhat ironically, whilst the movie quotes are original, the core sample had to be re-recorded as a close but imperfect soundalike owing to copyright clearance issues - a problem that also plagued several other Cuban Boys singles and many tracks on the Eastwood album (e.g. Kenny, I Like Everybody), though it is unclear whether the holders refused permission (heavily suggested in the case of Inertia Kicks) or EMI simply declined to pay the licensing fees. It is known that in the case of later single The Hampsterdance Song which was recorded by the group The Boomtang Boys under the name Hampton the Hampster, Disney did not want the sample to be used. That single also ultimately used a soundalike. Release Unlike the later single \\"The Hampsterdance Song\\", \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" was released without the involvement of the owner of the original website, Deidre LaCarte. LaCarte accused the Cuban Boys of stealing in an article in the Mail on Sunday Reception The song garnered extreme reactions. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray said the song was \\"eloquent in its sheer vacuity\\" during a highbrow debate on Channel 4 News, and Cliff Richard, whose song \\"The Millennium Prayer\\", which had been number 1 in the three weeks before the chart debut of \\"Cognoscenti vs. Intelligentsia\\" and was released to very negative reviews, said the song was \\"awful\\" during an appearance on Newsround. The band's performance on Top of the Pops of the song, reportedly unaired, saw the band dressed in lab coats and covered in cobwebs. Because of the relative obscurity of the Cuban Boys both before and after the single, they are generally considered to be a one-hit wonder. The people behind the Cuban Boys went on to score further one-hit wonder successes with a remake of \\"Rhinestone Cowboy\\" with Glen Campbell, a novelty kids band called the Barndance Boys, and the US club hit \\"I Am Gothic\\" under the name Spray.

A low-tack pressure-sensitive adhesive allows the notes to be easily attached, removed and even re-posted elsewhere without leaving residue. Originally small yellow squares, Post-it Notes and related products are available in various colors, shapes, sizes and adhesive strengths. As of 2019, there are at least 26 documented colors of Post-it Notes. Although 3M's patent expired in 1997, \\"Post-it\\" and the original notes' distinctive yellow color remain registered company trademarks, with terms such as \\"repositionable notes\\" used for similar offerings manufactured by competitors. While use of the trademark 'Post-it' in a representative sense refers to any sticky note, no legal authority has ever held the trademark to be generic. History Arthur Fry with a Post-it Note on his forehead The adhesive side of a Post-it Note, magnified 555x on an SEM In 1968, Dr. Spencer Silver, a scientist at 3M in the United States, was attempting to develop a super-strong adhesive. Instead, he accidentally created a \\"low-tack\\", reusable, pressure-sensitive adhesive. For five years, Silver promoted his \\"solution without a problem\\" within 3M both informally and through seminars, but failed to gain acceptance. In 1974, a colleague who had attended one of his seminars, Art Fry, came up with the idea of using the adhesive to anchor his bookmark in his hymn book. Fry then utilized 3M's officially sanctioned \\"permitted bootlegging\\" policy to develop the idea. The original notes' yellow color was chosen by accident, as the lab next-door to the Post-It team had only yellow scrap paper to use. 3M launched the product as \\"Press 'n Peel\\" bookmark in stores in four cities in 1977, but results were disappointing. A year later, 3M instead issued free samples directly to consumers in Boise, Idaho, with 94 percent of those who tried them indicating they would buy the product. The product was sold as \\"Post-Its\\" in 1979 when the rollout introduction began, and was sold across the United States from April 6, 1980. The following year, they were launched in Canada and Europe. In 2003, the company came out with \\"Post-it Brand Super Sticky Notes\\", with a stronger glue that adheres better to vertical and non- smooth surfaces. Until 3M's patent expired in the 1990s, Post-it type notes were produced only in the company's plant in Cynthiana, Kentucky. In 2018, 3M launched the new \\"Post-It Extreme Notes\\", designed to be more durable and water-resistant, and to stick to a variety of surfaces to which regular Post- It notes do not easily adhere. The Post-It Extreme Notes were specifically designed with work environments like construction and manufacturing in mind. =Competing claims= Alan Amron has made claims to be the inventor who in 1973 disclosed the technology used on the Post-it Note to 3M in 1974. His 1997 suit against 3M was settled and 3M paid Amron. As part of the settlement, Amron undertook not to make future claims against the company except if ever a breach of the settlement agreement should occur. However, in 2016, he launched a further suit against 3M, asserting that 3M were wrongly claiming to be the inventors, and seeking $400 million in damages.Alan Amron v. 3M Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. et al., case number 9:16-cv-80125, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. At a preliminary hearing, a federal judge ordered the parties to undergo mediation. The suit was subsequently dismissed declaring the previous 1998 settlement agreement to be upheld. In July 2016 a former 3M marketing department employee, Daniel Dassow, voluntarily came forward as an eyewitness that in 1974 Alan Amron had in fact disclosed his Press-on memo sticky notes invention to 3M.

The 41 drawings displayed are a tiny percentage of the more than 2000 original drawings that constitute the Yellow Stickee Diary Project which Arenas created while working temp jobs from 1994 to 2005. Printed with archival inks on archival paper, the reproductions include \\"stickee sized\\" (3\\" √ó 5\\") framed prints and enlargements of the original drawings (which were all done on Post-It Notes). In 2012, Turkish artist Ardan √ñzmenoƒülu was selected to have a solo exhibition at Bertrand Delacroix Gallery in the art district of Chelsea, Manhattan. The exhibition, titled \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" (Latin for \\"Out of many, one\\"), opened November 15, 2012 and featured large scale works on Post-It Notes. In 2004, Paola Antonelli, a curator of architecture and design, included Post-it Notes in a show entitled \\"Humble Masterpieces\\". Rebecca Murtaugh, a California artist who uses Post-it Notes in her artwork, in 2001 created an installation by covering her whole bedroom with $1000 worth of the notes, using the ordinary yellow for objects she saw as having less value and neon colors for more important objects, such as the bed. In 2000, the 20th anniversary of Post-it Notes was celebrated by having artists create artworks on the notes. One such work, by the artist R. B. Kitaj, sold for ¬£640 in an auction, making it the most valuable Post-It Note on record. The Lennon Wall, a message board created during the 2014 Hong Kong protests from a stretch of curved staircase in the Central Government Complex, is covered in multi-coloured Post-It Notes with handwritten messages from supporters. Satiregram, a parody account on Instagram by Euzcil Castaneto, showcases handwritten messages on Post-it Notes that describe typical pictures people would post on Instagram. Software implementations Virtual Post-It Notes have been created for computers in the form of desktop notes. These include 3M's own Post-it Brand Software Notes, Stickies in Mac OS, Sticky Notes in Windows, or other applications like ShixxNOTE. Virtual Post-It‚Äìlike notes are also available online using Evernote, Google Keep, or Microsoft OneNote. In 1997, 3M sued Microsoft for trademark infringement for using the term \\"Post-It\\" in a help file.

It involved two stages: production of sodium sulfate from sodium chloride, followed by reaction of the sodium sulfate with coal and calcium carbonate to produce sodium carbonate. The process gradually became obsolete after the development of the Solvay process.  Background  Soda ash (sodium carbonate) and potash (potassium carbonate), collectively termed alkali, are vital chemicals in the glass, textile, soap, and paper industries. The traditional source of alkali in western Europe had been potash obtained from wood ashes. However, by the 13th century, deforestation had rendered this means of production uneconomical, and alkali had to be imported. Potash was imported from North America, Scandinavia, and Russia, where large forests still stood. Soda ash was imported from Spain and the Canary Islands, where it was produced from the ashes of glasswort plants (called barilla ashes in Spain), or imported from Syria. The soda ash from glasswort plant ashes was mainly a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. In addition in Egypt, naturally occurring sodium carbonate, the mineral natron, was mined from dry lakebeds. In Britain, the only local source of alkali was from kelp, which washed ashore in Scotland and Ireland. Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). Chemical Revolution, (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65-90. . In 1783, King Louis XVI of France and the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize of 2400 livres for a method to produce alkali from sea salt (sodium chloride). In 1791, Nicolas Leblanc, physician to Louis Philip II, Duke of Orl√©ans, patented a solution. That same year he built the first Leblanc plant for the Duke at Saint-Denis, and this began to produce 320 tons of soda per year. He was denied his prize money because of the French Revolution. For more recent history, see industrial history below.  Chemistry  Reaction scheme of the Leblanc process (green = reactants, black = intermediates, red = products) In the first step, sodium chloride is treated with sulfuric acid in the Mannheim process. This reaction produces sodium sulfate (called the salt cake) and hydrogen chloride: : 2 NaCl + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 \\\\+ 2 HCl This chemical reaction had been discovered in 1772 by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. Leblanc's contribution was the second step, in which a mixture of the salt cake and crushed limestone (calcium carbonate) was reduced by heating with coal. This conversion entails two parts. First is the carbothermic reaction whereby the coal, a source of carbon, reduces the sulfate to sulfide: : Na2SO4 \\\\+ 2 C -> Na2S + 2 CO2 In the second stage, is the reaction to produce sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide. This mixture is called black ash. : Na2S + CaCO3 -> Na2CO3 \\\\+ CaS The soda ash is extracted from the black ash with water. Evaporation of this extract yields solid sodium carbonate. This extraction process was termed lixiviation.  Process detail  The sodium chloride is initially mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid and the mixture exposed to low heat. The hydrogen chloride gas bubbles off and was discarded to atmosphere before gas absorption towers were introduced. This continues until all that is left is a fused mass. This mass still contains enough chloride to contaminate the later stages of the process. The mass is then exposed to direct flame, which evaporates nearly all of the remaining chloride. The coal used in the next step must be low in nitrogen to avoid the formation of cyanide. The calcium carbonate, in the form of limestone or chalk, should be low in magnesia and silica. The weight ratio of the charge is 2:2:1 of salt cake, calcium carbonate, and carbon respectively. It is fired in a reverberatory furnace at about 1000 ¬∞C. Sometimes the reverberatory furnace rotated and thus was called a \\"revolver\\". The black-ash product of firing must be lixiviated right away to prevent oxidation of sulfides back to sulfate. In the lixiviation process, the black-ash is completely covered in water, again to prevent oxidation. To optimize the leaching of soluble material, the lixiviation is done in cascaded stages. That is, pure water is used on the black-ash that has already been through prior stages. The liquor from that stage is used to leach an earlier stage of the black-ash, and so on. The final liquor is treated by blowing carbon dioxide through it. This precipitates dissolved calcium and other impurities. It also volatilizes the sulfide, which is carried off as H2S gas. Any residual sulfide can be subsequently precipitated by adding zinc hydroxide. The liquor is separated from the precipitate and evaporated using waste heat from the reverberatory furnace. The resulting ash is then redissolved into concentrated solution in hot water. Solids that fail to dissolve are separated. The solution is then cooled to recrystallize nearly pure sodium carbonate decahydrate.  Industrial history  Leblanc established the first Leblanc process plant in 1791 in St. Denis. However, French Revolutionaries seized the plant, along with the rest of Louis Philip's estate, in 1794, and publicized Leblanc's trade secrets. Napoleon I returned the plant to Leblanc in 1801, but lacking the funds to repair it and compete against other soda works that had been established in the meantime, Leblanc committed suicide in 1806. By the early 19th century, French soda ash producers were making 10,000 - 15,000 tons annually. However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process became most widely practiced. The first British soda works using the Leblanc process was built by the Losh family of iron founders at the Losh, Wilson and Bell works in Walker on the River Tyne in 1816, but steep British tariffs on salt production hindered the economics of the Leblanc process and kept such operations on a small scale until 1824. Following the repeal of the salt tariff, the British soda industry grew dramatically. The Bonnington Chemical Works was possibly the earliest production, and the chemical works established by James Muspratt in Liverpool and Flint, and by Charles Tennant near Glasgow became some of the largest in the world. Muspratt's Liverpool works enjoyed proximity and transport links to the Cheshire salt mines, the St Helens coalfields and the North Wales and Derbyshire limestone quarries.Peter Reed, Acid Rain and the Rise of the Environmental Chemist in Nineteenth Century Britain, (2014), p. 94 By 1852, annual soda production had reached 140,000 tons in Britain and 45,000 tons in France. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.  Pollution issues  The Leblanc process plants were quite damaging to the local environment. The process of generating salt cake from salt and sulfuric acid released hydrochloric acid gas, and because this acid was industrially useless in the early 19th century, it was simply vented into the atmosphere. Also, an insoluble smelly solid waste was produced. For every 8 tons of soda ash, the process produced 5.5 tons of hydrogen chloride and 7 tons of calcium sulfide waste. This solid waste (known as galligu) had no economic value, and was piled in heaps and spread on fields near the soda works, where it weathered to release hydrogen sulfide, the toxic gas responsible for the odor of rotten eggs. Because of their noxious emissions, Leblanc soda works became targets of lawsuits and legislation. An 1839 suit against soda works alleged, \\"the gas from these manufactories is of such a deleterious nature as to blight everything within its influence, and is alike baneful to health and property. The herbage of the fields in their vicinity is scorched, the gardens neither yield fruit nor vegetables; many flourishing trees have lately become rotten naked sticks. Cattle and poultry droop and pine away. It tarnishes the furniture in our houses, and when we are exposed to it, which is of frequent occurrence, we are afflicted with coughs and pains in the head ... all of which we attribute to the Alkali works.\\" In 1863, the British Parliament passed the first of several Alkali Acts, the first modern air pollution legislation. This act allowed that no more than 5% of the hydrochloric acid produced by alkali plants could be vented to the atmosphere. To comply with the legislation, soda works passed the escaping hydrogen chloride gas up through a tower packed with charcoal, where it was absorbed by water flowing in the other direction. The chemical works usually dumped the resulting hydrochloric acid solution into nearby bodies of water, killing fish and other aquatic life. The Leblanc process also meant very unpleasant working conditions for the operators. It originally required careful operation and frequent operator interventions (some involving heavy manual labour) into processes giving off hot noxious chemicals.Russell. Colin Archibald, Chemistry, society and environment: a new history of the British chemical industry, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2000. Sometimes, workmen cleaning the reaction products out of the reverberatory furnace wore cloth mouth-and-nose gags to keep dust and aerosols out of the lungs.Described, and called a \\"gag\\", in a recorded commentary in the Catalyst chemical industry museum in Runcorn (Cheshire, England), to keep alkali dust out of workers' lungs in the early years of the chemical industry in Britain.https://3darchaeology.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2017/06/Volume-11-Issue-3.pdf (page 7) This improved somewhat later as processes were more heavily mechanised to improve economics and uniformity of product. By the 1880s, methods for converting the hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas for the manufacture of bleaching powder and for reclaiming the sulfur in the calcium sulfide waste had been discovered, but the Leblanc process remained more wasteful and more polluting than the Solvay process. The same is true when it is compared with the later electrolytical processes which eventually replaced it for chlorine production.  Obsolescence  In 1861, the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay developed a more direct process for producing soda ash from salt and limestone through the use of ammonia. The only waste product of this Solvay process was calcium chloride, and so it was both more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method. From the late 1870s, Solvay-based soda works on the European continent provided stiff competition in their home markets to the Leblanc- based British soda industry. Additionally the Brunner Mond Solvay plant which opened in 1874 at Winnington near Northwich provided fierce competition nationally. Leblanc producers were unable to compete with Solvay soda ash, and their soda ash production was effectively an adjunct to their still profitable production of chlorine, bleaching powder etc. (The unwanted by-products had become the profitable products). The development of electrolytic methods of chlorine production removed that source of profits as well, and there followed a decline moderated only by \\"gentlemen's' agreements\\" with Solvay producers.Reader W J Imperial Chemical Industries; A History Volume 1 The Forerunners 1870-1926 Oxford University Press 1970 SBN 19 215937 2 By 1900, 90% of the world's soda production was through the Solvay method, or on the North American continent, through the mining of trona, discovered in 1938, which caused the closure of the last North American Solvay plant in 1986. The last Leblanc-based soda ash plant closed in the early 1920s. However, because of solubility of the bicarbonate, the Solvay process does not work for the manufacture of potassium carbonate, and the Leblanc process continued in limited use for its manufacture until much later.  Biodiversity  There is a strong case for arguing that Leblanc process waste is the most endangered habitat in the UK, since the waste weathers down to calcium carbonate and produces a haven for plants that thrive in lime-rich soils, known as calcicoles. Only four such sites have survived the new millennium; three are protected as local nature reserves of which the largest, at Nob End near Bolton, is an SSSI and Local Nature Reserve - largely for its sparse orchid- calcicole flora, most unusual in an area with acid soils. This alkaline island contains within it an acid island, where acid boiler slag was deposited, which now shows up as a zone dominated by heather, Calluna vulgaris.Shaw, PJA & Halton W. (1998).

The band primarily consisted of vocalist Chrissy Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience. Originally a five-piece, the band underwent numerous line-up changes, with Amphlett and McEntee remaining as core members, before its dissolution in 1996. In May 2001, the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th-anniversary celebrations, named \\"Science Fiction\\" as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and in late 2007 Amphlett and McEntee reconvened to record a new single and begin working on a new album. The band played a short series of live gigs in Australia in late 2007 and early 2008. Divinyls broke up in 2009 and Amphlett died in 2013. In December 2018, McEntee announced he would be reforming the Divinyls for an Australian tour in early 2019, with Lauren Ruth Ward replacing Amphlett.Divinyls Reform for Australia Tour in 2019. The Rockpit, 3 December 2018. Retrieved 3 December 2018. On 6 February 2019, the tour was cancelled. Formation and albums Divinyls released five studio albums‚Äîfour placed in the Top 10 Australian chart, while one (Divinyls) reached No. 15 in the United States (US) and No. 33 for 3 weeks in Canada. Their biggest-selling single \\"I Touch Myself\\" (1990) achieved a No. 1 ranking in Australia, No. 4 in the United States, No. 10 in the United Kingdom (UK), and No. 13 in Canada. Amphlett was the cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon Patricia \\"Little Pattie\\" Amphlett, who had been married to Keith Jacobsen‚Äîyounger brother of pioneer rocker Col Joye and leading promoter Kevin Jacobsen. In her autobiography Pleasure and Pain (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for busking when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain. Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Air Supply) in the car park of a small music venue in Collaroy, Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the Sydney Opera House where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980. They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively, and for almost two years they performed in pubs and clubs in Sydney's Kings Cross. During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film Monkey Grip and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie. The group released two singles from the soundtrack, Music from Monkey Grip EP, \\"Boys in Town\\", which reached No. 8 on the national singles chart, and \\"Only Lonely\\". The band was the opening act at the 1983 US Festival. After the band's initial success, original manager and bassist Jeremy Paul left. He was replaced on bass, briefly by Ken Firth (ex-The Ferrets) and more permanently by Rick Grossman (ex-Matt Finish). Grossman left in 1987 to replace Clyde Bramley in Hoodoo Gurus. By early 1988, Divinyls consisted of Amphlett and McEntee with augmentation by additional musicians when recording or touring. Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, Music from Monkey Grip EP on WEA in 1982, Desperate on Chrysalis Records in 1983, What a Life! in 1985 and Temperamental in 1988. The latter two albums were also released by Chrysalis in the United States. They had hit singles in Australia with, \\"Science Fiction\\" No. 13 in 1983, \\"Good Die Young\\" No. 32 in 1984 and \\"Pleasure and Pain\\" which was written by Holly Knight and Mike Chapman and went No. 11 in 1985. Their later manager Vince Lovegrove organised Divinyls' transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of the United States. They established a fan base there, without achieving major commercial success. Divinyls also had Australian hits with cover versions of The Easybeats' \\"I'll Make You Happy\\", and Syndicate of Sound's \\"Hey Little Boy\\" (\\"Hey Little Girl\\" with the gender switched) which reached No. 25 in 1988. Amphlett became a controversial and highly visible celebrity for her brash, overtly sexual persona and subversive humour in lyrics, performances and media interviews. =Image transformation= At the start of their popularity, Divinyls were considered to be a hard rock band. At some point, many fans referred to Amphlett as the female Angus Young, as both had similar mannerisms on stage and wore black- and-white school uniforms while performing in the early 1980s. The band's image gradually changed after the release of the album What a Life! when the band began wearing elaborate clothing and producing more songs in the pop music genre. By the time of the release of their album Temperamental, Divinyls' image had changed to a glamour fashion style where they produced modern pop music. 1990s: Divinyls duo In 1991, Divinyls released diVINYLS on Virgin Records and the single \\"I Touch Myself\\" which became their only Australian No.1 single. The song reached No. 4 in the United States and No. 10 in the United Kingdom. The majority of Divinyls' hits were co-written by Amphlett and McEntee, but in this case they wrote with Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg. diVINYLS reached No. 5 on the Australian album charts and No. 15 on Billboard Top 200. The drummer for the diVINYLS sessions was Charley Drayton, who became romantically involved with Amphlett: they married in July 1999, and from 2000, lived together in New York. A disagreement with Virgin Records stifled future development outside Australia where they released popular albums and achieved two more top twenty singles with \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" No. 19 in 1992 and \\"I'm Jealous\\" No. 14 in 1995. During the 1980s and 1990s Amphlett collaborated as a songwriter with other artists including Chrissie Hynde and Cyndi Lauper, and both Amphlett and McEntee worked on solo projects. A live album, Divinyls Live, was released in 1991 but Divinyls did not provide another studio album for five years. In the early 1990s, they recorded a series of cover songs for various movie soundtracks, including the Young Rascals' \\"I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore\\" for Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992), the Wild Ones' \\"Wild Thing\\" for Reckless Kelly (1993), and Roxy Music's \\"Love Is the Drug\\" for Super Mario Brothers (1993). The song \\"I Touch Myself\\" caused such a controversy it had trouble getting airplay in many US-area markets; so much to the point that while performing their song live in Texas at Austin Aqua Fest 1991 the plug was pulled on the band mid-set by organisers. It wasn't until 1996 that their fifth studio album, Underworld, was released in Australia by BMG. Despite the success of diVINYLS, Virgin had not kept them under contract and BMG did not release Underworld in the United States. As with What a Life!, they worked with three producers, beginning with Peter Collins recording \\"I'm Jealous\\" in Nashville, followed by Keith Forsey for \\"Sex Will Keep Us Together\\" and \\"Heart of Steel\\". Although \\"Heart of Steel\\" was chosen as a single, Divinyls discontinued working with Forsey because according to Amphlett \\"he was a bit too 'pop' for us\\" and remaining tracks were produced by their drummer Drayton. By the end of 1996, Amphlett and McEntee had a falling out and separated without formally disbanding Divinyls. After the separation Following Underworld, Amphlett pursued a stage career. In 1998, she played the role of Judy Garland in the Australian stage production of the life story of entertainer Peter Allen, titled The Boy from Oz. The production was a success and Amphlett's interpretation of Garland, during her final troubled years, brought her critical acclaim: she was nominated for the Helpmann Award for 'Best Female Actor in a Musical'. Amphlett and McEntee concentrated on solo projects and collaborations with other artists. Amphlett and Drayton lived in New York City from 2000, while McEntee ran a clothing label, Wheels and Doll Baby, in Perth with his partner, Melanie Greensmith. In November 2005 Amphlett published her autobiography Pleasure and Pain: My Life co-written with Larry Writer; she detailed her achievements, drug and alcohol abuse, love affairs and triumphs while a member of Divinyls. 2006: Hall of Fame and reformation On 16 August 2006, Divinyls were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame and made their first performance for 10 years at the award ceremony. They reformed shortly afterwards and a compilation, Greatest Hits, was released by EMI Music Australia in August 2006. The band recorded four new songs via a satellite link: Amphlett and Drayton at Palm Studios in Las Vegas and McEntee in Perth. A single and B-side, \\"Don't Wanna Do This\\"/\\"Asphyxiated\\", was released in November 2007, with a third track, \\"All Pretty Things\\", released on a compilation album for the Homebake Festival. Amphlett stated that the band would return to the studio to record a full album provided they \\"survived\\" their Homebake headline gig and national tour. They performed during the Australian Idol grand final at the Sydney Opera House, on 25 November 2007, although their performance of \\"Boys in Town\\" (also performed by Idol winner Natalie Gauci) had to be repeated after Network Ten's transmission feed was interrupted. A national tour of Australia followed in December 2007 with a touring band featuring Drayton on drums, Jerome Smith on bass, Charlie Owen on guitar and newest member Clayton Doley on keyboards. Amphlett revealed on 7 December 2007 that she had multiple sclerosis in an interview with Richard Wilkins on Network Nine's A Current Affair‚Äînevertheless, she was looking forward to touring with Divinyls. The next day, Divinyls headlined the Homebake music festival where Amphlett displayed an emotional fragility when attempting to get the crowd to sing along with her. In August 2009, Amphlett announced that Divinyls were finished and she had a new band in New York. Death of Amphlett and abortive reformation Aged 53 years, Amphlett died on 21 April 2013 at her home in New York City after a protracted battle with breast cancer since 2010. Amphlett stated that she had been unable to receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy as treatment for the cancer due to her multiple sclerosis. Amphlett's cousin Patricia Thompson announced the news in an official public statement: \\"Our beloved Chrissy peacefully made her transition this morning. Christine Joy Amphlett succumbed to the effects of breast cancer and multiple sclerosis, diseases she vigorously fought with exceptional bravery and dignity.\\" In 2014, some of Australia's leading female artists came together to cover \\"I Touch Myself\\" to raise awareness and funds for breast cancer. In 2017, the band performed a one-off show in Perth with The Preatures' Isabella Manfredi and Jack Moffit joining as guests on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, respectively. McEntee, Grossman and Harvey completed the line-up. In December 2018, McEntee announced he would be reforming the group with new singer Lauren Ruth Ward, ex-Divinyls guitarist Frank Infante and a new rhythm section for an Australian tour, to begin in 2019. However, this announcement was criticised by Drayton and several fans as an \\"ultimate disrespect\\", with Drayton stating that anyone other than Amphlett who fronted the Divinyls should \\"seek some trustworthy advice\\".Divinyls Australian Tour 'Ultimate Disrespect' to Chrissy Amphlett. Nick Bond, news.com.au, 4 December 2018. Retrieved 4 December 2018. On 6 February 2019, the Australian tour was cancelled.

He is the lead guitarist, keyboardist and a founding member of Angels & Airwaves, appearing on every album except The Dream Walker (2014). Music career Kennedy was a member of Box Car Racer, a rock band formed by Blink-182 members Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker. Box Car Racer, then a side project to Blink-182, put out its only album in 2002. Kennedy was also a member of the hardcore groups Over My Dead Body from San Diego and Hazen Street from New York. With Angels & Airwaves he had released five albums. David and band member Tom DeLonge were close friends and grew up together in Poway, California. In 2014, Kennedy took a break from music to focus on his career with James Coffee Co, a San Diego-based coffee house of which he is a part owner that specializes in producing handcrafted artisan roasted coffee beans. On April 18, 2018, DeLonge announced on Instagram that Kennedy and bassist Matt Wachter had rejoined Angels & Airwaves and are set to appear on the next album. Instruments While playing with Angels & Airwaves, Kennedy was often seen playing his Gibson Memphis Custom Shop ES-335 Diamond Limited Run Electric Guitars, in all three colors in which they are available. He used Gibson Dirty Fingers Humbucking Pickups, the same bridge pickup Tom uses in all of his signature ES-333 models, in order to emulate Delonge's signature distorted, over driven tone when playing hand muted octave chords, often with delay effects. David played through Mesa Boogie triple rectifier heads and matching cabinets. Most of David's rig emulates that of DeLonge's, including the use of amps, preamp, cabs and effects, with the only exception being David's use of Ernie Ball Regular Slinky (10-46) strings as opposed to DeLonge's use of Ernie Ball Skinny Top, Heavy Bottom (10-52) strings. From 2010 to 2014, David used one Fender '65 Twin Reverb for clean, and one Vox AC30 for overdrive, matching Tom's setup once again. David had also used the Tom Delonge Signature Gibson ES-333 in some 2012 live performances and is seen with it in the Surrender music video. Motorcycle racing David Kennedy is known to have a love of motorcycles. In July 2009 he entered and won his first race at the Willow Springs Motorcycle Club. Afterwards Kennedy stated, > ‚ÄúI was nervous at the start, feeling just like I do before I go on stage to > play for a huge crowd. There's a lot to compare between playing on stage and > racing. Once the race started I just wanted to perform as best as I possibly > could. I always want to be the best at what I dedicate myself to doing. A > lot of people have helped me get to this point with my riding and I couldn't > let them down. So it felt as though my riding was a lot like doing a > performance.‚Äù He added that he wants to race as many tracks as he can. On October 19, David placed second in his second race at Willow Springs, and managed to break his placement streak on November 14 by once again taking first.

Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition, whereas pathophysiology seeks to explain the functional changes that are occurring within an individual due to a disease or pathologic state. History =Etymology= The term pathophysiology comes from the Ancient Greek œÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒøœÇ (pathos) and œÜœÖœÉŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ± (phusiologia). =Nineteenth century= Reductionism In Germany in the 1830s, Johannes M√ºller led the establishment of physiology research autonomous from medical research. In 1843, the Berlin Physical Society was founded in part to purge biology and medicine of vitalism, and in 1847 Hermann von Helmholtz, who joined the Society in 1845, published the paper \\"On the conservation of energy\\", highly influential to reduce physiology's research foundation to physical sciences. In the late 1850s, German anatomical pathologist Rudolf Virchow, a former student of M√ºller, directed focus to the cell, establishing cytology as the focus of physiological research, while Julius Cohnheim pioneered experimental pathology in medical schools' scientific laboratories. Germ theory By 1863, motivated by Louis Pasteur's report on fermentation to butyric acid, fellow Frenchman Casimir Davaine identified a microorganism as the crucial causal agent of the cattle disease anthrax, but its routinely vanishing from blood left other scientists inferring it a mere byproduct of putrefaction. In 1876, upon Ferdinand Cohn's report of a tiny spore stage of a bacterial species, the fellow German Robert Koch isolated Davaine's bacterides in pure culture ‚Äîa pivotal step that would establish bacteriology as a distinct discipline‚Äî identified a spore stage, applied Jakob Henle's postulates, and confirmed Davaine's conclusion, a major feat for experimental pathology. Pasteur and colleagues followed up with ecological investigations confirming its role in the natural environment via spores in soil. Also, as to sepsis, Davaine had injected rabbits with a highly diluted, tiny amount of putrid blood, duplicated disease, and used the term ferment of putrefaction, but it was unclear whether this referred as did Pasteur's term ferment to a microorganism or, as it did for many others, to a chemical.Bulloch, William, The History of Bacteriology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1938 & 1960 / New York: Dover Publications, 1979), p 143‚Äì144, 147-148 In 1878, Koch published Aetiology of Traumatic Infective Diseases, unlike any previous work, where in 80 pages Koch, as noted by an historian, \\"was able to show, in a manner practically conclusive, that a number of diseases, differing clinically, anatomically, and in aetiology, can be produced experimentally by the injection of putrid materials into animals.\\" Koch used bacteriology and the new staining methods with aniline dyes to identify particular microorganisms for each. Germ theory of disease crystallized the concept of cause‚Äîpresumably identifiable by scientific investigation. Scientific medicine The American physician William Welch trained in German pathology from 1876 to 1878, including under Cohnheim, and opened America's first scientific laboratory ‚Äîa pathology laboratory‚Äî at Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1878. Welch's course drew enrollment from students at other medical schools, which responded by opening their own pathology laboratories. Once appointed by Daniel Coit Gilman, upon advice by John Shaw Billings, as founding dean of the medical school of the newly forming Johns Hopkins University that Gilman, as its first president, was planning, Welch traveled again to Germany for training in Koch's bacteriology in 1883. Welch returned to America but moved to Baltimore, eager to overhaul American medicine, while blending Vichow's anatomical pathology, Cohnheim's experimental pathology, and Koch's bacteriology. Hopkins medical school, led by the \\"Four Horsemen\\" ‚ÄîWelch, William Osler, Howard Kelly, and William Halsted‚Äî opened at last in 1893 as America's first medical school devoted to teaching German scientific medicine, so called. =Twentieth century= Biomedicine The first biomedical institutes, Pasteur Institute and Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases, whose first directors were Pasteur and Koch, were founded in 1888 and 1891, respectively. America's first biomedical institute, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was founded in 1901 with Welch, nicknamed \\"dean of American medicine\\", as its scientific director, who appointed his former Hopkins student Simon Flexner as director of pathology and bacteriology laboratories. By way of World War I and World War II, Rockefeller Institute became the globe's leader in biomedical research. Molecular paradigm The 1918 pandemic triggered frenzied search for its cause, although most deaths were via lobar pneumonia, already attributed to pneumococcal invasion. In London, pathologist with the Ministry of Health, Fred Griffith in 1928 reported pneumococcal transformation from virulent to avirulent and between antigenic types ‚Äînearly a switch in species‚Äî challenging pneumonia's specific causation.\\"In the bacteriology of the 1920s, the conversion of the R to the S form could be regarded as an adaptation to the environment. However, the transformation of Type I to Type II was the equivalent of the transformation of one species into another, a phenomenon never before observed. Avery was initially skeptical of Griffith's findings and for some time refused to accept the validity of his claims, believing that they were the result of inadequate experimental controls. Avery's research on therapeutic sera led him to conclude that pneumococcal types were fixed and that specific therapeutic agents could thus be developed to combat the various types. A transformation from type to type in vivo presented a disturbing clinical picture, as well as a challenge to the theoretical formulations of contemporary bacteriology\\" [Oswald T Avery Collection, \\"Shifting focus: Early work on bacterial transformation, 1928-1940\\", Profiles in Science, US National Library of Medicine, Web: 24 Jan 2013].Dubos, Ren√© J, Oswald T Avery: His Life and Scientific Achievements (New York: Rockefeller University Press, 1976), pp 133, 135-136 The laboratory of Rockefeller Institute's Oswald Avery, America's leading pneumococcal expert, was so troubled by the report that they refused to attempt repetition.Dubos, Ren√©, \\"Memories of working in Oswald Avery's laboratory\\", Symposium Celebrating the Thirty-Fifth Anniversary of the Publication of \\"Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types\\", 2 Feb 1979 When Avery was away on summer vacation, Martin Dawson, British-Canadian, convinced that anything from England must be correct, repeated Griffith's results, then achieved transformation in vitro, too, opening it to precise investigation. Having returned, Avery kept a photo of Griffith on his desk while his researchers followed the trail. In 1944, Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty reported the transformation factor as DNA, widely doubted amid estimations that something must act with it. At the time of Griffith's report, it was unrecognized that bacteria even had genes. The first genetics, Mendelian genetics, began at 1900, yet inheritance of Mendelian traits was localized to chromosomes by 1903, thus chromosomal genetics. Biochemistry emerged in the same decade.Bechtel, William, Discovering Cell Mechanisms: The Creation of Modern Cell Biology (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005) In the 1940s, most scientists viewed the cell as a \\"sack of chemicals\\" ‚Äîa membrane containing only loose molecules in chaotic motion‚Äî and the only especial cell structures as chromosomes, which bacteria lack as such. Chromosomal DNA was presumed too simple, so genes were sought in chromosomal proteins. Yet in 1953, American biologist James Watson, British physicist Francis Crick, and British chemist Rosalind Franklin inferred DNA's molecular structure ‚Äîa double helix‚Äî and conjectured it to spell a code. In the early 1960s, Crick helped crack a genetic code in DNA, thus establishing molecular genetics. In the late 1930s, Rockefeller Foundation had spearheaded and funded the molecular biology research program ‚Äîseeking fundamental explanation of organisms and life‚Äî led largely by physicist Max Delbr√ºck at Caltech and Vanderbilt University.Kay, Lily, Molecular Vision of Life: Caltech, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of the New Biology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993) Yet the reality of organelles in cells was controversial amid unclear visualization with conventional light microscopy. Around 1940, largely via cancer research at Rockefeller Institute, cell biology emerged as a new discipline filling the vast gap between cytology and biochemistry by applying new technology ‚Äîultracentrifuge and electron microscope‚Äî to identify and deconstruct cell structures, functions, and mechanisms. The two new sciences interlaced, cell and molecular biology. Mindful of Griffith and Avery, Joshua Lederberg confirmed bacterial conjugation ‚Äîreported decades earlier but controversial‚Äî and was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. At Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York, Delbr√ºck and Salvador Luria led the Phage Group ‚Äîhosting Watson‚Äî discovering details of cell physiology by tracking changes to bacteria upon infection with their viruses, the process transduction. Lederberg led the opening of a genetics department at Stanford University's medical school, and facilitated greater communication between biologists and medical departments. Disease mechanisms In the 1950s, researches on rheumatic fever, a complication of streptococcal infections, revealed it was mediated by the host's own immune response, stirring investigation by pathologist Lewis Thomas that led to identification of enzymes released by the innate immune cells macrophages and that degrade host tissue. In the late 1970s, as president of Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center, Thomas collaborated with Lederberg, soon to become president of Rockefeller University, to redirect the funding focus of the US National Institutes of Health toward basic research into the mechanisms operating during disease processes, which at the time medical scientists were all but wholly ignorant of, as biologists had scarcely taken interest in disease mechanisms.Letter: Lewis Thomas (MSKCC) to Joshua Lederberg (Stanford Univ), 7 Aug 1978, p 1 Thomas became for American basic researchers a patron saint. =Examples= *The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease is death of dopaminergic neurons as a result of changes in biological activity in the brain with respect to Parkinson's disease (PD). There are several proposed mechanisms for neuronal death in PD; however, not all of them are well understood. Five proposed major mechanisms for neuronal death in Parkinson's Disease include protein aggregation in Lewy bodies, disruption of autophagy, changes in cell metabolism or mitochondrial function, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown resulting in vascular leakiness. *The pathophysiology of heart failure is a reduction in the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. As such, it can be caused by a wide number of conditions, including myocardial infarction (in which the heart muscle is starved of oxygen and dies), hypertension (which increases the force of contraction needed to pump blood) and amyloidosis (in which misfolded proteins are deposited in the heart muscle, causing it to stiffen). Over time these increases in workload will produce changes to the heart itself. *The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis is that of an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS in which activated immune cells invade the central nervous system and cause inflammation, neurodegeneration and tissue damage. The underlying condition that produces this behaviour is currently unknown. Current research in neuropathology, neuroimmunology, neurobiology, and neuroimaging, together with clinical neurology provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum *The pathophysiology of hypertension is that of a chronic disease characterized by elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension can be classified by cause as either essential (also known as primary or idiopathic) or secondary. About 90‚Äì95% of hypertension is essential hypertension. *The pathophysiology of HIV/AIDS involves, upon acquisition of the virus, that the virus replicates inside and kills T helper cells, which are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. There is an initial period of influenza-like illness, and then a latent, asymptomatic phase. When the CD4 lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/ml of blood, the HIV host has progressed to AIDS, a condition characterized by deficiency in cell-mediated immunity and the resulting increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain forms of cancer. *The pathophysiology of spider bites is due to the effect of its venom. A spider envenomation occurs whenever a spider injects venom into the skin. Not all spider bites inject venom ‚Äì a dry bite, and the amount of venom injected can vary based on the type of spider and the circumstances of the encounter. The mechanical injury from a spider bite is not a serious concern for humans. *The pathophysiology of obesity involves many possible pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its development and maintenance. This field of research had been almost unapproached until the leptin gene was discovered in 1994 by J. M. Friedman's laboratory. These investigators postulated that leptin was a satiety factor. In the ob/ob mouse, mutations in the leptin gene resulted in the obese phenotype opening the possibility of leptin therapy for human obesity. However, soon thereafter J. F. Caro's laboratory could not detect any mutations in the leptin gene in humans with obesity. On the contrary Leptin expression was increased proposing the possibility of Leptin-resistance in human obesity.

The ruins of the site are now located in the modern city Kerch. Early existence A coin from Panticapaeum, bearing a star inside a diadem and the letters \\"Œ†ŒëŒù\\", 2nd century BC. During the first centuries of the city's existence, imported Greek articles predominated: pottery (see Kerch Style), terracottas, and metal objects, probably from workshops in Rhodes, Corinth, Samos, and Athens. Local production, imitated from the models, was carried on at the same time. Athens manufactured a special type of bowl for the city, known as Kerch ware. Local potters imitated the Hellenistic bowls known as the Gnathia style as well as relief wares‚ÄîMegarian bowls.

Its economic decline in the 4th‚Äì3rd centuries BC was the result of the Sarmatian conquest of the steppes and the growing competition of Egyptian grain. =Mithridates= Small statue of Scythians with bows from Panticapeum, fourth century BC. The last of the Spartocids, Paerisades V, apparently left his realm to Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus. This transition was arranged by one of Mithridates's generals, Diophantus, who earlier had been sent to Taurica to help local Greek cities against Palacus of Lesser Scythia. The mission did not go smoothly: Paerisades was murdered by Scythians led by Saumacus, and Diophantus escaped to return later with reinforcements to suppress the revolt (c. 110 BC). Half of a century later, Mithridates took his life in Panticapaeum, when, after his defeat in a war against Rome, his son and heir Pharnaces and citizens of Panticapaeum turned against him.

At the age of eleven he was sent to Cheltenham College, an English boarding school which produced many army and navy officers.Redesdale (1913), p.vi Chamberlain grew up in a self-confident, optimistic Victorian atmosphere that celebrated the 19th century as the \\"Age of Progress\\"; a time of growing wealth, scientific discoveries, technological advances and democratic political reforms, a world that many Victorians only expected to get progressively better and better with Britain of course leading the way for the rest of the world.Field (1981), pp.20‚Äì21 Chamberlain grew up as a Liberal, and shared the general values of 19th-century British liberalism such as a faith in progress, of a world that could only get better, of the greatness of Britain as a liberal democratic and capitalist society.Field (1981), pp.23 & 27 Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, and felt lonely and out of place there.Field (1981), pp.24‚Äì25 The young Chamberlain was \\"a compulsive dreamer\\", more interested in the arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self.Mosse (1968), p.ix Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy.Field (1981), p.24 Chamberlain later recalled: \\"The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic ‚Äì for that is the only word which describes my feelings ‚Äì than any of the people around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship\\". = Embracing conservativism = During his youth, Chamberlain ‚Äì while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism ‚Äì became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of \\"Merry Old England\\", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class. The prospect of serving as an officer in India or elsewhere in the British Empire held no attraction for him. In addition, he was a delicate child with poor health. At the age of fourteen he had to be withdrawn from school. After Cheltenham, Chamberlain always felt out of place in Britain, a society whose values Chamberlain felt were not his values, writing in 1876: \\"The fact may be regrettable but it remains a fact; I have become so completely un-English that the mere thought of England and the English makes me unhappy\\".Field (1981), p.32 Chamberlain then travelled to various spas around Europe, accompanied by a Prussian tutor, Herr Otto Kuntze, who taught him German and interested him in German culture and history. Fascinated by Renaissance art and architecture, Chamberlain learned Italian and planned to settle in Florence for a time.Field (1981), pp.36‚Äì37 = University of Geneva and racial theory = Chamberlain then went to Geneva, where he studied under Carl Vogt (a supporter of racial typology at the University of Geneva),Bramwell, A., Blood and Soil ‚Äì Richard Walther Darr√© and Hitler's \\"Green Party\\", London, 1985, p. 206, Graebe, M√ºller Argoviensis, Thury, Plantamour, and other professors. He studied systematic botany, geology, astronomy, and later the anatomy and physiology of the human body.Redesdale (1913), p. vi  Botany dissertation: theory of vital force  Under the tutelage of Professor Julius von Wiesner of the University of Vienna, Chamberlain studied botany in Geneva, earning a Bacheliers en sciences (BSc) physiques et naturelles in 1881. His thesis, Recherches sur la s√®ve ascendante (Studies on rising sap), was not finished until 1897published by Attinger Fr√©res at Neuchatel the same year and did not culminate in a further qualification. The main thrust of Chamberlain's dissertation is that the vertical transport of fluids in vascular plants via xylem cannot be explained by the fluid mechanical theories of the time, but only by the existence of a \\"vital force\\" (force vitale) that is beyond the pale of physical measurement. He summarises his thesis in the Introduction: Physical arguments, in particular transpirational pull and root pressure, have since been shown to be adequate for explaining the ascent of sap.Tyree, Melvin T. and Zimmerman, Martin H. (2003). Xylem Structure and the Ascent of Sap (2nd ed.) Springer.  Still liberal: Accusing Disraeli for ruining England  During his time in Geneva, Chamberlain, who always despised Benjamin Disraeli, came to hate his country more and more, accusing the Prime Minister of taking British life down to what Chamberlain considered to be his extremely low level.Field (1981), p.353 During the early 1880s, Chamberlain was still a Liberal, \\"a man who approached issues from a firmly Gladstonian perspective and showed a marked antipathy to the philosophy and policies of British Conservatism\\".Field (1981), p.78 Chamberlain often expressed his disgust with Disraeli, \\"the man whom he blamed in large measure for the injection of selfish class interest and jingoism into British public life in the next decades\\".Field (1981), p.80 In 1881, he wrote to his family in Britain, praising William Ewart Gladstone for introducing the Land Bill to bring in \\"fair rents\\" in Ireland and withdrawing from the Transvaal.Field (1981), pp.78‚Äì80 An early sign of his anti-Semitism came in 1881 when he described the landlords in Ireland affected by the Land Bill as \\"blood-sucking Jews (sic)\\". The main landowning classes in Ireland then were Anglo-Irish gentiles, though at this stage of his life his anti-Semitic remarks were few and far between.Field (1981), p.79  Support of World Ice Theory  Chamberlain was an early supporter of Hanns H√∂rbiger's Welteislehre (\\"World Ice Theory\\"), the theory that most bodies in our solar system are covered with ice. Due in part to Chamberlain's advocacy, this became official cosmological dogma during the Third Reich.  Anti scientific claims  Chamberlain's attitude towards the natural sciences was somewhat ambivalent and contradictory ‚Äì he later wrote: \\"one of the most fatal errors of our time is that which impels us to give too great weight to the so- called 'results' of science.\\" Still, his scientific credentials were often cited by admirers to give weight to his political philosophy. Chamberlain rejected Darwinism, evolution and social Darwinism and instead emphasized \\"Gestalt\\" which he said derived from Goethe.see Harrington, Anne (1999) Reenchanted Science: Holism in German Culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. p.106 Wagnerite An ardent Francophile in his youth, Chamberlain had a marked preference for speaking French over English.Buruma (2000) p.219 It was only at the age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of Richard Wagner‚Äîwhich struck him with all the force of a religious revelation‚Äîthat Chamberlain became not only a Wagnerite, but an ardent Germanophile and Francophobe.Field (1981), pp.53‚Äì54 As he put later, it was then he realized the full \\"degeneracy\\" of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, who Chamberlain viewed as one of the great geniuses of all time. In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain finally found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had been unsuccessfully seeking to find in British and French cultures. Further increasing his love of Germany was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst, and she with him.Field (1981), p.33 As Chamberlain's wealthy, elitist family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst on the grounds that she was socially unsuitable for him, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money. By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic \\"land of love\\", a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity.Field (1981), pp.33‚Äì35 In 1883‚Äì1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker.Field (1981), pp.41‚Äì43. Chamberlain's attempts to play the Paris bourse ended in failure as he proved to be inept at business, and much of his hatred of capitalism stemmed from his time in Paris.Field (1981), pp.43‚Äì44 More happily for him, Chamberlain founded the first Wagner society in Paris and often contributed articles to the Revue wagn√©rienne, the first journal in France devoted to Wagner studies.Field (1981), pp.60‚Äì62 & 64‚Äì67 Together with his friend, the French writer √âdouard Dujardin, Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner's music.Field (1981), p.64 Thereafter he settled in Dresden, where \\"he plunged heart and soul into the mysterious depths of Wagnerian music and philosophy, the metaphysical works of the Master probably exercising as strong an influence upon him as the musical dramas\\". Chamberlain immersed himself in philosophical writings, and became a V√∂lkisch author, one of those concerned more with a highly racist understanding of art, culture, civilisation and spirit than with quantitative physical distinctions between groups.Bramwell, A. (1985) Blood and Soil ‚Äì Richard Walther Darr√© and Hitler's \\"Green Party\\", London. pp.23 & 40\\\\. This is evidenced by his huge treatise on Immanuel KantChamberlain, Houston Stewart (1905) Immanuel Kant: Die Pers√∂nlichkeit als Einf√ºhrung in das Werk. Bruckmann. with its comparisons. His knowledge of Friedrich Nietzsche is demonstrated in that work (p. 183) and in Foundations (p. 153n). It was during his time in Dresden that Chamberlain came to embrace v√∂lkisch thought through his study of Wagner, and from 1884 onwards, anti- Semitic and racist statements became the norm in his letters to his family in Britain.Field (1981), p.83 In 1888, Chamberlain wrote to his family proclaiming his joy at the death of the Emperor Friedrich III, a strong opponent of anti-Semitism whom Chamberlain called a \\"Jewish liberal\\", and rejoicing that his anti-Semitic son Wilhelm II was now on the throne.Field (1981), p.90 June 1888 was an auspicious month for Chamberlain. Besides the death of the \\"Jew-lover\\" Friedrich III, June 1888 also saw Chamberlain's first visit to the Wahnfried to meet Cosima Wagner, the reclusive leader of the Wagner cult.Biddiss (1998), p.80 Chamberlain later recalled that Cosima Wagner had \\"electrified\\" him as he felt the \\"deepest love\\" for Wagner's widow while Wagner wrote to a friend that she felt a \\"great friendship\\" with Chamberlain \\"because of his outstanding learning and dignified character\\".Field (1981), p.74 Wagner came to regard Chamberlain as her surrogate son.Field (1981), p.75 Under her influence, Chamberlain abandoned his previous belief that art was a separate entity from other fields and came to embrace the v√∂lkisch belief of the unity of race, art, nation and politics. Saxony was a center of v√∂lkisch activity in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, v√∂lkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats.Field (1981), p.89 Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was to a certain extent an outsider in his adopted country ‚Äì a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the kings), Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to v√∂lkisch politics.Field (1981), p.331 Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English \\"individualist\\" who \\"never saw Germany as it really is\\", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans.Field (1981), p.320 This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain.Field (1981), p.58 To compensate, Chamberlain became \\"√ºberdeutsch\\", the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans. By this time Chamberlain had met his first wife, the Prussian Anna Horst, whom he would divorce in 1905 after 28 years of marriage.Shirer (1959), p.105 Chamberlain was an admirer of Richard Wagner, and wrote several commentaries on his works including Notes sur Lohengrin (\\"Notes on Lohengrin\\") (1892), an analysis of Wagner's drama (1892), and a biography (1895), emphasising in particular the heroic Teutonic aspects in the composer's works. Stewart Spencer, writing in Wagner Remembered,London 2000 described Chamberlain's edition of Wagner letters as \\"one of the most egregious attempts in the history of musicology to misrepresent an artist by systematically censoring his correspondence\\". In particular, Wagner's lively sex life presented a problem for Chamberlain. Wagner had abandoned his first wife Minna, had an open affair with the married woman Mathilde Wesendonck and had started sleeping with his second wife Cosima while she was still married to her first husband.Field (1981), p.133 Chamberlain in his Wagner biography went to considerable lengths to distort the Master's love-life such as implying that Wagner's relationship with Cosima von B√ºlow only started after the death of her first husband. During his time in Dresden, Chamberlain like many other v√∂lkisch activists became fascinated with Hindu mythology and legend, and learned Sanskrit in order to read the ancient Indian epics like the Vedas and the Upanishads in their original form.Field (1981), p.304 In these stories about ancient Aryan heroes conquering the Indian subcontinent, Chamberlain found a very appealing world governed by a rigid caste system with social inferiors firmly locked into their place; full of larger-than-life Aryan gods and aristocratic heroes and a world that focused on the spiritual at the expense of the material. Since by this time, historians, archaeologists and linguists had all accepted that the Aryans (\\"light ones\\") of Hindu legend were an Indo-European people, Chamberlain had little trouble arguing that these Aryans were in fact Germanic peoples, and modern Germans had much to learn from Hinduism, stating \\"in the night of the inner life ... the Indian ... finds his way in the dark more surely than anyone\\". For Chamberlain the Hindu texts offered a body of pure Aryan thought that made it possible to find the harmony of humanity and nature, which provided the unity of thought, purpose and action that provided the necessary spirituality for Aryan peoples to find true happiness in a world being destroyed by a soulless materialism.Field (1981), pp.304‚Äì05 The popularity of the Hindu texts with the v√∂lkisch movement explains why the swastika, an ancient Indian symbol, was adopted by the v√∂lkisch activists as one of their symbols. Chamberlain in 1886 Champion of Wagnerism In 1889, he moved to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, influenced by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied in the works of Richard Wagner and the French racist writer Arthur de Gobineau.Chase, Allan (1977) The Legacy of Malthus: The Social Costs of the New Scientific Racism New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp.91‚Äì92 In his book Essai sur l'in√©galit√© des races humaines, the aristocratic Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners, had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standingBlue, Gregory (Spring 1999) \\"Gobineau on China: Race Theory, the \\"Yellow Peril\\" and the Critique of Modernity\\" Journal of World History, Volume 10, issue 1, p.99 as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends.Field (1981), p.152 Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst what was left of the \\"Aryan race\\", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans.Field (1981), pp.152‚Äì53 The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedl√§nder opined that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely \\"redemptive anti- semitism\\", a type of v√∂lkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of \\"redemption\\" for the anti- Semitic.Friedl√§nder (1998), p.87 Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von B√ºlow- Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von B√ºlow ‚Äì despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year he moved to Germany and became an important member of the \\"Bayreuth Circle\\" of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the message of racial hatred which he believed Wagner had advocated.Friedl√§nder (1998), p.89 Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s: > Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life > drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further > from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty > nothingness.Field (1981), p.150 In another letter, Chamberlain stated: > If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the > transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our > condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms > foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning‚Äîthat mankind must awaken > to a consciousness of its \\"pristine holy worth\\"‚Äîthen the Babylonian tower of > senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our > being forever. In Chamberlain's view, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the \\"redemptive anti-semitism\\" that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult. Vienna years In September 1891, Chamberlain visited Bosnia and Herzegovina as a journalist.Field (1981), p.98 In 1878, the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina had been occupied by Austria-Hungary; though the two provinces remained nominally Ottoman until 1908, in practice they were part of the Austrian empire from 1878 onwards. Because Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire, neither province was represented in the Austrian Reichsrat or the Hungarian Diet, and instead the two provinces were in practice a colony of Austria-Hungary. Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper. Chamberlain's articles about Bosnia reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for having utterly no democratic aspects to their rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina.Field (1981), p.100 Chamberlain wrote that what he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner's dictum: \\"Absolute monarch ‚Äì free people!\\" Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic \\"parliamentary regime\\", instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was best for them. Equally important in Chamberlain's Bosnian articles was his celebration of \\"natural man\\" who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society.Field (1981), p.101 At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages. Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the \\"westernization\\" being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia.Field (1981), pp.100‚Äì01 Chamberlain wrote about the average Bosnian: > [The Bosnian peasant] builds his house, he makes his shoes, and plough, etc; > the woman weaves and dyes the stuffs and cooks the food. When we have > civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful > costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have > ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when > contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner‚Äîthen Bosnia > will no longer be interesting to us. Chamberlain's awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature. In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the Middle Ages and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhythm of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal. Remembering Bosnia several years later, Chamberlain wrote: > The spirit of a natural man, who does everything and must create everything > for himself in life, is decidedly more universal and more harmoniously > developed than the spirit of an industrial worker whose whole life is > occupied with the manufacturing of a single object ‚Ä¶ and that only with the > aid of a complicated machine, whose functioning is quite foreign to him. A > similar degeneration is taking place amongst peasants: an American farmer in > the Far West is today only a kind of subordinate engine driver. Also among > us in Europe it becomes every day more impossible for a peasant to exist, > for agriculture must be carried out in \\"large units\\"‚Äîthe peasant > consequently becomes increasingly like an industrial worker. His > understanding dries up; there is no longer an interaction between his spirit > and surrounding Nature. Chamberlain's nostalgia for a pre-industrial way of life that he expressed so strongly in his Bosnia articles earned him ridicule, as many believed that he had an absurdly idealized and romanticized view of the rural life that he never experienced first-hand.Field (1981), p.102 In 1893, after receiving a letter from Cosima Wagner telling him that he had to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'in√©galit√© des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request.Biddiss (1998) p. 81 Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was \\"the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads\\".Buruma (2000), p. 220 Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909, when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the V√∂lkerchaos (chaos of the peoples).Field (1981), pp. 114‚Äì15 Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna may have been the first time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested.Field (1981), pp. 115‚Äì16 In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: \\"Unfortunately like everything else ... it has fallen into the hands of the Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness.\\"Field (1981), p.116 In 1895, he wrote: > However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold > to a Jew ... it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it ... > Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a > state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and > invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do > classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was \\"one of the most acute minds of the century\\" and \\"I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon.\\"Field (1981), p. 81 At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart, as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating.Field (1981), pp. 332‚Äì33 Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.Field (1981), p.334 Though Chamberlain was always very supportive of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894‚Äì96: > The Armenian insurrection [of 1894] with the inevitable retaliation of > massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those > greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English > journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics > required a \\"diversion\\". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: > The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the > most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; > it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always > speaking as if it were umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all > round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the > most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England > hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an > English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened‚ÄîNo other > nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for > peace‚ÄîEngland alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all > sides.Field (1981), pp. 355‚Äì56 During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: > We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, > money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands > in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and > Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal > coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions > and acts is in direct contradiction.Field (1981), p. 356 At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly, and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other at a time when he believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged \\"Yellow Peril\\".Field (1981), p. 357 In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: > One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and > Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated > reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and > threatens destruction ... The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely > untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united > empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome‚Äîand has it been > overcome?‚Äîby sending out an army superior in number to the whole population > including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond > anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not > remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been > subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners.Field (1981), pp. 357‚Äì58 Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: \\"This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing I have experienced which is comparable to it.\\" As a leading Wagnerite in Vienna, Chamberlain befriended a number of other prominent Wagnerites, such as Prince Hohenhohe-Langenburg, Ludwig Schemann, Georg Meurer, and Baron Christian von Ehrenfels.Field (1981), p. 128 The most important friendship that Chamberlain made during his time in Vienna was with German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Prince Philip von Eulenburg, who shared Chamberlain's love of Wagnerian music. Besides being a passionate Wagnerite, Eulenburg was also an anti-Semite, an Anglophobe and a convinced enemy of democracy who found much to admire in Chamberlain's anti- Semitic, anti-British and anti-democratic writings.Buruma (2000) p. 218 Die Grundlagen (The Foundations) In February 1896, the Munich publisher Hugo Bruckmann, a leading v√∂lkisch activist who was later to publish Mein Kampf commissioned Chamberlain to write a book that was intended to summarize all of the achievements of the 19th century.Field (1981), pp.169‚Äì70; Lobenstein- Reichmann (2008), 21-22 In October 1899 Chamberlain published his most famous work, Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, in German. The Foundations is a pseudo-scientific \\"racial history\\" of humanity from the emergence of the first civilizations in the ancient Near East to the year 1800. It argues that all of the \\"foundations\\" of the great 19th century, which saw huge economic, scientific and technological advances in the West, were the work of the \\"Aryan race\\".Field (1981), p.180 Die Grundlagen was only the first volume of an intended three-volume history of the West with the second and third volumes taking up the story of the West in the 19th century and the looming war for world domination in the coming 20th century between the Aryans on one side vs. the Jews, blacks and Asians on the other side.Field (1981), pp.171‚Äì72 Chamberlain never wrote the second or third volumes, much to the intense annoyance of Cosima Wagner, who was upset that Die Grundlagen stopped in 1800 before Wagner was born, and thus gave her late husband short shrift.Field (1981), pp.343‚Äì45 The book argued that Western civilisation is deeply marked by the influence of Teutonic peoples. = Races defined as Aryan = Chamberlain grouped all European peoples ‚Äì not just Germans, but Celts, Slavs, Greeks, and Latins ‚Äì into the \\"Aryan race\\", a race built on the ancient Proto- Indo-European culture. In fact he even included the Berber people of North Africa in the Aryan race: \\"The noble Moor of Spain is anything but a pure Arab of the desert, he is half a Berber (from the Aryan family) and his veins are so full of Gothic blood that even at the present day noble inhabitants of Morocco can trace their descent back to Teutonic ancestors.\\"Chamberlain, Houston Stewart Chamberlain (2005) [1899] The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century. Adamant Media Corporation. p.398. chap.5 At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, according to Chamberlain, were the Germanic or Teutonic peoples, who had best preserved the Aryan blood.Field (1981), p.223 Chamberlain used the terms Aryan, Indo-European and Indo-Germanic interchangeably, but he went out of his way to emphasise that purest Aryans were to be found in Central Europe and that in both France and Russia miscegenation had diluted the Aryan blood.Field (1981), p.191 The Russians in particular had become a semi-Asian people on the account of the rule of the Golden Horde. Much of Chamberlain's theory about the superiority of the Aryan race was taken from the writings of the French aristocrat Arthur de Gobineau, but there was a crucial difference in that Gobineau had used the Aryan race theory as a way of dividing society between an Aryan nobility vs. racially inferior commoners whereas Chamberlain used the Aryan racial theory as a way of uniting society around its supposed common racial origins.Field (1981), pp.223‚Äì24 = Aryan race virtues = Everything that Chamberlain viewed as good in the world was ascribed to the Aryans. Lobenstein-Reichmann (2008), pp. 175-185 For an example, in The Foundations Chamberlain explained at considerable length that Jesus Christ could not possibly be a Jew, and very strongly implied that Christ was an Aryan.Field (1981), p.183 Chamberlain's tendency to see everything good as the work of the Aryans allowed him to claim whoever he approved of for the Aryan race, which at least was part of the appeal of the book in Germany when it was published in 1899. Chamberlain claimed all of the glories and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome as due entirely to Aryan blood, which supposedly flowed in the veins of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Chamberlain wrote that ancient Greece was a \\"lost ideal\\" of beautiful thought and art that the modern Germans were best placed to recover if only the German people could embrace Wagner.Field (1981), pp.180‚Äì81 Chamberlain praised Rome for its militarism, civic values, patriotism, respect for the law and reverence for the family as offering the best sort of Aryan government.Field (1981), p.182 Reflecting his opposition to feminism, Chamberlain lamented how modern women were not like the submissive women of ancient Rome whom he claimed were most happy in obeying the wills of their husbands. Chamberlain asserted that Aryans and Aryans alone are the only people in the entire world capable of creating beautiful art and thinking great thoughts, so he claimed all of the great artists, writers and thinkers of the West such as Homer, Dante, Giotto, Donatello, Albrecht D√ºrer, Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther, William Shakespeare, Rembrandt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as part of one long glorious tradition of beautiful Aryan art and thought, which Chamberlain planned to have culminate with the life-changing, racially regenerating music of Richard Wagner in the 19th century.Field (1981), pp.196‚Äì98 As the British historian George Peabody Gooch wrote, here was \\"a glittering vision of mind and muscle, of large scale organization, of intoxicating self-confidence, of metallic brilliancy, such as Europe has never seen\\".Field (1981), p.196 The antithesis of the heroic Aryan race with its vital, creative life-improving qualities was the \\"Jewish race\\", whom Chamberlain presented as the inverse of the Aryan Lobenstein-Reichmann (2008), pp. 186-217. Every positive quality the Aryans had, the Jews had the exact opposing negative quality.Field (1981), pp.190‚Äì91 & 195 The American historian Geoffrey Field wrote: > To each negative \\"Semitic\\" trait Chamberlain counter-posed a Teutonic > virtue. Kantian moral freedom took the place of political liberty and > egalitarianism. Irresponsible Jewish capitalism was sharply distinguished > from the vague ideal of Teutonic industrialism, a romantic vision of an > advanced technological society which had somehow managed to retain the > Volksgemeinschaft, cooperation and hierarchy of the medieval guilds. The > alternative to Marxism was \\"ethical socialism\\", such as that described by > Thomas More, \\"one of the most exquisite scholars ever produced by a Teutonic > people, of an absolutely aristocratic, refined nature\\". In the rigidly > elitist, disciplined society of Utopia with its strong aura of Christian > humanism, Chamberlain found an approximation of his own nostalgic, communal > ideal. \\"The gulf separating More from Marx,\\" he wrote, \\"is not the progress > of time, but the contrast between Teuton and Jew.\\"Field (1981), p.195 = The Jewish wars claim = Chamberlain announced in The Foundations that \\"all the wars\\" in history were \\"so peculiarly connected with Jewish financial operations\\".Field (1981) p.190 Chamberlain warned that the aim of the Jew was \\"to put his foot upon the neck of all nations of the world and be Lord and possessor of the whole earth\\".Field (1981), p.189 As part of their plans to destroy Aryan civilization, Chamberlain wrote: \\"Consider, with what mastery they use the law of blood to extend their power.\\" Chamberlain wrote that Jewish women were encouraged to marry Gentiles while Jewish men were not, so the male line \\"remained spotless ... thousands of side-branches are cut off and employed to infect Indo-Europeans with Jewish blood.\\" In his account of the Punic wars between \\"Aryan Rome\\" and \\"Semitic Carthage\\", Chamberlain praised the Romans for their total destruction of Carthage in 146 BC at the end of the Third Punic War as an example of how Aryans should deal with Semites. Later, Chamberlain argued that the Romans had become too tolerant of Semites like the Jews, and this was the cause of the downfall of the Roman empire.Field (1981), p.182 Chamberlain argued that it was due to miscegenation that the Jews had caused the Aryan Roman Empire to go into decline and collapse. Chamberlain wrote that the \\"African half breed soldier emperor\\" Caracalla had granted Roman citizenship to all the subjects in the Empire regardless of race or religion in 212 AD, and as result of this, the Romans had freely mixed with Semitic and African peoples, leading Chamberlain to conclude: \\"Like a cataract the alien blood poured down into the depopulated city of Rome and soon the Romans ceased to exist.\\" As such, the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the Germanic peoples was merely an act of liberation from the V√∂lkerchaos (\\"Chaos of the Peoples\\") that the Roman empire had become.Field (1981), p. 184. = Theories of Jewish conspiracy =  Jewish race domination claim  The ultimate aim of the Jew, according to Chamberlain, was to create a situation were \\"there would be in Europe only a single people of pure race, the Jews, all the rest would be a herd of pseudo- Hebraic mestizos, a people beyond all doubt degenerate physically, mentally and morally.\\"  Catholicism a Jewish invention  As part of their plans to destroy the Aryans, Chamberlain claimed that the Jews had founded the Roman Catholic Church, which only preached a \\"Judaized\\" Christianity that had nothing to do with the Christianity created by the Aryan Christ.Field (1981), p.192 At least some historians have argued that The Foundations are actually more anti-Catholic than anti-Semitic, but this misses the point that the reason why Chamberlain attacked the Catholic Church so fiercely was because he believed the Papacy was controlled by the Jews. Chamberlain claimed that in the 16th century the Aryan Germans under the leadership of Martin Luther had broken away from the corrupt influence of Rome, and so laid the foundations of a \\"Germanic Christianity\\".Field (1981), p. 194  Democracy a failed Jewish invention  Chamberlain claimed that the natural and best form of government for Aryans was a dictatorship, and so he blamed the Jews for inventing democracy as part of their plans for destroying the Aryans. In the same way, Chamberlain blamed capitalism ‚Äì which he saw as a very destructive economic system ‚Äì as something invented by the Jews to enrich themselves at the expense of the Aryans while at the same time crediting the Jews with inventing socialism with its message of universal human equality as a cunning Jewish stratagem to divert attention away from all the economic devastation wrought by Jewish financiers.  Jewish fault for Chinese lack of culture  Chamberlain's relentless determination to prove that everything he viewed as evil in the world as the work of the Jews led him to some odd conclusions. Chamberlain had a deep dislike of the Chinese, and so in The Foundations he announced that Chinese civilization had been founded by the Jews because just like the Jews the Chinese had \\"... the total absence of all culture and the one-sided emphasizing of civilization\\".Field (1981), p. 193 For Chamberlain, this was more than sufficient proof that the Jews had created Chinese civilization. = Jewish race - not religion = The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedl√§nder described The Foundations ‚Äì with its theory of two \\"pure\\" races left in the world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other ‚Äì as one of the key texts of \\"redemptive anti-semitism\\". Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a \\"solution\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\", stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews.Field (1981), p. 311 In taking this stance, Chamberlain was going beyond his hero Wagner. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma wrote: > Wagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it > with his customary charm, \\"annihilate\\" his Jewishness by repudiating his > ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory > a Jew could be a German ‚Ä¶ But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, > who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation > could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the > national bloodstream. The more a Jew took on the habits and thoughts of his > gentile compatriots, the more he was to be feared.Buruma (2000) p. 167 = Leaving \\"the solution\\" to the reader = Chamberlain did not advocate the extermination of Jews in The Foundations; indeed, despite his determination to blame all of the world's problems on the Jews, Chamberlain never proposed a solution to this perceived problem.Field (1981), p. 222 Instead, Chamberlain made the cryptic statement that after reading his book, his readers would know best about how to devise a \\"solution\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\". Friedl√§nder has argued that if one were to seriously take up the theories of \\"redemptive anti-semitism\\" proposed in The Foundations, and push them to their logical conclusion, then inevitably one would reach the conclusion that genocide might be a perfectly acceptable \\"solution\\" to the \\"Jewish Question\\". Friedl√§nder argued that there is an implied genocidal logic to The Foundations as Chamberlain argued that Jews were a race apart from the rest of humanity; that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and so the Jews were born evil and remained evil until they died, indeed a Jew could never stop being evil even if he or she wanted to; and that for these biological reasons alone, the Jews would never cease their endless attempts to destroy all that was good within the world.  Follow up book by Josef Remier  Inspired by The Foundations, one v√∂lkisch writer, Josef Remier, published Ein Pangermanisches Deutschland (\\"A Pan-Germanic Germany\\") in 1905, which used The Foundations to advocate that Germany conquer the Russian Empire, after which special commissions of doctors, anthropologists and \\"breeding experts\\" were to divide the population into three categories; ethnic Germans, those capable of being \\"Germanized\\", and those incapable of \\"improvement\\", with all Slavs and Jews being included in the last category.Field (1981), p. 230 Field wrote that Remier's vision anticipated the \\"war of extermination\\" that was Operation Barbarossa in 1941 in \\"many horrifying aspects\\". = 'The Foundations' sales, reviews and acceptance = The Foundations sold well: eight editions and 60,000 copies within 10 years, 100,000 copies by the outbreak of World War I and 24 editions and more than a quarter of a million copies by 1938.Shirer (1959), p. 107 The success of The Foundations after it was published in October 1899 made Chamberlain into a celebrity intellectual.Field (1981), p. 227 The popularity of The Foundations was such that many Gymnasium (high school) teachers in the Protestant parts of Germany made Die Grundlagen required reading for their students.Field (1981), p. 232 One teacher remembered: \\"I myself read the whole book in one go when as a young Gymnasium teacher in N√ºrnberg it fell into my hands. And with a flushed face I put it aside full of excitement. I can picture the scene today [1927] and can reawaken the old feeling.\\"Field (1981), p. 132 The book sold very well, but reviews in Germany were very mixed. Conservative and National Liberal newspapers gave generally friendly reviews to The Foundations.Field (1981), pp. 228‚Äì29 V√∂lkisch newspapers gave overwhelming positive reviews to The Foundations with many v√∂lkisch reviewers calling Die Grundlagen one of the greatest books ever written.Field (1981), pp. 229‚Äì30 = Discrimination of Jews following the book = German universities were hotbeds of v√∂lkisch activity in the early 20th century, and The Foundations was extremely popular on university campuses with many university clubs using The Foundations as a reason to exclude Jewish students from joining.Field (1981), pp. 231‚Äì32 Likewise, military schools were centers of v√∂lkisch thought in the early 20th century, and so The Foundations was very popular with officer cadets; though since neither the Navy nor the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and W√ºrttemberg armies accepted Jewish officer candidates, Die Grundlagen did not lead to Jews being excluded. The only exceptions to the otherwise total exclusion of German Jews from the officer corps were the Bavarian and Saxon armies, which were prepared to accept Jews as reserve officers.Wette (2006), p. 33 Liberal and Social Democratic newspapers gave the book extremely poor reviews with reviewers complaining of an irrational way of reasoning in The Foundations, noting that Chamberlain quoted the writings of Goethe out of context in order to give him views that he had not held, and that the entire book was full of an obsessive anti-Semitism which they found extremely off-putting.Field (1981), pp. 227‚Äì28 = Catholic and Protestant responses = Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic newspapers all published very hostile reviews of The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen for its anti-Semitism.Field (1981), pp. 235‚Äì36 Protestant v√∂lkisch newspapers gave The Foundations very good reviews, while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's call for a racialized Christianity.Field (1981), pp. 236‚Äì37 One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena, wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude that it was no surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament.Field (1981), p. 236 = Jewish response = One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer- Cohn, wrote that The Foundations was \\"bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning\\".Field (1981), p. 231 German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsb√ºrger j√ºdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence.Field (1981), pp. 245‚Äì47 The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, and one of the reasons for that belief was: \\"Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would still like to know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?\\" Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of \\"the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon they speak of Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred\\". Portrait by Franz von Lenbach, c. 1902 Evangelist of Race = Visit to England and attack on its Jews = In 1900, for the first time in decades, Chamberlain visited Britain, a place he disparagingly called \\"the land of the Boer-eaters\\".Field (1981), p. 359 Writing to Cosima Wagner from London, Chamberlain stated sadly that his Britain, the Britain of aristocratic rule, hard work and manly courage, the romanticized \\"Merry Old England\\" of his imagination was no more; it had been replaced by what Chamberlain saw as a materialist, soulless society, atomized into individuals with no sense of the collective purpose and entirely dominated by greed.Field (1981), p. 358 Chamberlain wrote that since the 1880s Britain had \\"chosen the service of Mammon\\", for which he blamed the Jews, writing to Wagner: \\"This is the result, when one has studied politics with a Jew for a quarter century.\\" The \\"Jew\\" Chamberlain was referring to was Disraeli, whom Chamberlain had always hated with a passion. Chamberlain concluded: \\"My old England was nowhere recognizable.\\" Chamberlain declared in his letter that all British businessmen were now dishonest; the middle class, smug and stupid; small farmers and shops were no longer able to compete with Jewish-owned big business; and the monarchy was \\"irretrievably weakened\\" by social change. In short, for Chamberlain Britain was no longer his country. = German superiority to rule the world = In the summer of 1900, Chamberlain wrote an essay in the magazine Jugend, where he declared that: \\"The reign of Wilhelm II has the character of the dawning of a new day.\\"R√∂hl (2004), p. 1040 Chamberlain went on to write that Wilhelm was \\"in fact the first German Kaiser\\" who knew his mission was to \\"ennoble\\" the world by spreading \\"German knowledge, German philosophy, German art and‚Äîif God wills‚ÄîGerman religion. Only a Kaiser who undertakes this task is a true Kaiser of the German people.\\"R√∂hl (2004), pp. 1040‚Äì41 To allow Germany to become a world power, Chamberlain called for the Reich to become the world's greatest sea power, as Chamberlain asserted that whatever power rules the seas also rules the world.R√∂hl (2004), p. 1041 Chamberlain wrote that \\"without a fleet nothing can be done. But equipped with a great fleet, Germany is embarking on the course to which Cromwell showed England the way, and she can and must steer resolutely towards the goal of becoming the first power in the world. She has the moral justification for it and therefore also the duty.\\" = Kaiser Wilhelm II = In early 1901, the German Emperor Wilhelm II read The Foundations and was immensely impressed with the book.Field (1981), p. 249 The Imperial Grand Chamberlain at the court, Ulrich von B√ºlow, the brother of the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow, wrote in a letter to a friend in January 1901 that the Kaiser was \\"studying the book a second time page by page\\". In November 1901, Chamberlain's friend, the German diplomat and courtier Prince Philip von Eulenburg, who happened to be the best friend of Wilhelm II, introduced Chamberlain to the Kaiser. Chamberlain and Wilhelm first met at Eulenburg's estate at Liebenberg and soon became very good friends, maintaining a regular correspondence which continued until Chamberlain's death in 1927. To reach Liebenberg from Vienna, Chamberlain had first to take a train to Berlin, and then board another train to Liebenberg. Chamberlain's meeting with the Kaiser was considered so important that when Chamberlain reached Berlin, he was met by the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow, who joined him on the trip to Liebenberg. During the train ride, B√ºlow and Chamberlain had a long discussion about The Foundations and then French literature. Upon reaching the gates of Liebenberg in the evening, Chamberlain and B√ºlow were met by Wilhelm and Eulenburg who were surrounded by servants carrying torches.Field (1981), p. 250 When he met Chamberlain for the first time, Wilhelm told him: \\"I thank you for what you have done for Germany!\\" The next day, Eulenburg wrote to a friend that the Emperor \\"stood completely under the spell of this man [Chamberlain], whom he understood better than any of the other guests because of his thorough study of The Foundations\\". Until Chamberlain's death, he and Wilhelm had what the American historian Geoffrey Field called \\"a warm, personal bond\\", which was expressed in a series of \\"... elaborate, wordy letters, full of mutual admiration and half-baked ideas\\". The Wilhelm‚ÄìChamberlain letters were full of \\"the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism\\". They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the \\"destructive poison\\" of Judentum were favorite themes.Field (1981), pp. 250‚Äì51 Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the Reich by the \\"Yellow Peril\\", \\"Tartarized Slavdom\\", and the \\"black hordes\\".Field (1981), p. 252 In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: \\"God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent you personally to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction.\\"R√∂hl (2004), p. 205 Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his \\"comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc.\\" In 1902, Wilhelm wrote another letter in which he told Chamberlain: \\"May you save our German Volk, our Germanentum, for God has sent you as our helper!\\" Chamberlain in his turn advised Wilhelm to create \\"a racially aware ... centrally organised Germany with a clear sense of purpose, a Germany which would 'rule the world'\\". In 1903, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm to claim that as in the last decadent days of Rome, \\"the civis britannicus is now become a purely political concept\\" with no racial content being involved.Buruma (2000) p.221 Chamberlain wrote with disgust how for two shillings and a sixpence, \\"every Basuto nigger\\" could now carry a British passport. Chamberlain went on to predict within the next fifty years \\"the English aristocracy will be nothing but a money oligarchy, without a shred of racial solidarity or relation to the throne.\\" Chamberlain went on to deplore the practice of raising businessmen to the peerage in Britain, contemptuously declaring that in Britain mere \\"brewers, ink manufacturers and ship-owners\\" now sat in the House of Lords. Chamberlain ended his letter to the Kaiser by calling the general British public \\"a herd which has no will and which a few newspapers and handful of politicians manipulate as they wish\\". Wilhelm's later concept of \\"Juda-England\\", of a decaying Britain sucked dried by Jewish capitalists, owed much to Chamberlain. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain's letters to the Kaiser as pushing his \\"... Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy\\". The liberal Berliner Zeitung newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite as Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.Field (1981), p. 251 = Admiring England and loathing it = For Wilhelm, all pride about being German had a certain ambivalence, as he was in fact half-British.Buruma (2000) pp. 210‚Äì11 In an age of ultra-nationalism with identities being increasingly defined in racial terms, his mixed heritage imposed considerable psychological strain on Wilhelm, who managed at one and the same time to be both an Anglophile and Anglophobe; he was a man who both loved and hated the British, and his writings about the land of his mother displayed both extreme admiration and loathing. Buruma observed that for all his much-vaunted beliefs in public about the superiority of everything German, in private Wilhelm often displayed signs of an inferiority complex to the British, as if he really felt deep down that it was Britain, not Germany, that was the world's greatest country. For Wilhelm, someone like Chamberlain, the Englishman who came to Germany to praise the Fatherland as the world's greatest nation, and who had \\"scientifically\\" proven that \\"fact\\" in The Foundations, was a \\"dream come true\\" for him.Buruma (2000) pp. 219‚Äì20 Writing about the Chamberlain-Wilhelm relationship, Field stated: > Chamberlain helped place Wilhelm's tangled and vaguely formulated fears of > Pan Slavism, the black and yellow \\"hordes\\", Jews, Ultramontanes, Social > Democrats, and free-thinkers to a global and historical framework copiously > footnoted and sustained by a vast array of erudite information. He elevated > the Emperor's dream of a German mission into an elaborate vision of divinely > ordained, racial destiny. The lack of precision, the muddle, and logical > flaws that are so apparent to modern readers of The Foundations did not > bother Wilhelm: he eagerly submitted to its subjective, irrational style of > reasoning. ... And if the Kaiser was a Prussian with an ingrained respect > for English values and habits, Chamberlain was just as much an Englishman > who was deeply ambivalent about his own birthplace and who revered German > qualities and Prussian society. Almost unconsciously, as his vast > correspondence shows, he adopted an obsequious, scraping tone when > addressing the lowliest of Prussian army officers. If Wilhelm was drawn to > the very Englishness of Chamberlain, the author of The Foundations saw in > the Hohenzollern prince‚Äîat least until the World War‚Äîthe very symbol of his > idealized Deutschtum.Field (1981), pp. 254 & 261 Chamberlain, who in the words of Buruma was \\"an English fetishist of German blood\\" who wrote long pseudo-scientific articles about how \\"Germanic racial genius\\" manifested itself in the cultural works of Richard Wagner, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Ludwig van Beethoven, and William Shakespeare (Chamberlain considered Shakespeare to be a \\"Germanic playwright\\" who properly belonged to Germany), was the \\"perfect match\\" for Wilhelm. Chamberlain frequently wrote to an appreciative and admiring Wilhelm telling him that it was only the noble \\"German spirit\\" which was saving the world from being destroyed by a \\"deracinated Yankee-Anglo-Jewish materialism\\".Buruma (1998), p. 219 Finally, Wilhelm was also a Wagnerite and found much to admire in Chamberlain's writings praising Wagner's music as a mystical, spiritual life- force that embodied all that was great about the \\"German spirit\\". = 'The Foundations' book success = The success of The Foundations made Chamberlain famous all over the world. In 1906, the Brazilian intellectual S√≠lvio Romero cited Chamberlain together with Otto Ammon, Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Arthur de Gobineau as having proved that the blond \\"dolichocephalic\\" people of northern Europe were the best and greatest race in the entire world, and urged that Brazil could become a great nation by a huge influx of German immigrants who would achieve the embranquecimento (whitening) of Brazil.Skidmore, Thomas (1993) Black Into White: Race and Nationality in Brazilian Thought, Durnham: Duke University Press. p. 56 Chamberlain received invitations to lecture on his racial theories at Yale and Johns Hopkins universities, but turned them down on the grounds that he had no wish to visit what he viewed as a culturally and spiritually debased nation like the United States.  Not family with Joseph and Neville Chamberlain  When the book was first published, reviewers often asked who this Chamberlain was, and there was much fevered speculation in the German press as to whether Chamberlain was related to Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary who, as the principal author of the British forward policy in South Africa, was one of the most detested men in the Reich. Several German magazines mistakenly printed pictures of Joseph Chamberlain's sons, Austen Chamberlain and Neville Chamberlain, identifying them as the author of The Foundations. Many Germans breathed a collective sigh of relief when it was subsequently established that Houston Stewart Chamberlain was not related to the famous Chamberlain family of Birmingham. = The Chamberlain circle = After the success of The Foundations, a Chamberlain Kreis (circle) appeared in Vienna that comprised the Indologist Leopold von Schroeder, Count Ulrich von B√ºlow; Countess Melanie Metternich-Zichy, Countess Marietta von Coundenhove, Baroness Emma von Ehrenfels, the music critic and Wagnerite Gustav Schonaich, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Count Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Kassner who met weekly at Chamberlain's home to discuss his racial theories.Field (1981), p. 321 = Personal life and financials = It was during this period that Chamberlain had an affair with Baroness von Ehrenfels, the wife of his friend Baron Christian von Ehrenfels and another affair with a Viennese showgirl, Lili Petri.Field (1981), p. 348 In 1906, his marriage to Anna ended in divorce.Field (1981), p. 336 Besides the income from sales of The Foundations and the essays he was constantly writing for newspapers and journals, Chamberlain was supported financially by a wealthy German piano-manufacturer, August Ludowici (who liked Chamberlain so much that he purchased a house for him), and by the Swiss industrialist Ag√©nor Boissier, giving an annual income of about 30,000‚Äì40,000 marks (by contrast a German school-teacher had an annual income of 1,000 marks, while a professor made about 12,000 marks per year).Field (1981), pp. 337‚Äì38 In 1908, after Cosima Wagner suggested the match, Chamberlain married Wagner's daughter Eva von B√ºlow. He was extremely happy to be married to the daughter of his hero Wagner.Field (1981), pp. 347‚Äì50 = Chamberlain's character = Chamberlain, the self-proclaimed \\"Evangelist of Race\\", saw himself as a prophet, writing to the Kaiser: \\"Today, God relies only on the Germans. That is the knowledge, the sure truth, which has filled my soul for years; I have sacrificed my peace in serving it; for it I shall live and die.\\"Field (1981), p. 325 Eulenburg recalled that under his quiet demeanor Chamberlain had a \\"fiery spirit with those eyes and looks which speak volumes\\". The few who knew Chamberlain well described him as a quiet, reserved man full of urbane erudition and charm; a modest, genial character with elegant manners dressed in expensive suits who could talk brilliantly and with much wit about a great number of subjects for hours. But under his polished surface, Chamberlain had a \\"fanatical and obsessive\\" side. His copious notebooks and letters show a man with \\"a profoundly irrational mind\\", a markedly sadistic and deeply paranoid individual who believed himself to be the victim of a monstrous worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy him.Field (1981), pp. 325‚Äì26 Chamberlain's status as a semi-recluse came about because of his fear that the Jews were plotting his murder. = German world dominance by race = A strong imperialist, Chamberlain was naturally a fervent supporter of Weltpolitik, under which Germany sought to become the world's dominant power, which he justified on racist grounds. In 1904, when the German government committed the Herero and Namaqua Genocide against the Herero and Namaqua peoples in German South-West Africa (modern Namibia), Chamberlain congratulated Wilhelm in a letter for his genocidal policies, praising the Kaiser for his \\"war of extermination\\", which was \\"a fine example\\" of how Aryans should deal with \\"niggers\\".Fraser (January 1990), p. 414 In a 1906 letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain announced that due to miscegenation caused by the Jews, Britain, France, Austria and Russia were all declining powers, and only the \\"pure\\" German Reich was capable of protecting the \\"life-giving center of Western Europe\\" from the \\"Tartarized Russians, the dreaming weakly mongrels of Oceania and South America, and the millions of blacks, impoverished in intellect and bestially inclined, who even now are arming for the war of the races in which there will be no quarter given\\". Thus, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm, German Weltpolitik was a \\"sacred mission\\" to protect the superior races and cultures from the inferior. Chamberlain concluded his letter that the ideas of white supremacy had \\"not only justified the vast aggressions of Russia and England in the nineteenth century, but it also sanctions beforehand all that Germany may choose to appropriate in the twentieth\\". = Antisemite Eulenburg's Homosexuality = In 1908, the Harden‚ÄìEulenburg affair badly damaged Wilhelm's reputation when Wilhelm's and Chamberlain's mutual friend Eulenburg was exposed in the press as a homosexual. Since Eulenburg had been the Emperor's best friend since 1886, the scandal led to much gossip all over the Reich about whether Wilhelm and Eulenburg had been more than just best friends. Eulenburg was quite open about being gay when he was in the company of his closest friends, and he and Wilhelm had been the very best of friends for 22 years, leading the British historian John C. G. R√∂hl to conclude it was very unlikely that Wilhelm was ignorant of Eulenburg's sexual orientation as he claimed after Eulenburg was outed.R√∂hl (2004), pp. 61‚Äì62 After Eulenburg was exposed, the Kaiser wrote him a very cold letter saying that he could not stand the company of homosexuals, as such their friendship was now over and he never wanted to see or hear from Eulenburg again. Chamberlain was never as close to Eulenburg as Wilhelm was, and seemed genuinely shocked to learn of the allegations that Eulenburg was gay.Field (1981), p. 260 The Eulenburg affair played a role in Germany very similar to the Dreyfus affair in France, except that the victim in this case was the prominent anti-Semite Eulenburg. During the scandal, practically the entire v√∂lkisch movement came out in support of Eulenburg whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual framed by false allegations of homosexuality by the Jews Max Bernstein and Magnus Hirschfeld.Domeier (2015), p. 169 The German journalist Theodor Wolff wrote in 1906 about Eulenburg's role as one of Germany's chief anti-Semites: > I bet you ten to one that it was that skald [Eulenburg], the friend and > admirer of Gobineau, who first pointed his other friend, the Kaiser towards > the racial prophet's most eager disciple, Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The > mystical notion of the \\"race that will bring order to the world\\" found its > way from Gobineau via Eulenburg and Chamberlain to the Kaiser, and this > notion in turn gave rise to the thought that \\"the world should be healed by > the German spirit.\\"Domeier (2015) p. 172 In a letter to Chamberlain, Wilhelm wrote that entire scandal had emerged because of \\"Jewish cheek, slander and lies\\".R√∂hl (2004), p. 206 In the same letter, an enraged Wilhelm told Chamberlain that Maximilian Harden, the German Jewish convert to Lutheranism and the journalist who had outed Eulenburg was a \\"loathsome, dirty Jewish fiend\\" and a \\"poisonous toad out of the slime of hell, a disgraceful stain on our Volk\\". However, despite his strongly held anti-Semitism and his frequently expressed wish to expel the entire German Jewish community, the Kaiser held back under the grounds that if he expelled all of the Jews from Germany, it would set the German economy back by a century, and as such, he had to grudgingly tolerate his Jewish subjects.R√∂hl (2004), pp. 206‚Äì07 = Toning down attacks on Catholicism = As a part of his role as the \\"Evangelist of Race\\", Chamberlain toned down his anti-Catholicism in the first decade of the 20th century, realizing belatedly that his attacks on the Catholic Church in The Foundations had alienated the German Catholic community from his message.Field (1981), pp. 307‚Äì09 = Themes: German unity and German science and philosophy = As a well-known public intellectual, Chamberlain wrote on numerous subjects in a vast array of newspapers and magazines. Besides attacking the Jews, one of the chief themes of Chamberlain's essays was the unity of German culture, language, race and art, and the need for the unity of German art with a racialized \\"Germanic Christianity\\".Field (1981), pp. 310‚Äì11 The other major theme of Chamberlain's work was science and philosophy. Chamberlain was always keenly interested in modern science and saw himself as a scientist, but he was deeply critical of the claim that modern science could explain everything, believing there was a spiritual side to humanity that science could not explain.Field (1981), pp. 280‚Äì81 As such, Chamberlain believed that modern Germany was being destroyed by people losing their spiritual aspects owing to the materialist belief that science could explain all.Field (1981), p. 281 In his 1905 biography of one of his heroes, the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown the limits of rationalism and reason for understanding the world.Field (1981), p. 283 Instead, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown that the instinctive approach based on intuition was a far more valid way of understanding the world. Inevitably, Chamberlain's \\"Kantian\\" way of understanding science was used to attack the Jews, with Chamberlain writing: ::\\"In order to understand Kant we must ... begin by once and for all getting rid of the heavy burden of inherited and indoctrinated Jewish conceptions.\\"Field (1981), p. 284 In the same way, Chamberlain's 1912 biography of another of his heroes, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, was used to pass on the same message. Chamberlain depicted Goethe as a \\"Kantian\\" man who had correctly embraced both the rational, scientific approaches to life and the instinctive, mystical approach to achieve a synthesis that embraced the best of both worlds.Field (1981), pp. 287‚Äì90 Again, Chamberlain used Goethe as a way of bashing the Jews, with Chamberlain claiming that Goethe had favored banning sexual relations between Aryans and Jews and was a man who would not have \\"suffered among us\\" the Jewish artists, journalists, and professors of modern Germany.Field (1981), p. 290 The German Jewish journal Im deutschen Reich wrote in a review of Goethe that Chamberlain had appropriated Goethe in \\"a polemic about race politics, racial hygiene and racial worth from the standpoint of a monomaniacal Judeophobia\\". = Embracing Treitschke = The policies of Weltpolitik, especially the Tirpitz Plan, brought about a period of Anglo-German tension in the first years of the 20th century. Chamberlain, who detested the land of his birth, had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain, who came to hate Britain, expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world's wealth was the same as his own. In another letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain wrote: \\"There are periods, when history is, as it were, woven on a loom ... in such a way that the warp and woof are established and are essentially unalterable; but then come times when the threads are introduced for a new fabric, when the time of material and the design must first be determined. ... We find ourselves in such a time today.\\"Field (1981), pp .359‚Äì60 = Necessary German power = Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world's greatest power, both for its own good and for the good of the rest of the world.Field (1981), p. 360 In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of \\"stupid\\" Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood; without the German blood in the House of Romanov \\"nothing would remain but a decaying mati√®re brute\\" in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain was very anti-American and called the United States a \\"Dollar dynasty\\", writing: > From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will > live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, not > a moment longer. That part of the world, it may be proven, creates > sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past. Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: \\"The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth.\\" To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing v√∂lkisch Pan-German League.Field (1981), pp. 360‚Äì61 Bust of Chamberlain (c. 1914), from an unfinished clay model for a bust by Joseph Hinterbeher Propagandist of the World War In August 1914, he started suffering from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At the end of the war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health.Field (1981), p.363 In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: \\"No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse. ... Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe.\\"Field (1981), p. 352 The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an \\"Aryan soldier-king\\" and as a \\"Siegfried\\" who had embraced the \\"struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry\\".R√∂hl (2004), p. 207 Chamberlain went on to call the war \\"a life-or-death struggle ... between two human ideals: the German and the un-German\\". Accordingly, the Reich must \\"for the next hundred years or more\\" strengthen all things German and carry out \\"the determined extermination of the un-German\\". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: \\"I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations‚Äî1870 and 1914‚Äîand that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes.\\"Field (1981), p. 381 In his 1914 essay, \\"Whose Fault Is the War?\\", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain.Field (1981), p. 365 Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war, and the French and Russians were just British puppets.Field (1981), pp. 365‚Äì66 Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited,Adorno, Theodor W. (1985) \\"On the Question: \\"What is German?\\", Levin, Thomas Y. (trans.) in New German Critique, No. 36. 1985. p.123 were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. R√∂hl wrote the war made the \\"brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular\\" of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain \\"more intense\\". During World War I, Chamberlain published several propaganda texts against his country of birth‚ÄîKriegsaufs√§tze (Wartime Essays). In the first four tracts, he maintained that Germany is a nation of peace; England's political system is a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining \\"living\\" language; and the world would be better off doing away with English and French-styled parliamentary governments in favour of German rule \\"thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence\\". The final two discuss England and Germany at length.Chamberlain, Houston Stewart (1915) The Ravings of a Renegade: Being the War Essays of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. Charles H. Clark (trans.). London: Jarrold and Sons Chamberlain's basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth‚Äîhumans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the opinions of the next was a completely flawed idea.Field (1981), pp. 368‚Äì69 Quoting the French scientist Gustave Le Bon, Chamberlain wrote the vast majority of people were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France.Field (1981), p. 369 In Germany, Chamberlain asserted, true freedom existed, as freedom came from the state alone which made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos.Field (1981), p. 368 Field summarized Chamberlain's thesis \\"... the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Consigning 'liberty' to an inner, 'nonpolitical' moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government.\\" Quoting‚Äîsometimes wildly out of context‚Äîvarious British, French and American authors, such as John Richard Green, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, John Robert Seeley, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, Paul Bourget, Francis Delaisi, James Bryce, John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson, and H. G. Wells, Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed \\"to further the interests of money making all over the globe\\".Field (1981), pp. 367‚Äì71 Chamberlain's attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow \\"Jewish plutocrats\\" to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American.Field (1981), pp. 368‚Äì71 Right from the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews.Field (1981), pp. 370‚Äì71 Chamberlain wrote that America \\"is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature\\".Field (1981), p. 371 Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the Ausw√§rtiges Amt worked hard to prevent Chamberlain's essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America. Chamberlain's wartime writings also gained much attention ‚Äì albeit of a highly negative sort ‚Äì in his native Britain, with The Times Literary Supplement declaring: \\"The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense.\\"Field (1981), p. 366. In 1915, an unauthorised translation of Chamberlain's wartime essays was published in London under the unflattering title of The Ravings of a Renegade. In his 1915 pamphlet Deutschland und England (Germany and England), Chamberlain vigorously took the side of his adopted land against the land of his birth. Chamberlain explained in Germany and England how the British were once noble Aryans like the Germans who lived in a perfect rigidly hierarchical, romantically rural \\"unmixed\\" society, but then starting in the 16th century capitalism had corrupted the English. Capitalism had turned the English into an urban nation dominated by a vulgar money-grubbing, philistine middle class incapable of any sort of culture. The beautiful English countryside, which Chamberlain claimed was once the home of an idyllic agrarian society, had become an ugly urban landscape full of polluting factories owned by greedy Jewish capitalists. Even worse in Chamberlain's opinion, capitalism had led the English into a process of racial degeneration, democracy and rule by the Jews. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how the sons of the English aristocracy \\"disappear from society to make money\\", leading to a warped \\"moral compass\\" on their part in contrast to Germany where the Junkers either tended to their estates or had careers in the Army. Chamberlain's discussion of Britain ended with the lament that his idealised \\"Merry Old England\\" no longer existed, with Chamberlain writing: > We were merry, we are merry no longer. The complete decline of country life > and the equally complete victory of God Mammon, the deity of Industry and > Trade, have caused the true, harmless, refreshing merriness to betake itself > out of England. Germany by contrast in Chamberlain's view, had preserved its racial purity and by having an authoritarian government and a welfare state, had avoided both laissez-faire capitalism and Jewish rule.Buruma (200), pp. 220‚Äì221 It was for this reason that Chamberlain alleged that Britain had started World War I in 1914 to destroy Germany. For all these reasons Chamberlain stated he had come to hate Britain and love Germany, as Germany had preserved everything that Chamberlain considered to be noble in humanity while Britain had long since lost its nobility of spirit. Chamberlain received the Iron Cross from the Kaiser, with whom he was in regular correspondence, in 1916.Shirer (1959), p. 108 By this time, Chamberlain's obsessive anti-Semitism had reached the point that Chamberlain was suffering from nightmares in which he was kidnapped and sentenced to death by the Jews. In 1915, Chamberlain wrote proudly in a letter to a friend that: \\"My lawyer friend in Munich tells me there is no living being whom the Jews hate more than I.\\" In another essay, Chamberlain wrote the \\"pure Germanic force\\" had to be saved from the \\"disgusting worm\\" (the phrase \\"disgusting worm\\" was often used by Wagner to describe the Jews). Chamberlain wrote the purpose of this \\"struggle\\" was \\"salvation from the claws of the un- German and anti-German\\", going on to quote from Wagner's 1850 anti-Semitic essay Das Judenthum in der Musik that \\"Against this devil's brood stands Germany as God's champion: Siegfried against the worm!\\" During the war years, Chamberlain was one of the \\"annexationists\\" who wanted the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the Reich the \\"world power status\\" he believed it deserved.Field (1981), pp. 381‚Äì82 As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the Pan-German League, the Conservatives and the v√∂lkische groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought. Chamberlain was a founding member of the Independent Commission for a German Peace, and in July 1915 he signed the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1,347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible. Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain's essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character, as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who were supposedly seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany's power that would allow the Reich to win the war.Field (1981), p. 382 In a letter to his friend Prince Maximilian of Baden, Chamberlain wrote: > I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these > things‚Äîeven when they go on secretly‚Äîthat the Jews are completely > intoxicated by their success in Germany‚Äîfirst from the millions they have > gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all > official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their > machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already they are beginning to lose > their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a > flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!. In October‚ÄìNovember 1916, the so-called Judenz√§hlung (\\"Jew count\\") was held by the German Army to examine the popular anti-Semitic claim that German Jews were \\"shirking\\" their duty to the Fatherland by avoiding war service.Field (1981), pp. 386‚Äì87 The \\"Jew count\\" revealed that in fact German Jews were disproportionately over-represented in the front-line units, as most German Jews were anxious to prove their German patriotism and love of the Fatherland by volunteering for front-line duty. Many young German Jewish men wished to rebut the anti-Semitic canard that they were not real Germans by fighting for the Fatherland, and thus showing that they loved Germany as much as their Gentile neighbors, hence the disproportionate number of German Jews on the front-line compared to their share of the German population.Wette (2006), pp. 34-37 As the results of the \\"Jew count\\" did not please the two men in charge of High Command, namely Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff, the latter a \\"fanatical anti-Semite\\" who had been expecting the \\"Jew Count\\" to reveal that German Jews were disproportionally underrepresented on the front-line, the High Command issued a facetious statement saying that for the safety of the German Jewish community the \\"Jew count\\" could not be made public, as it would endanger the lives of German Jews.Wette, (2006), p. 37 The implication that if people could see just how far German Jews were allegedly \\"shirking\\" their duty to the Fatherland, then pogroms would break out in Germany led to a major upsurge in anti-Semitism, which Chamberlain was quick to exploit.Field (1981), p. 387 In support of a harder line both in the war and on the home front, Chamberlain involved himself in the intrigues to oust Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg as Chancellor and replace him with the \\"hard man\\", Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.Field (1981), p. 383 In Chamberlain's opinion, if only Germany were to wage the war more ruthlessly and brutally, then the war would be won.Field (1981), pp. 383‚Äì84 Chamberlain loathed Bethmann-Hollweg whom he saw as an inept leader who simply did not have the will to win. Chamberlain had an unbounded confidence in the ability of the Army and Navy to win the war, but on the home front, Chamberlain believed the Reich was \\"leaderless\\" as he viewed Bethmann-Hollweg as a Jewish \\"puppet\\" unwilling and unable to stop defeatism, corruption or the demand for more democracy. Besides supporting Tirpitz as Chancellor, Chamberlain was all for adopting unrestricted submarine warfare‚Äîeven at the risk of provoking the United States into the war‚Äîas the best way of starving Britain into surrender.Field (1981), p. 384 Chamberlain was also a very public supporter of Zeppelin raids to destroy British cities. After a discussion with his friend and admirer, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Chamberlain published a newspaper essay in July 1915 complaining that the government had imposed far too many restrictions on Zeppelin raids in order to save innocent British lives, and he argued that his country should bomb British cities with no concern for lives of civilians as ordinary British people deserved to die. The campaign by the annexationists against Bethmann-Hollweg was in large part motivated by the fact that the annexationists believed that Bethmann-Hollweg was not one of them. Had Chamberlain or any of the other annexationists been aware of the secret September Programme of 1914, where Bethmann-Hollweg planned to announce his intentions for annexing much of Europe and Africa after the soon to be expected fall of Paris, they would have had a different opinion of Bethmann- Hollweg.Fraser (January 1990), pp. 410-24 Under the constitution of 1871, the Reichstag had limited powers, but one of those was the right to vote on the budget. In the 1912 Reichstag elections, the anti-militarist Social Democrats had won the largest number of seats in the Reichstag. Thus Bethmann-Hollweg had to work with the SPD to get the budgets passed to finance the war. In August 1914, the government had been able to persuade the majority of the SPD to support the war on the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany. The SPD broke into two; the Majority Social Democrats supported the war while the minority Independent Social Democrats stayed true to their pacifist beliefs and opposed the war. The Majority Social Democrats agreed to support the war to the extent it was portrayed as a defensive struggle against Russia, but the Majority SPD wanted nothing to do with the annexationists. Hence, Bethmann-Hollweg's refusal to support the annexationists in public was due to pragmatic political considerations, namely, his need for majority Social Democratic co-operation in the Reichstag as opposed to being against the annexationists as Chamberlain mistakenly believed.Fraser (January 1990), p. 410 If the parties supporting annexationists, such as the Conservatives, National Liberals and Free Conservatives, had done better in the 1912 elections, Bethmann-Hollweg would almost certainly have taken a different line in public regarding the demands of the annexationists. Much of Chamberlain's strident, aggressive and embittered rhetoric reflected the fact that the annexationists were a minority in Germany, albeit a significant, vocal, well organised minority with many influential members inside and outside the government, but a minority nonetheless.Fraser (January 1990), p. 419 The majority of the German people did not support the annexationists. Chamberlain regarded the refusal of the democratic parties like the left-wing SPD, the right-of-the-centre Zentrum and the liberal Progressives to join the annexationist movement as essentially high treason. In August 1916, there occurred what amounted to a military coup d'√©tat when Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff informed Wilhelm and Bethmann-Hollweg that henceforward the Army would no longer obey either the Kaiser or the government, and that from now the Emperor and the Chancellor would now obey the Army. In July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff had Bethmann-Hollweg dismissed and replaced with Georg Michaelis as Chancellor. Chamberlain's preferred candidate as Chancellor, Admiral Tirpitz, was passed over. Tirpitz was an intelligent, media-savvy, charismatic political intriguer with a desperate hunger for political power, but the duumvirate of Hindenburg and Ludendorff regarded Tirpitz as Chancellor as too much of a threat to their own power. In response to the firing of Bethmann-Hollweg, the democratic parties decided to protest by passing a peace resolution. The Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917‚Äîin which the SPD, Zentrum and the Progressives all joined forces to vote for a resolution asking the government to start peace talks at once on the basis of a return to the status quo of 1914‚Äî\\"inflamed the paranoia and desperation of the right. The annexationists prepared for a war to the knife against the Chancellor and domestic \\"traitors\\".\\"Field (1981), p. 388 Chamberlain was disappointed that Tirpitz had not been appointed Chancellor; however, he was overjoyed with Bethmann-Hollweg's sacking and welcomed the military dictatorship of Hindenburg and Ludendorff as giving Germany the sort of government it needed.Field (1981), p. 389 Chamberlain was always inclined to hero worship, and for him, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were the greatest of a long line of German heroes. Chamberlain wrote in 1917 that: \\"Had Hindenburg and Ludendorff stood on the first day in their rightful place, the peace would in all probability have been dictated in Paris before the end of 1914.\\" Besides being an annexationist who wanted to see the war end with Germany as the world's greatest power, Chamberlain also advocated a set of wide-ranging changes to German society intended to achieve a \\"rebirth\\" of Germany.Field (1981), p. 377 Chamberlain wanted to see the Spirit of 1914 made permanent, to convert the wartime Burgfrieden (\\"peace within a castle under siege\\") into a peacetime Volksgemeinschaft (people's community). He also wanted a new economic and social system that would be a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism to bring about the Volksgemeinschaft organized along corporatist lines. To achieve this, Chamberlain called for the end to any remaining democratic features the constitution of 1871 still possessed and the creation of a pure dictatorship; for the end of the capitalist system with the state to nationalize huge sections of the economy while at the same time respecting the right to private property; and for the militarization of society on a new scale.Field (1981), pp. 371‚Äì77 Chamberlain was somewhat vague about how this corporatist society would work in practice, but what he wanted was rule by an oligarchy of aristocrats, intellectuals, bureaucrats and military officers who would run a \\"planned economy\\" via \\"scientific management\\".Field (1981), pp. 373‚Äì74 The entire German people (except for the Jews, whom Chamberlain believed did not belong in Germany) were to be united by a common loyalty to the Emperor. A fanatical monarchist, Chamberlain saw the monarchy as the bedrock of German life, writing in his 1915 book Politische Ideale: \\"Whoever speaks of a republic in Germany belongs on the gallows; the monarchical idea is here a holy law of life.\\"Field (1981), p. 372. At the same time, Chamberlain envisioned a Germany that would somehow remain the leading industrial power at the forefront of modern technology while at the same time become a romantic, agrarian society where ordinary people would work the land and retain their traditional deference to the aristocracy.Field (1981), pp. 371‚Äì73 Chamberlain was also vague about how this could be achieved, writing only that a \\"planned economy\\", \\"scientific management\\" and an economically interventionist state committed to social reforms would make it all possible. After Germany's diplomatic defeat in the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, Wilhelm II became the Schattenkaiser (the \\"Shadow Emperor\\"), an increasingly reclusive figure who was seen less and less in public. The war further reinforced Wilhelm's tendency to avoid the public spotlight as much as possible. In private, Chamberlain grew disillusioned with his friend, complaining that instead of being the \\"Aryan soldier king\\" leading the Reich to victory as he wanted and expected him to be, the Kaiser was a weak leader as the \\"Shadow Emperor\\" was hiding himself away in deep seclusion from the rest of Germany at his hunting lodges. Wilhelm's hiding himself away from his own people during the war did immense damage to the prestige of the monarchy, and if the Kaiser's seclusion did not make the November Revolution of 1918 inevitable, it at least made it possible. As a monarchist, Chamberlain was worried about how Wilhelm was hurting his own reputation, and often vainly urged the Kaiser to appear in public more often. Chamberlain wrote in 1916 that Wilhelm had an \\"absolute incapability for judging character\\" and was now being \\"forced to obey a Frankfurt pimp\\", the last being a disparaging reference to Bethmann-Hollweg. Chamberlain was always very careful to avoid attacking Wilhelm in public, but his violent press attacks against Bethmann- Hollweg caused something of a rift with the Kaiser who felt Chamberlain's very public criticism of the Chancellor was also an indirect attack on him. Nonetheless, despite the strains the war imposed on their friendship, Chamberlain and Wilhelm continued to write throughout the war, but pointedly did not meet in person anymore, though Chamberlain's increasing paralysis also played a part. Wilhelm wrote to Chamberlain on 15 January 1917, stating: > The war is a struggle between two Weltanschauungen, the Teutonic-German for > morality, right, loyalty and faith, genuine humanity, truth and real > freedom, against ... the worship of Mammon, the power of money, pleasure, > land-hunger, lies, betrayal, deceit and‚Äîlast but not least‚Äîtreacherous > assassination! These two Weltanschauungen cannot be reconciled or tolerate > one another, one must be victorious, the other must go under!R√∂hl (2004), p. > 208 In response, Chamberlain wrote back to Wilhelm on 20 January 1917, declaring: > England has fallen totally into the hands of the Jews and the Americans. A > person does not understand this war unless he realizes that it is in the > deepest sense the war of Judentum and its near relative Americanism for the > control of the world‚Äîa war against Christianity, against Bildung, moral > strength, uncommercial art, against every idealist perspective on life, and > for the benefit of a world that would include only industry, finance, and > trade‚Äîin short, unrestricted plutocracy. All the other additional > factors‚ÄîRussian greed, French vanity, Italian bombast, the envious and > cowardly spirit of the neutrals‚Äîare whipped up, made crazy; the Jew and the > Yankee are the driving forces that operate consciously and in a certain > sense have hitherto been victorious or at all events successful ... It is > the war of modern mechanized \\"civilization\\" against the ancient, holy and > continually reborn culture of chosen races. Machines will crush both spirit > and soul in their clutches. Chamberlain continued to believe right up until the end of the war that Germany would win only if the people willed victory enough, and this sort of ideological war between \\"German idealism\\" vs. \\"Jewish materialism\\" could only end with one side utterly crushing the other. In the last two years of the war, Chamberlain became obsessed with defeating the \\"inner enemy\\" that he believed was holding Germany back. In this regard, Chamberlain frequently asserted that Germany was not one nation, but two; on one side, the \\"patriots\\" like Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, General Erich Ludendorff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, Wolfgang Kapp, J. F. Lehmann and Count von Reventlow; and on the other, the \\"traitors\\" which included people like Philipp Scheidemann, Eduard David and Matthias Erzberger. No compromise between these two Germanies was possible or desirable, Chamberlain argued, and one would have to be destroyed. Chamberlain's wartime writings against the \\"inner enemy\\" anticipated the \\"stab-in-the-back legend\\" which emerged after 1918. Chamberlain was a founding member of both the extreme-right, anti-Semitic Deutschlands Erneuerung newspaper, and of the Fatherland Party in 1917. The character of the Fatherland Party was well illustrated by an infamous incident in January 1918 when at a Fatherland Party rally in Berlin, a group of disabled war veterans were invited to debate the Fatherland Party's speakers.Evans (2005), p. 68 The wounded veterans, including men who were paralyzed, blinded, missing limbs, etc. all declared that they were now against the war and had become pacifists. The crippled veterans deplored the Fatherland Party's militarism and demand for war to go until victory, regardless of how many more would have to die or end up living with destroyed bodies. The ultra-nationalists of the Fatherland Party were so enraged by what the crippled veterans had to say that the audience stormed the stage, and savagely beat the disabled veterans senseless. Chamberlain, who lived in Bayreuth. was not present during the Berlin rally, but expressed his approval of what had happened when he heard of it. During the war, most Germans saw Britain as the main enemy, and so Chamberlain's status as the Englishman who supported the Reich made him an even more famous celebrity in Germany than he had been before 1914. Chamberlain's wartime essays were widely read. The first set of essays sold 160,000 copies within six months of publication while the second set sold 75,000 copies within six weeks of publication.Field (1981), p. 390 Between 1914 and 1918 about 1 million copies of Chamberlain's essays were sold, making Chamberlain one of Germany's best read writers during the war. In December 1915, it was estimated that between the direct sales of Chamberlain's essays and reprints in newspapers, at least 3 million people had read Chamberlain's war-time writings. Such was the power of Chamberlain as a public figure that in August 1916 the German Jewish industrialist Walther Rathenau‚Äîwhom Chamberlain had often accused of profiteering‚Äîmailed Chamberlain a copy of his bank balance sheets, which showed that Rathenau was in fact getting poorer as a result of the war, and politely asked Chamberlain to stop accusing him of war profiteering.Field (1981), pp. 391‚Äì92 Rathenau's appeal made no impression, and Chamberlain continued to accuse Rathenau of war profiteering right until he was assassinated in 1922.Field (1981), p. 392 In 1917 Chamberlain wrote about the liberal Frankfurter Zeitung newspaper: \\"No knowledgeable person, can doubt that the enemy is at work among us ... whenever England has something up her sleeve against the interests of Germany, she uses the Frankfurter Zeitung.\\" Bernhard Guttmann, the editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung sued Chamberlain for libel about that article. In August 1918, the sensational libel trial which attracted much media attention opened. The Frankfurter Zeitung's lawyers were Conrad Haussmann and Hertz while Chamberlain was defended by Heinrich Class and Adolf Jacobsen.Field (1981), pp. 392‚Äì93 On 16 August 1918, the trial ended with the judge ruling that Chamberlain was indeed guilty of libel and fined him 1,500 marks.Field (1981), p. 393 The guilty verdict set off a storm in right-wing circles, who quickly held several successful fund-raisers that raised the necessary 1,500 marks to pay Chamberlain's fine.Field (1981), p. 394 Portrait, unknown date Hitler's mentor In November 1918, Chamberlain was completely shattered and horrified by Germany's defeat in the war, a defeat he believed to be impossible, as well as by the November Revolution, which had toppled his beloved monarchy.Field (1981), pp. 396‚Äì97 Adding to his bitterness, Chamberlain was now so paralyzed that he could no longer leave his bed, something that he believed to be the result of poisoning by the British secret service.Field (1981), p. 397 Chamberlain saw both the defeat and the revolution of 1918 as the work of the Jews, writing in 1919 that Germany was now under the \\"supremacy of the Jews\\".Field (1981), p. 401 In his last years, Chamberlain's anti-Semitic writings grew ever more violent and bloodthirsty as Chamberlain became even more intensely anti-Semitic than he had been before 1918. In March 1920, Chamberlain supported the Kapp Putsch against the Weimar Republic, which he called the Judenrepublik (\\"Jewish Republic\\"), and was even more embittered by its failure.Field (1981), p. 417 The Kapp putsch was defeated by a general strike called by the Social Democrats which shut down the entire German economy. A young v√∂lkisch activist Josef Stolzing-Cerny and a Chamberlain prot√©g√© who had participated in the Kapp putsch wrote to Chamberlain after its failure: \\"Unfortunately Kapp was not all 'the man with the lion heart', much rather the man with the beer heart, for he continually used all his energies befuddling his brain with alcohol. ... In the same situation a Bismarck or a Napoleon would have hunted the whole Jewish-socialist republic to the devil.\\" Stolzing-Cerny went on to criticize Kapp for not unleashing the Freikorps Marinebrigade Ehrhardt which had taken Berlin against the Jews of Berlin, instead ordering the Freikorps to keep order. After the failure of the putsch, Chamberlain no longer considered Wolfgang Kapp to be one of his heroes, and instead damned him as a weak-willed coward all too typical of German conservatives who talked tough, but never followed up their words with action. More importantly, the failure of the Kapp putsch to a certain extent discredited traditional German conservatism in Chamberlain's eyes, and led him on the search for a more radical alternative, a type of \\"German socialism\\" that would offer a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism.Field (1981), p. 419 In January 1921, Stolzing-Cerny, who joined the NSDAP in December 1920, wrote to Chamberlain about the new man on the political scene, \\"one Adolf Hitler, an Austrian worker, a man of extraordinary oratorical talents and an astonishingly rich political knowledge who knows marvelously how to thrill the masses\\".Field (1981), p. 421 Initially, Chamberlain was hesitant about Hitler, believing that he might be another Kapp, but after the \\"battle of Coburg\\", in which Hitler had personally fought with his followers in a street battle against the Communists, Chamberlain started to see Hitler as someone who practiced what he preached.Field (1981), p. 422 From that time onwards, Chamberlain started to closely follow and admire Hitler, whom he saw as \\"Germany's savior\\". Hitler in his turn had read The Foundations, Chamberlain's biography of Wagner, and many of his wartime essays, and was much influenced by all that Chamberlain had written.Field (1981), p. 452 British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, a biographer of Hitler, writes that > ... Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well known anti-Semitic tracts > such as those by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Adolf Wahrmund and especially, > the arch-popularizer Theodor Fritsch (one of whose emphasis was the alleged > sexual abuse of women by the Jews)...Kershaw, Ian (1998) Hitler: 1889-1936: > Hubris. New York: Norton. p. 151 The fact that Hitler was an ardent Wagnerite who adored Wagner's music gave Chamberlain and Hitler a mutual ground for friendship beyond their shared hatred of the Jews. Likewise, Joseph Goebbels had been converted to the v√∂lkisch ideology after reading Chamberlain's books and essays, and came to the conclusion on the basis of Chamberlain's writings that the West could only be saved by removing the Jews from German society.Evans (2005), p. 204 During this period, Chamberlain, who was practically a member of the Wagner family, started to push for the Bayreuth Festival to become openly identified with v√∂lkisch politics, and to turn the previously apolitical festival into a v√∂lkisch rally.Field (1981), pp. 428‚Äì29 Despite his paralysis, Chamberlain whose mind was still sharp, remained active as a writer, maintaining a correspondence with a whole gamut of figures from Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to the radical anti-Semitic journalist Theodor Fritsch, the leader of the v√∂lkisch Hammerbund (\\"Hammer League\\").Field (1981), p. 429 From his exile in the Netherlands, the former Kaiser wrote to Chamberlain in 1922 to tell him that thanks to his essays, he had become a Marcionist and now rejected the Old Testament.R√∂hl (2004), p. 209 Wilhelm claimed that on the basis of Chamberlain's work, he now knew that what had become the Old Testament was in fact a Zoroastrian text from ancient Persia (modern Iran) and was therefore \\"Aryan\\". The former Kaiser claimed that the Jews had stolen and rewritten this sacred text from the Aryan Persians, ending his letter: \\"Let us free ourselves from the Judentum with its Jawe!\\" In 1923, Wilhelm wrote to tell Chamberlain of his belief that not only were the Jews \\"not our religious forebears\\", but that Jesus was \\"not a Jew\\", was instead an Aryan \\"of exceptional beauty, tall and slim with a noble face inspiring respect and love; his hair blond shading into chestnut brown, his arms and hands noble and exquisitely formed\\". In 1923 Chamberlain met with Adolf Hitler in Bayreuth, and in September he sat in his wheelchair next to Hitler during the v√∂lkisch \\"German Day\\" paramilitary parade. In September 1923 he wrote a grateful and highly admiring open letter to the NSDAP leader. Chamberlain, paralysed and despondent after Germany's losses in World War I, wrote to Hitler after his first visit in September 1923: Chamberlain's letter‚Äîwhich made him into the first celebrity to endorse the NSDAP‚Äîcaused a media sensation in Germany and led Hitler to rejoice \\"like a child\\" at the news.Field (1981), p. 438 When Hitler staged the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923, Chamberlain wrote an essay for the V√∂lkischer Beobachter entitled \\"God Wills It!\\" calling on all Germans who love Germany to join the putsch.Field (1981), p. 439 After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Chamberlain wrote: \\"We are deeply affected by this tragic fate, Jew and Jesuit can now triumph again!\\". Chamberlain joined the Nazi Party and contributed to its publications. Its primary journal, the V√∂lkischer Beobachter, dedicated five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing The Foundations as the \\"gospel of the National Socialist movement\\".Shirer (1959), p. 109 In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler as one of the \\"rare beautiful beings... a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze\\" whose words \\"always come directly from the heart\\".Field (1981), p. 440 Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a \\"Vernichtungskrieg\\" (\\"war of destruction\\") against all of Germany's enemies.Field (1981), p. 441 Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler‚Äîwhom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes‚Äîthat: > Because he [Hitler] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his > thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and > proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that > crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler‚Äîhis courage! ... In > this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these > two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler > utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding > or vague, provisional statements ... but the result of this is that he is > decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head > is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian > called him \\"the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of > statecraft.\\" I believe ... we are all inclined to view those things as > impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for > example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, > even murderous influence of Jewry on the German Volk and not to take action; > if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter > dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; > nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; > nobody except Hitler. ... This man has worked like a divine blessing, > cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their > spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening > their courage and resoluteness. Yet we still need him badly: May God who > sent him to us preserve him for many years as a \\"blessing for the German > Fatherland!\\"Field (1981), pp. 441‚Äì42 After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Hitler was convicted of high treason and imprisoned. When the 1924 Bayreuth Festival opened, Chamberlain's efforts to identify the festival with v√∂lkisch politics finally bore fruit.Field (1981), p. 443 The Festspielh√ºgel opera house and the way leading up to it were decorated with v√∂lkisch symbols like the swastika, parades by the nationalist Verb√§nde were held outside the Festspielh√ºgel, prominent v√∂lkisch leaders like General Erich Ludendorff appeared on the stage to give a speech attacking the Weimar Republic before one of the operas was performed, and a petition was offered to the audiences demanding that Hitler be pardoned. The 1924 festival led to 10,000 people in one night signing the petition asking for Hitler's release. From his prison cell at Landsberg prison, Hitler wrote to Siegfried Wagner expressing his sorrow about being unable to attend his beloved Bayreuth Festival and to express his thanks to the entire Wagner family and Chamberlain for turning the Bayreuth festival into a v√∂lkisch rally, adding that when he got out of prison, he would come to Bayreuth as \\"the first witness and herald\\" of Germany's rebirth.Field (1981), pp. 443‚Äì44 Hitler stated this would be the best medicine for Chamberlain's health as \\"the road to Berlin\\" started in Bayreuth.Field (1981), p. 444 In May 1926, one year before Chamberlain's death, Hitler and Goebbels visited him in Bayreuth. Chamberlain assured Hitler of his belief that he was the \\"chosen one\\" destined to lead Germany back to greatness after the defeat of 1918, to make the Reich a world power, and finally smash the Jews.Field (1981), p. 445 Much of Hitler's genuine affection for Chamberlain was due to the fact that Chamberlain never lost his faith in Hitler's potential, even at time in the mid-1920s when the NSDAP was faring very poorly.Field (1981), pp. 441‚Äì45 Chamberlain continued living in Bayreuth until his death in 1927.Mosse (1968), pp. xi, xivDegener, Herrmann A. L. (ed.) (1928) Wer Ist's? (the German Who's Who), Berlin. vol. 9, p. 1773 records the death on 9 January 1927, of \\"Houston Stewart Chamberlain, writer, Bayreuth\\". Chamberlain died on 9 January 1927 and was buried at the Bayreuth cemetery in the presence of Adolf Hitler. His gravestone bears a verse from the Gospel of Luke, which he considered to spell out the essential difference between his ideal type of Christianity, and Judaism and Catholicism as he saw them: \\"The Kingdom of God is within you.\\" () Impact of The Foundations During his lifetime Chamberlain's works were read widely throughout Europe, and especially in Germany. His reception was particularly favourable among Germany's conservative elite. Kaiser Wilhelm II patronised Chamberlain, maintaining a correspondence, inviting him to stay at his court, distributing copies of The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century among the German Army, and seeing that The Foundations was carried in German libraries and included in the school curricula. In 1932 in an essay entitled \\"Anti-Semitics\\" denouncing antisemitism, the \\"homeless left\\" German journalist Carl von Ossietzky wrote: \\"Intellectual anti-Semitism was the special prerogative of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who, in The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, concretized the fantasies of Count Arthur de Gobineau, which had penetrated to Bayreuth. He translated them from the language of harmless snobbery into [the language] of a modernized, seductive mysticism.\\"Ossietzky (1994), p. 280 Ossietzky ended his essay with the warning: \\"Today there is a strong smell of blood in the air. Literary anti- Semitism forges the moral weapon for murder. Sturdy and honest lads will take care of the rest.\\" The Foundations would prove to be a seminal work in German nationalism. Due to its success, aided by Chamberlain's association with the Wagner circle, its ideas of Aryan supremacy and a struggle against Jewish influence spread widely across the German state at the beginning of the century. If it did not form the framework of later Nazi ideology, at the very least it provided its adherents with a seeming intellectual justification.Mosse (1968), xvi. Many of Chamberlain's ideas such as his emphasis on a racial struggle between Aryans vs. Jews for world domination; his championing of \\"world power status\\" for Germany; his call for a \\"planned economy\\" (something realized in 1936 when Hitler brought in the First Four Year Plan which saw the German state take over the economy); his vision of Germany becoming the Volksgemeinschaft (people's community\\"); his demand for a \\"third way\\" between capitalism and socialism; his total opposition to democracy; and his nostalgia for an agrarian lifestyle were central to Nazism.Field (1981), p. 449 The only Nazi idea that Chamberlain missed was lebensraum (living space), the perceived need for Germany to colonize Eastern Europe while displacing the existing population to make room for Aryan colonists. However, there were differences in that Chamberlain was always a monarchist and believed that when his friend Hitler came to power, he would restore the monarchy and put his other friend Wilhelm II back on the throne. Had Chamberlain lived to see the Third Reich, he likely would have been disappointed that Hitler did not carry out the restoration of the monarchy that he so desired. Moreover, Chamberlain was just one of the many v√∂lkische thinkers who influenced Hitler. Chamberlain himself lived to see his ideas begin to bear fruit. Adolf Hitler, while still growing as a political figure in Germany, visited him several times (in 1923 and in 1926, together with Joseph Goebbels) at the Wagner family's property in Bayreuth. Later, in January 1927, Hitler, along with several highly ranked members of the Nazi Party, attended Chamberlain's funeral. Chamberlain's ideas particularly influenced Alfred Rosenberg, who became the Nazi Party's in-house philosopher. In 1909, some months before his 17th birthday, Rosenberg went with an aunt to visit his guardian where several other relatives were gathered. Bored, he went to a book shelf, picked up a copy of Chamberlain's The Foundations and wrote of the moment: \\"I felt electrified; I wrote down the title and went straight to the bookshop.\\" In 1930 Rosenberg published The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a homage to and continuation of Chamberlain's work. Rosenberg had accompanied Hitler when he called upon Wagner's widow, Cosima, in October 1923 when he met her son-in-law. Hitler told the ailing Chamberlain he was working on his own book which, he intended, should do for the Third Reich what Chamberlain's book had done for the Second.Cecil, Robert (1972) The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology, London. p. 12-13. Beyond the Kaiser and the NSDAP, assessments were mixed. The French Germanic scholar Edmond Vermeil considered Chamberlain's ideas \\"essentially shoddy,\\" but the anti-Nazi German author Konrad Heiden, despite objections to Chamberlain's racial ideas, described him as \\"one of the most astonishing talents in the history of the German mind, a mine of knowledge and profound ideas\\".Shirer (1959), pp. 105-06 In a 1939 work Martin Heidegger (himself a former Nazi) dismissed Chamberlain's work as presenting a subjective, individualistic \\"Weltanschauung\\" (fabricated worldview).Heidegger, Martin Besinnung, Gesamtausgabe, Band 66, Vittorio Klostermann, Frankfurt am Main, 1997, p. 402, section 131, \\"Metaphysik und Weltanschauung. \\"Die 'Weltanschauung' ist eine neuzeitliche Verunstaltung der Metaphysik, ihr Ma√üstab ist die √ñffentlichkeit, in der Jedermann Jedes zug√§nglich findet und auf solche Zug√§nglichlichkeit einen Anspruch erhebt; dem widerstreitet nicht, da√ü 'Weltanschauungen' dann sehr 'pers√∂nlich' und auf den 'Einzelnen' zugeschnitten sind; diese Einzelnen f√ºhlen sich als die abseitigen Jederm√§nner, als Menschen, die auf sich gestellt f√ºr sich ein Welt-Bild, die Welt als Bild vor-stellen und eine Art des Sichzurechtfindens (Charakter) sich zustellen (z.B.

The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids. Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery, which then splits up to form the interlobar arteries. The interlobar arteries each in turn branch into arcuate arteries, which in turn branch to form interlobular arteries, and these finally reach the glomeruli. At the glomerulus the blood reaches a highly disfavourable pressure gradient and a large exchange surface area, which forces the serum portion of the blood out of the vessel and into the renal tubules. Flow continues through the renal tubules, including the proximal tubule, the Loop of Henle, through the distal tubule and finally leaves the kidney by means of the collecting duct, leading to the renal pelvis, the dilated portion of the ureter. The renal medulla (Latin renes medulla = kidney middle) contains the structures of the nephrons responsible for maintaining the salt and water balance of the blood. These structures include the vasa rectae (both spuria and vera), the venulae rectae, the medullary capillary plexus, the loop of Henle, and the collecting tubule.Netter's, plate 337 The renal medulla is hypertonic to the filtrate in the nephron and aids in the reabsorption of water. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus by solute size. Ions such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and calcium are easily filtered, as is glucose. Proteins are not passed through the glomerular filter because of their large size, and do not appear in the filtrate or urine unless a disease process has affected the glomerular capsule or the proximal and distal convoluted tubules of the nephron. Though the renal medulla only receives a small percentage of the renal blood flow, the oxygen extraction is very high, causing a low oxygen tension and more importantly, a critical sensitivity to hypotension, hypoxia, and blood flow.Miller's Anesthesia, 8th edition. 553-554. The renal medulla extracts oxygen at a ratio of ~80% making it exquisitely sensitive to small changes in renal blood flow. The mechanisms of many perioperative renal insults are based on the disruption of adequate blood flow (and therefore oxygen delivery) to the renal medulla. Interstitium The medullary interstitium is the tissue surrounding the loop of Henle in the medulla. It functions in renal water reabsorption by building up a high hypertonicity, which draws water out of the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle and the collecting duct system.hypertonicity, in turn, is created by an efflux of urea from the inner medullary collecting duct. Page 837 Pyramids Renal pyramids (or malpighian pyramids or Malpighi's pyramids named after Marcello Malpighi, a seventeenth-century anatomist) are cone- shaped tissues of the kidney. In humans, the renal medulla is made up of 10 to 18 of these conical subdivisions. The broad base of each pyramid faces the renal cortex, and its apex, or papilla, points internally towards the pelvis. The pyramids appear striped because they are formed by straight parallel segments of nephrons' Loops of Henle and collecting ducts. The base of each pyramid originates at the corticomedullary border and the apex terminates in a papilla, which lies within a minor calyx, made of parallel bundles of urine collecting tubules. Papilla The renal papilla is the location where the renal pyramids in the medulla empty urine into the minor calyx in the kidney. Histologically it is marked by medullary collecting ducts converging to form a papillary duct to channel the fluid. Transitional epithelium begins to be seen. =Clinical significance= Some chemicals toxic to the kidney, called nephrotoxins, damage the renal papillae. Damage to the renal papillae may result in death to cells in this region of the kidney, called renal papillary necrosis. The most common toxic causes of renal papillary necrosis are NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and phenylbutazone, in combination with dehydration. Perturbed renal papillary development has also been shown to be associated with onset of functional obstruction and renal fibrosis. Renal papillary damage has also been associated with nephrolithiasis and can be quantified according to the papillary grading score, which accounts for contour, pitting, plugging and randall plaque.

The raised structure typically supports antenna and one or more sets of transmitter/receivers transceivers, digital signal processors, control electronics, a GPS receiver for timing (for CDMA2000/IS-95 or GSM systems), primary and backup electrical power sources, and sheltering. In Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks, the correct term is Base Transceiver Station (BTS), and colloquial synonyms are \\"mobile phone mast\\" or \\"base station\\". Multiple cellular providers often save money by mounting their antennas on a common shared mast; since separate systems use different frequencies, antennas can be located close together without interfering with each other. Some provider companies operate multiple cellular networks and similarly use colocated base stations for two or more cellular networks, (CDMA2000 or GSM, for example). Some cities require that cell sites be inconspicuous; they can be blended with the surrounding area or mounted on buildings or advertising towers. Preserved treescapes can often hide cell towers inside an artificial or preserved tree. These installations are generally referred to as concealed cell sites or stealth cell sites.  Overview  A cellular network is a network of handheld mobile phones (cell phones) in which each phone communicates with the telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna at a cellular base station (cell site). The coverage area in which service is provided is divided into a mosaic of small geographical areas called \\"cells\\", each served by a separate low power multichannel transceiver and antenna at a base station. All the cell phones within a cell communicate with the system through that cell's antenna, on separate frequency channels assigned by the base station from a common pool of frequencies used by the system. The purpose of cellular organization is to conserve radio bandwidth by frequency reuse; the low power radio signals used within each cell do not travel far beyond the cell, so the radio channels can be reused in geographically separated cells. When a mobile user moves from one cell to another, their phone is automatically \\"handed off\\" to the new cell's antenna, and assigned a new set of frequencies, and subsequently communicates with this antenna. This background handoff process is transparent to the user and can occur in the middle of a phone call without any service interruption. Each cell phone has an automated full duplex digital transceiver and communicates with the cell antenna over two digital radio channels in the UHF or microwave band, one for each direction of the bidirectional conversation, plus a control channel which handles registering the phone with the network, dialing, and the handoff process. Typically a cell tower is located at the edge of one or more cells and covers multiple cells using directional antennas. A common geometry is to locate the cell site at the intersection of three adjacent cells, with three antennas at 120¬∞ angles each covering one cell. The type of antenna used for cellular base stations (vertical white rectangles in pictures), called a sector antenna, usually consists of a vertical collinear array of dipoles. It has a flat fan-shaped radiation pattern, which is tilted slightly down to cover the cell area without radiating at higher angles into further off cells which reuse the same frequencies. The elevation angle of the antenna must be carefully adjusted, so the beam covers the entire cell without radiating too far. In modern sector antennas beam tilt can usually be adjusted electronically, to avoid the necessity of a lineman climbing the tower to mechanically tilt the antenna when adjustment is needed.

Operation  = Range = The working range of a cell site (the range which mobile devices connects reliably to the cell site) is not a fixed figure. It will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: * Height of antenna over surrounding terrain (Line-of-sight propagation). * The frequency of signal in use. * The transmitter's rated power. * The required uplink/downlink data rate of the subscriber's deviceJ. Andrews, A. Gohsh (2007). Fundamentals of WiMAX, p. 43 * The directional characteristics of the site antenna array. * Reflection and absorption of radio energy by buildings or vegetation. * It may also be limited by local geographical or regulatory factors and weather conditions. * In addition there are timing limitations in some technologies (e.g., even in free space, GSM would be limited to 35 km, with 70 km being possible with special equipment) Generally, in areas where there are enough cell sites to cover a wide area, the range of each one will be set to: * Ensure there is enough overlap for \\"handover\\" to/from other sites (moving the signal for a mobile device from one cell site to another, for those technologies that can handle it - e.g. making a GSM phone call while in a car or train). * Ensure that the overlap area is not too large, to minimize interference problems with other sites. In practice, cell sites are grouped in areas of high population density, with the most potential users. Cell phone traffic through a single site is limited by the base station's capacity; there is a finite number of calls or data traffic that a base station can handle at once. This capacity limitation is commonly the factor that determines the spacing of cell mast sites. In suburban areas, masts are commonly spaced 1‚Äì2 miles (2‚Äì3 km) apart and in dense urban areas, masts may be as close as ¬º-¬Ω mile (400‚Äì800 m) apart. The maximum range of a mast (where it is not limited by interference with other masts nearby) depends on the same considerations. In any case the limiting factor is the ability of a low-powered personal cell phone to transmit back to the mast. As a rough guide, based on a tall mast and flat terrain, it may be possible to get between 50 and 70 km (30‚Äì45 miles). When the terrain is hilly, the maximum distance can vary from as little as to due to encroachment of intermediate objects into the wide center fresnel zone of the signal.Frequently Asked PCS Questions undated, URL retrieved 14 August 2007. Depending on terrain and other circumstances, a GSM Tower can replace between 2 and of cabling for fixed wireless networks.NTIA Seeks Input on Broadband Stimulus Money undated, URL retrieved 3 March 2009. In addition, some technologies, such as GSM, have an additional absolute maximum range of , which is imposed by technical limitations. CDMA and IDEN have no such limit defined by timing.  Practical Example of Range  * 3G/4G/5G (FR1) Mobile base station tower: it is technically possible to cover up to 50 km-150 km. (Macrocell) * 5G (FR2) Mobile base station: the distances between the 5G base-station is about 250‚Äì300 m, due to the use of millimetre waves. = Channel reuse = The concept of \\"maximum\\" range is misleading in a cellular network. Cellular networks are designed to support many conversations with a limited number of radio channels (slices of radio frequency spectrum necessary to make one conversation) that are licensed to an operator of a cellular service. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to repeat and reuse the same channels at different locations. Just as a car radio changes from one local station to a completely different local station with the same frequency when traveling to another city, the same radio channel gets reused on a cell mast only a few miles away. To do this, the signal of a cell mast is intentionally kept at low power and in many cases tilted downward to limit its reach. This allows covering an area small enough not to have to support more conversations than the available channels can carry. Due to the sectorized arrangement of antennas on a tower, it is possible to vary the strength and angle for each sector depending on the coverage from other towers in the area. = Signal limiting factor = A cellphone may not work at times because it is too far from a mast, or because the phone is in a location where cell phone signals are attenuated by thick building walls, hills, or other structures. The signals do not need a clear line of sight but greater radio interference will degrade or eliminate reception. When many people try to use the cell mast at the same time, e.g. during a traffic jam or a sports event, then there will be a signal on the phone display but it is blocked from starting a new connection. The other limiting factor for cell phones is the ability to send a signal from its low powered battery to the cell site. Some cellphones perform better than others under low power or low battery, typically due to the ability to send a good signal from the phone to the mast. The base station controller (a central computer that specializes in making phone connections) and the intelligence of the cellphone keeps track of and allows the phone to switch from one mast to the next during conversation. As the user moves towards a mast it picks the strongest signal and releases the mast from which the signal has become weaker; that channel on that mast becomes available to another user. =Geolocation= Cellular geolocation is less precise than by GPS, but it is available to devices that do not have GPS receivers and where the GPS is not available. The precision of this system varies and is highest where advanced forward link methods are possible and is lowest where only a single cell site can be reached, in which case the location is only known to be within the coverage of that site. An advanced forward link is where a device is within range of at least three cell sites and where the carrier has implemented timing system use. Another method is using angle of arrival (AoA) and it occurs when the device is in range of at least two cell sites, produces intermediate precision. Assisted GPS uses both satellite and cell phone signals. In the United States, for emergency calling service using location data (locally called \\"Enhanced 911\\"), it was required that at least 95% of cellular phones in use on 31 December 2005 support such service. Many carriers missed this deadline and were fined by the Federal Communications Commission. = Radio power and health = The Federal Communications Commission, says: ::\\"Measurement data obtained from various sources have consistently indicated that 'worst-case' ground-level power densities near typical cellular towers are on the order of 1 ¬µW/cm¬≤ (or 10 mW/m¬≤) or less (usually significantly less).\\"Questions and Answers about Biological Effects and Potential Hazards of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields Fourth Edition. FCC. August 1999. Page 21. Retrieved 7 April 2013 Cell phones, cell towers, wi-fi, smart meters, DECT phones, cordless phones, baby monitors and other wireless devices all emit non-ionizing radio frequencies, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified as a \\"potential\\" carcinogen, although according to the National Cancer Institute \\"No mechanism by which ELF-EMFs or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified.\\"  Temporary sites  Although cell antennas are normally attached to permanent structures, carriers also maintain fleets of vehicles, called cells-on-wheels (COWs), that serve as temporary cell sites. A generator may be included for use where network electrical power is not available, and the system may have a wireless backhaul link allowing use where a wired link is not available. COWs are also used at permanent cell sites‚Äîas temporary replacements for damaged equipment, during planned outages, and to augment capacity such as during conventions. Cell on wheels (COW) Employment Cell site workers are called tower climbers or transmission tower workers. Transmission tower workers often work at heights of up to 1,500 feet (450 m), performing maintenance and repair work for cellular phone and other wireless communications companies. Spy agency setup According to documents leaked to Der Spiegel, the NSA sells a $40,000 \\"active GSM base station\\" to be used as a tool to mimic a mobile phone tower and thus monitor cell phones. In November 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Technical Operations Group of the U.S. Marshals utilizes spy devices, known as \\"dirtboxes\\", to mimic powerful cell tower signals. Such devices are designed to cause mobile phones to switch over to the tower, as it is the strongest signal within reach. The devices are placed on airplanes to effectively create a \\"dragnet\\", gathering data about phones as the planes travel above populated areas.  Off-grid systems  Ryse Energy Small Wind Turbine & Solar PV on a telecom tower An off-grid cell site is not connected to the public electrical grid. Usually the system is off-the-grid because of difficult access or lack of infrastructure. Fuel cell or other backup power systems are added to critical cell sites to provide day-today and emergency power. Traditionally sites have used internal-combustion-engine-driven generator sets,Ballard fuel cells to power telecom backup power units for motorola however, being less efficient than public power, they increase operating expense and are a source of pollution (atmospheric, acoustic, etc.) and some are in areas protected by environment and landscape conservation. Renewable sources, such as solar power and wind powerSuch as Wind-it tower may be available where cell sites are placed. This can reduce the cost of fuel to the cell site or telecom tower by upto 75% They can be backed up by a fuel generator system which allows the cell site to work when the renewable sources are not enough. One such energy production system consists of: In a recent case study, Ryse Energy reduced a cell sites monthly opex spend from US$1,300-1,500 using traditioanl diesel generations, to US$150 using a wind, solar and battery storage installation. Electrical energy from intermittent sources is stored in secondary batteries which are usually designed to have an average of 2 days of self-sufficiency, also known as automony, to allow time for maintenance personnel to arrive at site when a repair is needed. The renewable energy systems supply electrical power when available. The fuel cells are activated only when the natural sources are not enough to supply the energy the system needs. The emergency power supply (the fuel cells) is designed to last an average of 10 days. In this way the structure is completely self-sufficient: this enables the maintenance team to pay only few visits to the site, since it is usually hard to get to. Camouflage Camouflaged monopole, called \\"monopalm\\", in Tucson, Arizona There is often local opposition to new masts for reasons of safety and appearance. The latter is sometimes tackled by disguising the mast as something else, such as a flag pole, street lamp, or a tree (e.g. palm trees, pine trees, cypress) or rooftop structures or urban features such as chimneys or panels. These concealed cell sites can distinguish themselves by foliage shape and bark type. The foliage of all these antennas is composed of leaves made of plastic material accurately designed, taking into consideration quantity, shape and array suitable to completely conceal the antennas and all accessory parts in a natural manner. The materials used guarantee absolute radio-electric transparency and resistance to UVA rays. Nicknames include \\"monopalm\\" for a monopole disguised as a palm tree or \\"Pseudopinus telephoneyensis\\" for a mast disguised as a pine tree. In monopoles, the directional antennas are sometimes hidden in a plastic housing near the top of the pole so that the crossbars can be eliminated. An antenna colored to blend in with its host building, in Sopot, Poland Rooftop structures such as concealment chimneys or panels, 6 to 12 meters high, may conceal one or more mobile telephone operators on the same station. Roofmask panels can be fixed to existing rooftop structures, restyling them quickly and cheaply. Mobile telephone base stations are becoming a contemporary symbol, connected and intertwining with material and immaterial networks. Telestyles are architecturally blended cell towers, the result of cooperation with designers and architects. Miniature Researchers at Alcatel-Lucent have developed a cell site called lightRadio that fits in the palm of hand. It is the size of a Rubik's cube. It is capable of relaying 2G, 3G and 4G signals. They are more energy efficient and deliver broadband more efficiently than current cell sites. They could be used in very populated urban areas to make room for more radio space.The tiny cube that could cut your cell phone bill, CNN Money, 21 March 2011, David Goldman See also * Cellular network * Node B * OpenBTS * Mobile phone radiation and health * Telecom infrastructure sharing * Base transceiver station * Radio masts and towers * Mobile cell sites * Distributed antenna system * Telecommunications lease * Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations * In re Application of the United States for Historical Cell Site Data * Tower climber References External links *Maps of All Towers Across the United Kingdom *FCC: Universal Licensing Information *FCC: Information On Human Exposure To Radio frequency Fields From Cellular and PCS Radio Transmitters *Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) Base Station Survey 2007- 2011 Telecommunications infrastructure ","title":"Cell site"},{"id":"598346","text":"Capturing the Friedmans is a 2003 HBO documentary film directed by Andrew Jarecki. It focuses on the 1980s investigation of Arnold and Jesse Friedman for child molestation. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2003. Some of the Friedmans' alleged victims and family members wrote to the Awards Committee protesting the nomination, their identities confirmed but protected by the judge who presided over the court case. Production Jarecki initially was making a short film, Just a Clown, which he completed, about children's birthday party entertainers in New York, including the popular clown David Friedman (\\"Silly Billy\\"). During his research, Jarecki learned that David Friedman's brother, Jesse, and his father, Arnold, had pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, and the family had an archive of home movies. Jarecki interviewed some of the children involved and ended up making a film focusing on the Friedmans. Synopsis The investigation into Arnold Friedman's life started in 1987 after the U.S. Postal Service intercepted a magazine of child pornography received from the Netherlands. In searching his Great Neck, New York, home, investigators found a collection of child pornography. After learning that Friedman taught children computer classes from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students. The Friedmans were allowed to stay at home in order to prepare for court and took numerous home videos while Arnold Friedman (and, later, his son Jesse) awaited trial. The videos were not made with publishing in mind, but rather as a way to record what was happening in their lives. The movie shows much of this footage: family dinners, conversations and arguments. Arnold's wife, Elaine, was unsure of her husband's guilt and advised him to confess in order to protect their son; she soon divorced him. Arnold Friedman pleaded guilty to multiple charges of sodomy and sexual abuse. According to the Friedman family, he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time. Jesse Friedman later confessed as well but later claimed he did so to avoid being sent to prison for life. He said in mitigation that his father had molested him. According to Jesse's lawyer Peter Panaro, who visited Arnold in a Wisconsin federal prison, Arnold admitted to molesting two boys, but not those who attended his computer classes. He is also quoted as claiming that, when he was 13, he sexually abused his younger brother, Howard, who was eight years old at the time; Howard Friedman, interviewed in the movie, says he does not recall this. Jesse Friedman, in a subsequent statement, said that his father told him and his brothers that he sexually abused Howard.\\"Presentation by Jesse Friedman, May 17, 2012\\", http://www.freejesse.net/case-story, consulted 10-20-2014. Arnold Friedman died by suicide in prison in 1995, leaving a $250,000 life insurance benefit to Jesse. Jesse Friedman was released from New York's Clinton Correctional Facility in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence. Currently, he is running an online book-selling business. Reception The film received predominantly positive reviews. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 97% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The film was ranked as the 7th best-reviewed movie of 2003 on the website's best of the year list. The low-budget documentary was a success with audiences as well, grossing over $3 million in theaters and making it a surprise hit. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Jarecki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant.\\" He praised Jarecki for operating under the premise \\"that first impressions can't be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story.\\" The Washington Post columnist Desson Howe offered similar praise, writing, \\"It's testament to Jarecki's superbly wrought film that everyone seems to be, simultaneously, morally suspect and strikingly innocent as they relate their stories and assertions...This is a film about the quagmire of mystery in every human soul.\\" Similarly, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"The film is as an instructive lesson about the elusiveness of facts, especially in a legal context. Sometimes guilt and innocence are discovered in court, but sometimes, we gather, only truths about the law are demonstrated.\\" The film won the Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for 2003. Capturing the Friedmans was voted the fifth film in the 2005 Channel 4 programme The 50 Greatest Documentaries. In one of the few negative reviews, Los Angeles Times writer Kenneth Turan wrote a critique of both the film and Jarecki, stating, \\"Jarecki's pose of impartiality gets especially troublesome for audiences when it enables him to evade responsibility for dealing with the complexities of his material.\\" Criticism intensified as Jarecki's choice not to pursue his firm belief in the Friedmans' innocence became publicly known. In his review, Ebert had recounted Jarecki's statement at the Sundance Film Festival that he did not know whether Arnold and Jesse Friedman were guilty of child molestation. Ebert roundly praised Jarecki for communicating this ambiguity. It has since emerged that Jarecki funded Jesse Friedman's appeal. Writing for The Village Voice, Debbie Nathan ‚Äì who was hired by Jarecki as a consultant after having been interviewed for the film ‚Äì wrote of Jarecki, \\"Polling viewers at Sundance in January, he was struck by how they were split over Arnold and Jesse's guilt. Since then, he's crafted a marketing strategy based on ambiguity, and during Q&As; and interviews, he has studiously avoided taking a stand.\\". There was a critical blacklash due to footage the director left out on purpose. Jarecki's film omitted a third co-defendant, Ross Goldstein, a teenage neighbor who also pleaded guilty to charges of child molestation and who corroborated some of the children's accusations at the time and went to prison. Jarecki also omitted a tearful confession of guilt by Jesse Friedman in prison on Geraldo Rivera‚Äôs talk show in 1989. Jesse Friedman detailed how his father had molested him as a child. Additional materials The 2003 DVD release included a second DVD: \\"Capturing the Friedmans - Outside the Frame\\". It included: * Unseen home movies (\\"Passover Seder\\", \\"Grandma Speaks\\", \\"Jesse's Last Night\\") * Great Neck Outraged. * New Witnesses and Evidence. * Uncut footage of the prosecution's star witness. * Friedman family scrapbook and hidden audio tapes. * Just a Clown (the 20-minute short featuring David Friedman that led to Capturing the Friedmans). * Jesse's Life Today. * An altercation at the film's New York premiere. * The Judge (Abbey Boklan) speaks out at the Great Neck premiere. * A ROM section with key documents from the family and the case. The materials show an altercation from a discussion period following the film's premiere in which the retired head of the Nassau County Police's Sex Crimes Unit Frances Galasso argues with Debbie Nathan, as well as a speech by trial judge Abbey Boklan from the showing in Great Neck. Both made the claim that the film had ignored relevant evidence of Jesse's guilt. This evidence included his appearance on the Geraldo Rivera show, when Jesse confessed to sexually abusing children,The recording of this video has not been released publicly, as of 2016. and the fact that there was another defendant (Ross Goldstein), who turned state's evidence and pleaded guilty, and two other unindicted co-conspirators. (Goldstein is not named in the film but it is said in one of the other DVD extras that he declined to be interviewed. One of the unindicted co-conspirators claims in the same section that both were accused falsely by Goldstein.) In the video of the discussion period, Jesse's lawyer at the time, Peter Panaro, said that he had advised Jesse not to appear on Rivera's talk show (Panaro was also present on the show), and in fact had Jesse sign an affidavit saying that he was doing so against legal advice. Subsequent legal developments In August 2010, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of Jesse Friedman on technical legal grounds, but took the unusual step of urging prosecutors to reopen Friedman's case, saying that there was a \\"reasonable likelihood that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted\\". The decision cited \\"overzealousness\\" by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s. Following the appeals court ruling, the Nassau District Attorney's office began a three-year investigation led by District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice. On June 24, 2013, the report was released. In a 155-page report, the district attorney's office concluded that none of four issues raised in a strongly-worded 2010 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit were substantiated by the evidence. Instead, it concluded, \\"By any impartial analysis, the reinvestigation process prompted by Jesse Friedman, his advocates and the Second Circuit, has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman's guilty plea and adjudication as a sex offender.\\" Jesse Friedman was regarded as a \\"narcissist\\" and a \\"psychopathic deviant\\" by a psychiatrist his attorney hired to conduct an evaluation. Boklan had been subject to \\"selectively edited and misleading film portrayals in Capturing the Friedmans\\". A four-member independent advisory panel guided and oversaw the work. It included Barry Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, one of the country's leading advocates for overturning wrongful convictions, and a member of O.J. Simpson's defense team. However, Scheck has subsequently complained that key documents were not available to the panel, and urged the matter be reopened. Prior to the report's release, details emerged, including letters from some of the alleged victims in which they recant their accusations and implicate the police in coercing their statements. Prior to the report's release, The Village Voice conducted an interview with Jesse Friedman, who described himself as \\"freakishly optimistic\\", and also reported that Ross Goldstein, a childhood friend of Jesse Friedman's, had broken his 25-year silence to explain he had been coerced into cooperating with the district attorney's office: \\"He told the review panel of how he'd been coerced into lying, how prosecutors coached him through details of the Friedmans' computer lab, which he'd never even seen, and how he was imprisoned for something he'd never done.\\" On February 10, 2015, Jesse Friedman was back in state appellate court seeking to have Nassau County prosecutors turn over to him the remainder of their evidence against him. A state Appeals Court found, in December 2015, that the prosecutors did not have to release the records. According to a spokesperson for the Nassau County District Attorney, because Friedman pleaded guilty and there was no trial, the records of witnesses who did not testify are confidential, and the law does not mandate their disclosure.

The related abstract noun - banausia is defined by Hesychius as \\"every craft () [conducted] by means of fire\\", reflecting the folk etymology of the word as coming from (baunos) \\"furnace\\" and (au≈ç) \\"to dry\\".Banausie. In: Heinrich August Pierer, Julius L√∂be (in German): Universal-Lexikon der Gegenwart und Vergangenheit. Fourth ed., vol. 2; Altenburg 1857, page 264 (Online bei zeno.org) The actual etymology of the words is unknown; they are not attested outside Attic-Ionic or before the 5th century BC. The epic heroes call their smiths - dƒìmiourgoi. Athenian usage The use of banausos follows an economic transition in Greece: the use of coinage, the invention of the trireme and of hoplite armor, the prevalence of chattel slavery permitted the rise of a new hoplite class, who used the term to distance themselves from the artisans. Banausos was used as a term of invective, meaning \\"cramped in body\\" (Politics 1341 a 7) and \\"vulgar in taste\\" (1337 b 7), by the extreme oligarchs in Athens in the 5th century BC, who were led by Critias. In this usage, it refers to the laboring class as a whole; i.e. the artisans, such as potters, stonemasons, carpenters, professional singers, artists, musicians, and all persons engaged in trade or retail. It makes no distinction between slave or free. These extreme oligarchs were opposed both to the moderate oligarchs, such as Theramenes, and to the democrats, such as Pericles, Cleon, and Thrasybulus. They held power at Athens for less than a year, with the assistance of a Spartan army; because of their use of exile, purges, midnight arrests, and judicial murder, are remembered as the Thirty Tyrants. But while they vanished from the political scene, the word remained. Philosophers Plato, the philosopher, was Critias's nephew, and used banausos in much the same sense, although in the Republic he preferred the installation of philosophers, such as himself, above the hoplites, who were in turn above the artisan. It was also current among the first generation of his pupils, such as Aristotle, who writes, \\"Those who provide necessaries for an individual are slaves, and those who provide them for society are handicraftsmen and day-laborers.\\" Plato further held that commerce had a corrupting influence in communities and acquisition of wealth destroyed their - homonoia (like-mindedness) and was the principal cause of - stasis (faction). He also held that \\"merchants and craftsmen would be less willing to defend the civic territory than farmers would\\" and commerce and mercantilism had a morally corrupting influence. Plato was concerned with the \\"best\\" state, which requires citizens who are the best and because they possess arete. This is in contrast to the attitude, cited by Heraclitus: \\"We will have none best among us; if any among us would be the best, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\\" Plato argued, and Aristotle follows him in this, although not in other things, that the pursuit of arete required leisure. Technical education was necessary but did not make good citizens. Leisure was a necessity of good citizenship ‚Äì something the banausoi do not have. Banausia deforms the body, rendering it useless for military and political duties. Those occupations tire out the body and therefore the mind preventing self-education by reading and conversing with others. \\"It accustoms a man's mind to low ideas, and absorbs him in the pursuit of the mere means of life.\\" Plato and Aristotle teach that the highest thing in man is reason and therefore, the purpose of human perfection lies with the activity of reason; i.e. the 'theoretic' or contemplative life. Trade, industry and mechanical labour prevent this idea. These activities are necessary for a good human condition of life but when these activities are merely regarded as means to making money and not as acts of service to truth, service to others and arete, then these, occupations become base. After the time of Alexander the Great, however, philosophers largely avoided practical politics. Thereafter banausos mostly appears in glossaries to Plato and Aristotle. Later philosophic schools had different politics. For example, Cassius Dio defined democracy (dƒìmokrate√≠a) thus: \\"when every man gets the honor that is his due.\\" Revivals It has been conjectured that the Elizabethan use of \\"mechanical\\" (as in e.g. Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream) is a translation of banausos. This is certainly possible -- the earliest recorded use of \\"mechanical\\" (OED s.v.) is from John Lyly, who used a linguistic style with many influences from Greek. Banausos (or rather - banausikos) has also been adapted into English, as the rare word banausic, both as a term of abuse, and to represent Greek usage. According to Dagobert D. Runes' Dictionary of Philosophy, it means \\"vulgar and illiberal\\", particularly when referring to arts or occupations that \\"deform the body or the mind.\\" Its use in English is not found before 1845, with the Victorian revival of classical learning. One of the contributions of classical philology to the Kultur-movement in Wilhelmine and post-Wilhelmine Germany was the use of banausisch as an insult -- along with the myths that the German Soul is essentially Greek, that the ancient Greeks were blond, and that the modern Greeks are not descended from them. Today in German Banause is used to mean an uncouth person indifferent to high culture, like English philistine. These ideas have become less accepted since World War II, but they were occasionally reflected in the English-speaking world. For example, Edith Hamilton accepted them as the best scholarship of her school days. Again, a junior colleague of Sir Gilbert Murray permitted himself (in 1935) the following, which goes well beyond Greek usage: :The aim of a journalist may either be to enlarge the circulation of a paper or to give his readers a true and intelligent picture of the world; of a lawyer either to extend his practice or to help justice be done; of a business man either to grow rich or to play his part as a 'nurse' of the community. These alternatives are not exclusive. But where the former predominates, the amount of arete generated will be small, and journalists, lawyers and industrialists will be banausoi rather than men.

Elvis Weinstein, is an American writer and performer, best known for his roles as Dr. Laurence Erhardt and the original puppeteer and voice for Tom Servo and Gypsy on Mystery Science Theater 3000. He should not be confused with the similarly named Josh Weinstein, longtime writer on The Simpsons. Mystery Science Theater 3000 Weinstein was one of the founding writers/performers of the show in 1988 at the age of 17. Weinstein worked on Mystery Science Theater 3000 during its original appearance on Minneapolis UHF station KTMA-TV from 1988 to 1989, and its first season on Comedy Central (then called the Comedy Channel) from 1989 to 1990. However, a significant age gap existed between him and the other cast members; he was only 17 when he joined the show, having been recruited by Joel from his \\"Creative Stand-Up and Smartology\\" comedy classes. This ultimately led to Weinstein feeling unhappy with the more professional approach to the show the move to the Comedy Channel demanded, and caused him to leave the show.https://www.youtube.com/v/I3tP8bxfV-s In an April 2019 episode of Bill Corbett‚Äôs Funhouse podcast, Weinstein elaborated on his experience at Best Brains, claiming that MST3K producer, Jim Mallon, was openly hostile toward him and used the age disparity between him and the rest of the cast as a pretext for paying him significantly less for his work on the show than his cohorts. In 2018, Weinstein returned to the show, providing guest appearances in two of the twelfth season's episodes. Work after MST3K After leaving Mystery Science Theater 3000, Weinstein became a writer for The Young Person's Guide to Becoming a Rock Star and Malcolm and Eddie; he also served as writer and producer for the NBC dramedy Freaks and Geeks. He changed his professional name from \\"Josh\\" to \\"J. Elvis\\" to avoid confusion with former Simpsons writer Josh Weinstein. He was head writer for NBC's late night show Later with Greg Kinnear and America's Funniest Home Videos. Weinstein has an extensive background in stand-up comedy; he has performed over a thousand shows as a stand-up comedian, and has written material for Garry Shandling, Dennis Miller, Roseanne Barr, Louie Anderson and other comedians. He is currently the president of Stinkburger Inc. He appeared in the 2010 science fiction computer game DARKSTAR - The Interactive Movie as Captain Cedrick Stone of the Galactic Discovery II.DARKSTAR on Satellite News Weinstein currently cohosts the weekly podcast Thought Spiral with friend and fellow comedian Andy Kindler.

Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa. Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film Come Back, Africa, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government. Makeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \\"Pata Pata\\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several independence celebrations. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song \\"Soweto Blues\\", written by her former husband Hugh Masekela, was about the Soweto uprising. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with Nina Simone and Dizzy Gillespie, and appeared in the 1992 film Sarafina!. She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy. Makeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several songs critical of apartheid, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President Nelson Mandela said that \\"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\\" Early years =Childhood and family= Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black township of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, was a sangoma, or traditional healer, and a domestic worker. Her Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered \\"uzenzile\\", a Xhosa word that means \\"you brought this on yourself\\", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name \\"Zenzile\\". When Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language. The family moved to the Transvaal when Makeba was a child. After her father's death, she was forced to find employment; she did domestic work, and worked as a nanny. She described herself as a shy person at the time. Her mother worked for white families in Johannesburg, and had to live away from her six children. Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria. Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career. In 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, Bongi Makeba, in 1950. Makeba was then diagnosed with breast cancer, and her husband, who was said to have beaten her, left her shortly afterwards, after a two-year marriage. A decade later she overcame cervical cancer via a hysterectomy. =Early career= Makeba began her professional musical career with the Cuban Brothers, a South African all-male close harmony group, with whom she sang covers of popular American songs. Soon afterwards, at the age of 21, she joined a jazz group, the Manhattan Brothers, who sang a mixture of South African songs and pieces from popular African- American groups. Makeba was the only woman in the group. With the Manhattan Brothers she recorded her first hit, \\"Laku Tshoni Ilanga\\", in 1953, and developed a national reputation as a musician. In 1956 she joined a new all- woman group, the Skylarks, singing a blend of jazz and traditional South African melodies. Formed by Gallotone Records, the group was also known as the Sunbeams. Makeba sang with the Skylarks when the Manhattan Brothers were travelling abroad; later, she also travelled with the Manhattan Brothers. In the Skylarks, Makeba sang alongside Rhodesian-born musician Dorothy Masuka, whose music Makeba had followed, along with that of Dolly Rathebe. Several of the Skylarks' pieces from this period became popular; the music historian Rob Allingham later described the group as \\"real trendsetters, with harmonisation that had never been heard before.\\" Makeba received no royalties from her work with the Skylarks. While performing with the Manhattan Brothers in 1955, Makeba met Nelson Mandela, then a young lawyer; he later remembered the meeting, and that he felt that the girl he met \\"was going to be someone.\\" In 1956, Gallotone Records released \\"Lovely Lies\\", Makeba's first solo success; the Xhosa lyric about a man looking for his beloved in jails and hospitals was replaced with the unrelated and innocuous line \\"You tell such lovely lies with your two lovely eyes\\" in the English version. The record became the first South African record to chart on the United States Billboard Top 100. In 1957, Makeba was featured on the cover of Drum magazine. alt=A young black man singing In 1959, Makeba sang the lead female role in the Broadway-inspired South African jazz opera King Kong; among those in the cast was the musician Hugh Masekela. The musical was performed to racially integrated audiences, raising her profile among white South Africans. Also in 1959, she had a short guest appearance in Come Back, Africa, an anti-apartheid film produced and directed by the American independent filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. Rogosin cast her after seeing her on stage in African Jazz and Variety show, on which Makeba was a performer for 18 months. The film blended elements of documentary and fiction and had to be filmed in secret as the government was expected to be hostile to it. Makeba appeared on stage, and sang two songs: her appearance lasted four minutes. The cameo made an enormous impression on viewers, and Rogosin organised a visa for her to attend the premiere of the film at the twenty-fourth Venice Film Festival in Italy, where the film won the prestigious Critics' Choice Award. Makeba's presence has been described as crucial to the film, as an emblem of cosmopolitan black identity that also connected with working-class black people due to the dialogue being in Zulu. Makeba's role in Come Back, Africa brought her international recognition and she travelled to London and New York to perform. In London she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became her mentor, helping her with her first solo recordings. These included \\"Pata Pata\\", which would be released many years later, and a version of the traditional Xhosa song \\"Qongqothwane\\", which she had first performed with the Skylarks. Though \\"Pata Pata\\"‚Äîdescribed by Musician magazine as a \\"groundbreaking Afropop gem\\"‚Äîbecame her most famous song, Makeba described it as \\"one of my most insignificant songs\\". While in England, she married Sonny Pillay, a South African ballad singer of Indian descent; they divorced within a few months. Makeba then moved to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on The Steve Allen Show in Los Angeles for a television audience of 60 million. Her New York debut at the Village Vanguard occurred soon after; she sang in Xhosa and Zulu, and performed a Yiddish folk song. Her audience at this concert included Miles Davis and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in Greenwich Village, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, and worked as a babysitter for a period. Exile =United States= Breakthrough Soon after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, Makeba learned that her mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa. Her musical career in the US continued to flourish. She signed a recording contract with RCA Victor, and released Miriam Makeba, her first studio album, in 1960, backed by Belafonte's band. RCA Victor chose to buy out Makeba's contract with Gallotone Records, and despite the fact that Makeba was unable to perform in South Africa, Gallotone received US$45,000 in the deal, which meant that Makeba received no royalties for her debut album. The album included one of her most famous hits in the US, \\"Qongqothwane\\", which was known in English as \\"The Click Song\\" because Makeba's audiences could not pronounce the Xhosa name. Time magazine called her the \\"most exciting new singing talent to appear in many years\\", and Newsweek compared her voice to \\"the smoky tones and delicate phrasing\\" of Ella Fitzgerald and the \\"intimate warmth\\" of Frank Sinatra. The album was not commercially successful, and Makeba was briefly dropped from RCA Victor: she was re-signed soon after as the label recognised the commercial possibilities of the growing interest in African culture. Her South African identity had been downplayed during her first signing, but it was strongly emphasised the second time to take advantage of this interest. Makeba made several appearances on television, often in the company of Belafonte. In 1962, Makeba and Belafonte sang at the birthday party for US President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, but Makeba did not go to the party afterwards because she was ill. Kennedy nevertheless insisted on meeting her, so Belafonte sent a car to pick her up. In 1964, Makeba released her second studio album for RCA Victor, The World of Miriam Makeba. An early example of world music, the album peaked at number eighty-six on the Billboard 200. Makeba's music had a cross-racial appeal in the US; white Americans were attracted to her image as an \\"exotic\\" African performer, and black Americans related their own experiences of racial segregation to Makeba's struggle against apartheid. Makeba found company among other African exiles and √©migr√©s in New York, including Hugh Masekela, to whom she was married from 1963 to 1968. During their marriage, Makeba and Masekela were neighbours of the jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie in Englewood, New Jersey; they spent much of their time in Harlem. She also came to know actors Marlon Brando and Lauren Bacall, and musicians Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles. Fellow singer-activist Nina Simone became friendly with Makeba, as did actor Cicely Tyson; Makeba and Simone performed together at Carnegie Hall. Makeba was among black entertainers, activists, and intellectuals in New York at the time who believed that the civil rights movement and popular culture could reinforce each other, creating \\"a sense of intertwined political and cultural vibrancy\\"; other examples included Maya Angelou and Sidney Poitier. She later described her difficulty living with racial segregation, saying \\"There wasn't much difference in America; it was a country that had abolished slavery but there was apartheid in its own way.\\" Travel and activism Makeba being welcomed during a visit to Israel in 1963 Makeba's music was also popular in Europe, and she travelled and performed there frequently. Acting on the advice of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country's independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa's National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became a stateless person, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. In her life, she held nine passports, and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries. Soon after her testimony, Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia, invited her to sing at the inauguration of the Organisation of African Unity, the only performer to be invited. As the fact of her ban from South Africa became well known she became a cause c√©l√©bre for Western liberals, and her presence in the civil rights movement provided a link between that movement and the anti-apartheid struggle. In 1964 she was taught the song \\"Malaika\\" by a Kenyan student while backstage at a performance in San Francisco; the song later became a staple of her performances. Throughout the 1960s, Makeba strengthened her involvement with a range of black-centred political movements, including the civil rights, anti-apartheid, Black Consciousness, and Black Power movements. She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist Stokely Carmichael‚Äîthe leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party‚Äîafter Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba's concerts; they met again in Conakry six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family. Makeba participated in fundraising activities for various civil rights groups, including a benefit concert for the 1962 Southern Christian Leadership Conference that civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as the \\"event of the year\\". Following a concert and rally in Atlanta in support of King, Makeba and others were denied entrance to a restaurant as a result of Jim Crow laws, leading to a televised protest in front of the establishment. She also criticised King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference for its investment in South African companies, informing press that \\"Now my friend of long standing supports the country's persecution of my people and I must find a new idol\\". Her identity as an African woman in the civil rights movement helped create \\"an emerging liberal consensus\\" that extreme racial discrimination, whether domestically or internationally, was harmful. In 1964 she testified at the UN for a second time, quoting a song by Vanessa Redgrave in calling for quick action against the South African government. On 15 March 1966, Makeba and Belafonte received the Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording for An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. The album dealt with the political plight of black South Africans under apartheid, including several songs critical of the South African government, such as \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (\\"Watch our Verwoerd\\", a reference to Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of apartheid). It sold widely and raised Makeba's profile in the US; Belafonte and Makeba's concert tour following its release was often sold out, and the album has been described as the best they made together. Makeba's use of lyrics in Swahili, Xhosa, and Sotho led to her being seen as a representation of an \\"authentic\\" Africa by American audiences. In 1967, more than ten years after she first recorded the song, the single \\"Pata Pata\\" was released in the US on an album of the same title, and became a worldwide hit. During its recording, she and Belafonte had a disagreement, after which they stopped recording together. =Guinea= Makeba in 1969 Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image that alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Tour√©. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987. Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© and his wife, Andr√©e. Tour√© wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what S√©kou Tour√© did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970 (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974. Makeba performed more frequently in African countries, and as countries became independent of European colonial powers, was invited to sing at independence ceremonies, including in Kenya, Angola, Zambia, Tanganyika, and Mozambique. In September 1974 she performed alongside a multitude of well-known African and American musicians at the Zaire 74 festival in Kinshasa, Zaire (formerly the Congo). She also became a diplomat for Ghana, and was appointed Guinea's official delegate to the UN in 1975; that year, she addressed the United Nations General Assembly. She continued to perform in Europe and Asia, as well as her African concerts, but not in the US, where a de facto boycott was in effect. Her performances in Africa were immensely popular: she was described as the highlight of FESTAC 77, a Pan- African arts festival in Nigeria in 1977, and during a Liberian performance of \\"Pata Pata\\", the stadium proved so loud that she was unable to complete the song. \\"Pata Pata\\", like her other songs, had been banned in South Africa. Another song she sang frequently in this period was \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\", though she never recorded it. Makeba later stated that it was during this period that she accepted the label \\"Mama Africa\\". In 1976, the South African government replaced English with Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in all schools, setting off the Soweto uprising. Between 15,000 and 20,000 students took part; caught unprepared, the police opened fire on the protesting children, killing hundreds and injuring more than a thousand. Hugh Masekela wrote \\"Soweto Blues\\" in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Makeba, becoming a staple of her live performances for many years. A review in the magazine Musician said that the song had \\"searingly righteous lyrics\\" about the uprising that \\"cut to the bone\\". She had separated from Carmichael in 1973; in 1978 they divorced and in 1981 she married Bageot Bah, an airline executive. =Belgium= Makeba's daughter Bongi, who was a singer in her own right and had often accompanied her mother on stage, died in childbirth in 1985. Makeba was left responsible for her two grandchildren, and decided to move out of Guinea. She settled in the Woluwe-Saint-Lambert district of the Belgian capital Brussels. In the following year, Masekela introduced Makeba to Paul Simon, and a few months later she embarked on Simon's very successful Graceland Tour. The tour concluded with two concerts held in Harare, Zimbabwe, which were filmed in 1987 for release as Graceland: The African Concert. After touring the world with Simon, Warner Bros. Records signed Makeba and she released Sangoma (\\"Healer\\"), an album of healing chants named in honour of her sangoma mother. Her involvement with Simon caused controversy: Graceland had been recorded in South Africa, breaking the cultural boycott of the country, and thus Makeba's participation in the tour was regarded as contravening the boycott (which Makeba herself endorsed). In preparation for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled Makeba: My Story. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She took part in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London's Wembley Stadium, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison. Return to South Africa, final years and death Following growing pressure from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to return to South Africa, which she did, using her French passport, on 10 June 1990. Makeba and Dizzy Gillespie in Calvados, France, 1991 Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, Eyes on Tomorrow, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&B;, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, The Cosby Show. In 1992, she starred in the film Sarafina!, which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising. Makeba portrayed the title character's mother, Angelina, a role which The New York Times described as having been performed with \\"immense dignity\\". On 16 October 1999, Makeba was named a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, Homeland, produced by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Gra√ßa Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony, which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba's second autobiography, Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances. On 9 November 2008, Makeba fell ill during a concert in Castel Volturno, near Caserta, Italy. The concert had been organised to support the writer Roberto Saviano in his stand against the Camorra, a criminal organisation active in the Campania region. She suffered a heart attack after singing her hit song \\"Pata Pata\\", and was taken to the Pineta Grande clinic, where doctors were unable to revive her. Music and image =Musical style= The groups with which Makeba began her career performed mbube, a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music. Johannesburg musician Dolly Rathebe was an early influence on Makeba's music, as were female jazz singers from the US. Historian David Coplan writes that the \\"African jazz\\" made popular by Makeba and others was \\"inherently hybridized\\" rather than derivative of any particular genre, blending as it did marabi and jazz, and was \\"Americanized African music, not Africanized American music\\". The music that she performed was described by British writer Robin Denselow as a \\"unique blend of rousing township styles and jazz-influenced balladry\\". Makeba released more than 30 albums during her career. The dominant styles of these shifted over time, moving from African jazz to recordings influenced by Belafonte's \\"crooning\\" to music drawing from traditional South African musical forms. She has been associated with the genres of world music and Afropop. She also incorporated Latin American musical styles into her performances. Historian Ruth Feldstein described her music as \\"[crossing] the borders between what many people associated with avant-garde and 'quality' culture and the commercial mainstream\\"; the latter aspect often drew criticism. She was able to appeal to audiences from many political, racial, and national backgrounds. She was known for having a dynamic vocal range, and was described as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she \\"could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language.\\" She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, the language of the apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated \\"When Afrikaaners sing in my language, then I will sing theirs.\\" English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride. =Politics and perception= Makeba said that she did not perform political music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated \\"people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth\\", an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying \\"In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate.\\" Makeba's use of the clicks common in languages such as Xhosa and Zulu (as in \\"Qongqothwane\\", \\"The Click Song\\") was frequently remarked upon by Western audiences. It contributed to her popularity and her exotic image, which scholars have described as a kind of othering, exacerbated by the fact that Western audiences often could not understand her lyrics. Critics in the US described her as the \\"African tribeswoman\\" and as an \\"import from South Africa\\", often depicting her in condescending terms as a product of a more primitive society. Commentators also frequently described her in terms of the prominent men she was associated with, despite her own prominence. During her early career in South Africa she had been seen as a sex symbol, an image that received considerably less attention in the US. Makeba was described as a style icon, both in her home country and the US. She wore no makeup and refused to straighten her hair for shows, thus helping establish a style that came to be known internationally as the \\"Afro look\\". According to music scholar Tanisha Ford, her hairstyle represented a \\"liberated African beauty aesthetic\\". She was seen as a beauty icon by South African schoolgirls, who were compelled to shorten their hair by the apartheid government. Makeba stuck to wearing African jewellery; she disapproved of the skin-lighteners common among South African women at the time, and refused to appear in advertisements for them. Her self-presentation has been characterised by scholars as a rejection of the predominantly white standards of beauty that women in the US were held to, which allowed Makeba to partially escape the sexualisation directed at women performers during this period. Nonetheless, the terms used to describe her in the US media have been identified by scholars as frequently used to \\"sexualize, infantalize, and animalize\\" people of African heritage. Legacy =Musical influence= Makeba has been credited with popularising world music, along with artists such as Youssou N'Dour, Salif Keita, Ang√©lique Kidjo, Ali Farka Tour√©, and Baaba Maal (pictured clockwise from top left). Makeba was among the most visible Africans in the US; as a result, she was often emblematic of the continent of Africa for Americans. Her music earned her the moniker \\"Mama Africa\\", and she was variously described as the \\"Empress of African Song\\", the \\"Queen of South African music\\", and Africa's \\"first superstar\\". Music scholar J. U. Jacobs said that Makeba's music had \\"both been shaped by and given shape to black South African and American music\\". The jazz musician Abbey Lincoln is among those identified as being influenced by Makeba. Makeba and Simone were among a group of artists who helped shape soul music. Longtime collaborator Belafonte called her \\"the most revolutionary new talent to appear in any medium in the last decade\\". Speaking after her death, Mandela called her \\"South Africa's first lady of song\\", and said that \\"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\\" Outside her home country Makeba was credited with bringing African music to a Western audience, and along with artists such as Youssou N'Dour, Salif Keita, Ali Farka Tour√©, Baaba Maal and Ang√©lique Kidjo, with popularising the genre of world music. Her work with Belafonte in the 1960s has been described as creating the genre of world music before the concept entered the popular imagination, and also as highlighting the diversity and cultural pluralism within African music. Within South Africa, Makeba has been described as influencing artists such as kwaito musician Thandiswa Mazwai and her band Bongo Maffin, whose track \\"De Makeba\\" was a modified version of Makeba's \\"Pata Pata\\", and one of several tribute recordings released after her return to South Africa. South African jazz musician Simphiwe Dana has been described as \\"the new Miriam Makeba\\". South African singer Lira has frequently been compared with Makeba, particularly for her performance of \\"Pata Pata\\" during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Football World Cup. A year later, Kidjo dedicated her concert in New York to Makeba, as a musician who had \\"paved the way for her success\\". In an obituary, scholar Lara Allen referred to Makeba as \\"arguably South Africa's most famous musical export\\". In 2016 the French singer Jain released \\"Makeba\\", a tribute. =Activism= Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white- minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\" Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: \\"Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period\\". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that \\"black is beautiful\\". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting \\"that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex\\". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the \\"most steadfast voices for social justice\\". =Awards and recognition= Makeba's 1965 collaboration with Harry Belafonte won a Grammy Award, making her the first African recording artist to win this award. Makeba shared the 2001 Polar Music Prize with Sofia Gubaidulina. They received their prize from Carl XVI Gustaf, the King of Sweden, during a nationally televised ceremony at Berwaldhallen, Stockholm, on 27 May 2002. Makeba won the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Peace Prize in 1986, and in 2001 was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold by the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin, \\"for outstanding services to peace and international understanding\\". She also received several honorary doctorates. In 2004, she was voted 38th in a poll ranking 100 Great South Africans. Mama Africa, a musical about Makeba, was produced in South Africa by Niyi Coker. Originally titled Zenzi!, the musical premiered to a sold-out crowd in Cape Town on 26 May 2016. It was performed in the US in St. Louis, Missouri and at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City between October and December 2016. The musical returned to South Africa in February 2017 for what would have been Makeba's 85th birthday. From 25 to 27 September 2009, a tribute television show to Makeba entitled Hommage √† Miriam Makeba and curated by Beninoise singer-songwriter and activist Ang√©lique Kidjo, was held at the Cirque d'hiver in Paris. The show was presented as Mama Africa: Celebrating Miriam Makeba at the Barbican in London on 21 November 2009. A documentary film titled Mama Africa, about Makeba's life, co-written and directed by Finnish director Mika Kaurism√§ki, was released in 2011. On 4 March 2013, and again on International Women's Day in 2017, Google honoured her with a Google Doodle on their homepage. In 2014 she was honoured (along with Nelson Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and Steve Biko) in the Belgian city of Ghent, which named a square after her, the \\"Miriam Makebaplein\\".

In many cultures the metal silver is generally valuable but less so than gold. Greek myth The original silver age (ŒëœÅŒ≥œÖœÅœåŒΩ ŒìŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ) was the second of the five \\"Ages of Man\\" described by the ancient poet Hesiod in his poem Works and Days, following the Golden age and preceding the Bronze Age. These people lived for one hundred years as children without growing up, then suddenly aged and died. Zeus destroyed these people because of their impiety, in the Ogygian Deluge. After Kronos was exiled, the world was ruled by Zeus. As a result of Pandora releasing the evils upon the world, a second generation of men and the age was called silver because the race of man was less noble than the race of the Golden Age. In the silver age Zeus reduced the spring, and reconstructed the year into four seasons, so that men for the first time sought the shelter of houses and had to labor to supply their food. The first seeds of grain were placed in the ground since now man had to gather their own food. A child grew up at his mother's side a hundred years, but adulthood lasted a short time. Being less noble than the Golden Age, humanity could not keep from fighting with one another, nor would they properly honor and or serve the immortals. The actions of the second generation infuriated Zeus, so in punishment he destroyed them. Other silver ages The term has been applied to a number of other periods following a \\"Golden Age\\", including: * The Silver Age of Latin literature * The Silver Age of Comic Books, the 2000 DC Comics series Silver Age was named after the period * The Silver Age of Russian Poetry * The Silver Age of Alpinism * The Treta Yuga of Vedic philosophy of the ages.

It is used to polish, passivate, and deburr metal parts. It is often described as the reverse of electroplating. It may be used in lieu of abrasive fine polishing in microstructural preparation.G.F. Vander Voort, ed., \\"Chemical and Electrolytic Polishing,\\" ASM Handbook, Vol. 9: Metallography and Microstructures, ASM International, 2004, p 281-293, . Mechanism Electropolishing principle: 1\\\\. Electrolyte 2\\\\. Cathode 3\\\\. Work-piece to polish (Anode) 4\\\\. Particle moving from the work-piece to the cathode 5\\\\. Surface before polishing 6\\\\. Surface after polishing Typically, the work-piece is immersed in a temperature-controlled bath of electrolyte and serves as the anode; it is connected to the positive terminal of a DC power supply, the negative terminal being attached to the cathode. A current passes from the anode, where metal on the surface is oxidised and dissolved in the electrolyte, to the cathode. At the cathode, a reduction reaction occurs, which normally produces hydrogen. Electrolytes used for electropolishing are most often concentrated acid solutions having a high viscosity, such as mixtures of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. Other electropolishing electrolytes reported in the literature include mixtures of perchloric acid with acetic anhydride (which has caused fatal explosions), and methanolic solutions of sulfuric acid. To electropolish a rough surface, the protruding parts of a surface profile must dissolve faster than the recesses. This process, referred to as anodic levelling, can be subject to incorrect analysis when measuring the surface topography. Anodic dissolution under electropolishing conditions deburrs metal objects due to increased current density on corners and burrs. Most importantly, successful electropolishing should operate under diffusion limited constant current plateau, achieved by following current dependence on voltage (polarisation curve), under constant temperature and stirring conditions. Applications Due to its ease of operation and its usefulness in polishing irregularly-shaped objects, electropolishing has become a common process in the production of semiconductors. As electropolishing can also be used to sterilize workpieces, the process plays an essential role in the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.https://www.thefabricator.com/article/finishing/electropolishing- applications-and-techniques\\"7 Industries That Depend on Electropolishing\\". https://www.electro-glo.com/7-industries-that-depend-on-electropolishing/ It is commonly used in the post-production of large metal pieces such as those used in drums of washing machines, bodies of ocean vessels and aircraft, and automobiles.https://www.ableelectropolishing.com/industry- solutions/aerospace/https://www.electro-glo.com/about-us/ While nearly any metal may be electropolished, the most-commonly polished metals are 300- and 400-series stainless steel, aluminum, copper, titanium, and nickel- and copper-alloys.https://www.delstar.com/metals-that-can-be- electropolishedhttps://www.electro-glo.com/electropolishing-products/ Ultra- high vacuum (UHV) components are typically electropolished in order to have a smoother surface for improved vacuum pressures, out-gassing rates, and pumping speed. Electropolishing is commonly used to prepare thin metal samples for transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography because the process does not mechanically deform surface layers like mechanical polishing does.

In a style written for the general audience, the book covers what modern psychology knows about the reasons for some of the most important aspects of human behavior. Contents Aronson begins the book by citing a number of scenarios, real and constructed -- reactions to the Kent State shootings, the Stanford prison experiments, and a four-year-old boy given a drum set among them -- that illustrate a variety of human behaviors seen in real life. The rest of the book is spent primarily on explaining how human minds operate and interact with each other, using these situations as examples. The book covering topics include the causes of prejudice, aggression, and cognitive dissonance. In explaining the reasons why people behave in unusual ways, Aronson cites his \\"first law\\": > People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy. Style and use of experimental method As a scientist, Aronson leans on the importance of case work and experimental study. Thus, the Social Animal's explanations of human behavior are largely validated with citations of studies done by researchers of social psychology.

Life and work Fabiana Bravo was born in Guaymall√©n Department, outside Mendoza, Argentina, to a family of modest means. She moved to Buenos Aires at age 22, and actively sought parts in the city's vibrant theatre scene. She appeared in Jos√© Cibri√°n's Dr√°cula, and Peter MacFarlane's Broadway Follies and Broadway II, among other productions. It was a personally tailored full scholarship program at The Catholic University of America that brought Fabiana Bravo from Argentina to Washington DC. From there she also studied interpretation at the Renata Scotto Institute in Savona, Italy, and Verdian repertoire at the Verdi Opera Studio in Parma, Italy. Finally, she accepted a one-year scholarship program to study in Voghera, Italy, at the Academy of Vocal Arts. Her talent was noticed by singer Valeria Lynch, who hired Bravo and who, in 1995 introduced her to Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Pavarotti included Bravo in an operatic talent contest, which she won, and which led to her role with Pavarotti as Lucia di Lammermoor at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Fabiana Bravo met with and performed for the United States Supreme Court in 1999, and has brought recognition of her hometown of Mendoza, through a series of very popular South American Recitals. She was added to the Metropolitan Opera Roster in the 2001/2002 season, and continues to perform in New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Chicago with regularity. She would go on to portray Tosca, Countess Almaviva, Leonora, Giorgetta, and Madama Butterfly in some of the world‚Äôs most renowned houses. In 1999, she was named Argentina's Woman of the Year for her remarkable contributions to the arts. She has also received numerous awards such as a Pl√°cido Domingo Operalia Finalist, Opera Index winner and Met Council Winner of the Regional Finalist Competition. In recent years, Bravo has sung the Countess Almaviva in The Marriage of Figaro (1997), Mimi in La boh√®me (1998), Donna Anna in Don Giovanni (1999) and the title role in Ariadne auf Naxos (2002), all in opera productions of Washington D.C's Summer Opera Theatre Company. She also sings with Virginia Opera, where her performance of Donna Anna brought her recognition as a much sought-after artist. She is now a renowned name in the international opera world, and performs in concert and opera throughout the world. Ms. Bravo currently resides in Washington, DC and Mendoza, Argentina.

Early life Tunku Muhriz is the only son out of six children of the late Tuanku Munawir ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan from 1960 to 1967, and of his consort, Tunku Ampuan Durah binti Almarhum Tunku Besar Burhanuddin. Born in 1948, Tunku Muhriz received his early education at the Tuanku Muhammad and Tunku Besar Schools in Tampin, the King George V School in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan and later at the Aldenham School in the United Kingdom. Tunku Muhriz obtained a degree in law (LLB) from the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (later known as the University of Wales, Aberystwyth). He began his career in an international bank in Malaysia and became a director and shareholder of a company licensed as brokers in interbank foreign exchange and in the currency deposits market(1973‚Äì1986). He was the chairman and shareholder of a Malaysian joint venture with a worldwide advertising agency (1981‚Äì1992), chairman and director of a joint venture company involved in the manufacturing of building products(1995‚Äì1998) and a director and shareholder of a company engaged in electrical engineering and construction (1995 to present). He has been on the board of directors of Bangkok Bank since 2006. Tunku Besar Tuanku Muhriz was made Tunku Besar, or heir presumptive in 1960. However, he was bypassed by the Council of Undangs to become Yang di-Pertuan Besar when his father died in 1967 for his uncle, Tuanku Jaafar. Tuanku Jaafar was elected by the Undangs as the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan. The Negeri Sembilan Constitution states that the order of succession should first be the sons of the previous Ruler, followed by the grandsons of the previous Ruler, then by the brothers of the previous Ruler, and only then by the sons of the brothers of the previous Ruler. Tuanku Muhriz was first in the order of succession before the death of Tuanku Munawir, followed by Tunku Jaafar and Tunku Abdullah. When Tuanku Munawir died, Tuanku Muhriz was not chosen. Instead the council chose his half-uncle Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, a diplomat. It has been suggested that the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, influenced the Undangs not to choose Tuanku Muhriz on account of his youth (he was then only nineteen). Yang di-Pertuan Besar On 29 December 2008, The Council of Undang proclaimed him as the 11th Yang di- Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan succeeding Almarhum Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman who had died on 27 December 2008. It has been learnt that many prominent Malaysians had backed Tuanku Muhriz to succeed as the Ruler of Negeri Sembilan in view of his modest and dignified personality and by his having a successful corporate career. He was also the rightful heir, by tradition, to the throne on the death of his father. Due to a lifelong habit of keeping a low profile, Tuanku Muhriz was largely unknown outside royal circles in Negeri Sembilan. However, Tuanku Muhriz was hardly the underdog in the intense negotiations that was played out for the position of Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negri Sembilan. During the closed discussions to elect the successor to the late Tuanku Jaafar, at least two, if not all four of the Undangs strongly championed his candidacy. They refused to budge when it was suggested that they consider Tunku Naquiyuddin, Tuanku Jaafar's eldest son, instead as the next Ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Tuanku Muhriz has throughout his life established and maintained strong ties with the Undangs, the general nobility, the lesser royalty and people of Negeri Sembilan, and more so since moving back to the state a few years ago. He also has powerful backers within the political establishment in the state, with the then serving Menteri Besar Tan Mohd Isa Abdul Samad among his supporters. There has been a quiet campaign by his loyal supporters at state and federal level to portray him as a well-spoken and well-educated man; someone who had the great strength of character to put aside the disappointment of not being appointed Ruler of the state in 1967: and who continues to lead a dignified and respectable life. His supporters said that in contrast to members of Tuanku Jaafar's family, Tuanku Muhriz shuns publicity and though he can be very progressive in his outlook, he seems more rooted in traditional ways. Tuanku Jaafar's family are said to be completely devastated with the decision of the Undangs to select Tuanku Muhriz over Tunku Naquiyuddin. They too had several powerful politicians in their camp but the Undangs were not to be swayed. Personal life Tunku Muhriz is married to Terengganu princess Tuanku Aishah Rohani and the royal couple have three sons: Tunku Ali Redhauddin, Tunku Zain Al-'Abidin and Tunku Alif Hussein.

As the first famous pioneer among black filmmakers, he was the first African American to produce and direct major motion pictures‚Äîdeveloping films relating the experience of slaves and struggling black Americans, and creating the \\"blaxploitation\\" genre. He is best remembered for his iconic photos of poor Americans during the 1940s (taken for a federal government project), for his photographic essays for Life magazine, and as the director of the 1971 film Shaft.

He was the youngest of fifteen children. His father was a farmer who grew corn, beets, turnips, potatoes, collard greens, and tomatoes. They also had a few ducks, chickens, and hogs.Parks,1990, p. 6. He attended a segregated elementary school. The town was too small to afford a separate high school that would facilitate segregation of the secondary school, but black people were not allowed to play sports or attend school social activities,Parks, 1990, pp. 1‚Äì2. and they were discouraged from developing any aspirations for higher education. Parks related in a documentary on his life that his teacher told him that his desire to go to college would be a waste of money. When Parks was eleven years old, three white boys threw him into the Marmaton River, knowing he couldn't swim. He had the presence of mind to duck underwater so they wouldn't see him make it to land.Parks, 1990, p. 16. His mother died when he was fourteen. He spent his last night at the family home sleeping beside his mother's coffin, seeking not only solace, but a way to face his own fear of death.Parks, 1990, pp. 12‚Äì13. Soon after, he was sent to St. Paul, Minnesota, to live with a sister and her husband. He and his brother-in-law argued frequently and Parks was finally turned out onto the street to fend for himself at age 15. Struggling to survive, he worked in brothels, and as a singer, piano player, bus boy, traveling waiter, and semi-pro basketball player.D'Ooge, Craig, \\"Photographer Gordon Parks Donates Archives to the Library of Congress\\", press release PR 95-096, 7/5/95, ISSN 0731-3527, Library of Congress, June 30, 1995.

There he not only observed the trappings of success, but was able to read many books from the club library.Parks,1990, pp. 26‚Äì27. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to the club, he jumped a train to Chicago,Parks, 1990, pp. 30‚Äì34. where he managed to land a job in a flophouse.Parks, 1990, p. 35. Career =Photography= At the age of 25, Parks was struck by photographs of migrant workers in a magazine. He bought his first camera, a Voigtl√§nder Brillant, for $7.50 at a Seattle, Washington, pawnshopGordon Park, bio Gale Group. and taught himself how to take photos. The photography clerks who developed Parks's first roll of film applauded his work and prompted him to seek a fashion assignment at a women's clothing store in St. Paul, Minnesota, owned by Frank Murphy. Those photographs caught the eye of Marva Louis, wife of heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis. She encouraged Parks and his wife, Sally Alvis, to move to Chicago in 1940,Parks, 1990, p. 77. where he began a portrait business and specialized in photographs of society women. Parks's photographic work in Chicago, especially in capturing the myriad experiences of African Americans across the city, led him to receive the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, in 1941, paying him $200 a month and offering him his choice of employer, which, in turn, contributed to being asked to join the Farm Security Administration, which was chronicling the nation's social conditions, under the auspice of Roy Stryker.Moskowitz, \\"Gordon Parks: A Man for All Seasons,\\" The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, 2003. Government photography Over the next few years, Parks moved from job to job, developing a freelance portrait and fashion photographer sideline. He began to chronicle the city's South Side black ghetto and, in 1941, an exhibition of those photographs won Parks a photography fellowship with the Farm Security Administration (FSA). American Gothic, Washington, D.C. ‚Äì a well-known photograph by Parks Working at the FSA as a trainee under Roy Stryker, Parks created one of his best-known photographs, American Gothic, Washington, D.C.,Yvonne Shinhoster Lamb, \\"'Life' Photographer And 'Shaft' Director Broke Color Barriers\\", The Washington Post, March 8, 2006. named after the iconic Grant Wood painting, American Gothic‚Äîa legendary painting of a traditional, stoic, white American farm couple‚Äîwhich bore a striking, but ironic, resemblance to Parks' photograph of a black menial laborer. Parks' \\"haunting\\" photograph shows a black woman, Ella Watson, who worked on the cleaning crew of the FSA building, standing stiffly in front of an American flag hanging on the wall, a broom in one hand and a mop in the background. Parks had been inspired to create the image after encountering racism repeatedly in restaurants and shops in the segregated capital city.Natanson, Nicholas, \\"From Sophie's Alley to the White House: Rediscovering the Visions of Pioneering Black Government Photographers,\\" from Prologue Magazine,\\" Special Issue: \\"Federal Records and African American History, Summer 1997, Vol. 29, No. 2, National Archives website. Retrieved January 2, 2016. A later photograph in the FSA series, by Parks, shows Ella Watson and her family Upon viewing the photograph, Stryker said that it was an indictment of America, and that it could get all of his photographers fired. He urged Parks to keep working with Watson, which led to a series of photographs of her daily life. Parks said later that his first image was overdone and not subtle; other commentators have argued that it drew strength from its polemical nature and its duality of victim and survivor, and thus affected far more people than his subsequent pictures of Mrs. Watson. (Parks' overall body of work for the federal government‚Äîusing his camera \\"as a weapon\\"‚Äîwould draw far more attention from contemporaries and historians than that of all other black photographers in federal service at the time. Today, most historians reviewing federally commissioned black photographers of that era focus almost exclusively on Parks.) After the FSA disbanded, Parks remained in Washington, D.C. as a correspondent with the Office of War Information,D'Ooge, Craig, \\"Media Advisory: Photographer Gordon Parks To Donate Personal Collection to the Library of Congress\\", press release PR 95-095, ISSN 0731-3527, Library of Congress, June 30, 1995.

He would later follow Stryker to the Standard Oil Photography Project in New Jersey, which assigned photographers to take pictures of small towns and industrial centers. The most striking work by Parks during that period included, Dinner Time at Mr. Hercules Brown's Home, Somerville, Maine (1944); Grease Plant Worker, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1946); Car Loaded with Furniture on Highway (1945); Self Portrait (1945); and Ferry Commuters, Staten Island, N.Y. (1946). Commercial and civic photography Parks renewed his search for photography jobs in the fashion world. Following his resignation from the Office of War Information, Parks moved to Harlem and became a freelance fashion photographer for Vogue under the editorship of Alexander Liberman. Despite racist attitudes of the day, Vogue editor, Liberman, hired him to shoot a collection of evening gowns. Parks photographed fashion for Vogue for the next few years and he developed the distinctive style of photographing his models in motion rather than in static poses. During this time, he published his first two books, Flash Photography (1947) and Camera Portraits: Techniques and Principles of Documentary Portraiture (1948). A 1948 photographic essay on a young Harlem gang leader won Parks a staff job as a photographer and writer with America's leading photo-magazine, Life. His involvement with Life would last until 1972. For over 20 years, Parks produced photographs on subjects including fashion, sports, Broadway, poverty, and racial segregation, as well as portraits of Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, Muhammad Ali, and Barbra Streisand. He became \\"one of the most provocative and celebrated photojournalists in the United States.\\" His photographs for Life magazine, namely his 1956 photo essay, titled \\"The Restraints: Open and Hidden,\\"\\"CDS Exhibit Features Gordon Parks‚Äôs Segregation Series, 'The Restraints: Open and Hidden'\\", CDs Porch. illuminated the effects of racial segregation while simultaneously following the everyday lives and activities of three families in and near Mobile, Alabama: the Thorntons, Causeys, and Tanners. As curators at the High Museum of Art Atlanta note, while Parks‚Äô photo essay served as decisive documentation of the Jim Crow South and all of its effects, he did not simply focus on demonstrations, boycotts, and brutality that were associated with that period instead, however, he \\"emphasized the prosaic details\\" of the lives of several families.Stange, Bare witness: Photographs by Gordon Parks, 2006High Museum of Art Atlanta, https://www.high.org/Art/Exhibitions/Gordon-Parks-Segregation- Story.aspx An exhibition of photographs from a 1950 project Parks completed for Life was exhibited in 2015 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.Kennedy, Randy, \\"‚ÄòA Long Hungry Look‚Äô: Forgotten Gordon Parks Photos Document Segregation\\", The New York Times, December 24, 2014 (with 11 images in a slide show); also published in print on December 28, 2014, p. AR1, the New York edition, with the headline \\"A Long Hungry Look\\". Parks returned to his hometown, Fort Scott, Kansas, where segregation persisted, and he documented conditions in the community and the contemporary lives of many of his eleven classmates from the segregated middle school they attended. The project included his commentary, but the work was never published by Life. During his years with Life, Parks also wrote a few books on the subject of photography (particularly documentary photography), and in 1960 was named Photographer of the Year by the American Society of Magazine Photographers. =Film= In the 1950s, Parks worked as a consultant on various Hollywood productions. He later directed a series of documentaries on black ghetto life that were commissioned by National Educational Television. With his film adaptation of his semi- autobiographical novel, The Learning Tree in 1969 for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, Parks became Hollywood's first major black director. It was filmed in his home town of Fort Scott, Kansas.Parks, 1990, p. 278. Parks also wrote the screenplay and composed the musical score for the film, with assistance from his friend, the composer Henry Brant. Shaft, a 1971 detective film directed by Parks and starring Richard Roundtree as John Shaft, became a major hit that spawned a series of films that would be labeled as blaxploitation. The blaxploitation genre was one in which images of lower-class blacks being involved with drugs, violence and women, were exploited for commercially successful films featuring black actors, and was popular with a section of the black community. Parks' feel for settings was confirmed by Shaft, with its portrayal of the super-cool leather-clad, black private detective hired to find the kidnapped daughter of a Harlem racketeer. Parks also directed the 1972 sequel, Shaft's Big Score, in which the protagonist finds himself caught in the middle of rival gangs of racketeers. Parks's other directorial credits include The Super Cops (1974) and Leadbelly (1976), a biographical film of the blues musician Huddie Ledbetter. In the 1980s, he made several films for television and composed the music and a libretto for Martin, a ballet tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., which premiered in Washington, D.C. during 1989. It was screened on national television on King's birthday in 1990. In 2000, as an homage, he had a cameo appearance in the Shaft sequel that starred Samuel L. Jackson in the title role as the namesake and nephew of the original John Shaft. In the cameo scene, Parks was sitting playing chess when Jackson greeted him as, \\"Mr. P.\\" =Musician and composer= His first job was as a piano player in a brothel when he was a teenager.Parks, 1990, pp. 19‚Äì20. Parks also performed as a jazz pianist. His song \\"No Love\\", composed in another brothel, was performed during a national radio broadcast by Larry Funk and his orchestra in the early 1930s.Parks, 1990, p. 45. Parks composed Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1953) at the encouragement of black American conductor, Dean Dixon, and his wife Vivian, a pianist,Parks, 1990, p. 150. and with the help of the composer Henry Brant.Parks, 1990, p. 153. He completed Tree Symphony in 1967. In 1989, he composed and directed Martin, a ballet dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights leader who had been assassinated. =Writing= Starting in the late-1940s, Parks began writing‚Äîa second career that would produce 15 books and lead to his role as a prominent black filmmaker‚Äîstarting with books on the art and craft of photography. Beginning in the 1960s, Parks branched out into literature, writing The Learning Tree (1963). He authored several books of poetry, which he illustrated with his own photographs, and he wrote three volumes of memoirs--A Choice of Weapons (1966), Voices in the Mirror (1990), and A Hungry Heart (2005). In 1981, Parks turned to fiction with Shannon, a novel about Irish immigrants fighting their way up the social ladder in turbulent early 20th-century New York. Parks' writing accomplishments include novels, poetry, autobiography, and non-fiction that includes photographic instructional manuals and film-making books. During this period, Parks also wrote the poem \\"The Funeral\\". =Painting= Parks' photography-related abstract oil paintings were showcased in a 1981 exhibition at Alex Rosenberg Gallery in New York titled \\"Gordon Parks: Expansions: The Aesthetic Blend of Painting and Photography.\\" =Essence magazine= Parks was a co-founder of Essence magazine and served as its editorial director during the first three years of its circulation. Personal life Parks in 2000 Parks was married and divorced three times. He married Sally Alvis in Minneapolis during 1933Parks, 1990, p. 61. and they divorced in 1961. In 1962, he married Elizabeth Campbell, daughter of cartoonist E. Simms Campbell, and they divorced in 1973.Sheena C. Howard, Encyclopedia of Black Comics, Golden: Fulcrum Publishing, 2017, p. 47. Parks first met Chinese-American editor Genevieve Young (stepdaughter of Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo) in 1962 when he began writing The Learning Tree.Parks, 1990, p. 207. At that time, his publisher assigned her to be his editor. They became romantically involved at a time when they both were divorcing previous spouses, and married in 1973. They divorced in 1979. Candace Bushnell claims to have dated Parks in 1976, when she was 18 and he was 58. For many years, Parks was romantically involved with Gloria Vanderbilt, the railroad heiress and designer. Their relationship evolved into a deep friendship that endured throughout his lifetime. Parks had four children: Gordon, Jr., David, Leslie, and Toni (Parks-Parsons). His oldest son Gordon Parks, Jr., whose talents resembled his father's, was killed in a plane crash in 1979 in Kenya, where he had gone to direct a film.\\"Filmmaker Gordon Parks; victim of airplane crash\\", The Day, April 3, 1979.Parks, 1990, p. 335. Parks has five grandchildren: Alain, Gordon III, Sarah, Campbell, and Satchel. Malcolm X honored Parks when he asked him to be the godfather of his daughter, Qubilah Shabazz. He died of cancer at the age of 93 while living in Manhattan, New York City, and is buried in his hometown of Fort Scott, Kansas.  Legacy  = In film = With his film Shaft (along with Melvin Van Peebles's Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, released earlier the same year), Parks is credited with co-creating the genre of blaxploitation, an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s. The action film also helped to alter Hollywood's view of African Americans, introducing the black action hero into mainstream cinema.

The word \\"Elgygytgyn\\" means \\"white lake\\" in the Chukchi language. The lake is of particular interest to scientists because it has never been covered by glaciers. This has allowed the uninterrupted build-up of of sediment at the bottom of the lake, recording information on prehistoric climate change. Geography Landsat 7 satellite image of the lake Lake El'gygytgyn is located in the Anadyr Plateau, part of the Anadyr Highlands. It is drained to the southeast by the Enmyvaam, a tributary of the Belaya. It is approximately in diameter and has a maximum depth of . The lake is centered within an impact crater with a rim diameter of that formed 3.6 million years ago during the Pliocene. Before it was reliably dated, preliminary papers in the late 1970s suggested either ElgygytgynR.S.

Glass (1979), Zhamanshin crater, a possible source of Australasian tektites? Geology, July 1979, v. 7, p. 351-353 as the source of the young Australasian strewnfield.  Scientific drilling  In late 2008 and early 2009, an international team from the USA (Dr. Julie Brigham-Grette), Germany (Dr. Martin Melles), Russia (Dr. Pavel Sergeevich Minuyk) and Austria (Dr. Christian Koeberl) conducted a drilling program targeting three holes in El'gygytgyn Lake. The resulting cores are designated ICPD Site 5011-1 and 5011-3. This co-sponsored by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), with funding also provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) and GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ), the Russian Academy of Sciences Far East Branch (RAS FEB), the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research (BMWF). Fauna The conditions in the El'gygytgyn lake are extremely severe for fish life. Even so, there are three species permanently inhabiting the lake's harsh aquatic environment. Fly Fishing Russia ‚Äì The Elgygytgyn Lake, Chukotka These are three types of char: Salvelinus boganidae, S. elgyticus (Small-mouth char) and Salvethymus svetovidovi (long-finned char).Salvethymus svetovidovi The two latter species are endemic to the El'gygytgyn lake. The golets (Salvelinus alpinus, ) has been introduced recently. Fish species in the lake are adapted to its very cold waters, which are generally just above the freezing point, and spend most of the year in total darkness. The surface is frozen for about 10 months of the year. It may start to melt in the summer, but some years it never fully thaws.Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in the lake See also *List of lakes of Russia References External links * Dr. Matt Nolan at the University of Alaska Fairbanks * Polar Expedition to Siberian Lake will Yield Details of Past Climate PhysOrg.com. * NASA Earth Observatory * Haltia E.

She flew on five Space Shuttle missions between 1985 and 1998, including two dockings with the Mir space station. Since leaving NASA, she has worked in museums and STEM leadership as well as a professor of aerospace engineering. Early life Dunbar was born in Sunnyside, Washington. She graduated from Sunnyside High School in 1967. She attended the University of Washington and received her undergraduate degree in ceramic engineering in 1971. After college, she worked for Boeing Computer Services for two years as a systems analyst. From 1973 to 1975, Dunbar conducted research for her master's thesis at the University of Washington in the field of mechanisms and kinetics of ionic diffusion in sodium beta-alumina. She is a member of Kappa Delta sorority. In 1975, Dunbar was invited to participate in research at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Oxfordshire, as a visiting scientist. Her work there involved the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates. Following her work in England, she accepted a senior research engineer position with Rockwell International Space Division in Downey, California. Her responsibilities there included developing equipment and processes for the manufacture of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system in Palmdale. She represented Rockwell International as a member of the Dr. Kraft Ehricke evaluation committee on prospective space industrialization concepts. Dunbar completed her doctorate at the University of Houston in 1983. Her multi- disciplinary dissertation (materials science and physiology) involved evaluating the effects of simulated space flight on bone strength and fracture toughness. These results were correlated to alterations in hormonal and metabolic activity. Dunbar is a private pilot with over 200 hours in single engine land aircraft. She has logged more than 700 hours flying time in T-38 jets as a back-seater, and has over 100 hours as co-pilot in a Cessna Citation jet. Dunbar was formerly married to fellow astronaut Ronald M. Sega. NASA career Dunbar became a payload officer/flight controller at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1978. She served as a guidance and navigation officer/flight controller for the Skylab reentry mission in 1979 and was subsequently designated project officer/payload officer for the integration of several Space Shuttle payloads. Dunbar became a NASA astronaut in August 1981. Her technical assignments included assisting in the verification of Shuttle flight software at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), serving as a member of the Flight Crew Equipment Control Board, participation as a member of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group, and supporting operational development of the remote manipulator system (RMS). She served as chief of the Mission Development Branch, as the Astronaut Office interface for \\"secondary\\" payloads, and as lead for the Science Support Group. In 1993, Dunbar served as Deputy Associate Administrator, Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In February 1994, she traveled to Star City, Russia, where she spent 13 months training as a back-up crew member for a three-month flight on Mir. In March 1995, she was certified by the Russian Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center as qualified to fly on long duration Mir flights. From October 1995 to November 1996, she was detailed to the NASA JSC Mission Operations Directorate as Assistant Director where she was responsible for chairing the International Space Station Training Readiness Reviews, and facilitating Russian/American operations and training strategies. Spaceflight experience A veteran of five space flights, Dunbar has logged more than 1,208 hours (50 days) in space. She served as a mission specialist on STS-61-A in 1985, STS-32 in 1990, and STS-71 in 1995, and was the Payload Commander on STS-50 in 1992, and STS-89 in 1998. STS-61-A Challenger (October 30-November 6, 1985), was the West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. During the flight, Dunbar was responsible for operating Spacelab and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Her mission training included six months of experiment training in Germany, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. STS-61-A launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 7 days, 44 minutes 51 seconds, traveling 2.5 million miles in 111 orbits of the Earth. STS-32 Columbia (January 9‚Äì20, 1990), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Base in California. During the flight, the crew successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also operated a variety of middeck experiments including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR), and the IMAX Camera. Dunbar was principal investigator for the MDE/FEA Experiment. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight lower body negative pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Mission duration was 10 days, 21 hours, 01 minute, 38 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 173 orbits of the Earth. STS-50 Columbia (June 25 to July 9, 1992). Dunbar was the Payload Commander on STS-50, the United States Microgravity Lab-1 mission which was dedicated to microgravity fluid physics and materials science. Over 30 experiments sponsored by over 100 investigators were housed in the Spacelab in the Shuttle's Payload Bay. A payload crew of four operated around-the-clock for 13 days performing experiments in scientific disciplines such as protein crystal growth, electronic and infrared detector crystal growth, surface tension physics, zeolite crystal growth, and human physiology. Mission duration was 13 days, 19 hours, 30 minutes and 4 seconds, traveling 5.7 million miles in 221 orbits of the Earth. STS-71 Atlantis (June 27 to July 7, 1995), was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The Atlantis was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. Dunbar served as MS-3 on this flight which also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed medical evaluations on the returning Mir crew. These evaluations included ascertaining the effects of weightlessness on the cardio/vascular system, the bone/muscle system, the immune system, and the cardio/pulmonary system. Mission duration was 9 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds, traveling 4.1 million miles in 153 orbits of the earth. STS-89 Endeavour (January 22‚Äì31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle- Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle Endeavour to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth. Dunbar was the Payload Commander, responsible for all payload activities including the conduct of 23 technology and science experiments. Post-NASA career Dunbar retired from NASA in September 2005. She served as president and CEO of The Museum of Flight in Seattle until April 2010. From 2013 to 2015, Dunbar led the University of Houston's STEM Center and was a faculty member in the Cullen College of Engineering.

Dunbar"},{"id":"598405","text":"Potchefstroom (, colloquially Potch) is an academic city in the North West Province of South Africa. It hosts the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University. Potchefstroom is on the Mooi Rivier (Afrikaans for \\"pretty river\\"), roughly west-southwest of Johannesburg and east-northeast of Klerksdorp. Potchefstroom, together with Rustenburg, is the second-largest city in the North West Province. The largest city, Klerksdorp, is about away. Etymology Several theories exist about the origin of the city's name. According to one theory, it originates from Potgieter + Chef + stroom (referring to Voortrekker leader and town founder Andries Potgieter; \\"chef\\" indicates the leader of the Voortrekkers, and \\"stroom\\" refers to the Mooi River). Geoffrey Jenkins writes, \\"Others however, attribute the name as having come from the word 'Potscherf', meaning a shard of a broken pot, due to the cracks that appear in the soil of the Mooi River Valley during drought resembling a broken pot\\".Jenkins, 1971:8 M. L. Fick suggests that Potchefstroom developed from the abbreviation of \\"Potgieterstroom\\" to \\"Potgerstroom\\", which became \\"Potchefstroom\\". However, this does not account for the appearance of \\"Potjestroom\\" on many documents and photographs. The African National Congress decided to change the name of the municipality and some street names in 2006, favouring \\"Tlokwe\\" as the new name. In 2007, its name was changed from Potchefstroom Municipality to Tlokwe Municipality. However, the city continued to use the name Potchefstroom. The Tlowke Municipality merged with the Ventersdorp Municipality in 2016, forming the larger JB Marks Local Municipality. History Potchefstroom, founded in 1838 by the Voortrekkers, is the second-oldest European settlement in the Transvaal. The oldest European settlement is Klerksdorp, about west. Some historians challenge this, because the first settlement was in the \\"upper regions of the Schoon Spruit\\" (believed to have been between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom). However, Potchefstroom was the first to develop into a town. Until 1840, the towns of Potchefstroom and Winburg and their surrounding territories were a Boer Republic known as the Republic of Winburg- Potchefstroom. Voortrekker leader Andries Hendrik Potgieter was elected as chief commandant. In October 1840, after a meeting between Potgieter, Andries Pretorius and G. R. van Rooyen, it was decided that Potchefstroom would unite with \\"Pieter Mouriets Burg\\" (Pietermaritzburg). On 16‚Äì17 January 1852, the Sand River Convention was signed between Andries Pretorius (representing the Boers) and Major W. S. Hogge and C. M. Owen (representing Britain). According to the convention, the British government would allow the immigrant farmers north of the Vaal River to govern themselves with no interference from either side. This signalled the establishment of the Zuid-Afrikaanse Republiek (ZAR) (South African Republic). In Article 17 of the Constitution of the ZAR dated 18 February 1858 (which was accepted in Rustenburg), it was stated that \\"Potchefstroom, located on the Mooi River, would be the capital of the Republic and that Pretoria would be the seat of government\\". In May 1860, Potchefstroom became the \\"chief city\\" of the republic and the capital moved to Pretoria. On 16 December 1880, the First Boer War began when the Boers laid siege to the old fort. The siege ended amicably on 23 March 1881. The British built concentration camps during the Second Boer War for Boer women, children, and elderly men, where more than 27,000 died of starvation and disease. At the opening of the city hall in 1909, colonial secretary Jan Smuts was asked about the possibility of Potchefstroom becoming capital of the Union. He replied that the city stood no chance, but should aim to be South Africa's largest educational centre.Jenkins, 1971:104 This has led to Potchefstroom's being the \\"city of expertise\\", with numerous tertiary educational institutions. It has hosted the annual late-September Aardklop Arts Festival, a predominantly- Afrikaans arts festival, since 1997. Population The Potchefstroom Municipality, which encompasses several neighbouring settlements, had a population of 128,357 in the 2007 community survey. Of these, 69.6 percent were black, 27.0 percent were white, three percent were coloureds and 0.4 percent were Asian. However, the city itself and surrounding suburbs have a population of 43,448, of which 69.9 percent are white, 25.4 percent are black, 2.8 percent were coloured and 1.3 percent were Asian. Ken McArthur of Potchefstroom won a gold medal at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the marathon. McArthur was known in his home village of North Antrim for his training routine, which consisted of racing a narrow-gauge train. Education Potchefstroom is home to five tertiary institutions, 30 other schools and a number of research bureaus and training centres, including: *The North-West University, a merged tertiary institution which was created on 1 January 2004, with campuses in Potchefstroom, Mafikeng and Vanderbijlpark. The Potchefstroom Campus (formerly the Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Ho√´r Onderwys, founded in 1869) is the largest, and the university's head office is located there. The North-West University became one of South Africa's larger universities after the merger, with about 32,000 full-time and distance- education students. * Pearson Institute of Higher Education, was founded in 1989 as a private, university-level, degree-conferring institution in South Africa. They have 12 campuses across South Africa. They focus on making their students employable and real-world ready. Each course is designed to equip students with the tools they need to excel in the world of work. Take the next step and enrol in one of the more than 40 registered tertiary programmes. *The Potchefstroom College of Education (originally the Normal College), which was founded in 1919. The college was originally housed in galvanised-iron buildings on the same premises as the Potchefstroom High School for Boys, and moved to its present location in 1923. The College of Education was incorporated by the university on 1 January 2001. *The Technical College Potchefstroom, founded in 1939 when the Union Education Department began \\"continuation classes\\". *The Agricultural Centre, previously known as the Experimental Farm (1902) and Agricultural College (1939), is the largest agricultural facility in one location in southern Africa. The centre houses the headquarters of the Highveld Region of the Department of Agriculture, the Grain Crops Institute, and the Agricultural College. The Potchefstroom Koekoek chicken was developed there. * CTU Training Solutions Potchefstroom Campus is a FET college in Potchefstroom since 2006, specializing in IT, Business and Design training - full time, part-time or any corporate training. *Potchefstroom Akademie, founded in 1981 by Tina Sch√∂ltz, offers tertiary education in somatology, health and skincare therapy, holistic health therapies and interior design and decorating. *Potchefstroom High School for Girls: Originally known as the Central School, it was established in 1874. Girls High was founded in 1905, when the Central School was divided into separate high schools for boys and girls. *Potchefstroom High School for Boys, established in 1874, has been at its current site since 1905. *Potchefstroom Gimnasium, founded in January 1907 as Die Voorbereidende Skool, was a preparatory school for theological studies and part of the Potchefstroom University before moving to its current location. On 25 January 1915, it changed its name to Goeverement Skool. A year later it was the first school to use Afrikaans in addition to Dutch and English, and first Afrikaans high school north of the Vaal River. In 1918, it became a high school and changed its name to Potchefstroom Gimnasium. *Potchefstroom Central Primary School, the city's only English-speaking primary school *Ho√´r Volkskool Potchefstroom, founded in 1927 *The Hair Academy of South Africa (THASA), founded in 2008, is registered with the Department of Higher Education and Training and provides national and international hairdressing qualifications. Public primary and high schools in Potchefstroom's townships include Boitirelo Primary School, Lesego Primary School, Boitshoko High School and Tlokwe High School. Sports facilities Potchefstroom, known as the North West Province's \\"Home of Sport\\", is the provincial headquarters of 17 major sports. The city council emphasises the establishment, maintenance and upgrading of its sports facilities, particularly to meet the sporting and recreational needs of its younth. The Mooi River and other trails add colour and variety to facilities available to residents and tourists. Potchefstroom has hosted two World Cup- winning teams (in cricket and football), and is a home away from home for international athletes and teams. At altitude, it provides a good balance between altitude and quality training. The city has no large factories, and good air quality. Athletes and professional teams train at the North-West University's High Performance Institute of Sport. Cricket is popular, with Senwes Park the home ground of the Highveld Lions. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Potchefstroom hosted matches between Australia and the Netherlands, Australia and Namibia, and South Africa and Kenya. Potchefstroom co-hosted the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The South Africa national cricket team has regularly chosen Potchefstroom for off-season training and has hosted the Australian team's off-season cricket camps. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Australia's cricket team chose Potchefstroom as their home base and won the tournament. Rugby is arguably Potchefstroom's most popular sport. Ol√´n Park, the main rugby stadium, is primarily used for rugby union matches by the Leopards in the Vodacom Cup and the first division of the Currie Cup. The stadium is also used for football matches, and has hosted the South Africa under-23 team. Jomo Cosmos, a Premier Soccer League, team relegated to the National First Division, also uses the stadium for some matches. Profert Ol√´n Park was named after Carl Ludwig Theodor Ol√´n, president of the Western Transvaal Rugby Union between 1922 and 1934. Profert, a local fertiliser company, maintains the playing field. The Absa Puk Oval is on the North-West University campus. The university sport grounds is known as the Fanie du Toit Sports Complex. The main rugby field has hosted several Leopards games and the Potchefstroom Campus' Varsity Cup matches. PUC McArthur Stadium, the athletics stadium, was renovated for the fourth time in 2014. Built in 1892, it was named in honour of 1912 Olympic marathon gold medalist Ken McArthur. Noted local athletes include Godfrey Khotso Mokoena, the silver medalist in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, Hezeki√©l Sepeng, Jorrie Muller, Justine Robbeson and Ryan Diedericks. The visit of the Spain national football team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup brought a new level of sport to Potchefstroom and the NWU. Spain, who won their inaugural FIFA World Cup title, chose Potchefstroom as their base camp. A new sports complex was built at the North-West University for the team, and the local airport was expanded to accommodate large passenger planes. Politics Mayor Maphetle Maphetle of the African National Congress was dismissed in late 2012 after a motion of no confidence passed, and Annette Combrink of the opposition Democratic Alliance was elected mayor. Three months later a motion of no confidence removed Combrink, and Maphetle was reinstated. Since then, municipal-council and mayoral elections have been keenly contested.

Although 18 episodes were planned, only 13 were produced. The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a cult following, thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on Teletoon's Teletoon Unleashed block; Cartoon Network's popular late-night programming block Adult Swim; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late-night programming block on TBS. Mission Hill was formerly known as The Downtowners, although MTV's production of the similarly titled Downtown forced a name change. It has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Spain and New Zealand. Stylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, neon color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \\"cartoonish\\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's Hanna-Barbera cartoons. The designs were done by Lauren MacMullan, who cites the comic series Eightball as her source of inspiration for her overall design. The series was created in 1997https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill- oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former executive producers of The Simpsons, and the artistic designer was Lauren MacMullan. It features the voices of Wallace Langham, Scott Menville, Brian Posehn, Vicki Lewis, Nick Jameson, Tom Kenny, Herbert Sig√ºenza, Jane Wiedlin, Tress MacNeille and Lisa Kushell. The theme song is a faster, instrumental version of \\"Italian Leather Sofa\\" by Cake. Warner Home Video released all 13 completed episodes on DVD, on November 29, 2005. On June 30, 2020, Bill Oakley announced plans for a spinoff tentatively titled Gus and Wally, which will be set six months after the series' conclusion and will focus on the elderly gay couple who were supporting characters in Mission Hill. Premise Set in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft. Characters =Main= * Andrew \\"Andy\\" French (Wallace Langham) ‚Äì A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \\"post- college slump year.\\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \\"Unemployment, Part 1,\\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \\"Unemployment, Part 2\\" to \\"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\\" (and including the unproduced episodes \\"Supertool\\" and \\"Pretty in Pink\\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \\"douchebag\\". * Kevin French (Scott Menville) ‚Äì Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for Wyoming, bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill. He hopes to attend Yale University, and prides himself on his SAT scores. He has a habit of \\"bling- blonging,\\" saying \\"bling blong\\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters. * James \\"Jim\\" Kuback (Brian Posehn) ‚Äì In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \\"Okay.\\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to Generation Y. * Posey Tyler (Vicki Lewis) ‚Äì In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone. * Stogie ‚Äì Andy's pet Golden Retriever, who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \\"there are dark forces at work within him\\", in the first episode. =Supporting= * Gus Duncz (Nick Jameson) ‚Äì A gay man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally. According to audio commentary by the producers, Gus is based on Broderick Crawford, though according to the audio commentary for The Simpsons seventh season episode, \\"Marge Be Not Proud,\\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was Lawrence Tierney (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting). * Wally Langford (Tom Kenny) ‚Äì A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a projectionist at the local art movie house. He is based on David Niven. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \\"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled The Man from Pluto (which parodied Plan 9 from Outer Space). It starred his partner Gus in the title role. * Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez (Vicki Lewis) ‚Äì Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \\"Baby Nameless\\" and her non-working \\"marital partner\\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator Lois M. Leveen, a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \\"Lois-y\\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 * Carlos Hernandez (Herbert Sig√ºenza) ‚Äì Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and stay-at- home dad for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a Christian, his work is, at times, reminiscent of Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera and Bob Ross. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab. * Gwen (Jane Wiedlin) ‚Äì Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's Waterbed World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes The Go-Go's. * Toby Mundorf (Josh Weinstein) ‚Äì In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward. * George Bang (Bill Oakley) ‚Äì Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing video games. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent. * Ron (Nick Jameson) ‚Äì A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the Soviet Union, which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). On \\"Unemployment, Part 1,\\" Ron was arrested for tax evasion and his store was confiscated by the government. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees. Production Episodes Thirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. Animatics for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series' cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics‚Äîincluding a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode \\"Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)\\"‚Äîhave been released through various internet outlets. =Season 1 (1999‚Äì2002)= =Unfinished episodes= Location The series takes place in a district called Mission Hill. Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called Cosmopolis. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban metropolis similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of Mission Hill in Boston (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, Silver Lake in Los Angeles, Wicker Park in Chicago, and Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of East and West Coast cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart. Home release DVD cover Warner Home Video released all 13 completed episodes on DVD on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \\"Everybody Hurts\\" by R.E.M. in the episode \\"Andy Vs. The Real World\\". The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \\"Gordon Lightfoot\\" to \\"Scott Joplin\\" in the episode \\"Unemployment Part 1\\". Awards Mission Hill received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \\"Best Series for All Audiences\\"; the award cited the series' \\"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\\" The series won an award from GLAAD for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.

He occupied the command module pilot seat during the flight of Apollo 7 in 1968. After retiring from both NASA and the Air Force, he became the Peace Corps country director for Thailand, before moving into private business. Biography =Early life and education= Eisele was born June 23, 1930, in Columbus, Ohio, and graduated from West High School in 1948. He was an –ïagle Scout. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1952, and chose a commission in the United States Air Force. He received a Master of Science degree in Astronautics from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, in 1960. =Flight experience= Eisele attended and graduated from the Aerospace Research Pilot School (Class 62A) at Edwards Air Force Base, California in 1962; his classmates included Charles Bassett and Theodore Freeman. Eisele was a project engineer and experimental test pilot at the Air Force Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. He flew experimental test flights in support of special weapons development programs. He logged more than 4,200 hours flying time, 3,600 of which were in jet aircraft. =NASA career= Eisele prior to launching of Apollo 7. The Apollo 7 crew: Eisele (l.), Wally Schirra (c.), and Walter Cunningham (r.). Barbara Eden, Bob Hope, the Apollo 7 astronauts, and Paul Haney (voice of Mission Control) on The Bob Hope Show (November 6, 1968). Eisele was part of NASA's third group of astronauts, selected in October 1963. In early 1966, Eisele was quietly selected as Pilot for the Apollo 1 crew, along with Command Pilot Virgil I. \\"Gus\\" Grissom and Senior Pilot Ed White. But after dislocating his shoulder twice during training in January 1966, Eisele was replaced by Roger B. Chaffee. After corrective surgery on January 27, Eisele was named to the crew for the second crewed Apollo flight, with Command Pilot Walter \\"Wally\\" Schirra and Pilot Walter Cunningham. At this time, Eisele was promoted to the Senior Pilot position. In December 1966, Apollo 2 was cancelled on the grounds that it would be an unnecessary repeat of Apollo 1, and Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham became the backups to Grissom's crew. But after Grissom, White, and Chaffee were killed in the Apollo 1 spacecraft fire of January 27, 1967, Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were named to fly the first crewed Apollo mission instead. It would ultimately be called Apollo 7. As the launch date approached, Eisele's participation was at risk; he was having an extramarital affair with a woman who would later become his second wife. Astronaut Office Chief Deke Slayton had warned the crew that they were all \\"expendable\\", and that any extramarital affairs must not become public. Eisele remained on the crew, and on October 11, 1968, Apollo 7 was launched on an 11-day mission‚Äîthe first crewed flight test of the third generation United States spacecraft. By this time, the Senior Pilot title was changed to Command Module Pilot. Together with spacecraft commander Schirra and Lunar Module Pilot Cunningham, Eisele performed simulated transposition and docking maneuvers with the upper stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle, and acted as navigator, taking star sightings and aligning the spacecraft's guidance and navigation platform. The crew completed eight successful test firing maneuvers of the service module's propulsion engine. They also tested the performance of all spacecraft systems and broadcast the first live televised coverage of crew activities. Apollo 7 was placed in an Earth-orbit with an apogee of and perigee of . The 260-hour, 4.5 million mile (7.25 Gm; 7.25 million km) shakedown flight was successfully concluded on October 22, 1968, with splashdown occurring in the Atlantic, 8 miles (15 km) from the carrier USS Essex and only from the predicted target. Eisele logged 260 hours in space. Eisele served as backup Command Module Pilot for the 1969 Apollo 10 flight. Eisele resigned from the Astronaut Office in 1970 and became technical assistant for manned spaceflight at the NASA Langley Research Center, a position he occupied until retiring from both NASA and the Air Force in 1972. =Post-NASA career= In July 1972, Eisele became Country Director of the U.S. Peace Corps in Thailand. Returning from Thailand two years later, he became Sales Manager for Marion Power Shovel, a division of Dresser Industries. Eisele then handled private and corporate accounts for the investment firm of Oppenheimer & Company. In 1980, Eisele moved to Wilton Manors, Florida. In 1981, Eisele was appointed to a vacant seat on the Wilton Manors City Commission, and served in that political office for roughly one year. After Eisele's death, the City of Wilton Manors named Donn Eisele Park in his memory. Eisele was a guide in the 1986 Concorde Comet Chase flights out of Miami and New York. =Death= In 1987, at the age of 57, Eisele died of a heart attack while on a business trip to Tokyo, Japan, where he was to attend the opening of a new Space Camp patterned on the one at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Eisele was cremated in Japan, and his ashes were buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Organizations Eisele was an Eagle Scout, a member of Tau Beta Pi, and a Freemason, belonging to Luther B. Turner Lodge # 732 in Columbus, Ohio. Awards and honors Among the honors he received during his career were the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the Air Force Senior Pilot Astronaut Wings, and the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross. He was a co-recipient of the AIAA 1969 Haley Astronautics Award and was presented the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award in 1969. Eisele was a part of a group of Apollo astronauts to be inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2008, NASA posthumously awarded Eisele the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Apollo 7 mission. Legacy A family-approved account of Donn Eisele's life appears in the 2007 book In the Shadow of the Moon. Eisele's posthumously discovered memoir Apollo Pilot was published by University of Nebraska Press in 2017. In the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, Eisele was portrayed by John Mese. In the final three episodes of the 2015 ABC television series The Astronaut Wives Club, Eisele was portrayed by Ryan Doom. Susan Eisele Black donated a sample of a Moon rock to Broward County Main Library on behalf of her late husband, on October 23, 2007. Broward County Library, located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is the only library in the United States to have a lunar rock on display. The precious Moon rock is typically exhibited at science museums and schools. See also *List of Eagle Scouts *The Astronaut Monument References External links *Astronautix biography of Donn F.

Eisele"},{"id":"598419","text":"The Stage is a British weekly newspaper and website covering the entertainment industry, and particularly theatre. It was founded in 1880. It contains news, reviews, opinion, features, and recruitment advertising, mainly directed at those who work in theatre and the performing arts. History The first edition of The Stage was published (under the title The Stage Directory ‚Äì a London and Provincial Theatrical Advertiser) on 1 February 1880 at a cost of three old pence for twelve pages. Publication was monthly until 25 March 1881, when the first weekly edition was produced. At the same time, the name was shortened to The Stage and the publication numbering restarted at number 1. The publication was a joint venture between founding editor Charles Lionel Carson and business manager Maurice Comerford. It operated from offices opposite the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Carson, whose real name was Lionel Courtier-Dutton, was cited as the founder. His wife Emily Courtier Dutton later founded several theatrical charities. The Stage entered a crowded market, with many other theatre titles (including The Era) in circulation. Undercutting their rivals, Carson and Comerford dropped the price of the paper to one penny; soon it became the only remaining title in the field. The newspaper has remained in family ownership. Upon the death in 1937 of Charles Carson's son Lionel, who had assumed the joint role of managing director and editor, control passed to the Comerford family. From 1995, the newspaper has awarded The Stage Awards for Acting Excellence at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In 2004, 96-year-old contributor Simon Blumenfeld was recognised by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest weekly newspaper columnist. The column continued until shortly before his death in 2005. The Stage Awards were launched in 2010. They are given annually and recognise outstanding organisations working in theatre and beyond in the following categories: London theatre, regional theatre, producer, school, fringe theatre, theatre building, unsung hero and international. In August 2013, The Stage launched The Stage Castings, an online casting service with a video audition function. In May 2019, The Stage partnered with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation and UK Theatre to launch Get Into Theatre, a website dedicated to theatre careers. Careers started via The Stage In 1956, writer John Osborne submitted his script for Look Back in Anger in response to an advertisement by the soon-to- be-relaunched Royal Court Theatre. Dusty Springfield responded to an advertisement for female singers in 1958. Idris Elba got his first acting role in a play after applying to a job ad in the paper. Harold Pinter gained his first job after responding to an advert and Kenneth Branagh landed the lead in The Billy Trilogy, in the BBC Play for Today series, after it was advertised in the paper. Ricky Tomlinson responded to an ad for United Kingdom, another Play for Today, in 1981 and Sandi Toksvig landed her first television job playing the part of Ethel in No. 73 after answering an ad in The Stage. Television presenter Maggie Philbin won her first major role, as a co- presenter of Multi-Coloured Swap Shop, after answering an advertisement in The Stage. A number of pop groups have recruited all or some of their members through advertisements placed in the newspaper, most notably the Spice Girls in 1994,The Spice Girls; Cripps, Rebecca; & Peachey, Mal (1997).

Selected in 1967, England was among a group of astronauts who served as backups during the Apollo and Skylab programs. Like most others in his class, he flew during the Space Shuttle program, serving as a mission specialist on STS-51F in 1985. He has logged more than 4,000 hours of flying time and 188 hours in space. England helped develop and use radars to probe the Moon on Apollo 17 and glaciers in Washington and Alaska. He participated in and led field parties during two seasons in Antarctica. England is currently dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan's Dearborn campus. Biography =Early years and education= England was born May 15, 1942, in Indianapolis, Indiana, but his hometown is West Fargo, North Dakota. He attended primary school in Indianapolis, Indiana, and graduated from high school in North Dakota. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) he received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Earth and planetary sciences (course 12A) in 1965, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Earth and planetary sciences in 1970. England was a graduate fellow at MIT for the three years immediately preceding his first assignment to NASA. =Career= England was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967, as part of the 6th astronaut selection. At 25 years 81 days old, he was the youngest candidate to be selected up to that time. He subsequently completed the initial academic training and a 53-week course in flight training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. He received his wings with distinguished honors in April 1969. England served as a support crewman for the Apollo 13 and 16 flights. He was also an EVA CapCom during the Apollo 16 mission, talking to the astronauts while they explored the surface of the moon. Notably, he developed and communicated instructions for construction of the lithium hydroxide canisters on Apollo 13. England and Philip Chapman resigned from NASA in 1972, citing a decline in crewed missions. Neither had flown in space at that point. England joined the U.S. Geological Survey. He was deputy chief of the Office of Geochemistry and Geophysics for the U.S. Geological Survey, and associate editor for the Journal of Geophysical Research. He served on the National Academy's Space Studies Board, and on several federal committees concerned with Antarctic policy, nuclear waste containment, and federal science and technology. England returned to the Johnson Space Center in 1979 as a senior scientist-astronaut (mission specialist), was assigned to the operation mission development group of the Astronaut Office, and eventually managed that group. Space shuttle flight STS-51-F, carrying a seven-man crew and Spacelab-2, was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on July 29, 1985. This mission was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments of which seven were in the field of astronomy and solar physics, three were for studies of the Earth's ionosphere, two were life science experiments, and 1 studied the properties of superfluid helium. England was responsible for activating and operating the Spacelab systems, operating the IPS and the Remote Manipulator System, assisting with experiment operations, and performing a contingency EVA had one been necessary. After 126 orbits of the Earth, STS 51-F Challenger landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. From May 1986 to May 1987, England served as a program scientist for Space Station Freedom (which later evolved into the International Space Station). From June 1987 to December 1987, he taught Remote Sensing Geophysics at Rice University. England retired from NASA in 1988. =Post-NASA career= England is dean of the College of Engineering and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn. He is also a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and atmospheric, oceanic, and of space sciences in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. =Personal= England was married for 51 years to his childhood sweetheart, Kathi (Kreutz) until her death in 2013 and has two daughters, Heidi and Heather. He has five grandchildren. He is currently married to Susan Mills Stretchberry. His recreational interests include sailing and amateur radio. England's career is chronicled in the book NASA's Scientist-Astronauts by David Shayler and Colin Burgess.

Abdominal cavity The female reproductive system is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in reproduction of new offspring. In humans, the female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a foetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the foetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix. At certain intervals, the ovaries release an ovum, which passes through the Fallopian tube into the uterus. If, in this transit, it meets with sperm, a single sperm (1-cell) can enter and merge with the egg or ovum (1-cell), fertilizing it into a zygote (1-cell). Fertilization usually occurs in the Fallopian tubes and marks the beginning of embryogenesis. The zygote will then divide over enough generations of cells to form a blastocyst, which implants itself in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period of gestation and the embryo will continue to develop until full-term. When the foetus has developed enough to survive outside the uterus, the cervix dilates and contractions of the uterus propel the newborn through the birth canal (the vagina). The corresponding equivalent among males is the male reproductive system. External organs The female external reproductive organs are the secondary organs that are visible externally. =Vulva= The vulva consists of all of the external parts and tissues and includes the mons pubis, pudendal cleft, labia majora, labia minora, Bartholin's glands, clitoris, and vaginal opening. Internal organs Sagittal MRI showing the location of the vagina, cervix, and uterus Illustration depicting female reproductive system (sagittal view) Frontal view as scheme of reproductive organs The female internal reproductive organs are the vagina, uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. =Vagina= The vagina is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous and muscular tissue) canal leading from the outside of the body to the cervix of the uterus or womb. It is also referred to as the birth canal in the context of pregnancy. The vagina accommodates the male penis during sexual intercourse. Semen containing spermatozoa is ejaculated from the male at orgasm, into the vagina potentially enabling fertilization of the egg cell (ovum) to take place. =Cervix= The cervix is the neck of the uterus, the lower, narrow portion where it joins with the upper part of the vagina. It is cylindrical or conical in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible, the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The vagina has a thick layer outside and it is the opening where the fetus emerges during delivery. =Uterus= The uterus or womb is the major female reproductive organ. The uterus provides mechanical protection, nutritional support, and waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus (from week 9 until the delivery). In addition, contractions in the muscular wall of the uterus are important in pushing out the fetus at the time of birth. The uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement. The uterosacral ligaments keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The round ligaments restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The cardinal ligaments also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus. The uterus is a pear-shaped muscular organ. Its major function is to accept a fertilized ovum which becomes implanted into the endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, develops into a fetus and gestates until childbirth. If the egg does not embed in the wall of the uterus, a female begins menstruation. =Fallopian tube= The Fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the uterus. On maturity of an ovum, the follicle and the ovary's wall rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the Fallopian tube. There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of cilia on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days. If the ovum is fertilized while in the Fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the endometrium when it reaches the uterus, which signals the beginning of pregnancy.The fallopian tubes made up of cillated columnar epithelium tissues =Ovaries= The ovaries are small, paired organs located near the lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. These organs are responsible for the production of the egg cells (ova) and the secretion of hormones. The process by which the egg cell (ovum) is released is called ovulation. The speed of ovulation is periodic and impacts directly to the length of a menstrual cycle. After ovulation, the egg cell is captured by the Fallopian tube, after traveling down the Fallopian tube to the uterus, occasionally being fertilized on its way by an incoming sperm. During fertilization the egg cell plays a role; it releases certain molecules that are essential to guiding the sperm and allows the surface of the egg to attach to the sperm's surface. The egg can then absorb the sperm and fertilization can then begin. The Fallopian tubes are lined with small hairs (cilia) to help the egg cell travel. Physiology The reproductive tract (or genital tract) is the lumen that starts as a single pathway through the vagina, splitting up into two lumens in the uterus, both of which continue through the Fallopian tubes, and ending at the distal ostia that open into the abdominal cavity. In the absence of fertilization, the ovum will eventually traverse the entire reproductive tract from the fallopian tube until exiting the vagina through menstruation. The reproductive tract can be used for various transluminal procedures such as fertiloscopy, intrauterine insemination, and transluminal sterilization. Development Chromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at conception. This is specifically based on the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited. Since the mother's egg contains an X chromosome and the father's sperm contains either an X or Y chromosome, it is the male who determines the fetus's sex. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. In this case, testosterone is not made and the Wolffian duct will degrade thus, the M√ºllerian duct will develop into female sex organs. The clitoris is the remnants of the Wolffian duct. On the other hand, if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct which will bring about the development of the male sex organs and the M√ºllerian duct will degrade. Clinical significance = Vaginitis = Vaginitis is inflammation of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It is the most common gynaecological condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for vaginitis because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a sexually transmitted infection as there are many infectious agents that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. Vaginitis is usually diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality. = Bacterial vaginosis = This is a vaginal infection in women. It differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis is polymicrobial, consisting of many bacteria species. The diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis is made if three of the following four criteria are present: (1) Homogenous, thin discharge, (2) a pH of 4.5 in the vagina, (3) epithelial cells in the vagina with bacteria attached to them, or (4) a fishy odor. It has been associated with an increased risk of other genital tract infections such as endometritis. = Yeast infection = This is a common cause of vaginal irritation and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at least 75% of adult women have experienced one at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of fungus in the vagina known as Candida. Yeast infections are usually caused by an imbalance of the pH in the vagina, which is usually acidic. Other factors such as pregnancy, diabetes, weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or douching can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast infections include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina. Women have also reported that they experience painful intercourse and urination as well. Taking a sample of the vaginal secretions and placing them under a microscope for evidence of yeast can diagnose a yeast infection. Treatment varies from creams that can be applied in or around the vaginal area to oral tablets that stop the growth of fungus. =Genital mutilation= There are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of genital mutilation practiced are clitoridectomy, the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the prepuce the skin around the clitoris. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as bleeding, irreparable tissue damage, and sepsis which can sometimes prove fatal. =Genital surgery= Genitoplasty refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs particularly following cancer and its treatment. There are also elective surgical procedures which change the appearance of the external genitals. Reproductive rights The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics was founded in 1954 to promote the well-being of women particularly in raising the standards of gynaecological practice and care. As of 2010 there were 124 countries involved. Reproductive rights are legal rights related to reproduction and reproductive health. Women have the right to control matters involving their sexuality including their sexual and reproductive health. Violation of these rights include forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, forced abortion and genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation is the complete or partial removal of a female's external genitals. History It is claimed in the Hippocratic writings that both males and females contribute their seed to conception; otherwise, children would not resemble either or both of their parents. Four-hundred years later, Galen \\"identified\\" the source of 'female semen' as the ovaries in female reproductive organs.Anwar, Etin. \\"The Transmission of Generative Self and Women's Contribution to Conception.\\" Gender and Self in Islam.

Ronald Ellwin Evans Jr., USN (November 10, 1933 ‚Äì April 7, 1990) was an American naval officer and aviator, electrical engineer, aeronautical engineer, NASA astronaut and, one of the 24 astronauts to have flown to the Moon, one of 12 people to have flown to the Moon without landing on it. Before becoming an astronaut, Evans graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas and joined the U.S. Navy. After receiving his naval aviator wings, Evans served as a fighter pilot and flew combat during the Vietnam War. In 1964 he received a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Achieving the rank of captain, he retired from the Navy in 1976. Evans was selected as an astronaut by NASA as part of Astronaut Group 5 in 1966 and made his only flight into space as Command Module Pilot aboard Apollo 17 in December 1972, the last crewed mission to the Moon, with Commander Eugene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt. During the flight, Evans and five mice orbited the Moon a record 75 timesNASA Apollo 17 summary page as his two crewmates descended to the surface. He is the last person to orbit the Moon alone and, at 148 hours, holds the record for the most time spent in lunar orbit. In 1975 Evans served as backup Command Module Pilot for the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project mission. During Apollo 17's return flight to Earth, Evans performed an extravehicular activity to retrieve film cassettes from the exterior of the spacecraft, the command and service module. It was the third \\"deep space\\" EVA, and is the spacewalk performed at the greatest distance from any planetary body. As of , it remains one of only three deep space EVAs, all made during the Apollo program's J-missions. It was also the final spacewalk of the Apollo program. Biography =Early life and education= Evans was born on November 10, 1933, in St. Francis, Kansas, to parents Clarence Ellwin Evans (1911‚Äì1985) and Marie A. Evans (; 1913‚Äì1992). He had two siblings, Larry Joe Evans (1935‚Äì1951) and Jay Evans.Ron Evans' family He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from Highland Park High School in Topeka, Kansas, in 1951, received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas in 1956, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1964. He was a member of Tau Beta Pi, Society of Sigma Xi, and Sigma Nu. =Military service= In June 1957 he completed flight training after receiving his commission as an Ensign through the Navy ROTC Program at the University of Kansas. Upon receiving his aviator wings in 1962, he was a fighter pilot with Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), serving on two aircraft carrier cruises in the Pacific Ocean, then a combat flight instructor for the F-8 aircraft with Fighter Squadron 124 (VF-124). From 1964 to 1966 Evans was on sea duty in the Pacific, assigned to Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51), flying F-8 Crusader from the carrier . During this assignment, he completed a seven-month tour of duty flying combat missions in Vietnam War. He was with VF-51 when he was selected as an astronaut in April 1966. Evans logged 5,100 hours of flight time, including 4,600 hours in jet aircraft. Evans during his trans-Earth EVA on Apollo 17 =NASA career= Evans was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as a member of the astronaut support crews for the Apollo 7 and Apollo 11 flights, and as backup Command Module Pilot for Apollo 14. Evans' only space flight was as Command Module Pilot of Apollo 17, the last scheduled U.S. crewed mission to the Moon. He was accompanied by Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. While Cernan and Schmitt landed and worked on the Moon in the Taurus‚ÄìLittrow valley, Evans remained in lunar orbit on board the Command Module America, completing assigned work tasks which required visual geological observations, hand-held photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras and other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the service module's SIM bay. The Blue Marble, an iconic photograph of Earth, is credited to the three crewmen of Apollo 17. On the way back to Earth, Evans completed a one-hour, six-minute extravehicular activity, successfully retrieving three camera cassettes and completing a personal inspection of the equipment bay area. He logged 301 hours and 51 minutes in space, 1 hour and 6 minutes of which were spent in extravehicular activity. He holds the record of most time spent in lunar orbit: six days and four hours (148 hours). Evans was later backup Command Module Pilot for the 1975 Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission. Evans retired from the U.S. Navy as Captain on April 30, 1976, with 21 years of service, and remained active as a NASA astronaut involved in the development of NASA's Space Shuttle program. He served as a member of the operations and training group within the Astronaut Office, responsible for launch and ascent phases of the Space Shuttle flight program. =Later years= Evans retired from NASA in March 1977 to pursue a career in the coal industry. Later he worked with Western American Energy Corporation in Scottsdale, Arizona, and was Director of Space Systems Marketing for Sperry Flight Systems. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in Scottsdale, Arizona, on April 7, 1990, and was survived by his widow Jan; his daughter, Jaime D. Evans (born August 21, 1959); and his son, Jon P. Evans (born October 9, 1961).Date of death according to death certificate issued by the State of Arizona on April 27, 1990, Certificate Number 169985, signed by G. E. Bolduc, MD. Awards and honors Evans was presented with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, the Johnson Space Center Superior Achievement Award in 1970, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal in 1973, Navy Astronaut Wings, eight Air Medals, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat distinguishing service in 1966. He received a University of Kansas Distinguished Service Citation in 1973, and was named Kansan of the Year in 1972. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983, and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on October 4, 1997.

A goodwill ambassador may be an individual from one country who resides in or travels to another country, on a diplomatic mission (or international friendship mission) at a peer to peer level; that is: country to country, state to state, city to city, or as an intermediate emissary representative of the people of a specific organization or cultural group such as an indigenous tribe or enclave population. Goodwill ambassadors have been a part of governments and countries for as long as diplomacy has existed. They represent their constituents by traveling abroad exchanging or delivering gifts and presents while bringing awareness to their cause or purpose through public relations activities and organizing events. Goodwill ambassadors are responsible for delivering humanitarian relief, implementing public programs and providing development assistance to demonstrate benevolence and compassion between parties. Most often nation- states and organizations use well-known celebrities such as actors, actresses, musicians, scientists, authors, former politicians and other high society figures; but they also engage civilians and government officials to fulfill the role. Goodwill missions of US states and international nations are usually carried out or overseen by the head of state, but do not necessarily involve official diplomatic credentials beyond a letter of presentation, letters patent or a letter of credence, it is very rare that goodwill ambassadors are ever issued a diplomatic passport. However, some countries, such as Haiti, do issue credentials that include diplomatic immunity for goodwill ambassadorsWyclef Jean, Ban Ki-Moon, Bill Clinton Visit Haiti to Raise Global Awareness and Needs of Devastated Country. and organizations sometimes issue a civil service credential or international identification such as a laissez- passer.  Governments and Countries  Most governments have goodwill ambassadors that are appointed or known implicitly that promote the objectives of the country or government, normally without promoting political agendas or official state business. (See public diplomacy and citizen diplomacy) Governments of countries often recognize the spouse of a president, governor, prime minister or a monarch as goodwill ambassadors such as the First-Lady of the United States, Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh for the British Empire, and in the Caribbean country of Belize there is the Special Envoy for Women and Children, all are formally recognized or known as national goodwill ambassadors. Many countries and their national states or provincial regions use goodwill ambassadors to promote tourism, economic development, traditional values, customs and cultural ideals that contribute to their recognition. = United States = US states have civil service recognition programs that designate goodwill ambassadors honorarily and officially who are responsible for promoting tourism, economic development, cultural events and the prosperity of the state in general. The oldest example of this is the Kentucky Colonel, which is the highest award bestowed by the state's governor, established in 1813, the honorary award is given to civilians based on performing a great deed, community service or for accomplishing a noteworthy achievement that deserves recognition. The distinction of Kentucky colonel entitles the recipient to use the honorary title of \\"Colonel\\" and is denoted through the issuance of letters patent and is an official designation. Other US states also have similar civilian awards that denote the role of goodwill ambassador which are well-recognized including that of the Tennessee Colonel, Rhode Island Commodore, Nebraska Admiral, Order of the Longleaf Pine, Arkansas Traveler, Yellow Rose of Texas, and Sagamore of the Wabash. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II bestows knighthood to her goodwill ambassadors upon being recognized for their contributions to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Nations, which entitles them to use the titles of \\"Sir\\" or \\"Dame\\" as Commanders of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. = Japan = Goodwill ambassadors are not always people, in 2008 Japan adopted the cartoon character Hello Kitty as their official goodwill tourism ambassador to China and Hong Kong. = Republic of Kosovo = Honorary Ambassador of the Republic of Kosovo is a title given to foreign citizens and citizens originating from Kosovo, who have contributed to the national interest of country and use their fame, the award is provided as a state decoration. Angelina Jolie, UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at the World Economic Forum with spouse Brad Pitt and Kofi Annan, Secretary-General, United Nations with his spouse in Davos, Switzerland in 2006 = United Nations = The United Nations agencies appoint and employ popular celebrities to advocate their missions including FAO, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNEP, UNFPA, UNODC, UNICEF, UNHCR, UNIDO, UNESCO, WFP, WHO, UNWOMEN, OHCHR, UN-Habitat, and IMO all have or may have goodwill ambassadors who are appointed officially by the UN. The largest of these United Nations programs is UNICEF which has over three hundred (300) ambassadors around the world designated by country or region. The United Nations began using goodwill ambassadors to promote their missions in 1954, the first was actor Danny Kaye. The most famous of today's contemporary goodwill ambassadors was Angelina Jolie, who currently serves professionally as a Special Envoy to the UNHCR. International Organizations A wide range of organizations employ goodwill ambassadors to promote their programs and reach out to others based on goodwill relations and benevolence. There are supra governmental organizations such as the African Union and the European Union and international non-governmental organizations like the IUCN and the IOM. Goodwill ambassadors are also used by social and civil society organizations such as Rotary International, the Olympic Games, the Muscular Dystrophy Association and the organization of goodwill ambassadors, Globcal International which provides practical training, international appointments and nominations for those who become members. = Amnesty International = The Ambassador of Conscience Award is Amnesty International's most prestigious human rights award. It celebrates individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by showing exceptional courage standing up to injustice and who have used their talents to inspire others. It also aims to generate debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of inspirational stories and human rights issues. = Civil Society Award Programs = Numerous governmental and nongovernmental organizations employ goodwill ambassadors following the practice of honoring individuals with awards that denote goodwill ambassador status and roles. Awards are given for good relations, fundraising, acts of philanthropy and recognition for cause advocacy; some examples of such recognition are comedian Trevor Noah who received a South African Goodwill Ambassador Award in 2015,Staff. \\"South Africa Prizes Noah\\".

Blue and purple areas indicate rising due to the removal of the ice sheets. Yellow and red areas indicate falling as mantle material moved away from these areas in order to supply the rising areas, and because of the collapse of the forebulges around the ice sheets. This layered beach at Bathurst Inlet, Nunavut is an example of post- glacial rebound after the last Ice Age. Little to no tide helped to form its layer-cake look. Isostatic rebound is still underway here. Post-glacial rebound (also called isostatic rebound or crustal rebound) is the rise of land masses after the removal of the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, which had caused isostatic depression. Post-glacial rebound and isostatic depression are phases of glacial isostasy (glacial isostatic adjustment, glacioisostasy), the deformation of the Earth's crust in response to changes in ice mass distribution. The direct raising effects of post- glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through the processes of ocean siphoning and continental levering, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.Milne, G.A., and J.X. Mitrovica (2008) Searching for eustasy in deglacial sea-level histories. Quaternary Science Reviews. 27:2292‚Äì2302. Overview Changes in the elevation of Lake Superior due to glaciation and post-glacial rebound During the last glacial period, much of northern Europe, Asia, North America, Greenland and Antarctica was covered by ice sheets, which reached up to three kilometres thick during the glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. The enormous weight of this ice caused the surface of the Earth's crust to deform and warp downward, forcing the viscoelastic mantle material to flow away from the loaded region. At the end of each glacial period when the glaciers retreated, the removal of this weight led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the return flow of mantle material back under the deglaciated area. Due to the extreme viscosity of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an equilibrium level. The uplift has taken place in two distinct stages. The initial uplift following deglaciation was almost immediate due to the elastic response of the crust as the ice load was removed. After this elastic phase, uplift proceeded by slow viscous flow at an exponentially decreasing rate. Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1 cm/year or less. In northern Europe, this is clearly shown by the GPS data obtained by the BIFROST GPS network. Studies suggest that rebound will continue for at least another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation depends on the local ice load and could be several hundred metres near the centre of rebound. Recently, the term \\"post-glacial rebound\\" is gradually being replaced by the term \\"glacial isostatic adjustment\\". This is in recognition that the response of the Earth to glacial loading and unloading is not limited to the upward rebound movement, but also involves downward land movement, horizontal crustal motion, changes in global sea levels and the Earth's gravity field, induced earthquakes, and changes in the Earth's rotation. Another alternate term is \\"glacial isostasy\\", because the uplift near the centre of rebound is due to the tendency towards the restoration of isostatic equilibrium (as in the case of isostasy of mountains). Unfortunately, that term gives the wrong impression that isostatic equilibrium is somehow reached, so by appending \\"adjustment\\" at the end, the motion of restoration is emphasized. Effects Post-glacial rebound produces measurable effects on vertical crustal motion, global sea levels, horizontal crustal motion, gravity field, Earth's rotation, crustal stress, and earthquakes. Studies of glacial rebound give us information about the flow law of mantle rocks, which is important to the study of mantle convection, plate tectonics and the thermal evolution of the Earth. It also gives insight into past ice sheet history, which is important to glaciology, paleoclimate, and changes in global sea level. Understanding postglacial rebound is also important to our ability to monitor recent global change. =Vertical crustal motion= Much of modern Finland is former seabed or archipelago: illustrated are sea levels immediately after the last ice age. Erratic boulders, U-shaped valleys, drumlins, eskers, kettle lakes, bedrock striations are among the common signatures of the Ice Age. In addition, post- glacial rebound has caused numerous significant changes to coastlines and landscapes over the last several thousand years, and the effects continue to be significant. In Sweden, Lake M√§laren was formerly an arm of the Baltic Sea, but uplift eventually cut it off and led to its becoming a freshwater lake in about the 12th century, at the time when Stockholm was founded at its outlet. Marine seashells found in Lake Ontario sediments imply a similar event in prehistoric times. Other pronounced effects can be seen on the island of √ñland, Sweden, which has little topographic relief due to the presence of the very level Stora Alvaret. The rising land has caused the Iron Age settlement area to recede from the Baltic Sea, making the present day villages on the west coast set back unexpectedly far from the shore. These effects are quite dramatic at the village of Alby, for example, where the Iron Age inhabitants were known to subsist on substantial coastal fishing. As a result of post- glacial rebound, the Gulf of Bothnia is predicted to eventually close up at Kvarken in more than 2,000 years. The Kvarken is a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site, selected as a \\"type area\\" illustrating the effects of post- glacial rebound and the holocene glacial retreat. In several other Nordic ports, like Tornio and Pori (formerly at Ulvila), the harbour has had to be relocated several times. Place names in the coastal regions also illustrate the rising land: there are inland places named 'island', 'skerry', 'rock', 'point' and 'sound'. For example, Oulunsalo \\"island of Oulujoki\\" is a peninsula, with inland names such as Koivukari \\"Birch Rock\\", Santaniemi \\"Sandy Cape\\", and Salmioja \\"the brook of the Sound\\". (Compare and .) Map of Post Glacial Rebound effects upon the land-level on the British Isles. In Great Britain, glaciation affected Scotland but not southern England, and the post- glacial rebound of northern Great Britain (up to 10 cm per century) is causing a corresponding downward movement of the southern half of the island (up to 5 cm per century). This will eventually lead to an increased risk of floods in southern England and south-western Ireland. Since the glacial isostatic adjustment process causes the land to move relative to the sea, ancient shorelines are found to lie above present day sea level in areas that were once glaciated. On the other hand, places in the peripheral bulge area which was uplifted during glaciation now begins to subside. Therefore, ancient beaches are found below present day sea level in the bulge area. The \\"relative sea level data\\", which consists of height and age measurements of the ancient beaches around the world, tells us that glacial isostatic adjustment proceeded at a higher rate near the end of deglaciation than today. The present-day uplift motion in northern Europe is also monitored by a GPS network called BIFROST. Results of GPS data show a peak rate of about 11 mm/year in the north part of the Gulf of Bothnia, but this uplift rate decreases away and becomes negative outside the former ice margin. In the near field outside the former ice margin, the land sinks relative to the sea. This is the case along the east coast of the United States, where ancient beaches are found submerged below present day sea level and Florida is expected to be submerged in the future. GPS data in North America also confirms that land uplift becomes subsidence outside the former ice margin. =Global sea levels= To form the ice sheets of the last Ice Age, water from the oceans evaporated, condensed as snow and was deposited as ice in high latitudes. Thus global sea level fell during glaciation. The ice sheets at the last glacial maximum were so massive that global sea level fell by about 120 metres. Thus continental shelves were exposed and many islands became connected with the continents through dry land. This was the case between the British Isles and Europe (Doggerland), or between Taiwan, the Indonesian islands and Asia (Sundaland). A sub-continent also existed between Siberia and Alaska that allowed the migration of people and animals during the last glacial maximum. The fall in sea level also affects the circulation of ocean currents and thus has important impact on climate during the glacial maximum. During deglaciation, the melted ice water returns to the oceans, thus sea level in the ocean increases again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of the melted ice water is not the same everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of the melted water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation. =Horizontal crustal motion= Accompanying vertical motion is the horizontal motion of the crust. The BIFROST GPS network shows that the motion diverges from the centre of rebound. However, the largest horizontal velocity is found near the former ice margin. The situation in North America is less certain; this is due to the sparse distribution of GPS stations in northern Canada, which is rather inaccessible. =Post-glacial rebound and isostasy= Vertical motion of a crustal block means that this block is not in isostatic equilibrium. However, it is in the process of reaching this equilibrium. =Tilt= The combination of horizontal and vertical motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away from the direction of the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink. This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, Lake Pielinen in Finland, which is large (90 x 30 km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake H√∂yti√§inen. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to burst through the Uimaharju esker at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river (Pielisjoki) that runs to the sea via Lake Pyh√§selk√§ to Lake Saimaa. The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus important for water resource management planning. In Sweden Lake Sommen's outlet in the northwest has a rebound of is 2.36 mm/a while in the eastern Svanaviken it is 2.05 mm/a. This means the lake is being slowly tilted and the southeastern shores drowned. =Gravity field= Ice, water and mantle rocks have mass, and as they move around, they exert a gravitational pull on other masses towards them. Thus, the gravity field, which is sensitive to all mass on the surface and within the Earth, is affected by the redistribution of ice/melted water on the surface of the Earth and the flow of mantle rocks within. Today, more than 6000 years after the last deglaciation terminated, the flow of mantle material back to the glaciated area causes the overall shape of the Earth to become less oblate. This change in the topography of Earth's surface affects the long-wavelength components of the gravity field. The changing gravity field can be detected by repeated land measurements with absolute gravimeters and recently by the GRACE satellite mission. The change in long-wavelength components of Earth's gravity field also perturbs the orbital motion of satellites and has been detected by LAGEOS satellite motion. =Vertical datum= The vertical datum is a theoretical reference surface for altitude measurement and plays vital roles in many human activities, including land surveying and construction of buildings and bridges. Since postglacial rebound continuously deforms the crustal surface and the gravitational field, the vertical datum needs to be redefined repeatedly through time. =State of stress, intraplate earthquakes and volcanism= According to the theory of plate tectonics, plate-plate interaction results in earthquakes near plate boundaries. However, large earthquakes are found in intraplate environment like eastern Canada (up to M7) and northern Europe (up to M5) which are far away from present-day plate boundaries. An important intraplate earthquake was the magnitude 8 New Madrid earthquake that occurred in mid-continental US in the year 1811. Glacial loads provided more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada and more than 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum. This vertical stress is supported by the mantle and the flexure of the lithosphere. Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the state of stress at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the state of stress is recorded in the postglacial faults in southeastern Canada. When the postglacial faults formed at the end of deglaciation 9000 years ago, the horizontal principal stress orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast-southwest, along the direction of seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This shows that the stress due to postglacial rebound had played an important role at deglacial time, but has gradually relaxed so that tectonic stress has become more dominant today. According to the Mohr‚ÄìCoulomb theory of rock failure, large glacial loads generally suppress earthquakes, but rapid deglaciation promotes earthquakes. According to Wu & Hasagawa, the rebound stress that is available to trigger earthquakes today is of the order of 1 MPa. This stress level is not large enough to rupture intact rocks but is large enough to reactivate pre-existing faults that are close to failure. Thus, both postglacial rebound and past tectonics play important roles in today's intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and southeast US. Generally postglacial rebound stress could have triggered the intraplate earthquakes in eastern Canada and may have played some role in triggering earthquakes in the eastern US including the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811. The situation in northern Europe today is complicated by the current tectonic activities nearby and by coastal loading and weakening. Increasing pressure due to the weight of the ice during glaciation may have suppressed melt generation and volcanic activities below Iceland and Greenland. On the other hand, decreasing pressure due to deglaciation can increase the melt production and volcanic activities by 20-30 times. =Recent global warming= Recent global warming has caused mountain glaciers and the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt and global sea level to rise. Therefore, monitoring sea level rise and the mass balance of ice sheets and glaciers allows people to understand more about global warming. Recent rise in sea levels has been monitored by tide gauges and satellite altimetry (e.g. TOPEX/Poseidon). As well as the addition of melted ice water from glaciers and ice sheets, recent sea level changes are affected by the thermal expansion of sea water due to global warming, sea level change due to deglaciation of the last glacial maximum (postglacial sea level change), deformation of the land and ocean floor and other factors. Thus, to understand global warming from sea level change, one must be able to separate all these factors, especially postglacial rebound, since it is one of the leading factors. Mass changes of ice sheets can be monitored by measuring changes in the ice surface height, the deformation of the ground below and the changes in the gravity field over the ice sheet. Thus ICESat, GPS and GRACE satellite mission are useful for such purpose. However, glacial isostatic adjustment of the ice sheets affect ground deformation and the gravity field today. Thus understanding glacial isostatic adjustment is important in monitoring recent global warming. One of the possible impacts of global warming-triggered rebound may be more volcanic activity in previously ice-capped areas such as Iceland and Greenland. It may also trigger intraplate earthquakes near the ice margins of Greenland and Antarctica. Unusually rapid (up to 4.1 cm/year) present glacial isostatic rebound due to recent ice mass losses in the Amundsen Sea embayment region of Antarctica coupled with low regional mantle viscosity is predicted to provide a modest stabilizing influence on marine ice sheet instability in West Antarctica, but likely not to a sufficient degree to arrest it. Applications The speed and amount of postglacial rebound is determined by two factors: the viscosity or rheology (i.e., the flow) of the mantle, and the ice loading and unloading histories on the surface of Earth. The viscosity of the mantle is important in understanding mantle convection, plate tectonics, dynamical processes in Earth, the thermal state and thermal evolution of Earth. However viscosity is difficult to observe because creep experiments of mantle rocks at natural strain rates would take thousands of years to observe and the ambient temperature and pressure conditions are not easy to attain for a long enough time. Thus, the observations of postglacial rebound provide a natural experiment to measure mantle rheology. Modelling of glacial isostatic adjustment addresses the question of how viscosity changes in the radial and lateral directions and whether the flow law is linear, nonlinear, or composite rheology. Mantle viscosity may additionally be estimated using seismic tomography, where seismic velocity is used as a proxy observable Ice thickness histories are useful in the study of paleoclimatology, glaciology and paleo-oceanography. Ice thickness histories are traditionally deduced from the three types of information: First, the sea level data at stable sites far away from the centers of deglaciation give an estimate of how much water entered the oceans or equivalently how much ice was locked up at glacial maximum. Secondly, the location and dates of terminal moraines tell us the areal extent and retreat of past ice sheets. Physics of glaciers gives us the theoretical profile of ice sheets at equilibrium, it also says that the thickness and horizontal extent of equilibrium ice sheets are closely related to the basal condition of the ice sheets. Thus the volume of ice locked up is proportional to their instantaneous area. Finally, the heights of ancient beaches in the sea level data and observed land uplift rates (e.g. from GPS or VLBI) can be used to constrain local ice thickness. A popular ice model deduced this way is the ICE5G model. Because the response of the Earth to changes in ice height is slow, it cannot record rapid fluctuation or surges of ice sheets, thus the ice sheet profiles deduced this way only gives the \\"average height\\" over a thousand years or so. Glacial isostatic adjustment also plays an important role in understanding recent global warming and climate change. Discovery Before the eighteenth century, it was thought, in Sweden, that sea levels were falling. On the initiative of Anders Celsius a number of marks were made in rock on different locations along the Swedish coast. In 1765 it was possible to conclude that it was not a lowering of sea levels but an uneven rise of land. In 1865 Thomas Jamieson came up with a theory that the rise of land was connected with the ice age that had been first discovered in 1837. The theory was accepted after investigations by Gerard De Geer of old shorelines in Scandinavia published in 1890. Legal implications In areas where the rising of land is seen, it is necessary to define the exact limits of property. In Finland, the \\"new land\\" is legally the property of the owner of the water area, not any land owners on the shore. Therefore, if the owner of the land wishes to build a pier over the \\"new land\\", they need the permission of the owner of the (former) water area. The landowner of the shore may redeem the new land at market price. Usually the owner of the water area is the partition unit of the landowners of the shores, a collective holding corporation.

Conservation status Mniarogekko chahoua is currently being evaluated by CITES as a possible candidate for protective status. Taxonomy and systematics Mniarogekko chahoua was first described in 1869 as Platydactylus chahoua by Arthur Bavay, a French pharmacist and herpetologist.Beolens B, Watkins M, Grayson M. (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Rhacodactylus chahoua, p. 19). Description Mniarogekko chahoua gets its common name from the moss or lichen-like pattern it displays. Colors range from rusty red and brown to green or gray. There has been some notation that color could possibly be a geographic indicator in this species as the geckos from the outer islands most often display the lighter gray patterns. It commonly reaches a snout to vent length (SVL) of . It possesses a strong, well-muscled, fully prehensile tail and is not subject to dropping it as readily as some of its relatives. Diet Mniarogekko chahoua, like all of the New Caledonian geckos, are omnivores. Their diet in the wild consists of various insects and fruits. They may also consume small lizards. Reproduction Mniarogekko chahoua lays two well calcified eggs that become adhered to one another shortly after laying. This is known as \\"egg gluing\\". Mniarogekko chahoua is the only Rhacodactylus gecko that lays adhering eggs. The eggs are generally laid on top of the substrate (generally behind loose tree bark) and are guarded by the female. The eggs hatch 60‚Äì90 days after laying. Herpetoculture This gecko is seen in herpetoculture but rarely. A male-female pair may be kept in a terrarium with a minimum size of , but as with all arboreal geckos, the taller the enclosure the better. Plenty of hiding spaces including cork rounds and bushy plants should be used in the enclosure. References Further reading * Bauer AM, Jackman TR, Sadlier RA, Whitaker AH.

It was originally developed by AT&T; and first released in 1983. Four major versions of System V were released, numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. System V Release 4 (SVR4) was commercially the most successful version, being the result of an effort, marketed as Unix System Unification, which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors. It was the source of several common commercial Unix features. System V is sometimes abbreviated to SysV. , the AT&T-derived; Unix market is divided between three System V variants: IBM's AIX, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX and Oracle's Solaris.  Overview  = Introduction = Unix history tree AT&T; System V license plate System V was the successor to 1982's UNIX System III. While AT&T; developed and sold hardware that ran System V, most customers ran a version from a reseller, based on AT&T;'s reference implementation. A standards document called the System V Interface Definition outlined the default features and behavior of implementations. = AT&T; support = During the formative years of AT&T;'s computer business, the division went through several phases of System V software groups, beginning with the Unix Support Group (USG), followed by Unix System Development Laboratory (USDL), followed by AT&T; Information Systems (ATTIS), and finally Unix System Laboratories (USL). = Rivalry with BSD = In the 1980s and early-1990s, UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) were the two major versions of UNIX. Historically, BSD was also commonly called \\"BSD Unix\\" or \\"Berkeley Unix\\".Garfinkel, Simson. Spafford, Gene. Schwartz, Alan. Practical UNIX and Internet Security. 2003. pp. 15-20 Eric S. Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period:Raymond, Eric S. The Art of Unix Programming. 2003. p. 38 While HP, IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings, other vendors such as Sun Microsystems and DEC extended BSD. Throughout its development, though, System V was infused with features from BSD, while BSD variants such as DEC's Ultrix received System V features. AT&T; and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD-based SunOS to produce Solaris, one of the primary System V descendants still in use today. Since the early 1990s, due to standardization efforts such as POSIX and the commercial success of Linux, the division between System V and BSD has become less important.  Releases  Blit, connected to a SVR3 host and showing the Layers interface = SVR1 = System V, known inside Bell Labs as Unix 5.0, succeeded AT&T;'s previous commercial Unix called System III in January, 1983. Unix 4.0 was never released externally, which would have been designated as System IV. This first release of System V (called System V.0, System V Release 1, or SVR1) was developed by AT&T;'s UNIX Support Group (USG) and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX 5.0. System V also included features such as the vi editor and curses from 4.1 BSD, developed at the University of California, Berkeley; it also improved performance by adding buffer and inode caches. It also added support for inter-process communication using messages, semaphores, and shared memory, developed earlier for the Bell-internal CB UNIX. SVR1 ran on DEC PDP-11 and VAX minicomputers. = SVR2 = The DEC VAX-11/780 was the porting base for SVR2 AT&T;'s UNIX Support Group (USG) transformed into the UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL), which released System V Release 2 in 1984. SVR2 added shell functions and the SVID. SVR2.4 added demand paging, copy-on-write, shared memory, and record and file locking. The concept of the \\"porting base\\" was formalized, and the DEC VAX-11/780 was chosen for this release. The \\"porting base\\" is the so-called original version of a release, from which all porting efforts for other machines emanate. Educational source licenses for SVR2 were offered by AT&T; for US$800 for the first CPU, and $400 for each additional CPU. A commercial source license was offered for $43,000, with three months of support, and a $16,000 price per additional CPU. Apple Computer's A/UX operating system was initially based on this release. SCO XENIX also used SVR2 as its basis. The first release of HP-UX was also an SVR2 derivative. Maurice J. Bach's book, The Design of the UNIX Operating System, is the definitive description of the SVR2 kernel. = SVR3 = 3B2 line of minicomputers was the porting base for SVR3 AT&T;'s UNIX System Development Laboratory (USDL) was succeeded by AT&T; Information Systems (ATTIS), which distributed UNIX System V, Release 3, in 1987. SVR3 included STREAMS, Remote File Sharing (RFS), the File System Switch (FSS) virtual file system mechanism, a restricted form of shared libraries, and the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) network API. The final version was Release 3.2 in 1988, which added binary compatibility to Xenix on Intel platforms (see Intel Binary Compatibility Standard). User interface improvements included the \\"layers\\" windowing system for the DMD 5620 graphics terminal, and the SVR3.2 curses libraries that offered eight or more color pairs and other at this time important features (forms, panels, menus, etc.). The AT&T; 3B2 became the official \\"porting base.\\" SCO UNIX was based upon SVR3.2, as was ISC 386/ix. Among the more obscure distributions of SVR3.2 for the 386 were ESIX 3.2 by Everex and \\"System V, Release 3.2\\" sold by Intel themselves; these two shipped \\"plain vanilla\\" AT&T;'s codebase. IBM's AIX operating system is an SVR3 derivative. = SVR4 = HP 9000 C110 running HP-UX in console mode OpenWindows, an early desktop environment for SVR4 HP 9000 735 running HP-UX with the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) A GNOME-based OpenSolaris desktop Sun Ultra 20 with Solaris 10 System V Release 4.0 was announced on October 18, 1988 and was incorporated into a variety of commercial Unix products from early 1989 onwards. A joint project of AT&T; Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems, it combined technology from: * SVR3 * 4.3BSD * Xenix * SunOS New features included: * From BSD: TCP/IP support, sockets, UFS, support for multiple groups, C shell. * From SunOS: the virtual file system interface (replacing the File System Switch in System V release 3), NFS, new virtual memory system including support for memory mapped files, an improved shared library system based on the SunOS 4.x model, the OpenWindows GUI environment, External Data Representation (XDR) and ONC RPC. * From Xenix: x86 device drivers, binary compatibility with Xenix (in the x86 version of System V). * Korn shell. * ANSI X3J11 C compatibility. * Multi-National Language Support (MNLS). * Better internationalization support. * An application binary interface (ABI) based on Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). * Support for standards such as POSIX and X/Open. Many companies licensed SVR4 and bundled it with computer systems such as workstations and network servers. SVR4 systems vendors included Atari (Atari System V), Commodore (Amiga Unix), Data General (DG/UX), Fujitsu (UXP/DS), Hitachi (HI-UX), Hewlett-Packard (HP-UX), NCR (Unix/NS), NEC (EWS-UX, UP-UX, UX/4800, SUPER-UX), OKI (OKI System V), Pyramid Technology (DC/OSx), SGI (IRIX), Siemens (SINIX), Sony (NEWS-OS), Sumitomo Electric Industries (SEIUX), and Sun Microsystems (Solaris) with illumos in the 2010s as the only open-source platform. Software porting houses also sold enhanced and supported Intel x86 versions. SVR4 software vendors included Dell (Dell UNIX), Everex (ESIX), Micro Station Technology (SVR4), Microport (SVR4), and UHC (SVR4).Eric S. Raymond, A buyer's guide to UNIX versions for PC-clone hardware, posted to Usenet November 16, 1994. The primary platforms for SVR4 were Intel x86 and SPARC; the SPARC version, called Solaris 2 (or, internally, SunOS 5.x), was developed by Sun. The relationship between Sun and AT&T; was terminated after the release of SVR4, meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR4.x releases. Sun would in 2005 release most of the source code for Solaris 10 (SunOS 5.10) as the open-source OpenSolaris project, creating, with its forks, the only open-source (albeit heavily modified) System V implementation available. After Oracle took over Sun, Solaris was forked into proprietary release, but illumos as the continuation project is being developed in open-source. A consortium of Intel-based resellers including Unisys, ICL, NCR Corporation, and Olivetti developed SVR4.0MP with multiprocessing capability (allowing system calls to be processed from any processor, but interrupt servicing only from a \\"master\\" processor). Release 4.1 ES (Enhanced Security) added security features required for Orange Book B2 compliance and Access Control Lists and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules. = SVR4.2 / UnixWare = In 1992, AT&T; USL engaged in a joint venture with Novell, called Univel. That year saw the release System V.4.2 as Univel UnixWare, featuring the Veritas File System. Other vendors included UHC and Consensys. Release 4.2MP, completed late 1993, added support for multiprocessing and it was released as UnixWare 2 in 1995. Eric S. Raymond warned prospective buyers about SVR4.2 versions, as they often did not include on-line man pages. In his 1994 buyers guide, he attributes this change in policy to Unix System Laboratories. = SVR5 / UnixWare 7 = The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), owners of Xenix, eventually acquired the UnixWare trademark and the distribution rights to the System V Release 4.2 codebase from Novell, while other vendors (Sun, IBM, HP) continued to use and extend System V Release 4. Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to The Open Group. Any operating system that meets the Single Unix Specification (SUS), effectively a successor to the System V Interface Definition, may be granted Unix rights. The SUS is met by Apple's macOS, a BSD derivative, as well as several other operating systems not derived from either BSD or System V. System V Release 5 was developed in 1997 by the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) as a merger of SCO OpenServer (an SVR3-derivative) and UnixWare, with a focus on large-scale servers. It was released as SCO UnixWare 7. SCO's successor, The SCO Group, also based SCO OpenServer 6 on SVR5, but the codebase is not used by any other major developer or reseller. = SVR6 (cancelled) = System V Release 6 was announced by SCO to be released by the end of 2004, but was apparently cancelled.SCO updates Unix, OpenServer product plans InfoWorld, August 19, 2003 It was supposed to support 64-bit systems.SCO UNIX Roadmap at Archive.is The industry has coalesced around The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification version 3 (UNIX 03). See also: Smallfoot  Market position  MATE desktop on OpenIndiana, an SVR4 derivative = Availability during the 1990s on x86 platforms = In the 1980s and 1990s, a variety of SVR4 versions of Unix were available commercially for the x86 PC platform. However, the market for commercial Unix on PCs declined after Linux and BSD became widely available. In late 1994, Eric S. Raymond discontinued his PC- clone UNIX Software Buyer's Guide on USENET, stating, \\"The reason I am dropping this is that I run Linux now, and I no longer find the SVr4 market interesting or significant.\\" In 1998, a confidential memo at Microsoft stated, \\"Linux is on track to eventually own the x86 UNIX market\\", and further predicted, \\"I believe that Linux ‚Äì moreso than NT ‚Äì will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future.\\" An InfoWorld article from 2001 characterized SCO UnixWare as having a \\"bleak outlook\\" due to being \\"trounced\\" in the market by Linux and Solaris, and IDC predicted that SCO would \\"continue to see a shrinking share of the market\\". = Project Monterey = Project Monterey was started in 1998 to combine major features of existing commercial Unix platforms, as a joint project of Compaq, IBM, Intel, SCO, and Sequent Computer Systems. The target platform was meant to be Intel's new IA-64 architecture and Itanium line of processors. However, the project was abruptly canceled in 2001 after little progress.Raymond, Eric S. The Art of Unix Programming. 2003. p. 43 = System V and the Unix market = By 2001, several major Unix variants such as SCO UnixWare, Compaq Tru64 UNIX, and SGI IRIX were all in decline. The three major Unix versions doing well in the market were IBM AIX, Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX, and Sun's Solaris. In 2006, when SGI declared bankruptcy, analysts questioned whether Linux would replace proprietary Unix altogether. In a 2006 article written for Computerworld by Mark Hall, the economics of Linux were cited as a major factor driving the migration from Unix to Linux: The article also cites trends in high-performance computing applications as evidence of a dramatic shift from Unix to Linux: In a November 2015 survey of the top 500 supercomputers, Unix was used by only 1.2% (all running IBM AIX), while Linux was used by 98.8%; the same survey in November 2017 reports 100% of them using Linux. System V derivatives continued to be deployed on some proprietary server platforms. The principal variants of System V that remain in commercial use are AIX (IBM), Solaris (Oracle), and HP-UX (HP). According to a study done by IDC, in 2012 the worldwide Unix market was divided between IBM (56%), Oracle (19.2%), and HP (18.6%). No other commercial Unix vendor had more than 2% of the market. Industry analysts generally characterize proprietary Unix as having entered a period of slow but permanent decline. = OpenSolaris and illumos distributions= OpenSolaris and its derivatives are the only SVR4 descendants that are open-source software. Core system software continues to be developed as illumos used in illumos distributions such as SmartOS, OpenIndiana and others. = System V compatibility = The System V interprocess communication mechanisms are available in Unix-like operating systems not derived from System V; in particular, in Linux (a reimplementation of Unix) as well as the BSD derivative FreeBSD. POSIX 2008 specifies a replacement for these interfaces. FreeBSD maintains a binary compatibility layer for the COFF format, which allows FreeBSD to execute binaries compiled for some SVR3.2 derivatives such as SCO UNIX and Interactive UNIX.Lehey, Greg. The Complete FreeBSD: Documentation from the Source. 2003. pp. 164-165 Modern System V, Linux, and BSD platforms use the ELF file format for natively compiled binaries.

Culinary use  Fil√© powder is used in Louisiana Creole cuisine in the making of some types of gumbo, a thick Creole soup or stew often served over rice. Several different varieties exist. In New Orleans, what is known as Creole gumbo generally varies from house to house though still retaining its Native American origins. The Creoles of Cane River make a gumbo focused much more on fil√©. Fil√© can provide thickening when okra is not in season, in types of gumbo that use okra or a roux as a thickener for gumbo instead of fil√©.Howard Mitcham (1978), Creole Gumbo and All That Jazz, , as quoted in How to make Homemade File Powder at Nola Cuisine Sprinkled sparingly over gumbo as a seasoning and a thickening agent, fil√© powder adds a distinctive, earthy flavor and texture. Fil√© powder is made by harvesting the young leaves and stems of the sassafras tree and grinding them. Fil√© powder is generally not added until after the vegetables and meats or seafood are finished cooking and removed from the heat source.  History and etymology Choctaw Indians of the American South (Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana) were the first to use dried, ground sassafras leaves as a seasoning. The French word fil√© is the past participle of the verb filer, meaning (among other things) \\"to turn into threads\\", \\"to become ropy\\". The name may derive from the word \\"ki ngombo\\", often shortened to \\"gombo\\", which meant okra in the Central Bantu dialect. Okra was a common thickener in soups and stews prepared by the African inhabitants of Louisiana, who were brought to the colony in large numbers beginning in 1719. Some scholars have suggested that the gumbo was adapted from the West African soups and stews which were thickened with okra. Eventually, okra was replaced as a thickener with the traditional sassafras. The earliest known mention of the dish is from a transcript of the interrogation of an enslaved African woman named Comba in 1764. In it, she states that she gave \\"un gombeau\\" to another slave. Other scholars have suggested that the name may derive from the Choctaw word for fil√© (kombo). Some early 20th century authors, most notably Celestine Eustis, suggested that gumbo including fil√© powder was an early special-occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Creole practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Creoles. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes.  Health concerns  Safrole and sassafras oil have been banned by the FDA as a carcinogen since 1960 and can not be used in food manufacture for this reason. According to a study published in 1997, the tree's leaves (from which fil√© is produced), do not contain detectable amounts of safrole.  Cultural references  \\"Fil√© gumbo\\" is famously mentioned in the classic country song by Hank Williams Sr., \\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\\", which held the number-one position on the U.S. country music charts for fourteen non-consecutive weeks in 1952.

To date, twenty-six novels have been published in the main series, with some novels comprising as many as four volumes. The series has also spawned anime, audio drama, manga, comic adaptations, a video game, as well as a short story collection, art books, and a supplemental guide book. Plot introduction D wanders through a far-future post-nuclear Earth that combines elements of pulp genres: western, science fiction, horror and Lovecraftian horror, high fantasy, folklore and occult science. The planet, once terrified by the elegant but cruel Nobles (vampires), ancient demons, mutants and their technological creations, is now slowly returning to a semblance of order and human control‚Äîthanks in part to the decadence that brought about the downfall of the vampire race, to the continued stubbornness of frontier dwellers, and to the rise of a caste of independent hunters-for- hire who eliminate supernatural threats. Some time in 1999, a nuclear war occurred. The Nobility were vampires that planned for a possible nuclear war and sequestered all that was needed to rebuild civilization in their shelters. They use their science combined with magic to restore the world in their image. Nearly all magical creatures are engineered, with a very small number being demons who survived the holocaust. Despite their technology being great enough to create a blood substitute as food, they still prefer to feed on humans. As such, they create a civilization where vampires and humans coexist, eventually developing the planet into parklands and cities. The society eventually stagnates when vampire technology perfects scientific prophecy, which determines they are at their zenith of existence and thus are doomed to fall, overthrown by humans. The human race was also transformed at this time, with fear for the vampires being woven into their genetics, and the inability to remember vampire weaknesses such as garlic and crucifixes. Unlike vampires from traditional lore, the Nobility have the ability to reproduce sexually, although their offspring will permanently cease aging after reaching physical maturity, having inherited their vampire parent's immortality. Main characters = D = D is a dhampir, the half-breed child of a vampire father and human mother, the ideal vampire hunter. He is renowned for his consummate skill and unearthly grace, but feared and despised for his mixed lineage: born of both races but belonging to neither. Often underestimated by his opponents, D possesses surprising power and resourcefulness, having most of the strengths of the Nobility and only mild levels of their common weaknesses. It has been seen in both movies that his power is not only physical, but extends into the magical realm as well. His supernatural powers make him one of the strongest beings in the world, if not the second strongest (second only to his father). However, D prefers his physical abilities, only using his magic in times of great need. Unlike most dhampirs, D is able to live as a \\"normal\\" human; however, he is marked by his unearthly beauty and exceptionally powerful aura, and thus rarely accepted by human settlements. In terms of weaknesses, he is randomly susceptible to sun-sickness, a severe type of sunstroke, about once every five years (far less than most dhampirs). D also recovers from it at a rate far greater than other dhampirs. Usually it takes several days to recover from sunlight syndrome, longer if the dhampir is exceedingly powerful, but D recovered in a few hours (around 1‚Äì6 hours approximately) despite being one of the strongest dhampirs alive. Otherwise, D does not appear to suffer from other vampiric weaknesses usual to dhampirs, being able to physically restrain opponents with his aura and having godlike reflexes surpassing even those of Nobles. His symbiotic left hand states, in \\"Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust: \\"The three of you became impatient with the heartless Bastet and impaled her on 'The Sword'\\". Speculation on whether \\"The Sword\\" is D's sword or not is debatable. It is important to note here, however, that the movie differs sharply from the book it takes its story from, Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase, and future entries in the novel series do not differentiate between Dracula, The Vampire King, The Sacred Ancestor and D's father, proposing that they are one and the same. D rides a cybernetic horse with mechanical legs and other enhancements, wields a crescent longsword which looks similar to Yoshitaka Amano's scimitar sword design found in many of his works of art, but the sword has a hefty length, similar to that of a Japanese nodachi. D always wears a mystical blue pendant; it prevents many of the automatic defenses (such as laser fields and small nuclear blasters) created by the Nobility in past millennia from working properly, and allows him to enter their sealed castles. In the novels and game, he also uses wooden needles which he can throw with super speed. He protects his milk-white face from the noonday sun with long black hair, flowing black clothing and cape, and the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. D is described as appearing as a youth between 17 and 18 years old, though D's age is unknown (although in the novel Pale Fallen Angel parts I and II, it is made known that he is at least 5,000 years old). His beauty is mesmerizing, often unintentionally wooing women and sometimes flustering men. Very little is known of D's past and the identity of his parents is ambiguous, but his innate power suggests that his father is an extraordinarily powerful vampire. Regarding D's birth, some Nobles whisper dark rumors about their vampire progenitor, the Sacred Ancestor known as Count Dracula, bedding a human woman called \\"Mina the Fair\\" (implied to be Mina Harker). Dracula conducted bizarre crossbreeding experiments involving himself and countless human women or even other vampires, with the only successful product of the experiments being D. D, wanting nothing to do with his father save for killing him, refuses to go by his true name. Instead, he shortens it to the first letter. In Twin Shadowed Knight it is revealed that D has a twin who goes unnamed. The twin states that he and D were born from the same woman in exactly the same conditions. = Left Hand = The symbiote that resides in D's left hand D is the host for a sentient symbiote, Left Hand, a wisecracking homunculus with a human face residing in his left palm, who can suck in massive amounts of matter through a wind void or vacuum tunnel. Left Hand enjoys needling the poker-faced D, but only appears as needed, rarely witnessed or heard by anyone other than D, yet aware of many of D's thoughts and actions. At all other times, D's left hand appears normal. Besides providing a contrast to D's reserved demeanor, Left Hand is incredibly useful, possessing many mysterious powers such as psychometry, inducing sleep, determining the medical condition of a victim, and the ability to size up the supernatural powers or prowess of an enemy, even beyond D's keen senses. In the first and second novels, Left Hand can also revive D when his physical condition is suffering, by consuming the four elements and converting the resulting energy into life force. This ability even saved D from the usually fatal stake through the heart he received from Rei-Ginsei in the first novel. Left Hand has its own mind and will, and acts as D's guide and sole permanent companion, providing a reservoir of knowledge pertaining to the lost Noble culture. So far, Left Hand's origins are unknown, and it is unclear how they came to be joined. However, some of its nature is revealed in the third book, which features a similar creature; it is implied he was one of the Barbarois (human/monster hybrids) who served in the personal retinue of Count Dracula. = Dracula = Dracula's role in the novels is very mixed, appearing both as the bane and savior to isolated towns, and deified as a legendary god-king to the vampires, many of whom have never even met him in person. D quotes Dracula's precepts (\\"Transient guests are we\\"‚Äîimplied to refer to the Nobility) in the first novel. Dracula appears both as a lawgiver honored for his intelligence, who showed some interest in preserving humans, and as a ruthless scientist (in the second novel), conducting hybrid breeding experiments with humans in order to perpetuate his own dwindling species. D appears to have encountered his alleged father on at least one occasion, as when at times D reaches a place where the imprint of Dracula's power remains, D remembers Dracula telling him that \\"You are my only success.\\" Like D, Dracula is portrayed as a mysterious and handsome young wanderer who deals with both life and death. However, in the English dub of the anime, D states that Dracula respected humanity and did not feed on innocent people. Publication history Beginning in 1983, Kikuchi has so far written 31 Vampire Hunter novels spanning 44 volumes. All of the official publications in the series were originally published by Asahi Sonorama until the Sonorama branch went out of business in September 2007. The release of D ‚Äì Throng of Heretics in October 2007 under the Asahi Bunko ‚Äì Sonorama Selection label marked the transition to the new publisher, Asahi Shimbun Publishing, a division of Asahi Sonorama's parent company. From December 2007 through January 2008, Asahi Shimbun Publishing reprinted the complete Vampire Hunter catalogue under the Sonorama Selection label. On May 11, 2005, the first official English translation was released under DH Press, translated by Kevin Leahy. As of November 2016, 21 novels have been translated into and released in English, spanning 24 volumes. In January 2011, Hideyuki Kikuchi published the first spinoff set in the Vampire Hunter universe, a series of prequels titled , illustrated by Ayami Kojima, artist and character designer for the Castlevania series of video games. It takes place over 5,000 years before Vampire Hunter D and focuses on expanding the history of the Nobility, following the exploits of the vampire warrior Lord Greylancer. In 2013, Viz Media's Haikasoru imprint released the first official English translation of the prequel series, retitled Noble V: Greylancer, translated by Takami Nieda with newly commissioned cover artwork by Vincent Chong. Adaptations =1985 animated film= Vampire Hunter D remains a cult classic among English-speaking audiences. Billed by the Japanese producers as a \\"dark future science-fiction romance\\" Vampire Hunter D is set in the year 12,090 AD, in a post-nuclear holocaust world where vampires, mutants and demons \\"slither through a world of darkness\\" (in the words of the film's opening introduction). =1988‚Äì1990 audio dramas= Asashi Sonorama created audio drama adaptations of three of the novels, in five parts: # Raiser of Gales \\"D\\" (January 1988) (the book it was based on was published May 1984) # D ‚Äì Demon Deathchase (June 1988) # D ‚Äì Mysterious Journey to the North Sea I: To the North Sea (March 1990) # D ‚Äì Mysterious Journey to the North Sea II: Summer at Last (May 1990) # D ‚Äì Mysterious Journey to the North Sea III: When Winter Comes Again (June 1990). Most of the voice cast for the original OVA reprised their roles. Originally released on cassette tape, in 2005 they were re- released as a special edition, five-disc Vampire Hunter D Audio Drama Box, including a small supplemental booklet with a new short story by Kikuchi and an \\"art cloth\\" with an illustration by Amano. =1999 video game= A video game based on Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust was also made for the PlayStation game console, titled Vampire Hunter D. It is a survival horror game, but also similar to a standard adventure title. The player can see D from different pre-rendered angles throughout the game, and allow D to attack enemies with his sword. D can also use magic, Left Hand's abilities, and items. The story of the game is similar to that of Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, although it takes place entirely within the castle as D fights all the enemies. Only two of the Barbarois mutants appear as enemies. There are 3 endings, 1 of which is similar to the end of the anime. =2000 animated film= The second film, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust garnered respect for its advanced animation techniques, detailed art style and character designs, voice acting originally recorded in English (English voice casting/direction by Jack Fletcher), and its sophisticated orchestral soundtrack composed, arranged and conducted by Marco D'Ambrosio. Its art style closely mirrored that of the illustrator and original character designer of the first movie, Yoshitaka Amano. The storyline features a larger cast than the first film. The second Vampire Hunter D movie (known as Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust outside of Japan) is based on the third of Hideyuki Kikuchi's Vampire Hunter D novels (Demon Deathchase in English). Unlike the first film, which was released in 1985, this movie is rated NC-16 in Singapore, M in Australia, 15 in the UK, R13 in New Zealand and R for violence/gore in the USA (except for the Blu-ray release, which is unrated).Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust on IMDb, The Internet Movie Database, September 26, 2008 =2007 manga adaptation= In November 2007, the first volume of Saiko Takaki's manga adaptation of Hideyuki Kikuchi's series was published simultaneously in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. The project, overseen by Digital Manga Publishing and Hideyuki Kikuchi, aimed to adapt the entire catalogue of Vampire Hunter D novels into a manga form, however it had concluded after the eighth volume =2016 comic book series= On June 30, 2016, a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for a five-issue Vampire Hunter D comic book series titled Vampire Hunter D: Message from Mars was announced. Published by Stranger Comics with supervision from series creator Hideyuki Kikuchi and support from the creative teams at Unified Pictures and Digital Frontier, Message from Mars is an adaptation of the 2005 short story Message from Cecile and acts as a prequel to the then-in-development animated series. The series is written by Brandon M. Easton and illustrated by Michael Broussard, with visual development by Christopher Shy. The campaign's stretch goals also include an official Vampire Hunter D Pathfinder Roleplaying Game supplement written by F. Wesley Schneider. The campaign reached its $25,000 funding goal on July 1, 2016 and its initial $50,000 stretch goal on July 7, 2016. The campaign concluded on August 9, 2016, with 1,736 backers pledging a total of $107,025, reaching four out of five stretch goals. Following the first issue the series was placed on temporary hiatus due to a serious medical emergency in Broussard's family, resuming production in early 2018 with new artists Ryan Benjamin and Richard Friend. =Upcoming animated series= In June 2015, a new CGI animated series tentatively titled Vampire Hunter D: Resurrection was announced, produced by Unified Pictures and Digital Frontier. The series would be produced by Kurt Rauer and Scott McLean, and directed by Yoichi Mori, with Bloodlust director Yoshiaki Kawajiri acting as supervising director and series creator Hideyuki Kikuchi providing editorial supervision. The series was currently in pre-production, and is developed as an hour-long serial drama with the intent of being broadcast on a major American cable network or on-demand provider, with Japanese distribution to follow. As of June 2016 the series is still in pre-production, with plans to begin shipping the project to distributors by the end of the year. Given the abundance of source material, the current plan is to produce as many as seven seasons, without revisiting the source material that was adapted into the first two films. In February 2018 it was announced that the pilot episode would be written by Brandon M. Easton, writer for the Message from Mars comic book series. The first draft of the pilot was completed in October 2018. =Other media= In July 2008, Devils Due Publishing announced that it had acquired the rights to publish an English-language Vampire Hunter D comic book mini- series titled Vampire Hunter D: American Wasteland, to be written by Jimmy Palmiotti and pencilled by Tim Seeley, however the project was cancelled in 2009.LBCC '09: Jimmy Palmiotti (Jonah Hex, Powergirl and More) ComicVine, October 6, 2009 Intended to infuse the standard Vampire Hunter D formula and mythos with more Western sensibilities, it would have told an original story about D departing the Frontier to embark on a journey to a new land still ruled by the vampiric Nobility.}} In 2010, it was reported in Japanese horror magazine Rue Morgue that Hideyuki Kikuchi was in talks with one of the producers for Capcom's Resident Evil video game series to develop a live- action Vampire Hunter D adaptation.'Vampire Hunter D' Live-Action Movie In The Works?

The term pulmonary circulation is readily paired and contrasted with the systemic circulation. The vessels of the pulmonary circulation are the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins. A separate system known as the bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.  Structure  3D rendering of a high resolution computed tomography of the thorax. The anterior thoracic wall, the airways and the pulmonary vessels anterior to the root of the lung have been digitally removed in order to visualize the different levels of the pulmonary circulation. Image showing main pulmonary artery coursing ventrally to the aortic root and trachea. The right pulmonary artery passes dorsally to the ascending aorta, while the left pulmonary artery passes ventrally to the descending aorta. Deoxygenated blood leaves the heart, goes to the lungs, and then re-enters the heart; Deoxygenated blood leaves through the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery. From the right atrium, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve (or right atrioventricular valve), into the right ventricle. Blood is then pumped from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve and into the main pulmonary artery. =Lungs= The pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is picked up during respiration. Arteries are further divided into very fine capillaries which are extremely thin-walled. The pulmonary vein returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart. =Veins= The oxygenated blood then leaves the lungs through pulmonary veins, which return it to the left part of the heart, completing the pulmonary cycle. This blood then enters the left atrium, which pumps it through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the blood passes through the aortic valve to the aorta. The blood is then distributed to the body through the systemic circulation before returning again to the pulmonary circulation. =Arteries= From the right ventricle, blood is pumped through the semilunar pulmonary valve into the left and right main pulmonary arteries (one for each lung), which branch into smaller pulmonary arteries that spread throughout the lungs. Development The pulmonary circulation loop is virtually bypassed in fetal circulation. The fetal lungs are collapsed, and blood passes from the right atrium directly into the left atrium through the foramen ovale: an open conduit between the paired atria, or through the ductus arteriosus: a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. When the lungs expand at birth, the pulmonary pressure drops and blood is drawn from the right atrium into the right ventricle and through the pulmonary circuit. Over the course of several months, the foramen ovale closes, leaving a shallow depression known as the fossa ovalis. Clinical significance A number of medical conditions can affect the pulmonary circulation. * Pulmonary hypertension describes an increase in resistance in the pulmonary arteries * Pulmonary embolus is a blood clot, usually from a deep vein thrombosis that has lodged in the pulmonary vasculature. It can cause difficulty breathing or chest pain, is usually diagnosed through a CT pulmonary angiography or V/Q scan, and is often treated with anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin. * Cardiac shunt is an unnatural connection between parts of the heart that leads to blood flow that bypasses the lungs. * Vascular resistance * Pulmonary shunt History The opening page of one of Ibn al-Nafis's medical works The discovery of pulmonary circulation has been attributed to several scientists over the years. In much of modern medical literature, the discovery is credited to English physician William Harvey (1578 - 1657 CE). Other sources credit Spanish physician Michael Servetus (c. 1509 - 1553 CE) and Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis (1213 - 1288 CE) with the discovery. However, earlier descriptions of the cardiovascular system are found in ancient cultures. The earliest known description of the role of air in circulation was produced in Egypt in 3500 BCE. At this time, Egyptians believed that the heart was the origin of many channels that connected different parts of the body and transported air as well as urine, blood, and the soul. The Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BCE), named for American Egyptologist Edwin Smith (1822 - 1906 CE) who purchased the scroll in 1862, provided evidence that Egyptians believed that the heartbeat created a pulse that transported the above substances throughout the body. A second scroll, the Ebers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE), also emphasized the importance of the heart and its connection to vessels throughout the body and described methods to detect cardiac disease through pulse abnormalities. However, despite their knowledge of the heartbeat, vessels, and pulse, the Egyptians attributed the movement of substances throughout the vessels to air that resided in these channels, rather than to the heart's force. The Egyptians knew that air played an important role in circulation, but they did not yet apparently have a concept for the precise role of the lungs. The next addition to the human understanding of pulmonary circulation came with the Ancient Greeks. The physician Alcmaeon (520 - 450 BCE) proposed that the brain, not the heart, was the connection point for all of the vessels in the body. He believed that the function of these vessels was to bring the spirit (pneuma) and air to the brain. Empedocles (492 - 432 BCE), a philosopher, proposed a series of pipes impermeable to blood but continuous with blood vessels which carried the pneuma throughout the body. He proposed that this spirit was internalized with pulmonary respiration. The physician Hippocrates (460 - 370 BCE) developed the view that the liver and spleen produced blood, which traveled to the heart to be cooled by the lungs that surrounded it. Hippocrates described the heart as having two ventricles connected by an interventricular septum. He depicted the heart as the connecting point for all the vessels of the body and proposed that some vessels carried only blood, while others also carried air. These air-carrying vessels were the pulmonary veins, which brought air to the left ventricle, and the pulmonary artery, which carried air to the right ventricle and blood to the lungs. He also proposed two atria of the heart that functioned to capture air. Hippocrates was one of the first to begin to accurately describe the anatomy of the heart and to describe the involvement of the lungs in circulation, but his descriptions of the process of pulmonary circulation and of the functions of the parts of the heart were still largely incorrect. Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle (384 - 322 BCE) followed Hippocrates and proposed that the heart had three ventricles, rather than two, that all connected to the lungs. The Greek physician Erasistratus (315 - 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was breathed into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins. It was transformed there into the pneuma and distributed throughout the body by arteries, which contained only air. In this system, veins distributed blood throughout the body, and this blood did not circulate, but rather was consumed by the organs. The Greek physician Galen (129 - c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were incorrect, his theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community for hundreds of years after his death. Galen contradicted Erasistratus before him by proposing that arteries carried both air and blood, rather than air alone. He proposed that the liver was the point of origin for all blood vessels and that the heart was not a pumping muscle, but rather an organ which blood passed through. Galen's theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation. In it, air was inhaled into the lungs where it became the pneuma. Pulmonary veins transmitted this pneuma to the left ventricle of the heart to cool the blood simultaneously arriving there. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced the vital spirits which could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen also proposed that the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors which were expelled through the same pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma. He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role than the left; it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be distributed throughout the body. Though Galen's description of the anatomy of the heart was more complete than those of his predecessors, it included several mistakes. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum. The next developments in the human understanding of pulmonary circulation did not come until centuries later. Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980 - 1037 CE) wrote a medical encyclopedia entitled The Canon of Medicine. In this book, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some new information of his own. However, Avicenna's description of pulmonary circulation reflected the incorrect views of Galen. The Arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon in 1242 in which he provided the first known accurate description of pulmonary circulation as it is known today. Ibn al-Nafis made two key improvements on Galen's ideas of pulmonary circulation. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed to allow blood flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he followed that the only way for blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was pulmonary circulation. He also described the anatomy of the lungs in clear, correct detail, which his predecessors had not. However, like Aristotle and Galen, al- Nafis still believed that the vital spirit was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air. Despite the enormity of Ibn al-Nafis's improvements on the theories of pulmonary circulation that preceded him, his commentary on The Canon was not widely known to Western scholars until the manuscript was discovered in Berlin, Germany, in 1924. As a result, Ibn al- Nafis was not widely credited with the discovery of pulmonary circulation in Western medical literature until recently. It took several hundred years for European scientists and physicians to reach the same conclusions that al-Nafis had. Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452 - 1519 CE) was one of the first to propose that the heart was just a muscle, rather than a vessel of spirits and air, but he ascribed to Galen's ideas of circulation and defended the existence of interventricular pores. The Flemish physician Andreas Vesalius (1514 - 1564 CE) published corrections to Galen's view of circulatory anatomy, questioning the existence of interventricular pores, in his book De humani corporis fabrica libri septem in 1543. Michael Servetus after him was the first European physician to accurately describe pulmonary circulation. His assertions matched those of al-Nafis, and though he has been frequently credited with making the discovery on his own, it is likely that he had access to Ibn al-Nafis's work while writing his own texts. Servetus published his findings in Christianismi Restituto (1553), a theological work that was considered \\"heretical\\" by Catholics and Calvinists alike, burned on the stake (along with its author) and barely survived in a few copies. Italian physician Realdo Colombo (c. 1515 - 1559 CE) published a book, De re anatomica libri XV, in 1559 that accurately described pulmonary circulation as well. It is still debated among historians as to whether or not Colombo reached his conclusions on his own or if he based his work on those of al-Nafis and Servetus. Finally, William Harvey provided the most complete and accurate description of pulmonary circulation of any of the European physicians in his treatise Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus in 1628.

In September 2004, BOC had over 30,000 employees on six continents, with sales of over ¬£10.6 billion.BOC Report and Accounts 2005 BOC was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and the FT 30. On 5 September 2006 the BOC Group became part of the Linde Group of Germany.  History  =Early years as Brin's Oxygen Company (1886‚Äì1905)= Brin's Oxygen Company, Ltd. was formed in 1886, by two French brothers, Arthur and Leon Brin. In the early years, the company manufactured oxygen using a high temperature barium oxide process, known as the Brin process, developed from the work of French scientist Jean Baptiste Boussingault. The main application for gaseous oxygen at that time was in connection with generation of limelight, used in magic lanterns and theatre lighting. A major new market emerged around 1903, with the development of the oxyacetylene welding process. Around the same time, new cryogenic air separation processes had been devised independently in Britain, the United States and Germany. The German engineer and founder of the Linde Group, Carl von Linde, won the patent for the process. The Brin brothers negotiated an agreement to use the Linde patents. In exchange, Carl von Linde was given a stake and a board position in Brin's Oxygen Company, which he held until 1914. The new process replaced the inefficient barium oxide process, paving the way for larger scale and more efficient production. =As BOC and expansion (1906‚Äì1978)= In 1906, the Brin brothers renamed the company the British Oxygen Company or BOC. During the First World War, the business increased significantly as the mass production of needed war machinery‚Äîships, tanks and trucks‚Äîinvolved either metal cutting or welding. In the post-war period, it grew by acquisitions, which included Sparklets Ltd, Allen-Liversidge Ltd and the Quasi-Arc Company. During the Second World War, the gases for munitions and for medical needs were provided by BOC. As in the First World War, the business grew. After the war, BOC formed subsidiaries in over twenty countries. In the 1950s, due to the increased demand for automobiles, improved methods of manufacturing steel were invented which required \\"tonnage\\" oxygen. This meant further increase in business for BOC. BOC diversified into many industries in the 1960s and '70s. One was refrigeration market and it set up a joint venture called BOC-Linde Refrigeration Ltd.', with Linde AG of Germany in 1968. It also acquired Ace Refrigeration Ltd and J. Muirhead Ltd, quick frozen food suppliers, in 1969. With the plan of expanding into the Far East, it set up British Oxygen (Far East) Ltd, based in Tokyo. It established subsidiaries and joint ventures in Jamaica, the Netherlands, South Africa, Sweden and Spain for a number of products; which included transformers, magnetising equipment, frozen foods, stable isotopes, radioactively labelled compounds and cryogenic systems. In 1971, the company installed the largest mainframe computer in Britain, linking a network of computers throughout the country, and sold computer time to outside customers. As a result, BOC diversified into the computer business. The 1973 oil crisis led to a rethinking of BOC's future strategy. It divested non-strategic assets; and concentrated on its primary business, especially the gases and health care markets, and the expansion of these businesses to Europe, the Americas and the Far East. In 1975, the company officially became 'BOC International Ltd', reflecting its success in developing business outside of Britain, and in products beyond oxygen. =BOC Group (1978‚Äì2006)= An important part of BOC's history was the acquisition of Airco Industrial Gases, an American competitor. After 11 years of litigation, in 1978 Airco became a wholly owned subsidiary of BOC. The enlarged company changed its name to the BOC Group. In 1999, reports emerged that the US Industrial gases company Praxair - a 1992 spun off from Linde AG's US division, 'Union Carbide Industrial Gases' \\\\- were in possible merger discussions with BOC Group. Following the breakup of the talks, France's L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Products & Chemicals Inc. made a series of cash offers to acquire the group.BOC rejects takeover bid On 13 July 1999, the BOC board approved a pre-conditional cash offer of ¬£14.60 per share. The BOC Group's assets were to be divided between Air Liquide and Air Products in the US$11 billion deal.Balloon goes up on BOC independence On 12 May 2000, the bid lapsed, following failure to reach a satisfactory agreement with the United States Federal Trade Commission.BOC merger collapses Following the collapse of the bid, BOC Group developed a new strategy to stimulate business growth in new products and markets, and to reshape its existing portfolio of businesses to improve Group performance. In 2001, BOC Group announced it was cutting 1,500 jobs. In late 2002, the company merged its Japanese industrial and medical gas businesses with those of Air Liquide to form Japan Air Gases. BOC also acquired Praxair's operations in Poland. In November 2003, BOC Group announced that it would complete the sale of Afrox Healthcare - a hospital and managed health care group operating in South Africa - to a consortium led by Black Economic Empowerment investors.BOC sells South African Hospital stake =Part of the Linde Group (2006‚Äìpresent)= The BOC Group's total revenues in 2005, including its share of joint ventures and associate companies, were ¬£4.6 billion and was then the second largest industrial gas supplier in the world. Industrial gases business made up for more than 80% of sales. The group was getting nearly one-third of its revenues from Asia Pacific; Europe accounted for 28% and the Americas 27%. In January 2006, the Linde Group made a preliminary proposal to acquire BOC Group based in a ¬£15 per share all-cash offer, which was rejected by the BOC board of directors. In March 2006, the second proposal based on a ¬£16 per share all-cash offer, valuing the company at ¬£8.2bn (US$14.4bn; ‚Ç¨12bn), was accepted and takeover was completed on 5 September 2006.Statement on Linde homepage After nearly a century of intermittent courtship, BOC became a part of Linde Group and the synergy overtook Air Liquide as the global market leader. On 6 September, BOC Group employees received a welcome pack including a letter from Linde CEO Professor Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle, a small badge representing the new logo of 'The Linde Group' and a Swatch watch. Many of these watches quickly appeared on eBay. On 12 March 2007, the Linde Group divested the vacuum business known as BOC Edwards to the private investment group 'CCMP Capital'. Operations The BOC Group business activities included: *The Process Gas Solutions (PGS) line of business, supplying large product volumes by pipeline, on-site generation or cryogenic tanker. *The Industrial and Special Products (ISP) line of business providing packaged gas, chemicals and related products and services. The gases involved are typically delivered in high pressure cylinders and range from technical grades to high purity specialty gases. *BOC Edwards supplying the semiconductor industry with vacuum, chemical delivery and abatement systems and related services. It also supplies vacuum equipment to many industrial and scientific sectors. *Gist Limited provides logistics solutions, transport and warehousing to a number of sectors including food, beverage and fashion retail for large corporations including Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Tesco. Headquarters When BOC was a global company, the head office of BOC was in Windlesham, a small village approximately 25 miles south west of London. The office, built in the 1980s is a fine example of modern architecture and when seen from the air resembles the shape of an oxygen molecule. Today, this office stands empty and has now been sold. Many of the staff that were based in the Windlesham office have since moved to the BOC office in Guildford and Linde plc's head office in Munich, Germany.

The village is part of Stratford-on-Avon district, and in the 2001 census it had a population of 2,278, increasing to 2,337 at the 2011 Census. Kineton is about ten miles (16 km) from the towns of Banbury to the south-east, Warwick and Leamington Spa to the north, and Stratford-upon- Avon to the west. Nearby is the village of Wellesbourne with its historic water mill, Compton Verney House art gallery, the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, the Burton Dassett Hills country park and the battlefield of Edgehill. Kineton, in the district historically known as the Vale of the Red Horse, can also be considered to be part of the informal area of Banburyshire. Kineton district council ward covers Gaydon, Lighthorne, Lighthorne Heath, Compton Verney, Combrook, Little Kineton and Chadshunt, a population of 4,228 according to the 2001 census, rising to 4,320 at the 2011 census. The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural; many residents commute to nearby towns and cities for employment. History King John's Castle The first recorded reference to Kineton was in 969, when Saxon King Edgar granted some land here to a trusted counsellor. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Kington. On the outskirts of the village, at the foot of Pittern Hill, are the remains of the earthworks of a motte-and-bailey castle, known as King John's Castle, so called because it is believed that King John held a Court Leet there. Kineton gave its name to the area of south- east Warwickshire known as Kineton Hundred.Allen, Geoff (2000). Warwickshire Towns & Villages, Watford, Hertfordshire: Sigma Leisure Ltd. Early in the 13th century, Stephen de Segrave had a Tuesday market in his manor of Kineton, and a fair on the eve and day of St Peter and St Paul. The market died out by 1840, when the market house was pulled down and a school built on its site, but the fair on 5 February continued until recently. For a period of the English Civil War, Kineton was looted by Prince Rupert with part of the Royalist army. This was after he had defeated Sir James Ramsay, from the Parliamentarians, and by doing this he failed to aid the rest of his army, thus leading to a neutral ending to the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. A year later, in July 1643, King Charles met with Queen Henrietta Maria at Kineton. John Newton who lived from 1725 to 1807 and for a while lived in the village of Kineton where he wrote the words to \\"Amazing Grace\\" in 1772 William Kendall, co-builder of Birmingham Town Hall and subsequent Warwick County Surveyor and Steward to the Earl of Warwick, lived in Little Kineton in 1841.Harris, Penelope, \\"The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882): Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall, and Churches of the Catholic Revival\\", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, pp.73,74 ; 1841 census. Military connections During World War II, Kineton served as a transit camp, with Polish and Czechoslovakian troops stationed there. One of the UK's main military ammunition depots is located partially within Kineton parish, and is known as the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA), Kineton.http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceFor/ServiceCommunity/Hive/Central/KinetonHive.htm It extends to several hundred acres and is linked to the main Network Rail system by a branch line. The depot also stores spare railway carriages and trains on behalf of the various UK Train Operating companies. Partially within Kineton parish, from 1942 until 1977, RAF Gaydon operated as both a training unit and a front-line bomber base. In 1978, the site passed into civilian ownership and today contains the British Motor Museum, the headquarters and factory of sports car manufacturer Aston Martin, and the Jaguar Land Rover Gaydon Centre. Present St Peter's Church, Kineton Near the centre of the village stands St Peter's Church. Work on the current building, which replaced an earlier church on the same site, began in the 13th century. A completed church was consecrated in 1315. Of this new building only the fine tower remains. The rest of the building has been rebuilt and remodelled over the centuries. In the 18th century Sanderson Miller enlarged the nave and added two transepts. A further remodelling campaign, which transformed the building into its current form, took place in the 19th century. Pittern Hill Windmill In 2008, three new bells were cast to augment the bells to eight, one replacing an existing bell. Taylors Eayre & Smith Ltd of Loughborough carried out the work. The eight bells were rung for the first time on 5 November 2008. The village also has a 19th-century Methodist chapel and a 20th-century Roman Catholic church. Pittern Hill Mill, north-west of the village, is a stone windmill of the 18th century. Village shops include a Co-op store, a traditional butcher, a newsagent, a flower shop, an optician, and the Nifty Needle curtain and soft furnishings/fabrics shop and workroom. There is a post office/convenience store and had a branch of HSBC Bank now converted into a pharmacy (2017). The village has a veterinary practice, a caf√©, a fish and chip shop, two public houses, \\"The Swan\\", newly refurbished, and The Carpenters Arms (which has a Chinese take-away inside) and a restaurant, Shukur's Brasserie (which offers Bangladeshi and Indian cuisine). The village and surrounding area are served by Kineton Church of England Primary School and Kineton High School, which takes students aged 11‚Äì19. Transport Kineton is close to the Fosse Way Roman Road and the M40 motorway which links it to Birmingham and London. Regular bus services to Stratford upon Avon, Banbury and Leamington Spa are operated by Stagecoach and other independent companies. The village was once served by the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway between Stratford-upon-Avon and Towcester. Kineton railway station opened on 1 June 1871 and was situated on the Broom to Fenny Compton line. The station closed in 1963 due to the Beeching Axe and the line itself closed two years later. Sports Kineton Sports and Social Club hosts football, cricket and bowls teams. The football team competes in the Leamington & District Sunday Football League, affiliated to the Birmingham FA and the cricket side competes in the Cotswold Hills League. Kinetonbcycle are a group cycling from Little Kineton at 19:15 on Wednesday nights covering around 25 miles with on and off-road routes and including a pub stop. Kineton Hign School is the home of Wellesbourne Badminton Club who play in the Leamington and Banbury Leagues and have a club night every Tuesday from 7.30 pm, and South Warwickshire Junior Badminton Club who are a Badminton England Affiliated Club playing on a Friday night at 6.30 pm.

In the Russian Empire, they were called Ostyaks, without differentiating them from several other Siberian peoples. Later they became known as Yenisey ostyaks, because they lived in the middle and lower basin of the Yenisei River in the Krasnoyarsk Krai district of Russia. The modern Kets lived along the eastern middle stretch of the river before being assimilated politically into Russia between the 17th and 19th centuries. According to the 2010 census, there were 1,220 Kets in Russia. History The Ket are thought to be the only survivors of an ancient nomadic people believed to have originally lived throughout central and southern Siberia. In the 1960s the Yugh people were distinguished as a separate, though similar, group. Today's Kets are the descendants of the tribes of fishermen and hunters of the Yenisei taiga, who adopted some of the cultural ways of those original Ket-speaking tribes of South Siberia. The earlier tribes engaged in hunting, fishing, and even reindeer breeding in the northern areas. The Ket were incorporated into the Russian state in the 17th century. Their efforts to resist were futile as the Russians deported them to different places to break up their resistance. This also broke up their strictly organized patriarchal social system and their way of life disintegrated. The Ket people ran up huge debts with the Russians. Some died of famine, others of diseases introduced from Europe. By the 19th century, the Kets could no longer survive without food support from the Russian state. In the 20th century, the Soviets forced collectivization upon the Ket. They were officially recognized as Kets in the 1930s when the Soviet Union started to implement the self-definition policy with respect to indigenous peoples. However, Ket traditions continued to be suppressed and self-initiative was discouraged. Collectivization was completed by the 1950s and the Russian lifestyle and language forced upon the Ket people. The population of Kets has been relatively stable since 1923. According to the 2002 census, there were 1,494 Kets in Russia. This compares with 1,200 in the 1970 census. Today the Ket live in small villages along riversides and are no longer nomadic. Language The Ket language has been linked to the Na-Den√© languages of North America in the Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian language family. This link has led to some collaboration between the Ket and some northern Athabaskan peoples. Ket means \\"man\\" (plural deng \\"men, people\\"). The Kets of the Kas, Sym and Dubches rivers use jugun as a self-designation. In 1788 Peter Simon Pallas was the earliest scholar to publish observations about the Ket language in a travel diary. In 1926, there were 1,428 Kets, of whom 1,225 (85.8%) were native speakers of the Ket language. The 1989 census counted 1,113 ethnic Kets with only 537 (48.3%) native speakers left. As of 2008, there were only about 100 people who still spoke Ket fluently, half of them over 50. It is entirely different from any other language in Siberia. Alexander Kotusov (1955‚Äì2019) was a Ket folk singer, composer and writer of songs in the Ket language.Siberian Lang ‚Äì Alexander Maksimovich Kotusov Culture The Ket traditional culture was researched by Matthias Castr√©n, Vasiliy Ivanovich Anuchin, Kai Donner, Hans Findeisen, and Yevgeniya Alekseyevna Alekseyenko.Hopp√°l 2005: 170‚Äì171 Shamanism was a living practice into the 1930s, but by the 1960s almost no authentic shamans could be found. Shamanism is not a homogeneous phenomenon, nor is shamanism in Siberia. As for shamanism among Kets, it shared characteristics with those of Turkic and Mongolic peoples.Hopp√°l 2005: 172 Additionally, there were several types of Ket shamans,Alekseyenko 1978Hopp√°l 2005: 171 differing in function (sacral rites, curing), power, and associated animals (deer, bear). Also, among Kets (as with several other Siberian peoples such as the KaragasDi√≥szegi 1960: 128, 188, 243Di√≥szegi 1960: 130Hopp√°l 1994: 75) there are examples of the use of skeleton symbolics. Hopp√°l interprets this as a symbol of shamanic rebirth,Hopp√°l 1994: 65 although it may symbolize also the bones of the loon (the helper animal of the shaman, joining the air and underwater worlds, just like the story of the shaman who travelled both to the sky and the underworld).Hopp√°l 2005: 198 The skeleton-like overlay represented shamanic rebirth among some other Siberian cultures as well.Hopp√°l 2005: 199 Of great importance to Kets are dolls, described as \\"an animal shoulder bone wrapped in a scrap of cloth simulating clothing.\\"A. A. Malygna, Dolls of the Peoples of Siberia 1988, p. 132, cited in Edward J. Vajda, Yeniseian Peoples and Languages: A History of Yeniseian Studies with an annotated bibliography and a source guide, Curzon Press, 2001. One adult Ket, who had been careless with a cigarette, said, \\"It's a shame I don't have my doll. My house burnt down together with my dolls.\\"Werner Herzog, Happy People: A Year in the Taiga (documentary film) 2010. Kets regard their dolls as household deities, which sleep in the daytime and protect them at night.Herzog Vajda spent a year in Siberia studying the Ket people, and finds a relationship between the Ket language and the Na-Dene languages, of which Navajo is the most prominent and widely spoken. Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov compared Ket mythology with that of Uralic peoples, assuming in the studies that they are modelling semiotic systems in the compared mythologies. They have also made typological comparisons.Ivanov & Toporov 1973Ivanov 1984:390, in editorial afterword by Hopp√°l Among other comparisons, possibly from Uralic mythological analogies, the mythologies of Ob-Ugric peoplesIvanov 1984: 225, 227, 229 and Samoyedic peoplesIvanov 1984: 229, 230 are mentioned. Other authors have discussed analogies (similar folklore motifs, purely typological considerations, and certain binary pairs in symbolics) may be related to a dualistic organization of society‚Äîsome dualistic features can be found in comparisons with these peoples.Ivanov 1984: 229‚Äì231 However, for Kets, neither dualistic organization of societyZolotaryov 1980: 39 nor cosmological dualismZolotaryov 1980: 48 have been researched thoroughly. If such features existed at all, they have either weakened or remained largely undiscovered. There are some reports of a division into two exogamous patrilinear moieties,Zolotaryov 1980: 37 folklore on conflicts of mythological figures, and cooperation of two beings in the creation of the land, the motif of the earth-diver.Ivanov 1984: 229 This motif is present in several cultures in different variants. In one example, the creator of the world is helped by a waterfowl as the bird dives under the water and fetches earth so that the creator can make land out of it. In some cultures, the creator and the earth- fetching being (sometimes called a devil, or taking the shape of a loon) compete with one another; in other cultures (including the Ket variant), they do not compete at all, but rather collaborate.Paulson 1975 :295 However, if dualistic cosmologies are defined in a broad sense, and not restricted to certain concrete motifs, then their existence is more widespread; they exist not only among some Uralic peoples, but in examples on every inhabited continent.Zolotarjov 1980: 56  Origin  The Ket people share their origin with other Yeniseian people. They are closely related to other Siberians, East Asians and Indigenous peoples of the Americas. They are a Mongoloid population and belong mostly exclusive to yDNA haplogroup Q-M242. According to a recent study, the Ket and other Yeniseian people originated likely somewhere near the Altai Mountains or near Lake Baikal. Many Yeniseians were assimilated into the modern Turkic people. It is suggested that the Altaians are predominantly of Yeniseian origin and closely related to the Ket people. Other Siberian Turkic groups have also greatly assimilated Yeniseian people. The Ket people are also closely related to several Native American groups. According to this study, the Yeniseians are linked to Paleo-Eskimo groups. File:No-nb bldsa 3f081.jpgKet woman, 1913 File:No-nb bldsa 3f077.jpgKet women and children, 1913 File:No-nb bldsa 3f078.

The common name of this bird commemorates the British naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard; his first wife, Barbara Anne Calthrop, whom he married in 1845, is commemorated in the specific epithet. Description left Layard's parakeet is a green parrot, 29 cm long including a tail up to 13 cm. The adult has a bluish-grey head and back, separated by a green collar. There is a broad black chin stripe and the tail is blue tipped yellow. The upper mandible of the male's bill is red and the lower mandible is brown. The female is similar, but has an all black beak and less green on the face than the male. Immature birds are mainly green, with an orange bill.Forshaw (2006). plate 39. Behaviour Layard's parakeet is a bird of forests, particularly at the edges and in clearings, and also gardens. It is locally common. It undergoes local movements, driven mainly by the availability of the fruit, seeds, buds and blossoms that make up its diet. It is less gregarious than some of its relatives, and is usually in small groups outside the breeding season, when it often feeds with brahminy starlings. Its flight is swift and direct, and the call is a raucous chattering. It nests in holes in large trees, laying 3‚Äì4 white eggs.

Zootaxa 3404: 1‚Äì52. (Correlophus sarasinorum, new combination). also called commonly Roux's giant gecko, Sarasins' giant gecko, Sarasin's [sic] giant gecko (incorrectly), and the suras gecko, is a species of lizard in the family Diplodactylidae. The species is native to the southern portions of the outlying New Caledonian island of Grande Terre. Etymology The specific name, sarasinorum (masculine, genitive, plural), is in honor of Swiss zoologists Karl Friedrich Sarasin and Paul Benedict Sarasin, who were cousins.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Rhacodactylus sarasinorum, p. 233). Conservation status C. sarasinorum is currently being evaluated by CITES for protective status and is considered vulnerable to extinction in many herpetological circles. It has been found only in six locales in its native habitat. Description Since there is a considerable variation in snout-to-vent length (SVL) of C. sarasinorum, which ranges from 3.5 to 5.5 inches (9 to 14 centimeters), it has been suggested that more than one subspecies exists; there is no universal consensus on this point. The basic color of the suras gecko is brown to gray. Two color patterns exist. A white spotted version is the recessive trait, and a white \\"V\\" pattern is the dominant trait. The gecko's appearance has often been described as similar to a large Correlophus ciliatus, with larger eyes. Habitat The preferred natural habitats of C. sarasinorum are forest and shrubland, at altitudes of . Behavior C. sarasinorum is nocturnal, and less arboreal than the other Rhacodactylus (sensu lato) geckos. It is often found hiding under the leaf litter or under loose bark. This species has an animal instinct of sleeping on top of plants or in small trees face up preventing the common FTS (Floppy Tail Syndrome) caused by the gecko sleeping upside down. Diet C. sarasinorum is an omnivore and is also considered to be frugiverous. In the wild it eats insects and fruit. Reproduction The female C. sarasinorum lays two eggs which are buried in a soft, damp substrate. The eggs hatch 60‚Äì90 days after being laid. In captivity The species C. sarasinorum is sometimes seen in captivity. A pair may be kept in a 20-gallon (76-liter) \\"high\\" terrarium.

Born Islwyn Ffoulkes Ellis in Wrexham and raised in Glyn Ceiriog, Elis was educated at the University of Wales colleges of Bangor and Aberystwyth. During World War II he was a conscientious objector and he began writing poetry and prose, winning the prose medal at the 1951 National Eisteddfod. He became a Presbyterian minister in 1950, and his first pastorate was at Moreia Chapel in Llanfair Caereinion. He translated the Gospel of Matthew into Welsh as Efengyl Mathew - trosiad i gymraeg diweddar, which was published in Caernarfon in 1961. He made his debut as a novelist in 1953 with Cysgod y Cryman (translated into English as Shadow of the Sickle), which would, in 1999, be chosen as the most significant Welsh language book of the 20th century. As a novelist Elis showed a great willingness to try out different forms, including popular ones. Cysgod y Cryman was followed by a study of intellectual decadence, Ffenestri tua'r Gwyll (Windows to the Dusk 1955). Yn √¥l i Leifior (1956; translated into English as Return to Lleifior) was a sequel to Cysgod y Cryman both set at the fictitious farming location Lleifior. In 1957, the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru published his time- travel story Wythnos yng Nghymru Fydd (A Week in Future Wales), presenting an independent, utopian Wales and a dystopian \\"Western England\\" in alternative versions of 2033. Blas y Cynfyd (A Taste of Prehistory 1958) was followed by the colonial satire Tabyrddau'r Babongo (Drums of the Babongo 1961). He thus pioneered the use of genres unfamiliar to Welsh-speaking readers, provided them with a highly readable prose often set in contemporary settings, and did much to establish the position of the novel as a major genre in Welsh-language literature. For periods he set out to live off his writing, something hardly attempted before in modern Welsh. Later works included Y Blaned Dirion (The Meek Planet 1968, another science fiction novel), Y Gromlech yn yr Haidd (The Dolmen in the Barley, 1971) and Eira Mawr (Great Snow, 1972). He also wrote a play, pamphlets, hundreds of articles and short stories as well as editing, with Gwyn Jones, Welsh Short Stories for the Oxford University Press (1956). His work has appeared in English, German, Italian and Irish translation. He was lecturer and reader at the University of Wales, Lampeter between 1975 and 1988. From his schooldays to the mid-1970s, Elis devoted a vast amount of time to politics. He ran as Plaid Cymru's candidate in Montgomeryshire in the 1959 and 1964 general elections and in a 1962 byelection. The so-called \\"Elvis Rock\\" graffito beside the A44 road in Ceredigion was originally written with the word \\"Elis\\" by two of his supporters in the 1962 by-election, and subsequently altered to read \\"Elvis\\". In retirement, he received a DLitt from the University of Wales. In 1999 a biography of Elis by T Robin Chapman, published in both Welsh and in English, appeared.

Geometric, algebraic, and arithmetic objects are assigned objects called K-groups. These are groups in the sense of abstract algebra. They contain detailed information about the original object but are notoriously difficult to compute; for example, an important outstanding problem is to compute the K-groups of the integers. K-theory was invented in the late 1950s by Alexander Grothendieck in his study of intersection theory on algebraic varieties. In the modern language, Grothendieck defined only K0, the zeroth K-group, but even this single group has plenty of applications, such as the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. Intersection theory is still a motivating force in the development of (higher) algebraic K-theory through its links with motivic cohomology and specifically Chow groups. The subject also includes classical number-theoretic topics like quadratic reciprocity and embeddings of number fields into the real numbers and complex numbers, as well as more modern concerns like the construction of higher regulators and special values of L-functions. The lower K-groups were discovered first, in the sense that adequate descriptions of these groups in terms of other algebraic structures were found. For example, if F is a field, then is isomorphic to the integers Z and is closely related to the notion of vector space dimension. For a commutative ring R, the group is related to the Picard group of R, and when R is the ring of integers in a number field, this generalizes the classical construction of the class group. The group K1(R) is closely related to the group of units , and if R is a field, it is exactly the group of units. For a number field F, the group K2(F) is related to class field theory, the Hilbert symbol, and the solvability of quadratic equations over completions. In contrast, finding the correct definition of the higher K-groups of rings was a difficult achievement of Daniel Quillen, and many of the basic facts about the higher K-groups of algebraic varieties were not known until the work of Robert Thomason.  History  The history of K-theory was detailed by Charles Weibel.Weibel 1999 = The Grothendieck group K0 = In the 19th century, Bernhard Riemann and his student Gustav Roch proved what is now known as the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. If X is a Riemann surface, then the sets of meromorphic functions and meromorphic differential forms on X form vector spaces. A line bundle on X determines subspaces of these vector spaces, and if X is projective, then these subspaces are finite dimensional. The Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem states that the difference in dimensions between these subspaces is equal to the degree of the line bundle (a measure of twistedness) plus one minus the genus of X. In the mid-20th century, the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem was generalized by Friedrich Hirzebruch to all algebraic varieties. In Hirzebruch's formulation, the Hirzebruch‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, the theorem became a statement about Euler characteristics: The Euler characteristic of a vector bundle on an algebraic variety (which is the alternating sum of the dimensions of its cohomology groups) equals the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle plus a correction factor coming from characteristic classes of the vector bundle. This is a generalization because on a projective Riemann surface, the Euler characteristic of a line bundle equals the difference in dimensions mentioned previously, the Euler characteristic of the trivial bundle is one minus the genus, and the only nontrivial characteristic class is the degree. The subject of K-theory takes its name from a 1957 construction of Alexander Grothendieck which appeared in the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, his generalization of Hirzebruch's theorem.Grothendieck 1957, Borel‚ÄìSerre 1958 Let X be a smooth algebraic variety. To each vector bundle on X, Grothendieck associates an invariant, its class. The set of all classes on X was called K(X) from the German Klasse. By definition, K(X) is a quotient of the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of vector bundles on X, and so it is an abelian group. If the basis element corresponding to a vector bundle V is denoted [V], then for each short exact sequence of vector bundles: :0 \\\\to V' \\\\to V \\\\to V \\\\to 0, Grothendieck imposed the relation . These generators and relations define K(X), and they imply that it is the universal way to assign invariants to vector bundles in a way compatible with exact sequences. Grothendieck took the perspective that the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem is a statement about morphisms of varieties, not the varieties themselves. He proved that there is a homomorphism from K(X) to the Chow groups of X coming from the Chern character and Todd class of X. Additionally, he proved that a proper morphism to a smooth variety Y determines a homomorphism called the pushforward. This gives two ways of determining an element in the Chow group of Y from a vector bundle on X: Starting from X, one can first compute the pushforward in K-theory and then apply the Chern character and Todd class of Y, or one can first apply the Chern character and Todd class of X and then compute the pushforward for Chow groups. The Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem says that these are equal. When Y is a point, a vector bundle is a vector space, the class of a vector space is its dimension, and the Grothendieck‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem specializes to Hirzebruch's theorem. The group K(X) is now known as K0(X). Upon replacing vector bundles by projective modules, K0 also became defined for non-commutative rings, where it had applications to group representations. Atiyah and Hirzebruch quickly transported Grothendieck's construction to topology and used it to define topological K-theory.Atiyah‚ÄìHirzebruch 1961 Topological K-theory was one of the first examples of an extraordinary cohomology theory: It associates to each topological space X (satisfying some mild technical constraints) a sequence of groups Kn(X) which satisfy all the Eilenberg‚ÄìSteenrod axioms except the normalization axiom. The setting of algebraic varieties, however, is much more rigid, and the flexible constructions used in topology were not available. While the group K0 seemed to satisfy the necessary properties to be the beginning of a cohomology theory of algebraic varieties and of non- commutative rings, there was no clear definition of the higher Kn(X). Even as such definitions were developed, technical issues surrounding restriction and gluing usually forced Kn to be defined only for rings, not for varieties. = K0, K1, and K2 = While it was not initially known, a group related to K1 had already been introduced in another context. Henri Poincar√© had attempted to define the Betti numbers of a manifold in terms of a triangulation. His methods, however, had a serious gap: Poincar√© could not prove that two triangulations of a manifold always yielded the same Betti numbers. It was clearly true that Betti numbers were unchanged by subdividing the triangulation, and therefore it was clear that any two triangulations that shared a common subdivision had the same Betti numbers. What was not known was that any two triangulations admitted a common subdivision. This hypothesis became a conjecture known as the Hauptvermutung (roughly \\"main conjecture\\"). The fact that triangulations were stable under subdivision led J.H.C. Whitehead to introduce the notion of simple homotopy type.Whitehead 1939, Whitehead 1941, Whitehead 1950 A simple homotopy equivalence is defined in terms of adding simplices or cells to a simplicial complex or cell complex in such a way that each additional simplex or cell deformation retracts into a subdivision of the old space. Part of the motivation for this definition is that a subdivision of a triangulation is simple homotopy equivalent to the original triangulation, and therefore two triangulations that share a common subdivision must be simple homotopy equivalent. Whitehead proved that simple homotopy equivalence is a finer invariant than homotopy equivalence by introducing an invariant called the torsion. The torsion of a homotopy equivalence takes values in a group now called the Whitehead group and denoted Wh(œÄ), where œÄ is the fundamental group of the two complexes. Whitehead found examples of non-trivial torsion and thereby proved that some homotopy equivalences were not simple. The Whitehead group was later discovered to be a quotient of K1(ZœÄ), where ZœÄ is the integral group ring of œÄ. Later John Milnor used Reidemeister torsion, an invariant related to Whitehead torsion, to disprove the Hauptvermutung. The first adequate definition of K1 of a ring was made by Hyman Bass and Stephen Schanuel.Bass‚ÄìSchanuel 1962 In topological K-theory, K1 is defined using vector bundles on a suspension of the space. All such vector bundles come from the clutching construction, where two trivial vector bundles on two halves of a space are glued along a common strip of the space. This gluing data is expressed using the general linear group, but elements of that group coming from elementary matrices (matrices corresponding to elementary row or column operations) define equivalent gluings. Motivated by this, the Bass‚ÄìSchanuel definition of K1 of a ring R is , where GL(R) is the infinite general linear group (the union of all GLn(R)) and E(R) is the subgroup of elementary matrices. They also provided a definition of K0 of a homomorphism of rings and proved that K0 and K1 could be fit together into an exact sequence similar to the relative homology exact sequence. Work in K-theory from this period culminated in Bass' book Algebraic K-theory.Bass 1968 In addition to providing a coherent exposition of the results then known, Bass improved many of the statements of the theorems. Of particular note is that Bass, building on his earlier work with Murthy,Bass‚ÄìMurthy 1967 provided the first proof of what is now known as the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory. This is a four-term exact sequence relating K0 of a ring R to K1 of R, the polynomial ring R[t], and the localization R[t, t‚àí1]. Bass recognized that this theorem provided a description of K0 entirely in terms of K1. By applying this description recursively, he produced negative K-groups K‚àín(R). In independent work, Max Karoubi gave another definition of negative K-groups for certain categories and proved that his definitions yielded that same groups as those of Bass.Karoubi 1968 The next major development in the subject came with the definition of K2. Steinberg studied the universal central extensions of a Chevalley group over a field and gave an explicit presentation of this group in terms of generators and relations.Steinberg 1962 In the case of the group En(k) of elementary matrices, the universal central extension is now written Stn(k) and called the Steinberg group. In the spring of 1967, John Milnor defined K2(R) to be the kernel of the homomorphism .Milnor 1971 The group K2 further extended some of the exact sequences known for K1 and K0, and it had striking applications to number theory. Hideya Matsumoto's 1968 thesisMatsumoto 1969 showed that for a field F, K2(F) was isomorphic to: :F^\\\\times \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf{Z}} F^\\\\times / \\\\langle x \\\\otimes (1 - x) \\\\colon x \\\\in F \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\} \\\\rangle. This relation is also satisfied by the Hilbert symbol, which expresses the solvability of quadratic equations over local fields. In particular, John Tate was able to prove that K2(Q) is essentially structured around the law of quadratic reciprocity. = Higher K-groups = In the late 1960s and early 1970s, several definitions of higher K-theory were proposed. SwanSwan 1968 and GerstenGersten 1969 both produced definitions of Kn for all n, and Gersten proved that his and Swan's theories were equivalent, but the two theories were not known to satisfy all the expected properties. Nobile and Villamayor also proposed a definition of higher K-groups.Nobile‚ÄìVillamayor 1968 Karoubi and Villamayor defined well- behaved K-groups for all n,Karoubi‚ÄìVillamayor 1971 but their equivalent of K1 was sometimes a proper quotient of the Bass‚ÄìSchanuel K1. Their K-groups are now called KVn and are related to homotopy-invariant modifications of K-theory. Inspired in part by Matsumoto's theorem, Milnor made a definition of the higher K-groups of a field.Milnor 1970 He referred to his definition as \\"purely ad hoc\\",Milnor 1970, p. 319 and it neither appeared to generalize to all rings nor did it appear to be the correct definition of the higher K-theory of fields. Much later, it was discovered by Nesterenko and SuslinNesterenko‚ÄìSuslin 1990 and by TotaroTotaro 1992 that Milnor K-theory is actually a direct summand of the true K-theory of the field. Specifically, K-groups have a filtration called the weight filtration, and the Milnor K-theory of a field is the highest weight-graded piece of the K-theory. Additionally, Thomason discovered that there is no analog of Milnor K-theory for a general variety.Thomason 1992 The first definition of higher K-theory to be widely accepted was Daniel Quillen's.Quillen 1971 As part of Quillen's work on the Adams conjecture in topology, he had constructed maps from the classifying spaces BGL(Fq) to the homotopy fiber of , where œàq is the qth Adams operation acting on the classifying space BU. This map is acyclic, and after modifying BGL(Fq) slightly to produce a new space BGL(Fq)+, the map became a homotopy equivalence. This modification was called the plus construction. The Adams operations had been known to be related to Chern classes and to K-theory since the work of Grothendieck, and so Quillen was led to define the K-theory of R as the homotopy groups of BGL(R)+. Not only did this recover K1 and K2, the relation of K-theory to the Adams operations allowed Quillen to compute the K-groups of finite fields. The classifying space BGL is connected, so Quillen's definition failed to give the correct value for K0. Additionally, it did not give any negative K-groups. Since K0 had a known and accepted definition it was possible to sidestep this difficulty, but it remained technically awkward. Conceptually, the problem was that the definition sprung from GL, which was classically the source of K1. Because GL knows only about gluing vector bundles, not about the vector bundles themselves, it was impossible for it to describe K0. Inspired by conversations with Quillen, Segal soon introduced another approach to constructing algebraic K-theory under the name of Œì-objects.Segal 1974 Segal's approach is a homotopy analog of Grothendieck's construction of K0. Where Grothendieck worked with isomorphism classes of bundles, Segal worked with the bundles themselves and used isomorphisms of the bundles as part of his data. This results in a spectrum whose homotopy groups are the higher K-groups (including K0). However, Segal's approach was only able to impose relations for split exact sequences, not general exact sequences. In the category of projective modules over a ring, every short exact sequence splits, and so Œì-objects could be used to define the K-theory of a ring. However, there are non-split short exact sequences in the category of vector bundles on a variety and in the category of all modules over a ring, so Segal's approach did not apply to all cases of interest. In the spring of 1972, Quillen found another approach to the construction of higher K-theory which was to prove enormously successful. This new definition began with an exact category, a category satisfying certain formal properties similar to, but slightly weaker than, the properties satisfied by a category of modules or vector bundles. From this he constructed an auxiliary category using a new device called his \\"Q-construction.\\" Like Segal's Œì-objects, the Q-construction has its roots in Grothendieck's definition of K0. Unlike Grothendieck's definition, however, the Q-construction builds a category, not an abelian group, and unlike Segal's Œì-objects, the Q-construction works directly with short exact sequences. If C is an abelian category, then QC is a category with the same objects as C but whose morphisms are defined in terms of short exact sequences in C. The K-groups of the exact category are the homotopy groups of Œ©BQC, the loop space of the geometric realization (taking the loop space corrects the indexing). Quillen additionally proved his \\" theorem\\" that his two definitions of K-theory agreed with each other. This yielded the correct K0 and led to simpler proofs, but still did not yield any negative K-groups. All abelian categories are exact categories, but not all exact categories are abelian. Because Quillen was able to work in this more general situation, he was able to use exact categories as tools in his proofs. This technique allowed him to prove many of the basic theorems of algebraic K-theory. Additionally, it was possible to prove that the earlier definitions of Swan and Gersten were equivalent to Quillen's under certain conditions. K-theory now appeared to be a homology theory for rings and a cohomology theory for varieties. However, many of its basic theorems carried the hypothesis that the ring or variety in question was regular. One of the basic expected relations was a long exact sequence (called the \\"localization sequence\\") relating the K-theory of a variety X and an open subset U. Quillen was unable to prove the existence of the localization sequence in full generality. He was, however, able to prove its existence for a related theory called G-theory (or sometimes K‚Ä≤-theory). G-theory had been defined early in the development of the subject by Grothendieck. Grothendieck defined G0(X) for a variety X to be the free abelian group on isomorphism classes of coherent sheaves on X, modulo relations coming from exact sequences of coherent sheaves. In the categorical framework adopted by later authors, the K-theory of a variety is the K-theory of its category of vector bundles, while its G-theory is the K-theory of its category of coherent sheaves. Not only could Quillen prove the existence of a localization exact sequence for G-theory, he could prove that for a regular ring or variety, K-theory equaled G-theory, and therefore K-theory of regular varieties had a localization exact sequence. Since this sequence was fundamental to many of the facts in the subject, regularity hypotheses pervaded early work on higher K-theory. = Applications of algebraic K-theory in topology = The earliest application of algebraic K-theory to topology was Whitehead's construction of Whitehead torsion. A closely related construction was found by C. T. C. Wall in 1963.Wall 1965 Wall found that a space œÄ dominated by a finite complex has a generalized Euler characteristic taking values in a quotient of K0(ZœÄ), where œÄ is the fundamental group of the space. This invariant is called Wall's finiteness obstruction because X is homotopy equivalent to a finite complex if and only if the invariant vanishes. Laurent Siebenmann in his thesis found an invariant similar to Wall's that gives an obstruction to an open manifold being the interior of a compact manifold with boundary.Siebenmann 1965 If two manifolds with boundary M and N have isomorphic interiors (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate), then the isomorphism between them defines an h-cobordism between M and N. Whitehead torsion was eventually reinterpreted in a more directly K-theoretic way. This reinterpretation happened through the study of h-cobordisms. Two n-dimensional manifolds M and N are h-cobordant if there exists an -dimensional manifold with boundary W whose boundary is the disjoint union of M and N and for which the inclusions of M and N into W are homotopy equivalences (in the categories TOP, PL, or DIFF). Stephen Smale's h-cobordism theoremSmale 1962 asserted that if , W is compact, and M, N, and W are simply connected, then W is isomorphic to the cylinder (in TOP, PL, or DIFF as appropriate). This theorem proved the Poincar√© conjecture for . If M and N are not assumed to be simply connected, then an h-cobordism need not be a cylinder. The s-cobordism theorem, due independently to Mazur,Mazur 1963 Stallings, and Barden,Barden 1963 explains the general situation: An h-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if the Whitehead torsion of the inclusion vanishes. This generalizes the h-cobordism theorem because the simple connectedness hypotheses imply that the relevant Whitehead group is trivial. In fact the s-cobordism theorem implies that there is a bijective correspondence between isomorphism classes of h-cobordisms and elements of the Whitehead group. An obvious question associated with the existence of h-cobordisms is their uniqueness. The natural notion of equivalence is isotopy. Jean Cerf proved that for simply connected smooth manifolds M of dimension at least 5, isotopy of h-cobordisms is the same as a weaker notion called pseudo-isotopy.Cerf 1970 Hatcher and Wagoner studied the components of the space of pseudo-isotopies and related it to a quotient of K2(ZœÄ).Hatcher and Wagoner 1973 The proper context for the s-cobordism theorem is the classifying space of h-cobordisms. If M is a CAT manifold, then HCAT(M) is a space that classifies bundles of h-cobordisms on M. The s-cobordism theorem can be reinterpreted as the statement that the set of connected components of this space is the Whitehead group of œÄ1(M). This space contains strictly more information than the Whitehead group; for example, the connected component of the trivial cobordism describes the possible cylinders on M and in particular is the obstruction to the uniqueness of a homotopy between a manifold and . Consideration of these questions led Waldhausen to introduce his algebraic K-theory of spaces.Waldhausen 1978 The algebraic K-theory of M is a space A(M) which is defined so that it plays essentially the same role for higher K-groups as K1(ZœÄ1(M)) does for M. In particular, Waldhausen showed that there is a map from A(M) to a space Wh(M) which generalizes the map and whose homotopy fiber is a homology theory. In order to fully develop A-theory, Waldhausen made significant technical advances in the foundations of K-theory. Waldhausen introduced Waldhausen categories, and for a Waldhausen category C he introduced a simplicial category S*C (the S is for Segal) defined in terms of chains of cofibrations in C.Waldhausen 1985 This freed the foundations of K-theory from the need to invoke analogs of exact sequences. = Algebraic topology and algebraic geometry in algebraic K-theory = Quillen suggested to his student Kenneth Brown that it might be possible to create a theory of sheaves of spectra of which K-theory would provide an example. The sheaf of K-theory spectra would, to each open subset of a variety, associate the K-theory of that open subset. Brown developed such a theory for his thesis. Simultaneously, Gersten had the same idea. At a Seattle conference in autumn of 1972, they together discovered a spectral sequence converging from the sheaf cohomology of \\\\mathcal K_n, the sheaf of Kn-groups on X, to the K-group of the total space. This is now called the Brown‚ÄìGersten spectral sequence.Brown‚ÄìGersten 1973 Spencer Bloch, influenced by Gersten's work on sheaves of K-groups, proved that on a regular surface, the cohomology group H^2(X, \\\\mathcal K_2) is isomorphic to the Chow group CH2(X) of codimension 2 cycles on X.Bloch 1974 Inspired by this, Gersten conjectured that for a regular local ring R with fraction field F, Kn(R) injects into Kn(F) for all n. Soon Quillen proved that this is true when R contains a field,Quillen 1973 and using this he proved that :H^p(X, \\\\mathcal K_p) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{CH}^p(X) for all p. This is known as Bloch's formula. While progress has been made on Gersten's conjecture since then, the general case remains open. Lichtenbaum conjectured that special values of the zeta function of a number field could be expressed in terms of the K-groups of the ring of integers of the field. These special values were known to be related to the √©tale cohomology of the ring of integers. Quillen therefore generalized Lichtenbaum's conjecture, predicting the existence of a spectral sequence like the Atiyah‚ÄìHirzebruch spectral sequence in topological K-theory.Quillen 1975 Quillen's proposed spectral sequence would start from the √©tale cohomology of a ring R and, in high enough degrees and after completing at a prime invertible in R, abut to the -adic completion of the K-theory of R. In the case studied by Lichtenbaum, the spectral sequence would degenerate, yielding Lichtenbaum's conjecture. The necessity of localizing at a prime suggested to Browder that there should be a variant of K-theory with finite coefficients.Browder 1976 He introduced K-theory groups Kn(R; Z/Z) which were Z/Z-vector spaces, and he found an analog of the Bott element in topological K-theory. Soule used this theory to construct \\"√©tale Chern classes\\", an analog of topological Chern classes which took elements of algebraic K-theory to classes in √©tale cohomology.Soul√© 1979 Unlike algebraic K-theory, √©tale cohomology is highly computable, so √©tale Chern classes provided an effective tool for detecting the existence of elements in K-theory. William G. Dwyer and Eric Friedlander then invented an analog of K-theory for the √©tale topology called √©tale K-theory.Dwyer‚ÄìFriedlander 1982 For varieties defined over the complex numbers, √©tale K-theory is isomorphic to topological K-theory. Moreover, √©tale K-theory admitted a spectral sequence similar to the one conjectured by Quillen. Thomason proved around 1980 that after inverting the Bott element, algebraic K-theory with finite coefficients became isomorphic to √©tale K-theory.Thomason 1985 Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, K-theory on singular varieties still lacked adequate foundations. While it was believed that Quillen's K-theory gave the correct groups, it was not known that these groups had all of the envisaged properties. For this, algebraic K-theory had to be reformulated. This was done by Thomason in a lengthy monograph which he co-credited to his dead friend Thomas Trobaugh, who he said gave him a key idea in a dream.Thomason and Trobaugh 1990 Thomason combined Waldhausen's construction of K-theory with the foundations of intersection theory described in volume six of Grothendieck's S√©minaire de G√©om√©trie Alg√©brique du Bois Marie. There, K0 was described in terms of complexes of sheaves on algebraic varieties. Thomason discovered that if one worked with in derived category of sheaves, there was a simple description of when a complex of sheaves could be extended from an open subset of a variety to the whole variety. By applying Waldhausen's construction of K-theory to derived categories, Thomason was able to prove that algebraic K-theory had all the expected properties of a cohomology theory. In 1976, Keith Dennis discovered an entirely novel technique for computing K-theory based on Hochschild homology.Dennis 1976 This was based around the existence of the Dennis trace map, a homomorphism from K-theory to Hochschild homology. While the Dennis trace map seemed to be successful for calculations of K-theory with finite coefficients, it was less successful for rational calculations. Goodwillie, motivated by his \\"calculus of functors\\", conjectured the existence of a theory intermediate to K-theory and Hochschild homology. He called this theory topological Hochschild homology because its ground ring should be the sphere spectrum (considered as a ring whose operations are defined only up to homotopy). In the mid-1980s, Bokstedt gave a definition of topological Hochschild homology that satisfied nearly all of Goodwillie's conjectural properties, and this made possible further computations of K-groups.Bokstedt 1986 Bokstedt's version of the Dennis trace map was a transformation of spectra . This transformation factored through the fixed points of a circle action on THH, which suggested a relationship with cyclic homology. In the course of proving an algebraic K-theory analog of the Novikov conjecture, Bokstedt, Hsiang, and Madsen introduced topological cyclic homology, which bore the same relationship to topological Hochschild homology as cyclic homology did to Hochschild homology.Bokstedt‚ÄìHsiang‚ÄìMadsen 1993 The Dennis trace map to topological Hochschild homology facts through topological cyclic homology, providing an even more detailed tool for calculations. In 1996, Dundas, Goodwillie, and McCarthy proved that topological cyclic homology has in a precise sense the same local structure as algebraic K-theory, so that if a calculation in K-theory or topological cyclic homology is possible, then many other \\"nearby\\" calculations follow.Dundas‚ÄìGoodwillie‚ÄìMcCarthy 2012  Lower K-groups  The lower K-groups were discovered first, and given various ad hoc descriptions, which remain useful. Throughout, let A be a ring. = K0 = The functor K0 takes a ring A to the Grothendieck group of the set of isomorphism classes of its finitely generated projective modules, regarded as a monoid under direct sum. Any ring homomorphism A ‚Üí B gives a map K0(A) ‚Üí K0(B) by mapping (the class of) a projective A-module M to M ‚äóA B, making K0 a covariant functor. If the ring A is commutative, we can define a subgroup of K0(A) as the set : \\\\tilde{K}_0\\\\left(A\\\\right) = \\\\bigcap\\\\limits_{\\\\mathfrak p\\\\text{ prime ideal of }A}\\\\mathrm{Ker}\\\\dim_{\\\\mathfrak p}, where : :\\\\dim_{\\\\mathfrak p}:K_0\\\\left(A\\\\right)\\\\to \\\\mathbf{Z} is the map sending every (class of a) finitely generated projective A-module M to the rank of the free A_{\\\\mathfrak p}-module M_{\\\\mathfrak p} (this module is indeed free, as any finitely generated projective module over a local ring is free). This subgroup \\\\tilde{K}_0\\\\left(A\\\\right) is known as the reduced zeroth K-theory of A. If B is a ring without an identity element, we can extend the definition of K0 as follows. Let A = B‚äïZ be the extension of B to a ring with unity obtaining by adjoining an identity element (0,1). There is a short exact sequence B ‚Üí A ‚Üí Z and we define K0(B) to be the kernel of the corresponding map K0(A) ‚Üí K0(Z) = Z.Rosenberg (1994) p.30 Examples * (Projective) modules over a field k are vector spaces and K0(k) is isomorphic to Z, by dimension. * Finitely generated projective modules over a local ring A are free and so in this case once again K0(A) is isomorphic to Z, by rank.Milnor (1971) p.5 * For A a Dedekind domain, :K0(A) = Pic(A) ‚äï Z, where Pic(A) is the Picard group of A,Milnor (1971) p.14 and similarly the reduced K-theory is given by :\\\\tilde K_0(A)=\\\\operatorname{Pic} A. An algebro-geometric variant of this construction is applied to the category of algebraic varieties; it associates with a given algebraic variety X the Grothendieck's K-group of the category of locally free sheaves (or coherent sheaves) on X. Given a compact topological space X, the topological K-theory Ktop(X) of (real) vector bundles over X coincides with K0 of the ring of continuous real-valued functions on X., see Theorem I.6.18 Relative K0 Let I be an ideal of A and define the \\"double\\" to be a subring of the Cartesian product A√óA:Rosenberg (1994) 1.5.1, p.27 :D(A,I) = \\\\\\\\{ (x,y) \\\\in A \\\\times A : x-y \\\\in I \\\\\\\\} \\\\ . The relative K-group is defined in terms of the \\"double\\"Rosenberg (1994) 1.5.3, p.27 :K_0(A,I) = \\\\ker \\\\left({ K_0(D(A,I)) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A) }\\\\right) \\\\ . where the map is induced by projection along the first factor. The relative K0(A,I) is isomorphic to K0(I), regarding I as a ring without identity. The independence from A is an analogue of the Excision theorem in homology. K0 as a ring If A is a commutative ring, then the tensor product of projective modules is again projective, and so tensor product induces a multiplication turning K0 into a commutative ring with the class [A] as identity. The exterior product similarly induces a Œª-ring structure. The Picard group embeds as a subgroup of the group of units K0(A)‚àó.Milnor (1971) p.15 = K1 = Hyman Bass provided this definition, which generalizes the group of units of a ring: K1(A) is the abelianization of the infinite general linear group: :K_1(A) = \\\\operatorname{GL}(A)^{\\\\mbox{ab}} = \\\\operatorname{GL}(A) / [\\\\operatorname{GL}(A),\\\\operatorname{GL}(A)] Here :\\\\operatorname{GL}(A) = \\\\operatorname{colim} \\\\operatorname{GL}(n, A) is the direct limit of the GL(n), which embeds in GL(n + 1) as the upper left block matrix, and [\\\\operatorname{GL}(A), \\\\operatorname{GL}(A)] is its commutator subgroup. Define an elementary matrix to be one which is the sum of an identity matrix and a single off-diagonal element (this is a subset of the elementary matrices used in linear algebra). Then Whitehead's lemma states that the group E(A) generated by elementary matrices equals the commutator subgroup [GL(A), GL(A)]. Indeed, the group GL(A)/E(A) was first defined and studied by Whitehead,J.H.C. Whitehead, Simple homotopy types Amer. J. Math. , 72 (1950) pp. 1‚Äì57 and is called the Whitehead group of the ring A.  Relative K1  The relative K-group is defined in terms of the \\"double\\"Rosenberg (1994) 2.5.1, p.92 :K_1(A,I) = \\\\ker \\\\left({ K_1(D(A,I)) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A) }\\\\right) \\\\ . There is a natural exact sequenceRosenberg (1994) 2.5.4, p.95 : K_1(A,I) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A/I) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A,I) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A) \\\\rightarrow K_0(A/I) \\\\ .  Commutative rings and fields  For A a commutative ring, one can define a determinant det: GL(A) ‚Üí A* to the group of units of A, which vanishes on E(A) and thus descends to a map det : K1(A) ‚Üí A*. As E(A) ‚óÖ SL(A), one can also define the special Whitehead group SK1(A) := SL(A)/E(A). This map splits via the map A* ‚Üí GL(1, A) ‚Üí K1(A) (unit in the upper left corner), and hence is onto, and has the special Whitehead group as kernel, yielding the split short exact sequence: :1 \\\\to SK_1(A) \\\\to K_1(A) \\\\to A^* \\\\to 1, which is a quotient of the usual split short exact sequence defining the special linear group, namely :1 \\\\to \\\\operatorname{SL}(A) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{GL}(A) \\\\to A^* \\\\to 1. The determinant is split by including the group of units A* = GL1(A) into the general linear group GL(A), so K1(A) splits as the direct sum of the group of units and the special Whitehead group: K1(A) ‚âÖ A* ‚äï SK1 (A). When A is a Euclidean domain (e.g. a field, or the integers) SK1(A) vanishes, and the determinant map is an isomorphism from K1(A) to A‚àó.Rosenberg (1994) Theorem 2.3.2, p.74 This is false in general for PIDs, thus providing one of the rare mathematical features of Euclidean domains that do not generalize to all PIDs. An explicit PID such that SK1 is nonzero was given by Ischebeck in 1980 and by Grayson in 1981.Rosenberg (1994) p.75 If A is a Dedekind domain whose quotient field is an algebraic number field (a finite extension of the rationals) then shows that SK1(A) vanishes.Rosenberg (1994) p.81 The vanishing of SK1 can be interpreted as saying that K1 is generated by the image of GL1 in GL. When this fails, one can ask whether K1 is generated by the image of GL2. For a Dedekind domain, this is the case: indeed, K1 is generated by the images of GL1 and SL2 in GL. The subgroup of SK1 generated by SL2 may be studied by Mennicke symbols. For Dedekind domains with all quotients by maximal ideals finite, SK1 is a torsion group.Rosenberg (1994) p.78 For a non-commutative ring, the determinant cannot in general be defined, but the map GL(A) ‚Üí K1(A) is a generalisation of the determinant. Central simple algebras In the case of a central simple algebra A over a field F, the reduced norm provides a generalisation of the determinant giving a map K1(A) ‚Üí F‚àó and SK1(A) may be defined as the kernel. Wang's theorem states that if A has prime degree then SK1(A) is trivial,Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.47 and this may be extended to square-free degree.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.48 Wang also showed that SK1(A) is trivial for any central simple algebra over a number field, but Platonov has given examples of algebras of degree prime squared for which SK1(A) is non-trivial. = K2 = John Milnor found the right definition of K2: it is the center of the Steinberg group St(A) of A. It can also be defined as the kernel of the map :\\\\varphi\\\\colon\\\\operatorname{St}(A)\\\\to\\\\mathrm{GL}(A), or as the Schur multiplier of the group of elementary matrices. For a field, K2 is determined by Steinberg symbols: this leads to Matsumoto's theorem. One can compute that K2 is zero for any finite field.Lam (2005) p.139Lemmermeyer (2000) p.66 The computation of K2(Q) is complicated: Tate provedMilnor (1971) p.101 :K_2(\\\\mathbf{Q}) = (\\\\mathbf{Z}/4)^* \\\\times \\\\prod_{p \\\\text{ odd prime}} (\\\\mathbf{Z}/p)^* \\\\ and remarked that the proof followed Gauss's first proof of the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity.Milnor (1971) p.102Gras (2003) p.205 For non-Archimedean local fields, the group K2(F) is the direct sum of a finite cyclic group of order m, say, and a divisible group K2(F)m.Milnor (1971) p.175 We have K2(Z) = Z/2,Milnor (1971) p.81 and in general K2 is finite for the ring of integers of a number field.Lemmermeyer (2000) p.385 We further have K2(Z/n) = Z/2 if n is divisible by 4, and otherwise zero.Silvester (1981) p.228 Matsumoto's theorem Matsumoto's theorem states that for a field k, the second K-group is given byRosenberg (1994) Theorem 4.3.15, p.214 :K_2(k) = k^\\\\times\\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbf Z} k^\\\\times/\\\\langle a\\\\otimes(1-a)\\\\mid a ot=0,1\\\\rangle. Matsumoto's original theorem is even more general: For any root system, it gives a presentation for the unstable K-theory. This presentation is different from the one given here only for symplectic root systems. For non-symplectic root systems, the unstable second K-group with respect to the root system is exactly the stable K-group for GL(A). Unstable second K-groups (in this context) are defined by taking the kernel of the universal central extension of the Chevalley group of universal type for a given root system. This construction yields the kernel of the Steinberg extension for the root systems An (n > 1) and, in the limit, stable second K-groups. Long exact sequences If A is a Dedekind domain with field of fractions F then there is a long exact sequence : K_2F \\\\rightarrow \\\\oplus_{\\\\mathbf p} K_1 A/{\\\\mathbf p} \\\\rightarrow K_1 A \\\\rightarrow K_1 F \\\\rightarrow \\\\oplus_{\\\\mathbf p} K_0 A/{\\\\mathbf p} \\\\rightarrow K_0 A \\\\rightarrow K_0 F \\\\rightarrow 0 \\\\ where p runs over all prime ideals of A.Milnor (1971) p.123 There is also an extension of the exact sequence for relative K1 and K0:Rosenberg (1994) p.200 :K_2(A) \\\\rightarrow K_2(A/I) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A,I) \\\\rightarrow K_1(A) \\\\cdots \\\\ . Pairing There is a pairing on K1 with values in K2. Given commuting matrices X and Y over A, take elements x and y in the Steinberg group with X,Y as images. The commutator x y x^{-1} y^{-1} is an element of K2.Milnor (1971) p.63 The map is not always surjective.Milnor (1971) p.69  Milnor K-theory  The above expression for K2 of a field k led Milnor to the following definition of \\"higher\\" K-groups by : K^M_*(k) := T^*(k^\\\\times)/(a\\\\otimes (1-a)), thus as graded parts of a quotient of the tensor algebra of the multiplicative group k√ó by the two-sided ideal, generated by the :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{a\\\\otimes(1-a): \\\\ a eq 0,1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. For n = 0,1,2 these coincide with those below, but for n ‚âß 3 they differ in general., cf. Lemma 1.8 For example, we have K'(Fq) = 0 for n ‚âß 2 but KnFq is nonzero for odd n (see below). The tensor product on the tensor algebra induces a product K_m \\\\times K_n \\\\rightarrow K_{m+n} making K^M_*(F) a graded ring which is graded-commutative.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.184 The images of elements a_1 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes a_n in K^M_n(k) are termed symbols, denoted \\\\\\\\{a_1,\\\\ldots,a_n\\\\\\\\}. For integer m invertible in k there is a map :\\\\partial : k^* \\\\rightarrow H^1(k,\\\\mu_m) where \\\\mu_m denotes the group of m-th roots of unity in some separable extension of k. This extends to :\\\\partial^n : k^* \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times k^* \\\\rightarrow H^n\\\\left({k,\\\\mu_m^{\\\\otimes n}}\\\\right) \\\\ satisfying the defining relations of the Milnor K-group. Hence \\\\partial^n may be regarded as a map on K^M_n(k), called the Galois symbol map.Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.108 The relation between √©tale (or Galois) cohomology of the field and Milnor K-theory modulo 2 is the Milnor conjecture, proven by Vladimir Voevodsky. The analogous statement for odd primes is the Bloch-Kato conjecture, proved by Voevodsky, Rost, and others.  Higher K-theory  The accepted definitions of higher K-groups were given by , after a few years during which several incompatible definitions were suggested. The object of the program was to find definitions of K(R) and K(R,I) in terms of classifying spaces so that R ‚áí K(R) and (R,I) ‚áí K(R,I) are functors into a homotopy category of spaces and the long exact sequence for relative K-groups arises as the long exact homotopy sequence of a fibration K(R,I) ‚Üí K(R) ‚Üí K(R/I).Rosenberg (1994) pp. 245‚Äì246 Quillen gave two constructions, the \\"plus-construction\\" and the \\"Q-construction\\", the latter subsequently modified in different ways.Rosenberg (1994) p.246 The two constructions yield the same K-groups.Rosenberg (1994) p.289 = The +-construction = One possible definition of higher algebraic K-theory of rings was given by Quillen : K_n(R) = \\\\pi_n(B\\\\operatorname{GL}(R)^+), Here œÄn is a homotopy group, GL(R) is the direct limit of the general linear groups over R for the size of the matrix tending to infinity, B is the classifying space construction of homotopy theory, and the + is Quillen's plus construction. This definition only holds for n > 0 so one often defines the higher algebraic K-theory via : K_n(R) = \\\\pi_n(B\\\\operatorname{GL}(R)^+\\\\times K_0(R)) Since BGL(R)+ is path connected and K0(R) discrete, this definition doesn't differ in higher degrees and also holds for n = 0\\\\. = The Q-construction = The Q-construction gives the same results as the +-construction, but it applies in more general situations. Moreover, the definition is more direct in the sense that the K-groups, defined via the Q-construction are functorial by definition. This fact is not automatic in the plus-construction. Suppose P is an exact category; associated to P a new category QP is defined, objects of which are those of P and morphisms from M‚Ä≤ to M‚Ä≥ are isomorphism classes of diagrams : M'\\\\longleftarrow N\\\\longrightarrow M, where the first arrow is an admissible epimorphism and the second arrow is an admissible monomorphism. The i-th K-group of the exact category P is then defined as : K_i(P)=\\\\pi_{i+1}(\\\\mathrm{BQ}P,0) with a fixed zero-object 0, where BQP is the classifying space of QP, which is defined to be the geometric realisation of the nerve of QP. This definition coincides with the above definition of K0(P). If P is the category of finitely generated projective R-modules, this definition agrees with the above BGL+ definition of Kn(R) for all n. More generally, for a scheme X, the higher K-groups of X are defined to be the K-groups of (the exact category of) locally free coherent sheaves on X. The following variant of this is also used: instead of finitely generated projective (= locally free) modules, take finitely generated modules. The resulting K-groups are usually written Gn(R). When R is a noetherian regular ring, then G- and K-theory coincide. Indeed, the global dimension of regular rings is finite, i.e. any finitely generated module has a finite projective resolution P* ‚Üí M, and a simple argument shows that the canonical map K0(R) ‚Üí G0(R) is an isomorphism, with [M]=Œ£ ¬± [Pn]. This isomorphism extends to the higher K-groups, too. = The S-construction = A third construction of K-theory groups is the S-construction, due to Waldhausen.. See also Lecture IV and the references in It applies to categories with cofibrations (also called Waldhausen categories). This is a more general concept than exact categories.  Examples  While the Quillen algebraic K-theory has provided deep insight into various aspects of algebraic geometry and topology, the K-groups have proved particularly difficult to compute except in a few isolated but interesting cases. (See also: K-groups of a field.) = Algebraic K-groups of finite fields = The first and one of the most important calculations of the higher algebraic K-groups of a ring were made by Quillen himself for the case of finite fields: If Fq is the finite field with q elements, then: * K0(Fq) = Z, * K2i(Fq) = 0 for i ‚â•1, * K2i‚Äì1(Fq) = Z/(q i ‚àí 1)Z for i ‚â• 1\\\\. reproved Quillen's computation using different methods. = Algebraic K-groups of rings of integers = Quillen proved that if A is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field F (a finite extension of the rationals), then the algebraic K-groups of A are finitely generated. Armand Borel used this to calculate Ki(A) and Ki(F) modulo torsion. For example, for the integers Z, Borel proved that (modulo torsion) * Ki (Z)/tors.=0 for positive i unless i=4k+1 with k positive * K4k+1 (Z)/tors.= Z for positive k. The torsion subgroups of K2i+1(Z), and the orders of the finite groups K4k+2(Z) have recently been determined, but whether the latter groups are cyclic, and whether the groups K4k(Z) vanish depends upon Vandiver's conjecture about the class groups of cyclotomic integers. See Quillen‚ÄìLichtenbaum conjecture for more details.  Applications and open questions  Algebraic K-groups are used in conjectures on special values of L-functions and the formulation of a non-commutative main conjecture of Iwasawa theory and in construction of higher regulators.Lemmermeyer (2000) p.385 Parshin's conjecture concerns the higher algebraic K-groups for smooth varieties over finite fields, and states that in this case the groups vanish up to torsion. Another fundamental conjecture due to Hyman Bass (Bass' conjecture) says that all of the groups Gn(A) are finitely generated when A is a finitely generated Z-algebra. (The groups Gn(A) are the K-groups of the category of finitely generated A-modules) , Lecture VI  See also  *Bloch's formula *Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory *Basic theorems in algebraic K-theory *K-theory *K-theory of a category *K-group of a field *K-theory spectrum *Redshift conjecture *Topological K-theory *Rigidity (K-theory) Notes  References    (lower K-groups) (Quillen's Q-construction) * (relation of Q-construction to plus-construction) *.

It is a Latin word, first coined in the third century AD, meaning \\"Roman-ness\\" and has been used by modern historians as shorthand to refer to Roman identity and self-image. Literal meaning and origin Romanitas means, as a rough approximation, Roman-ness in Latin, although it has also been translated as \\"Romanism, the Roman way or manner\\". The term, not common in Roman sources, was first coined by the 3rd century Roman writer Tertullian, an early Christian from North Africa, in his work De Pallio. Tertullian used the term pejoratively to refer to those in his native Carthage who aped Roman culture. Concepts behind literal meaning Romanitas is used to refer to the collection of political and cultural concepts and practices defining what it is to be a Roman. Unlike the Greeks, the Romans did not see their common identity as being based on language and inherited ethnicity. Their identity was based on being part of a political and religious community with common values, customs, morality and way of life. That made historians seek to define romanitas using a number of approaches: one way is to consider the general ideals Romans attributed to themselves; another approach, which has achieved consensus among scholars, is to consider the construction of Roman identity during the process of colonisation. However, not all scholars accept that the notion of identity, which is inherited from social sciences, is adequate to understand what is to be Roman.SILVA, A. J. M. 2012, From lost Roman pottery to broken identities in Post-modern times: on the use of the concept of identity in Roman Archaeology, 28th Congress of the Rei Cretariae Romanae Fautores, Catania. https://www.academia.edu/1994803/From_lost_Roman_pottery_to_broken_identities_in_Post- modern_times_on_the_use_of_the_concept_of_identity_in_Roman_Archaeology It was not a word often used in ancient times, but it is used by modern writers to express the ideals which inspired the Roman State. It meant a great many things, but in short it meant what it was to be Roman (that is, Roman-ness). The Roman ideal was the citizen/soldier/farmer. The farmer was a hard working, frugal, practical man who worked the land with his own hands. The soldier was a courageous, strong man who obeyed orders and risked his own life in the name of Rome. Prior to the formation, under Gaius Marius, of the standing Roman Army, Rome had a militia-type defence-force which could be called up in time of war and then disbanded during peacetime. The ideal of the homo militaris ‚Äì embodying the functions of the citizen, soldier and farmer ‚Äì was Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. According to Roman legend, Cincinnatus was tending his farm when a messenger arrived, telling him that Rome was under attack and that he had been elected dictator. He was at first reluctant to go, but the Senate pleaded with him. He defeated the enemy tribe within a matter of weeks and, despite there remaining most of his six-month term as dictator with absolute power, returned to his farm. The attainment and possession of the virtue of gravitas was highly valued by Romans of the early Republic and by Roman intellectuals. Indeed, gravitas was the single most clarifying characteristic of early republican Roman society: The virtuous character of the Romans, their honesty and trustworthiness, is shown in the way they handled their finances. Polybius remarks: \\"Greek statesmen, if entrusted with a single talent, though protected by ten checking-clerks, as many seals and twice as many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep faith; whereas among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies, men have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from pure respect for their oath keep their faith intact.\\" Their cultural characteristics led to their development of \\"self government\\" by adopting a classical republic and thus this class formed the backbone of the Roman Republic. Because of the widespread influence of Roman classical literature, the idea of the homo militaris also took root in colonial and early United States.

Ariel was first established in 1978 and its population was in , composed of veteran and young Israelis, English- speaking immigrants, and immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, with an additional influx of 10,000 students.Ariel municipality Official website It is the fourth largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank, after Modi'in Illit, Beitar Illit, and Ma'ale Adumim. The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Ariel's jurisdiction spans , and borders the Palestinian towns and villages Salfit, Marda and Iskaka. According to B'Tselem, within Ariel's municipal area there are several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them. Etymology Ariel (pronounced Ari'el), literally means 'Lion of God'. \\"Ari\\" (Lion) in Hebrew is also a synonym for bravery and courage and it is also the symbol of the tribe of Judah. The city of Ariel is named after Jerusalem.Ariel Founder details Ariel's history Ariel in the Hebrew Bible is one of the names for Jerusalem and the Temple of Jerusalem (Isaiah 29:1‚Äì8). History Ariel was founded in 1978 on land that was seized for military needs and on land that was declared state land, including cultivated farmland of Palestinian villages in the district and on rocky land the villagers used for grazing their flocks. At the beginning of 1978, a group of Israelis formed in order to create a settlement in the hills of the northern part of the West Bank made a formal request to the government to be given land to build a new community and were given three options by the army; the area near the 'lone tree' which would later become Barkan, the area which would later become Kfar Tapuach, and a hill near Kifl Hares that was known to the local Arabs as 'Jabel Mawat', the hill of death, because of inhospitable terrain. The leader of this group, Ron Nachman, chose the latter because of its strategic location on a possible Jordanian invasion route towards Israel's main population centre of Tel Aviv. In the spring of 1978, some of the group's men erected tents on the chosen hilltop, and in August 1978, a total of forty families came to live in the settlement. The original members of the group had gone through a screening process in order to put together a mix of skilled adults as well as young families that would be prepared psychologically to withstand starting a new settlement from scratch with little infrastructure and modern comforts. There were no paved roads or paths. Water was supplied periodically by a tanker truck. Electricity was provided by a generator since no electrical network existed in that area. Tents were replaced by prefabricated concrete blocks which served as living quarters, schools, and an infirmary. On September 1, 1978, the school year was officially opened. From 1978 to 1988, Ariel continued to develop, and established itself as the urban center for the nearby Jewish settlements. In 1980, the prefabricated homes were replaced with permanent housing. The College of Judea and Samaria, which would later become the Ariel University Center of Samaria, and eventually Ariel University, was founded in 1982. Three elementary schools, a community center, a sports hall, and a synagogue were built. In May 1982, Ariel was connected to the national power grid. During the mass immigration of Jews from Soviet Union that began in 1989 and continued throughout the 1990s, Ariel, which had a population of 8,000 in 1990, experienced a population boom. Unlike in Israel proper, apartments in Ariel were plentiful and cheap, which proved attractive to the immigrants.Soviet immigrants mark Passover ‚Äì The Spokesman Review. 9 April 1990 Some 6,000 Soviet immigrants moved to Ariel, almost doubling its population. In 2005, the residents of Netzarim, a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip which had been evacuated, found temporary housing in the dormitories of the Ariel University Center of Samaria. At the beginning of the academic year, about one-third chose to settle permanently in Ariel, while the rest moved to Yevul. In 2007, the city began receiving immigrants from English-speaking countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa in significant numbers. Nachman, a central figure in the Likud party, presided over Ariel from 1978 until his death in January 2013, at first as head of the local council and as mayor from 1985, when the settlement was officially recognized as a city. Both religious and secular Jews reside in Ariel. The city has sixteen synagogues. On 5 February 2018, an Israeli man was stabbed to death in a terror attack at a bus station at the entrance of Ariel.

Peacenow, May 2005Virtuel Israel Experience: Ariel The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise and west of the Jordan River, Jordan's western border. Ariel is adjacent to the Palestinian Authority town of Salfit and southwest of Nablus. It is approximately east of Petah Tikva, and east of Tel Aviv to which it is connected by the Highway 5 and northwest of Jerusalem, to which it is connected by Highway 60. Ariel's jurisdiction spans , and borders the Palestinian towns and villages Salfit, Marda and Iskaka. Ariel's municipal area contains several enclaves of privately owned Palestinian land, whose owners are not allowed access to them. The central water pumping station in Salfit has been polluted several times by overflow from the wastewater in Ariel. Economy The city has several shopping centres and two industrial zones (divided into light and heavy industry), a library. In July 2008, Israel approved the construction of 27 new factories, which were expected to be completed by September 2009. Political status Like other settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Ariel is considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.Patience, Martin Kadima victory concerns settlers BBC, 31 March 2006 A series of Israeli governments has insisted that Ariel be included within Israel's future borders under any future peace treaty. The Israeli Ministry of the Interior gave the municipality of Ariel the status of a city council in 1998. In January 2010, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by leading figures in his governing coalition, declared Ariel the \\"capital of Samaria\\", and an integral part of Israel. In December 2010, thirty-five MKs petitioned the government to annex Ariel to Israel.\\"Knesset members demand annexation of Ariel settlement\\" , The Palestine Telegraph, 4 December 2010. Palestinian representatives have opposed the incorporation of Ariel into Israel in any future settlement, arguing that the Ariel 'finger' would interrupt the territorial integrity of a Palestinian state and includes a major aquifer. Ariel's future is thus not clear: \\"as well as an obstacle to an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, it could also serve as a crucial trade-off for negotiators hammering out a final deal.\\" McDonald's Israel, the local subsidiary of the international fast food chain, turned down an offer to open a restaurant in Ariel in June 2013, citing its declared policy not to open any branches in West Bank settlements across the Green Line. Education and culture Ariel is home to the Ariel University, founded in 1982 as the College of Judea of Samaria. It later became known as the Ariel University Center of Samaria. Current enrollment is 12,000, consisting of both Jewish and Arab students. On December 24, 2012, after many legal battles, the school became fully accredited and recognized as the 9th Israeli University. University status is an issue of prestige, increased government funding, as well as the ability to open post-graduate studies (which are already offered at the college) and issue doctorate degrees. Formerly called the 'Academic College of Judea and Samaria', it changed its name in August 2007 in the interim period and anticipation of achieving the more prestigious 'university' status. The state-funded Ariel Center for the Performing Arts opened on November 8, 2010, with a performance of Piaf by the Beersheba Theater company. These performances were boycotted by sixty Israeli actors, writers, and directors, including Joshua Sobol, who refuse to perform in settlements. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Culture Minister Limor Livnat and the leader of the Kadima Party Tzipi Livni condemned the boycott and proposed cutting government funding those participating in it.Macintyre, Donald. \\"Israeli actors refuse to take the stage in settlement theatre\\", The Independent, 30 August 2010 The boycott was supported by Amos Oz, David Grossman and A. B. Yehoshua,Fyler, Boaz. \\"Yehoshua, Oz, Grossman back boycott of Ariel\\", Ynet News\\" 30 August 2010 It was opposed by Amnon Shamosh, who suggested that the boycott plays into the hands of right-wing extremists by linking art and politics. 150 U.S. actors supported the boycott.Israeli Artists Condemn Settlements, Jewish Voice for Peace However, five Israeli actors later withdrew from the boycott, indicating that they changed their mind or thought the letter they were signing called for a discussion on the issue rather than outright boycott. West Bank barrier The Israeli West Bank barrier was originally planned to extend out from the Israeli border to Ariel. Under American political pressure, the \\"finger\\", as the extension of the fence to include Ariel is often called, was not built. Instead, Ariel has a security fence surrounding it on only three sides.Westervelt, Eric. \\"Israeli Settlement Seeks Protection\\", National Public Radio International relations =Twin towns/ Sister cities= Ariel is twinned with: * Heredia, Costa Rica * Mobile, Alabama, United States * Cead√Ær-Lunga, Moldova * Divjak√´, Albania References External links * Ariel municipality Home page Hebrew * Ariel municipality Home page English * Ariel University Home page English * Ariel Center For The Performing Arts Home page Hebrew Cities in the West Bank Mixed Israeli settlements Populated places established in 1978 Israeli settlements 1978 establishments in the Israeli Military Governorate ","title":"Ariel (city)"},{"id":"598526","text":"Members of the parrot genus Psittacula or Afro-Asian ring-necked parakeets as they are commonly known in aviculture originates found from Africa to South- East Asia.

The majority of the Loriculus species occur on islands. Moreover, since Loriculus is spread across both sides of the Wallace Line it can be considered more Australasian than Asian. These parrots mostly have green plumage, with adults having coloured heads. The bill is stout, and the tail is long and graduated. The genus Psittacula was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1800. The type species was subsequently designated as the red-breasted parakeet. The name of the genus is a diminutive of the Latin word psittacus for a \\"parrot\\". Species and phylogeny = Current taxonomy = Phylogeny of the genus Psittacula based on existing molecular evidence. Species with red lines are currently unplaced in the phylogeny, but do belong to this genus. The genus includes 16 species, of which three are extinct. * Newton's parakeet, Psittacula exsul - extinct (c.1875) * Echo parakeet, Psittacula eques ** R√©union parakeet, Psittacula eques eques - extinct mid-18th century * Mascarene grey parakeet, Psittacula bensoni - extinct (c.1764) * Rose-ringed parakeet, Psittacula krameri * Alexandrine parakeet, Psittacula eupatria * Seychelles parakeet, Psittacula wardi - extinct (1883) * Plum-headed parakeet, Psittacula cyanocephala * Blossom-headed parakeet, Psittacula roseata * Slaty-headed parakeet, Psittacula himalayana * Grey-headed parakeet, Psittacula finschii * Blue- winged parakeet, Psittacula columboides * Layard's parakeet, Psittacula calthrapae * Lord Derby's parakeet, Psittacula derbiana * Red-breasted parakeet, Psittacula alexandri (also called moustached parakeet) * Long-tailed parakeet, Psittacula longicauda * Nicobar parakeet, Psittacula caniceps = Alternative taxonomy = Recent genetic evidence has found that the genus Psittacula is likely paraphyletic; for example, genetic analysis has supported merging short-tailed parrots of the genus Tanygnathus, Psittinus, and the extinct Mascarinus with Psittacula. An alternative classification system to this was proposed by Braun et al. (2019) that splits the genus Psittacula into multiple monophyletic genera in order to preserve Tanygnathus, Psittinus, and Mascarinus as distinct genera. After the proposed split, the only remaining species in Psittacula sensu stricto are P. derbiana and P. alexandri. The list of split or monophyletic genera and species is displayed below: * Genus Himalayapsitta **Plum-headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta cyanocephala ** Grey- headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta finschii ** Slaty-headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta himalayana **Blossom-headed parakeet, Himalayapsitta roseata * Genus Nicopsitta **Blue-winged parakeet, Nicopsitta columboides **Layard's parakeet, Nicopsitta calthrapae * Genus Belocercus **Long-tailed parakeet, Belocercus longicauda * Genus Psittacula **Red-breasted parakeet, Psittacula alexandri ** Lord Derby's parakeet, Psittacula derbiana * Genus Palaeornis **Alexandrine parakeet, Palaeornis eupatria ** ‚Ä†Seychelles parakeet, Palaeornis wardi * Genus Alexandrinus **Rose-ringed parakeet, Alexandrinus krameri ** ‚Ä†Newton's parakeet, Alexandrinus exsul ** Mauritius parakeet, Alexandrinus (eques) echo * Genus Tanygnathus **Great-billed parrot, Tanygnathus megalorynchos ** Blue-naped parrot, Tanygnathus lucionensis ** Blue-backed parrot, Tanygnathus sumatranus ** Black-lored parrot, Tanygnathus gramineus * Genus Psittinus **Blue-rumped parrot, Psittinus cyanurus ** Simeulue parrot, Psittinus abbotti * Genus Mascarinus **‚Ä†Mascarene parrot, Mascarinus mascarin The study has not yet classified P. bensoni or P. caniceps. It has also found that the rose-ringed and Alexandrine parakeets are likely paraphyletic species themselves, and thus need to be split into multiple species. = Hypothetical extinct species = The Rothschild's or intermediate parakeet P. intermedia, found in northern India, was formerly considered a mystery, as only very few specimens were known. It has since been demonstrated to be a hybrid between the slaty-headed parakeet P. himalayana and the plum-headed parakeet P. cyanocephala. The taxonomy of the R√©union parakeet P. eques is also confusing. Extinct since 1770, little evidence even exists of the bird's existence. A study skin had been discovered at the Royal Museum of Scotland, explicitly referencing a book description of the R√©union birds. It is known from other descriptions, as well as illustrations of which it is unknown whether they were drawn from live or stuffed specimens. This may be the only material proof of these birds' existence. Taxonomists are unsure if the birds were a distinct species, or conspecific with the Mauritius parakeet, although genetic analysis supports it being a subspecies of the Mauritius parakeet.

His book, A History of the Birds of New Zealand, first published in 1873, was published as an enlarged version in 1888 and became a New Zealand classic. Biography Buller was born at Newark, the Wesleyan mission at Pakanae in the Hokianga, the son of Rev. James Buller, a Cornish missionary who had helped convert the people of Tonga to Methodism. He was educated at Wesley College in Auckland. In 1854, he moved to Wellington with his parents, where he was befriended by the naturalist William John Swainson. In 1859 he was made Native Commissioner for the Southern Provinces. In 1871 he travelled to England and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. Three years later he returned to Wellington and practised law. In 1862, he married Charlotte Mair at Whangarei. They were to have four children. Buller was the author of A History of the Birds of New Zealand (1872‚Äì1873, 2nd ed. 1887‚Äì1888), with illustrations by John Gerrard Keulemans (and Henrik Gr√∂nvold?). In 1882 he produced the Manual of the Birds of New Zealand as a cheaper popular alternative. In 1905, he published a two-volume Supplement to the History of the Birds of New Zealand, which brought the work up to date. Buller was appointed Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George in 1875. In November 1886, he was promoted to Knight Commander. Buller helped establish the scientific display in the New Zealand Court at the World's Fair in Paris and was decorated with the Officer of the Legion of Honour by the President of France in November 1889.Brewer, M., 'New Zealand and the Legion d'honneur: Officiers, Commandeurs and Dignites', The Volunteers: The Journal of the New Zealand Military Historical Society, 35(3), March 2010, p.136.'Death of Sir Walter Buller, A noted Ornithologist', Evening Post, 20 July 1906, p.6. He had several unsuccessful attempts at entering Parliament as a Liberal. He contested the general elections of 1876 (; beaten by the incumbent Walter Johnston) and (, where he came fourth of six candidates), and the in the electorate (where he was beaten by William Fraser, the official Liberal Party candidate). He emigrated to England and died at Fleet in Hampshire on 19 July 1906. Wellington playwright Nick Blake authored a play on Buller's life, Dr Buller's Birds, which had its debut at the 2006 NZ International Arts Festival.

Due to gravitational lensing, the light is diverted, making it seem to come from different places. If source, lens, and observer are all aligned, the light appears as a ring.  Introduction  Gravitational lensing is predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. Instead of light from a source traveling in a straight line (in three dimensions), it is bent by the presence of a massive body, which distorts spacetime. An Einstein Ring is a special case of gravitational lensing, caused by the exact alignment of the source, lens, and observer. This results in symmetry around the lens, causing a ring-like structure. The geometry of a complete Einstein ring, as caused by a gravitational lens The size of an Einstein ring is given by the Einstein radius. In radians, it is :\\\\theta_1 = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4GM}{c^2}\\\\;\\\\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S D_L}}, where : G is the gravitational constant, : M is the mass of the lens, : c is the speed of light, : D_L is the angular diameter distance to the lens, : D_S is the angular diameter distance to the source, and : D_{LS} is the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source. Over cosmological distances D_{LS} e D_S-D_L in general.  History  ALMA. The bending of light by a gravitational body was predicted by Albert Einstein in 1912, a few years before the publication of general relativity in 1916 (Renn et al. 1997). The ring effect was first mentioned in the academic literature by Orest Khvolson in a short article in 1924, in which he mentioned the ‚Äúhalo effect‚Äù of gravitation when the source, lens, and observer are in near-perfect alignment. Einstein remarked upon this effect in 1936 in a paper prompted by a letter by a Czech engineer, R W Mandl , but stated (In this statement, Œ≤ is the Einstein Radius currently denoted by \\\\theta_1, as in the expression above.) However, Einstein was only considering the chance of observing Einstein rings produced by stars, which is low ‚Äì the chance of observing those produced by larger lenses such as galaxies or black holes is higher since the angular size of an Einstein ring increases with the mass of the lens. The first complete Einstein ring, designated B1938+666, was discovered by collaboration between astronomers at the University of Manchester and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 1998. There have apparently not been any observations of a star forming an Einstein ring with another star, but there is a 45% chance of this happening in early May, 2028 when Alpha Centauri A passes between us and a distant red star. = Known Einstein rings = \\"Smiley\\" or \\"Cheshire Cat\\" image of galaxy cluster (SDSS J1038+4849) and gravitational lensing (an \\"Einstein ring\\") discovered by an international team of scientists, imaged with HST. Hundreds of gravitational lenses are currently known. About half a dozen of them are partial Einstein rings with diameters up to an arcsecond, although as either the mass distribution of the lenses is not perfectly axially symmetrical, or the source, lens, and observer are not perfectly aligned, we have yet to see a perfect Einstein ring. Most rings have been discovered in the radio range. The degree of completeness needed for an image seen through a gravitational lens to qualify as an Einstein ring is yet to be defined. The first Einstein ring was discovered by Hewitt et al. (1988), who observed the radio source MG1131+0456 using the Very Large Array. This observation saw a quasar lensed by a nearer galaxy into two separate but very similar images of the same object, the images stretched round the lens into an almost complete ring. These dual images are another possible effect of the source, lens, and observer not being perfectly aligned. The first complete Einstein ring to be discovered was B1938+666, which was found by King et al. (1998) via optical follow-up with the Hubble Space Telescope of a gravitational lens imaged with MERLIN. The galaxy causing the lens at B1938+666 is an ancient elliptical galaxy, and the image we see through the lens is a dark dwarf satellite galaxy, which we would otherwise not be able to see with current technology. In 2005, the combined power of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with the Hubble Space Telescope was used in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey to find 19 new gravitational lenses, 8 of which showed Einstein rings, these are the 8 shown in the adjacent image. As of 2009 this survey has found 85 confirmed gravitational lenses, there is not yet a number for how many show Einstein rings. This survey is responsible for most of the recent discoveries of Einstein rings in the optical range, following are some examples which were found: *FOR J0332-3557, discovered by Remi Cabanac et al. in 2005, notable for its high redshift which allows us to use it to make observations about the early universe. *The \\"Cosmic Horseshoe\\" is a partial Einstein ring which was observed through the gravitational lens of LRG 3-757, a distinctively large Luminous Red Galaxy. It was discovered in 2007 by V. Belokurov et al. *SDSSJ0946+1006, the \\"double Einstein ring\\" was discovered by Raphael Gavazzi and Tomasso Treu in 2008, notable for the presence of multiple rings observed through the same gravitational lens, the significance of which is explained in the next section on extra rings. Another example is the radio/X-Ray Einstein ring around PKS 1830-211, which is unusually strong in radio. It was discovered in X-Ray by Varsha Gupta et al. at the Chandra X-Ray observatory It is also notable for being the first case of a quasar being lensed by an almost face-on spiral galaxy. There is also a radio ring around galaxy MG1654+1346, the image in the ring is that of a quasar radio lobe, discovered in 1989 by G.Langston et al.  Extra rings  SDSSJ0946+1006 is a Double Einstein Ring. Credit: HST/NASA/ESA Using the Hubble Space Telescope, a double ring has been found by Raphael Gavazzi of the STScI and Tommaso Treu of the University of California, Santa Barbara. This arises from the light from three galaxies at distances of 3, 6, and 11 billion light years. Such rings help in understanding the distribution of dark matter, dark energy, the nature of distant galaxies, and the curvature of the universe. The odds of finding such a double ring are 1 in 10,000. Sampling 50 suitable double rings would provide astronomers with a more accurate measurement of the dark matter content of the universe and the equation of state of the dark energy to within 10 percent precision. = A simulation = Below in the Gallery section is a simulation depicting a zoom on a Schwarzschild black hole in the plane of the Milky Way between us and the centre of the galaxy. The first Einstein ring is to the most distorted region of the picture and shows the galactic disc. The zoom then reveals a series of 4 extra rings, increasingly thinner and closer to the black hole shadow. They are multiple images of the galactic disk. The first and third correspond to points which are behind the black hole (from the observer's position) and correspond here to the bright yellow region of the galactic disc (close to the galactic center), whereas the second and fourth correspond to images of objects which are behind the observer, which appear bluer since the corresponding part of the galactic disc is thinner and hence dimmer here.

Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone. Fifth Printing (August 2001) page 251. The product cipher combines a sequence of simple transformations such as substitution (S-box), permutation (P-box), and modular arithmetic. The concept of product ciphers is due to Claude Shannon, who presented the idea in his foundational paper, Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems. For transformation involving reasonable number of n message symbols, both of the foregoing cipher systems (the S-box and P-box) are by themselves wanting. Shannon suggested using a combination of S-box and P-box transformation‚Äîa product cipher. The combination could yield a cipher system more powerful than either one alone. This approach of alternatively applying substitution and permutation transformation has been used by IBM in the Lucifer cipher system, and has become the standard for national data encryption standards such as the Data Encryption Standard and the Advanced Encryption Standard. A product cipher that uses only substitutions and permutations is called a SP-network. Feistel ciphers are an important class of product ciphers.

The stadium is served by the University of Washington Link light rail station, which provides rail service to downtown, Rainier Valley and Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. It is also accessible by several bus routes. The stadium underwent a $280 million renovation that was completed in 2013. Its U-shaped design was specifically oriented (18.167¬∞ south of due east) to minimize glare from the early afternoon sun in the athletes' eyes. The stadium's open end overlooks Lake Washington and the Cascade Mountains, including Mount Rainier. Prior to the 2013 renovation, its total capacity of 72,500 made it the largest stadium in the Pacific Northwest and one of the largest college football stadiums. History The original stadium was built in 1920 by Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company with a seating capacity of 30,000. It replaced Denny Field, located at the north end of campus, south of NE 45th St. and 20th Ave NE. Husky Stadium's first game was the concluding game of the 1920 season, a 28‚Äì7 loss to Dartmouth on November 27. On July 27, 1923, the stadium was the site of President Warren Harding's final public address; he died in San Francisco less than a week later. The capacity of the lower bowl was expanded with the addition of 10,000 seats around the rim in 1936. In 1943, 35,000 people watched a demonstration of a mock WWII bombing raid, showing how local forces would respond in an attack. The Seattle fire department and emergency response teams rescued mock victims and buildings constructed on the field that were exploded as P-38 planes flew overhead to demonstrate how citizens should react. The first of the stadium's iconic covered grandstands was constructed in 1950, adding 15,000 seats to the south side. Several thousand additional seats were added in 1968. An aerial view of Husky Stadium as seen the day before the start of the 2011 renovation project. \\"Go Huskies\\" and the \\"W\\" logo were painted on the north and south decks in September 2008.Washington-BYU Postgame Notes In 1987, 13,000 seats were added with the construction of the north grandstand. Similar to the south stand, this structure included a cantilevered steel roof covering a portion of the lower seats. The project made headlines on February 25, 1987, when the grandstand collapsed during construction as a result of miscommunication between the workers and the contractor, which led to the premature removal during the intended replacement of several support cables. Although there were no casualties, property damage ranged from $500,000 to $1 million and resulted in setbacks.HistoryLink Essay: Husky Stadium collapses on February 25, 1987 Husky Stadium was a primary venue for the 1990 Goodwill Games, where the crowd saw an address by former President Ronald Reagan, as well as an address by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a performance by the Moody Blues & Gorky Park. The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the track & field competition. Husky Stadium was the temporary home of the Seattle Seahawks for five games (two preseason and three regular season) in 1994 while the Kingdome was temporarily closed for repairs to its damaged roof. After the demolition of the Kingdome in March 2000, the Seahawks played at Husky Stadium for the 2000 and 2001 seasons before moving into Seahawks Stadium (now CenturyLink Field) in 2002. The playing field at Husky Stadium was originally dirt, which was then replaced with natural grass in 1938. In 1968, Washington became one of the first major college teams to play on AstroTurf at home; at the time, the Houston Astrodome, Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin, were the only other major facilities with artificial turf. The AstroTurf field was replaced in 1972, 1977, 1987, and 1995. FieldTurf, a new variation of synthetic turf, was installed in 2000 at a cost of $1,074,958. The new turf features enhanced drainage and reduced abrasion through the use of synthetic fibers that are tufted into an infill of sand and rubber. The project was funded by Seattle Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who used Husky Stadium as a temporary home venue during the construction of CenturyLink Field. The first of its kind in the NFL, the surface was so popular with the players that the Seahawks, who had planned to use natural grass at their new stadium, instead installed their own FieldTurf surface. The FieldTurf at Husky Stadium was replaced with a newer one after nine seasons in 2009 at a cost of $350,000. Union Bay In addition to the new playing surface, the Seahawks made other improvements to Husky stadium in preparation for its tenure as an NFL venue for two seasons. A larger scoreboard debuted in 1998, with a \\"HuskyTron\\" video screen. Improved lighting for television, including corner lights, was added in 1999, and official NFL goalposts (optic yellow, in height) were installed in 2000. The Husky Stadium end zones were painted gold during the 1980s and early 1990s; the new AstroTurf in 1995 changed them to purple. They became natural green with the installation of FieldTurf in 2000, which lasted until 2009 when they reverted to gold for one season. Purple end zones returned prior the 2010 season, and were temporarily painted black for the Huskies' first \\"blackout\\" game against UCLA on November 18. On September 3, 2015, Alaska Airlines purchased naming rights to the field, which changed its official name to \\"Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium.\\" The agreement, worth $41 million over 10 years, became the largest of its kind in college athletics. =The Wave= Pre-renovation in 2009, looking south; Downtown and Space Needle at top right Many claim that the first audience wave originated in Husky Stadium on Halloween 1981, at the prompting of Husky band trumpeter Dave Hunter. Contrary to Hunter's account, former Washington yell leader Robb Weller has also claimed credit for the first wave. Weller was the guest yell-king during the Huskies' homecoming football game against Stanford. His initial concept for the wave was for it to travel vertically, from the bottom of the stands to the top, within the Husky student section. When the stunt was met with limited interest, he then decided to reverse the movement of the wave to travel from top to bottom. This failed miserably, as it was necessary to turn backward to see the wave progressing downward. Weller then gave up and returned his attention to the game. However, a fan named Omar Parker sitting on the open (east) end of the stadium at the student side started yelling \\"sideways\\". Weller did not hear him, but then many students tried to initiate a \\"sideways\\" wave on their own. After a few attempts, and more yelling of \\"sideways\\" by students, Weller took notice. He instructed the crowd to stand as he ran past. He moved along the track toward the open end of the stadium, explaining to the student crowd what he would do, then ran along the track toward the closed end of the stadium, in front of the student section. The stunt caught on after a couple of tries and continued around the entire stadium, and was then repeated throughout the rest of the game and the season. Longtime UW band director Bill Bissell also claimed co-creator credit with Weller, suggesting that the wave was devised by both of them prior to the game. The following week Bill Scott (known as \\"Bill the Beer Man\\") started the wave in Husky Stadium and also at the Seattle Seahawks game in the Kingdome. =Loudness= Capacity crowd in the south stands at the 100th Apple Cup in 2007 Husky Stadium has long been recognized as one of the loudest stadiums in the nation. This is in part due to the stadium's design; almost 70% of the seats are located between the end zones, covered by cantilevered metal roofs that trap the sound.Husky Stadium listing at official Huskies athletic site On occasion, the high decibel levels at Husky games along with fans stomping their feet in the bleachers cause television cameras to shake. During the night game against #12 Nebraska on September 19, 1992, ESPN measured the noise level at over 130 decibels, well above the threshold of pain. The maximum recorded level of 133.6 decibels, according to ESPN, is the highest ever recorded at a college football stadium. =Tailgating= The north and south parking lots are packed with cars for tailgating. Husky Stadium is unusual in that fans can travel to football games by boat, known locally as \\"sailgating\\" (other stadiums with this feature include Neyland Stadium at Tennessee, Heinz Field at Pittsburgh, and McLane Stadium at Baylor). There can be upwards of 12,000 people out on Lake Washington next to Husky Stadium during game days.Tim Booth AP Sports Writer Before kickoff, the Washington crew team offers shuttles to anyone that wants to go to and from the boats and docks for the game.IdahoStatesman.com Fans also gather at the Dempsey Indoor Facility just north of the stadium for Husky Huddles. After the game, the Tyee Sports Council and the University of Washington Athletic Department put on events where fans can gather and hear analysis of the game from Washington coaches and Husky Legends, and listen to the Husky Marching Band. =2011‚Äì2013 renovation= Renovation in April 2012 Photo from student section in West endzone during Husky game in September 2019 Husky Stadium had developed numerous structural problems over the years as a result of standing for nine decades in Seattle's moist weather, particularly in the lower bowl. In November 2011, Husky Stadium began a $261 million renovation, the largest single capital project in the university's history. Home games were played at CenturyLink Field during the 2012 season while construction took place. The Apple Cup in 2011 was moved to CenturyLink (Qwest Field through 2011) to advance the start of the project by several weeks. The new Husky Stadium was developed by Wright Runstad & Company, designed by 360 Architecture, and constructed by Turner Construction company. The steel decking was supplied by Profile Steel. The new stadium is the first and primary income source of a completely remodeled athletic district which includes a new $19 million Husky Ballpark, a new track and field stadium, renovated soccer stadium, $50 million basketball operations and practice facility and recently completed projects such as the Husky Legends Center, the Conibear Shellhouse and Alaska Airlines Arena renovations, and the construction of the Dempsey Indoor facility. This major remodel of the athletic village coincided with construction for an underground station for a northern extension of the Link Light Rail system and a replacement of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge. The renovation project incorporated a new grand concourse, press box, video and audio system, and football offices, as well as new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms. The track that had enclosed the playing field was removed, and the field itself lowered by four feet to make room for additional seating closer to the sidelines. The student section was relocated from the north sideline to the west end zone, and the temporary bleachers in the east end zone were replaced with a permanent structure featuring field-level suites. The addition of box suites reduced the seating capacity from 72,500 to 70,138.\\"Husky Stadium to debut after $280M renovation\\". USA Today. Associated Press. August 29, 2013. Retrieved September 1, 2013. Despite the reduction in capacity, the renovated stadium is expected to be as loud as its predecessor.Gall, Braden Ranking the Pac-12's College Football Stadiums. Athlon Sports, 2013-06-13. Additionally, new parking garages were constructed and facilities throughout the athletic village were renovated. NFL exhibition games Before the arrival of the Seattle Seahawks between 1955 and 1975, Husky Stadium hosted 12 NFL preseason games. The San Francisco 49ers played six times at the stadium, the most of any team. Other teams to make multiple appearances include the New York Giants, Los Angeles Rams, Cleveland Browns, and Chicago/St. Louis Cardinals. At one point after the 1970 NFL season, Ralph Wilson came close to moving the Buffalo Bills from dilapidated War Memorial Stadium to Husky Stadium. The threat of relocation prompted the developers in the Buffalo suburbs to construct Rich Stadium in Orchard Park (later Ralph Wilson Stadium and now New Era Field), which opened in 1973. The Bills have resided there ever since.

These cells have the ability to spontaneously produce an electrical impulse (action potential; see below for more details), that travels through the heart via the electrical conduction system (see figure 1) causing it to contract. In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potential, setting the rhythm of the heart and so is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The rate of action potential production (and therefore the heart rate) is influenced by nerves that supply it. Structure The sinoatrial node is a banana-shaped structure that varies in size, usually between 10-30 millimeters (mm) long, 5‚Äì7 mm wide, and 1‚Äì2 mm deep. =Location= The SA node is located in the wall (myocardium) of the right atrium, laterally to the entrance of the superior vena cava in a region called the sinus venarum (hence sino- + atrial). It is positioned roughly between a groove called the crista terminalis located on the internal surface of the heart and the corresponding sulcus terminalis, on the external surface. These grooves run between the entrance of the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. =Microanatomy= stained image of the SA node (center-right on image) and its surrounding tissue. The SA node surrounds the sinoatrial nodal artery, seen as the open lumen. Cardiac muscle cells of the right atrium can be seen to the left of the node, and fat tissue to the right. The cells of the SA node are spread out within a mesh of connective tissue, containing nerves, blood vessels, collagen and fat. Immediately surrounding the SA node cells are paranodal cells. These cells have structures intermediate between that of the SA node cells and the rest of the atrium. The connective tissue, along with the paranodal cells, insulate the SA node from the rest of the atrium, preventing the electrical activity of the atrial cells from affecting the SA node cells. The SA node cells are smaller and paler than the surrounding atrial cells, with the average cell being around 8 micrometers in diameter and 20-30 micrometers in length (1 micrometer= 0.000001 meter). Unlike the atrial cells, SA node cells contain fewer mitochondria (the power plant of the cell), fewer myofibers (the contractile machinery of the cell), and a smaller sarcoplasmic reticulum (a calcium storage organelle that releases calcium for contraction). This means that the SA node cells are less equipped to contract compared to the atrial and ventricular cells. Action potentials pass from one cardiac cell to the next through pores known as gap junctions. These gap junctions are made of proteins called connexins. There are fewer gap junctions within the SA node and they are smaller in size. This is again important in insulating the SA node from the surrounding atrial cells. =Blood supply= The sinoatrial node receives its blood supply from the sinoatrial nodal artery. This blood supply, however, can differ hugely between individuals. For example, in most humans, this is a single artery, although in some cases there have been either 2 or 3 sinoatrial node arteries supplying the SA node. Also, the SA node artery mainly originates as a branch of the right coronary artery; however in some individuals it has arisen from the circumflex artery, which is a branch of the left coronary artery. Finally, the SA node artery commonly passes behind the superior vena cava, before reaching the SA node; however in some instances it passes in front. Despite these many differences, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any advantage to how many sinoatrial nodal arteries an individual has, or where they originate =Venous drainage= There are no large veins that drain blood away from the SA node. Instead, smaller venules drain the blood directly into the right atrium. Function =Pacemaking= The main role of a sinoatrial node cell is to initiate action potentials of the heart that can pass through cardiac muscle cells and cause contraction. An action potential is a rapid change in membrane potential, produced by the movement of charged atoms (ions). In the absence of stimulation, non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a relatively constant membrane potential; this is known as a resting potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when an action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential, known as depolarization, which is propagated throughout the heart and initiates muscle contraction. Pacemaker cells, however, do not have a resting potential. Instead, immediately after repolarization, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, a phenomenon known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, the threshold potential, it produces an action potential. Other cells within the heart (including the Purkinje fibers and atrioventricular node) can also initiate action potentials; however, they do so at a slower rate and therefore, if the SA node is functioning properly, its action potentials usually override those that would be produced by other tissues. Outlined below are the 3 phases of a sinoatrial node action potential. In the cardiac action potential, there are 5 phases (labelled 0-4), however pacemaker action potentials do not have an obvious phase 1 or 2. Phase 4 Figure 3: Sinoatrial node action potential waveform, outlining major ion currents involved (downward deflection indicates ions moving into the cell, upwards deflection indicates ions flowing out of the cell). This phase is also known as the pacemaker potential. Immediately following repolarization, when the membrane potential is very negative (it is hyperpolarised), the voltage slowly begins to increase. This is initially due to the closing of potassium channels, which reduces the flow of potassium ions (Ik) out of the cell (see phase 2, below). Hyperpolarization also causes activation of hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide‚Äìgated (HCN) channels. The activation of ion channels at very negative membrane potentials is unusual, therefore the flow of sodium (Na+) and some K+ through the activated HCN channel is referred to as a funny current (If). This funny current causes the membrane potential of the cell to gradually increase, as the positive charge (Na+ and K+) is flowing into the cell. Another mechanism involved in pacemaker potential is known as the calcium clock. This refers to the spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (a calcium store) into the cytoplasm, also known as calcium sparks. This increase in calcium within the cell then activates a sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX), which removes one Ca2+ from the cell, and exchanges it for 3 Na+ into the cell (therefore removing a charge of +2 from the cell, but allowing a charge of +3 to enter the cell) further increasing the membrane potential. Calcium later reenters the cell via SERCA and calcium channels located on the cell membrane. The increase in membrane potential produced by these mechanisms, activates T-type calcium channels and then L-type calcium channels (which open very slowly). These channels allow a flow of Ca2+ into the cell, making the membrane potential even more positive. Phase 0 This is the depolarization phase. When the membrane potential reaches the threshold potential (around -20 to -50 mV), the cell begins to rapidly depolarise (become more positive).Verkerk, A., Borren, van, Peters, R., Broekhuis, E., Lam, K., Coronel, R., Bakker, de, Tan, H. and Wilders, R. (2007) 'Single cells isolated from human sinoatrial node: Action potentials and numerical reconstruction of pacemaker current‚Äô, Conference proceedings : ... Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual Conference., 2007, pp. 904‚Äì7. This is mainly due to the flow of Ca2+ through L-type calcium channels, which are now fully open. During this stage, T-type calcium channels and HCN channels deactivate. Phase 3 This phase is the repolarization phase. This occurs due to the inactivation of L-type calcium channels (preventing the movement of Ca2+ into the cell) and the activation of potassium channels, which allows the flow of K+ out of the cell, making the membrane potential more negative. Nerve supply Heart rate depends on the rate at which the sinoatrial node produces action potentials. At rest, heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. This is a result of the activity of two sets of nerves, one acting to slow down action potential production (these are parasympathetic nerves) and the other acting to speed up action potential production (sympathetic nerves). The sympathetic nerves begin in the thoracic region of the spinal cord (in particular T1-T4). These nerves release a neurotransmitter called noradrenaline (NA). This binds to a receptor on the SA node membrane, called a beta-1adrenoceptor. Binding of NA to this receptor activates a G-protein (in particular a Gs-Protein, S for stimulatory) which initiates a series of reactions (known as the cAMP pathway) that results in the production of a molecule called cyclic adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP). This cAMP binds to the HCN channel (see above). Binding of cAMP to the HCN, increases the flow of Na+ and K+ into the cell, speeding up the pacemaker potential, so producing action potentials at a quicker rate, and increasing heart rate.Larsson, P.H. (2010) 'How is the heart rate regulated in the sinoatrial node? Another piece to the puzzle‚Äô, 136(3). An increase in heart rate is known as positive chronotropy. The parasympathetic nerves supplying the SA node (in particular the Vagus nerves) originate in the brain. These nerves release a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to a receptor called an M2 muscarinic receptor, located on the SA node membrane. Activation of this M2 receptor, then activates a protein called a G-protein (in particular Gi protein, i for inhibitory). Activation of this G-protein, blocks the cAMP pathway, reducing its effects, therefore inhibiting sympathetic activity and slowing action potential production. As well as this, the G-protein also activates a potassium channel, which allows K+ to flow out of the cell, making the membrane potential more negative and slowing the pacemaker potential, therefore decreasing the rate of action potential production and therefore decreasing heart rate.Osterried-er W., Noma A., Trautwein W. (1980) On the kinetics of the potassium current activated by acetylcholine in the SA node of the rabbit heart. Pfl√ºgers Arch. 386:101‚Äì109. A decrease in heart rate is known as negative chronotropy. The first cell to produce the action potential in the SA node isn‚Äôt always the same: this is known as pacemaker shift. In certain species of animals‚Äîfor example, in dogs‚Äîa superior shift (i.e. the cell that produces the fastest action potential in the SA node is higher than previously) usually produces an increased heart rate whereas an inferior shift (i.e. the cell producing the fastest action potential within the SA node is further down than previously) produces a decreased heart rate. Clinical significance Sinus node dysfunction describes an irregular heartbeat caused by faulty electrical signals of the heart. When the heart's sinoatrial node is defective, the heart‚Äôs rhythms become abnormal ‚Äì typically too slow or exhibiting pauses in its function or a combination, and very rarely faster than normal.Sinus node dysfunction Mount Sinai Hospital, New York Blockage of the arterial blood supply to the SA node (most commonly due to a myocardial infarction or progressive coronary artery disease) can therefore cause ischaemia and cell death in the SA node. This can disrupt the electrical pacemaker function of the SA node, and can result in sick sinus syndrome. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. History The sinoatrial node was first discovered by a young medical student, Martin Flack, in the heart of a mole, whilst his mentor, Sir Arthur Keith, was on a bicycle ride with his wife. They made the discovery in a makeshift laboratory set up in a farmhouse in Kent, England, called Mann's Place. Their discovery was published in 1907.

A left-handed pitcher, Gomez played in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1930 and 1943 for the New York Yankees and the Washington Senators. Gomez was a five-time World Series champion with the Yankees. He was also known for his colorful personality and humor throughout his career and life. Gomez grew up in California and played for the San Francisco Seals after high school. He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in April 1930. He was selected as an All-Star every year between 1933 and 1939. He sustained an arm injury in 1940. Though he rebounded well in 1941, he pitched his last full season in 1942, then appeared in one game in 1943 before retiring with the Washington Senators. In 1933, Gomez married June O'Dea, who had a brief career as a Broadway actress. After his retirement, he became a popular public speaker. Gomez was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1972. He made an appearance at Yankee Stadium in 1987, when he and Whitey Ford were honored with plaques at the stadium's Monument Park. He died in California in 1989. Early life Gomez was born in Rodeo, California. His father, Francisco Gomez, had been born in California to a Spanish father, Juan Gomez, and a Portuguese mother, Rita. His mother, Lizzie Herring, was an American of Welsh-Irish descent. He played sandlot baseball in Oakland while attending Richmond High School and was recruited by the San Francisco Seals. The New York Yankees purchased Gomez from the Seals for an estimated $39,000. A memorial plaque dedicated to Lefty Gomez at the Lefty Gomez Field in Rodeo along with a cement impression of his left hand dated 11/22/1932 can be seen at 470 Parker Ave, Rodeo, CA 94572.

Career Gomez's 1933 Goudey baseball card Gomez made his major league debut on April 29, 1930. He pitched in only 15 games and finished the season with a 2-5 win-loss record, a 5.55 earned run average (ERA). Coming into the 1931 season, Gomez had good pitching velocity, but the Yankees were concerned about the pitcher's slender frame of and . Following a common medical strategy of the time, the team had most of his teeth extracted; they also had him drink three quarts of milk daily and gave him an unlimited meal allowance for road games. Gomez registered the second-best ERA in the American League in 1931. A 20-game winner four times and an All-Star every year from 1933 to 1939, Gomez led the league twice each in wins, winning percentage and ERA; he was a three-time league leader in shutouts and strikeouts. In the first major league All-Star Game (July 6, 1933), Gomez was the winning pitcher for the American League (AL) and drove in the first run of the game. This was out of character for him; he was notorious for poor hitting even by AL standards. Late in life, Gomez commented, \\"I never even broke a bat until last year when I was backing out of the garage.\\" His career OPS+ of -7 is the fifth-worst in baseball history among players with at least 1,000 plate appearances. Gomez holds the record for the most innings pitched in a single All-Star game (six, in 1934). Lefty's best season came in 1934, when he won 26 games and lost just five. In both 1934 and 1937, he won pitching's \\"Triple Crown\\" by leading the league in wins, ERA and strikeouts; he also led the AL both seasons in shutouts. His .649 career winning percentage ranks 15th in major league history among pitchers with 200 or more decisions. Among pitchers who made their MLB debuts from 1900 to 1950, only Lefty Grove, Christy Mathewson and Whitey Ford have both more victories and a higher winning percentage than Gomez. Gomez won six World Series games without a loss, a career World Series record. He won a World Series game in 1932, two in 1936, two in 1937 and one in 1938. He also set a World Series record by receiving two walks in the same inning on October 6, 1937. Nicknamed \\"El Goofo\\" and \\"Goofy Gomez\\", he was known for his sense of humor, even on the field. In one game, he came up to bat when it was slightly foggy. Bob Feller was on the mound and Gomez struck a match before stepping into the batter's box. \\"What's the big idea?\\" asked the umpire. \\"Do you think that match will help you see Feller's fast one?\\" Gomez replied, \\"No, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to make sure he can see me!\\" Another time, a reporter asked the noted brushback pitcher, \\"Is it true that you'd throw at your own mother?\\" Gomez replied, \\"You're damn right I would. She's a good hitter.\\" Gomez also often remarked, \\"I'd rather be lucky than good.\\" In 1940, Gomez suffered an arm injury, which left him up for grabs by another team, but in 1941 he played fairly well, winning 15 and losing 5. During that season, he was said to be a great starting pitcher, but won through the support of Johnny Murphy, who relieved him in later innings. After the 1942 season ended, Gomez took a job as a dispatcher with the General Electric River Works, a defense plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, which only paid $40 a week. Then on January 27, 1943, the Yankees sold him to the Boston Braves for $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Gomez never appeared in a game with the Braves, as later in the year he was released from his contract and signed with the Washington Senators. He pitched just one game ‚Äï on May 30, 1943, allowing four hits, four runs and walking five men ‚Äï before pulling a shoulder muscle in the fifth inning and retiring from baseball. He had a 189‚Äì102 career record with 1,468 strikeouts and a 3.34 ERA in 2,503 innings pitched. Marriage On February 26, 1933, Gomez married June O‚ÄôDea (1912‚Äì1992). A Broadway headliner who starred in Of Thee I Sing, she gave up her career in 1936. By 1937 the marriage was on shaky ground. Gomez traveled to Hollywood that April and June returned to Massachusetts to stay with family. Through the tabloids, she learned in December that Gomez was filing divorce papers in Mexico, charging incompatibility. Being a devout Catholic, June refused a divorce but agreed to a formal separation, citing abandonment and cruel and inhuman treatment. Publicly, Gomez said the whole idea of divorce was absurd, but after the first of the year he moved to Reno to get a six-week divorce. It was his intention for the divorce to be finalized by the time he began spring training in Florida. Separation proceedings continued for months, but were called off in May 1938. Gomez and O'Dea had two daughters and two sons. After baseball In retirement, Gomez became a sought-after dinner speaker known for his humorous anecdotes about his playing days and the personalities he knew. He was a bit of a screwball, nicknamed \\"El Goofo\\" or \\"Goofy Gomez\\" (a likewise-alliterative counterpart to his contemporary, Dizzy Dean), and delighted in playing practical jokes on everyone from teammates to umpires. On February 2, 1972, the Veterans Committee unanimously inducted Gomez into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, along with Giants outfielder Ross Youngs and former American League President Will Harridge. The Committee noted that Lefty pitched in seven World Series games with no losses and five wins. Wearing a Yankee cap, Gomez became the second player of Hispanic descent to be inducted. The 1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Gomez as he was the last surviving player from the 1933 All-Star Game. He also threw out the ceremonial first pitch. On August 2, 1987, he and Whitey Ford were honored with plaques to be placed in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Gomez's plaque says he was \\"Noted for his wit and his fastball, as he was fast with a quip and a pitch.\\" Despite advancing age, he was able to attend the ceremony. Although he was honored with the plaque, his uniform #11 has not been retired, and has since been worn by several Yankees including Joe Page, Johnny Sain, H√©ctor L√≥pez, Fred Stanley, Dwight Gooden, Chuck Knoblauch, Gary Sheffield, Doug Mientkiewicz, and Brett Gardner. Gomez spent the last years of his life in Novato, California; he died of congestive heart failure on February 17, 1989, in Marin General Hospital in Larkspur, California. A decade later, he was ranked #73 on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

This increase in membrane potential is what causes the cell membrane, which typically maintains a resting membrane potential of -70 mV, to reach the threshold potential and consequently fire the next action potential; thus, the pacemaker potential is what drives the self-generated rhythmic firing (automaticity) of pacemaker cells, and the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the pacemaker potential is what determines the timing of the next action potential and thus the intrinsic firing rate of the cell. In a healthy sinoatrial node (SAN, a complex tissue within the right atrium containing pacemaker cells that normally determine the intrinsic firing rate for the entire heart), the pacemaker potential is the main determinant of the heart rate. Because the pacemaker potential represents the non-contracting time between heart beats (diastole), it is also called the diastolic depolarization. The amount of net inward current required to move the cell membrane potential during the pacemaker phase is extremely small, in the order of few pAs, but this net flux arises from time to time changing contribution of several currents that flow with different voltage and time dependence. Evidence in support of the active presence of K+, Ca2+, Na+ channels and Na+/K+ exchanger during the pacemaker phase have been variously reported in the literature, but several indications point to the ‚Äúfunny‚Äù(If) current as one of the most important.(see funny current). There is now substantial evidence that also sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-transients participate to the generation of the diastolic depolarization via a process involving the Na‚ÄìCa exchanger. The rhythmic activity of some neurons like the pre-B√∂tzinger complex is modulated by neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, and such modulatory connectivity gives to the neurons the necessary plasticity to generating distinctive, state-dependent rhythmic patterns that depend on pacemarker potentials. Distinctions among autonomic foci In reality, the heart has several pacemakers known as autonomic foci, each which fires at its own intrinsic rate: * SA node: 60‚Äì100 bpm * Atrial foci: 60‚Äì80 bpm * Junctional foci: 40‚Äì60 bpm * Ventricular foci: 20‚Äì40 bpm The potentials will normally travel in order SA node ‚Üí atrial foci ‚Üí junctional foci ‚Üí ventricular foci Pacemaker potentials are fired not only by SA node, but also by the other foci. However, the other firing frequencies are slower than the one of the SA node (as seen above). Normally, all the foci will end up firing at the SA node rate, not their intrinsic rate. The other foci attempt to fire at their intrinsic rate, but they are activated by the SA node before they can fire. This rapid firing causes all the foci to fire faster than their intrinsic rates, a phenomenon known as overdrive-suppression. Thus, in the normal, healthy heart, only the SA node intrinsic rate is observable. Pathology However, in pathological conditions, the intrinsic rate becomes apparent. Consider a heart attack which damages the region of the heart between the SA node and the atrial foci. SA node ‚Üí block atrial foci ‚Üí junctional foci ‚Üí ventricular foci The other foci will not see the SA node firing; however, they will see the atrial foci. The heart will now beat at the intrinsic rate of the atrial foci. Induction The firing of the pacemaker cells is induced electrically by reaching the threshold potential of the cell membrane. The threshold potential is the potential an excitable cell membrane, such as a myocyte, must reach in order to induce an action potential. This depolarization is caused by very small net inward currents of calcium ions across the cell membrane, which gives rise to the action potential. Bio-pacemakers Bio-pacemakers are the outcome of a rapidly emerging field of research into a replacement for the electronic pacemaker. The bio-pacemaker turns quiescent myocardial cells (e.g. atrial cells) into pacemaker cells. This is achieved by making the cells express a gene which creates a pacemaker current.

He is the creator and executive producer of the Emmy Award-winning television series Monk on the USA Network, and is co-host of WFMU radio's long-running conceptual comedy program Seven Second Delay. He has written screenplays for a number of comedy films including Sgt. Bilko (starring Steve Martin) and Rat Race (directed by Jerry Zucker), and is frequently hired as a \\"script doctor\\" to inject humorous content into scripts written by other screenwriters. Television work Breckman wrote for Late Night with David Letterman from 1982 to 1984, and contributed sketches to Saturday Night Live from 1983 to 1996. One of his most well-known vignettes was a Saturday Night Live sketch called \\"White Like Me\\" (which he also directed), in which Eddie Murphy disguises himself as a Caucasian for a day. In 2003 he served as a jokewriter for comedian Steve Martin's stint as host of the Academy Awards. Breckman's biggest success, Monk, was a murder-mystery with a humorous edge. Breckman told New Jersey Monthly that he was a voracious reader of the works of Arthur Conan Doyle, John D. MacDonald, and other authors of ‚Äúsolvable‚Äù mysteries, as well as being a big fan of the TV series Columbo. ‚ÄúIn a way, it‚Äôs similar to comedy writing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs puzzles and puzzle solving. Very logical.‚Äù In August 2009, USA Network launched Little Monk, a spinoff series that portrays the main character, detective Adrian Monk, as a child. Breckman was part of the show's team of writers. He wrote seven episodes of the 2000-2001 Comedy Central series TV Funhouse, and in 2015 wrote \\"Dog Show\\" for The Jack and Triumph Show. In July 2016 he was part of a team of writers for Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog's coverage of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The Good Cop, another humorous murder-mystery series created and written by Breckman, debuted on Netflix in September 2018. (It ran for ten episodes before being cancelled.) The show starred Tony Danza as Tony Caruso, Sr., \\"a disgraced, former NYPD officer who never followed the rules,\\" and Josh Groban as his son, Tony \\"T.J.\\" Caruso, Jr., a squeaky-clean homicide detective. About the series, Breckman said, \\"Many cop shows feature dark and provocative material: psycho-sexual killers, twisted, grim, flawed detectives.

Radio Since 1992, Breckman and WFMU station manager Ken Freedman have co-hosted a weekly one-hour comedy call-in radio program, Seven Second Delay. The premise of the program seems to be a never- ending series of dead-on-arrival concepts, with the comedic value hinging on Breckman's recurring acknowledgment of failure and his desire to go home as quickly as possible. Breckman has described his co-host as \\"a sad, bitter little man and [WFMU's] fundraisers are a good time to humiliate him and exploit his willingness to do just about anything, including prostituting himself, to raise money for his adorable little public hippy noise radio station.\\" From 2009 to 2012, Seven Second Delay broadcast remotely from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater comedy club in Manhattan. In 2011 the UCB shows went bi-weekly. Guests on the program included Dick Cavett, Joe Franklin, Amy Sedaris, Peter Stampfel, Jules Feiffer, Andrew VanWyngarden (of the band MGMT), Dan Okrent, Nora Ephron, Wallace Shawn, Jim Downey, and numerous other celebrities with whom Breckman is familiar, as well as lesser- known fringe figures, whom Breckman ridiculed on the air for not being well- known celebrities. In 1998, Gadfly Records released Death-Defying Radio Stunts, a CD of outrageous moments from Seven Second Delay studio broadcasts.

A schematic view of an idealized action potential illustrates its various phases as the action potential passes a point on a cell membrane. B. Actual recordings of action potentials are often distorted compared to the schematic view because of variations in electrophysiological techniques used to make the recording. In electrophysiology, the threshold potential is the critical level to which a membrane potential must be depolarized to initiate an action potential. In neuroscience, threshold potentials are necessary to regulate and propagate signaling in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Most often, the threshold potential is a membrane potential value between ‚Äì50 and ‚Äì55 mV, but can vary based upon several factors. A neuron's resting membrane potential (‚Äì70 mV) can be altered to either increase or decrease likelihood of reaching threshold via sodium and potassium ions. An influx of sodium into the cell through open, voltage-gated sodium channels can depolarize the membrane past threshold and thus excite it while an efflux of potassium or influx of chloride can hyperpolarize the cell and thus inhibit threshold from being reached. Discovery Initial experiments revolved around the concept that any electrical change that is brought about in neurons must occur through the action of ions. The German physical chemist Walther Nernst applied this concept in experiments to discover nervous excitability, and concluded that the local excitatory process through a semi-permeable membrane depends upon the ionic concentration. Also, ion concentration was shown to be the limiting factor in excitation. If the proper concentration of ions was attained, excitation would certainly occur. This was the basis for discovering the threshold value. Along with reconstructing the action potential in the 1950s, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley were also able to experimentally determine the mechanism behind the threshold for excitation. It is known as the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model. Through use of voltage clamp techniques on a squid giant axon, they discovered that excitable tissues generally exhibit the phenomenon that a certain membrane potential must be reached in order to fire an action potential. Since the experiment yielded results through the observation of ionic conductance changes, Hodgkin and Huxley used these terms to discuss the threshold potential. They initially suggested that there must be a discontinuity in the conductance of either sodium or potassium, but in reality both conductances tended to vary smoothly along with the membrane potential. They soon discovered that at threshold potential, the inward and outward currents, of sodium and potassium ions respectively, were exactly equal and opposite. As opposed to the resting membrane potential, the threshold potential's conditions exhibited a balance of currents that were unstable. Instability refers to the fact that any further depolarization activates even more voltage-gated sodium channels, and the incoming sodium depolarizing current overcomes the delayed outward current of potassium. At resting level, on the other hand, the potassium and sodium currents are equal and opposite in a stable manner, where a sudden, continuous flow of ions should not result. The basis is that at a certain level of depolarization, when the currents are equal and opposite in an unstable manner, any further entry of positive charge generates an action potential. This specific value of depolarization (in mV) is otherwise known as the threshold potential. Physiological function and characteristics The threshold value controls whether or not the incoming stimuli are sufficient to generate an action potential. It relies on a balance of incoming inhibitory and excitatory stimuli. The potentials generated by the stimuli are additive, and they may reach threshold depending on their frequency and amplitude. Normal functioning of the central nervous system entails a summation of synaptic inputs made largely onto a neuron's dendritic tree. These local graded potentials, which are primarily associated with external stimuli, reach the axon initial segment and build until they manage to reach the threshold value. The larger the stimulus, the greater the depolarization, or attempt to reach threshold. The task of depolarization requires several key steps that rely on anatomical factors of the cell. The ion conductances involved depend on the membrane potential and also the time after the membrane potential changes. =Resting membrane potential= The phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane is, in itself, highly impermeable to ions. The complete structure of the cell membrane includes many proteins that are embedded in or completely cross the lipid bilayer. Some of those proteins allow for the highly specific passage of ions, ion channels. Leak potassium channels allow potassium to flow through the membrane in response to the disparity in concentrations of potassium inside (high concentration) and outside the cell (low). The loss of positive(+) charges of the potassium(K+) ions from the inside of the cell results in a negative potential there compared to the extracellular surface of the membrane. A much smaller \\"leak\\" of sodium(Na+) into the cell results in the actual resting potential, about ‚Äì70 mV, being less negative than the calculated potential for K+ alone, the equilibrium potential, about ‚Äì90 mV. The sodium-potassium ATPase is an active transporter within the membrane that pumps potassium (2 ions) back into the cell and sodium (3 ions) out of the cell, maintaining the concentrations of both ions as well as preserving the voltage polarization. =Depolarization= However, once a stimulus activates the voltage-gated sodium channels to open, positive sodium ions flood into the cell and the voltage increases. This process can also be initiated by ligand or neurotransmitter binding to a ligand-gated channel. More sodium is outside the cell relative to the inside, and the positive charge within the cell propels the outflow of potassium ions through delayed-rectifier voltage-gated potassium channels. Since the potassium channels within the cell membrane are delayed, any further entrance of sodium activates more and more voltage-gated sodium channels. Depolarization above threshold results in an increase in the conductance of Na sufficient for inward sodium movement to swamp outward potassium movement immediately. If the influx of sodium ions fails to reach threshold, then sodium conductance does not increase a sufficient amount to override the resting potassium conductance. In that case, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations are observed in some type of neurons. If successful, the sudden influx of positive charge depolarizes the membrane, and potassium is delayed in re-establishing, or hyperpolarizing, the cell. Sodium influx depolarizes the cell in attempt to establish its own equilibrium potential (about +52 mV) to make the inside of the cell more positive relative to the outside. =Variations= The value of threshold can vary according to numerous factors. Changes in the ion conductances of sodium or potassium can lead to either a raised or lowered value of threshold. Additionally, the diameter of the axon, density of voltage activated sodium channels, and properties of sodium channels within the axon all affect the threshold value. Typically in the axon or dendrite, there are small depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals resulting from a prior stimulus. The passive spread of these signals depend on the passive electrical properties of the cell. The signals can only continue along the neuron to cause an action potential further down if they are strong enough to make it past the cell's membrane resistance and capacitance. For example, a neuron with a large diameter has more ionic channels in its membrane than a smaller cell, resulting in a lower resistance to the flow of ionic current. The current spreads quicker in a cell with less resistance, and is more likely to reach the threshold at other portions of the neuron. The threshold potential has also been shown experimentally to adapt to slow changes in input characteristics by regulating sodium channel density as well as inactivating these sodium channels overall. Hyperpolarization by the delayed-rectifier potassium channels causes a relative refractory period that makes it much more difficult to reach threshold. The delayed-rectifier potassium channels are responsible for the late outward phase of the action potential, where they open at a different voltage stimulus compared to the quickly activated sodium channels. They rectify, or repair, the balance of ions across the membrane by opening and letting potassium flow down its concentration gradient from inside to outside the cell. They close slowly as well, resulting in an outward flow of positive charge that exceeds the balance necessary. It results in excess negativity in the cell, requiring an extremely large stimulus and resulting depolarization to cause a response. Tracking techniques Threshold tracking techniques test nerve excitability, and depend on the properties of axonal membranes and sites of stimulation. They are extremely sensitive to the membrane potential and changes in this potential. These tests can measure and compare a control threshold (or resting threshold) to a threshold produced by a change in the environment, by a preceding single impulse, an impulse train, or a subthreshold current. Measuring changes in threshold can indicate changes in membrane potential, axonal properties, and/or the integrity of the myelin sheath. Threshold tracking allows for the strength of a test stimulus to be adjusted by a computer in order to activate a defined fraction of the maximal nerve or muscle potential. A threshold tracking experiment consists of a 1-ms stimulus being applied to a nerve in regular intervals. The action potential is recorded downstream from the triggering impulse. The stimulus is automatically decreased in steps of a set percentage until the response falls below the target (generation of an action potential). Thereafter, the stimulus is stepped up or down depending on whether the previous response was lesser or greater than the target response until a resting (or control) threshold has been established. Nerve excitability can then be changed by altering the nerve environment or applying additional currents. Since the value of a single threshold current provides little valuable information because it varies within and between subjects, pairs of threshold measurements, comparing the control threshold to thresholds produced by refractoriness, supernormality, strength-duration time constant or \\"threshold electrotonus\\" are more useful in scientific and clinical study. Tracking threshold has advantages over other electrophysiological techniques, like the constant stimulus method. This technique can track threshold changes within a dynamic range of 200% and in general give more insight into axonal properties than other tests. Also, this technique allows for changes in threshold to be given a quantitative value, which when mathematically converted into a percentage, can be used to compare single fiber and multifiber preparations, different neuronal sites, and nerve excitability in different species. =\\"Threshold electrotonus\\"= A specific threshold tracking technique is threshold electrotonus, which uses the threshold tracking set-up to produce long-lasting subthreshold depolarizing or hyperpolarizing currents within a membrane. Changes in cell excitability can be observed and recorded by creating these long-lasting currents. Threshold decrease is evident during extensive depolarization, and threshold increase is evident with extensive hyperpolarization. With hyperpolarization, there is an increase in the resistance of the internodal membrane due to closure of potassium channels, and the resulting plot \\"fans out\\". Depolarization produces has the opposite effect, activating potassium channels, producing a plot that \\"fans in\\". The most important factor determining threshold electrotonus is membrane potential, so threshold electrotonus can also be used as an index of membrane potential. Furthermore, it can be used to identify characteristics of significant medical conditions through comparing the effects of those conditions on threshold potential with the effects viewed experimentally. For example, ischemia and depolarization cause the same \\"fanning in\\" effect of the electrotonus waveforms. This observation leads to the conclusion that ischemia may result from over-activation of potassium channels. Clinical significance The role of the threshold potential has been implicated in a clinical context, namely in the functioning of the nervous system itself as well as in the cardiovascular system. =Febrile seizures= A febrile seizure, or \\"fever fit\\", is a convulsion associated with a significant rise in body temperature, occurring most commonly in early childhood. Repeated episodes of childhood febrile seizures are associated with an increased risk of temporal lobe epilepsy in adulthood. With patch clamp recording, an analogous state was replicated in vitro in rat cortical neurons after induction of febrile body temperatures; a notable decrease in threshold potential was observed. The mechanism for this decrease possibly involves suppression of inhibition mediated by the GABAB receptor with excessive heat exposure. =ALS and diabetes= Abnormalities in neuronal excitability have been noted in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and diabetes patients. While the mechanism ultimately responsible for the variance differs between the two conditions, tests through a response to ischemia indicate a similar resistance, ironically, to ischemia and resulting paresthesias. As ischemia occurs through inhibition of the sodium-potassium pump, abnormalities in the threshold potential are hence implicated. =Arrythmia= Since the 1940s, the concept of diastolic depolarization, or \\"pacemaker potential\\", has become established; this mechanism is a characteristic distinctive of cardiac tissue. When the threshold is reached and the resulting action potential fires, a heartbeat results from the interactions; however, when this heartbeat occurs at an irregular time, a potentially serious condition known as arrythmia may result. Use of medications A variety of drugs can present prolongation of the QT interval as a side effect. Prolongation of this interval is a result of a delay in sodium and calcium channel inactivation; without proper channel inactivation, the threshold potential is reached prematurely and thus arrhythmia tends to result. These drugs, known as pro-arrhythmic agents, include antimicrobials, antipsychotics, methadone, and, ironically, antiarrhythmic agents. The use of such agents is particularly frequent in intensive care units, and special care must be exercised when QT intervals are prolonged in such patients: arrhythmias as a result of prolonged QT intervals include the potentially fatal torsades de pointes, or TdP. Role of diet Diet may be a variable in the risk of arrhythmia. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, found in fish oils and several plant oils, serve a role in the prevention of arrhythmias. By inhibiting the voltage-dependent sodium current, these oils shift the threshold potential to a more positive value; therefore, an action potential requires increased depolarization. Clinically therapeutic use of these extracts remains a subject of research, but a strong correlation is established between regular consumption of fish oil and lower frequency of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation, a severe and increasingly common arrythmia.

Wings 3D is named after the winged-edge data structure it uses internally to store coordinate and adjacency data, and is commonly referred to by its users simply as Wings. Wings 3D is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, using the Erlang environment. Overview Wings 3D can be used to model and texture low to mid-range polygon models. Wings does not support animations and has only basic OpenGL rendering facilities, although it can export to external rendering software such as POV-Ray and YafRay. Wings is often used in combination with other software, whereby models made in Wings are exported to applications more specialized in rendering and animation such as Blender. Interface Wings 3D uses context-sensitive menus as opposed to a highly graphical, icon-oriented interface. Modeling is done using the mouse and keyboard to select and modify different aspects of a model's geometry in four different selection modes: Vertex, Edge, Face and Body. Because of Wings's context-sensitive design, each selection mode has its own set of mesh tools. Many of these tools offer both basic and advanced uses, allowing users to specify vectors and points to change how a tool will affect their model. Wings also allows users to add textures and materials to models, and has built-in AutoUV mapping facilities.

It electrically connects the atria and ventricles. The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, and conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm).Full Size Picture triangle of-Koch.jpg. Retrieved on 2008-12-22 Structure =Location= The AV node lies at the lower back section of the interatrial septum near the opening of the coronary sinus, which conducts the normal electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles. The AV node is quite compact (~1 x 3 x 5 mm). It is located at the center of Koch's triangle‚Äîa triangle enclosed by the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, the coronary sinus, and the membranous part of the interatrial septum.Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 17e‚Äù Section 3: Disorders of Rhythm =Blood supply= The blood supply of the AV node is from the atrioventricular nodal branch. The origin of this artery is most commonly (80-90% of hearts) a branch of the right coronary artery, with the remainder originating from the left circumflex artery. This is associated with the dominance of the coronary artery circulation. In right-dominant individuals the blood supply is from the right coronary artery while in left dominant individuals it originates from the left circumflex artery. =Development= BMP (Bone morphogenetic protein) cell signaling plays a key role in diverse aspects of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. (BMPs) are multifunctional signaling molecules critical for the development of AV node. BMP influences AV node development through Alk3 receptor (Activin receptor-like kinase 3). Abnormalities seen in BMP and Alk3 are associated with some cardiovascular diseases like Ebstein‚Äôs anomaly and AV conduction disease. Function heart conduction system showing atrioventricular node The AV node receives two inputs from the right atrium: posteriorly, via the crista terminalis, and anteriorly, via the interatrial septum. Contraction of heart muscle cells requires depolarization and repolarization of their cell membranes. Movement of ions across cell membranes causes these events. The cardiac conduction system (and AV node part of it) coordinates myocyte mechanical activity. A wave of excitation spreads out from the sinoatrial node through the atria along specialized conduction channels. This activates the AV node. The atrioventricular node delays impulses by approximately 0.09s. This delay in the cardiac pulse is extremely important: It ensures that the atria have ejected their blood into the ventricles first before the ventricles contract.Campbell, N., & Reece, J. (2002). Biology. 6th ed. San Francisco: Benjamin Cummings This also protects the ventricles from excessively fast rate response to atrial arrhythmias (see below). AV conduction during normal cardiac rhythm occurs through two different pathways: *the first ‚Äúpathway‚Äù has a slow conduction velocity but shorter refractory period *the second ‚Äúpathway‚Äù has a faster conduction velocity but longer refractory period. An important property that is unique to the AV node is decremental conduction, in which the more frequently the node is stimulated the slower it conducts. This is the property of the AV node that prevents rapid conduction to the ventricle in cases of rapid atrial rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The AV node's normal intrinsic firing rate without stimulation (such as that from the SA node) is 40-60 times/minute. This property is important because loss of the conduction system before the AV node should still result in pacing of the ventricles by the ‚Äî slower ‚Äî pacemaking ability of the AV node. Clinical significance * Atrioventricular conduction disease (AV block) describes impairment of the electrical continuity between the atria and ventricles. It occurs when the atrial depolarization fail to reach the ventricles or is conducted with an abnormally long delay. It can result from an injury or be a genetically inherited disorder. * Atrioventricular nodal re- entry tachycardia. * Cystic tumour of atrioventricular nodal region (CTAVN) CTAVN is of endodermal origin and occurs exclusively in the area of the AV node, tricuspid valve, and interatrial septum.

Berrigan's active protest against the Vietnam War earned him both scorn and admiration, especially regarding his association with the Catonsville Nine. It also landed him on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \\"most wanted list\\" (the first-ever priest on the list),https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21699058-first-ever-priest-fbis- most-wanted-list-died-april-30th-aged-94-obituary-daniel on the cover of Time magazine, and in prison. For the rest of his life, Berrigan remained one of the United States' leading anti-war activists. In 1980, he founded the Plowshares movement, an anti-nuclear protest group, that put him back into the national spotlight. He was also an award-winning and prolific author of some 50 books, a teacher, and a university educator. Early life Berrigan was born in Virginia, Minnesota, the son of Frieda Berrigan (n√©e Fromhart), who was of German descent, and Thomas Berrigan, a second-generation Irish Catholic and active trade union member. He was the fifth of six sons. His youngest brother was fellow peace activist Philip Berrigan. At age 5, Berrigan's family moved to Syracuse, New York. In 1946, Berrigan earned a bachelor's degree from St. Andrew-on-Hudson, a Jesuit seminary in Hyde Park, New York. In 1952 he received a master's degree from Woodstock College in Baltimore, Maryland. Berrigan was devoted to the Catholic Church throughout his youth. He joined the Jesuits directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood on June 19, 1952. Career Berrigan taught at St. Peter's Preparatory School in Jersey City from 1946 to 1949. In 1954, Berrigan was assigned to teach French and theology at the Jesuit Brooklyn Preparatory School. In 1957 he was appointed professor of New Testament studies at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York. The same year, he won the Lamont Prize for his book of poems, Time Without Number. He developed a reputation as a religious radical, working actively against poverty and on changing the relationship between priests and lay people. While at Le Moyne, he founded its International House. While on a sabbatical from Le Moyne in 1963, Berrigan traveled to Paris and met French Jesuits who criticized the social and political conditions in Indochina. Taking inspiration from this, he and his brother Philip founded the Catholic Peace Fellowship, a group that organized protests against the war in Vietnam. On October 28, 1965, Berrigan, along with the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, founded an organization known as Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam (CALCAV). The organization, founded at the Church Center for the United Nations, was joined by the likes of Dr. Hans Morgenthau, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Rev. William Sloane Coffin, and the Rev. Philip Berrigan, among many others. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who delivered his 1967 speech Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence under sponsorship from CALCAV, served as the national co-chairman of the organization. From 1966 to 1970, Berrigan was the assistant director of the Cornell University United Religious Work (CURW), the umbrella organization for all religious groups on campus, including the Cornell Newman Club (later the Cornell Catholic Community), eventually becoming the group's pastor. Berrigan was the first faculty advisor of Cornell University's first gay rights student group, the Student Homophile League, in 1968. Berrigan at one time or another held faculty positions or ran programs at Union Theological Seminary, Loyola University New Orleans, Columbia, Cornell, and Yale. His longest tenure was at Fordham (a Jesuit university located in the Bronx), where for a brief time he also served as poet-in-residence. Berrigan appeared briefly in the 1986 Warner Bros. film The Mission, playing a Jesuit priest. He also served as a consultant on the film.  Activism  = Vietnam War era = Berrigan, his brother and Josephite priest Philip Berrigan, and Trappist monk Thomas Merton founded an interfaith coalition against the Vietnam War and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. In 1967, Berrigan witnessed the public outcry that followed from the arrest of his brother Philip, for pouring blood on draft records as part of the Baltimore Four.Religion and War Resistance in the Plowshares Movement (2008) Sharon Erickson Nepstad, Cambridge University Press, p48 Philip was sentenced to six years in prison for defacing government property. The fallout he had to endure from these many interventions, including his support for prisoners of war and, in 1968, seeing firsthand the conditions on the ground in Vietnam,http://libguides.depaul.edu/ld.php?content_id=10135847 further radicalized Berrigan, or at least strengthened his determination to resist American military imperialism. Berrigan traveled to Hanoi with Howard Zinn during the Tet Offensive in January 1968 to \\"receive\\" three American airmen, the first American prisoners of war released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun.; new ed. 2002 In 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse to make tax payments in protest of the Vietnam War. In the same year, he was interviewed in the anti-Vietnam War documentary film In the Year of the Pig, and later that year became involved in radical non-violent protest. Catonsville Nine Daniel Berrigan and his brother Philip, along with seven other Catholic protesters, used homemade napalm to destroy 378 draft files in the parking lot of the Catonsville, Maryland, draft board on May 17, 1968. This group, which came to be known as the Catonsville Nine, issued a statement after the incident: Berrigan was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, but went into hiding with the help of fellow radicals prior to imprisonment. While on the run, Berrigan was interviewed for Lee Lockwood's documentary The Holy Outlaw. The Federal Bureau of Investigation apprehended him on August 11, 1970 at the home of William Stringfellow and Anthony Towne. Berrigan was then imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut until his release on February 24, 1972. In retrospect, the trial of the Catonsville Nine was significant, because it \\"altered resistance to the Vietnam War, moving activists from street protests to repeated acts of civil disobedience, including the burning of draft cards.\\" As The New York Times noted in its obituary, Berrigan's actions helped \\"shape the tactics of opposition to the Vietnam War.\\" =Plowshares movement= Daniel Berrigan is arrested for civil disobedience outside the U.S. Mission to the U.N. in 2006 On September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Philip, and six others (the \\"Plowshares Eight\\") began the Plowshares movement. They trespassed onto the General Electric nuclear missile facility in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where they damaged nuclear warhead nose cones and poured blood onto documents and files. They were arrested and charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. On April 10, 1990, after ten years of appeals, Berrigan's group was re-sentenced and paroled for up to months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was re- created in Emile de Antonio's 1982 film In the King of Prussia, which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves. = Consistent life ethic = Berrigan endorsed a consistent life ethic, a morality based on a holistic reverence for life. As a member of the Rochester, New York-area consistent life ethic advocacy group Faith and Resistance Community, he protested via civil disobedience against abortion at a new Planned Parenthood clinic in 1991. =AIDS activism= Berrigan said of pastoral care to AIDS patients: Berrigan published Sorrow Built a Bridge: Friendship and AIDS reflecting on his experiences ministering to AIDS patients through the Supportive Care Program at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in 1989. The Religious Studies Review wrote, \\"the strength of this volume lies in its capacity to portray sensitively the impact of AIDS on human lives.\\" Speaking about AIDS patients, many of whom were gay, The Charlotte Observer quoted Berrigan saying in 1991, \\"Both the church and the state are finding ways to kill people with AIDS, and one of the ways is ostracism that pushes people between the cracks of respectability or acceptability and leaves them there to make of life what they will or what they cannot.\\" =Other activism= Berrigan and his niece, Frida Berrigan, at the Witness Against Torture event held in NYC's Lower East Side on December 18, 2008 Although much of his later work was devoted to assisting AIDS patients in New York City, Berrigan still held to his activist roots throughout his life. He maintained his opposition to American interventions abroad, from Central America in the 1980s, through the Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was also an opponent of capital punishment, a contributing editor of Sojourners, and a supporter of the Occupy movement. Berrigan has been considered by many to be a Christian anarchist.

Cengage Learning; 1 January 2016. . p. 129‚Äì.) is a collection of heart muscle cells specialized for electrical conduction. As part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, it transmits the electrical impulses from the AV node (located between the atria and the ventricles) to the point of the apex of the fascicular branches via the bundle branches. The fascicular branches then lead to the Purkinje fibers, which provide electrical conduction to the ventricles, causing the cardiac muscle of the ventricles to contract at a paced interval. Function The bundle of His is an important part of the electrical conduction system of the heart, as it transmits impulses from the atrioventricular node, located at the anterior-inferior end of the interatrial septum, to the ventricles of the heart. The bundle of His branches into the left and the right bundle branches, which run along the interventricular septum. The left bundle branch further divides into the left anterior and the left posterior fascicles. These bundles and fascicles give rise to thin filaments known as Purkinje fibers. These fibers distribute the impulse to the ventricular muscle. The ventricular conduction system comprises the bundle branches and the Purkinje networks. It takes about 0.03‚Äì0.04 seconds for the impulse to travel from the bundle of His to the ventricular muscle. Clinical significance Disorders affecting the cardiomyocytes that make up the electrical conduction system of the heart are called heart blocks. Heart blocks are separated into different categories based on the location of the cellular damage. Damage to any of the conducting cells in or below the bundle of His is collectively referred to as \\"infra- Hisian blocks\\". To be specific, blocks that occur in the right or left bundle branches are called \\"bundle branch blocks\\", and those that occur in either the left anterior or the left posterior fascicles are called \\"fascicular blocks\\", or \\"hemiblocks\\". The conditions in which both the right bundle branch and either the left anterior fascicle or the left posterior fascicle are blocked are collectively referred to as bifascicular blocks, and the condition in which the right bundle branch, the left anterior fascicle, and the left posterior fascicle are blocked is called trifascicular block. Infra-hisian blocks limit the heart's ability to coordinate the activities of the atria and ventricles, which usually results in a decrease in its efficiency in pumping blood. =Pacing= A 2000 study found that direct His bundle pacing is more effective in producing synchronized ventricular contraction‚Äîand therefore in improving cardiac function‚Äîthan apical pacing. Etymology These specialized muscle fibers in the heart were named after the Swiss cardiologist Wilhelm His Jr., who discovered them in 1893.

Commentary Rat bite fever is caused by either Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minor. The incidence of rat-bite fever is highest in urban areas with poor sanitation where the rat population is high, however in recent times cases have also been attributed to occupational contact with rodents such as pet shop employees or laboratory workers or through pet ownership. While the disease is usually caused by a bite, it can also occur from close contact with rodents or ingestion of contaminated food or water. The latter is known as Haverhill fever. The disease typically presents with chills and fever accompanied by headache, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash and arthritis develop 2‚Äì4 days after the initial onset. Less commonly the infection can cause pneumonitis, endocarditis or meningitis. As these symptoms are common to many febrile diseases, this is often classified as a fever of unknown origin (FUO).

Biography  Born in Hartlepool in the fortieth year of Queen Victoria's reign, she lived under the rule of five more monarchs and 24 UK Prime Ministers. Hughes grew up in Middlesbrough in Yorkshire, where her father ran a music shop. She worked as a teacher in a primary school from the age of thirteen and married Noel Hughes, a retired army captain, after she retired aged 63. They remained married until Noel's death in 1979 at the age of 88. Her father, Herbert Milburn, died at age 93 and her mother, Annie, at 92. She had three younger brothers, Herbert, Henry and Reginald. Herbert died at 58 and Reginald at 62. She remained in robust health into extreme old age and achieved public recognition for her longevity, including tea with then-UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in 1985, whom she jokingly admonished against cuddling up to her, as Hughes was a Labour Party supporter. Thatcher replied by saying \\"Oh well, never mind, let's have a cup of tea.\\" However, Hughes admitted to personally liking Thatcher, and described the Prime Minister as \\"A very nice woman.\\" For her one-hundred and tenth birthday, she flew on Concorde to New York City, one of only two supercentenarian air passengers ever recorded. She stayed at The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for four days on an all-expenses paid visit and met then-Mayor Ed Koch. She became the oldest person in the United Kingdom when Scotland's Kate Begbie died in 1988, and broke the national longevity record, held until then by Anna Eliza Williams, in early-1992. Hughes lived in her own home in Marske-by-the-Sea until 1991, when she moved to a nursing home in Redcar due to her becoming too frail to look after herself. She also spent her final years in a wheelchair, though she remained mentally alert and sharp to the end of her life. She was described by relatives as \\"extremely domineering, outspoken, and sharp; but also as friendly and witty.\\" Hughes was never interviewed by demographers or other aging researchers, though the historian Peter Laslett went through the documentation pertaining to her case.

In 1972, he began studying political science and public administration at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Gillon is married to Sari. He has three children and five grandchildren. Shin Bet career In 1972, Gillon was recruited by Shin Bet during his university studies. He initially worked as a bodyguard for senior staff. From 1982 to 1987, he was chief of the Shin Bet Jewish Department. From 1987 to 1989, he attended the National Security College, serving in a number of senior positions during his studies for an MA in political science and public administration. From 1989, he was chief of the Training Division. From 1990, he was chief of the Shin Bet Northern Command, a position in which he was responsible for Shin Bet activity in Lebanon. From 1993 to 1994, he was chief of the Administrative Division, responsible for HR, finances, and logistics. For four months in 1994, he was Shin Bet acting director during Yaakov Peri‚Äôs academic leave. From March 1995 to February 1996, Gillon was the director of Shin Bet. B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, and other human rights organizations have criticized his oversight. \\"During his tenure, and until the Israel High Court of Justice ruled against such methods in 1999, GSS interrogators were officially sanctioned to use 'moderate physical pressure' on detainees (the vast majority of them Palestinians),\\" according to Amnesty International. From October 1994, when a suicide bomb killed 23 people, they were allowed to use \\"increased physical pressure\\". Secret government guidelines set down what \\"moderate physical pressure\\" and \\"increased physical pressure\\" allowed; according to court testimonies of GSS members themselves, this included subjecting detainees to sleep deprivation, prolonged shackling in painful positions, hooding with filthy sacks, being forced to squat like a frog (gambaz) and violent shaking (tiltul). During Carmi Gillon's period of service with the GSS such methods of interrogation were used against several hundred Palestinian detainees every year, many of whom were later released without charge.Amnesty International calls on Denmark to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention against Torture 14 August 2001, AI Index MDE 15/074/2001 - News Service Nr. 143 In 1995, the Shin Bet's VIP protection unit failed to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin. Gillon had been in Paris at the time of the assassination, and upon returning to Israel, immediately submitted his resignation to Acting Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who rejected it. Nevertheless, he resigned the following year. The Shamgar Commission was critical of the Shin Bet under his tenure. Private sector After leaving the service, Gillon served as general manager of the Avner Insurance Company (1997‚Äì2000) and then as director general of the Peres Center for Peace (2000‚Äì2001). He also studied at Harvard Business School. Ambassador to Denmark From 2001 to 2003, he was the Israeli ambassador to Denmark. When he was nominated for the position in 2001, Human Rights Watch called for the Danish government to reject his appointmentLetter to Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mogens Lykketoft, Human Rights Watch 18 July 2001 and for Israel to withdraw his nomination, while Amnesty International asked the Danish authorities to investigate him for torture, and if there was enough evidence for a prosecution, to detain him under the UN Convention against Torture, and to either try him or extradite him to a state willing to try him. Danish Justice Minister Frank Jensen initially said that Gillon could be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Convention after he admitted using \\"moderate physical pressure\\" on Palestinian detainees,Sharon 'preparing war crimes defence', BBC News 26 July 2001 but later backed down, acknowledging that as an ambassador, Gillon was protected by diplomatic immunity. Gillon defended the use of torture as a means of \\"self-defense against terrorism.\\" He told Danish media that Israel might have to re- introduce \\"moderate physical pressure\\" when interrogating suspected Palestinian terrorists. \\"We banned this form of interrogation in Israel in 1999 because of the peace process. Unfortunately, it looks like we may have to start using it again,\\" Gillon said. One member of parliament, Centre Democrat leader Peter Duetoft, called opposition to Gillon's appointment \\"hypocritical\\" because Yasser Arafat, \\"the biggest terrorist\\", had recently visited Denmark without there having been similar objections.Something rotten in Denmark , by Ellis Shuman, Israel Insider 26 July 2001 In January 2014, Gillon arrived in Denmark to attend the Copenhagen Film Festival for a screening of The Gatekeepers and to deliver a lecture. After a Danish anti-torture NGO reported Gillon to the police for torture, Gillon left Denmark on January 10. The Prosecutor's Office subsequently rejected the complaint due to lack of evidence.https://www.timesofisrael.com/former-shin-bet-head-leaves-denmark- over-torture-complaint/Tortur Anklaget Eksdiplomat forlader Danmark, Politiken, 11 January 2014 Politics and other activities From 2003 to 2007, he was elected head of the Mevasseret Zion local council. From 2007 to 2013, he was vice president for external relations for Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Gillon has been a member of a number of boards of directors, including the Tahal Group, Danker Investment, and the Arab Israel Bank. From 2014, he was chairman and CEO of Carmi Gillon Inc., chairman of CYTEGIC, and external director of the Dan Hotels chain.Carmi Gillon -- CV, http://www.carmigillon.com/#!resume/galleryPage, accessed 5 May 2015 Over the years, Gillon has written several books and a range of articles on the subjects of foreign affairs and security.

Blue = troponin C; green = troponin I; magenta = troponin T.; ; rendered with PyMOL Troponin, or the troponin complex, is a complex of three regulatory proteins (troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T) that are integral to muscle contraction in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but not smooth muscle. Measurements of cardiac-specific troponins I and T are extensively used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in the management of myocardial infarction and acute coronary syndrome. Blood troponin levels may be used as a diagnostic marker for stroke, although the sensitivity of this measurement is low. Function Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, which causes it to change shape, exposing binding sites for myosin (active sites) on the actin filaments. Myosin's binding to actin causes crossbridge formation, and contraction of the muscle begins. Troponin activation. Troponin C (red) binds Ca2+, which stabilizes the activated state, where troponin I (yellow) is no longer bound to actin. Troponin T (blue) anchors the complex on tropomyosin. Troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle. The main difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion-binding sites, whereas in cardiac muscle there are only three. The actual amount of calcium that binds to troponin has not been definitively established. Physiology In both cardiac and skeletal muscles, muscular force production is controlled primarily by changes in the intracellular calcium concentration. In general, when calcium rises, the muscles contract and, when calcium falls, the muscles relax. Troponin is a component of thin filaments (along with actin and tropomyosin), and is the protein complex to which calcium binds to trigger the production of muscular force. Troponin itself has three subunits, TnC, TnI, and TnT, each playing a role in force regulation . Under resting intracellular levels of calcium, tropomyosin covers the active sites on actin to which myosin (a molecular motor organized in muscle thick filaments) binds in order to generate force. When calcium becomes bound to specific sites in the N-domain of TnC, a series of protein structural changes occurs such that tropomyosin is rolled away from myosin-binding sites on actin, allowing myosin to attach to the thin filament and produce force and shorten the sarcomere. Individual subunits serve different functions: * Troponin C binds to calcium ions to produce a conformational change in TnI * Troponin T binds to tropomyosin, interlocking them to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex * Troponin I binds to actin in thin myofilaments to hold the actin-tropomyosin complex in place Smooth muscle does not have troponin. =Subunits= TnT is a tropomyosin-binding subunit which regulates the interaction of troponin complex with thin filaments; TnI inhibits ATP-ase activity of acto-myosin; TnC is a Ca2+-binding subunit, playing the main role in Ca2+ dependent regulation of muscle contraction. TnT and TnI in cardiac muscle are presented by forms different from those in skeletal muscles. Two isoforms of TnI and two isoforms of TnT are expressed in human skeletal muscle tissue (skTnI and skTnT). Only one tissue-specific isoform of TnI is described for cardiac muscle tissue (cTnI), whereas the existence of several cardiac specific isoforms of TnT (cTnT) are described in the literature. No cardiac specific isoforms are known for human TnC. TnC in human cardiac muscle tissue is presented by an isoform typical for slow skeletal muscle. Another form of TnC, fast skeletal TnC isoform, is more typical for fast skeletal muscles. cTnI is expressed only in myocardium. No examples of cTnI expression in healthy or injured skeletal muscle or in other tissue types are known. cTnT is probably less cardiac specific. Expression of cTnT in skeletal tissue of patients with chronic skeletal muscle injuries has been described. Inside the cardiac troponin complex the strongest interaction between molecules has been demonstrated for cTnI ‚Äì TnC binary complex especially in the presence of Ca2+ ( KA = 1.5x10‚àí8 M‚àí1). TnC, forming a complex with cTnI, changes the conformation of cTnI molecule and shields part of its surface. According to the latest data cTnI is released in the blood stream of the patient in the form of binary complex with TnC or ternary complex with cTnT and TnC. cTnI-TnC complex formation plays an important positive role in improving the stability of cTnI molecule. cTnI, which is extremely unstable in its free form, demonstrates significantly better stability in complex with TnC or in ternary cTnI-cTnT-TnC complex. It has been demonstrated that stability of cTnI in native complex is significantly better than stability of the purified form of the protein or the stability of cTnI in artificial troponin complexes combined from purified proteins. Research =Cardiac conditions= Certain subtypes of troponin (cardiac I and T) are sensitive and specific indicators of damage to the heart muscle (myocardium). They are measured in the blood to differentiate between unstable angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack) in people with chest pain or acute coronary syndrome. A person who recently had a myocardial infarction would have an area of damaged heart muscle and elevated cardiac troponin levels in the blood. This can also occur in people with coronary vasospasm, a type of myocardial infarction involving severe constriction of the cardiac blood vessels. After a myocardial infarction troponins may remain high for up to 2 weeks. Cardiac troponins are a marker of all heart muscle damage, not just myocardial infarction, which is the most severe form of heart disorder. However, diagnostic criteria for raised troponin indicating myocardial infarction is currently set by the WHO at a threshold of 2 Œºg or higher. Critical levels of other cardiac biomarkers are also relevant, such as creatine kinase. Other conditions that directly or indirectly lead to heart muscle damage and death can also increase troponin levels, such as kidney failure. Severe tachycardia (for example due to supraventricular tachycardia) in an individual with normal coronary arteries can also lead to increased troponins for example, it is presumed due to increased oxygen demand and inadequate supply to the heart muscle. Troponins are also increased in patients with heart failure, where they also predict mortality and ventricular rhythm abnormalities. They can rise in inflammatory conditions such as myocarditis and pericarditis with heart muscle involvement (which is then termed myopericarditis). Troponins can also indicate several forms of cardiomyopathy, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or (left) ventricular hypertrophy, peripartum cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative disorders such as cardiac amyloidosis. Heart injury with increased troponins also occurs in cardiac contusion, defibrillation and internal or external cardioversion. Troponins are commonly increased in several procedures such as cardiac surgery and heart transplantation, closure of atrial septal defects, percutaneous coronary intervention, or radiofrequency ablation. =Non-cardiac conditions= The distinction between cardiac and non-cardiac conditions is somewhat artificial; the conditions listed below are not primary heart diseases, but they exert indirect effects on the heart muscle. Troponins are increased in around 40% of patients with critical illnesses such as sepsis. There is an increased risk of mortality and length of stay in the intensive-care unit in these patients. In severe gastrointestinal bleeding, there can also be a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply of the myocardium. Chemotherapy agents can exert toxic effects on the heart (examples include anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin). Several toxins and venoms can also lead to heart muscle injury (scorpion venom, snake venom, and venom from jellyfish and centipedes). Carbon monoxide poisoning or cyanide poisoning can also be accompanied by release of troponins due to hypoxic cardiotoxic effects. Cardiac injury occurs in about one-third of severe CO poisoning cases, and troponin screening is appropriate in these patients. In both primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), right ventricular strain results in increased wall tension and may cause ischemia. Of course, patients with COPD exacerbations might also have concurrent myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, so care has to be taken to attribute increased troponin levels to COPD. People with end-stage kidney disease can have chronically elevated troponin T levels, which are linked to a poorer prognosis. Troponin I is less likely to be falsely elevated. Strenuous endurance exercise such as marathons or triathlons can lead to increased troponin levels in up to one-third of subjects, but it is not linked to adverse health effects in these competitors. High troponin T levels have also been reported in patients with inflammatory muscle diseases such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Troponins are also increased in rhabdomyolysis. In hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia, elevated troponin levels indicate some degree of myofibrillary damage. Cardiac troponin T and I can be used to monitor drug and toxin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity. . In 2020, it was found that COVID-19 patients with severe disease had higher troponin I levels compared to those with milder disease. =Prognostic use= Elevated troponin levels are prognostically important in many of the conditions in which they are used for diagnosis. In a community-based cohort study indicating the importance of silent cardiac damage, troponin I has been shown to predict mortality and first coronary heart disease event in men free from cardiovascular disease at baseline. In people with stroke, elevated blood troponin levels are not a useful marker to detect the condition. =Subunits= First cTnI and later cTnT were originally used as markers for cardiac cell death. Both proteins are now widely used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina, post-surgery myocardium trauma and some other diseases related with cardiac muscle injury. Both markers can be detected in patient's blood 3‚Äì6 hours after onset of the chest pain, reaching peak level within 16‚Äì30 hours. Elevated concentration of cTnI and cTnT in blood samples can be detected even 5‚Äì8 days after onset of the symptoms, making both proteins useful also for the late diagnosis of AMI. Detection Cardiac troponin T and I are measured by immunoassay methods. * Due to patent regulations, a single manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) distributes cTnT. * A host of diagnostic companies make cTnI immunoassay methods available on many different immunoassay platforms.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00531/abstract Troponin elevation following cardiac cell necrosis starts within 2‚Äì3 hours, peaks in approx. 24 hours, and persists for 1‚Äì2 weeks.

Broadly stated, RMA claims that in certain periods of the history of humankind, there were new military doctrines, strategies, tactics and technologies which led to an irrecoverable change in the conduct of warfare. Furthermore, those changes compel an accelerated adaptation of novel doctrines and strategies. In the United States, RMA is often linked to discussions such as the reorganization plan of the United States Army and total systems integration. History The original theorizing was done by the Soviet Armed Forces in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov.Steven Metz, James Kievit. \\"Strategy and the Revolution in Military Affairs: From Theory to Policy\\" June 27, 1995 The United States initially became interested in it through Andrew Marshall, the head of the Office of Net Assessment, a Department of Defense think tank. It slowly gained credence within official military circles, and other nations began exploring similar shifts in organization and technology. Interest in RMA and the structure of future U.S. armed forces is strong within China's People's Liberation Army and it has been incorporated into China's strategic military doctrine. Many other militaries have also researched and considered RMA as an organizational concept‚Äîe.g., those of Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Singapore, Republic of China (Taiwan), India, Russia, and Germany‚Äîbut not all militaries have adopted RMA, due to its significant infrastructure and investment costs. = Soviet views = Nikolai Ogarkov called the early idea of RMA the Military Technological Revolution (MTR). Pentagon officials in the United States changed the name of his original idea, which is how it became known as RMA. Orgarkov's belief that the potential and possibility for new weapons was increasing rapidly led to the development of his initial idea. At the time of the initial development of MTR, the Soviets anticipated that certain technologies, including energy weapons and robots, would be in use by 2015 at the latest. They believed that the use of large ground forces would be minimized. In place of some ground forces, these new technologies would be implemented in order to establish dominance on the battlefield. Russians also believed that control of space would become essential for maintaining dominance in future conflicts. Soviets believed that it would be essential to control the satellite space around earth, in order to more effectively relay information. They also anticipated the ability to use space as a medium in which they could deploy weapons. = Renewed interest = The United States' victory in the 1991 Gulf War renewed interest in RMA theory. In the view of RMA proponents, American dominance through superior technology emphasized how the United States' technological advances reduced the relative power of the Iraqi military, by no means a lightweight rival, to insignificance. According to Stephen Biddle, part of the growth in popularity of the RMA theory after the Gulf War was that virtually all American military experts drastically over-estimated the coalition casualty count. This led many experts to assume that their models of war were wrong‚Äîthat a revolution of sorts had occurred. After the Kosovo War, in which the United States did not lose a single life, others suggested that war had become too sterile, creating a \\"virtual war\\". Furthermore, the United States‚Äô inability to capture Osama bin Laden or effectively combat the Iraqi insurgency led some to question RMA in the face of asymmetrical warfare, in which foes of the United States may increasingly engage in order to counter RMA's advantages. In 1997, the U.S. Army mounted an exercise codenamed \\"Force 21\\", to test the application of digital technologies in warfare in order to improve communications and logistics by applying private-sector technologies adapted for military use. Specifically, it sought to increase awareness of one's position on the battlefield as well as that of the enemy, in order to achieve increased lethality, greater control of the tempo of warfare, and fewer instances of friendly fire via improved identification friend or foe.The United States Army 1995 Modernization Plan. Force 21 In 2002, Chris Bray described RMA as new ideas about \\"the use of information and automation on the battlefield\\" to make forces \\"more lethal\\" and \\"more agile.\\" Areas of focus One of the central problems in understanding the current debate over RMA arises from many theorists' use of the term to refer to the revolutionary technology itself, which is the driving force of change. Concurrently, other theorists tend to use the term as referring to revolutionary adaptations by military organisations that may be necessary to deal with the changes in technology. Other theorists place RMA more closely inside the specific political and economic context of globalization and the end of the Cold War. When reviewing the gamut of theories, three fundamental versions of RMA come to the forefront. The first perspective focuses primarily upon changes in the nation-state and the role of an organised military in using force. This approach highlights the political, social, and economic factors worldwide, which might require a completely different type of military and organisational structure to apply force in the future. Authors such as the RAND Corporation's Sean J. A. Edwards (advocate of BattleSwarm tactics, a type of military swarming), Carl H. Builder and Lt. Col. Ralph Peters emphasized the decline of the nation-state, the nature of the emerging international order, and the different types of forces needed in the near future. The second perspective‚Äîmost commonly assigned the term RMA‚Äîhighlights the evolution of weapons technology, information technology, military organization, and military doctrine among advanced powers. This \\"System of Systems\\" perspective on RMA has been ardently supported by Admiral William Owens, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who identified three overlapping areas for force assets. These are intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, command, control, communications and intelligence processing, which allows for the use of precision force. Advanced versions of RMA incorporate other sophisticated technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), nanotechnology, robotics, and biotechnology. Recently, the RMA debate focussed on \\"network-centric warfare\\" which is a doctrine that aims to connect all troops on the battlefield. Finally, the third concept is that a \\"true\\" revolution in military affairs has not yet occurred or is unlikely to. Authors such as Michael E. O'Hanlon and Frederick Kagan, point to the fact much of the technology and weapons systems ascribed to the contemporary RMA were in development long before 1991 and the Internet and information technology boom. Several critics point out that a \\"revolution\\" within the military ranks might carry detrimental consequences, produce severe economic strain, and ultimately prove counterproductive. Such authors tend to profess a much more gradual \\"evolution\\" in military affairs, as opposed to a rapid revolution. = Precision attack = In considering the implications of precision attack, it is clear that precision weapons, when coupled to recent developments in aerospace, have transformed warfare, and as a result, the question is not that \\"Does an RMA exist?\\" rather, \\"When did it begin, and what are its implications?\\" Tied to this are surprisingly persistent questions about the use and value of air power, now more accurately seen as aerospace power. If nothing else, given the record of precision air power application, aerospace power advocates should not still have to spend as much time as they do arguing the merits of three-dimensional war and precision attack's value to it. Modern joint service aerospace forces offer the most responsive, flexible, lethal, and devastating form of power projection across the spectrum of conflict, employing a range of aerospace weaponry such as maritime patrol aircraft, attack and troop-lift helicopters, land-based long-range aircraft, and battlefield rocket artillery systems. Service-specific aerospace power can often be formidable and, as such, has transformed conflict from two- dimensional to three-dimensional, and has changed the critical focus of conflict from that of seizing and holding to one of halting and controlling. In reviewing a few points from the military history of the 20th century, within roughly a decade of the first flight of an airplane, aircraft were having an occasionally decisive effect on the battlefield. Within four decades, a nation‚ÄîGreat Britain‚Äîsecured its national survival through air warfare. By the midst of the Second World War, three-dimensional attack (from above and below the surface) had become the primary means of sinking both vessels at sea and destroying the combat capability of armies on land. In fact, for the United States, this trend of inflicting losses and material destruction primarily through air attack continued after the second world war for Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Bosnia, and other, lesser, conflicts. In particular, air attack directed against land forces has been especially powerful in blunting and destroying opponents on the offensive, whether in older experience‚Äîsuch as confronting Rommel in the Western Desert, or Nazi armored forces trying to split the Normandy invasion at Mortain, or at the Bulge (where German commanders credited Allied fighter attacks on fuel trucks and supplies as being the decisive factor in halting their drive), in the opening and closing stages of the Korean War, and confronting the 1972 North Vietnamese Spring Invasion‚Äîor, more recently, in destroying the Khafji offensive of Saddam Hussein in 1991. NATO's reliance upon air power in the Yugoslav Wars was not surprising because from the very earliest days, the NATO alliance saw air power as the linchpin of Western military strength and the necessary offset to the Warsaw Pact's huge military forces. Given its historical underpinnings, we should not be surprised that the revolution in warfare that has been brought about both by the confluence of the aerospace and the electronic revolutions, and by the offshoot of both‚Äîthe precision guided munition‚Äîis one that has been a long time coming, back to the Second World War, back, even, to the experimenters of the First World War who attempted, however crudely, to develop \\"smart\\" weapons to launch from airships and other craft. Used almost experimentally until the latter stages of the Vietnam War, the precision weapon since that time has increasingly come to first influence, then dominate, and now perhaps to render superfluous, the traditional notion of a linear battlefield. Criticism The revolution of military affairs is the inclusion and expansion of new technology‚Äîe.g., drones, satellite imaging, and remotely operated vehicles‚Äîwithin current military tactics. RMA has generally been praised for its ability to reduce casualty rates and facilitate intelligence gathering. On the other hand, some critics argue that RMA serves to further dissociate soldiers from the horrific realities of warfare, while others maintain that RMA restricts the overall understanding of warfare and its dynamics. Scholars recommend gaining a critical understanding of RMA before implementing it. Operation Desert Storm is considered the first major global conflict successfully implementing RMA and is considered a paragon of future military operations due to the low casualty rate and the U.S. military's speed and precision. On the other hand, others claim that RMA technology severely inhibited the U.S. military's ability to respond to guerrilla tactics and that efforts to incorporate advanced weapons like Patriot missiles were unsuccessful. Indeed, a number of epistemological issues have cropped up. In the wake of RMA technologies such as drones, unmanned ground vehicles, and clean bombs there are several concerns about the distancing and disassociation that eclipse the realities of war. An analysis of tactical strikes reveals that while the number of ones own soldiers may be preserved as the number of long-range attacks increases, so does collateral damage. Furthermore, by removing the soldier-on-soldier element of warfare, the natural reactions and consequences of wartime actions are impacted, which has been frequently referred to as the removal of humanity from war. RMA technological advances have resulted in a dehumanizing of warfare, which negatively effects the decisions made by officers, as well as individuals in the field. Another critique argues that RMA's good intentions notwithstanding, the resulting collateral damage is unacceptable and thus urges more careful consideration in incorporating RMA technology. Stephen Biddle's 2004 book, Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern War, discounts the idea of RMA. He argues that military doctrine and tactics are far more important to battle outcomes in modern warfare than is technological progress, and that basic doctrine has changed little since the second half of World War I.

Because greater EDVs cause greater distention of the ventricle, EDV is often used synonymously with preload, which refers to the length of the sarcomeres in cardiac muscle prior to contraction (systole). An increase in EDV increases the preload on the heart and, through the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart, increases the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle during systole (stroke volume). Sample values The right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) ranges between 100 and 160 mL. The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) is calculated by RVEDV/BSA and ranges between 60 and 100 mL/m2.

It is one of the few newspapers authorized by the Hong Kong SAR government to publicize legal announcements, and also the only Hong Kong newspaper allowed to be circulated freely in mainland China. It is controlled by the Hong Kong Liaison Office and has a branch office in Shenzhen.  History  The HKCD was founded on 11 October 1952, at a price of 10 HK cents. Its stated aim was to serve as the voice of the local Hong Kong commerce, with a focus on worldwide economies, especially in Hong Kong and China. It also covered sport and, on weekends, offering columns and serialized short stories with pictures. Early coverage of horse and dog racing was curtailed by the government the early 70s, so as not to promote gambling, leading to a severe decline in circulation. In December 1989, a majority shareholding was acquired by the Joint Publishing (HK) Company Limited (the joint company of The Commercial Press (H.K.) Ltd, Chung Hwa Book Co. and Joint Publishing) for HK$160 million. In 1995, HKCD launched a mainland edition, in cooperation with mainland publishing companies. Since 1996, an online version has been available. In May 2005, the paper was upgraded, priced at HK$3 in Hong Kong and overseas, while in Mainland China, it sold for 3 yuan within Guangdong Province and 5 yuan in other provinces. The new version of the paper emphasizes business news from Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, along with some sports coverage. In 2015, assistant editor-in-chief Long Zhenyang was placed under ‚Äúpolitical measures‚Äù for comments he made during the 2014 Hong Kong protests and regarding the demolition of churches in Zhejiang. For the following year, he did not work as an editor but was allowed to continue writing, and in February 2016 resigned and sought political asylum in the United States, comparing the sociopolitical climate in Chinese politics to the Cultural Revolution, and saying that \\"All hope for social reform, and reforms to China‚Äôs political system, have now been extinguished.\\"Long Zhenyang: The resignation that shook Hong Kong media, BBC News, Juliana Liu, 18 Feb 2017 Contents A typical edition contains about 30 pages.

ESV is the lowest volume of blood in the ventricle at any point in the cardiac cycle. The main factors that affect the end-systolic volume are afterload and the contractility of the heart. Uses End systolic volume can be used clinically as a measurement of the adequacy of cardiac emptying, related to systolic function. On an electrocardiogram, or ECG, the end-systolic volume will be seen at the end of the T wave. Clinically, ESV can be measured using two-dimensional echocardiography, MRI (magnetic resonance tomography) or cardiac CT (computed tomography) or SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). Sample values Along with end-diastolic volume, ESV determines the stroke volume, or output of blood by the heart during a single phase of the cardiac cycle. The stroke volume is the difference between the end- diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume. The end-systolic values in the table below are for the left ventricle: The right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESV) normally ranges between 50 and 100 mL.

Members of this genus are very common perennial herbs with a native almost worldwide distribution, and introduced species growing in the few places where the genus is not native. Some are nuisance weeds (and are sometimes called dockweed or dock weed), but some are grown for their edible leaves. Rumex species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species, and are the only host plants of Lycaena rubidus. Description They are erect plants, usually with long taproots. The fleshy to leathery leaves form a basal rosette at the root. The basal leaves may be different from those near the inflorescence. They may or may not have stipules. Minor leaf veins occur. The leaf blade margins are entire or crenate. The usually inconspicuous flowers are carried above the leaves in clusters. The fertile flowers are mostly hermaphrodites, or they may be functionally male or female. The flowers and seeds grow on long clusters at the top of a stalk emerging from the basal rosette; in many species, the flowers are green, but in some (such as sheep's sorrel, Rumex acetosella) the flowers and their stems may be brick-red. Each seed is a three-sided achene, often with a round tubercle on one or all three sides. Taxonomy The genus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. Within the family Polygonaceae, it is placed in the subfamily Polygonoideae. The genus Emex was separated from Rumex by Francisco Campder√° in 1819 on the basis that it was polygamous (i.e. had both bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same plant). However, some species of Rumex subg. Acetosa also have this characteristic, and most other features that are supposed to distinguish Emex are found in species of Rumex. Accordingly, in 2015, Schuster et al. demoted Emex to a subgenus of Rumex. Within the subfamily Polygonoideae, Rumex is placed in the tribe Rumiceae, along with the two genera Oxyria and Rheum. It is most closely related to Rheum, which includes Rhubarb. =Species= Rumex nervosus in Ethiopia , Plants of the World Online accepted the following species.

Uses These plants have many uses. Broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) used to be called butter dock because its large leaves were used to wrap and conserve butter. Rumex hymenosepalus has been cultivated in the Southwestern US as a source of tannin (roots contain up to 25%), for use in leather tanning, while leaves and stems are used for a mordant-free mustard-colored dye. These plants are edible. The leaves of most species contain oxalic acid and tannin, and many have astringent and slightly purgative qualities. Some species with particularly high levels of oxalic acid are called sorrels (including sheep's sorrel Rumex acetosella, common sorrel Rumex acetosa, and French sorrel Rumex scutatus), and some of these are grown as leaf vegetables or garden herbs for their acidic taste. In the United Kingdom, Rumex obtusifolius is often found growing near stinging nettles and there is a widely held belief that the underside of the dock leaf, squeezed to extract a little juice, can be rubbed on the skin to counteract the itching caused by brushing against a nettle plant. This home remedy is not supported by any science, although it is possible that the act of rubbing may act as a distracting counterstimulation, or that belief in the dock's effect may provide a placebo effect. In traditional Austrian medicine, R. alpinus leaves and roots have been used internally for treatment of viral infections. Rumex nepalensis is also has a variety of medicinal uses in the Greater Himalayas, including Sikkim in Northeastern India. Fossil record Several fossil fruits of Rumex sp. have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark. One fossil fruit of a Rumex species has been extracted from a borehole sample of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland. This fossil fruit is similar to the fruits of the extant species Rumex maritimus and Rumex ucranicus which both have fossil records from the Pliocene and Pleistocene of Europe.Macroscopic plant remains from the freshwater Miocene of the Nowy SƒÖcz Basin (West Carpathians, Poland) by Maria ≈Åa≈Ñcucka- ≈örodoniowa, Acta Palaeobotanica 1979 20 (1): 3-117.

He served as the head coach at Mississippi State University (1954‚Äì1955), the University of Washington (1956), and the University of Texas (1957‚Äì1976), compiling a career college football record of 184‚Äì60‚Äì5. In his 20 seasons at Texas, Royal's teams won three national championships (1963, 1969, and 1970), 11 Southwest Conference titles, and amassed a record of 167‚Äì47‚Äì5. He won more games than any other coach in Texas Longhorns football history. Royal also coached the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL) for one season in 1953. He never had a losing season as a head coach for his entire career. Royal played football at the University of Oklahoma from 1946 to 1949. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1983. Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium in Austin, Texas, where the Longhorns play their home games, was renamed in his honor in 1996. Early life \\"K\\" is Royal's given middle name, not an abbreviation. He received it in honor of his mother, Katy, who died when he was an infant. She died of cancer, but because of the stigma surrounding the disease at that time, Royal was led to believe until he was an adult that she had died giving birth to him. Playing career In 1942, during World War II, Royal finished Hollis High School, where he had played football. He joined the United States Army Air Corps, where he played football for the 3rd Air Force team during 1945 and was spotted and recruited by scouts for the University of Oklahoma Sooners football program. He played quarterback and defensive back at the University of Oklahoma under his mentor, coach Bud Wilkinson, from 1946 to 1949. While attending Oklahoma, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Royal was most noted for his prowess as a defensive back, where his 18 career interceptions and his three interceptions in the 1947 game against Oklahoma A&M; (now Oklahoma State) are still Sooner records. Royal's part-time contributions as quarterback had a similar impact, despite the fact that he shared time with Jack Mitchell and Claude Arnold at the position. He threw a 43-yard pass against North Carolina in the 1949 Sugar Bowl. Royal holds the fourth-best winning percentage in school history (minimum 15 starts) with a 16‚Äì1 mark as a part-time quarterback starter. His 11‚Äì0 mark as a starter in 1949 ranks as one of the best seasons in school history. In 1992, Royal was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Coaching career =Early positions= Royal served as an assistant coach at North Carolina State, Tulsa and Mississippi State. He coached the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, and in 1954, he returned to Mississippi State for his first collegiate head coaching job. After two seasons, he left for Washington in the Pacific Coast Conference, but stayed in Seattle for less than ten months. =University of Texas= Royal took over as head coach at the University of Texas (UT) on December 18, 1956.United Press, ‚ÄúRoyal Named New Texas Coach,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 19 December 1956, Volume LXII, Number 94, page 24. The team went from a 1‚Äì9 record in 1956, their worst record ever, to a 6‚Äì4‚Äì1 mark in 1957 and a berth in the Sugar Bowl. Within two years, Royal had the Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl as the number-four team in the country. In Royal's 20 years as head coach, Texas never had a losing season. Royal posted a record at Texas, and his overall record was . Some of his most memorable games were against the Arkansas Razorbacks, and fellow College Football Hall of Fame head coach Frank Broyles. With Royal at the helm, Texas won the school's first three undisputed national championships (1963, 1969 and 1970), won or shared 11 Southwest Conference championships, and made 16 bowl appearances. His 1963 and 1969 teams finished the season undefeated and untied‚Äîsomething no Longhorn team would do again until 2005. Royal's teams were known for being very run-oriented. The quote, \\"Three things can happen when you pass, and two of them are bad,\\" is often attributed to Royal, but Royal himself attributed it to another run-first coach, Woody Hayes. Royal's coaching tactics were the subject of criticism in Gary Shaw's expos√© of college football recruiting and coaching practices, Meat on the Hoof, which was published in 1972, six years after Shaw left the Texas football program. Beginning in 1962, Royal also served as Texas's athletic director. He retired from coaching in 1976 and remained director of athletics until 1980. He then served as special assistant to the university president on athletic programs. During his tenure, Royal oversaw the integration of African-Americans into the UT athletics program. At that time, while UT began admitting black students in 1956 and opening the athletics program to them in 1963, there were no black student-athletes well into the late 1960s. In 2005, Royal retrospectively noted that \\"things they are a-changing. But they weren't changing that quickly around here at the time.\\". He offered a scholarship to Julius Whittier (1950-2018) of San Antonio after the last recipient dropped out due to poor academic performance, and Whittier became the first black student-athlete to play for the Texas Longhorns football team. Whittier went on to graduate from the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 1976 with a master's degree and worked as a chief prosecutor with the Dallas District Attorney's Office. Royal also coached Freddie Steinmark, who was a member of the 1969 Longhorns National Championship team and subsequently died from bone cancer. Steinmark has been the topic of several books and a 2015 movie, My All American where Royal was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart. In 1996, the University honored Royal by renaming Texas Memorial Stadium as Darrell K Royal‚ÄìTexas Memorial Stadium. Royal was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Coach Royal was famous for the inspirational Royalisms he deployed as motivational tools. These sayings include: * \\"God gives talent, size, speed. But a guy can control how hard he tries.\\" * \\"I want to be remembered as a winning coach, but I also want to be remembered as an honest and ethical coach.\\" * \\"You've got to think lucky. If you fall into a mud hole, check your back pocket‚Äîyou might have caught a fish.\\" * \\"Punt returns will kill you quicker than a minnow can swim a dipper.\\" * \\"Don't matter what they throw at us. Only angry people win football games.\\" Death Royal died on November 7, 2012, due to complications of Alzheimer's disease. He is interred at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas. Royal was survived by his wife Edith (b. 1925), whom he married on July 26, 1944. They have a son, Sammy Mack, and two predeceased children, Marian Royal Kazen (1945‚Äì73) and David Wade Royal (1952‚Äì82), both of whom died in automobile-related accidents.

They often drew inspiration from surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular action painting, abstract expressionism, jazz, improvisational theater, experimental music, and the interaction of friends in the New York City art world's vanguard circle. People Frank O'Hara was at the center of the group before his death in 1966. Because of his numerous friendships and his post as a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he provided connections between the poets and painters such as Jane Freilicher, Fairfield Porter, and Larry Rivers (who was O'Hara's lover). There were many joint works and collaborations, particularly between poets such as O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, John Ashberry, and James Schuyler: Rivers inspired a play by Koch, Koch and Ashbery together wrote the poem \\"A Postcard to Popeye\\", Ashbery and Schuyler wrote the novel A Nest of Ninnies, and Schuyler collaborated on an ode with O'Hara, whose portrait was painted by Rivers. Yezzi, David, \\"Last One Off the Barricade Turn Out the Lights\\", a review in The New York Times of The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets, by David Lehman, Thursday, January 3, 1999 Ron Padgett and Ted Berrigan both came to the group from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Koch, O'Hara, Schuyler, and Ashbery were quite different as poets, but they admired each other and had much in common personally: * Except for Schuyler, all overlapped at Harvard University, * Except for Koch, all were homosexual, * Except for Ashbery, all did military service, * Except for Koch, all reviewed art, * Except for Ashbery, all lived in New York during their formative years as poets. All four were inspired by French Surrealists such as Raymond Roussel, Pierre Reverdy, and Guillaume Apollinaire. David Lehman, in his book on the New York poets, wrote: \\"They favored wit, humor and the advanced irony of the blague (that is, the insolent prank or jest) in ways more suggestive of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg than of the New York School abstract expressionist painters after whom they were named.\\" Poetry Concerning the New York School poets, critics argued that their work was a reaction to the Confessionalist movement in Contemporary Poetry. Their poetic subject matter was often light, violent, or observational, while their writing style was often described as cosmopolitan and world-traveled. The poets often wrote in an immediate and spontaneous manner reminiscent of stream of consciousness writing, often using vivid imagery. They drew on inspiration from Surrealism and the contemporary avant-garde art movements, in particular the action painting of their friends in the New York City art world circle such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Poets often associated with the New York School include John Ashbery, Frank O'Hara, Joe Brainard, Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler, Barbara Guest, Ted Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer, Alice Notley, Kenward Elmslie, Frank Lima, Ron Padgett, Lewis Warsh, Tom Savage and Joseph Ceravolo. Visual art The New York School which represented the New York abstract expressionists of the 1950s was documented through a series of artists' committee invitational exhibitions commencing with the 9th Street Art Exhibition in 1951 and followed by consecutive exhibitions at the Stable Gallery, NYC: Second Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1953;Second Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com Third Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1954;Third Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com Fourth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, 1955;Fourth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com Fifth Annual Exhibitions of Painting and Sculpture, 1956Fifth Annual Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture, (poster) , Albertkotin.com and Sixth New York Artists‚Äô Annual Exhibition, 1957.New York Artists' 6th Annual Exhibition.

Their music influenced the music and events of the Fluxus group, and drew its name from the Abstract Expressionist painters above. Dance During the 1960s the Judson Dance Theater located at the Judson Memorial Church, New York City, revolutionized Modern dance. Combining in new ways the idea of Performance art, radical and new Choreography, sound from avant-garde composers, and dancers in collaboration with several New York School Visual artists. The group of artists that formed Judson Dance Theater are considered the founders of Postmodern dance. The theater grew out of a dance composition class taught by Robert Dunn, a musician who had studied with John Cage. The artists involved with Judson Dance Theater were avant-garde experimenatalists who rejected the confines of ballet technique, vocabulary and theory. The first Judson concert took place on July 6, 1962, with dance works presented by Steve Paxton, Freddie Herko, David Gordon, Alex and Deborah Hay, Yvonne Rainer, Elaine Summers, William Davis, and Ruth Emerson. Seminal dance artists that were a part of the Judson Dance Theater include: David Gordon, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Deborah Hay, Elaine Summers, Sally Gross, Aileen Passloff, and Meredith Monk. The years 1962 to 1964 are considered the golden age of the Judson Dance Theater. During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s New York School artists collaborated with several other choreographer / dancers including: Simone Forti, Anna Halprin, Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham, and Paul Taylor.

Orkney Brewery was founded in March 1988 by Roger White at the old schoolhouse in Sandwick, Orkney, Scotland. Atlas was formed in 2002 by Neill Cotton and merged with Orkney in 2004 under the name Highland & Islands Breweries. Highland & Islands was taken over by Sinclair Breweries in 2006. History and development In June 2004, the Orkney Brewery was acquired from its retiring founder by the shareholders of Atlas Brewery to form Highlands and Islands Breweries. Neill Cotton, founder of Atlas Brewery, was Managing Director of Highlands and Islands and drove a series of changes at The Orkney Brewery, including a rebranding and the launch of a very interesting lager. In summer 2006, the company was bought by Sinclair Breweries Ltd. Availability The cask ales are available in various pubs around Britain and at British beer festivals. The filtered bottled ales are sold throughout Europe and in North America. Beers Skull Splitter The Orkney brewery produces cask ale and filtered beer in bottles, and since October 2005, a lager. Dark Island a rich, fruity, vinous dark ale, is the biggest seller. Dark Island has won Champion Beer of Scotland on several occasions. Red MacGregor, a 4% bitter has won the World Cask Beer Gold Medal (BIIA 2001). The same name is used for a 5% premium bitter available filtered in the bottle.

Skull Splitter takes its name after Torfinn Hausakljuv who was nicknamed \\"Skullsplitter\\". Hausakluif was the 7th Viking Earl of Orkney sometime around 950 AD.SkullSplitter at Legends Ltd. Skull Splitter was in the centre of some controversy over its name. The Portman Group, which is the alcohol watchdog group, carried out an investigation based on complaints that the ale had an \\"aggressive theme\\". The Portman Group decided on 23 December 2008 not to uphold the complaint after the brewery launched a strong campaign to save this 20-year-old beer, informing the Group of the beer's namesake.Skull Splitter on the BBCNews of the decision on SkullSplitter The model for the Skull Splitter label was photographer Michael Hockney, who lived in Quoyloo. Hockney was asked by Roger White if he could take a shot for a small promotional poster. A member of Orkney Islands Council, who was a Shetlander, offered his full Viking regalia and himself to provide a suitable Skullsplitter image. At the last minute, the council member decided it was something that an elected official should maybe not do, but insisted White borrow the costume. Hockney arrived at Broch of Gurness to meet White and the model, and was told of the last minute change. White suggested Hockney looked suitably Viking-like and that perhaps he should wear the costume. The Fuji 6x9 camera was set up and Hockney struggled to get his size 10 feet into size 7 deerskins. Roger White also brought his 35mm camera and it was, in fact, White's camera that took the shot.

He was one of the founders of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) on Jan 21, 1888 , serving as its secretary from 1889 until 1906 when he was elected as President of the Amateur Athletic Union from 1906 to 1909. He declined a fourth term and was re-elected to his former position as secretary- treasurer until his sudden death which followed an emergency operation. Sullivan also served as the chairman of the Greater New York Irish Athletic Association in 1903 and on the New York City Board of Education from 1908 to 1912. Biography He was born on 18 November 1862 in New York City. His business career began in 1878 at Frank Leslie's publications. In 1880, he started a paper The Athletics News. His career continued in sports publishing, and sporting goods businesses. His athletics on the track had started in 1877 as a member of the Pastime Athletic Club. In 1888 and 1889 he won the all round championship of the club. He also was one of the most influential people in the early Olympic movement, although his relationship with IOC president Pierre de Coubertin was tense. Sullivan was also an organizer of the Outdoor Recreation League and served as its second president. Sullivan \\"was the advertising representative of A. G. Spalding & Brothers\\", Spalding (company), which provided running shoes, implements, balls and gloves for many sports. 1904 St. Louis Olympic Games Sullivan was a chief organizer of the 1904 Summer Olympics. He decided to allow only one water station on the 24.85 mile course of the marathon even though it was conducted in heat over unpaved roads choked with dust. His ostensible reason was to conduct research on \\"purposeful dehydration,\\" even though dehydration is potentially fatal. The marathon ended with the worst ratio of entrants to finishers (14 of 32) and by far the slowest winning time, 3:28:45, almost 30 minutes slower than the second fastest winning time.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-1904-olympic- marathon-may-have-been-the-strangest-ever-14910747/?no-ist He also organized the Anthropology Days. 1912 Olympic Games The 1912 Summer Olympics allowed female divers and swimmers, but Sullivan, on behalf of the United States Olympic Committee, barred American women from participating even though there were capable women willing to participate. Death and funeral In 1911 he was injured in a train wreck in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He died on 16 September 1914 at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York after an operation on his intestines. For the funeral on 19 September 1914, his body was conveyed from his home, 540 West 114th Street, to St. Aloysius Gonzaga's Church, at 132d Street and Seventh Avenue, where a requiem Mass was held. Legacy James E. Sullivan created The Athletic News in 1880 . The 1914 National Outdoor Track and Field Championships were postponed (Sept 19 to Oct 3) in his honor (after his death). In 1930, the AAU established the James E. Sullivan Award in his honour. It is awarded annually to the best amateur athlete in the US. In 1977, he was inducted into the National Track & Field Hall of Fame.

It is 4.1 miles (6.6 km) west of Haslemere, bypassed by the A3 road, and lies on the Hampshire/Sussex border. It is in the civil parish of Bramshott and Liphook, which also includes Bramshott and Hammer Bottom. Liphook has a railway station, on the Portsmouth Direct Line. The village grew as a coaching stop between London and Portsmouth during the 17th and 18th centuries. It served as a base during the First World War and the Second World War for Canadian troops stationed in Southern England. History =Pre- coaching times= The first record of Liphook is in the Bramshott Manor Court Rolls to one 'Robert of Lupe' in 1281. Then follows Matilda of 'Lhupe' in 1337, William at 'Lupe' in 1365, John at 'Lepe' in 1386, and John Maunser at 'Leope' in 1423. On his death in 1428, John Maunser's tenancy at 'Lepe' between modern London Road and Headley Road is the first identifiable landmark in Liphook. Sir Edmund Pakynham inherited a tenement and land in 'Lepoke' in 1527, and John Hooke bought the manor of 'Chiltle' in 'Lippuck' in 1591. John Speed's map of 1610 shows it as Lippocke. It was also a tuppe. It seems some people escaped from the manors of Bramshott, Chiltlee and Ludshott to Liphook, an area above the marshes around the River Wey, to evade taxes of their local Lords. =The coaching age= Liphook grew further as a coach stop on the London - Portsmouth route. In Tudor times mail was sent from London to Portsmouth via Southampton and the route through Liphook was only used in emergencies, such as the Armada of 1588. The map of 1675 by John Ogilby shows this road bypassing Bramshott and going through Lippock, however the quality of this road was very poor. Originally travellers' needs were catered for by stalls, eventually replaced by the half-timbered houses that exist around The Square. Growth accelerated with wagons being replaced by coaches, and coaching in Liphook was firmly established by 1660. The roads were often unmaintained and unsigned - Samuel Pepys records three journeys by this road in May 1661, April 1662 and August 1668, on the last occasion staying in Lippock: The Royal Anchor coaching inn, The Square, Liphook A coach service from London to Portsmouth started in 1688, which coincided with growth of The Royal Anchor coaching inn, and other 17th century buildings in The Square. The Royal Anchor has a fireback dated 1588 which supports the supposition that there was an earlier building on the site. In the 17th century the Royal Navy considered the road from Petersfield to Portsmouth impassable for heavy goods in winter. Improvements were made in the 18th century to roads and coaches along with the coming of the turnpike. Turnpiking between Petersfield and Portsmouth began in 1710 and between Kingston and Petersfield via Liphook in 1749. The Old Toll House by Radford Bridge in Liphook dates from the 18th century. Highwaymen were a problem in the 18th century as notices in the Royal Anchor show. By 1784 London-Portsmouth coaches carried mail through Liphook. Turnpiking reduced the journey from London-Portsmouth from two days in the 1660s to 10 hours in 1819. Cary's New Itinerary of 1819 records seven coaches on weekdays left London for Portsmouth via Liphook and three during the night. Local tradition has it that Nelson spent his last night in England in Liphook before sailing for the Battle of Trafalgar. George III and Queen Charlotte on their stay gave permission for The Blue Anchor to be renamed The Royal Anchor. =The railway era= Liphook railway station The London and South Western Railway came to Liphook in 1859. The Portsmouth Direct Line was built after the 1840s 'railway mania'. Originally the LSWR route from London to Portsmouth was via a branch from Southampton to Gosport, where passengers then went on the chain ferry across Portsmouth harbour. This lasted until the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway extended their London-Brighton line to Portchester. Initially the LSWR constructed a branch from Woking to Guildford in 1845 then Godalming in 1849, but were reluctant to extend it to Havant. Thomas Brassey, a railway contractor, was granted Act of Parliament to construct a single track in 1853 (doubling was completed on 1 March 1878 ). The first train arrived in Liphook on 24 January 1859, but a dispute between the LSWR and the LBSCR meant full service was not initiated until 7 May. Railways caused the long-distance coaching trade to reduce in the village. The railway station became the hub of short-distance horse-drawn transport, with the blacksmiths shop in The Square flourishing until at least 1918. Chiltlee Manor House, Liphook The railway was originally planned to bypass Liphook, but the Liphook Deviation amendment of the Act of Parliament altered it to its present course. In doing so it bisected the estate of Chiltlee Manor, a split that exists to this day. The northern part remained as fields and the village cricket pitch, until its requisition to become the British Army's Ordnance Supply Unit in 1939. After decommissioning it was sold to Sainsbury's to form the site of their shop, the Millennium Centre and several other housing developments. The southern part was sold to Mary Ann Robb in 1869, who built the house of Chiltlee Place and the surrounding arboretum in 1880. In the 1960s the site was sold to the Berg firm of builders for construction of their housing estate. Liphook's population grew modestly, from 1,367 in 1861 to 1,614 in 1891. The railway did not cause a more substantial increase, since many could not afford to pay the fare for more than an occasional excursion. The Kelly's Directory of 1895 shows far more shopkeepers in Liphook than Bramshott: Liphook had become the predominant centre of the Parish of Bramshott. A few wealthy people however saw the potential of commuter travel, notably Mary Ann Robb and London solicitor William Thomas Longbourn, who bought Foley Manor in 1859. He later sold it to William Barrington Tristram, a former member of the Bombay Council who built the house's Victorian extension. =20th century= From 1916-1928 author and poet Flora Thompson lived in Liphook where her husband was postmaster. Her first work, Bog-Myrtle and Peat, was published in 1921 when she lived in Liphook. The roads 'Lark Rise' and 'Candleford Gate' are named after two of the works. During both World War I and II Liphook was the base for Canadian troops. Recent roads in Liphook have been given Canadian place names to commemorate the armed forces of that country which trained in this area during the World Wars. The cemetery of St Mary's church in Bramshott has a section of Canadian graves, including those of both war dead and victims of the influenza outbreak of 1918. Liphook was one of three sites (with Longmoor and Bordon) occupied by the Royal Engineers' Engineer Stores Depot which, in 1948, employed 700 men. It was established in 1943, originally called Chiltlee Manor Engineer Stores Depot and in 1945 was designated 2 Engineer Stores Depot under the War Office. In 1948 the local MP (for Petersfield), General Sir George Jeffreys, asked the Secretary of State for War, Emanuel Shinwell, whether the men at Liphook were fully occupied as the men themselves stated that they were not. Mr Shinwell promised an investigation. The depot continued its military function until it was closed in 1968. During the hot summer of 1983, Liphook made the news as the hottest spot (33.7C) in the United Kingdom on three days in July. Governance Liphook is in the parliamentary constituency of East Hampshire, and included in the parish of Liphook & Bramshott together with several other settlements nearby. Amenities Liphook village centre =Transport= Liphook was located on both the main road (A3) and rail (Portsmouth Direct Line) links between London and Portsmouth, but is now bypassed by the A3. It is served by Liphook railway station. =Education= Liphook is the location of the public school Churcher's College Junior school, (the Senior school being located in nearby Petersfield) and Highfield Brookham preparatory school. The site previously housed Littlefield school, which was bought by Churcher's and converted. Liphook is also the home of Bohunt School, a top fifty secondary state school. =Sport= Liphook and Ripsley CC. Ripsley House beyond. Liphook and Ripsley Cricket Club play on a ground to the southwest of the village just over the border in West Sussex.

Diagrams have been used since ancient times on walls of caves , but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two- dimensional surface. The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.  Overview  The term \\"diagram\\" in its commonly used sense can have a general or specific meaning: * visual information device : Like the term \\"illustration\\", \\"diagram\\" is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including graphs, technical drawings and tables. * specific kind of visual display : This is the genre that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links. In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more generally: \\"diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and maps, line graphs, bar charts, engineering blueprints, and architects' sketches are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not\\".Michael Anderson (1997). \\"Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning,\\" at cs.hartford.edu. Retrieved 21 July 2008. On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically \\"abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent\\". In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast with computer graphics, technical illustrations, infographics, maps, and technical drawings, by showing \\"abstract rather than literal representations of information\\". The essence of a diagram can be seen as: * a form of visual formatting devices * a display that does not show quantitative data (numerical data), but rather relationships and abstract information * with building blocks such as geometrical shapes connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links. Or in Hall's (1996) words \\"diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning\\".Bert S.

The basic shape according to White (1984) can be characterized in terms of \\"elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity\\". Elegance is basically determined by whether or not the diagram is \\"the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem\\".

The x-axis often describes end-diastolic volume, right atrial pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The three curves illustrate that shifts along the same line indicate a change in preload, while shifts from one line to another indicate a change in afterload or contractility. A blood volume increase would cause a shift along the line to the right, which increases left ventricular end diastolic volume (x axis), and therefore also increases stroke volume (y axis). The Frank‚ÄìStarling law of the heart (also known as Starling's law and the Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism) represents the relationship between stroke volume and end diastolic volume.Widmaier, E. P., Hershel, R., & Strang, K. T. (2016).Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function(14th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education. The law states that the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood in the ventricles, before contraction (the end diastolic volume), when all other factors remain constant. As a larger volume of blood flows into the ventricle, the blood stretches the cardiac muscle fibers, leading to an increase in the force of contraction. The Frank-Starling mechanism allows the cardiac output to be synchronized with the venous return, arterial blood supply and humoral length, without depending upon external regulation to make alterations. The physiological importance of the mechanism lies mainly in maintaining left and right ventricular output equality. Physiology The Frank-Starling mechanism occurs as the result of the length-tension relationship observed in striated muscle, including for example skeletal muscles, arthropod muscle and cardiac (heart) muscle. As a muscle fiber is stretched, active tension is created by altering the overlap of thick and thin filaments. The greatest isometric active tension is developed when a muscle is at its optimal length. In most relaxed skeletal muscle fibers, passive elastic properties maintain the muscle fibers length near optimal, as determined usually by the fixed distance between the attachment points of tendons to the bones (or the exoskeleton of arthropods) at either end of the muscle. In contrast, the relaxed sarcomere length of cardiac muscle cells, in a resting ventricle, is lower than the optimal length for contraction. There is no bone to fix sarcomere length in the heart (of any animal) so sarcomere length is very variable and depends directly upon blood filling and thereby expanding the heart chambers. In the human heart, maximal force is generated with an initial sarcomere length of 2.2 micrometers, a length which is rarely exceeded in a normal heart. Initial lengths larger or smaller than this optimal value will decrease the force the muscle can achieve. For longer sarcomere lengths, this is the result of there being less overlap of the thin and thick filaments; for shorter sarcomere lengths, the cause is the decreased sensitivity for calcium by the myofilaments. An increase in filling of the ventricle increases the load experienced by each cardiac muscle fiber, stretching the fibers toward their optimal length. The stretching of the muscle fibers augments cardiac muscle contraction by increasing the calcium sensitivity of the myofibrils,Klabunde, Richard E. \\"Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts\\". Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2011, p. 74. causing a greater number of actin-myosin cross-bridges to form within the muscle fibers. Specifically, the sensitivity of troponin for binding Ca2+ increases and there is an increased release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In addition, there is a decrease in the spacing between thick and thin filaments, when a cardiac muscle fiber is stretched, allowing an increased number of cross- bridges to form. The force that any single cardiac muscle fiber generates is related to the sarcomere length at the time of muscle cell activation by calcium. The stretch on the individual fibers, caused by ventricular filling, determines the sarcomere length of the fibres. Therefore the force (pressure) generated by the cardiac muscle fibres is related to the end-diastolic volume of the left and right ventricles as determined by complexities of the force- sarcomere length relationship. Due to the intrinsic property of myocardium that is responsible for the Frank-Starling mechanism, the heart can automatically accommodate an increase in venous return, at any heart rate. The mechanism is of functional importance because it serves to adapt left ventricular output to right ventricular output. If this mechanism did not exist and the right and left cardiac outputs were not equivalent, blood would accumulate in the pulmonary circulation (were the right ventricle producing more output than the left) or the systemic circulation (were the left ventricle producing more output than the right). Clinical examples = Premature ventricular contraction = Premature ventricular contraction causes early emptying of the left ventricle (LV) into the aorta. Since the next ventricular contraction occurs at its regular time, the filling time for the LV increases, causing an increased LV end-diastolic volume. Due to the Frank‚ÄìStarling mechanism, the next ventricular contraction is more forceful, leading to the ejection of the larger than normal volume of blood, and bringing the LV end-systolic volume back to baseline. = Diastolic dysfunction ‚Äì heart failure = Diastolic dysfunction is associated with a reduced compliance, or increased stiffness, of the ventricle wall. This reduced compliance results in an inadequate filling of the ventricle and a decrease in the end-diastolic volume. The decreased end-diastolic volume then leads to a reduction in stroke volume because of the Frank-Starling mechanism. History The Frank‚ÄìStarling law is named after the two physiologists, Otto Frank and Ernest Henry Starling. However, neither Frank nor Starling was the first to describe the relationship between the end-diastolic volume and the regulation of cardiac output. The first formulation of the law was theorized by the Italian physiologist Dario Maestrini, who on December 13, 1914, started the first of 19 experiments that led him to formulate the \\"legge del cuore\\" . Otto Frank's contributions are derived from his 1895 experiments on frog hearts. In order to relate the work of the heart to skeletal muscle mechanics, Frank observed changes in diastolic pressure with varying volumes of the frog ventricle. His data was analyzed on a pressure-volume diagram, which resulted in his description of peak isovolumic pressure and its affects on ventricular volume. Starling experimented on intact mammalian hearts, such as from dogs, to understand why variations in arterial pressure, heart rate, and temperature do not affect the relatively constant cardiac output. More than 30 years before the development of the sliding filament model of muscle contraction and the understanding of the relationship between active tension and sarcomere length, Starling hypothesized in 1914, \\"the mechanical energy set free in the passage from the resting to the active state is a function of the length of the fiber.\\" Starling used a volume-pressure diagram to construct a length- tension diagram from his data. Starling's data and associated diagrams, provided evidence that the length of the muscle fibers, and resulting tension, altered the systolic pressure.

Rolling papers are packs of several cigarette-size sheets, often folded inside a cardboard wrapper. Filter cigarette: History 1898 French cigarette paper advertisement poster The first cigarette paper was produces in Alcoy,Spain 1764. Paper cigarettes became popular in the second half of the 19th century, displacing the more expensive cigars and cigarillos.  Composition  Several brands of rolling papers Cigarette paper is made from thin and lightweight \\"rag fibers\\" (nonwood plant fibers) such as flax, hemp, sisal, rice straw, and esparto. The paper is available in rolls and rectangular sheets of varying sizes, and has a narrow strip of glue along one long edge. It may be transparent, colored and flavored. It has a high filler content and a basis weight of 10-28 g/m¬≤. To control the smoking properties, this paper has a porosity that is suited to the type of tobacco and contains additives that regulate burning. One critical paper characteristic is permeability; its primary physical influence is smoke dilution. Among the fillers used are calcium carbonate to influence the permeability and color, magnesium carbonate to improve ash color, or titanium oxide if a particularly white ash is required. Sodium potassium tartrate (Seignette's salt), sodium and potassium citrate are used as a combustion regulator in cigarette paper, increased levels result in faster burning papers. Poly(vinyl alcohol) in aqueous solution is used for cigarette adhesives. Permeability is defined as the measure of the volume of air that flows through a specified area of cigarette paper in a given unit of time. It is measured in CORESTA units. US commercial filter cigarette brands have paper permeability between 14 and 51 CORESTA units. Increased cigarette paper permeability results in increased smoke dilution with air. Fire-resistant cigarettes, which reduce the risk of fire from unattended cigarettes, are made with special paper that includes a plastic compound, ethylene vinyl acetate. If a cigarette made with this type of paper is left unattended, the plastic in the paper will help the cigarette self-extinguish. Other specialty papers for tobacco products are: * Imitation cork paper is a brownish yellow colored paper used for the production of cigarette tips. It has an imitation cork imprint and joins the filter to the tobacco stick. * Filter encasing paper is used for the production of acetate or cellulose filters. The tip paper may be covered with polyvinyl alcohol. * Cigar or cigarillo casing paper holds the chopped tobacco together and serves as the inner casing.  Consumption  =United States= In 2008, Tobacconist Magazine called roll-your-own (RYO) the tobacco industry's fastest growing segment. It estimates that 2-4% of cigarette smokers in the United States, or approximately 2.6 million people, make their own cigarettes. Many of these smokers have switched in response to increasingly high taxes on manufactured cigarettes.Iver Peterson, \\"Roll-your-owns cuts taxes\\", New York Times, October 14, 2002.TTB stats. =Canada= In 2000, a Canadian government survey estimated that 9% of Canada's 6,000,000 cigarette smokers smoked hand- rolled cigarettes \\"sometimes or most of the time\\", 7% smoked roll-your-owns \\"exclusively\\", and over 90% of rolling papers sold in Canada were for tobacco consumption. A more recent 2009 study has shown that approximately 925,000 Canadians roll their own cigarettes. =United Kingdom= According to The Publican, \\"Low price RYO has seen an astonishing rise of 175% in [2007] as cigarette smokers look for cheaper alternatives and to control the size of their smoke\\".The Publican - Home - Tobacco sales drop in Scotland. The National Health Service has reported that roll-your-own use has more than doubled since 1990, from 11% to 24%. Many of these smokers apparently believe that hand-rolled cigarettes are less harmful than manufactured products,BBC, \\"Smoker poll reveals roll-ups myth\\", May 30, 2006 Online copy. although it is equally possible that the increase is due to the steep rise in prices since the early-1990s to the present day. =Thailand= In Thailand, roll-your-own smokers have long exceeded those for manufactured brands;\\"Cigarette Consumption\\", Thailand Health Promotion Institute PDF document. Often, cheaper papers without gum are kept constantly between the fingers while smoking =New Zealand= The New Zealand Ministry of Health reported in 2005 that: 'The ratio of roll-your-own to manufactured or tailor-made cigarettes consumed by New Zealanders has risen over (at least) the past decade, perhaps reflecting price differences between these products, and currently approaching 50 percent overall.'Ministry of Health, \\"Seeing through the Smoke: Tobacco Monitoring in New Zealand\\", Public Health Intelligence: Occasional Bulletin (26), 2005 PDF document.  Taxation  Consumers' switching to roll-your-own has led to a response among certain tax authorities. In the United States, Indiana and Kentucky tax rolling papers. Kentucky set its tax at $0.25 per pack (for up to 32 leaves, larger packs are taxed at $0.0078 per leaf) in 2006 despite complaints from manufacturers. Louisiana Revised Statute 47:338.261 allows up to $1.25 per pack at retail.

Red arrow is path from left ventricle to aorta. Afterload is largely dependent upon aortic pressure. Afterload is the pressure that the heart must work against to eject blood during systole (ventricular contraction). Afterload is proportional to the average arterial pressure. As aortic and pulmonary pressures increase, the afterload increases on the left and right ventricles respectively. Afterload changes to adapt to the continually changing demands on an animal's cardiovascular system. Afterload is proportional to mean systolic blood pressure and is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  Hemodynamics  Afterload is a determinant of cardiac output. Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Afterload is a determinant of stroke volume (in addition to preload, and strength of myocardial contraction). Following Laplace's law, the tension upon the muscle fibers in the heart wall is the pressure within the ventricle multiplied by the volume within the ventricle divided by the wall thickness (this ratio is the other factor in setting the afterload). Therefore, when comparing a normal heart to a heart with a dilated left ventricle, if the aortic pressure is the same in both hearts, the dilated heart must create a greater tension to overcome the same aortic pressure to eject blood because it has a larger internal radius and volume. Thus, the dilated heart has a greater total load (tension) on the myocytes, i.e., has a higher afterload. This is also true in the eccentric hypertrophy consequent to high intensity aerobic training. Conversely, a concentrically hypertrophied left ventricle may have a lower afterload for a given aortic pressure. When contractility becomes impaired and the ventricle dilates, the afterload rises and limits output. This may start a vicious circle, in which cardiac output is reduced as oxygen requirements are increased. Afterload can also be described as the pressure that the chambers of the heart must generate to eject blood from the heart, and thus is a consequence of aortic pressure (for the left ventricle) and pulmonic pressure or pulmonary artery pressure (for the right ventricle). The pressure in the ventricles must be greater than the systemic and pulmonary pressure to open the aortic and pulmonic valves, respectively. As afterload increases, cardiac output decreases. Cardiac imaging is a somewhat limited modality in defining afterload because it depends on the interpretation of volumetric data.  Calculating afterload  Quantitatively, afterload can be calculated by determining the wall stress of the left ventricle, using the Young‚ÄìLaplace equation: \\\\left ( \\\\frac{EDP \\\\cdot EDR}{2h} \\\\right ) where EDP is end diastolic pressure in the left ventricle, which is typically approximated by taking pulmonary artery wedge pressure, EDR is end diastolic radius at the midpoint of the left ventricle, and h is mean thickness of the left ventricle wall. Both radius and mean thickness of the left ventricle may be measured by echocardiography.  Factors affecting afterload  Disease processes pathology that include indicators such as an increasing left ventricular afterload include elevated blood pressure and aortic valve disease. Systemic hypertension (HTN) (elevated blood pressure) increases the left ventricular (LV) afterload because the LV must work harder to eject blood into the aorta. This is because the aortic valve won't open until the pressure generated in the left ventricle is higher than the elevated blood pressure in the aorta. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is increased blood pressure within the right heart leading to the lungs. PH indicates a regionally applied increase in afterload dedicated to the right side of the heart, divided and isolated from the left heart by the interventricular septum. In the natural aging process, aortic stenosis often increases afterload because the left ventricle must overcome the pressure gradient caused by the calcified and stenotic aortic valve, in addition to the blood pressure required to eject blood into the aorta. For instance, if the blood pressure is 120/80, and the aortic valve stenosis creates a trans-valvular gradient of 30 mmHg, the left ventricle has to generate a pressure of 110 mmHg to open the aortic valve and eject blood into the aorta. Due to the increased afterload, the ventricle has to work harder to accomplish its goal of ejecting blood into the aorta. Thus, in the long-term, increased afterload (due to the stenosis) results in hypertrophy of the left ventricle to account for the increased work required. Aortic insufficiency (Aortic Regurgitation) increases afterload, because a percentage of the blood that ejects forward regurgitates back through the diseased aortic valve. This leads to elevated systolic blood pressure. The diastolic blood pressure in the aorta falls, due to regurgitation. This increases pulse pressure. Mitral regurgitation (MR) decreases afterload. In ventricular systole under MR, regurgitant blood flows backwards/retrograde back and forth through a diseased and leaking mitral valve. The remaining blood loaded into the LV is then optimally ejected out through the aortic valve. With an extra pathway for blood flow through the mitral valve, the left ventricle does not have to work as hard to eject its blood, i.e. there is a decreased afterload. Afterload is largely dependent upon aortic pressure.

His writings have been noted as being rooted in several literary genres ‚Äì most prominently weird fiction ‚Äì and have overall been described by many critics as works of philosophical horror, often formed into short stories and novellas in the tradition of gothic fiction. The worldview espoused by Ligotti in his fiction and non-fiction is pessimistic and nihilistic. The Washington Post called him \\"the best kept secret in contemporary horror fiction.\\"Blurb from Ligotti's The Nightmare Factory. Career Ligotti started his career as a published writer in the early 1980s with a number of short stories published in various American small press magazines. He was contributing editor to Grimoire from 1982 to 1985. In 2015, Ligotti's first two collections, Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe: His Lives and Works, were republished in one volume by Penguin Classics as Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal wrote of the reprint that \\"Horror writer Thomas Ligotti is about to enter the American literary canon. Penguin Classics published a volume of Mr. Ligotti‚Äôs short stories, making him one of 10 living writers, including Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo, among the hundreds the imprint has published in the U.S.\\" Ligotti's work received high praise following the publication from the likes of The New York Times Book Review, the Los Angeles Review of Books, The Washington Post, and The New Yorker. Terrence Rafferty contrasts Ligotti with Stephen King, observing, \\"King, the great entertainer, needs the story as the comedian needs the joke, and when he can‚Äôt quite deliver it he dies (in the comedian‚Äôs sense). King is a master of horror, though. When inspiration fails, he has the technique to fake it. Thomas Ligotti is a master of a different order, practically a different species. He probably couldn‚Äôt fake it if he tried, and he never tries. He writes like horror incarnate.\\" Ligotti collaborated with the musical group Current 93 on the albums In a Foreign Town, In a Foreign Land (1997, reissued 2002), I Have a Special Plan for This World (2000), This Degenerate Little Town (2001) and The Unholy City (2003), all released on David Tibet's Durtro label. Tibet has also published several limited editions of Ligotti's books on Durtro Press. Additionally, Ligotti played guitar on Current 93's contribution to the compilation album Foxtrot, whose proceeds went to the treatment of musician John Balance's alcoholism. Personal life He has cited Thomas Bernhard, William S. Burroughs, Emil Cioran, Vladimir Nabokov, Edgar Allan Poe, Giacomo Leopardi, Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka, and Bruno Schulz as being among his favorite writers. H. P. Lovecraft is also an important touchstone for Ligotti: a few stories, \\"The Sect of the Idiot\\" in particular, make explicit reference to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and one, \\"The Last Feast of Harlequin\\", was dedicated to Lovecraft. Also among his avowed influences are Algernon Blackwood, M.R. James, and Arthur Machen, all fin de si√®cle horror authors known for their subtlety and implications of the cosmic and supernatural in their stories. He has also invoked the influence of philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer and Peter Wessel Zapffe. Ligotti has suffered from chronic anxiety and anhedonia for much of his life; these have been prominent themes in his work. Ligotti avoids the explicit violence common in some recent horror fiction, preferring to establish a disquieting, pessimistic atmosphere through the use of subtlety and repetition. Ligotti has stated he prefers short stories to longer forms, both as a reader and as a writer, though he has written a novella, My Work Is Not Yet Done (2002) Ligotti's ancestry is three-quarters Sicilian, one-quarter Polish, a genetic combination he likes to think \\"contributed to the bizarre quality of my imagination and to what has been called its 'universality'.\\" He says that his Polish grandmother's stories, though not horrific, \\"put me in touch with an older and stranger world than I would otherwise have known and that emerged when I started writing stories so many years later\\". Ligotti attended Macomb County Community College between 1971 and 1973 and graduated from Wayne State University in 1978. For 23 years Ligotti worked as an Associate Editor at Gale Research (now the Gale Group), a publishing company that produces compilations of literary (and other) research. In the summer of 2001, Ligotti quit his job at the Gale Group and moved to south Florida. He politically identifies as socialist. Influence In 2003, Wildside Press published The Thomas Ligotti Reader: Essays and Explorations, a collection of essays about Ligotti's edited by Darrell Schweitzer. Author Jeff VanderMeer has penned numerous pieces praising Ligotti's writing, including the introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe. In 2014, the HBO television series True Detective attracted attention from some of Ligotti's fans because of the striking resemblance between the pessimistic, antinatalist philosophy espoused in the first few episodes by the character of Rust Cohle (played by Matthew McConaughey) and Ligotti's own philosophical pessimism and antinatalism, especially as expressed in The Conspiracy Against the Human Race. After accusations that dialogue from Cohle's character in True Detective were lifted from The Conspiracy Against the Human Race, the series' writer, Nic Pizzolatto, confirmed in The Wall Street Journal that Ligotti, along with several other writers and texts in the weird supernatural horror genre, had indeed influenced him. Pizzolatto said he found The Conspiracy Against the Human Race to be \\"incredibly powerful writing\\". On the topic of hard-boiled detectives, he asked: \\"What could be more hardboiled than the worldview of Ligotti or [Emil] Cioran?\\" Bibliography *Songs of a Dead Dreamer (1985, rev. & exp. 1989) *Grimscribe: His Lives and Works (1991) *Noctuary (1994) *The Agonizing Resurrection of Victor Frankenstein and Other Gothic Tales (1994) *The Nightmare Factory (1996).

All three featured stories which ran the gamut from fantasy and science fiction to straight crime dramas of mystery and suspense. Radio Written and directed by Robert Arthur and David Kogan, the radio series was sponsored by Adam Hats. It began on the Mutual Broadcasting System, December 5, 1943, continuing in many different time slots until September 16, 1952. The lonely sound of a distant locomotive heralded the arrival of the sinister narrator (portrayed by Maurice Tarplin), who introduced himself each week in the following manner: :This is the Mysterious Traveler, inviting you to join me on another journey into the strange and terrifying. I hope you will enjoy the trip, that it will thrill you a little and chill you a little. So settle back, get a good grip on your nerves and be comfortable--if you can! Cast members included Jackson Beck, Lon Clark, Roger DeKoven, Elspeth Eric, Wendell Holmes, Bill Johnstone, Joseph Julian, Jan Miner, Santos Ortega, Bryna Raeburn, Frank Readick, Luis van Rooten, Ann Shepherd, Lawson Zerbe and Bill Zuckert. Sound effects were by Jack Amrhein, Jim Goode, Ron Harper, Walt McDonough and Al Schaffer. \\"Behind the Locked Door\\", a popular, much-requested episode which took place in total darkness, was repeated several times during the years. Two archaeologists discover a century-old wagon train that had been sealed in a cave following a landslide. When their Native American guide is mysteriously and brutally attacked, the two, now lost in the darkness, conclude that the descendants of the wagon train are still living in the cave. Only 75 of the original 370 Mysterious Traveler episodes still exist. The popularity of the series spawned other supernatural shows, such as The Sealed Book. With scripts by a Mysterious Traveler writer and Tarplin as host- narrator, The Strange Dr. Weird was a nearly identical program.Passage, Frank M. The Mysterious Traveler log Magazine Luis van Rooten on The Mysterious Traveler Grace Publishing's 1951-52 Mysterious Traveler digest-sized magazine ran for five issues with cover paintings by famed pulp illustrator Norman Saunders. The publisher was David Kogan, and managing editor Robert Arthur also contributed many stories. The first issue (November 1951) carried a welcome from the Mysterious Traveler himself: :This is the Mysterious Traveler, inviting you to join me on another journey into the realm of mystery and suspense. This time the trip is to be made in the pages of a magazine, rather than on the air. Thousands of letters have come to me from the many listeners who enjoy my weekly radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System, urging me to put some of my stories into printed form. :This magazine is the answer. Some of the stories in it will be my own, retold for your enjoyment in fiction form by the finest writers of today. But many of the other stories will be favorites of mine, both new and old, written by the world's greatest craftsmen of the mystery--such men and women as John Dickson Carr, Dorothy L. Sayers, Brett Halliday, Ray Bradbury, Craig Rice, Lawrence Blochman, all of whom you will find in this issue, and dozens of others who will appear in the issues to come. :These stories, both new and old, will be the finest I can collect for your enjoyment. They will have mystery, suspense, inventiveness, color--and above all they will be good reading, just as I try to make The Mysterious Traveler on the air good listening. :I hope you will enjoy this magazine, now in your hands for the first time. I hope also that you will let me know if it satisfies you, what kind of stories you would prefer to see in future issues, the titles of any favorite stories you would like me to bring back into print again, or any other comments you wish to make. Write me at: Studio 4, 105 East 15th St., New York 3, New York.

Short story and biography Anthony Boucher's 1950 detective story anthology, Four-and-Twenty-Bloodhounds, paired each story with a brief biography of the detective. In the case of \\"The Big Money\\" by Robert Arthur, Boucher apologized to the reader: :The most disquieting moment in editing this anthology came when I received the biographical questionnaire filled in by the Mysterious Traveler. In answer to the first blank, born , he had simply inserted: ?. And the succeeding answers were equally disconcerting and not in all cases publishable--though I have forwarded a copy to Miskatonic University for its files. Suffice it that no one--not even his nominal creators, Robert Arthur and David Kogan--knows whether the Traveler is detective, criminal or neither.

The first 13 episodes were broadcast live, and the remainder were pre-recorded. Fred Wiehe and Edward King were the directors, and Norman Rose was heard as both announcer and narrator, opening the show with: \\"Adventures in time and space... told [or transcribed] in future tense...\\" For two months beginning on July 7, 1950 the series was sponsored by Wheaties. Overview Preceded by Mutual's 2000 Plus (1950‚Äì52), Dimension X was not the first adult science fiction series on radio, but the acquisition of previously published stories immediately gave it a strong standing with the science fiction community, as did the choice of well established, respected writers in the field: Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Fredric Brown, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. Beam Piper, Frank M. Robinson, Clifford D. Simak, William Tenn, Jack Vance, Kurt Vonnegut, Jack Williamson and Donald A. Wollheim. Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts adapted most of the stories and also provided original scripts. In Science Fiction Television (2004), M. Keith Booker wrote: :It was not until the 1950s that science fiction radio really hit its stride, even as science fiction was beginning to appear on television as well. Radio programs such as Mutual's 2000 Plus and NBC's Dimension X were anthology series that offered a variety of exciting tales of future technology, with a special focus on space exploration (including alien invasion), though both series also often reflected contemporary anxieties about the dangers of technology.Booker, M. Keith. Science Fiction Television. Connecticut: Praeger Publishers, 2004. The series opened with \\"The Outer Limit,\\" Ernest Kinoy's adaptation of Graham Doar's short story from The Saturday Evening Post (December 24, 1949) about alien contact. A week later (April 15, 1950), the program presented Jack Williamson's most famous story, \\"With Folded Hands,\\" first published in the July 1947 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. With a five-month hiatus from January 1951 to June 1951, the series spanned 17 months. All 50 episodes of the series survived and can be heard today. Later, NBC's X Minus One (1955‚Äì58) utilized many of the same actors and scripts.

However, the early 1970s brought a wave of nostalgia for old-time radio; a new experimental episode, \\"The Iron Chancellor\\" by Robert Silverberg, was produced in 1973, but it failed to revive the series. NBC also tried broadcasting the old recordings, but their irregular once-monthly scheduling kept even devoted listeners from following the broadcasts.

He was the British flat racing Champion Jockey 26 times and is often considered the world's greatest ever jockey. He remains the only flat jockey to have been knighted. Early life Gordon Richards was brought up in the Shropshire village of Donnington Wood (now part of Telford), the son of a Shropshire coal miner. His father reared several pit ponies at their home, and it was in this environment that Sir Gordon fostered his love of the equestrian. He rode the ponies bareback from an early age, then from the age of seven, drove the pony and trap passenger service his family ran between Wrockwardine Wood and Oakengates station. It was at that age no doubt that he developed his unique riding style, using a long rein and an upright stance. He had two brothers, Colin and Clifford, who shared this love of horses and also became jockeys: the latter was a Classic winning jockey. Career After leaving school he took the first step towards becoming a jockey, becoming a stable boy aged 15 at Fox Hollies Stable in Wiltshire, owned by Jimmy White. It wasn't long before his riding skills were noticed by his new employer, who gave him his first ride in a race at Lincoln. Not long after his debut he won his first race at Leicester in March 1921. With the determination and single-mindedness that was his trademark, he achieved his dream of becoming a full-fledged jockey in 1925, and went on to become Champion Jockey in his first year, notching up 118 wins. Early in 1926, five years after Richards' racing debut, disaster struck the Shropshire jockey. He contracted tuberculosis and had to take time out from racing. But it was while he recuperated from the debilitating disease in a Norfolk sanatorium he met Bill Rowell, a fellow patient who was to have a major influence on his life. Rowell proved to be something of a mentor, teaching the young jockey how to cope with the riches that would come his way, as well as his popularity with high society in the class-ridden system that prevailed in Britain between the wars. The two became firm friends. By December 1926, Richards was back in the saddle, and returned to winning ways in the 1927 racing season. In 1932 he became stable jockey to Fred Darling, and that season, with 259 victories under his belt, he broke the record for the greatest number of wins in a year, a record he was to keep for nearly 50 years (he broke his own record in 1947 when riding 269 winners). The following year he set a world record winning twelve consecutive races including riding all six winners at Chepstow on 4 October.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133630/1/index.htm Achievement followed achievement, with Richards winning the 1947 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse aboard Tudor Minstrel by 8 lengths, the largest winning margin in the race since 1900. Despite these huge successes, there was still one race where a win had always eluded him: The Epsom Derby. In 1942 he won 4 of the 5 'Classics' on horses, but still the big Derby win he craved remained out of his grasp. The 1953 Derby occurred on a week of great national, and personal celebration for Richards himself, as he became the first jockey to receive a knighthood. This time Sir Gordon rode Pinza, a huge horse for a flat-thoroughbred at 16 hands high, and he rode a terrific race. Pinza was in second position through much of the one and half mile (2414 m) course, competing against the Queen's own horse Aureole, and sweeping past the Aga Khan III's horse, Shikampur, into first place with just two furlongs (402 m) remaining. The long-awaited win was accompanied by thunderous cheers from the frenzied crowd. Winning The Derby was undoubtedly Sir Gordon's crowning victory, and he was promptly summoned from the winners' enclosure to be congratulated by the Queen. Sir Gordon's riding career ended in 1954 following a pelvis injury, but he continued to indulge his passion for racing, by becoming a horse trainer and advisor. As a trainer his main owners were the partnership of Sir Michael Sobell and his son-in-law Lord Weinstock. They placed their first horse, London Cry, with Richards in 1957 and he went on to win the Camridgeshire Handicap of 1958. He also trained for Lady Beaverbrook when she took up her interest in racing. An early owner was Dorothy Paget and when she died he was an influence in Sobell and Weinstock purchasing her stud (Ballymacoll Stud), breeding and racing stock. Training first at Ogbourne in Wiltshire and then at Whitsbury Stables in Hampshire, he sent out many winners and his best horse was the Sobell/Weinstock owned Reform. This colt won 11 of his 14 starts and his victories included the Champion Stakes, St James Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. In addition he trained good horses such as Sunny Cove, Dart Board, Greengage and Pipe of Peace. His stable jockey for much of his training career was Scobie Breasley and when he retired Edward Hide took over. At the end of the 1970 season he was forced to retire from training. The details were that William Hill wished to restart his breeding operation from Whitsbury (which he leased to Richards). Sobell/Weinstock negotiated to buy West Ilsley Stables from Jakie Astor, but a stipulation of the purchase was that incumbent trainer, Dick Hern, and stable jockey, Joe Mercer, remained in place at West Ilsley. Given this situation he took up the role of Racing Manager in 1971 to Sir Michael Sobell and Lord Weinstock and Lady Beaverbrook and continued as such until his death. In this capacity he worked closely with Hern and was particularly active in the purchasing of yearlings for Lady Beaverbrook. Under his management these owners had tremendous success with horses such as Sun Prince, Sallust, Admetus, Cistus, Troy and Sun Princess (for Sobell/Weinstock) and Boldboy, Bustino, Relkino, Niniski and Petoski (for Lady Beaverbrook). Death and legacy He died in 1986. His funeral service was held at St Mary's, Kintbury, Berkshire, and he was buried at St Mary's Church, Marlborough, Wiltshire. horseracinghistory.co.uk Richards, Gordon (1904‚Äì1986). His legacy lives on in Shropshire today, with the Champion Jockey pub (now demolished) in Donnington named in his honour, and the 'Pinza Suite' in Oakengates Theatre, named after his winning horse. Not until 2002 was his record number of victories in a season exceeded, by jump jockey Tony McCoy. However, McCoy was able to utilise modern technology by flying between tracks and therefore compete in more races than Sir Gordon was able to. Richards' total of 4,870 winners is still a British Record. He also holds the record for the most consecutive winners ridden; 12 (half at a night meeting). He was British flat racing Champion Jockey a record 26 times.

However, they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen. They gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top. 5: Aerotolerant anaerobes do not require oxygen as they use fermentation to make ATP. Unlike obligate anaerobes, they are not poisoned by oxygen. They can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube. A facultative anaerobe is an organism that makes ATP by aerobic respiration if oxygen is present, but is capable of switching to fermentation if oxygen is absent. Some examples of facultatively anaerobic bacteria are Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Listeria spp., Shewanella oneidensis and Yersinia pestis.

The Black Museum is a radio crime-drama program produced by Harry Alan Towers in London. It was broadcast in Europe on Radio Luxembourg, a commercial radio station, and was not broadcast by the BBC until 1991. In 1946 Towers and his mother, Margaret Miller Towers, started a company called Towers of London that sold various syndicated radio shows around the world, including The Lives of Harry Lime with Orson Welles, The Secrets of Scotland Yard with Clive Brook, Horatio Hornblower with Michael Redgrave, and a series of Sherlock Holmes stories featuring John Gielgud as Holmes, Ralph Richardson as Watson and Welles as Moriarty. The Black Museum was based on real-life cases from the files of Scotland Yard's Black Museum. The program was transcribed in 1951 and was broadcast in the United States in 1952 on Mutual. More than 500 of the network's stations carried it. Ira Marion was the scriptwriter, and music for the series was composed and conducted by Sidney Torch. This same music was used for the opening credits of, and incidental music in, the 1955 film They Can't Hang Me, starring Terence Morgan. Orson Welles was both host and narrator for stories of horror and mystery, based on Scotland Yard's collection of murder weapons and various ordinary objects once associated with historical true crime cases. The show's opening began: :This is Orson Welles, speaking from London. :(Sound of Big Ben chimes) :The Black Museum... a repository of death. Here in the grim stone structure on the Thames which houses Scotland Yard is a warehouse of homicide, where everyday objects... a woman‚Äôs shoe, a tiny white box, a quilted robe... all are touched by murder. In 2002, Towers produced The Black Museum for television and hired director Gregory Mackenzie to be the showrunner and director for the anthology series using the original narration by Welles. The adaptation was shot on location in London in a film noir style and the pilot stars Michael York as the Scotland Yard Inspector Russel. Programme format and themes Walking through the museum, Welles would pause at one of the exhibits, and his description of an artifact served as a device to lead into a wryly-narrated dramatised tale of a brutal murder or a vicious crime. In the closing: \\"Now until we meet again in the same place and I tell you another tale of the Black Museum\\", Welles would conclude with his signature radio phrase, \\"I remain, as always, obediently yours\\". With the story themes deriving from objects in the collection (usually with the names of the people involved changed but the facts remaining true to history), the 51 episodes had such titles as \\"The Tartan Scarf\\" and \\"A Piece of Iron Chain\\" or \\"Frosted Glass Shards\\" and \\"A Khaki Handkerchief\\". An anomaly to the series was an episode called \\"The Letter\\" as this was the only story not about murder, but about forgery.  Broadcast history  In the United States, the series aired on the Mutual Network in 1952. It was rebroadcast on KABC, Los Angeles, California, in 1963‚Äì1964 and on KUAC (FM) in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 1967. Beginning May 7, 1953, it was also broadcast over Radio Luxembourg sponsored by the cleaning products Dreft and Mirro. Since the BBC carried no commercials, Radio Luxembourg aired sponsored programs at night to England. In the United States, there was a contemporary programme called Whitehall 1212 written and directed by Wyllis Cooper and broadcast by NBC, that was similar in scope to The Black Museum. It was hosted by Chief Superintendent John Davidson, curator of the Black Museum. It used many of the same picked cases as The Black Museum, and it nearly mirrored its broadcast run. The two shows were different in the respect that while Whitehall 1212 told the story of a case entirely from the point of view of the police starting from the crime scene, The Black Museum was more heavily dramatized and played out scenes of the actual murders and included scenes from the criminal's point of view.

Early life  Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Adler grew up mostly in New York City. She attended The High School of Music & Art (later joined with LaGuardia High School) in New York City.\\"Our Alumni,\\" Alumni & Friends of LaGuardia High School website. Accessed Oct. 31, 2016. Her grandfather, Alfred Adler, was a noted Austrian Jewish psychotherapist, collaborator with Sigmund Freud and the founder of the school of individual psychology.  Education  Adler received a bachelor of arts in political science from the University of California, Berkeley and a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York in 1970. She was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1982.  Journalism and radio  At the headquarters of NPR in Washington, DC, Margot Adler is honored with a memorial bench. During the mid-1960s, Adler worked as a volunteer reporter for KPFA-FM, the Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley, California. After returning to New York City, she worked at its sister station, WBAI-FM, where, in 1972, she created the talk show Hour of the Wolf (still on the air as hosted by Jim Freund), and later another talk show, called Unstuck in Time. Adler joined NPR in 1979 as a general assignment reporter, after spending a year as an NPR freelance reporter covering New York City, and subsequently worked on a great many pieces dealing with subjects as diverse as the death penalty, the right to die movement, the response to the war in Kosovo, computer gaming, the drug ecstasy, geek culture, children and technology and Pok√©mon. After 9/11, she focused much of her work on stories exploring the human factors in New York City, from the loss of loved ones, homes and jobs, to work in the relief effort. She was the host of Justice Talking up until the show ceased production on July 3, 2008. She was a regular voice on Morning Edition and All Things Considered. She was also co-producer of an award-winning radio drama, War Day.  Neopaganism  Adler wrote Drawing Down the Moon,Viking Press 1979; revised ed. Beacon Press 1987, and Penguin Books 1997 a 1979 book about Neopaganism which was revised in 2006.Drawing Down the Moon Spotlight in The Wiccan Pagan Times The book is considered by some a watershed in American Neopagan circles, as it provided the first comprehensive look at modern nature-based religions in the US. For many years it was the only introductory work about American Neopagan communities. Her second book, Heretic's Heart: A Journey Through Spirit and Revolution, was published by Beacon Press in 1997. Adler was a Wiccan priestess, an elder in the Covenant of the Goddess, and she also participated in the Unitarian Universalist faith community.  Death  In early 2011, Adler was diagnosed with endometrial cancer, which metastasized over the following three years. Adler died on July 28, 2014 at the age of 68. She remained virtually symptom-free until mid-2014. Adler was cared for in her final months by her son.

Some phoneticians distinguish upper pharyngeal consonants, or \\"high\\" pharyngeals, pronounced by retracting the root of the tongue in the mid to upper pharynx, from (ary)epiglottal consonants, or \\"low\\" pharyngeals, which are articulated with the aryepiglottic folds against the epiglottis in the lower larynx, as well as from epiglotto- pharyngeal consonants, with both movements being combined. Stops and trills can be reliably produced only at the epiglottis, and fricatives can be reliably produced only in the upper pharynx. When they are treated as distinct places of articulation, the term radical consonant may be used as a cover term, or the term guttural consonants may be used instead. In many languages, pharyngeal consonants trigger advancement of neighboring vowels. Pharyngeals thus differ from uvulars, which nearly always trigger retraction. For example, in some dialects of Arabic, the vowel is fronted to [√¶] next to pharyngeals, but it is retracted to next to uvulars, as in ÿ≠ÿßŸÑ 'condition', with a pharyngeal fricative and a fronted vowel, compared to ÿÆÿßŸÑ 'maternal uncle', with a uvular consonant and a retracted vowel. In addition, consonants and vowels may be secondarily pharyngealized. Also, strident vowels are defined by an accompanying epiglottal trill.

Voiced epiglottal affricate  Haida (Hydaburg Dialect)    } :*A voiced epiglottal stop may not be possible. When an epiglottal stop becomes voiced intervocalically in Dahalo, for example, it becomes a tap. Phonetically, however, voiceless vs voiced affricates or off- glides are attested: (Esling 2010: 695). :** Although traditionally placed in the fricative row of the IPA chart, is usually an approximant. Frication is difficult to produce or to distinguish because the voicing in the glottis and the constriction in the pharynx are so close to each other (Esling 2010: 695, after Laufer 1996). The IPA symbol is ambiguous, but no language distinguishes fricative and approximant at this place of articulation. For clarity, the lowering diacritic may used to specify that the manner is approximant () and a raising diacritic to specify that the manner is fricative (). The Hydaburg dialect of Haida has a trilled epiglottal and a trilled epiglottal affricate ~. (There is some voicing in all Haida affricates, but it is analyzed as an effect of the vowel.) For transcribing disordered speech, the extIPA provides symbols for upper-pharyngeal stops, ‚ü®‚ü© and ‚ü®‚ü©. Place of articulation The IPA first distinguished epiglottal consonants in 1989, with a contrast between pharyngeal and epiglottal fricatives, but advances in laryngoscopy since then have caused specialists to re-evaluate their position. Since a trill can be made only in the pharynx with the aryepiglottic folds (in the pharyngeal trill of the northern dialect of Haida, for example), and incomplete constriction at the epiglottis, as would be required to produce epiglottal fricatives, generally results in trilling, there is no contrast between (upper) pharyngeal and epiglottal based solely on place of articulation. Esling (2010) thus restores a unitary pharyngeal place of articulation, with the consonants being described by the IPA as epiglottal fricatives differing from pharyngeal fricatives in their manner of articulation rather than in their place: Edmondson et al. distinguish several subtypes of pharyngeal consonant.Edmondson, Jerold A., John H. Esling, Jimmy G. Harris, & Huang Tung- chiou (n.d.) \\"A laryngoscopic study of glottal and epiglottal/pharyngeal stop and continuant articulations in Amis‚Äîan Austronesian language of Taiwan\\" Pharyngeal or epiglottal stops and trills are usually produced by contracting the aryepiglottic folds of the larynx against the epiglottis. That articulation has been distinguished as aryepiglottal. In pharyngeal fricatives, the root of the tongue is retracted against the back wall of the pharynx. In a few languages, such as Achumawi, Amis of TaiwanVideo clips and perhaps some of the Salishan languages, the two movements are combined, with the aryepiglottic folds and epiglottis brought together and retracted against the pharyngeal wall, an articulation that has been termed epiglotto- pharyngeal. The IPA does not have diacritics to distinguish this articulation from standard aryepiglottals; Edmondson et al. use the ad hoc, somewhat misleading, transcriptions and . There are, however, several diacritics for subtypes of pharyngeal sound among the Voice Quality Symbols. Although upper- pharyngeal plosives are not found in the world's languages, apart from the rear closure of some click consonants, they occur in disordered speech. See voiceless upper-pharyngeal plosive and voiced upper-pharyngeal plosive. Distribution Pharyngeals are known primarily from three areas of the world: in the Middle East and North Africa, in the Semitic (e.g. Arabic, Hebrew, Tigrinya, and Tigre), Berber and Cushitic (e.g. Somali) language families; in the Caucasus, in the Northwest, and Northeast Caucasian language families; and in British Columbia, in Haida and the Salishan and Wakashan language families. There are scattered reports of pharyngeals elsewhere, as in Central (Sorani) and Northern (Kurmanji) Kurdish, Marshallese, the Nilo- Saharan language Tama, the Siouan language Stoney (Nakoda), and the Achumawi language of California. The approximant is more common, as it is a realization of /r/ in such European languages as Danish and Swabian German. According to the laryngeal theory, Proto-Indo-European might have had pharyngeal consonants. The fricatives and trills (the pharyngeal and epiglottal fricatives) are frequently conflated with pharyngeal fricatives in literature. That was the case for Dahalo and Northern Haida, for example, and it is likely to be true for many other languages. The distinction between these sounds was recognized by IPA only in 1989, and it was little investigated until the 1990s.

Barberi is one of two Barberi-class ferry boats operated as part of the Staten Island Ferry between Manhattan and Staten Island in New York City, besides MV Samuel I. Newhouse. With a capacity of 6,000, she is among the highest-capacity boats in the ferry's fleet. Since her introduction in 1981, she has had a history of incidents, including a 2003 crash that killed eleven people and a 2010 crash that injured thirty-seven. Andrew J. Barberi was named after the longtime coach of Curtis High School's football team, who had died shortly before the ship was commissioned. Barberi coached throughout the 1950s, '60s and '70s and was instrumental in the development of scholastic football on Staten Island. 2003 accident On October 15, 2003, Andrew J. Barberi was involved in a fatal accident. Eleven people died, including one decapitation, and 70 more were injured (including one man who lost his legs), as a result of Andrew J. Barberi colliding with a pier on Staten Island. On March 8, 2005, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) published a report on its investigation into the incident. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the collision was the assistant pilot's unexplained sudden incapacitation, with a contributory cause of the Master's failure to maintain command and control of his vessel. 60 Minutes uncovered that the assistant pilot was short on sleep when he crashed the boat. The assistant pilot tried to commit suicide after the crash and admitted he had passed out on painkillers in the boat's pilothouse. He later pleaded guilty to 11 counts of seaman's manslaughter. The ferry director also pleaded guilty after failing to enforce a rule requiring that ferries be operated by two pilots. Andrew J. Barberi was rebuilt in West Brighton, Staten Island by Caddell Dry Dock & Repair Co. and on July 1, 2004, returned to regular service. 2010 accident =Incident= At approximately 9:00 a.m. on May 8, 2010, Andrew J. Barberi left Manhattan on her regularly scheduled crossing to the Staten Island terminal. The weather was calm with light winds, good visibility, and an ebbing tide. Aboard the vessel were 244 passengers, 18 crewmembers, 2 NYPD officers, and 2 concessionaires. As per standard procedure, both the captain and assistant captain were present in the Staten Island-end pilothouse. At 9:16, as Andrew J. Barberi was passing the Kill Van Kull buoy, the assistant captain began to reduce engine rpm and pitch in preparation for docking. The vessel initially responded as commanded, with AIS data indicating that the vessel had reduced speed slightly. Because Andrew J. Barberi was not equipped with a voyage data recorder at the time of the collision, it is impossible to determine exactly when the vessel failed to respond to the assistant captain's commands. When Andrew J. Barberi was approximately halfway between the KVK buoy and the Staten Island terminal, the captain asked the assistant captain to reduce speed. The assistant captain replied affirmatively and began to input reduced Pitch commands. As the vessel rapidly approached the slip, the captain ordered the assistant captain to input a full reverse pitch command. The assistant captain complied and input the ordered pitch command. At the same time, the captain increased engine rpm in order to produce more astern thrust. At this moment the assistant captain became aware that the propulsion units were not following his commands, so he repeatedly pushed the control levels downward to repeat his astern command. In the engine control room, the chief engineer began to notice that the sounds of the engines were not normal for this stage of the voyage. By watching a television mounted in the control room, an oiler became aware of the impending collision and notified the chief engineer. The chief engineer then ordered the engineering crew members to brace themselves for the collision. Up in the pilothouse, the Captain began to sound the whistle and issue the danger signal. The mate issued a brace command over the vessel's public address system and deckhands began to move passengers away from the vessel's bow. At 0918:33, Andrew J. Barberi forcefully collided with the terminal.The moment of the collision between Andrew J. Barberi and the Staten Island Terminal. As the collision occurred, many passengers who had not braced for impact were thrown to the floor. Eyewitness accounts of the incident mention that some passengers were thrown against glass doors and windows while others appeared to be thrown into the air by the force of the collision. Some passengers appeared to be emotionally disturbed by the incident and were observed weeping after the collision. Because the terminal's shore side transition bridge was free- floating, it is believed that the bridge absorbed some of the collision's energy. As a result of the impact, the transition bridge was lifted to a high of 5 feet above Andrew J. Barberi‚Äôs main deck and shifted back into a security fence. In the terminal, passengers waiting to embark described the collision as earthquake-like, shaking the entire building. Some passengers in the terminal began to run, fearing the vessel would break through the building. Once the vessel came to rest, the assistant captain input a no-pitch, or neutral, command into the propulsion units. After the impact, one of the two NYPD officers on board the ferry radioed for assistance. Upon receiving the officer's call, the NYPD's Ferry Security Division began to mobilize police resources to the scene of the collision. The NYPD also notified the USCG and FDNY. FDNY arrived approximately seven minutes later and began to administer first aid and search for any passengers who may have been thrown overboard by the collision. Around 40 passengers were taken to a local hospital for a variety of injuries. The remaining passengers disembarked via a gangway that had been placed between the vessel's main deck and the displaced transition bridge. Below deck, the vessel's engineers began to check the vessel for damage. The only damage was found above the waterline of the Staten Island end of the vessel. =Cause= Fractured bronze ring inside of a failed solenoid valve from Andrew J. Barberi. The initial discovery of the problem with the vessel's propulsion system occurred when the Barberi's chief engineer went up to the pilothouse after the collision. The engineer found that even though the pitch levers were in the neutral position, the propeller pitch indicator for the New York-end unit read out 50% thrust. This indication was confirmed by the stream of water that was being pushed away from the stern of the vessel. The chief engineer then unsuccessfully attempted to bring the propulsion unit to zero pitch using the pilothouse controls. Control of the propulsion units was transferred to the engine room, where the crew used the units‚Äô local controls to bring the pitch to zero. When the crew later attempted to back the Barberi out of the terminal using these local controls, both propulsion units functioned normally. On May 10, 2010, NTSB inspectors attempted to replicate the problem with the pilothouse controls. Because the vessel was docked during the testing, the units were tested without the engines running. Hydraulic pressure to the units was supplied by electric standby pumps, which limited the maximum attainable pitch command to 75%. When a full ahead pitch command was input from either pilothouse, both units responded normally. When a neutral pitch command was then input, the Staten Island end propulsion unit responded normally to the command, while the New York end unit remained locked at 75% thrust. When control was subsequently transferred to the engine room, both propulsion units responded normally to commands. The investigators then turned their attention to the New York-end's propulsion control panel. In this panel, electric solenoids were used to shift hydraulic valves. These valves sent hydraulic oil to the control cylinders on the propulsion units, shifting the pitch setting of the units. The panel was removed from the vessel and sent to the NTSB's material laboratory. Upon disassembling the ahead/astern solenoids on the panel, investigators found bronze ring fragments. These ring fragments had lodged themselves in the solenoids, preventing their correct operation. Due to the nature of the damage that the rings had sustained, NTSB investigators were unable to determine why they had originally fractured.

CSA was specified by ETSI and adopted by the DVB consortium in May 1994. It is being succeeded by CSA3, based on a combination of 128-bit AES and a confidential block cipher, XRC. However, CSA3 is not yet in any significant use, so CSA continues to be the dominant cipher for protecting DVB broadcasts. History CSA was largely kept secret until 2002. The patent papers gave some hints, but important details, like the layout of the so-called S-boxes, remained secret. Without these, free implementations of the algorithm was not possible. Initially, CSA was to remain implemented in hardware only, making it difficult to reverse engineer existing implementations. In 2002 FreeDec was released, implementing CSA in software. Though released as binary only, disassembly revealed the missing details and allowed reimplementation of the algorithm in higher-level programming languages. With CSA now publicly known in its entirety, cryptanalysts started looking for weaknesses.  Description of the cipher  The CSA algorithm is composed of two distinct ciphers: a block cipher and a stream cipher. When used in encryption mode the data are first encrypted using the 64 bits block cipher in CBC mode, starting from packet end. The stream cipher is then applied from packet start. = Block cipher = The block cipher process 64 bits blocks in 56 rounds. It uses 1 byte from expanded key on each round. Block cipher encryption = Stream cipher = The first 32 round of the stream cipher are used for initialization and do not generate any output. The first 64 bits of data are used as initialization vector during this phase and are left unchanged. The stream cipher then generates 2 bits of pseudo-random stream on each round which are xored starting at bit 64 of the packet. Stream cipher details Weaknesses Were CSA to be broken, encrypted DVB transmissions would be decipherable, which would compromise paid digital television services, as DVB has been standardised for digital terrestrial television in Europe and elsewhere, and is used by many satellite television providers. Most attacks on the pay-TV system have not targeted CSA itself, but instead the various key exchange systems responsible for generating the CSA keys (Conax, Irdeto, VideoGuard, etc.), either by reverse-engineering and breaking the algorithms altogether, or by intercepting the keys in real-time as they are generated on a legitimate decoder, and then distributing them to others (so-called card sharing). =Software implementations and bit slicing= The stream cipher part of CSA is prone to bit slicing, a software implementation technique which allows decryption of many blocks, or the same block with many different keys, at the same time. This significantly speeds up a brute force search implemented in software, although the factor is too low for a practical real-time attack. The block cipher part is harder to bit slice, as the S-boxes involved are too large (8x8) to be efficiently implemented using logical operations, a prerequisite for bit slicing to be more efficient than a regular implementation. However, as all operations are on 8-bit subblocks, the algorithm can be implemented using regular SIMD, or a form of ‚Äúbyteslicing‚Äù. As most SIMD instruction sets, (with the exception of AVX2) do not support parallel look-up tables, the S-box lookups are done in a non-bytesliced implementation, but their integration into the rest of the algorithm is not hampered markedly by the byteslicing. Both techniques are used in libdvbcsa, a free implementation of CSA. =Cryptanalysis= Cryptanalysis is made more difficult as most data is protected both by the block and the stream cipher. Adaption codes can result in packets with some data protected by only the block cipher or the stream cipher.http://sec.cs.kent.ac.uk/cms2004/Program/CMS2004final/p5a1.pdf =Brute force approach= While the CSA algorithm uses 64-bit keys, most of the time, only 48 bits of the key are unknown, since bytes 3 and 7 are used as parity bytes in CA systems, and may be easily recalculated. This allows for possible known-plaintext attacks when combined with knowledge of the underlying plaintext structure. As the first three bytes of the PES header is always 0x000001, it would be possible to launch a brute force attack. Such an attack would reveal millions of possible keys, but still few enough to make it practical to attempt decryption of other parts of the data with the same key in a second pass to recover the true key. =Known-plaintext attack= In 2011, a group of German researchers released an attack on CSA as used in the DVB system. By noting that MPEG-2 padding frequently requires long series of zeroes, leading to entire 184-byte cells being encrypted with zeroes only, it is possible to build up a rainbow table recovering the key from such a known- zero block. (A block would be known to be zero if two blocks with the same ciphertext were found, since presumably both would be zero blocks.) The attack described would require about 7.9 TB of storage, and enable an attacker with a GPU to recover a key in about seven seconds with 96.8% certainty. However, the attack is only effective when such all-zero padding blocks are present (i.e., in scenes with very little movement or noise), and it would be easily mitigated by for instance sending such all-zero cells unencrypted. This differs from the brute-force attack examples already mentioned, in that the plain-text contents of the entire cell is known before the attack, not just parts of a block, which enables the ahead-of-time computation of the rainbow table. =Fault attack= In 2004, a fault attack was published on the block cipher. The basic idea was to introduce a few deliberate faults in the intermediate calculations, making it possible to deduce the last eight round keys. From this, the final key can be computed. While very few faults are needed (on average two or three per round key recovered), fault attacks are usually impractical to carry out, in that it requires the ability to change bits at will inside the hardware of a decoder that already has the key in question.

It is especially important in increasing venous return to the heart, but may also play a role in arterial blood flow. General The skeletal pump is vital in negating orthostatic intolerance when standing. When moving upright, the blood volume moves to the peripheral parts of the body. To combat this the muscles involved in standing contract and help to bring venous blood volume to the heart. The pump is important in affecting the central and local supply of blood output. Venous return, cardiac output, and stroke volume were all increased during exercise experiments, as well as affecting the local muscle being used, blood volume. Arterial blood pumping Between muscle relaxations intramuscular pressure transiently returns to a level below the venous blood pressure and blood from the capillary system refills the veins until the next contraction. It is postulated that this change in pressure may be great enough to draw blood from the arterial side to the venous side. It is hypothesized that this pressure drop during rhythmic contraction actually increases blood flow through the muscle and may be responsible for a portion of the increase in muscle blood flow immediately at the onset of activity.Sheriff D. Point: The muscle pump raises muscle blood flow during locomotion. J Appl Physiol. 2005 Jul;99(1):371-2. While this explanation is attractive because it would explain the readily observable tight coupling between muscle contraction and a rapid increase in muscle blood flow, recent evidence has emerged that cast doubts on this theory. Experiments have shown that a strong muscle contraction can occur without a corresponding increase in skeletal muscle blood flow.Hamann, J. J., J. B. Buckwalter, and P. S. Clifford. Vasodilation is obligatory for contraction-induced hyperemia in canine skeletal muscle. Journal of Physiology (London). 557:1013-1020, 2004. Given the proposed manner of action of the muscle pump to increase arterial blood flow, it would seem impossible for a muscle contraction and skeletal muscle hyperemia to be uncoupled. Another experiment recently was only able to find evidence that vasodilation, not the skeletal muscle pump was responsible for maintaining proper pressure and blood return. However, this might have to do with the lack of rigorous physiological tests thus far used to be able to prove the pump. Experiments have shown the use of passive leg exercises where only vasodilation was responsible for increased blood return.

In most countries, cardiac surgery (involving the heart and the great vessels) and general thoracic surgery (involving the lungs, esophagus, thymus, etc.) are separate surgical specialties; the exceptions are the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and some EU countries, such as the United Kingdom and Portugal. Training A cardiac surgery residency typically comprises anywhere from 4 to 6 years (or longer) of training to become a fully qualified surgeon. Cardiac surgery training may be combined with thoracic surgery and / or vascular surgery and called cardiovascular (CV) / cardiothoracic (CT) / cardiovascular thoracic (CVT) surgery. Cardiac surgeons may enter a cardiac surgery residency directly from medical school, or first complete a general surgery residency followed by a fellowship. Cardiac surgeons may further sub-specialize cardiac surgery by doing a fellowship in a variety of topics including: pediatric cardiac surgery, cardiac transplantation, adult acquired heart disease, weak heart issues, and many more problems in the heart. =Australia and New Zealand= The highly competitive Surgical Education and Training (SET) program in Cardiothoracic Surgery is six years in duration, usually commencing several years after completing medical school. Training is administered and supervised via a bi- national (Australia and New Zealand) training program. Multiple examinations take place throughout the course of training, culminating in a final fellowship exam in the final year of training. Upon completion of training, surgeons are awarded a Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (FRACS), denoting that they are qualified specialists. Trainees having completed a training program in General Surgery and have obtained their FRACS will have the option to complete fellowship training in Cardiothoracic Surgery of four year in duration, subject to college approval. It takes around eight to ten years minimum of post-graduate (post-medical school) training to qualify as a cardiothoracic surgeon. Competition for training places and for public (teaching) hospital places is very high currently, leading to concerns regarding workforce planning in Australia. =Canada= Historically, cardiac surgeons in Canada completed general surgery followed by a fellowship in CV / CT / CVT. During the 1990s, the Canadian cardiac surgery training programs changed to six-year \\"direct-entry\\" programs following medical school. The direct-entry format provides residents with experience related to cardiac surgery they would not receive in a general surgery program (e.g. echocardiography, coronary care unit, cardiac catheterization etc.). Residents in this program will also spend time training in thoracic and vascular surgery. Typically, this is followed by a fellowship in either Adult Cardiac Surgery, Heart Failure/Transplant, Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery, Aortic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Pediatric Cardiac Surgery or Cardiac ICU. Contemporary Canadian candidates completing general surgery and wishing to pursue cardiac surgery often complete a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship in the United States. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada also provides a three-year cardiac surgery fellowship for qualified general surgeons that is offered at several training sites including the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto. Thoracic surgery is its own separate 2-3 year fellowship of general or cardiac surgery in Canada. Cardiac surgery programs in Canada: *University of Alberta - 1 position *University of British Columbia - 1 position *University of Calgary - 1 position *Dalhousie University - 1 position every other year *Universit√© Laval - 1 position every three years *University of Manitoba - 1 position *McGill University - 1 position every three years *McMaster University - 1 position every other year *Universit√© de Montr√©al - 1 position every three years *University of Ottawa - 1 position *University of Toronto - 1 position *Western University - 1 position =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, cardiac surgeons are trained by direct specialty training or through core surgical training. Through the core surgical training route, trainees can apply on their third year for specific training in cardiothoracic surgery. Thereafter, they may choose to subspecialise in areas such as aortic surgery, adult cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, paediatric cardiothoracic surgery, and adult congenital surgery. =United States= Surgeon operating. Cardiac surgery training in the United States is combined with general thoracic surgery and called cardiothoracic surgery or thoracic surgery. A cardiothoracic surgeon in the U.S. is a physician (M.D. or D.O.) who first completes a general surgery residency (typically 5‚Äì7 years), followed by a cardiothoracic surgery fellowship (typically 2‚Äì3 years). The cardiothoracic surgery fellowship typically spans two or three years, but certification is based on the number of surgeries performed as the operating surgeon, not the time spent in the program, in addition to passing rigorous board certification tests. Recently, however, options for an integrated 6-year cardiothoracic residency (in place of the general surgery residency plus cardiothoracic residency) have been established at many programs (over 20). Applicants match into these I-6 programs directly out of medical school, and the application process has been extremely competitive for these positions as there were approximately 160 applicants for 10 spots in the U.S. in 2010. As of May 2013, there are now 20 approved programs, which include the following: Integrated 6 year Cardiothoracic Surgery programs in the United States: * Medical College of Wisconsin * Stanford University - 2 positions * University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill * University of Virginia * Columbia University - 2 positions * University of Pennsylvania * University of Pittsburgh - 2 positions * University of Washington * Northwestern University * Mount Sinai Hospital, New York * University of Maryland * University of California, Los Angeles UCLA - 2 resident positions, 1 Transplant Fellowship; 1 Congenital resident position * University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio * Medical University of South Carolina * University of Southern California - 2 positions * University of Rochester * University of California, Davis * Indiana University * University of Kentucky * Emory University * University of Michigan The American Board of Thoracic Surgery offers a special pathway certificate in congenital heart surgery which typically requires an additional year of fellowship. This formal certificate is unique because pediatric cardiac surgeons in other countries do not have formal evaluation and recognition of pediatric training by a licensing body. Cardiac surgery The earliest operations on the pericardium (the sac that surrounds the heart) took place in the 19th century and were performed by Francisco Romero (1801) Dominique Jean Larrey, Henry Dalton, and Daniel Hale Williams. Pioneers in Academic Surgery, U.S. National Library of Medicine The first surgery on the heart itself was performed by Norwegian surgeon Axel Cappelen on 4 September 1895 at Rikshospitalet in Kristiania, now Oslo. He ligated a bleeding coronary artery in a 24-year-old man who had been stabbed in the left axilla and was in deep shock upon arrival. Access was through a left thoracotomy. The patient awoke and seemed fine for 24 hours, but became ill with increasing temperature and he ultimately died from what the post mortem proved to be mediastinitis on the third postoperative day.Landmarks in Cardiac Surgery by Stephen Westaby, Cecil Bosher, The first successful surgery of the heart, performed without any complications, was by Ludwig Rehn of Frankfurt, Germany, who repaired a stab wound to the right ventricle on September 7, 1896.Absolon KB, Naficy MA (2002). First successful cardiac operation in a human, 1896: a documentation: the life, the times, and the work of Ludwig Rehn (1849-1930). Rockville, MD : Kabel, 2002Johnson SL (1970). History of Cardiac Surgery, 1896-1955. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press. p. 5. Surgery in great vessels (aortic coarctation repair, Blalock-Taussig shunt creation, closure of patent ductus arteriosus) became common after the turn of the century and falls in the domain of cardiac surgery, but technically cannot be considered heart surgery. One of the more commonly known cardiac surgery procedures is the coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), also known as \\"bypass surgery.\\" In this procedure, vessels from elsewhere in the patient's body are harvested, and grafted to the coronary arteries to bypass blockages and improve the blood supply to the heart muscle. =Early approaches to heart malformations= In 1925 operations on the heart valves were unknown. Henry Souttar operated successfully on a young woman with mitral stenosis. He made an opening in the appendage of the left atrium and inserted a finger into this chamber in order to palpate and explore the damaged mitral valve. The patient survived for several yearsDictionary of National Biography ‚Äì Henry Souttar (2004‚Äì08) but Souttar's physician colleagues at that time decided the procedure was not justified and he could not continue.Lawrence H Cohn (2007), Cardiac Surgery in the Adult, page 6+ Cardiac surgery changed significantly after World War II. In 1948 four surgeons carried out successful operations for mitral stenosis resulting from rheumatic fever. Horace Smithy (1914‚Äì1948) of Charlotte, revived an operation due to Dr Dwight Harken of the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital using a punch to remove a portion of the mitral valve. Charles Bailey (1910‚Äì1993) at the Hahnemann Hospital, Philadelphia, Dwight Harken in Boston and Russell Brock at Guy's Hospital all adopted Souttar's method. All these men started work independently of each other, within a few months. This time Souttar's technique was widely adopted although there were modifications. In 1947 Thomas Holmes Sellors (1902‚Äì1987) of the Middlesex Hospital operated on a Fallot's Tetralogy patient with pulmonary stenosis and successfully divided the stenosed pulmonary valve. In 1948, Russell Brock, probably unaware of Sellor's work, used a specially designed dilator in three cases of pulmonary stenosis. Later in 1948 he designed a punch to resect the infundibular muscle stenosis which is often associated with Fallot's Tetralogy. Many thousands of these \\"blind\\" operations were performed until the introduction of heart bypass made direct surgery on valves possible.Harold Ellis (2000) A History of Surgery, page 223+ =Open heart surgery= Open heart surgery is a procedure in which the patient's heart is opened and surgery is performed on the internal structures of the heart. It was discovered by Wilfred G. Bigelow of the University of Toronto that the repair of intracardiac pathologies was better done with a bloodless and motionless environment, which means that the heart should be stopped and drained of blood. The first successful intracardiac correction of a congenital heart defect using hypothermia was performed by C. Walton Lillehei and F. John Lewis at the University of Minnesota on September 2, 1952. The following year, Soviet surgeon Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Vishnevskiy conducted the first cardiac surgery under local anesthesia. Surgeons realized the limitations of hypothermia ‚Äì complex intracardiac repairs take more time and the patient needs blood flow to the body, particularly to the brain. The patient needs the function of the heart and lungs provided by an artificial method, hence the term cardiopulmonary bypass. John Heysham Gibbon at Jefferson Medical School in Philadelphia reported in 1953 the first successful use of extracorporeal circulation by means of an oxygenator, but he abandoned the method, disappointed by subsequent failures. In 1954 Lillehei realized a successful series of operations with the controlled cross-circulation technique in which the patient's mother or father was used as a 'heart-lung machine'. John W. Kirklin at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota started using a Gibbon type pump-oxygenator in a series of successful operations, and was soon followed by surgeons in various parts of the world. Nazih Zuhdi performed the first total intentional hemodilution open heart surgery on Terry Gene Nix, age 7, on February 25, 1960, at Mercy Hospital, Oklahoma City, OK. The operation was a success; however, Nix died three years later in 1963.Warren, Cliff, Dr. Nazih Zuhdi ‚Äì His Scientific Work Made All Paths Lead to Oklahoma City, in Distinctly Oklahoma, November, 2007, p. 30-33 In March, 1961, Zuhdi, Carey, and Greer, performed open heart surgery on a child, age , using the total intentional hemodilution machine. In 1985 Zuhdi performed Oklahoma's first successful heart transplant on Nancy Rogers at Baptist Hospital. The transplant was successful, but Rogers, a cancer sufferer, died from an infection 54 days after surgery. Dr. Nazih Zuhdi, the Legendary Heart Surgeon, The Oklahoman, Jan 2010 =Modern beating-heart surgery= Since the 1990s, surgeons have begun to perform \\"off-pump bypass surgery\\" ‚Äì coronary artery bypass surgery without the aforementioned cardiopulmonary bypass. In these operations, the heart is beating during surgery, but is stabilized to provide an almost still work area in which to connect the conduit vessel that bypasses the blockage; in the U.S., most conduit vessels are harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH). Some researchers believe that the off-pump approach results in fewer post-operative complications, such as postperfusion syndrome, and better overall results. Study results are controversial as of 2007, the surgeon's preference and hospital results still play a major role. =Minimally invasive surgery= A new form of heart surgery that has grown in popularity is robot-assisted heart surgery. This is where a machine is used to perform surgery while being controlled by the heart surgeon. The main advantage to this is the size of the incision made in the patient. Instead of an incision being at least big enough for the surgeon to put his hands inside, it does not have to be bigger than 3 small holes for the robot's much smaller \\"hands\\" to get through. =Pediatric cardiovascular surgery= Pediatric cardiovascular surgery is surgery of the heart of children. The first operations to repair cardio-vascularWikipedia: Coarctation of the Aorta. Coarctation is not cardiac (i.e., heart) but is a narrowing of the aorta, a great vessel near the heart defects in children were performed by Clarence Crafoord in Sweden when he repaired coarctation of the aorta in a 12-year-old boy. The first attempts to palliate congenital heart disease were performed by Alfred Blalock with the assistance of William Longmire, Denton Cooley, and Blalock's experienced technician, Vivien Thomas in 1944 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Techniques for repair of congenital heart defects without the use of a bypass machine were developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Among them was an open repair of an atrial septal defect using hypothermia, inflow occlusion and direct vision in a 5-year old child performed in 1952 by Lewis and Tauffe. C. Walter Lillihei used cross-circulation between a boy and his father to maintain perfusion while performing a direct repair of a ventricular septal defect in a 4 year old child in 1954. He continued to use cross- circulation and performed the first corrections of tetratology of Fallot and presented those results in 1955 at the American Surgical Association. In the long-run, pediatric cardiovascular surgery would rely on the cardiopulmonary bypass machine developed by Gibbon and Lillehei as noted above. =Risks of cardiac surgery= The development of cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques has reduced the mortality rates of these surgeries to relatively low ranks. For instance, repairs of congenital heart defects are currently estimated to have 4‚Äì6% mortality rates. A major concern with cardiac surgery is the incidence of neurological damage. Stroke occurs in 5% of all people undergoing cardiac surgery, and is higher in patients at risk for stroke. A more subtle constellation of neurocognitive deficits attributed to cardiopulmonary bypass is known as postperfusion syndrome, sometimes called \\"pumphead\\". The symptoms of postperfusion syndrome were initially felt to be permanent, but were shown to be transient with no permanent neurological impairment. In order to assess the performance of surgical units and individual surgeons, a popular risk model has been created called the EuroSCORE. This takes a number of health factors from a patient and using precalculated logistic regression coefficients attempts to give a percentage chance of survival to discharge. Within the UK this EuroSCORE was used to give a breakdown of all the centres for cardiothoracic surgery and to give some indication of whether the units and their individuals surgeons performed within an acceptable range. The results are available on the CQC website. CQC website for heart surgery outcomes in the UK for 3 years ending March 2009 The precise methodology used has however not been published to date nor has the raw data on which the results are based. Infection represents the primary non- cardiac complication from cardiothoracic surgery. Infections can include mediastinitis, infectious myo- or pericarditis, endocarditis, cardiac device infection, pneumonia, empyema, and bloodstream infections. Clostridum difficile colitis can also develop when prophylactic or post-operative antibiotics are used.  Thoracic surgery  A pleurectomy is a surgical procedure in which part of the pleura is removed. It is sometimes used in the treatment of pneumothorax and mesothelioma. =Lung volume reduction surgery= Lung volume reduction surgery, or LVRS, can improve the quality of life for certain COPD and emphysema patients. Parts of the lung that are particularly damaged by emphysema are removed, allowing the remaining, relatively good lung to expand and work more efficiently. The beneficial effects are correlated with the achieved reduction in residual volume. Conventional LVRS involves resection of the most severely affected areas of emphysematous, non-bullous lung (aim is for 20-30%). This is a surgical option involving a mini-thoracotomy for patients suffering end stage COPD due to underlying emphysema, and can improve lung elastic recoil as well as diaphragmatic function. The National Emphysema Treatment Trial was a large multicentre study (N = 1218) comparing LVRS with non-surgical treatment. Results suggested that there was no overall survival advantage in the LVRS group, except for mainly upper-lobe emphysema + poor exercise capacity, and significant improvements were seen in exercise capacity in the LVRS group. Possible complications of LVRS include prolonged air leak (mean duration post surgery until all chest tubes removed is 10.9 ¬± 8.0 days. In people who have a predominantly upper lobe emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery could result in better health status and lung function, though it also increases the risk of early mortality and adverse events. LVRS is used widely in Europe, though its application in the United States is mostly experimental. A less invasive treatment is available as a bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. = Lung cancer surgery = Not all lung cancers are suitable for surgery. The stage, location and cell type are important limiting factors. In addition, people who are very ill with a poor performance status or who have inadequate pulmonary reserve would be unlikely to survive. Even with careful selection, the overall operative death rate is about 4.4%. In non-small cell lung cancer staging, stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB are suitable for surgical resection. Pulmonary reserve is measured by spirometry. If there is no evidence of undue shortness of breath or diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and the FEV1 exceeds 2 litres or 80% of predicted, the person is fit for pneumonectomy. If the FEV1 exceeds 1.5 litres, the patient is fit for lobectomy. There is weak evidence to indicate that participation in exercise programs before lung cancer surgery may reduce the risk of complications after surgery.  Complications  A prolonged air leak (PAL) can occur in 8-25% of people following lung cancer surgery. This complication delays chest tube removal and is associated with an increased length of hospital stay following a lung resection (lung cancer surgery). The use of surgical sealants may reduce the incidence of prolonged air leaks, however, this intervention alone has not been shown to results in a decreased length of hospital stay following lung cancer surgery. There is no strong evidence to support using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation following lung cancer surgery to reduce pulmonary complications.

Considered the patron saint of speedy cases, he is commemorated by the Catholic Church on 19 April.  Hagiography  Expeditus was probably born in Armenia. He was a Christian martyr, but not much else is known about him.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúHermogenes, Caius, Expeditus, Aristonicus, Rufus and Galatas‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921.

If he was stationed at Melitene at the beginning of the fourth century, he would likely have been a member of the Legio XII FulminataM‚ÄôElderry, R. Knox. \\"The Legions of the Euphrates Frontier,\\" Classical Quarterly 3 (1909): 44‚Äì53 The earliest indication of devotion to St. Expeditus comes only from the second half of the eighteenth century. He was mentioned briefly in 1675 in the Acta sanctorum volume for April. However, according to Delehaye, the word \\"Expeditus\\" is a misreading of \\"Elpidius\\". The name \\"Expeditus\\" has provoked puns, so he has become the saint of rapidity. At first, he was invoked for urgent causes; he has since become the patron of dealers, sailors, students, and examinees; he is also implored for success in lawsuits. Given that \\"Expeditus\\" is Latin for a soldier without marching pack, i.e. a soldier with light equipment, this saint may be an anonymous individual known by his profession. His cult was already developed in Turin, Italy, in the Middle Ages.  Roman Catholic veneration  = Legends = According to tradition, Expeditus was a Roman centurion in Armenia who became a Christian and was beheaded during the Diocletian Persecution in AD 303\\\\. The day he decided to become a Christian, the Devil took the form of a crow (a snake in some versions of the legend) and told him to defer his conversion until the next day. Expeditus stamped on the bird and killed it, declaring, \\"I'll be a Christian today!\\" Expeditus was included in martyrologies in Italy before 1781. There was a tradition that Expeditus could be called upon to help settle overly long legal cases. His feast of April 19 is widely celebrated. Expedite is venerated in Europe and strongly in Latin America. Brazil has ceremonies in S√£o Paulo and crowds attending ceremonies to mark his April 19 feast day can reach in the hundreds of thousands. Many stories circulated about the origin of the cultus of Expeditus. One states that it began when a package marked expedite (meaning 'be ready' or alternately 'loosen') arrived with unidentified relics or statues. The recipients assumed that the statuary or relics belonged to an Expeditus, and so veneration began. Such an account is set in France in 1781. A case containing the relics of a saint, who was formerly buried in the Denfert-Rochereau catacombs of Paris, was delivered at a convent in the city. The senders had written exp√©dit on the case, to ensure fast delivery of the remains. The nuns assumed that \\"Exp√©dit\\" was the name of a martyr, and prayed for his intercession. When their prayers were answered, veneration spread rapidly through France and on to other Roman Catholic countries.\\"Saint Expeditus\\", La Reunion Another version of the story takes place in New Orleans, Louisiana, which was strongly influenced by French Catholic culture through the colonial period. This account says that Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel (New Orleans) received a large shipment of statues of various saints, and that one case lacked an identifying label. It was labeled \\"Expedite\\" (Exp√©dit in French), so the residents assumed that must be the saint's name. Exp√©dit still figures prominently in Louisiana Creole folklore and is revered through amulets, flowers, candles, and intercessory prayers. = Iconographical depiction = Expeditus' typical depiction in artwork is as a young Roman centurion. The soldier is squashing a crow beneath his right foot and bearing a clock in early images. Later depictions have Expeditus holding a cross, inscribed with the Latin word hodie (\\"today\\"). A banderole with the word cras (\\"tomorrow\\" in Latin) emerges from the crow's mouth. Although in the English language a crow's cry is rendered as \\"caw caw,\\" in Italian the sound is \\"cra cra.\\", and Latin version was \\"cras cras\\".  R√©union Island  Roadside altars dedicated to Exp√©dit are common in R√©union and always painted red. Exp√©dit has a significant folk following on the French island of R√©union off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean. Stories about the origin of his veneration follow the typical formula: a mysterious parcel marked with expedit arrived as an aid to instill pious virtues in the people. Another version says that Exp√©dit acquired his name through his help in placing vengeful curses. Decapitated statues of the saint are often found, the defacement inflicted in anger for a request not carried out, or in order to break an existing curse. Road-side altars dedicated to Exp√©dit can be as small as a box containing a small statue of the saint, or as large as a hut, containing multiple statues, candles, and flowers. In all cases, these altars are painted a bright red. Also common are ex-votos thanking Exp√©dit for wishes granted and favors received. In R√©union, the cult of Saint Exp√©dit has been syncretic, with Roman Catholicism absorbing other beliefs from Madagascar or India. Exp√©dit is a popular saint, revered by Reunionnais regardless of age or religion. As the worship of Exp√©dit is officially considered taboo, people do not generally visit the altars in the open. But, the altars are widespread on the island and obviously well-tended, showing that the cult is active.  Churches in the world  There are churches dedicated to Expeditus all over the world:  Chile  Himnos mil al glorioso Expedito, que su sangre en la Armenia verti√≥, cuyo nombre en el cielo fue escrito, y de m√°rtir el laurel alcanz√≥. ‚ÄîHimno a San Expedito A thousand hymns to glorious Expeditus, Who shed his blood in Armenia, Whose name was written in heaven, And gained the laurel of martyrdom. ‚ÄîHymn to Saint Expeditus Veneration in Chile is said to have begun when a devotee of Expeditus (or locally in Spanish, San Expedito) brought an image of him to Vi√±a del Mar, one of the most popular beach cities of Chile. She petitioned some local priests for help to have a small church built for him. It is said that local authorities initially rejected the idea, but the priests and the devout lady prayed to Expeditus, and in less than nine days they had the approval. Since then, the cult of San Expedito has become increasingly popular in Chile; from rich to poor, people pray novenas to him. The shrine in the Re√±aca sector of Vi√±a is a rather popular pilgrimage site, especially during summer.

Description  The common name of the rough-snouted giant gecko refers to the enlarged scales that cover its snout. Other characteristics of this gecko include broad toes and a prehensile tail. the rough-snouted giant gecko has a mottled color pattern, generally a grayish-green to brown mixed with white. Its body length (BDL) is usually around , making it a large gecko species, with its tail being roughly the same length.  Behavior and habitat  The rough-snouted giant gecko is a nocturnal species, hunting in the nighttime and taking shelter in the daytime. It lives in forests, mostly in tropical and subtropical climates but also in forests with evergreen trees. It exhibits ovoviviparity, causing it to have a lower reproductive rate than other species in its genus. Like all Rhacodactylus geckos, the rough-snouted giant gecko is an omnivore. Its diet consists mainly of insects and fruit, and can include as well small lizards and nestling birds and rodents.  Distribution  The rough-snouted giant gecko lives only in several small areas in New Caledonia. Sparse populations are known from Province Sud and Province Nord, specifically in Ile des Pins and small parts of Grand Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. Its occupies a total of 149 km2 of land up to above sea level. Although the exact population trend of the rough-snouted giant gecko is unknown, both its range and population size are declining for a number of reasons. Habitat loss is one of its major threats, specifically due to wildfires, larger animals such as pigs destroying its habitat, and humans clearing its forests in favor of farmland. In addition, rodents and cats were introduced to the area, which prey on the gecko; fire ants (i.e. Wasmannia auropunctata) are a danger as well. The species has also been collected and traded illegally in some areas, sometimes being used as a pet. Although some of the areas it lives in are protected, no conservation actions are taking place for the species. The decline of its population and its small distribution cause it to be listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and has been assessed as vulnerable by Endemia.  Breeding  The rough-snouted giant gecko is the only Rhacodactylus gecko that gives live birth. It is sometimes seen in captivity and as an arboreal species, requires a vertically oriented terrarium. Males should be housed separately or as a part of a breeding pair or trio with females. Although males housed together will often fight, females are social and can be housed together.  Taxonomy  The description of the species was published by Jos√© Vicente Barbosa du Bocage in 1873.Bocage, J. V. Barboza du. 1873. M√©langes erp√©tologiques. l.

General Hackett's scenario takes place in 1985; Coyle never specifies the year, but it is assumed to take place in the late 1980s. While Hackett's book emphasizes strategy and world politics, Coyles features the experiences of the tank crews and infantrymen fighting on the front lines. The novel achieved best-selling status and became a series of comic books, an Origins Award-winning board wargame and later a video game. In 2015, it was adapted as a sister scenario for the Flames of War wargame. Plot summary The novel is set in West Germany and East Germany in the months of August and September; the year is unspecified. Team Yankee (\\"Y\\" in the ICAO and NATO phonetic alphabet) is an armor-heavy company-sized unit (a \\"Team\\" in Army parlance). There is nothing special about this team; it is an average company- sized U.S. unit in an average battalion of the Regular Army. Team Yankee is composed of First Platoon (Lieutenant Murray Weiss), Second Platoon (Second Lieutenant McAllister), Mech(anized Infantry) Platoon (Staff Sergeant Polgar), and Third Platoon (Second Lieutenant Gerry Garger). Captain Sean Bannon is company commander; First Lieutenant Robert Uleski is the executive officer; and company first sergeant is First Sergeant Raymond Harrert. Captain Bannon is 27 years old, married and has three children. He studied military history, with a graduate degree, but is seen as an average officer; Coyle notes in the preface that Bannon will probably never rise in rank above lieutenant colonel. The team has 10 M1 Abrams tanks, 5 M113 armored personnel carriers, and 2 M901 ITV TOW missile vehicles. The infantry is armed with Dragon antitank missiles and 66-millimeter LAWs. The Team also has a M113 AMEV (Armored Medical Evacuation Vehicle) and an M88 recovery vehicle. There are four M1s in each tank platoon, numbered 11, 12, 13, 14, 21... to 34. The XO's tank is numbered 55; the CO's tank 66. The parent unit of Team Yankee is the First Battalion, 4th Armor. Currently it is part of Task Force 3-78 Mechanized Infantry, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Reynolds. TF 3-78 is formed from the First Battalion, 78th Infantry. The brigade commander is Colonel Brunn. The task force is composed of Team Yankee, C Company (Captain Craven) a standard infantry company, D Company, and another armor-heavy Team Bravo. In addition, there is an artillery support team (a FIST) (Second Lieutenant Rodney Unger) attached. =Prologue= The prologue begins with a series of quotations from international news sources listing the deteriorating international situation between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly in the Persian Gulf, from July 15 to August 1, when NATO forces are mobilized and moved to the inter-German frontier. =Chapter 1: Stand-To= (August 3, early morning) The novel begins with Team Yankee deployed forward towards the frontier with the German Democratic Republic. Captain Bannon is awakened by a radio check from his Third Platoon Leader, Lieutenant Garger‚Äîthe third straight day Garger has used his radio to break radio silence. Unable to go back to sleep, Bannon inspects his unit and meets the other principal characters of the novel. He finds Garger, berates him, and decides that with a war coming on, Garger would need to be replaced as a liability. Meanwhile, at the Army base, Pat Bannon, Sean's wife, understands that the possibility of war is high, and prepares to evacuate her small children while exercising the informal leadership over the other Army wives of Team Yankee. =Chapter 2: First Battle= (August 3, 0730 hours) Colonel Reynolds inspects the forward positions of his task force, including Team Yankee, when the war starts. The Soviets push through the armored cavalry screen and attack the team, in dug in positions under cover. Team Bravo's company commander is killed in combat. Team Yankee repels the Soviet attack. To Captain Bannon's pleasant surprise, his problem lieutenant is proving to be quite competent in combat. At the base, Pat serves as the informal head of Team Yankee's dependents. She makes a trip into the nearest town to make sure Sue Garger, Gerry's wife, is recovered. The roads are choked with military and refugee traffic. =Chapter 3: Change of Mission= (August 3, late afternoon/evening) Pat Bannon, her children, and all the other dependents make it to Rhein-Main Air Base, where they await evacuation. As soon as an aircraft lands and offloads U.S. reinforcements, dependents are loaded on the plane. A Soviet air strike occurs while the dependents wait; Pat and her children must run past dead civilians to make the flight. Meanwhile, the task force and the Team recover from the first firefight. Bannon finds that the attitude of those who have actually seen combat differs from the staff, who are more enthusiastic about the war. =Chapter 4: Into the Vacuum= (August 4, morning) Team Yankee is ordered to attack Hill 214 with C Company in support. There is confusion in orders; Major Jordan, the battalion S-3, orders the attack be halted, while Colonel Reynolds, the battalion commander, orders Bannon to attack. 2LT McAllister, in Tank 21, is killed during the attack. =Chapter 5: Hunter and Hunted= (August 4, daytime) In the fighting, Bannon's tank, 66, is crippled and his driver is killed. The surviving three crewmen in 66 defeat three T-62 tanks, which did not suspect 66 was still in action; the crew destroys 66 to prevent its capture. Bannon rejoins the Team and takes over Lt. Uleski's tank 55. C Company never arrives and the Team is forced to fight to hold Hill 214 on its own. =Chapter 6: On The Razor's Edge= (August 4/5) Team Yankee holds off an attack by a Soviet battalion on Hill 214 during the night. Bannon's loader, PFC Richard Kelp, and Private McCauley volunteer to lead a Dragon gunner to engage the enemy on foot. The Dragon gunner is killed and Kelp and McCauley race against time to destroy a T-72 before it destroys them. Kelp is later awarded a Silver Star for his efforts. =Chapter 7: Check and Checkmate= (August 5, 0530 hours) The Team was scheduled to withdraw at 0330 to U.S. lines, but every man in the company, fatigued from the fighting, falls asleep. Bannon wakes up two hours later, wakes up his tank crew and platoon leaders to the universal chorus of \\"Oh, shit!\\" Bannon works out a way that the Team can withdraw in daylight with minimal casualties. =Chapter 8: R and R= The Team reaches the nearest town, where, to his fury, Bannon finds soldiers from C Company lounging around. Bannon reports to the task force commander; the Team is placed in reserve, where it can recover and receive reinforcements. 2nd Lt. Avery, an Armor School classmate of 2nd Lt Garger's, reports as Lt McAllister's replacement. Avery is puzzled by the slightly distant reception he gets from the Team's officers, including Garger. =Chapter 9: Deep Attack= (August 8 to 11) Lt. Avery, who has yet to enter combat, finds himself isolated from the other members of the Team. He finds himself even more isolated when the Team starts to paint kill rings on the barrels of each tank. The brigade to which Team Yankee belongs is ordered to follow up a West German counterattack into East Germany though the Thuringer Wald towards Leipzig and Berlin to cut off the Soviet offensive against the Northern Army Group. Because of the Team's combat experience, Bannon is ordered to lead the attack. Bannon expresses doubts to Colonel Reynolds that the rest of the battalion, in particular C Company, can carry out their role in supporting the armor teams; he is promised that there will be no more \\"rat-fucks\\". The attack is delayed because the enemy, a Polish T-55 tank battalion, launches its attack first, which gives the Team a chance to fight from defensive cover. The Poles fall back and the Task Force pursues. Avery gets his first kill. =Chapter 10: Red Dawn= (August 11, morning) The Task Force attack stops to consolidate its gains; the Polish unit that was scattered by Team Yankee reforms and attacks C Company. The Task Force, assisted by a German company, moves to support Captain Cravin's company. In the fight, the battalion XO is hit and taken out of action. D Company, Team Bravo, and the German unit, assisted by U.S. artillery, crush the Polish battalion. The Task Force halts to reorganize. Bannon sends the Mech Platoon to secure the nearest town. An East German teenager, apparently a member of the Free German Youth, wounds one of Polgar's infantrymen with an AK-47 rifle and is killed immediately. =Chapter 11: Counterattack= Lt. Avery, in Tank 21, is wounded in an air attack by a Soviet helicopter. First Sergeant Harrert and the maintenance crew salvage the tank, grimly noting it would be back in combat in 24 hours. The task force headquarters is attacked, severely wounding Colonel Reynolds and cutting off the XO, Major Jordan, from communicating with the Task Force; Bannon finds himself in command of the Task Force and leads three companies to defeat the Soviet counterattack and rescue the Task Force staff. =Chapter 12: \\"They Came in the Same Old Way\\"= The surviving Task Force staff, led by Major Jordan, resume command. C Company is effectively wiped out and its survivors are integrated with D Company. The Task Force plans to ambush a Soviet battalion heading westward into their position, centered on an East German town. Jordan plans a reverse slope defense, not attacking the Soviets at the logical choke point. The Soviet attackers, harassed by the Task Force scout platoon and U.S. artillery-delivered mines, fail to take the town or the hills to the north of the valley. The Soviet commander moves south, into Bannon's Team's guns. When asked to give his after-action report, Bannon flippantly quotes the Duke of Wellington, \\"They came, you know, in the same old way and we beat them in the same old way.\\" =Chapter 13: To the Saale= NATO as a whole, and the U.S. in particular, are running short of equipment and manpower. Units that are no longer capable of going on the offensive, or are not holding key terrain, are stripped of their most effective units. Team Yankee is thus moved from Task Force 3-78 to Task Force 1-4 Armored, which is their parent battalion, to continue the attack into Leipzig and Berlin. The Team is assigned a screening role to the main effort, and is ordered to feint as if they intend to capture a bridge over the Saale River. However, due to speed of their attack and a divided command between the Soviet Army and the KGB, Lt. Weiss' platoon is able to capture the bridge intact. =Chapter 14: The Day After= The next day, Bannon finds out that the Soviets have launched a nuclear attack on the city of Birmingham, England; NATO retaliates by destroying the city of Minsk, Belarus. The Task Force is ordered to prepare for nuclear warfare (by dispersion, deeper cover, and protection against the effects of a blast on electronics and optics). Bannon immediately orders a tightening on hygiene and equipment maintenance to lessen the long-term effects of nuclear war. Bannon prepares for the next attack when the news comes that a cease-fire was declared and the war is over. =Epilogue= The cease-fire holds. Life slowly resumes a routine closer to peacetime. A National Guard division relieves Bannon's division, and Bannon returns to his quarters only two months after he left, to reconnect with his family life. Major themes The novel has as a theme the actions of a company-sized armor unit of the United States Army in the World War III scenario as depicted by General Sir John Hackett in his novel, The Third World War. It also deals with, to a lesser degree, the reactions of men facing combat for the first time, and how they react after seeing combat. The novel also refers to \\"Company Commander\\", the WW2 infantry service memoir by Charles B. Macdonald... a recollection of Macdonald's service as an infantry officer. Non-fiction books describing similar experiences to those of the fictional Team Yankee are \\"Brazen Chariots\\" by Robert Crisp, which describes his service in the North African armored campaigns in the Second World War, and \\"Heights of Courage\\" by Avigdor Kahalani, an account of his experiences in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Significance Team Yankee was Coyle's first novel, and its success made Coyle a prominent writer in the field of military fiction.

Comedian Will Ferrell played Bush and when asked by a mock debate moderator to \\"sum up, in a single word, the best argument for his candidacy\\", replied \\"strategery\\" (a mock-Bushism playing on the word \\"strategy\\"), thus satirizing Bush's reputation for mispronouncing words. The episode was later released as part of a video tape titled Presidential Bash 2000. Becoming a Bush catchphrase After the 2000 presidential election, people inside the Bush White House reportedly began using the term as a joke, and it later grew to become a term of art among them meaning oversight of any activity by Bush's political consultants. Bush's strategists also came to be known within the White House as \\"The Department of Strategery\\", or the \\"Strategery Group\\". A February 9, 2001 transcript of a CNN interview shows Bush using the term, presumably as an intentional nod to the comedy sketch. Affectionately embracing satirical portrayals has been a Bush tactic at other times as well, such as when he presented a self-parodying slide show at the May 2004 Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner about looking for weapons of mass destruction in the Oval Office after the political comic strip Doonesbury satirically portrayed him on a similar comical search. The term is now widely used in comic and popular discourse across the political spectrum. Rush Limbaugh picked up the usage soon after the SNL airing. A trial exhibit from the 2007 \\"Scooter\\" Libby trial included the term, in Libby's daily schedule for June 10, 2003, which showed that Libby had a 6:00 pm \\"Strategery Meeting\\" scheduled to last 90 minutes.Defense Exhibit DX1030 - Scooter Libby's Schedule, June 10, 2003 In a 2017 interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Bush recalled a joke argument with SNL's Lorne Michaels about whether an SNL writer or Bush himself had actually coined the term. Other uses Sarah Palin used the term in an interview with Bill O'Reilly on his television show. Speaking of Charles Krauthammer and his political contacts, Palin commented \\"they're meeting people and they're doing their strategery\\". The term is also a centerpiece of the fictitious firm Strategery Capital Management, LLC, a satirical website, which mocks the Treasury's $700 billion \\"Troubled Asset Rescue Plan\\" (which itself is a spoof of the real-world Troubled Asset Relief Program, which Bush signed into law in 2008). A White House reporter, during a September 29, 2009, press briefing, began a question for press secretary Robert Gibbs with \\"From the standpoint of leverage or strategery...\\" The question, about Iran, drew laughs and a quip from Gibbs. Shepard Smith, on his evening news program The FOX Report with Shepard Smith on July 10, 2012, described London official's quoted \\"overall strategery\\" in placing anti-aircraft missiles on apartment buildings during the London Olympics.
