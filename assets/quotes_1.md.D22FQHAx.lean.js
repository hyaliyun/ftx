Its two engines and 90-degree articulation made it one of the most unorthodox tractors ever built. Development During the 1950s farmers in the United Kingdom in need of high-power tractors had few options. Essex farmer George Pryor developed an ingenious solution to the problem by creating his own tractor. He did this by purchasing two Fordson tractors, removing the front wheels and axles and linking the two by means of a turntable which provided the steering action powered by hydraulic rams. This left him with a double-engined four- wheel—drive tractor capable of producing more power and outperforming any of the conventional tractors on the UK market at the time. Commercial production Local Fordson dealers Ernest Doe & Sons agreed to build an improved version, the first one was completed in 1958 and called the Doe Dual Power, later changed to Doe Dual Drive and abbreviated to Triple-D. Doe Dual Drive 130 on show at the Codicote Steam and Country Show 2009 The first Doe Triple-D used two Fordson Power Major units producing , the later Triple-D 130 used two Ford 5000 tractors increasing the power output to over and the Triple-D 150 was based on Ford Force 5000 tractors producing . The vast majority of Triple-Ds were sold in the UK, but a number were exported to the United States and elsewhere. Disadvantages The main disadvantage with the Triple-D was the lack of suitable implements for such a powerful tractor, this meant that Ernest Doe & Sons also had to develop and build a range of implements to sell with the tractors. Other disadvantages stemmed from the use of two engines, this made controlling the tractor more difficult because of the need for two gearboxes. There were two engines and gearboxes to maintain and repair and the probability of breakdowns was increased. End of production By the late 1960s several companies had developed single-engined tractors capable of producing over , this competition put the Doe out of production after over 300 had been built. Legacy The Triple-D often makes appearances at agricultural fairs such as the Epworth Festival of the Plough in Epworth, Lincolnshire and LeSueur, Minnesota Pioneer Power Days show where it is always a crowd favourite, popular due to its unorthodox build. Triple-Ds are worth a great deal due to their relative rarity, even unrestored Does can demand extremely high prices at auction.

On 28 August 1895, Louise married Prosper Chéruit who supported her creative talents and contributed to some business aspects of her early career. Mme Chéruit notably helped launch the career of Paul Poiret, one of the early twentieth century’s most visionary designers, by buying a collection of twelve of his first designs in 1898.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, \\"Paul Poiret (1879-1944)\\" By 1900, labels sewn into clothes created at Raudnitz bore the words, Raudnitz & Cie, Huet & Chéruit Srs., 21, Place Vendôme, Paris – with the names of the sisters in more prominent type.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Wedding Dress, Raudnitz and Co. - Huet and Chéruit (1900), digital image of dress label By 1905, the firm's labels read, Huet & Chéruit, Anc.ne Mon.

As one of the leaders of French style, Chéruit and her house of couture took fashion from the Belle Époque through the Jazz Age. In 1910, one reporter wrote glowingly, \\"With taste, so original, so fine, and so personal, Madame Chéruit has placed her house of fashion at the first rank, not only in Paris, but in the entire world.\\"La Ville lumière : Anecdotes et documents historiques, ethnographiques, littéraires, artistiques, commerciaux et encyclopédiques, Paris: Paris Direction et Administration, 1909, p. 97 (translated from French) During her career, Chéruit refined for her aristocratic clientele the creative excesses of some of her contemporaries, offering soft, feminine, richly ornamented dresses which helped transition the couture industry from the glamour of high fashion to the reality of ready-to-wear. Garden party dresses designed by Chéruit, published in La Gazette du Bon Ton, 1914 In 1912, Mme. Chéruit signed a contract to collaborate with Lucien Vogel to produce the fashion magazine, La Gazette du Bon Ton. Six other top Paris designers – Georges Doeuillet, Jacques Doucet, Jeanne Paquin, Paul Poiret, Redfern, and the House of Worth – joined the project. Vogel hired leading Art Deco artists to fill the journal's pages with striking illustrations of the designers' fashions along with essays by noted writers.Mary E.

Chéruit had a special affection for the artistic style of Pierre Brissaud, and he created most of the illustrations of her work that appeared in the pages of La Gazette du Bon Ton. Mme Chéruit’s aesthetic was traditionally feminine, incorporating soft fabrics, pastel colors and rare embroideries, but she was innovative in line and cut. In late 1911 she introduced the pannier gown, full at the hips and tapering to an ankle-length hem, which recalled French court fashions of the 18th century.\\"In Paris it is Written, 'Elegance Oblige,'\\" Vogue, January 15, 1912, p. 21; \\"The Designers Open Their Doors,\\" Vogue, April 1, 1912, p. 108.

These striking creations drew the attention of silent film stars, such as Jeanne Eagels.Roaring Twenties, Classic Film Heroines, actress Jeanne Eagels With the move toward simpler fashions after the war, typified by such designers as Jean Patou and Coco Chanel. Mme. Cheruit's taste for opulence lost appeal and she retired in 1923. But for more than a decade, the house continued to produce beautiful, if no longer innovative, fashions including the flapper styles that defined the Jazz Age. In the mid to late 1920s, the brand was especially associated with the photographer Edward Steichen and his enticing images for Vogue of the Cheruit-dressed model Marion Morehouse. The design firm's continued popularity was reflected in iconic references in Evelyn Waugh's 1930 bestseller Vile Bodies.

The church experienced a fire on Easter Sunday morning, 24 March 2008. It was badly damaged but quickly repaired. In January 2012 the church's new website was launched.  History of the Parish Church  The Parish Church of St Peter and St Andrew was probably built on the site of the chapel attached to King Edward the Confessor’s hunting lodge, and it is possible that it was the king who added his favourite saint, Saint Peter, to an original dedication to St Andrew. Several synods or meetings of bishops took place here in the early days. After King John had been obliged to set his seal to Magna Carta in 1215, mercenary French soldiers came through Old Windsor and destroyed the church, which may have been mainly built of wood. The church was rebuilt in 1218 and had thick walls and small windows. During medieval times some of these windows were replaced with larger ones. In Georgian times, the church had a stone porch, in which weddings were sometimes celebrated, and on the tower was a small cupola. An avenue of larch trees, of which some stumps can still be seen, led to the north door. As wealthy families moved into the village, bringing their servants, there was not enough room in church and a gallery was built at the west end to accommodate the children. However, as they were badly behaved it was necessary to appoint a beadle to keep them in order. The church contained many large memorials. By 1865 restoration was needed and the architect Giles Gilbert Scott carried out an extensive plan, removing the porch, the gallery and the three-decker pulpit, and installing the rood screen, pews and choir vestry which we have today. The spire was built to replace the cupola. Three extra bells were added to the five dating from 1775, to make the ring up to eight bells. Subsequently, restoration campaigns have resulted in the replacement of much of the damaged stonework around the windows and on the tower. The spire has also been re-shingled several times. The church suffered a serious fire on Easter Day 2008 but has now been fully restored.

Draper was editor of the academic journal Philo from 2007 to 2012. His philosophical inquiry is focused on issues in the philosophy of religion; he has written extensively on the problem of evil, including the argument that the process of natural selection is sufficiently brutal so as to pose a problem for those who believe in an omnipotent and morally good creator. In 1997, he debated the Christian apologist William Lane Craig over the existence of God.The Existence of God: William Lane Craig vs Paul Draper U.S. Military Academy at West Point. September 30, 1997. He has edited a debate collection called God or Blind Nature? Philosophers Debate the Evidence, released as an e-book in 2007. One of Draper's influential and widely reprinted papers is \\"Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists\\", published in the journal Noûs in 1989. In it, Draper proposes a modification and extension of the \\"problem of evil\\" argument. Instead of claiming that the existence of evil logically contradicts theism, he argues that the \\"hypothesis of indifference\\", which holds that should supernatural beings exist, they are indifferent to our suffering, better explains the existence of suffering. Since the hypothesis of indifference is logically incompatible with theism, he considers this an evidentiary problem for theism. The paper relies significantly on the use of epistemic probabilities, equivalent to those used in Bayesian reasoning. He is also responsible for first coining the term skeptical theism.

The reserve is home to 400 bird species and 70 mammal species, including the American black bear (Ursus americanus), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), and cougar (Puma concolor).

It is located in the municipalities of Ocampo, Ciudad Acuña, and Múzquiz.Government of Coahuila Conservation efforts The Sierra del Carmen seen from Big Bend in Texas The isolation of the Sierra del Carmen and its relatively undisturbed environment has led to conservation efforts in Mexico and jointly with the United States. Much of the Sierra del Carmen has been declared by the government of Mexico the Maderas del Carmen Flora and Fauna Protected Area, a designation which allows many economic activities and private land holdings to continue to exist within the boundaries. The protected area comprises 520,000 acres (210,326 ha) The Maderas del Carmen is part of a bi-lateral conservation project called the El Carmen—Big Bend Conservation Corridor Initiative which includes contiguous land designated for conservation on both sides of the border totaling more than 3 million acres (1.2 million ha), an area almost as large as the U.S. state of Connecticut. In 2005, Maderas del Carmen became the first designated Wilderness area in Latin America.Robles Gil, Patricio \\"El Carmen: The First Wilderness Designation in Latin America\\" International Journal of Wilderness, Vol. 12, No. 2, August 2006, pp 36-40 The Maderas del Carmen Protected Area was created in 1994, although conservation efforts were initially slowed because the land was privately owned, either in large ranches or in the collective farms called ejidos. In 2000 a Mexican corporation, Cementos de Mexico (CEMEX) began to purchase lands for conservation in the region. On CEMEX lands livestock and fences were removed and native vegetation encouraged. By 2006, CEMEX owned 195,000 acres (78,947 ha) in or near the Maderas del Carmen and managed another 62,500 acres (25,303 ha).Gil, p.39 One of the important characteristics of the Sierra del Carmen is that it functions as a \\"corridor\\" enabling wildlife to migrate north and south. In the late 1980s the corridor between the Sierra and the mountains of west Texas enabled the black bear to disperse northward and reestablish itself in Big Bend National Park.

She was first played by Margaret Colin, and then by Hillary B. Smith for six years. However the actress most recognized for the role is Ellen Dolan, who played the character from 1989 until 2010, with a break from January 1993 to June 1994. Margo's storylines often focus on family dramas and police matters. The character is portrayed as a stoic, hard-nosed, determined and level-headed character, who in later years has begun interfering in the lives of her children. A pivotal storyline for the character came in 1992 when the character was raped by two criminals she was attempting to arrest during a holdup. The storyline was continually re-hashed by the show in the years after. Margo's only marriage in her 30-year history on the show was with that of lawyer Thomas \\"Tom\\" Hughes. The couple met during their investigation of Mr. Big and married in 1983. The super couple endured many trials and tribulations over their 27 years of marriage, most notably when Margo had an affair with Hal Munson, and Tom cheated on Margo with Emily Stewart. For her work on the show, Dolan won Soap Opera Digest's Outstanding Supporting Actress award in 1993, and was nominated for a Daytime Emmy the same year. Tom Hughes and Margo Montgomery are also the longest married couple in US soap opera history. Creation and casting =Background= The character of Margo Montgomery was brought in as the daughter of Lyla Montgomery and John Dixon. Marrying Tom Hughes three years after her arrival, the move connected her to the core Hughes family. Margo miscarried three children with Tom and gave birth to son Casey Hughes. In the 1980s, Margo gave birth to a son Adam Munson which turned out to be the son of policeman Hal Munson. =Casting= The character of Margo had been with the soap since 1980 and was played by several actresses: * Margaret Colin (1980–1983) * Hillary Bailey Smith (1983–1989) * Ellen Dolan (1989–1993; 1994-2010) * Glynnis O'Connor (1993–1994) Originating the role in 1980, The Edge of Night's Colin stayed for two years (eventually marrying her on-screen love interest Justin Deas). In 1983, Bailey took over the role and admitted Deas didn't agree with the idea of the character being recast. \\"Because he and Margaret (Colin), they were not yet together. This was his way of interacting with her at work, he didn’t like the idea that she wasn’t there anymore. I think I handled him the best and that’s why I got the job. Subsequently we became really good friends.\\" In 1989, after six years with the show, Bailey Smith quit the role, admitting she was burned out after her time on As the World Turns. \\"I wanted to spend more time with my kids. I felt I had taken Margo to the length I could take her. I needed to do something else. Doug’s feeling was, “Go take a break and come back.” I said, “I’d loved to do that, I just need a break.” Ellen Dolan was offered the role of Margo Montgomery Hughes in 1989 by then head-writer Douglas Marland. Dolan said four years of Guiding Light helped her prepare for the role. \\"I wanted her to be funny/quirky .... everything you don't get to see in her these days.\\" Dolan's first scene on the show, she revealed to CBS, was aboard an airplane. \\"My first storyline Casey, my husband’s Casey, had some rare disease and he was going to die. And I unplugged his life support but the way they brought the character of Margo back was they brought her home, so my first scenes were on an airplane,\\" Dolan recalled. Dolan said the writers never wrote the character funny and any humour there was she brought it to the show. \\"Anything that’s in there that brings a twinkle to anybody’s eye is what I bring to it. In fact, they have to take a lot of it away. They don’t let me do it a lot.\\" After several years of forecasting the cancellation of the 54-year- old show, Dolan's 20-year role came to an end when CBS ended the show, with the last episode airing in September 2010. When asked how she hoped her character would leave, she replied: \\"I don't hope anymore.\\" Storylines =Arrival in Oakdale= Upon arriving in Oakdale, Margo Montgomery immediately became involved with the married James Stenbeck. When Margo confided in her friend, Jeff Ward, that James loved her and would marry her, Jeff told her she was a fool. Meanwhile, Margo was beginning continually perplexed at her mother, Lyla's, antagonism toward Dr. John Dixon and his likewise cold demeanor toward Lyla. Not long after, Margo's life changed forever during Dee Stewart's rape trial. Lyla was a witness and seemed to be protecting the accused, John Dixon. District Attorney Tom Hughes's questioning of Lyla brought out the truth: John Dixon was Margo's real father. After being exonerated, John ended up being a victim of a hit and run. John was in the hospital for a few days and started running his own investigation despite the pleas of Lt. Savage not to. John pretended that he was blind and asked to stay with Margo at the house that she lived in on the Stenbeck estate. While John was supposedly recuperating but faking his blindness, he was dismayed to find out that Margo was carrying on an affair with James. John had started to suspect that James was involved somehow with John's nemesis, Dr. Rick Ryan. John was even more convinced of this when he saw Rick and James having secret meetings. When James set up Rick to date not only Margo but also his good friend, Hayley Wilson, James started to suspect that John was investigating him. Realizing that John wasn'tblind, James threatened to kill John with a knife. However, John recorded the whole meeting on a hidden audio tape. Soon, John discovered it was James who had attempted to kill him in the hit and run. Meanwhile, Tom, who was dating Margo's Aunt Maggie, tried to convince Margo that John was faking his blindness, but Margo didn't believe him. =Relationship with her father, John Dixon= Finally, one day in August 1981, John tried to play the blackmail tape for Margo, but the only thing on it was music from the rock group the Rolling Stones—Margo's sister, Cricket, had gotten her hands on the tape. John, however, had a duplicate tape in his safe deposit box. Margo got angry at him and told John that she was no longer his nursemaid, Later, Margo got miffed when John sought pity from his former wife Kim Andropolous and Margo's mother, Lyla. Tom had obviously made Margo suspicious of John's \\"blindness\\", but it wasn't enough, because although Margo ordered John out of her house, she quickly took him back. Later, learning that James was having *another* affair with a woman named Connie Wilson, Margo realized that her relationship with James was going nowhere and she ended it. It was her break-up with James that led Margo to a career in law enforcement, and she began working as an assistant for the law firm of Lowell, Colman, and Hughes for her Aunt Maggie. At the same time, Maggie and Tom started drifting away from each other. Meanwhile, one night, Margo accidentally got locked in at Fashions, Ltd. While investigating the place, that night James decided that there were too many people who suspected that he was smuggling drugs and jewels through Fashions so he decided to have it torched, while Margo was locked inside. Luckily, Margo was saved by Ernie Ross and her sister, Cricket, and all three put the fire out and saved Fashions. But as she waited for Ernie and Cricket to save her, Margo stumbled across the cache of illegal drugs and jewels. Despite her having found the evidence, Tom read Margo the riot act for almost having herself killed and he fired her. Undeterred, when Margo learned about a connection between Stenbeck and Mr. Big, Margo followed James to Paris to see what he was up to. To her surprise, Tom followed her. Soon, she spotted two thugs following James and Miranda Marlowe. =James Stenbeck= To investigate the connection between James and Mr. Big, she and Tom took off for the greenhouse. The meeting started on March 4, 1982, just as Margo and Tom arrived with the FBI hot on their trail. Mr. Big accused James of being a spy and Miranda of being a traitor. Miranda pulled a gun, but Mr. Big had already removed its firing pin. Seeing the danger they were in, Tom started a fire. In the confusion, Tom and Margo managed to escape, and so did Mr. Big. Tom and Margo spotted a plane in the field, and with Margo at the controls (although not knowing how to pilot a plane), they took off. Tom and Margo were horrified to learn that Mr. Big was hiding in the back, and before he jumped, he told them the tank was almost empty since he had siphoned off the gas of his plane. Margo somehow managed to land in a deserted area. For several days in the south of France, Tom and Margo seemed lost and neither of them knew French fluently enough to ask for directions. Finally, Margo spotted a castle in a clearing. Upon entering, they found a kitchen stocked with pancake mix and brandy but the phone was dead. A sudden gust of wind slammed the door, and an unseen hand turned the key in the lock. Exhausted, Tom and Margo went to sleep, awakening to a gourmet meal. Tom wanted to run, but their path was blocked by a 400-pound mute. This silent man, whose name was Bruno (who had killed Connie Wilson back in September 1981), ushered them to the table, and to their horror, Mr. Big joined them. This was Mr. Big's castle and he was about to show Tom and Margo how horrifying it was. Mr. Big proceeded to play games with his captives. Their only escape lay in figuring out clues from classic literature. If they failed, they would die. In the \\"room of love,\\" (from March 17–19, 1982) Margo stepped on a painted heart and was shot by an arrow (with only a minor injury to her arm. Tom found the clue in a Robert Browning sonnet, and they escaped. =Entry into the police force= Meanwhile, Tom and Margo realized they were in love, but once they met with Bob and then flew back to Oakdale they realized they had to keep their love for one another a secret since Tom was still seeing Margo's aunt Maggie. Maggie did figure it out, but since Margo did not want to hurt her aunt, she asked Tom to cool it between the two of them. Margo also decided to become a police officer. In May 1982, she passed the police academy entrance exams, but everyone worried for her safety. The officer in charge, Captain Aaron Striker, made it clear that Margo would have to prove herself. In July, she solved one of Striker's cases, and when he tried to take the credit, Margo called his bluff. Striker wanted her dismissed, but Margo caught him in the locker room with a shapely blond officer. Striker realized she'd make one hell of a policewoman and kept her on the force. Meanwhile, Tom finally convinced Margo of his love for her, and she agreed to see him. Later, Mr. Big arrived at Margo's cottage and searched thoroughly for a hat. Margo had no idea of the hat's importance and had given Tom the band from the hat, which Tom gave to his younger half-sister, Frannie. Later, Mr. Big came back to the cottage, knife in hand, and found the hat. John finally convinced Margo that Mr. Big was in town and that he had spotted him. Margo agreed to follow John to a clearing, but at first didn't see anything and doubted her father. Just as she was getting ready to leave, Margo spotted Mr. Big with a henchman. Margo told John to lay low and not confront Mr. Big while she went to get help. John didn't listen and confronted Mr. Big. Mr. Big held a gun on John and told him to stop following him or he'd be dead. Meanwhile, Margo was duped by another tape sent to her by one of Mr. Big's henchman into going to a nightclub on Halloween evening, 1982. At the nightclub, there was a magic show. Mr. Big informed the magician that Margo would make a wonderful assistant. She was handcuffed and blindfolded and put in a box. =Kidnapped by Mr. Big= When the box was opened, Margo was gone, as was a cougar. In an isolated room away from the nightclub, Mr. Big told Margo that if she didn't tell him where the hatband was, he would release the cougar. Luckily, Tom saved Margo in the nick of time, and she told Tom about the hatband, which Frannie had left at Fashions. Miranda told Margo that Mr. Big had said something about his fortune being locked up under his hat. They found a miniature audiotape sewed into the hatband, which computer genius Ernie Ross offered to decode. The only two words they could make out were \\"Bilan\\" and \\"Corsica.\\" Miranda was shocked: Bilan was her daughter by Jacques. She was 17, and Miranda hadn't seen her in some time. After Mr. Big had killed Jacques, he had kidnapped Bilan, from a convent near Nice, France, and spirited her to his ranch in the east African island nation of Zanzibar. Mr. Big had nearly convinced Bilan that he was her biological father, which was untrue. Mr. Big was shocked to learn that Bilan knew the secrets to the fortune that he felt Jacques had kept for himself and quickly booked an airline flight to Zanzibar. Miranda feared for the daughter. Tom and Margo went to the convent in France, where Bilan was last seen. They figured out that Mr. Big had spirited Bilan to his ranch in Zanzibar. Big beat them to Zanzibar, though, and released Bilan into the care of a village of Bububu (Kiswahili's) tribe. By this time, Bilan had fallen quite ill and the priest in a nearby village church told Mr. Big where to find Bilan. Tom and Margo weren't having as much luck, but were hot on Mr. Big's trail. However, before they arrived near the village, they had to go on adventure on the Rufiji River and nearly drowned during a storm. On a nearby bank, while drying out from the storm, one evening Margo went skinny-dipping. Tom awoke and saw her, and they made love for the first time. =Mr. Big's death= Tom and Margo met some Bububu people who were willing to tell them where Bilan was. However, Mr. Big met them and decided to kill them once and for all. Mr. Big arranged for Tom and Margo to be released into a pit of poisonous snakes that nearly killed them. But when Mr. Big left to go retrieve Bilan, Margo was able to convince the chief of the village to let Tom and Margo go. Margo had no idea that she had promised the chief to be his perfect seventh wife, in an exchange for their freedom. When the chief took Margo (his seventh wife) and Tom back to the village, Margo and Tom discovered a very ill Bilan. Margo nursed Bilan until her fever broke, but then Mr. Big kidnapped the girl, with Tom and Margo in pursuit. In a clearing tent, Mr. Big tried to get Bilan to decode the message, but Bilan was still delirious from the fever and couldn't concentrate. When Tom and Margo caught up with them, Mr. Big set fire to the tent, without Tom, Margo and Bilan realizing and there were explosives in the tent. Tom, Margo and Bilan were okay, but then Big went missing. He was presumed dead, although Margo had her doubts that Tom tried his best to relieve. Sure enough Margo was proven correct. During the village chief's wedding ceremony to a clueless Margo, Mr. Big turned up alive. He again kidnapped Bilan to get her to decode her father's message. Meanwhile, Tom and Margo swam to Big's boat. They grabbed Bilan and tried to escape, but were caught. Margo begged Mr. Big to spare Bilan. Suddenly, Bilan grabbed a hold of Mr. Big and struggled with him and threw him overboard where Mr. Big met his untimely death, when he was eaten by one of the crocodiles. =Marriage to Tom Hughes= After Tom and Margo returned to Oakdale, on January 24, 1983, they were thrown a grand surprise party by Maggie and Lyla. Tom and Margo had intended to tell Maggie about their true feelings, but when they walked into the door, Margo collapsed. Margo was taken to Memorial Hospital and it discovered that she had been bitten by a mosquito. She recovered rather quickly, but was astounded to learn that Tom had defended the woman who had supposedly killed her father John, Dee Stewart. Margo broke up with Tom and discovered that she was pregnant. Sadly, Margo miscarried the baby. Tom misinterpreted the situation and mistakenly believed that she'd had an abortion. Later Margo would take Tom back, when she learned that John was still alive. Finally, in the summer of 1983, Margo and Tom married in an impromptu ceremony in the park. =Affair with Hal and her pregnancy= Margo's first crisis came when Barbara Ryan decided that she wanted Tom back. She set it up so that he would believe they slept together. When Tom told Margo about the \\"affair\\", she planned to divorce him. Luckily, she found out that there was no affair. She and Tom reconciled and she became pregnant. However, Margo miscarried the baby. Still despondent over the miscarriage, she was crushed when Tom went to Washington DC to work on the crime commission. During Tom's absence, Margo confided in her best friend, Hal Munson. Believing her marriage was over, they began an affair. Soon after Tom returned, he and Margo decided to put their marriage back together. When Margo learned that she was pregnant (with Hal's baby) she fled the country. Tom found her in Greece and ended up delivering her son, Adam. Tom agreed to raise Adam as his own. =Birth of Casey= A few years later, Margo became pregnant with Tom's child. At the same time, Margo's stepfather, Casey Peretti, was terminally ill and made her promise to unplug the machines that he was hooked up to. Margo fulfilled her promise, but charges were brought up against her. The charges were dropped. Margo then gave birth to a son, Casey. =Rape and Nevins break- in= A few years later, Margo's idyllic life would come crashing down in an instant. The night Tom, the boys, and she returned home from vacation to Cape Cod, Margo went out to pick up a bottle of Tom's favorite wine. However, she stepped right in the middle of a hold-up. Margo chased the perpetrators into a dark alley in an effort to get their license plate number. Suddenly, the men grabbed her and pulled her into a car where one of the robbers viciously raped her. Afterward, instead of dealing with her trauma, Margo put all her energies into catching the men—Fickett and the man who raped her, Elroy Nevins. When both men were apprehended, the Hughes family was horrified to learn that Nevins was HIV positive. That meant that Margo could be too. Although her initial test came back negative, Margo had to wait six months for final word on her prognosis. Meanwhile, Nevins pleaded guilty to the rape but when Tom and Margo discovered that an unremorseful Nevins knew he was HIV positive, they pressed charges and tried him for attempted murder which led to a stiffer sentence. As the months went by, Tom lovingly supported Margo as she dealt with her rape. Finally, after six months the Hughes family was relieved to learn that Margo was HIV negative. The following year, Nevins escaped from prison and broke into the Hughes house to seek revenge. Tom confronted him using Margo's gun and shot him when Nevins reached for his own gun. =Return to Oakdale= In the meantime, the Hughes took in Dawn Wheeler—another of Nevins's victims—who was HIV positive. Dawn developed a harmless crush on Tom. However, Margo didn't find it so harmless and accepted Jason Benedict's offer to come to work with the F.B.I. on special investigation into the Grimaldi family. After spending a few months in Washington DC, Margo started getting homesick and returned to Oakdale to be with Tom and the boys. =Plane crash= A few years later, Margo was involved in a plane crash. Following the crash, she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and had to be institutionalized. When she returned, her relationship with Tom and her sons was somewhat strained. =Tom and Emily Stewart= Shortly after, Margo accidentally killed Eddie Silva's mother during a drug bust. Margo felt extremely guilty and asked Eddie to stay with her family. Tom (who was having his own problems) was adamantly against this. Eddie's presence helped put a strain on their marriage. Eddie had a crush on Margo and told her so. However, unbeknownst to both, this conversation was filmed and broadcast by Emily Stewart for Tom to see in the hope that it would break up Margo and Tom. In the fall of 1998, Margo became pregnant with Tom's child. Hesitant at first, she decided that having a baby might be good for them. However, Margo miscarried. The same night Margo lost her baby, Tom was having a one-night stand with Emily. When Margo found out about the affair, she threw Tom out. She relented though and took him back, only to learn that Emily was pregnant. Unable to deal with the fact that Emily was now a permanent part of their lives, Margo served Tom with separation papers. About this time, she met the mysterious Alec Wallace and became friends with him. =Renewing of her wedding vows= Soon, Margo found herself drawn to this complicated and brooding man. Alec intrigued Margo and when he came under investigation by the police, Margo agreed to go undercover even though she was certain that he was innocent of any wrongdoing. When evidence came forth that Alec might have been involved in several deaths, Margo was sure he was innocent and was determined to prove that everyone was wrong about Alec. Margo realized too late that she was wrong. When Margo found Alec in Tom's hospital room after he was attacked, she immediately knew that she made a mistake and was determined to send him to jail. Alec was on to her though, and drugged her. The next morning, Margo woke up with Alec dead and she had no memory of what happened. Subsequently, Margo was tried and convicted of his murder. Margo remembered who killed Alec and the conviction was overturned. Margo's greatest supporter during this crisis was Tom, who never believed that she killed Alec even when she had doubts. After a harrowing year, Tom and Margo renewed their wedding vows. =Years after= Since renewing her vows, Margo spent her time dealing with her siblings' various schemes and crises. She cut all ties with Katie after learning that Katie had lied about (among other things) Chris Hughes stalking her. Margo also had many an argument with Hal over his treatment of Craig. After Hal was forced to resign as chief of detectives after decking Craig, Margo inherited the position. Aside from scorn from other officers for \\"stealing\\" Hal's job, she had to agonize over her actions after arresting her brother for the boathouse explosion, which nearly killed Barbara. =Katie's donation= Margo's rape of years ago came back to haunt her when she learned that she had hepatitis C. Deathly ill, Margo's liver failed and she required a transplant. Katie was able to donate part of her liver and Margo recovered. Instead of taking a break from police work, Margo threw herself into her job and became involved in several criminal investigations. =Margo's affair= In 2004, the Hughes marriage would reach another crisis with the arrival of former football star and new sports anchor for WOAK, Doc Reese. From the moment she laid eyes on him, Margo, inexplicably, found herself drawn to this man who oozed sex appeal. It soon became apparent that Doc was attracted to Margo as well and he wasted no time flirting with her, flirting that she participated in. Although her best friend, Jessica Griffin Harris, tried to warn Margo that she was playing with fire, Margo enjoyed the attention and saw nothing wrong with it. However, as the weeks went by, Margo became more and more attracted to Reese who pursued her with a passion, making her feel desirable. Soon Margo's self-control started to crumble, especially after she found herself caught in a smoldering kiss with Doc in the club's sauna. After stopping things from going too far (only because an employee at the club, Jill, walked in and interrupted), Margo couldn't stop thinking of Doc and began to consider that it might be best to sleep with him, thereby getting him out of her system. However, the night she was going to go through with it, Doc unexpectedly refused her and asked her to leave his hotel room. Doc's rejection worked like a cold shower for Margo and the next morning she confided to Jessica that she was over him. Margo's lies and distracted behavior came back to haunt her when Tom, learning she'd lied to him about working late the previous night, saw a pattern to her behavior and accused her of having an affair with Reese. Although Margo tried to tell Tom that nothing happened between her and Reese, he didn't believe her and was convinced she was holding something back. Trying to satisfy him, she admitted to the flirting but made it seem much more innocent than it actually was. Again, Tom didn't believe her. Soon, Margo found herself being blackmailed by Jill, who asked for a night with Doc in exchange for her silence. Although Margo pleaded with Doc to comply, he saw Jill as a troublemaker and refused to go through with it. True to her word, Jill went to Tom and told him about seeing Margo and Doc come out of the sauna together. Found out, Margo told Tom about the smoldering kisses she and Doc shared but insisted that nothing sexual occurred. Although he believed her, it was too late. Disgusted with the way she'd lied to him, Tom filed for a legal separation. At the same time, Margo learned that Doc did have an affair—with Jessica. That knowledge put a crimp in her friendship with Jessica. However, by year's end, Margo healed her relationship with not only Jess, but Tom as well. =Dealing with Casey= Meanwhile, Casey was growing into quite the teenager. Unlike Adam, who was always very responsible, Casey was somewhat of a slacker. During his senior year in high school, Casey was named the father of Gwen Norbeck's baby. However, Casey denied it vehemently and, although Tom had doubts, Margo believed him. Months later, after Gwen learned that her baby had died, Casey finally owned up to his parents and admitted that Gwen had been pregnant with his child. Margo was saddened not only at losing the grandchild that she never knew she had but also at Casey's failure to own up to his responsibility. Because of his history, Margo was wary when Casey grew closer to young Maddie Coleman who ultimately became a good influence on him. In the meantime, Oakdale was saddened when Hal was killed in the line of duty. With her dear friend gone, Margo was promoted to chief of police. At the same time, Casey's irresponsibility got him into trouble again—this time from gambling online. Casey racked up a huge debt and resorted to stealing from Lisa in order to pay it. However, when Casey revealed the truth to Adam, Adam convinced him to set Will Munson up for the crime. Now a music producer, Adam, unbeknownst to everyone, was obsessed with Will's wife Gwen. Finally, Casey went to his parents and confessed what he had done. Meanwhile, Adam was nowhere to be found. Several weeks later, Margo would learn that Adam was on the lam after trying to rape Gwen. Still shocked by the actions of her older son, Margo was even more saddened when Casey was sent to jail. Though her family tried to assure her that she had been a good mother, Margo frequently had doubts. =Casey's release from prison= Eight months later, Casey was finally released. Though Tom warned her to give Casey some time to adjust, Margo immediately began peppering him with questions about his future. Soon after his arrival, Margo returned home and thought she heard Adam's voice. However, it wasn't Adam—it was Casey's friend, Matt O’Connor. Matt, who appeared to be a good kid, informed Margo that he met Casey at Oakdale University. Instantly taking a liking to Matt, Margo invited him into her home. As the weeks went by, Matt seemed to be a good influence on Casey—especially since Casey agreed to take some courses at Oakdale U. Then one day, Margo was shocked to find a note “I’ll be there when you least expect it.” That same night, Margo apparently got a call from Adam asking her to meet him at the church at Luther's Corner. When Margo and Tom went, it wasn't Adam they found—it was Matt who'd been shot. Matt told Margo that the man who shot him was Gray Girard, his employer. Meanwhile, Alison Stewart had seen Matt in conversation with Gray various times. Suspecting that Gray was bad news, Alison took her suspicions to Casey and the two found out something startling—Gray's real name was Gerald Nevins. Casey called Margo with the news and Margo realized that it could not be a coincidence. Gray must be related to her rapist. =Shooting of Gray= Meanwhile, Matt quickly recovered and confessed that Gray hired him to infiltrate the Hughes home. He also admitted that the Hughes had been good to him and felt remorse. Since Gray was wanted for racketeering by the FBI, Matt was supposed to be taken into custody for questioning. Instead he was kidnapped by Gray and brought to the Hughes house while Casey and Alison were there. Gray held the group hostage and forced Casey to call his mother by threatening to kill Alison. When Margo arrived, Gray held her hostage as well and revealed that he was Roy Nevins's brother. A cold Gray blamed Margo for his brother's death and told Margo that he'd waited years to get his revenge. Gray then He then set a bomb and walked out. Luckily, the bomb was defective and failed to go off. That same night, Gray snuck into the Hughes home to finish what he started. Ali returned to get her cell phone and while talking with Margo spotted Gray with a gun. Alison shoved Margo out of the way. When Tom ran down to stop Gray, he was overpowered and Margo shot Gray to keep him from killing Tom. Though Margo assured Tom and everyone that she was alright, the incident rattled Margo to the core. =Rivalry with Emily Stewart= Meanwhile, Casey continued to flounder without direction, which irked Margo, who kept badgering him into getting a job or going back to school. Soon, Casey found the perfect opportunity when he visited the Intruder offices and learned that Emily had fired her assistant. Casey charmed Emily into hiring him, despite Emily's concern that Margo would not approve since Margo hated Emily. Emily was right—Margo did not approve and demanded that Casey quit. To keep the peace, Emily fired Casey. Casey refused to accept that and stood up to Margo. After telling Margo in no uncertain terms that she had no right butting in, Casey asked Emily for his job back. In the meantime, when Casey helped Emily investigate some stolen manuscripts from the university, he was framed. Margo refused to believe Casey's claims of innocence. Casey was quickly vindicated and although he refused to forgive Margo for doubting him, Emily convinced him to forgive her. Emily also convinced Casey to come clean when he told her about the money he stole from the Lakeview for Matt. Casey confessed the theft to Lisa who had no choice but to tell his parents. After railing at Casey for the theft, Margo told Casey that she would keep silent if he returned to school. Although a stubborn Casey refused, the alternative was returning to prison for violating his parole so Casey had no choice but to comply. Casey's friendship with Emily unnerved Margo and she finally resorted to blackmail to get Emily to stay away. Margo warned Emily that if she didn't back off Casey, she would tell Tom about Emily's recent past as a prostitute. Later, during the week of her twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, Margo got a shock when she returned home unexpectedly to find Emily in a state of undress with Casey. A cold Margo immediately pulled a gun on Emily and threatened to shoot her. Tom came home and was able to defuse the situation. Appalled at the thought of Emily cavorting with Casey, Margo vindictively revealed Emily's hooker past to Tom and Casey. However, Casey knew all about it and didn't care. Not only that, but Casey defied his parents by moving out in order to remain with Emily. Rattled by the revelation of Emily's hooker past, Tom sought for full custody of Daniel. However, when Casey blasted his father for his actions, Tom ultimately backed down. =Acceptance of Casey and Emily's relationship= When it became clear that Casey would pick Emily over his family, Tom convinced a begrudging Margo that they had to accept the relationship or they risked losing their son. Soon after, Margo was horrified to learn from Casey that he and Emily had impulsively gotten married and Emily quickly denounced it as a mistake. Later, Emily collapsed and was rushed to the hospital after a confrontation with Margo. Casey became ill as well and Margo deduced that the pair had been poisoned by Rick Decker—Emily intentionally and Casey indirectly. Seeing Emily's concern for Casey, Margo took her to Casey's room. Chris found an antidote to the poison and Emily and Casey made a full recovery. Having seen their devotion to each other, Tom and Margo finally accepted the relationship. However, Emily still felt uneasy about marrying Casey under the influence of Decker's drug and convinced him to get their marriage annulled. =Adam's death= Later, the Hughes family received word that Adam had been killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. At the same time, Riley, a mysterious young man claiming to be Adam's friend, insinuated himself into their lives. Though Margo instantly welcomed Riley into their home, Casey was suspicious. Later, after Margo was shot in the line of duty, Riley rushed to her side and called her \\"mom\\"—revealing that he was Adam. Margo confided in Casey who confronted his brother. According to Adam, he'd been in a bombing in Afghanistan and had to have facial grafts that had changed his appearance. Adam had used the opportunity to return to Oakdale to seek forgiveness from his family. Casey was angry that Adam had lied to his family yet again, but for Margo's sake, agreed not to tell Tom. At this point, Tom became suspicious of Margo's interest in Riley and suspected that something was going on. Though Casey continually harped on Adam to tell the truth, Adam was unwilling to reveal himself. However, when Tom tried to get Riley to leave town, Margo finally confessed that Riley was Adam. After a furious Tom confronted his son, Adam turned himself in to the police. Thanks to testimony from Maddie, stating that her having buried him alive may have led to his violent behavior, and a plea of leniency from Tom, the case against Adam was dismissed. However, Adam disappointed his family again by skipping town without saying goodbye. =Swapping houses and final episode of As The World Turns= Afterwards, Margo concentrated on her professional life. On the personal front, things were finally looking bright for Casey when he announced that he was enrolling in law school and he was engaged to Alison Stewart. Though happy for Casey, Margo was devastated when he and Alison opted to move to Carbondale to attend school. Not knowing how to live in her home with her children gone, Margo and Katie decided to switch houses—Katie would move into Margo's and Margo and Tom would make new memories in the house Katie previously shared with Brad.

The bridge was moved to its current location in Billie Creek Village in December 1979. Construction The Beeson Covered Bridge is a single span Burr Arch covered bridge structure that was built by the Frankfort Construction Company in 1906. The bridge is long, wide, with a clearance of . The bridge had concrete foundations when it was built and was placed on concrete foundations when it was moved, but after a flood in 1989, the bridge was reset on creosoted wood. History Many of the bridges in Parke County are named after a nearby city or the body of water they cross but due to another bridge across the county being named the Marshall Covered Bridge it was named after the nearby Beeson family. William H. Beeson, who was born in 1879, owned 53 acres of land near the bridge. It crossed Roaring Creek on C.R. 216, which is now C.R. 200N. Using the map that Parke County sent when filing for NRHP status, the bridge was originally located at: . Note: This includes , Site map, and Accompanying photographs. The bridge was closed in 1969, because the abutments were declared unsafe. In March 1979, a nearby concrete bridge collapsed. This, along with the earlier closing of the Beeson Covered Bridge, caused a severe problem with access to Marshall, and nearby Turkey Run High School and Turkey Run State Park. The Roaring Creek Citizens Association (RCCA) was formed to address this problem. At 11:47 pm on August 9, 1979, just shortly after the RCCA had a meeting at Turkey Run High School, a fire was reported at the Beeson Bridge. Firefighters from Marshall, fought from the south end while firefighters from Bloomingdale, fought from the north end of the bridge. The fire was found to be a clear case of arson, fuel oil odors were still strong the following morning. The Parke County Sheriff's Department, Indiana State Police Department and the Indiana State Fire Marshal all were part of the investigation, owing that it is a registered national landmark the FBI probably had jurisdiction too but declined to join. Due to the fire happening so close to the RCCA meeting the RCCA threatened legal action with anyone accusing them of being connected with the fire. Less than a week later another fire was started just after midnight on August 15, 1979. A nearby neighbor saw someone at the bridge and heard a car turn around in his driveway. Shortly after that he saw flames at the bridge and contacted the Fire Department. The Marshall Fire Department found the bridge floor covered in flames but was quickly able to extinguish them. On December 4, 1979, the Buchta Trucking Company began moving the bridge to its current location over Williams Creek, in Billie Creek Village, Rockville. They first removed the roof and sides before transporting the rest of the bridge.

Founded in 1919 at the University of Wisconsin, NASPA is one of many organizations focused on graduate enrollment management.  History  NASPA headquarters in Washington, D.C. In December 1918, Robert Rienow, the dean of men at the University of Iowa desired to create a meeting that would bring together various deans of men in the midwest. He, with Thomas Arkle Clark, dean of men at the University of Illinois, facilitated the founding meeting held at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in January 1919. The first meeting was quite small - three deans of men and three professors having campus interests were in attendance. Professor Louis A. Strauss of the University of Michigan referred to the first meeting as the \\"Conference of Deans and Advisers of Men.\\" This label was used in prevalence until 1929 when it was changed to the National Association of Deans and Advisers of Men (NADAM). The new name was more fitting because many American universities did not have the \\"Dean of Men\\" title. Thomas Arkle Clark was the first person to claim the title in 1909, although he assumed the responsibilities in 1901. Scott Goodnight, dean of men at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, served as host for this historic first meeting. Retroactively, he is referred to as the first president of NADAM. In 1925, the first piece of \\"research\\" - presented by John Bennett of Teachers College, Columbia University - was offered at a NADAM meeting. It dealt with the prevalence of the office of dean of men in American colleges and universities. The last meeting of the '20s was the first to be conducted away from the college campus; there were 76 participants, each paying dues of $10. In the 1930s, there were continued requests for publications to be submitted to the conferences. The NASPA Journal, as a result, was first introduced in 1963. Before that time, newsletters were the primary way of communicating regarding published material. One of the Association's major preoccupations in the 1940s was World War II and its aftermath. The adaptation of campuses to the war effort are reflected in the conference minutes, and the problems relating to veterans once the war was over took the rest of the decade. The decade was noted by the presence of Armour Blackburn of Howard University, the first African-American administrator to participate and serve on an executive committee. As student affairs offices began to change and administrators no longer used \\"Dean of Men\\" and \\"Advisor of Men\\" as their titles, the organization followed suit. Mary Ethel Ball, acting dean of students at the University of Colorado, became the first female \\"institutional representative,\\" although women had participated in meetings since the 20s. Dean Wesley P. Lloyd at Brigham Young University recommended a name change in 1951 to the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators (NASPA). This gave a new breadth to the organization, which stated its purpose: \\"to discuss and study the most effective methods of aiding students in their intellectual, social, moral, and personal development\\". Five commissions were established at the 1951 conference to deal with substantive, ongoing issues (e.g., professional relationships, ethics, professional preparation). A secondary benefit of the commissions was in making more members able to participate in the association's activities. The 1960s marked many changes in NASPA. For the first time, outside funding was secured for a NASPA activity, making the association an early leader in educating members concerning drug abuse. NASPA was an active participant in the development of the Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of Students. From 1966 until the end of the decade and beyond, crisis was the most prominent campus issue and the most prominent association concern. Some deans were enormously successful in protecting both their campuses and the rights of students, but disruption of campuses became more prevalent. During the 1970s, increased regionalization heightened opportunities for involvement across the whole spectrum of NASPA's membership. Alice Manicur of Frostbug State College became the first female president, and community colleges began to make their presence felt. George Young at Broward Community College was the first community college person to serve as president of NASPA. It was during this decade that NASPA first established a national office under the leadership of Channing Briggs at Portland State University. Upon Briggs' retirement in 1981, Richard F. Stevens became the second executive director, and the national office was moved to Ohio State University. In 1985, the association voted to move its headquarters to Washington, D.C., and in 1987 Elizabeth M. Nuss of Indiana University, succeeded Stevens. In 1995, Gwendolyn Dungy succeeded Nuss. In 2000 the National Association for Women in Education was merged into NASPA. Laurence Smith, Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management at Eastern Michigan University, initiated the concept of the Centers for Innovation in February 2000, proposing centers for leadership, public policy, research, and technology to guide professional development for the association.

He led a daring escape from the Confederate-encircled Union garrison at Harpers Ferry. Biography Born in Alabama, Davis was the eldest of six sons born to Benjamin E. and Matilda Holladay Davis between 1831 and 1843. Matilda Davis died in 1843. Benjamin E. Davis died in June 1846. Benjamin Davis and his five younger brothers became wards of an uncle William Taylor who lived in Monroe County, Mississippi. Davis was appointed from Mississippi to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1854. Among his classmates were Jeb Stuart, Stephen H. Weed, Oliver Otis Howard and William Dorsey Pender. Davis was originally assigned to the 5th U. S. Infantry but transferred to the 1st. U. S. Dragoons March 3, 1855. Wounded while fighting the Apache in frontier New Mexico, Davis served with the dragoons in New Mexico and California. He was a captain with the 1st Dragoons when he was appointed Lt. Colonel of the 1st California Volunteer Cavalry Battalion on August 19, 1861. He commanded this battalion until he resigned on November 1, 1861 to return east with the 1st U.S. Cavalry. At the outbreak of war Davis decided to stay with the Union, and was promoted to captain, 1st U.S. Cavalry Regiment, July 30, 1861. Davis had three brothers who served in the Confederate States Army two with the 11th Mississippi Infantry; and a third in the 2nd Mississippi. Neither brother who served with the 11th Mississippi survived the war. The brother who served with the 2nd Mississippi survived the war but took his own life several years after hostilities ceased. Commissioned colonel of the 8th New York Volunteer Cavalry on June 25, 1862, Davis was leading that unit on September 14, stationed with the defending force at Harpers Ferry, after the town had been invested by troops under Stonewall Jackson. Finding his commanding officer Col. Dixon S. Miles unable to protect the force from bombardment and ready to surrender his troops, Davis and fellow officer Lt. Col. Hasbrouck Davis with his 12th Illinois Cavalry determined to fight their way out northward out of the encirclement. Crossing the Potomac River on a pontoon bridge under cover of night, 1,300 Union cavalrymen quietly escaped, overwhelming or avoiding Confederate pickets assigned to cover the winding road north. While moving in pitch black darkness, Davis came across an artillery wagon train belonging to Confederate Maj. Gen. James Longstreet, and using his deep Mississippi- accented voice, ordered their unsuspecting commander to change direction and accept his unit as cavalry escort. As sunlight broke, the wagon drivers were startled to discover drawn pistols from their blue-clad escort, and as a result Davis's command not only escaped to Union lines at Greencastle, Pennsylvania, by morning September 15, but also captured Longstreet's forty- wagon reserve ordnance train with no losses. Davis was promoted to major, U.S. Army, for his exploit. Davis led the 1st Brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's cavalry division through the ineffectual \\"Stoneman Raid\\" in the Chancellorsville Campaign. In the Gettysburg Campaign, Davis led the brigade in the Battle of Brandy Station. In the early hours of June 9, 1863, Davis's men charged a South Carolina artillery battery near Beverly's Ford and were met by a strong cavalry counterattack, which sent most of the brigade reeling. Davis himself refused to fall back and challenged all comers to combat. He twirled his saber with one hand, firing his Colt revolver with the other until he ran out of ammunition. Confederate Lt. O. R. Allen of Major Caball E. Flournoy's regiment charged at Davis, hugging his horse's neck to evade Davis's saber slashing, then fired his pistol three times at point-blank range. The third shot struck Davis in the forehead, killing him instantly. Davis was a man of rough manners and a stern disciplinarian. One of his troopers described him as \\"a proud tyrannical devil\\" as likely to be killed by his own soldiers as by the Confederates. The Provost Marshal General of the Army of the Potomac, Marsena R. Patrick, described him as \\"our best cavalry officer\\". He was buried in the West Point cemetery.

It was one of a set of at least six canons probably written in Vienna in 1782.Cliff Eisen, Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians online, Sung by six voices as a three-part round, it is thought to be a party piece for his friends. The main theme is derived from the final movement of Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 3 in G-Major. English translation The German idiom used as the title of the work is equivalent to the English \\"Kiss my arse!\\" or American \\"Kiss my ass!\\" However, the literal translation of the title is \\"Lick me in the arse\\". Publication and modern discovery Mozart died in 1791 and his widow, Constanze Mozart, sent the manuscripts of the canons to publishers Breitkopf & Härtel in 1799 saying that they would need to be adapted for publication. The publisher changed the title and lyrics of this canon to the more acceptable \\"\\" (\\"Let us be glad!\\"). Of Mozart's original text, only the first words were documented in the catalogue of his works produced by Breitkopf & Härtel.Preface to the Neue Mozart Ausgabe Vol. III/10, p. X. A new text version, which may have been the authentic one, came to light in 1991. Handwritten texts to this and several other similar canons were found added to a printed score of the work in an historical printed edition acquired by Harvard University's Music Library. They had evidently been added to the book by a later hand. However, since in six of the pieces these entries matched texts that had, in the meantime, independently come to light in original manuscripts, it was hypothesised that the remaining three may, too, have been original, including texts for K. 231 (\\"Leck mich im Arsch\\" itself), and another Mozart work, \\"Leck mir den Arsch fein recht schön sauber\\" (\\"Lick my arse nice and clean\\", K. 233; K. 382d in the revised numbering). Later research revealed that the latter work was likely composed by Wenzel Trnka. Lyrics The text rediscovered in 1991 consists only of the repeated phrases:Denis Pajot: \\"K. 233 and K. 234 Mozart's 'Kiss my Ass' Canons.\\" Mozart Forum where \\"A...\\" obviously stands for \\"Arsch\\"; \\"g'schwindi\\" is a dialect word derived from \\"geschwind\\", meaning \\"quickly\\". The bowdlerised text of the early printed editions reads: {  Let us be glad! Grumbling is in vain! Growling, droning is in vain, is the true bane of life, Droning is in vain, Growling, droning is in vain, in vain! Thus let us be cheerful and merry, be glad! } Another semi-bowdlerized adaptation is found in the recordings of The Complete Mozart edition by Brilliant Classics: {  Kiss my arse! Goethe, Goethe! Götz von Berlichingen! Second act; You know the scene too well! Let us now shout the summary: Mozart here gets literary! } This is a clear allusion to the line \\"\\" (literally, \\"he can lick me in the ass\\" or idiomatically \\"he can kiss my ass\\") attributed to the late medieval German knight Götz von Berlichingen, known best as the title hero of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's drama.

An Essay on Economic Interpretation is a book of literary criticism from a Socialist point of view of the traditional \\"great authors\\" of Western and American literature (along with a few painters and composers). Mammonart was written by the prolific muckraking journalist, novelist and Socialist activist Upton Sinclair, and published in 1925. Overview The book is one of the \\"Dead Hand\\" series: six books Sinclair wrote on American institutions. The series also includes The Profits of Religion, The Brass Check (journalism), The Goose-step (higher education), The Goslings (elementary and high school education), and Money Writes! (literature). The term \\"Dead Hand\\" criticizes Adam Smith's concept that allowing an \\"invisible hand\\" of many people's individual self-interests to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole. Sinclair intended Mammonart to be an alternative \\"textbook of culture\\" (p. 384). He says he expected it to soon be used as a textbook in Russian high schools, and hoped that it would be adopted by other European countries after they experienced Socialist revolutions. In each chapter, Sinclair critiques an artist according to his or her support for the rich and powerful. Most artists do not challenge the status quo and take positions such as 'art for art's sake' or 'art is entertainment.' No matter how beautiful their work, by their passivity such artists perpetuate oppression and inequality. For example, in the chapter on Shakespeare, entitled \\"Phosphorence and Decay,\\" Sinclair praises the writer's glorious facility with words; however, this great talent \\"saved him from thinking.\\" In contrast, Dickens' unique contribution was to \\"force into aristocratic and exclusive realms of art the revolutionary notion that the poor and degraded are equally as interesting as the rich and respectable.\\" Mammonart is notable for Sinclair's repeated statement that all art, including his own, is propaganda. The popular distinction between propagandists like Jesus and Tolstoi, and Shakespeare and Goethe, who are \\"pure and unsullied creative artists ... is purely a class distinction and a class weapon...\\" (p. 106) The list of artists discussed is similar, though shorter, to a 1940 list of Great Books. Sinclair also includes writers of lesser importance who were included at the time in the American literary canon.

With the growth of technology for storing and sharing maps, collaborative maps have become competitors to commercial services, in the case of OpenStreetMap, or components of them, as in Google Map Maker and Yandex.Map editor. Volunteers collect geographic information and the citizens/individuals can be regarded as sensors within a geographical environment that create, assemble, and disseminate geographic data provided voluntarily by the individuals. Collaborative mapping is a special case of the larger phenomenon known as crowd sourcing, that allows citizens to be part of collaborative approach to accomplish a goal. The goals in collaborative mapping have a geographical aspect, e.g. having a more active role in urban planning. Especially when data, information, knowledge is distributed in a population and an aggregation of data is not available, then collaborative mapping can bring a benefit for the citizens or activities in a community with an e-Planing Platform. Extensions of critical and participatory approaches to geographic information systems combines software tools with a joint activities to accomplish a community goal. Additionally, the aggregated data can be used for a Location-based service like available public transport options at the geolocation where a mobile device is currently used (GPS-sensor). The relevance for the user at a specific geolocation cannot be represented with logic value in general (relevant=true/false). The relevance can be represented with Fuzzy-Logic or a Fuzzy architectural spatial analysis.Ricker, B., Daniel, S. and Hedley, N. (2014) ‘Fuzzy Boundaries: Hybridizing Location-based Services, Volunteered Geographic Information and Geovisualization Literature’, Geography Compass, 8(7). doi: 10.1111/gec3.12138 Types Collaborative mapping applications vary depending on which feature the collaborative edition takes place: on the map itself (shared surface), or on overlays to the map. A very simple collaborative mapping application would just plot users' locations (social mapping or geosocial networking) or Wikipedia articles' locations (Placeopedia). Collaborative implies the possibility of edition by several distinct individuals so the term would tend to exclude applications where the maps are not meant for the general user to modify. In this kind of application, the map itself is created collaboratively by sharing a common surface. For example, both OpenStreetMap and WikiMapia allow for the creation of single 'points of interest', as well as linear features and areas. Collaborative mapping and specifically surface sharing faces the same problems as revision control, namely concurrent access issues and versioning. In addition to these problems, collaborative maps must deal with the difficult issue of cluttering, due to the geometric constraints inherent in the media. One approach to this problem is using overlays, allowing to suitable use in consumer services.Parker, C.J., May, A., Mitchell, V. and Burrows, A. (2013), “Capturing Volunteered Information for Inclusive Service Design: Potential Benefits and Challenges”, The Design Journal, Vol. 16 No. 2, pp. 197–218. Despite these issues, collaborative mapping platforms such as OpenStreetMap can be considered as being as trustworthy as professionally produced mapsParker, C.J., May, A.J. and Mitchell, V. (2014), “User Centred Design of Neogeography: The Impact of Volunteered Geographic Information on Trust of Online Map ‘Mashups’”, Ergonomics, Vol. 57 No. 7, pp. 987–997. Overlays group together items on a map, allowing the user of the map to toggle the overlay's visibility and thus all items contained in the overlay. The application uses map tiles from a third-party (for example one of the mapping APIs) and adds its own collaboratively edited overlays to them, sometimes in a wiki fashion. If each user's revisions are contained in an overlay, the issue of revision control and cluttering can be mitigated. One example of this is the accessibility platform Accessadvisr, which utilises collaborative mapping to inform persons of accessibility issues,May, A.J., Parker, C.J. and Ross, T. (2014), “Evaluating a concept design of a crowd-sourced ‘mashup’ providing ease-of-access information for people with limited mobility”, Transportation Research. Part C: Emerging Technologies, Vol. 49 No. 1, pp. 103–113. which is perceived to be as reliable and trustworthy as professional information.Parker, C.J., May, A.J. and Mitchell, V. (2012), “Understanding Design with VGI using an Information Relevance Framework”, Transactions in GIS, Transactions in GIS: GISRUK Special Issue, Vol. 16 No. 4, pp. 545–560. Other overlays-based collaborative mapping tools follow a different approach and focus on user centered content creation and experience. There users enrich maps with their own points of interest and build kind of travel books for themselves. At the same time users can explore overlays of other users as collaborative extension.

Suitable for large scale crowdsourcing projects.  Quality assurance  If citizens or a community collects data, information (like Wikipedia, Wikiversity) then concerns come up about data quality, and specifically about its credibility. The same aspects of quality assurance are relevant for collaborative mapping and the possibility of vandalism.  Data collection tools  Collaborative mapping is not restricted to the application of mobile devices but if data is captured with a mobile device the satellite navigation (like GPS is helpful to assign the current geolocation to the collected data at the geolocation. Open Source tools like Open Data Kit are used to collect the mapping data (e.g. about health care facilities or humanitarian operations) with a survey that could automatically insert the geolocation into the survey data that could include visual information (e.g. images, videos) and audio samples collected at the current geolocation. An image can be used e.g. as additional information of damage assessment after an earth quake.Barrington, L., Ghosh, S., Greene, M., Har-Noy, S., Berger, J., Gill, S., Lin, A.Y.M., Huyck, C., 2011.

Any changes in the joint repository of the mapping process are captured by a version control system- Reverting changes is possible and specific quality assured versions of specific areas can be marked as reference map for a specific area (like permanent links in Wikipedia).

Infanterie-Division (Chronik 1915/1918) It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was a Royal Saxon division, made up of troops from that kingdom. It was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of regular infantry divisions which were being triangularized. The division's 245th Infantry Brigade was the former 64th Infantry Brigade of the 32nd (3rd Royal Saxon) Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 178th Infantry Regiment. The 106th Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 24th (2nd Royal Saxon) Reserve Division and the 182nd Infantry Regiment came from the 23rd (1st Royal Saxon) Infantry Division. Combat chronicle The 123rd Infantry Division initially fought on the Western Front in World War I, entering the line in the Aisne region in mid- April 1915. Later in 1915, it fought in the Battle of Loos. It remained on the front in the Flanders and Artois regions into 1916, and in July entered the Battle of the Somme, where it reportedly lost 6,000 men. It was transferred to the Eastern Front at the end of the month, where it went into the line near Lake Narač until November 1917, when it returned to the Western Front. It went into the line near Verdun until May 1918. It later fought in the Second Battle of the Marne and then returned to the line near Verdun. Late in 1918, it faced the Allied Meuse-Argonne Offensive. It remained in the line until the end of the war. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class and of mediocre combat value.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 620-622.

In the 1960s, he played organ trio gigs in Los Angeles and did session work with singers and guitarists such as Jerry McGee and Rick Vito. In the 1970s, he toured with Don Preston, and recorded with Delaney & Bonnie. Allen moved to New Orleans in the 1980s, where he played and recorded with a number of blues and cajun performers including Ernie K-Doe, King Floyd, Freddy Fender, Marcia Ball. Career =Early years= Allen was born near Los Angeles in the mid-1940s, and he began playing drums at age five, guitar at age seven, piano at nine and Hammond Organ at age 11. He practiced in department stores and churches, because his parents could not afford an organ. Blues and R&B; were very popular in Los Angeles in the 1950s. As a boy, Allen listened to performers such as Howlin’ Wolf, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy, John Lee Hooker, and Muddy Waters. At age eighteen, he joined The Bonnevilles, a touring band from Milwaukee led by guitarist Larry Lynne. The group played nightclubs all around the Midwestern states, and accompanied Jimmy Clanton in Milwaukee and Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson in California. They also played with The Olympics. In the 1960s, Allen started to learn the jazz organ styles of Hammond Organ virtuoso Jimmy Smith. =1960s= In 1964, Allen and Larry Lynne formed a band called “The Skunks”, and as a gimmick, the band members dyed their hair black, and bleached white “skunk-stripes” on the sides. The Skunks were signed with Chess Records in Chicago, where they recorded two songs. Sonny Boy Williamson played harmonica on one of the tunes, “Fanny Mae”, but the record was never released. In California, Allen played with jazz tenor sax player Tom Fabre, and began playing organ trio gigs in Watts and South Central Los Angeles. The group played the “off nights” in the jazz clubs that booked Jimmy Smith, \\"Groove\\" Holmes, Shirley Scott and Baby Face Willette. Allen began playing in Hollywood on the Sunset Strip at The Galaxy in the band Al and the Originals. The lead singer was Bobby Angelle and the guitarist was Arthur Adams. After Allen left, Dennis Provisor took his place in the band. With Angelle, Rick recorded some songs on Liberty Records with Dr. John and former Raylettes’ Clydie King, Shirley Matthews and Venetta Fields. Allen also worked with Etta James for several weeks at the Californian Club in L.A. Bobby Angelle, Arthur Adams and he also recorded songs on Money Records. Allen played with a band called Blue Rose, and did session work with singer Joanne Vent on A&M; Records, and Genya Ravan, (with guitarists Jerry McGee and Rick Vito, plus drummer Eddie Tuduri) on ABC Records. =1970s and 1980s= In 1973, Allen went on a national tour with Dalton and Dubarri. In 1974, Rick went on the road again, this time with Don Preston, guitarist for Leon Russell. They played show clubs from New York to California, and recorded an album in San Francisco for Shelter Records. Also in 1974, Rick did several recordings with Delaney Bramlett, including an album for MGM Records and two albums for Motown Records. In 1978, Rick went on tour with Bonnie Bramlett, for Capricorn Records. Allen and his wife Anne moved to New Orleans in 1983, and Allen began working in blues clubs with Mighty Sam McClain and drummer Kerry Brown. Later, he worked with Ernie K-Doe, (Mother In Law), Jesse Hill, Bobby Mitchell, Johnny Adams, Jay Monque’D, King Floyd, C.P.Love, The Boogie Kings, and Guitar Slim Junior.” In 1991, Allen began doing studio work at Allen Toussaint’s Sea Saint Studios in New Orleans with producer/engineer Roger Branch. Allen contributed to many albums at Sea Saint, including recordings by slide guitar bluesman Brint Anderson, Freddy Fender, Marcia Ball and Robert “Barefootin” Parker. He played on Orleans Records recordings by artists like Cajun blues singer Coco Robicheaux, blues singers Rocky Charles, Little Freddie King, Mighty Sam McClain and others. =1990s= In 2000, Allen was nominated for a Grammy Award with The Dukes of Dixieland and drummer Richard Taylor, for the album Gloryland. In the 2000s, Allen and his wife Anne lived in the bayou country of south Louisiana.

It was first published in the January 1952 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. Plot summary In the near future, humanity is divided into two groups: normal humans and Teleks. Teleks have the ability to move objects using only the power of their minds. The telekinetic ability is said to be partly hereditary and partly learned. The story takes place sixty years after the Teleks first appeared; most of the four thousand Teleks are second- generation, having acquired the ability shortly after birth. The Teleks live apart from normal humans in Glarietta Pavilion, a floating city. They collect precious metals from the moon and other planets which they use to purchase menial labor and other services from ordinary human beings. The story opens with an attack on a Telek by an enraged worker, followed by the murder of the Telek. A witness, named Shorn, who is a member of a subversive society, arranges for the body to be disposed of. The murderer is caught and killed, presumably by the Teleks. The remainder of the story follows Shorn as he infiltrates Telek society and persuades a Telek to give him telekinetic powers. In the final scene, Shorn brings 265 normal humans disguised as Teleks to the first annual Telek convention, where he tricks the assembled Teleks into giving the humans telekinetic powers.

He would have been 84 years old by this time. The 1908 Atlas of Parke County doesn't show any property near the bridge being owned by anyone in the Neet family while Enoch Shrigley referred to it as the Joe Neet Bridge. Joseph W. Neet had been born in 1862 and owned 176 acres in section 33, the bridge is on the west side of section 33. George M. Neet, born in 1869, rented 20 acres north of the bridge.http://www.indianagenweb.com/inparke/Maps/1905ParkeCountyAtlasAdamsTownship.jpg Robert E. Detrich later owned property at the bridge through 1959 and by 1990 owned 40 acres further from the bridge which is listed as Detrich Tree Farm. The Central Indiana Railroad crossed Little Raccoon Creek just north of the bridge. On March 25, 1989 Rockville Boy Scout Troop 469 repainted the bridge with 4 gallons of paint. A note on the bridge credits Ted Gahimer, Bruce Girdler, Matt Garrett, and Shawn Taylor as the painters. As of 2010 the bridge and area around it were being maintained by neighbors Bob Lowdermilk and John Tilton.

The Verizon Building was designed in the Art Deco style by Ralph Walker of Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker, and was Walker's first major commission as well as one of the first Art Deco skyscrapers. It occupies the entire block bounded by West Street to the west, Barclay Street to the north, Vesey Street to the south, and Washington Street to the east, abutting the World Trade Center. The Verizon Building was constructed from 1923 to 1927 as the Barclay–Vesey Building. It served as the longtime corporate headquarters of New York Telephone and its successor Verizon Communications. The building, being adjacent to the original World Trade Center to the south and 7 World Trade Center to the east, experienced major damage in the September 11 attacks following the collapse of the World Trade Center. Restoration of the building and damaged communications infrastructure after the attacks took three years and cost $1.4 billion. Part of the building was converted into 100 Barclay, a residential condominium development, in 2016. The Verizon Building was built to have an imposing form, with vertical piers designed as buttresses; setbacks at upper floors; and a program of elaborate ornamentation on the exterior and interior. The Verizon Building's design has been widely praised by architectural critics, both for its design scheme and for its symbolism. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, and its exterior and first-floor interior were declared city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1991.  Site  The Verizon Building is located in the Financial District/Tribeca neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan. It occupies an entire city block bounded by West Street to the west, Vesey Street and the World Trade Center to the south, Washington Street to the east, and Barclay Street to the north. Adjacent buildings include 7 World Trade Center to the east and One World Trade Center to the south. The block is parallelogram-shaped, measuring about along West and Washington Streets, along Vesey and Barclay Streets. The total area of the block is . Prior to the 19th century, the Verizon Building's site was located off the shore of the North River (now Hudson River), but the shore from Vesey Street north to King Street was infilled during the mid-19th century, and docks were constructed west of West Street. A wholesale market called the Washington Market was established on the future Verizon Building block in 1812 or 1813. To support the market and the nearby food businesses, about 35 three- to five- story brick structures were erected on the block. By the time the Verizon Building was erected, the site was located along the shoreline of the Hudson River. In the 1970s, Battery Park City was built on filled land along the shore, severing the Verizon Building from the waterfront. Design Berenice Abbott image of the Barclay–Vesey Building, 1936 The Verizon Building was designed by Ralph Thomas Walker in the Art Deco style, although it was described at the time of its completion as being \\"Modernistic\\" or \\"Modern Perpendicular\\". The Verizon Building measures tall and contains 32 stories, with mezzanines above the ground, 17th, and 31st stories. The Verizon Building is regarded by architectural critics as being the first Art Deco skyscraper. It was also the first major structure that Walker designed for McKenzie, Voorhees & Gmelin, and as such, was aesthetically distinguished from the firm's previous commissions. Walker intended the Barclay–Vesey Building to be \\"as modern as the telephone activity it houses\\". His design took several elements from Eliel Saarinen's proposal for Chicago's Tribune Tower, as well as from Walker's own entry in the design competition for the Tribune Tower. Such elements included the Verizon Building's setbacks or architectural recessions; its vertical piers; and its pyramidal roof, which had been a defining feature of Walker's Tribune Tower proposal. The Verizon Building's architecture has been compared to San Antonio's Milam Building, the largest pre-stressed concrete and brick office building and the first to have an integrated designed-in air conditioning system. Walker subsequently designed other Art Deco buildings in the New York City area, such as the New Jersey Bell Headquarters Building (1929), 60 Hudson Street (1930), 1 Wall Street (1931), and 32 Avenue of the Americas (1932), as well as telephone buildings in Upstate New York. = Form = The Verizon Building contains numerous setbacks on its exterior. Though setbacks in New York City skyscrapers were mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution in order to allow light and air to reach the streets below, they later became a defining feature of the Art Deco style. The lowest ten floors of the Verizon Building occupy the entire block area. Above the 10th floor, there are setbacks on the north and south facades, as well as narrow and deep light courts to the west and east, creating an \\"H\\"-shaped floor plan from the 11th to the 17th floors. There are smaller setbacks at each corner on the 13th floor. The building rises as a tower above the 17th floor, though smaller wings flank the tower's northern and southern facades on the 18th and 19th floors. The rectangular tower is aligned with buildings on Broadway to the east, and so is parallel to Barclay and Vesey Streets. During the design process, Walker had considered plans for \\"a series of stacked blocks connected by blunt transitions\\", though this proposal lacked a unified sense of character. The appearance of unity was later attained through the inclusion of piers on the facade. The Verizon Building's form was also influenced by its interior use. There were numerous functions that did not necessitate sunlight and could operate using artificial light, such as the central operating system and the mechanical space, which was placed inside the building's core. The office space, conversely, was placed on the exterior walls, so the Verizon Building did not require light courts that were as extensive as in nearby buildings. Also as a result, the base could occupy the entire lot area, with setbacks located on higher levels than in other office buildings. = Facade = Top floors Walker was inspired by Maya architecture in designing the facade. Above the granite base, the exterior is clad with brick in hues of green, gold, and buff, a material that Walker preferred for its texture and color. There is cast-stone ornamentation on the building's upper floors, as well as patterned motifs and limestone decoration on the lower floors; when possible, these features were created using the help of machines. The Verizon Building also contains serrated stone-and-light-brick parapets, which, when combined with the building's vertical piers, give a naturalistic \\"alpine\\" look to the setbacks. When taken as a whole, the materials of the facade were intended to give an impression of stability and mass. The facade also serves a protective purpose: the steel frame is enclosed within , heavy masonry in the exterior infill walls. The western and eastern facades of the Verizon Building consist of 19 vertical bays, and the northern and southern facades contain 23 bays. Walker sought to incorporate a program of ornament to attract the interests of passersby and to temper the building's large mass. For the Barclay–Vesey Building, Walker eschewed traditional motifs, such as egg-and-dart patterns, which he saw as clichéd. He wrote that the decorative elements should be \\"so complicated in its structure as not to be readily comprehended; its framework should be as hidden as the steel structure itself.\\" The ornamental program on the facade was carried out by Ulysses Ricci and John De Cesare. It includes complex foliage; babies and animal heads; and a bell above the door, symbolizing the telephone company. Though Walker characterized the ornamental program as \\"free and flowing\\", it was actually rigid and complex. Architectural critic Lewis Mumford stated that the ornamental program at ground level was so extensive that it was \\"a rock garden\\".  Base  The main facades are on West and Washington Streets to the east and west, respectively. At the center of each side, there are large entrance portals that are three bays wide and two stories tall. These portals contain bronze-framed doorways with decorative motifs. Above the doors are bronze screens with vine-and-grape ornamentation; these formerly also contained motifs of bells to represent the New York Telephone Company. The main entrance portals are framed with a decorative limestone lintel depicting a bird and human figures. The limestone friezes above each set of doors depict a bell flanked by a Mongolian and a Native American, which respectively symbolize the Eastern world and the Western world. On the West Street facade, the main entrance portal is flanked on either side by two single-width double- height bays, a triple-width double-height bay, and another single-width double-height bay. These double-height bays contain storefronts. From top to bottom, the storefronts at the base are generally composed of a solid panel, glazed glass, and a decorative transom. alt= There is an enclosed, arched arcade above the Vesey Street sidewalk on the southern facade, measuring long by wide and tall. There are 12 arches in total; each corresponds to two window bays above, except the westernmost arch, which corresponds to one window bay. The arches are supported by brick piers while the ceilings are composed of Guastavino tiles. The arcade was a compromise design because the city wanted to expand the street during the building's construction, while Walker wanted a larger base. The arcade was called \\"one of the most comfortable shopping fronts in New York City\\" when the Barclay–Vesey Building was completed, but because it was so dark, the arcade did not receive too much pedestrian traffic. Nevertheless, numerous enterprises were located in the arcade, including a circulating library. The Vesey Street storefronts were converted to office space by the 2000s. The north facade also contains storefronts set within double-width, double-height arches. Two of the central arches were converted into rectangular garage openings.  Upper stories  On the second through 32nd floors, the window design is mostly consistent. Most window openings contain three-over-three sash windows, though some openings have been covered with louvered grates, especially in places where there are mechanical or communications equipment. The second-story windows are generally topped by elaborate triangular limestone surrounds that contain carvings of birds, grapes, and vines, except at the corners of the building, where the second-story windows contain lintels and sills with carvings of grapes and vines. The third-story windows also contain sills with grape and vine carvings. The fourth- through 32nd-story windows have plain, undecorated sills and windows. Each window bay is separated by vertical limestone piers. Above the 28th story especially, there are cast-stone decorative elements. The 30th floor, 31st floor, and 31st-floor mezzanine contains five triple-height arched windows on each facade. Stone piers protrude above the rooftop level, which contains some mechanical equipment. = Features = In his design for the Verizon Building, Walker believed that the structure should serve \\"as a machine which had definite functions to perform for the benefit of its occupants.\\" The design scheme for the interior is a continuation of that on the facade, which was a relatively rare stylistic choice of the time, since many contemporary buildings were being designed with modern-styled exteriors and historically-styled interiors. Mumford likened this continuity in interior and exterior design to the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Henry Hobson Richardson, and Louis Sullivan, which also exhibited such consistency. As with the exterior, there is masonry encasing interior structures. Brick, cinder, concrete, and other masonry materials encase interior steel columns, beams, girders, and other structural elements. Walker also created the interior elements by machine when it was possible. The interior space covers . The structure was split into two different mechanical sections: the 18th through 32nd floors, and the basements through the 16th floor. The 17th floor housed the mechanical equipment, which was unusual since other buildings' mechanical equipment were usually contained on their roofs or in their basements. There are 26 elevators to transport tenants to upper floors. The second through 16th floors are served by two elevator lobbies, while the 18th through 32nd floors are served by a single elevator lobby.  Lobby  The lobby runs between the West and Washington Street entrances to the west and east, with a vaulted ceiling. The interior of the lobby includes buff-colored veined marble walls and floors. Toward the center of the lobby, there are two alcoves each on the north and south walls, which lead to the elevator banks. The northern alcoves both contain eight elevators while the southern alcoves both contain four elevators. All of the elevator alcoves contain painted ceilings and ornate bronze fixtures for ventilation and lights. A telephone alcove is also located off the lobby. Since the upper floors' residential overhaul in the 2010s, the western half of the lobby is still used by Verizon, but the eastern half is used as a residents' lounge. The decoration program of the lobby is also in the Art Deco style. These works were designed by Ricci and De Cesare, and executed by Edgar Williams and Mack, Jenney & Tyler. The elevator doors are framed by bronze surrounds, while the elevator lobbies feature Levanto marble walls. Other doorways leading from the lobby, as well as the fluted pilasters along the lobby's length, are also made of Levanto marble. The doors from the lobby are made of bronze, as are the capitals of the pilasters, which incorporate grape-and-vine motifs. The lobby features inlaid bronze medallions in the floor, which depict the construction of the telephone system. The medallion on the eastern side depicts a female telephone operator, and that on the western side depicts a lineworker. There are twelve ceiling murals that depict how human communication has progressed, from Aztec runners to the telephone. Nine murals—five at the western entrance and four at the eastern entrance—demonstrate the ancient methods of communication. The three center murals depict modern communication. Bronze chandeliers with complex ornamentation hang from the ceiling over the bronze medallions on the floor. On the ceiling are \\"angelic figures\\", which appear to be holding the chandeliers.  Other floors  The lowest ten floors above the basements were intended for use as office space serving the central telephone offices, and could handle live structural loads of up to , depending on the intended uses of each floor section. The 29th floor included New York Telephone's executive offices, and the 31st floor contained an assembly room that could hold 6,500 workers. When the Barclay–Vesey Building opened, it contained an auditorium at ground level and a gymnasium on the ground floor's mezzanine. There was also a training school for workers. The stories above the 10th floor have been converted into 157 luxury condominium units. There is a separate lobby for residents on the Barclay Street side, which connects to the original lobby. The penthouse apartment, a duplex unit on the 31st and 32nd floors, covers with a living room, advertised as the largest in the city. The building also contains an wading pool and a lap pool. Other features of the residential portion of the Verizon Building include rooms for wine-tasting and billiards; music practice; a fitness center; a children's playroom; and a residents' lounge. The Verizon Building has five sub-basement levels, which house communications equipment. At the time of the September 11 attacks, Verizon was using the building as a main telecommunications switching center in Lower Manhattan, handling approximately 200,000 phone lines and 3.6 million data circuits. These circuits traveled as far north as 42nd Street. In emergencies, the 17th floor could provide services to the building's base. History = Planning and construction =  Planning  1920s image of the Barclay–Vesey Building, seen from east. The building was surrounded by food markets and the building was on the waterfront (background). The New York Telephone Company began to grow rapidly after World War I. An internal review of the organizational structure found that its New York City operations were housed in multiple buildings across the city, and were thus inefficient. The company's president from 1919 to 1924, Howard Ford Thurber, sought to centralize the company's operations into a single large headquarters to \\"satisfy the present demands and to reasonably anticipate future requirements\\". In the early 1920s, the New York Telephone Company started acquiring the entire block between West, Barclay, Washington, and Vesey Streets. The site was chosen \\"because real estate values in that vicinity were much lower\\" compared to the area around Broadway. The company owned the entire block by 1923, by which it had spent $1.5 million on acquisitions. In April 1923, the company announced that it intended to build a new headquarters at a projected cost of $11.5 million. The structure was to house 6,000 employees from the company's six central offices, who would work with 120,000 telephones, as well as mechanical equipment to support the company's equipment. The initial design called for a height of , with of office space, and of commercial ground-floor storefronts. In addition, the building would be erected with a steel-and-concrete frame, as well as facade trim made of limestone and buff-colored brick. The building was to be designed by Ralph Walker of Kenzie, Voorhees & Gmelin, who wanted to create a \\"strong corporate image\\" for the structure. At the time, construction was expected to be completed in July 1925. It is likely that Walker started planning the Barclay–Vesey Building in late 1922, while he was still designing the Tribune Building. Walker sought to ensure that the proposed headquarters would comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution while also being spacious and relatively inexpensive. Accordingly, he created designs for buildings containing 10, 16, 26, 29, 32, 36, and 42 floors. Walker also tested out different architectural styles, such as the Gothic and Italian Renaissance styles, before settling on a \\"modernistic\\" Art Deco style. The 32-story proposal, with setbacks at the 10th, 13th, 17th, and 19th floors, was ultimately deemed the most efficient. The blueprints for the 32-story proposal were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings in June 1923.  Construction  Foundation work began on June 20, 1923, and since the site was mostly artificial fill with riprap buttressing, water from the Hudson River sometimes leaked through to the foundation. The building's foundation needed to descend to the level of the bedrock, and the earth was described as having a slimy consistency below water level. Since the bedrock was deeper than originally anticipated, this allowed the builders to include five basement levels, rather than four. To keep out the water and slime-like earth, the builders erected a cofferdam with 22 caissons. The builders then laid down permanent steel struts to hold back the cofferdam; not only was this likely the first such use of steel bracing, it saved $30,000 compared to the temporary wood bracing that had been used in previous projects. During construction, almost 700 workers were employed for the project at any given time; tradesmen, such as plumbers and electricians, worked with concrete and steel contractors in overlapping shifts, in order to reduce delays. The superstructure incorporated of steel across its above- ground and below-ground sections, and the builders used six derricks to lift the girders from the street. Four temporary stairways, each containing 351 steps, were built to facilitate the construction of the upper floors. The floor arches were built starting in October 1924, and on average, one floor was completed per week. New York Telephone's vice president James S. McCulloh placed both the first and the last rivets. The first employees moved to the Barclay–Vesey Building on February 19, 1926. All construction on the Barclay–Vesey Building was completed by June 1926. However, the New York City Department of Buildings did not declare the building to be completed until April 1927. =20th-century use= Southern facade; 7 World Trade Center is visible at right New York Telephone originally had four dial telephone exchanges at the Barclay–Vesey Building. Two additional exchanges were activated in 1928, which would be able to serve 125,000 additional subscribers; at the time, Lower Manhattan was one of the busiest telephone districts in the world. During the mid-20th century, office space was gradually removed to make room for additional equipment. In 1970, the company signed an agreement to move its executive offices to 1095 Avenue of the Americas, a proposed 53-story speculative development near Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, which would be larger than the existing West Street offices. Two years later, the New York Telephone offices had moved out of the Barclay–Vesey Building, though the switching offices remained. When NYNEX was formed as a result of the breakup of the original AT&T; in 1984, the building became NYNEX's headquarters. Improvements in technology resulted in the invention of smaller telephone equipment, leading to an increase in available office space at the Barclay–Vesey Building. By the 1990s, some office workers were moving back into the Barclay–Vesey Building. The exteriors and ground- floor lobbies of the Barclay–Vesey Building and two other telecommunications buildings were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1991. New York Telephone supported the designation, and the company's own media had previously described the building as a \\"landmark\\". The Barclay–Vesey Building became the headquarters of Bell Atlantic following Bell Atlantic's 1997 merger with NYNEX. Subsequently, in 2000, the building became Verizon Communications' headquarters after Verizon was formed from the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. =21st-century use= Damage and restoration At the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Verizon Building was being renovated. The Verizon Building had been adjacent to 7 World Trade Center to the east and the World Trade Center's Twin Towers to the south, and when the three buildings collapsed during the attacks, the south and east facades were severely damaged by falling steel beams. The collapse of the World Trade Center causing partial collapses on some floor slabs close to the windows, though the building as a whole was not in immediate danger of collapse. Debris also sliced water mains, flooding the basements. As a result, underground cable vaults belonging to Verizon, along with other underground utility infrastructure, were heavily damaged from water and debris. The Verizon Building received only moderate damage because its thick-masonry design gave the building added strength. The masonry allowed the structure to absorb much of the energy from debris hitting the building, and damage was restricted mostly to impact points. Although no fires were observed in the Verizon Building, the ground-floor murals were damaged by smoke. Tishman Realty & Construction, which had been planning work on the building prior to the attacks, did a quick assessment of the building in the days after the attack. William F. Collins AIA Architects was the lead architectural firm working on the restoration, while Tishman Interiors managed the project. The Excalibur Bronze Foundry and Petrillo Stone were hired as specialists to restore the intricate ornamental detail in the facade and in the lobby. Facade restoration involved carving motif designs in the ornamental limestone, and restoring the ceiling murals in the lobby. For the murals in the lobby, hypodermic needles were used to inject acrylic resin to restore the paint and plaster. On the executive office floors, workers restored the barrel-vaulted ceilings, plaster friezes, and other elements. Restoration of the building also involved replacing a corner column; A+ Construction of Rye, New York was responsible for this work. The building's 23 elevators were also upgraded, new fire alarms, building command systems, and chillers installed, and restrooms made accessible to those with disabilities. Restoration of the building took three years, at a cost of $1.4 billion. The New York Times stated that the project would cost \\"three-quarters of the Chrysler Building's estimated total value.\\" Throughout the restoration, the building continued to serve as a telephone switching center. In 2004, the New York Landmarks Conservancy awarded Tishman Interiors the Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for its restoration work on the Verizon Building. The restoration was complete by late 2005. That December, Verizon announced it would move its offices from 1095 Avenue of the Americas to 140 West Street, where there would be space for 1,500 employees; the operations hub was relocated to Verizon's campus in Basking Ridge, New Jersey. The Verizon Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.  Partial sale and residential conversion  Close-up of exterior corner decoration The building was partially flooded by storm surges from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which seeped into the basement levels, took all except one of the elevators out of service, and damaged the lobby murals. The next year, Verizon sold off the top floors to developer Ben Shaoul, the head of Magnum Real Estate. Verizon retained the 28th and 29th floors as well as the ground through 10th stories. In conjunction with this sale, Verizon moved 1,100 employees to Downtown Brooklyn and relocated others to 1095 Avenue of the Americas. To prevent against future flood damage, Verizon installed a storm surge barrier in front of the building. Following Verizon's sale of the top floors, it was announced that Magnum Real Estate would convert the upper floors to a condominium complex known as 100 Barclay. Shaoul and the CIM Group added 157 units to the Verizon Building, and the condos were first listed for sale in early 2016. However, 100 Barclay's residential units remained largely unoccupied by 2019, leading Magnum Real Estate to reduce the penthouse's asking price from $59 million to $39 million. To fill up the unused units, Magnum Real Estate also started advertising to renters.  Critical reception  The Barclay–Vesey Building received much positive acclaim when it was completed. New York Telephone dubbed the headquarters \\"a symbol of service and progress\\", while Mumford said that the design \\"expresses the achievements of contemporary American architecture...better than any other skyscraper I have seen.\\" Joseph Pennell called the Barclay–Vesey Building \\"the most impressive modern building in the world\\", and Talbot Hamlin predicted it would be \\"a monument of American progress in architecture.\\" The building was on the frontispiece of the English version of Toward an Architecture by Le Corbusier, such was its stature. These favorable reviews have continued through the 21st century: the 2009 Guide to New York City Landmarks described the building as \\"one of the most significant structures in skyscraper design\\". The design received awards from civic groups as well. In February 1927, the Architectural League of New York awarded Walker a gold medal of honor for the design, lauding its \\"quality of excellence\\" and saying that \\"A result has been achieved expressive of a high degree of skill and good taste in both general mass and in interesting detail.\\" That October, the Broadway Association gave the New York Telephone Company an award for the Barclay–Vesey Building, calling it a \\"contribution to civic advancement.\\" Praise also focused on specific elements of the Barclay–Vesey Building. The architect Harvey Wiley Corbett said that the ornamental program was \\"straightforward and appropriate and eminently right\\". Following the September 11 attacks, Verizon's corporate-real-estate manager praised the Verizon Building's resilience, referring to the building as a \\"tank\\". There were also some negative reviews. In 1991, New York Times architectural writer Phillip Lopate stated that \\"the corporate publicity aspects of the Barclay–Vesey lobby seem, by today's standards, overdone and kitschy\\" compared to Walker's later 60 Hudson Street commission, which was austere. Furthermore, though Mumford largely liked the design, he found the base–tower transition and the building's general shape to be an \\"annoying defect\\".

Distribution The Sierra Madre Oriental range to the west separates the Tamaulipan mezquital from the drier Chihuahuan Desert. The Tamaulipan matorral is a transitional ecoregion between the mezquital and the Sierra Madre Oriental pine-oak forests to the west and the Veracruz moist forests to the south. The Western Gulf coastal grasslands, known as the Tamaulipan pastizal south of the border, fringe the Gulf of Mexico. The Edwards Plateau savannas lie to the north, and the East Central Texas forests and Texas blackland prairies to the northeast.

The Bordas Escarpment transects this ecoregion, running from near the southern limit northwest to the vicinity of Rio Grande City, Texas, arching back northeast to the vicinity of Choke Canyon Reservoir in Texas. The region east of the Bordas Escarpment is flat with deep, sandy soils, of which vast areas both north and south of the boarder have been converted to agricultural use. West of the Bordas Escarpment the topography changes to gently rolling hills with a thin layer of high calcium soil over a thick layer of caliche. Some large portions of the west are poorly suited for cultivation but good for ranching and excellent wildlife habitat.Fulbright, Timothy E., and Fred C. Bryant (2004).The Last Great Habitat. A Special Publication of the Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M; University-Kingsville. Special Publication No. 1, 1-32 pp. A series of Cenozoic strata of limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and claystone occur throughout most of the region. These strata are slightly tilted, gently slanting seaward, with increasingly recent exposures to the east, including some Quaternary bodies at the coast transitioning into the sea, and a few older Cretaceous exposures and outcrops appearing in some far western interior areas. Elevations generally range from near sea level to 300 meters, transitioning at ca. 300-500 meters into the Sierra Madres, Edwards Plateau, and Chihuahua Desert in western areas. A series of small mountain ranges occur in the region, isolated on the coastal plain between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Gulf of Mexico. These ranges are not part of the strata of the Gulf Coast Plain or the complexly folded and faulted Jurassic and Cretaceous formations of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The Sierra de San Carlos, (and Sierra de Tamaulipas just beyond the southern limit of this ecoregion) are plutons, igneous rock intrusions of nepheline syenite to gabbroic composition, emplaced during the Mid-Tertiary with a few minor sierras of alkaline basalt flows occurring locally (e.g. in the vicinity of Llera, Tamaulipas).

Biological Diversity of Mexico: Origins and Distribution. Oxford University Press, Inc. New York. The Coastal Sand Plain, sometimes referred to as the \\"Wild Horse Desert\\", is a region of Quaternary sand deposits extending about 60 miles inland from the Laguna Madre. It is bordered by Baffin Bay to the north and the Lower Rio Grande Valley to the south. Quaternary to Tertiary marine sedimentary strata, which may be exposed in western areas, underlie the sand sheet. The sand sheet is six feet deep in many places with maximum dune elevations reaching 30 feet. Although the area is generally flat, the unstable sands often form a dune and swale topography where vegetated dunes are interspersed with active, unstable, wind-blow dunes. The active dunes attain areas as large as 250 acres, predominantly in the eastern third. Grasslands cover much of the sand plain where seacoast bluestem (Schizachyrium littorale) is dominant in all but the wettest areas. These grasslands are banded with live oak (Quercus virginiana) groves, forming dense forest in spots, and smaller honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) mottes in discontinuous belts which are sometimes connected with one another and collectively cover at least a quarter of the sand sheet. Numerous ephemeral, internally drained ponds form where subsidence and blow-outs occur.Fuibright, Timothy E., David D. Diamond, John Rappoie, and Jim Norwine. 1990. Coastal Sand Plain of Southern Texas. Rangelands 12(6): 337-340. Hydrology: The region is generally semi-arid however, various wetlands are present. The Laguna Madre is one of only five hypersaline coastal lagoons (or negative estuaries) in the world and a significant ecosystem in itself, laying between the Gulf of Mexico and the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion.Tunnell, Jr. John W. and Frank W. Judd. editors. (2002). The Laguna Madre of Texas and Tamaulipas. Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, Texas. xxi, 346 pp. As one moves inland from the hypersaline lagoon, a relatively narrow band of freshwater marshlands are encountered running north to south, albeit occurring fragmented and irregularly. These marshes are dynamic, fluctuating with rainfall and tropical storm activity, and alternating with wet and dry periods. When and where present, these marshlands can be locally, surprisingly extensive with deep marshes and both permanent and ephemeral freshwater ponds that support populations of salamanders (Sirens), turtles (Trachemys), and millions of migrating waterfowl, such as redheads (Aythya americana) in the winter.Smith, Elizabeth H.

Many of these river have created innumerable oxbow lakes, resacas, and abandoned channels with associated marshes and swamps as they meander across the flat coastal plain east of the Bordas Escarpment. The few remaining riparian zones in this region that have not been cleared for agriculture, housing, and industry, can support unexpectedly lush tropical jungle vegetation, particularly in the south. The San Antonio River (a major tributary of the Guadalupe River) runs at the approximate northeastern border of this region. Other major rivers (north to south) include: the Nueces River and its tributary the Frio River; Rio Grande (referred to as Rio Bravo in Mexico) and its tributaries Rio Salado, Rio San Juan; the Rio San Fernando (sometimes called the Rio Conchos and not to be confused with the major drainage Rio Conchos of Chihuahua); the Rio Soto La Marina and its tributaries Rio San Carlos, Rio Pilón, San Antonio, Rio Purificacion, Rio Corona, Rio Santa Ana, form the approximate southern border.Texas Water Development Board, TWDB Maps: Major Surface Water Features.Agustin Palacios Roji Grcía and Joaquin Palacios Roji Grcía.

Cassell's Spanish-English Dictionary. Cassell Ltd. London and Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc. New York. xxv, 1109 pp. ), thorny brush, and chaparral vegetation referred to as Tamaulipan thornscrub. In this subtropical environment some plant growth continues through most the year, particularly in the south. Years with droughts or tropical storms and hurricanes can dramatically affect vegetation at any given locality, particularly the herbaceous ground layer, which may be sparse with patches of bare earth in a dry year, or thick and verdant in a wet year. Thornscrub vegetation tends to grow taller and thicker in the east, benefited by coastal moisture where it can be impenetrable in places, and it is often shorter and more open in interior areas of the region, although soils also influence this throughout the region.Blair, W. Frank. (1950). The Biotic Provinces of Texas. Texas Journal of Science. 2(1): 93-117.Martin, Paul S., C. Richard Robins, and William B. Heed. 1954. Birds and Biogeography of the Sierra de Tamaulipas, an Isolated Pine-Oak Habitat.The Wilson Bulletin.Vol. 66, No. 1: 38-57. Mixtures of sand and clay make up much of the soils with pockets of near pure sand and near pure clay occurring locally.Richardson, Alfred and Ken King. 2011. Plants of Deep South Texas, A Field Guide to the Woody and Flowering Species. Texas A&M; University Press. College Station, Texas. xii, 457 pp. Sandy soils in this region tend to support more open vegetation with widely spaced trees and shrubs in grasslands, while clay soils tend to support a greater diversity and denser, sometimes even canopied areas of trees and shrubs. Past land usage can also have a significant influence, where recently cleared areas may have a near monoculture of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), with pricklypear (Opuntia engelmannii var. lindheimeri), and non-native grasses in the understory.Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Savanna Grassland (Accessed: 18 August 2020). Some species of are nearly ubiquitous, occurring in most of the soils and vegetation communities, although varying in levels of dominance, some of these include honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), spiny hackberry (Celtis ehrenbergiana), desert Christmas cholla (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), Texas prickly pear (Opuntia engelmannii var. lindheimeri), and black brush (Vachellia rigidula). Other common trees and shrubs more often found on clay soils include white bush (Aloysia gratissima), goat bush (Castela erecta), brasil (Condalia hookeri), knackaway (Ehretia anacua). Texas lignum- vitae (Guaiacum angustifolium), Texas purple sage (Leucophyllum frutescens), retama (Parkinsonia aculeata), Berlandier acacia (Senegalia berlandieri), and huisache (Vachellia farnesiana var. farnesiana).Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Calcareous Thornscrub (Accessed: 18 August 2020). Grasslands with sparsely scattered trees and shrubs occur on level to gently rolling sites with sandy soils. These are dominated by dense graminoids such as Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus), and many others. Wildflowers include bull-nettle (Cnidoscolus texanus), shrubby blue sage (Salvia ballotiflora), hairy tubetongue (Justicia pilosella), Texas palafoxia (Palafoxia texana), and hairy zexmania (Wedelia texana). Shrub-dominated patches may develop within these grassy sites where tighter, clay soils occur, reaching six meters or higher, often dominated by several of the ubiquitous species noted above. Woodlands occur in places with a well-developed canopy over an understory of grasses. The grasses in these communities contain a layer of taller species such as hooded windmill grass (Chloris cucullata) and four-flower trichloris (Trichloris pluriflora), and a layer of shorter species such as grama (Bouteloua spp.) and curly mesquite grass (Hilaria belangeri). In some places dense stands of Texas prickly pear occur instead of shrubs and grasses. Canopy species include many ubiquitous trees along with huisache (Acacia farnesiana), desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), brasil (Condalia hookeri), Texas hogplum (Colubrina texensis), Colima (Zanthoxylum fagara), and others. Other shrubs include desert yaupon (Schaefferia cuneifolia), desert olive (Forestiera angustifolia), and lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia). Xeric rocky uplands with shallow calcareous soils on caliche and gravel substrates support shrublands one half to two meters high. Species such as cenizo (Leucophyllum frutescens), guajillo (Acacia berlandieri), Texas kidneywood (Eysenhardtia texana), twisted acacia (Vachellia schaffneri), Spanish dagger (Yucca treculeana), and baretta (Helietta parvifolia) and others grow with ubiquitous trees and shrubs. The creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) grows in western areas. The herbaceous layer may be sparse in places where rocky exposures occur. Forbs and wildflowers can be conspicuous in rocky areas, including narrowleaf thryallis (Galphimia angustifolia), peonia (Acourtia runcinata), Gregg’s senna (Chamaecrista greggii), plateau rocktrumpet (Macrosiphonia macrosiphon), and hairy zexmania (Wedelia hispida).Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Mixed Deciduous Thornscrub (Accessed: 18 August 2020). Saline lakes and saline thornscrub occur in some interior, low-lying areas with interior draining basins, created by runoff and evaporation. Lakebeds (often dry) may lack vegetation or have sparse halophytic grasses and forbs like alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), sea ox-eye daisy (Borrichia frutescens), and saltwort (Batis maritima). Surrounding saline thornscrub is semi-open with ubiquitous shrubs under 5 m., growing with species like saladillo (Varilla texana), knifeleaf condalia (Condalia spathulata), Johnston's seaheath (Frankenia johnstonii), and screw bean mesquite (Prosopis reptans) among others. Soils may have a thin layer of gravel over clay with patchy grasses and cacti such as Fitch’s hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus reichenbachii var. fitchii) and horse crippler (Echinocactus texensis).Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Saline Lake (Accessed: 18 August 2020).

Internally drained basins with non-salin, or freshwater also occur on clay lined or clay loam soils that hinder drainage. Sometimes called potholes, lagunas, lagunitas, ponds, or copitas, these are ephemeral wetlands but may remain moist over extended periods of time.Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Closed Depression Wetland (Accessed: 18 August 2020). Montezuma bald cypress (Taxodium mucronatum) Rio Pilón near Villagrán, Tamaulipas, Mexico (9 August 2005). Riparian zones and floodplains can support luxuriant forest on the alluvial soils of the major rivers. These can sometimes have a dense canopy up to 15 meters high. Dominant canopy species may include many of the ubiquitous and common species noted above, as well as granjeno (Celtis ehrenbergiana), sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), Texas ebony (Ebenopsis ebano), anacua (Ehretia anacua), Mexican ash (Fraxinus berlandierana), tepeguaje (Leucaena pulverulenta), and cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia). Riverbanks may have a reduced over-story with black mimosa (Mimosa asperata), black willow (Salix nigra), and giant reed (Arundo donax) an invasive species. Numerous species of vines and epiphytes like Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides) are frequently encountered as well as rarer Bailey's ballmoss (Tillandsia baileyi). The herbaceous layer is often not well developed. In the Nueces River drainage and northward, pecan (Carya illinoinensis) and plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis) may be common. Diversity increases southward and the Rio Grande Delta has a denser understory with a sub-canopy layer at 4 to 5 meters including Sierra Madre torchwood (Amyris madrensis), Texas torchwood (Amyris texana), Barbados cherry (Malpighia glabra), catclaw acacia (Senegalia wrightii), brushholly (Xylosma flexuosa), and others. Monumental Montezuma cypresses (Taxodium mucronatum) once lined portions of the Rio Grande and other southern rivers, but few remain today. Parque Nacional El Sabinal in the town of Ciudad Cerraivo, Nuevo Leon preserves some fine examples of old Montezuma cypress in an urban environment.Gobierno El México, Parque Nacional El Sabinal Only a few, small groves of Mexican sabal palm (Sabal mexicana) remain on the Rio Grande Delta, but it is believed they once occurred as far as 120 km. inland. Palms may dominate the canopy or share dominance with other floodplain species reaching 15 meters. The herbaceous layer may include bunch cutgrass (Leersia monandra), tropical sage (Salvia coccinea), and blue boneset (Tamaulipa azurea), or dead palm fronds may restrict the development of the ground layer.Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Floodplain (Accessed: 18 August 2020).Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Rio Grande Delta Thorn Woodland and Shrubland (Accessed: 18 August 2020).Texas Parks and Wildlife (& Nature Serve Explorer), Ecological Mapping Systems of Texas: Tamaulipan Palm Grove Riparian Forest (Accessed: 18 August 2020). Texas Prickly Pear (Opuntia engelmannii var. lindheimeri), State Highway 4, Cameron County, Texas, USA (11 April 2016) Cacti: This region is rich in cacti diversity. In addition to wide ranging species like lace cactus (Echinocactus reichenbachii), and horse-crippler cactus (Echinocactus texensis), other species found in the province include: root cactus (Sclerocactus [=Acanthocereus] scheeri), triangle or barbed wire cactus (Acanthocereus tetragonus), star cactus (Astrophytum asterias), Runyon's beehive cactus (Coryphantha macromeris var. runyonii), Berlandier's hedgehog (Echinocereus berlandieri), pitaya (Echinocereus enneacanthus var. brevispinus), Allicoche hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus papillosus), ladyfinger hedgehog (Echinocereus pentalophus), Dahlia cactus (Echinocereus poselgeri), Junior Tom Thumb cactus (Escobaria emskoetteraana), Turk's head barrel cactus (Ferocactus hamatacanthus var. sinuatus), peyote (Lophophora williamsii), Heyder's pincushion cactus (Mammillaria heyderi), hair-covered cactus or Texas pincushion (Mammillaria prolifera var. texana), pale mammillaria (Mammillaria sphaerica), twisted rib cactus (Thelocactus setispinus) and several others.Loflin, Brian and Shirley Loflin. (2009). Texas Cacti. Texas A&M; University Press, College Station. xv, 291. Some of these species have very limited distributions and are endemic to the region such as Astrophytum caput- medusae from Nuevo Leon, Mexico.Hernández, Héctor M. and Carlos Gómez- Hinostrosa. 2011. Mapping the Cacti of Mexico, Their geographical distribution and based on referenced records. DH Books, Milborne Port, England with CONABIO, Succulent Plant Research, Vol. 7: 128 pp. Fauna Mammals: This region once hosted an impressive number of carnivores but, most were very rare, or entirely extirpated by the early to mid 20th century. The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is extirpated and black bears (Ursus americanus) are now largely restricted to the Sierra de Picachos in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. The most recent records of the jaguar (Panthera onca) in Texas, USA are from the early 1950s, but the species still lingers, although at risk of extinction in Mexico. Similarly, jaguarondi (Herpailurus yaguarondi), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and margay (Leopardus wiedii) are all threatened or endangered in the USA and Mexico. Some puma or mountain lion (Puma concolor), White-nosed coati (Nasua narica), and American Badger (Taxidea taxus) populations still persist, apparently in stable numbers in some remote areas, although the latter is considered a threatened species in Mexico. A few other species such as the Northern Raccoon (Procyon lotor), Coyote (Canis latrans), and to a lesser extent Bobcats (Lynx rufus) have adapted to human encroachment and development.Schmidly, D. J. (2004). The Mammals of Texas. [Sixth Edition]. University of Texas Press, Austin, Texas. xviii, 501 pp. Ceballos, G. Ed. (2014). Mammals of Mexico. Johns Hopkins University Press. Baltimore, Maryland. xiii, 957 pp. Other mammals found in the region include the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), Mexican long-tongued bat (Choeronycteris mexicana), and the southern yellow bat (Lasiurus ega). Rodents include the predatory northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), the Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus), Rio Grande ground squirrel (Ictidomys parvidens) and others such as Coue's rice rat (Oryzomys couesi), southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), Mexican spiny pocket mouse (Liomys irroratus), and Merriam's pocket mouse (Perognathus merriami).

Reptiles: The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and the red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) occur in the north of this region and the Morelet’s crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) and Mesoamerican slider (Trachemys venusta) in the south. Other turtles such as the Mexican box turtle (Terrapene mexicana), Rio Grande cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi), spiny softshell (Apalone spinifera), and the yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon flavescens) occur there. The geographic distribution of the Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandieri) nearly matches that of the Tamaulipan mezquital ecoregion. The Laredo striped whiptail (Aspidoscelis laredoensis) is a species complex of all female lizards that reproduce by parthenogenesis that is endemic to this region. The reticulate collared lizard (Crotaphytus reticulatus) is also endemic. Other representative lizards include the Texas banded gecko (Coleonyx brevis), four-lined skink (Plestiodon tetragrammus), common spotted whiptail (Aspidoscelis gularis), keeled earless lizard (Holbrookia propinqua), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), blue spiny lizard (Sceloporus cyanogenys), and the northern rose-belly lizard (Sceloporus variabilis marmoratus), regarded by some as a full species (Sceloporus marmoratus). Some representative snakes of the Tamaulipan mezquital include the Tamaulipan hook- nose snake (Ficimia streckeri), Mexican milksnake (Lampropeltis annulata), and Schott’s whipsnake (Masticophis schotti). More wide ranging species include the Great Plains ratsnake (Pantherophis emoryi), gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer), long-nose snake (Rhinocheilus lecontei), and eastern patch-nose snake (Salvadora grahamiae). Some tropical species reaching the northern margin of their ranges including the regal black-striped snake (Coniophanes imperialis), Central American indigo snake (Drymarchon melanurus), speckled racer (Drymobius margaritiferus), northern cat-eyed Snake (Leptodeira septentrionalis). Venoumous snakes include the Texas coralsnake (Micrurus tener) and western diamond-back rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), with the western massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus tergeminus) occurring in the north and the Totonacan rattlesnake (Crotalus totonacus) occurring in the south.Lemos Espinal, J.

Amphibians: In spite of the semi-arid environment, enough wetlands are present to support salamanders such as the black-spotted newt (Notophthalmus meridionalis) and the lesser siren (Siren intermedia). A second species of siren is known to occur in the lower Rio Grande, thought to be a distant and isolated population of the greater siren (Siren lacertina) by some, or an undescribed species by others. The Rio Grande leopard frog (Lithobates berlandieri) and western narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) occur in the region along with several toads (Bufonidae) inhabiting the thorn scrub and grasslands including the green toad (Anaxyrus debilis), Texas toad (Anaxyrus speciosus), Gulf Coast toad (Incilius nebulifer), and cane toad (Rhinella horribilis). Many tropical species reach the northern limits of their distributions there such as the Mexican treefrog (Smilisca baudinii), white-lipped frog (Leptodactylus fragilis), sheep frog (Hypopachus variolosus), and the unusual burrowing toad (Rhinophrynus dorsalis), so unique it is classified in a family (Rhinophrynidae) by itself.

Fishes: Two species, the San Ignacio pupfish (Cyprinodon bobmilleri) from the upper Rio San Fernando basin near Linares and the swordtail platyfish (Xiphophourus xiphidium) occurring in the upper parts of the Rio Soto La Maria, in Tamaulipas are endemic to this region. The Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), is a unisexual (all female) species that reproduces through gynogenesis, a form of a form of parthenogenesis. Other fishes found in the area are alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula), longnose gar (Lepisosteus osseus), Rio Grande cichlid (Herichthys cyanoguttatus), sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna), Rio Grande silvery minnow (Hybognathus amarus), San Juan minnow (Dionda couchi), Tamaulipas shiner (Notropis braytoni), Rio Grande shinner (Notropis jemezanus), Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis), and Rio Grande darter (Etheostoma grahami). Two endemic species from this region, the phantom shinner (Notropis orca) and the Salado shinner (Notropis saladonis), are believed to be extinct.García de León, Francisco J., Delladira Gutiérrez Tirado, Dean A.

The state of Texas administers the following lands in the Lower Rio Grande Valley: Lake Casa Blanca International State Park (525-acres); Falcon State Park (576 acres); Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park (764 acres); Estero Llano Grande State Park (230 acres); Resaca de la Palma State Park (1,200 acres); and the Las Palomas Wildlife Management Area comprised 18 units with tracts ranging from two to 604 acres (3,311 acres total).Texas Parks and Wildlife: Las Palomas WMA, Lower Rio Grande Valley Units The U. S. Federal Government also administers lands in the Lower Rio Grande Valley including the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge (2,088 acres) and western and higher elevation areas of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge on the Gulf Coast (>97, 000 acres). The multi-unit Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge has nearly 40,000 acres open to the public [e.g. the Boca Chica tract (10,680-acres), East Lake unit (1,700 acres), La Puerta unit (4,000 acres), Teniente Lake unit (5,600 acres), Yturria Brush unit (1,800 acres)] and an additional 6,000 acres open to hunting [as of 2020].U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, Texas Also of note is the Sabal Palm Sanctuary (557-acres), cooperatively manage by the Gorgas Science Foundation and the National Audubon Society, preserving some of the finest old growth riparian zones and sabal palm groves (Sabal mexicana) remaining. Beyond the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas protected lands include the Chaparral Wildlife Management Area (15,200 acres), Lake Corpus Christi State Park (356 acres), and Choke Canyon State Park: including the Calliham unit (1,100 acres), the South Shore unit (385-acres), and the adjoining James E.

Early life Draper was born in Hopedale, Massachusetts on December 24, 1912. His father was Clare H. Draper, son of General William Franklin Draper, who served in the Civil War and later as Ambassador to Italy. Draper's mother was Mathilda Engman Draper, who was from Kentucky. The family owned the Draper Corporation once among the nation's largest manufacturer of textile looms and related machines. Draper's father was on a fishing trip in Nova Scotia when the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hit, and was unable to sell stock in the company causing a significant financial loss during Draper's teenage years. As a child, Draper's was a child prodigy on the piano. He attended the Pomfret School in Connecticut and then Harvard University in 1930 to study concert piano. He subsequently changed his focus to painting and spent time in Provincetown, Massachusetts, studying with Charles Webster Hawthorne and Henry Hensche. Draper attended the National Academy of Design in New York, and the Cape Cod School of Art in Massachusetts. Following his education, he went to Spain to study briefly with Harry Zimmerman (protege of Paul Sacks), and then moved to France, where he attended the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. In 1937, he studied sculpture with George Demetrius, a Boston sculptor, and Jon Corbino in Rockport. Career as a combat artist in World War II In 1942, Draper entered the Naval Reserves as a lieutenant (junior grade). After his initial training, Draper was assigned to the Anti-submarine warfare Unit in Boston. Following his service in Boston, he transferred into the Naval Art Section, to be an American official war artists, and was dispatched to Alaska, where he spent nearly half a year painting in the Aleutian Islands. He spent time on Amchitka and several of his paintings depict the attacks by the Japanese, as seen from his close-range foxhole. Draper painted while dealing with the wind and Arctic weather, which made painting difficult, as he had to wear gloves to keep from getting frostbite. After Draper returned from Alaska, he was requested as the artist for the portrait of Rear Admiral J.R. Beardall, then Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. Following the completion of the portrait, he was specifically ordered to paint Admiral Nimitz in Pearl Harbor and Admiral Halsey in Newmire, among others. After the Bougainville Campaign, Draper was assigned to the USS Yorktown (CV-10), and while on duty, painted the series of air attacks on Palau, the landings at Hollandia, and the airstrikes on Truk island. Draper also covered invasions of Saipan and Guam aboard the USS Tennessee (BB-43). During his tour on the Tennessee, the ship was hit three times by enemy fire, and they were forced to land at Guam. On returning to the U.S. after the war, Draper married Barbara Natalia Cagiati in Washington, DC., where he completed three murals commissioned for the Naval Academy in Bancroft Hall. Draper was awarded the Bronze Star for his Naval services, and left the Navy in 1945 as a Lieutenant Commander. Professional career as an artist After his military service, Draper started a family and moved from Washington to New York City, in a house that belonged to sculptor Daniel Chester French. The Metropolitan Museum of Art had a combat artists show, and there was one entitled, \\"Men At War,\\" in Washington, both of which helped Draper's work to become known. Then in 1949, he obtained his Park Avenue studio in NYC, and began his portraiture career in earnest. For approximately fifty years, captains of industry, University deans, heads of state, luminaries and historical figures from many walks of life had their portraits painted in Draper's Park Avenue studio - often completed in five days, 2 sittings a day. His commissioned works ranged from Richard M. Nixon, (1981), John Foster Dulles, the Shah of Iran (painted in 1967), James Michener (1979), Dr. Charles Mayo for the Mayo Clinic, Walter H. Annenberg, Mrs. Dorothy Chandler, Terence Cardinal Cooke, Henry Kaiser, and Dr. Richard E. Winter (1992). Draper was the only artist to paint John F. Kennedy from life. In 1962, Draper flew to Palm Beach, FL, where Kennedy sat for a sketch, which Draper used as a reference for several other commissioned portraits of Kennedy, among them the Harvard University and the National Portrait Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution. Throughout his career, Draper always painted landscapes due to his great interest in nature. He showed at Knoedler, the Graham Gallery, Portraits, Inc., the Far Gallery, The Findlay Galleries (New York, NY) and the Robert C. Vose Galleries (Boston, MA). His work has been included in shows at the National Portrait Gallery and the Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), The National Academy of Design (New York, NY), The Boston Museum of Fine Arts, (Boston, MA) the Fogg Art Museum, (one of the Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, MA), the National Gallery, (London), Salon de la Marine (Paris) and in museums in Australia. For many years, he enjoyed teaching at the Art Students League of New York. In 1999, Draper received a lifetime achievement award from the Portrait Society of America. Draper died on October 26, 2003 at the age of 90.

As the industry becomes more mature, and the number of manufacturers increases, the line between the broad descriptions becomes less defined. Digital Printers are sometimes erroneously referred to as being “Digital Printing Presses”. The term Printing Press refers to the nature of the process, in which there is contact between the system that applies the ink to the substrate and substrate that the ink is pressed onto. Digital Printers however are non-impact printing processes; to print, a devices “fires” drops of ink from the print heads onto the substrate. Categories Here is a broad outline of classes of digital printers in the graphic arts segment of the printing industry. =High volume= These systems print at speeds measured at between 200 and 400 square metres per hour. =Super wide format= These printers are generally roll-to-roll and have a print bed that is 2m to 5m wide. Mostly used for printing billboards and generally have the capability of printing between 60 and 160 square metres per hour. Traditionally these were manufactured by Western manufacturers, however in the last 5 to 10 years Korean, Japanese and Chinese printer manufacturers have been aggressively competing in this category with more reliable faster printers. Margins dictate that many well-known European brands are currently manufactured in the East and simply rebranded in Europe and the United States for distribution around the world. Market antipathy to products manufactured in the East is becoming obsolescent as the vast majority of products used commercially are either assembled complete in the East or have their parts manufactured and exported from there. The low manufacturing costs of parts and machines in the East would make it extremely difficult for super-wide format digital printer suppliers around the world to compete profitably unless they turned to countries like China, Korea and Japan for their manufacturing. =Wide format= These printers are most commonly manufactured in Korea and China with India starting to develop printers as well. These machines are now available from 0.9 metres to 3 metres wide. Generally they are capable of printing from 10 to 60 square metres per hour. =High resolution= Printers are generally referred to as \\"Super-Wide format\\" when their print bed exceeds 2.2m in width. For many applications at this size resolution becomes secondary to print speed - which is why many machines over 3m wide are designed for speed over resolution. In the 1980s billboards were generally printed at resolutions as low as 80dpi (dots per inch). Resolutions today are much higher because of the improvements in technology but printing billboards, vehicle graphics, building wraps and the like do not require the ultra-high resolutions of 1440dpi and upwards often associated with standard wide format printers. It is normal for super-wide format digital printers to function at maximum resolutions of between 540dpi and around 1040dpi. However even these resolutions are rarely used in a production environment, billboards and building wraps for example are often done at between 200dpi and 350dpi and the end result relies on the viewing distance for the impactful, colourful graphics the public sees on roadsides and buildings. The fact that they are capable of printing at these higher resolutions is still important though because it attests to the size of the ink droplet being laid down by the inkjet solvent and eco-solvent machines. These ink droplets are measured in pica-litres and a print done at 200dpi will look more defined if it is printed with smaller ink droplets when compared to a machine laying down bigger ink droplets. The primary print head technologies used in ultra-wide format digital outdoor printing comes down to a few print head manufacturers worldwide including (but not restricted to) Piezo, Seiko and Spectra as the primary competitors and their print heads are used in most machines from a variety of manufacturers. They have their pros and cons and Piezo appears to focus more on the higher resolution side of the industry whereas Seiko and Spectra-Polaris tend more towards the robust, high production capabilities required in a manufacturing environment. Print heads At this time these printers use printers using PZT crystals as micro-pumps to eject the droplets from the nozzles. The crystals deform to generate a “shock wave” in the fluid inks which in turn ejects a drop from the nozzle. A combination of surface tension, capillary pressure and other complex fluid dynamics ensures that the fluid is refilled ready for the next fire cycle.

Career DiMuro was born in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Henry Snyder High School in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he played football,American League Red Book (1975), p. 78. and then Jersey City Junior College. He served in the Air Force in West Germany, but a broken finger in the service ended his baseball playing career and he turned to umpiring, graduating from the Al Somers School and working in the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League (1955), Northern League (1956), Eastern League (1957) and International League (1958–62).The American League Red Book (1963), p. 50. He joined the AL staff and immediately worked a full schedule as a rookie in 1963. He was selected to work the World Series in 1969 and 1976, the All-Star Game in 1965, 1967, 1972 and 1981, and the American League Championship Series in 1971, 1975 and 1978, serving as crew chief in 1978. =1969 World Series= In Game 5 of the 1969 World Series, the New York Mets held a 3 games to 1 lead over the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles, and were looking to close the series at home in front of a raucous crowd at Shea Stadium. The Orioles, behind the pitching of ace Dave McNally, led 3–0 in the bottom of the sixth inning when a pitch from McNally was low and inside to Mets leadoff hitter Cleon Jones. DiMuro, the home plate umpire, called the pitch a ball, but New York manager Gil Hodges appealed the ruling, believing the pitch hit Jones. Hodges showed the ball to DiMuro, and pointed out a speck of black shoe polish to DiMuro. DiMuro accepted Hodges' explanation, and awarded Jones first base. Baltimore manager Earl Weaver, who had been ejected from Game 4 by umpire Shag Crawford for arguing balls and strikes, immediately came out and vehemently protested DiMuro's decision, to no avail. (Earlier in the same game, Baltimore's Frank Robinson had been hit by a pitch on his hip, but DiMuro ruled that the ball hat hit Robinson's bat and did not award him first base.) Donn Clendenon followed Jones by launching a two-run home run into the Baltimore bullpen in left field, pulling the Mets to within 3–2. The Mets tied the game in the seventh on a leadoff home run by light-hitting shortstop Al Weis, and scored two runs in the eighth with the help of two Baltimore errors. Jones caught a fly ball from Davey Johnson for the game's final out and a 5–3 New York victory, setting off a wild celebration. Notably, DiMuro had been behind the plate barely two months earlier on August 13, 1969, when the Orioles' Jim Palmer pitched an 8–0 no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. =Collision with Cliff Johnson= On May 30, 1979, in the 11th inning of a game in Milwaukee, DiMuro was involved in a major collision near home plate with baserunner Cliff Johnson. https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/31/archives/umpire-dimuro-hurt-in-collision- at-plate-umpire-is-hospitalized.htmlThe crash rendered DiMuro semiconscious and left him with an ailing hip for the remainder of his career. DiMuro missed the remainder of the season. He then slipped on dugout steps shortly after his return in 1980. Fellow crew member Larry Barnett would later remark, \\"He was one of the most decent human beings you'd ever meet, but he always seemed to have bad luck. If someone's bag would get lost, it would be his; if someone came down with the flu bug, it would be him.\\" =Outside chest protector= At the time of his death, DiMuro was one of only nine umpires still using the outside chest protector which had been favored for many decades by AL umpires long after National League arbiters had switched to the inside protector, introduced by Baseball Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem in the dead-ball era. Of the other outside-protector holdovers, Bill Haller retired after working the 1982 World Series, Marty Springstead switched to the inside protector after the season, Dale Ford switched back to the inside protector after the 1983 season (he had used the inside protector in 1981), and George Maloney and Russ Goetz retired after that season. Terry Cooney switched in 1984. Bill Kunkel died of cancer in May 1985 leaving Jerry Neudecker as the last one, and he retired after the 1985 season. The last active umpire who had once used the balloon protector, Joe Brinkman, switched to the inside protector in 1980. Death After a June 6, 1982, game between the Chicago White Sox and Texas Rangers at Arlington Stadium, DiMuro ate dinner with Rangers coach Darrell Johnson. Walking back to his hotel at about 11 PM, he was struck by a car while attempting to cross a busy street. He died about two hours later at Arlington Memorial Hospital of massive head injuries that resulted from striking his head on the car's windshield. No charges were filed against the driver. According to Durwood Merrill, doctors said nothing could have been done to save DiMuro's life. Merrill and crew members Larry Barnett and Mike Reilly were too upset to pack DiMuro's belongings in his hotel room afterward. That task fell to Al Clark, who was part of the incoming crew working the Ranger series against the Seattle Mariners. DiMuro was buried in East Lawn Cemetery in Tucson, Arizona, where he had lived since 1976 after previously residing in Floral Park, New York, and Westfield, New York. Rocky Roe was named to the American League staff as DiMuro's full-time replacement, joining Barnett, Merrill and Reilly for a series in Milwaukee between the Brewers and Baltimore Orioles.  Family  DiMuro's five children included sons Mike and Ray, who also went on to umpire in the major leagues; Mike was a major league umpire from 1999 until his retirement in July 2019; and Ray worked occasionally as a substitute umpire in the AL from 1996 to 1999. Mike began wearing number 16 to honor his father in 2000; the number had previously been retired by AL umpires since Lou's death.

Oliver (February 25, 1840 - February 8, 1904) was an American industrialist. Biography Henry W. Oliver was born in Ireland in 1840. Two years later his family settled in Pittsburgh. Oliver began working at the age of thirteen as a messenger boy for the National Telegraph Company in Pittsburgh. Oliver worked at various jobs until 1861 when he served in the Civil War. In 1863, he formed a partnership with William J. Lewis and John Phillips to create the firm of Lewis, Oliver and Phillips to manufacture nuts and bolts on a small scale. By 1868, two of his brothers joined the firm and in 1880, they formed the firm, Oliver Brothers and Phillips. By this time, the company was one of the largest manufacturers of bar iron and iron specialties in the United States. In 1888, the company incorporated under the name of Oliver Iron and Steel Company. Oliver was involved in working with the Mesabi ore region near Lake Superior in Minnesota, spinning off the Oliver Iron Mining Company from his other interests in a venture with the Carnegie Steel Company. The Lake Superior iron ore industry became the basis for United States Steel. Oliver helped to develop improved processes for steel making, brought about a new and improved design for blast furnaces, and assisted in helping to finance several of Pittsburgh's large steel industries.See generally Evans, Henry Oliver, \\"Iron Pioneer: Henry W. Oliver 1840-1904\\" (1942)(E. P. Dutton & Co.). Much of his energy was devoted to bringing new railroad routes into Pittsburgh (including the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie as well as the South Pennsylvania Railroad) and to providing new terminal belt lines for the city. He also helped to develop the steel freight car (in place of the small wooden cars previously used). Perhaps his most important action, however, was spearhead efforts to \\"slack water\\" the Ohio River so that Pittsburgh had a transportation mode that was reliable year round rather than being dependent on the river's vagaries.Under strong pressure from Pittsburgh businessmen, the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1874 and 1929 placed a system of dams with locks on the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to its junction with the Mississippi River at Cairo, Illinois. Canalization of the Ohio River guaranteed a nine-foot navigation channel year-round, independent of the vagaries of seasonal and meteorological flow fluctuations. With the successful construction of the slackwater system, the Corps accomplished complete and permanent control of the Ohio River. He would become politically active with the Republican Party in Pittsburgh. He married Edith Cassidy in 1862. The Olivers had one daughter. Five years after his death, Oliver's brother George T. Oliver became a United States Senator. References *Oliver Iron and Steel Company, Pittsburgh, Pa.

He spent the best years of his playing career at Coventry City. Although his career was plagued by injury, he managed a decent strike-rate at most of the clubs he played for. Biography Ferguson was discovered by Coventry City's scouting system, broadened under Jimmy Hill's management to be able to identify young talent anywhere in the country. In his first spell at the club he scored 51 goals in 127 league games over a six-year period. In 1977, he was top scorer with 13 league goals, but the following season he and Ian Wallace formed a devastating strike partnership scoring 37 league goals between them; Ferguson's share was 17 from 30 games, including three hat-tricks. Ferguson was a key member of what was Coventry's most exciting top-flight team. Playing alongside Ian Wallace, Bobby McDonald, Tommy Hutchison, Terry Yorath and Graham Oakey Ferguson was often unplayable in the air, while surprisingly skilful for such a tall player on the floor. He is one of 30 players selected for Coventry City's Hall of Fame. During this period he was regularly considered for inclusion into the England international squad, though the call-up never came. After an £750,000 (£500,000 and Martin O'Neill) transfer to Nottingham Forest was cancelled in late 1979 Everton paid £280,000 for him in August 1981, but little more than a year later he moved to Birmingham City, initially on loan. In those months on loan he scored enough goals to be the club's top scorer for the season, but injuries interrupted his career and he played only two more league games for them. He was allowed back to his old club Coventry City on loan in March 1984; the three goals he scored in what remained of that season were enough to save Coventry from relegation from the top flight, ironically at Birmingham's expense. He went on to play for Brighton & Hove Albion, Colchester United and finally non-league Wealdstone. Ferguson retired from playing in 1987, but remained in football, working in community development with several professional clubs. Despite the effects of injury on Ferguson's career, he made more than 200 league appearances (mainly in the top flight), scoring more than 80 league goals.

His debut novel SoMa became a bestseller (San Francisco Chronicle) in the spring of 2007. The novel tells the interwoven stories of twentysomethings on the prowl for thrills in San Francisco’s South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood following the city’s infamous Dot-com crash. In June 2008 the novel SoMa was honored as a finalist for the national Lambda Literary award for debut fiction. At the time SoMa was published, James produced a series of videos for YouTube in which he appeared as Kemble Scott to take viewers to the real places that inspired the novel. It’s believed this was the first time an author launched a novel this way. The videos received thousands of views and may have contributed to the book’s bestseller status. The influential tech blog Valleywag noted the videos, but criticized them for being too tame, compared to the sexually explicit content of the novel. In May 2009 James published his second novel, The Sower by Kemble Scott. The first edition premiered as a digital book and was the first novel sold by social publisher Scribd.com in a new e-commerce venture called \\"Scribd Store,\\" according to the Associated Press . The author's decision to release the first edition of The Sower exclusively as an e-book received widespread media coverage. This led to offers to create a printed version. On August 31, 2009, Numina Press published the first hardcover edition, which instantly hit the San Francisco Chronicles bestsellers list, premiering at #5 for that week. In October 2010, a second digital edition of was released: The Sower 2.0. Debuting exclusively on Scribd, the new version was reimagined by the author and updated with topical references for late 2010. Prior to working in fiction, James was a longtime television news writer, producer and executive. While at WLNE-TV in Providence, Rhode Island, he was honored with three Emmy awards. During his tenure there as news director, the station twice won the News Station of the Year Award from the Associated Press.

As a second- generation Italian American, Barolini often writes on issues of Italian- American identity.How to count American immigrant generations is a subject of dispute. Some begin counting with the immigrants themselves; others begin with the first generation born in the United States. Using the latter method, an American such as Barolini, whose grandparents were natives of Italy and whose parents were born in the United States, would be considered a second- generation Italian American. Among her notable works are Umbertina (1979), a novel which tells the story of four generations of women in one Italian- American family; and an anthology, The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women (1985), which called attention to an emerging, and previously unnoticed, class of writers.  Biography  = Early life and education = Helen Frances Barolini (née Mollica) was born on November 18, 1925, in Syracuse, New York, to Italian-American parents. Her father was a local merchant. Although her grandparents were Italian immigrants, Barolini spoke no Italian until she hired a tutor at Syracuse to teach her the language. She graduated magna cum laude from Syracuse University in 1947, received a diploma di profitto from the University of Florence in 1950, and earned a master's degree in library science from Columbia University in 1959. = Career = After graduating from Syracuse, Barolini traveled to Italy, studying in Perugia and writing articles for the Syracuse Herald-Journal. It was there that she met and married the Italian writer, Antonio Barolini. The couple lived in Italy for several years before moving to New York. She translated several of her husband's works into English, including \\"Our Last Family Countess\\" (1960) and \\"A Long Madness\\" (1964). Assisted by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Barolini completed her first book in 1979: the novel Umbertina, for which she received the Americans of Italian Heritage award for literature in 1984 and the Premio Acerbi, an Italian literary prize, in 2008. The novel is named for her maternal grandmother, who was born in Calabria. Her anthology, The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women (1985), received the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation and the Susan Koppelman Award from the American Culture Association. It was praised by novelists Alice Walker and Cynthia Ozick, and hailed as a major work by critic Jules Chametzky.Barolini (1985), The Dream Book, back cover. In an essay on Italian-American novelists, Fred Gardaphé writes, \\"Until The Dream Book appeared in 1985, Italian American women had not had the critics or literary historians who would attempt to probe their background, unlock the reasons of past silence, and acknowledge that they are finally present.\\" Barolini's essays have appeared in the New Yorker, Ms., the Yale Review, the Paris Review, the Kenyon Review, the Prairie Schooner, and other journals. Her essay collection, Chiaroscuro: Essays of Identity (1997), was named a Notable Work of American Literary Non-Fiction in The Best American Essays of the Century (2000), and her essay, \\"How I Learned to Speak Italian,\\" originally published in the Southwest Review, was included in The Best American Essays 1998. Barolini has been an invited writer at Yaddo (1965) and the MacDowell Colony (1974); writer in residence at the Quarry Farm Center of Elmira College (1989); a Rockefeller Foundation resident scholar at Bellagio Center in Lake Como (1991); and visiting artist at the American Academy in Rome (2001). She has won numerous prizes and grants for her literary work. She has also taught at Trinity College, Kirkland College, and Pace University; served as associate editor for the Westchester Illustrated; and worked as a librarian in Westchester, New York. = Personal life = She married Antonio Barolini in 1950. The couple had three daughters. Teodolinda Barolini became a professor of Italian at Columbia University; Susanna Barolini married an Italian artist from Urbino, and moved to Italy; and Nicoletta Barolini became an art director, also at Columbia.

Establishment  Kokomo was named after the city of Kokomo, Indiana. Kokomo was organized by the Phillip Enoch family of Fernwood, Mississippi, circa 1912. They planned to purchase timber to finance the existing Fernwood railroad that the family was purchasing. After they had secured a right-of- way, the Enochs began to construct and lay the track east of Tylertown. The first tracks were made of wood, but were later replaced with metal. When the tracks crossed a public road, they would give the crossing a name. The names came in the following order: Davo; Barto; Carto; Knoxo; and Kokomo. Kokomo was established approximately to the east of Tylertown.  Commerce  While in Kokomo, the Enochs set up a turpentine distillery, the largest in the United States at that time. There were blacksmith shops, café, barbershop, grocery stores, gristmills, and a drug store.  Education  The first school at Kokomo was the Old China Grove School. This was a one-room, cotton-house-style building that was used from 1904 until 1912 - school terms lasted about six months each year. The logging camp moved in 1912, and so a new school building was erected at the new location in Kokomo. The first Kokomo Baptist Church was used for the school until the new school building could be constructed. In 1935 when the logging camp had moved out of Kokomo and most of the population with it, Kokomo became a small town.  Churches  The Baptist Church was organized on September 12, 1911. The church building was constructed shortly after this time with the lumber being donated by Mack Williamson and Henry Bourne. Joe Morris donated the pews for the church. This church stood just across the road and a few yards south of where the Kokomo United Methodist Church stands today. In 1959, when the Kokomo School closed, the Baptist Church bought the school building. This old school building was used until 2001 for the Kokomo Baptist Church. In 2001 the Baptist Church moved into a newly constructed building at the same location. The Kokomo Methodist Church was organized in 1910. Before being organized they had started worshipping in 1906 under the leadership of J. E. Williamson. Later from 1907 to 1909 W. B. Waldrop led the worshippers. In 1910 the worship leader was T. H. King and in 1911 it was D. Scarborough. Dr. Henry Lewis Carruth was one of the people of Kokomo who met in October 1911 to organize Kokomo Methodist Church. Early settlers of the community included the Jarrell, Simmons, Hansford Rowley & Fred Rowley families, Packwood, Toney, Summers, Lee, Conerly, Foil and Reagan families.

The Short Creek raid was the largest mass arrest of polygamists in American history. At the time, it was described as \\"the largest mass arrest of men and women in modern American history.\\"C.R. Waters, Mohave Miner, 1953-08-30. Events Just before dawn on July 26, 1953, 102 Arizona officers of public safety and soldiers from the Arizona National Guard entered Short Creek. The community--which was composed of approximately 400 Mormon fundamentalists--had been tipped off about the planned raid and were found singing hymns in the schoolhouse while the children played outside. The entire community was taken into custody, with the exception of six individuals who were found not to be fundamentalist Mormons.Ken Driggs, \\"After the Manifesto: Modern Polygamy and Fundamentalist Mormons\\", Journal of Church and State 32:367 (1990).

In the same week that the Korean War Armistice Agreement was signed, the raid achieved notoriety in media across the United States, including articles in Time and Newsweek,\\"People: The Big Raid\\", Newsweek, 1953-08-03, p. 26. with many media outlets describing the raid as \\"odious\\" or \\"un-American.\\"Richard S. Van Wagoner (1989). Mormon Polygamy : A History (2d ed) (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books). One commentator has suggested that commentary on the raid was \\"probably the first time in history that American polygamists had received media coverage that was largely sympathetic.\\"Stephen Eliot Smith, The \\"Mormon Question Revisited : Anti-polygamy Laws and the Free Exercise Clause (LL.M. thesis, Harvard Law School, 2005).

Support from LDS Church One of the few media outlets to applaud the raid was the Salt Lake City-based Deseret News, which was owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).By the 1950s, the LDS Church was opposed to the traditional Mormon practice of plural marriage and excommunicated any of its members that practiced it. The News applauded the action as a needed response to prevent the fundamentalists from becoming \\"a cancer of a sort that is beyond hope of human repair.\\"Deseret News, 1953-07-27. When the paper later editorialized its support for separating children from their polygamist parents, there was a backlash against the paper and the church by a number of Latter-day Saints, including Juanita Brooks, who complained that the church organization was approving of \\"such a basically cruel and wicked thing as the taking of little children from their mother.\\" The Short Creek raid was the last action against polygamous Mormon fundamentalists that has been actively supported by the LDS Church.Gordon B. Hinckley, president of the LDS Church, has stated that the decision whether or not to prosecute a Mormon polygamist is \\"entirely in the hands of the civil officers. It's a civil offence. It's in violation of the law. We have nothing to do with it. We're totally distanced from it. And if the state chooses to move on it, that's a responsibility of civil officers.\\" : Gordon B. Hinckley on Larry King Live, CNN tevevision broadcast, 1998-09-08. Aftermath After the Short Creek raid, the fundamentalist Mormon polygamist colony at Short Creek eventually rejuvenated.Neil J. Young, \\"Short Creek's Long Legacy\\" , Slate, April 16, 2008. Short Creek was renamed Colorado City in 1960. In 1991, the Mormon fundamentalists at Colorado City formally established the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church). The members of the sect did not face any prosecutions for its polygamous behavior until the late 1990s, when isolated individuals began to be prosecuted.\\"The Primer\\" - Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities. A joint report from the offices of the Attorneys General of Arizona and Utah. In 2006, FLDS Church leader Warren Jeffs was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted List; he was arrested in 2007 and in 2011 was convicted in Texas of two counts of child sexual abuse. On 3 April 2008, following allegations of physical and sexual abuse by an unidentified caller who claimed to be a 16-year-old girl, law enforcement officers raided a FLDS compound Jeffs had founded in Texas called the YFZ Ranch. As of 8 April, a total of 416 children had been removed from the compound by authorities. A former member of the FLDS Church, Carolyn Jessop, arrived on-site 6 April and stated her opinion that the action in Texas was unlike the Short Creek raid. Others, however, have drawn direct connections between the two events.

The book outlines a method for analyzing the rhythms of urban spaces and the effects of those rhythms on the inhabitants of those spaces. It builds on his past work, with which he argued space is a production of social practices. The book is considered to be the fourth volume in his series Critique of Everyday Life. Published in 1992 after his death, Rhythmanalysis is the last book Lefebvre wrote. Origins of rhythmanalysis The term \\"rhythmanalysis\\" was coined by Portuguese philosopher Lúcio Alberto Pinheiro dos Santos who published a first theory of rhythmanalysis in 1931, focused on its physiological dimensions. His ideas on rhythmanalysis have been later further developed by Gaston Bachelard in his 1936 book La dialectique de la durée (The Dialectic of Duration).Meyer, Kurt: \\"Rhythms, Streets, Cities\\" in Space, Difference, Everyday Life: Reading Henri Lefebvre, Routledge, 2008Cunha, Rodrigo Sobral: \\"Ritmanálise\\" (in Portuguese), 2012 General concept of rhythm Lefebvre’s concept of rhythm concerns the repetition of a measure at a frequency. He identifies two kinds of rhythms: cyclical rhythms, which involve simple intervals of repetition, and alternating (or linear) rhythms. An example of a cyclical rhythm would be day fading into night, and night brightening into day; a linear rhythm might be the flow of information from a television set. Additionally, rhythms may be nested within each other; for example, the broadcast of the local news at set intervals throughout the day, throughout the week, is an example of a nested rhythm. In a less abstract fashion (or perhaps only abstract in a different fashion), Lefebvre asserts that rhythms exist at the intersection of place, time and the expenditure of energy. Lefebvre posits that the human body is composed of several rhythms; in order to observe rhythms outside of the body, the rhythmanalyst must use her or his own rhythms as a reference to unify the rhythms under analysis. Properly put, the rhythm is the conjunction of the rhythmanalyst and the object of the analysis. The act of rhythmanalysis Rhythms are only perceptible through the traditional five senses; accordingly, it is possible to conceptualize rhythms as being composed of sense triggers (smells, sights, sounds, etc.). Lefebvre cautions against this conceptualization however; he specifically notes that rhythm is not meant to refer always to its more traditional referents, musical and dance rhythm (although it could, so long as the rhythmanalysis concerned either music or dancing). He also cautions against taking the mere repetition of a movement to indicate a rhythm. The object of rhythmanalysis is to access the obscure property of the rhythm called ‘presence.’ The sensory events through which the rhythmanalyst perceives the rhythm are called ‘simulacra,’ or simply ‘the present.’ The need for rhythmanalysis arises out of the propensity of the present to simulate presence. Presence Lefebvre describes presence as the “facts of both nature and culture, at the same time sensible, affective and moral rather than imaginary” (author’s emphasis). (Elden and Moore translation) Rhythmanalysis stresses that presence is of an innately temporal character and can never be represented by any simulacrum of the present (people walking down a street, the sun going down), but can only be grasped through the analysis of rhythms (people walking down a street through time, the sun’s movement through time). Present The present consists of one’s sensory perceptions. Lefebvre frequently warns of “the trap of the present” wherein the present is always trying to pass itself off as presence, the rhythmanalytical truth of a situation. “The trap of the present” relies on false representation. Lefebvre argues that the present engages in a commodification of reality when it successfully passes itself off as presence. Characteristics of rhythms Lefebvre describes four alignments of rhythms. They are: * Arrhythmia, conflict or dissonance between or among two or more rhythms, such as might occur (biologically) in an ill person; * Polyrhythmia, co-existence of two or more rhythms without the conflict or dissonance that suggests arrhythmia; * Eurhythmia, constructive interaction between or among two or more rhythms, such as occurs in healthy creatures; * Isorhythmia, the rarest association between rhythms, implies equivalence of repetition, measure and frequency.

Three weeks later, an estimated 500,000 people joined a two-day general strike, bringing commerce and travel in Puerto Rico to a standstill. Protests and pickets were mostly peaceful, but in the week before the general strike some infrastructure elements were sabotaged, and two bombs were detonated. The strike failed to stop the privatization plan, and in July a consortium led by GTE bought the PRTC for US$1.9 billion. Background At the start of the 20th century, brothers Hernan and Sosthenes Behn founded the Puerto Rico Telephone Company, before moving to New York and incorporating International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) in 1920. ITT ran the PRTC for many years, coordinating telephone service on the island with the government's Interior Department. In the 1940s, the Puerto Rican government enacted a series of laws designed to make telephone access more available in the eastern part of the island and allowed the state to play more of a role in providing service. By the end of 1959, the island had 76,000 phone lines.Cortès, Ramón Morales (n.d.). \\"Telecommunications in Puerto Rico\\". Online at the Virtual Institute of Information. Columbia Institute for Tele- Information. Retrieved on 9 September 2007. Service under the ITT/ID partnership expanded rapidly across the island, but tended to favor wealthier urban areas, while residents of outlying areas experienced long waiting periods and lack of access. ITT often imported outdated equipment from Latin America for use within the PRTC,Gonzalez, Juan (1998). \\"'Puerto Rico had never seen anything like it': The meaning of the general strike\\". The Progressive. 1 September 1998. Online at Highbeam Encyclopedia. Retrieved on 9 September 2007. and the company's salary practices produced criticism: some non-Puerto Ricans were paid almost four times as much as the highest-earning Puerto Rican executive. This was compounded by an October 1973 ruling by the Puerto Rico Public Service Commission, fining the PRTC US$219,000. In 1974, Governor Rafael Hernández Colón oversaw the government purchase of PRTC from ITT for a price of US$168 million. The newly nationalized phone company sought to improve service and expand networks, beginning with a US$500 million modernization fund. By 1980, the island had 12.9 lines per 100 people, up from 8.3 in 1974. By the 1990s, the PRTC was donating US$100 million each year to the government and gave free service to Puerto Rico's public schools. =1990 strike= In February 1990, Governor Hernández Colón – serving his third and final term – proposed the sale of the PRTC to Bell Atlantic (which merged with GTE in 2000 to create Verizon Communications). Hernández Colón suggested that proceeds from the sale would go toward public education and improved infrastructure. Labor unions in Puerto Rico opposed the sale, however, and on 28 March 3,800 telephone workers went on a one-day strike. On the same day, a march 150,000 Puerto Ricans proceeded to the capitol building in San Juan. This activity – in addition to a law requiring a $3 billion sale price and a ban on firings for 18 months – blocked the proposed sale.Luxner, Larry (1998). \\"Pride of the Caribbean: Puerto Rico prepares to sell phone company – again\\".

Some small-scale confrontations were reported on the first day, with one arrest after a worker was accused of spraying police with a mace-like substance. =Violence and sabotage= Clashes between striking workers and police became more violent on 22 June when officers beat a group of strikers unconscious as members of the press watched. In the days after this incident, militant protesters carried out a wave of property destruction and sabotage.

Elsewhere at the end of June, telephone and optic fiber cables were cut, causing service losses to over 300,000 customers and half of the island's ATMs. A telephone switching box in Cayey and a telephone booth in Mayagüez were also set on fire. As the workers' strike dragged on with no response from the government, a coalition called the Greater Committee of Labor Organizations (Comite Amplio de Organizaciones Sindicales, or CAOS) was formed with the goal of launching a general strike.  New York Health Care Workers Union  Local 1199 NY UIET representative Victor Rodriguez met on July 9 in New York with members of the health care workers union, Local 1199.

The entrance to the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport =Travel disruptions= Traffic to the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport was brought to a halt by the strike when activists erected barricades on the road leading to the terminal. This resulted in a tense five-hour standoff between 200 riot policemen and twice as many protesters, some of them armed with baseball bats and chains.Ruiz, Carmelo (1998). \\"Puerto Rico Revolts against Privatization\\".

An agreement was eventually reached between protesters and police which allowed for the opening of two lanes of traffic. Still, movement was limited due to striking bus and taxi drivers. Two cruise ships also canceled stops in Puerto Rico because of the strike. End of strike On 28 July, union telephone workers voted to end their 41-day strike, after receiving assurances that there would be no reprisals for striking workers. Given the popular support of the strike and the island's history with PRTC, some were puzzled by leaders' willingness to call off the protest. Writing in the Green journal Synthesis/Regeneration, Carmelo Ruiz asks: \\"What happened? The speed with which the national struggle against the PRTC's sale and governor Rossello's privatization policy fell apart points to an inside job.

It is a piece of amatory fiction. Some of the story's main themes include woman's desire, guilt, and reputation. A specific example of certain themes are shown throughout the novella as Isabella's desire to uphold society's expectations of being a virtuous woman, her love for Henualt after breaking her vows, but also for her desire to get away with murder and to maintain her reputation. The book, and Aphra Behn as a female writer, inspired many other writers to use amatory fiction as a way to write about women. It contains an introduction which may suggest a romantic affair between the author and Hortense Mancini, niece of Cardinal Mazarin, one of the mistresses of Charles II and \\"adventuresses\\" of the 17th century.  Plot  The main character, Isabella, is the daughter of Count Henrick de Vallary of Iper (Ypres). After the count's wife dies, he sends his daughter to a nunnery run by her Reverend aunt, Lady Abbess, but with the provision that she will decide for herself whether she wants to become a nun when she turns thirteen. Despite the success of her debut, aided by her genius, piety, and beauty, Isabella turns down the lavish lifestyle she could have as the wife of a wealthy man for the life of a nun. However, she had won many suitors during her short debut, and one, in particular, is eighteen-year-old Villenoy. He alone of all her admirers possessed the courage to confess his feelings, but when she turns him down, he falls deathly ill. Though he does recover, his feelings remain as he heads off to war. A nun named Sister Katteriena arrives at the nunnery. She is Isabella's bed-companion and closest friend. She has a brother named Arnaldo Henault, who loves his sister dearly and comes to visit her almost every day at the nunnery gate. Isabella comes along with Katteriena and, after some time, falls in love with him. She makes the decision to flee the nunnery with him, thereby breaking her vows. As she flees, she also steals from the nunnery. As a result, Henault's father disowns him. They both secure pardons through the aid of Isabella's aunt, but they struggle on their own in the country, failing at farming and living in poverty. In order to win the favor of his father, Henault joins the army, where he meets Villenoy. After a particularly disastrous military loss Henault is presumed dead. As Villenoy returns to console his widow, he also seizes this as an opportunity to win the hand of Isabella, whom he still loves exceedingly. Impoverished, deprived of her husband, and unwilling to return to the nunnery, Isabella agrees to marry Villenoy, but asks him to wait three years before they marry so she may grieve for Henault. After the three years, they marry and Isabella lives the lavish lifestyle her father first told her she could have when she made her debut. Seven years later, Henault escapes his enslavement and returns home to Isabella. He explains what happened to him, and she confesses that she has married Villenoy. She then offers him a bed in which to sleep but later suffocates him with a pillow while he sleeps, fearing that she will be shamed for having committed bigamy. Sometime after her crime, Villenoy, who was out visiting a friend returns home. She tells him that Henault has returned but lies about her crime, saying that Henault merely died of grief after discovering that she has remarried. Villenoy decides to throw Henault's body into the river and proclaims that he will do it himself, for love of her. However, to save herself from future reproach from him, Isabella sews the canvas bag into which the body was placed to Villenoy's collar so that he will be dragged along with the body when he throws it into the water. Her plot works, and two bodies wash up on shore some days later. Authorities identify them as Villenoy and some unknown stranger. When they bring Villenoy's corpse to Isabella, its eyes mysteriously open, and she faints. However, due to her reputation for piety, no one suspects her. The whole thing might have remained a secret had not for the arrival of a French gentleman, who knew Henault from the war and identifies his corpse. Upon this new discovery, authorities question Isabella, who confesses immediately. She is executed, but before she dies she gives an empowered speech about the importance of keeping one's vows, thus conquering everyone's hearts with her beauty and wisdom to the very end.  Characters  Narrator: Showcases views, allowing the reader to have more of an insight on how the narrator may feel about a situation or a character. Isabella: Main character who is seen throughout the novella as a lady of virtue. After her mother's death she goes to a nunnery where eventually her vow is broken due to the love of a man. Henault: Katteriena's brother who wins Isabella's heart, breaking her vows, and becomes her first husband. Villenoy: Isabella's first admirer and best friend of Henault; he eventually becomes Isabella's second husband after the presumed death of Henault. Sister Katteriena: Isabella's best friend and roommate in the nunnery, also sister to Henault. Henrick de Vallary: Isabella's father Lady Abbess: Aunt of Isabella, who had a hand in her becoming a nun. She is also largely concerned about social demands of that century, specifically with Isabella's title. French Gentleman: Fellow slave who escaped with Henault, who was able to connect the dots to the mysterious murder so that Isabella was able to be condemned to be beheaded.  Themes  * Woman's desire ** Isabella's desire for Henault causes her to break her vows that the nunnery entails, so that she can be with him * Virtue ** Isabella constantly questions her own morals and what is \\"most evil\\" as in sin, and what is not a sin * Betrayal ** Isabella killing her first and second husband * Social demands ** By Isabella questioning her vows she shows her need for maintaining her appearance in society  Wider context  The History of the Nun belongs to the genre of amatory fiction. Amatory fiction is mainly written by women and has a focus on sexual love and romance, as well as the story as a whole being a little more dramatic rather than realistic. Common themes in amatory fiction include female-centered stories, gender inversion,and the use of masquerade or disguises. Amatory fiction also explores issues of power, social convention, behavior reputation and gender identity. The book Representing Women and Female Desire from Arcadia to Jane Eyre says that the genre of \\"amatory\\" in the 17th century allowed for women writers to not only write about romance, but also \\"through narrative and fictional characters\\" to enter public discourse. Prior to the creation of the genre many works by women were circulated through manuscript.  Reception  The History of the Nun was popular with contemporary audiences, and it was adapted at least five times between 1694 and 1757. The three best-known adaptations are The Fatal Marriage: or, the Innocent Adultery, by Thomas Southerne (1694); Isabella, or, the Fatal Marriage, by David Garrick (1757); and 'Philinda's Story out of the Book' in The Lining of the Patch-Work Screen, by Jane Barker (1726). The History of the Nun, or The Fair Vow Breaker, is a piece whose title speaks for itself, but why a nun? Some critical reviewers such as Susan Goulding argue that Behn's use of nuns also serves as a gateway into the \\"history of feminist thought.\\" Many critics look deep into the sub context of Behn's use of nun. Although Isabella murders both her husbands, the narrator suggests that this would have all been avoided had Isabella not been led by others to make a monastic vow when she was still too young to understand its implications. Elizabeth Matthews calls Isabella 'a vulnerable body caught in the trap of her life', and suggests that Behn predominantly depicted her as an agonized victim who tries but fails to escape her dark fate. Behn, as a 17th-century woman writer, in today's modern world is analyzed rather than ridiculed for her writing. During that time period, women's writing was not dignified, nor was it often acknowledged. Although she was well known for her groundbreaking career, the Restoration circle she was part of mostly preferably allowed license to male writers. The Restoration circle expected women to stay silent and not express their own desire. Her works expressed her need and desire for freedom. The genre of amatory fiction that Behn writes in allows for women of her century to write and read about love and desire through a public narrative. The Fair Jilt is another example of Behn's work that is comparable and somewhat continues the style and themes of her work through another story.

His father, Louis- Oscar Frossardan, was one of the founders of the French Communist Party and served as its first Secretary-General. Later he held a series of ministerial positions in the Government of the Popular Front. Frossard's paternal grandmother was Jewish, and his home village in Foussemagne, France was the only village in France with a synagogue but no church. After attending the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs to complete his education, Frossard began a career in journalism as a cartoonist and columnist. Conversion to Roman Catholicism Raised as an atheist, at the age of 20 Frossard converted to Catholicism and was baptized in the chapel of the Sisters of Adoration on 8 July 1935. He explained his conversion in the title of his 1969 bestseller Dieu existe, je l'ai rencontré (God Exists, I Met Him). French Resistance Frossard joined the French Navy in September 1936 and entered into the French Resistance upon demobilization. He was arrested by the Gestapo in Lyon on 10 December 1943. He was interned in the \\"Jew Shed\\" of Fort Montluc and was one of seven survivors of a massacre in Bron on 2 August 1944, in which 72 were killed. He was awarded the Legion of Honor and promoted to the rank of officer by General Charles de Gaulle. After World War II After the war, Frossard worked at L'Aurore before joining Figaro and Le Monde. He attended many conferences in France and abroad, mainly in Italy, where the city of Ravenna elected him an honorary citizen in 1986. Frossard was elected to the Académie française Seat 2 to the chair of the René de La Croix de Castries on 18 June 1987, and was received into the institution on 10 March 1988 by Catholic Father Ambroise-Marie Carré. By 1990, Frossard had written about 15,000 newspaper articles and several books, mostly regarding religion. In 1990, Pope John Paul II awarded him the Grand Cross of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Death Frossard died in Versailles on 2 February 1995 and is buried in the cemetery of Caluire-et-Cuire.

History He was born Zheng Yaohuang in Xin'an County, Guangdong, Qing China (modern Shenzhen and Hong Kong) in 1760. He was the seventh son of his pirate father Zheng Lianfu (鄭連福) and his wife Lin Xiu (林秀), hence the nickname Zheng Qi. Zheng Qi was recruited by Tay Son dynasty in 1788, and later became one of the most important subordinates under Chen Tianbao. From 1788 to 1799, Zheng frequently attacked southern coast of Qing China together with Mo Guanfu, Liang Wengeng (梁文庚) and Fan Wencai (樊文才). The Qing navy was very afraid of them. In 1795, Zhang Qi abducted a 12-year-old boy named He Song (何送) and raised him as his adopted son. Few years later, Zhang Qi gave him a captive female as his bride and seven hundred of silver (liang) to set up store for the pirate trade. He would later bestowed three ships under He Song's command. Tay Son army was defeated by his rival Nguyen lord in 1801 and, his three comrades Mo Guanfu, Liang Wengeng and Fan Wencai were captured. Zheng Qi came back to his base area in Quảng Ninh, and didn't want to get involved in the civil war. But later he was persuaded by Chen Tianbao, heading his troops to Thăng Long (mordern Hanoi) to aid the king. He was appointed as the Grand Marshal (Vietnamese: Đại Tư Mã, Han tu: 大司馬) by Nguyễn Quang Toản. Death Zheng Qi got involved in the siege of Đồng Hới, and his fleet was defeated in the mouth of Nhật Lệ River by the famous general Nguyễn Văn Trương, he had to flee back to his base area. On September 1802, he was captured and executed by Nguyen dynasty. His army descended into chaos after his death, and later, his cousin Zheng Yi succeeded him as the chief.

She was commissioned into service that same month and was assigned to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet in which she served through the end of World War I and until 1919. The squadron was generally tasked with screening the battleships of the Grand Fleet during the war. The ship did not participate in the inconclusive Action of 19 August 1916 with the rest of her squadron. The squadron was briefly detached from the Grand Fleet in March 1917 to fruitlessly patrol off the Norwegian coast when news of a blockade runner was received by the Admiralty.Newbolt, IV, p. 34, 192 At the beginning of 1919, Cambrian was refitted in Rosyth before she sailed for Devonport where she was visited by the Edward, Prince of Wales on 13 June.

Depression is generally thought of as dysfunction, but it is much more common than schizophrenia, and its prevalence does not increase with age the way dementia and other organic dysfunction commonly does. Some researchers have surmised that the disorder may have evolutionary roots, in the same way that others suggest evolutionary contributions to schizophrenia, sickle cell anemia, psychopathy and other disorders. Psychology and psychiatry have not generally embraced evolutionary explanations for behaviors, and the proposed explanations for the evolution of depression remain controversial.  Background  Major depression (also called \\"major depressive disorder\\", \\"clinical depression\\" or often simply \\"depression\\") is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and in 2000 was the fourth leading contributor to the global burden of disease (measured in DALYs); it is also an important risk factor for suicide. It is understandable, then, that clinical depression is thought to be a pathology—a major dysfunction of the brain. In most cases, rates of organ dysfunction increase with age, with low rates in adolescents and young adults, and the highest rates in the elderly. These patterns are consistent with evolutionary theories of aging which posit that selection against dysfunctional traits decreases with age (because there is a decreasing probability of surviving to later ages). In contrast to these patterns, prevalence of clinical depression is high in all age categories, including otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults. In one study of the US population, for example, the 12 month prevalence for a major depression episode was highest in the youngest age category (15- to 24-year-olds). The high prevalence of depression is also an outlier when compared to the prevalence of major mental retardation, autism, and schizophrenia, all with prevalence rates about one tenth that of depression, or less.Epidemiologic Catchment Area, National Comorbidity Study The common occurrence and persistence of a trait like clinical depression with such negative effects early in life is difficult to explain. (Rates of infectious disease are high in young people, of course, but clinical depression is not thought to be caused by an infection.) Evolutionary psychology and its application in evolutionary medicine suggest how behaviour and mental states, including seemingly harmful states such as depression, may have been beneficial adaptations of human ancestors which improved the fitness of individuals or their relatives. It has been argued, for example, that Abraham Lincoln's lifelong depression was a source of insight and strength. Some even suggest that \\"we aren't designed to have happiness as our natural default\\" and so a state of depression is the evolutionary norm. The following hypotheses attempt to identify a benefit of depression that outweighs its obvious costs. Such hypotheses are not necessarily incompatible with one another and may explain different aspects, causes, and symptoms of depression. Psychic pain hypothesis One reason depression is thought to be a pathology is that it causes so much psychic pain and distress. However, physical pain is also very distressful, yet it has an evolved function: to inform the organism that it is suffering damage, to motivate it to withdraw from the source of damage, and to learn to avoid such damage-causing circumstances in the future. Sadness is also distressing, yet is widely believed to be an evolved adaptation. In fact, perhaps the most influential evolutionary view is that most cases of depression are simply particularly intense cases of sadness in response to adversity, such as the loss of a loved one. According to the psychic pain hypothesis, depression is analogous to physical pain in that it informs the sufferer that current circumstances, such as the loss of a friend, are imposing a threat to biological fitness. It motivates the sufferer to cease activities that led to the costly situation, if possible, and it causes him or her to learn to avoid similar circumstances in the future. Proponents of this view tend to focus on low mood, and regard clinical depression as a dysfunctional extreme of low mood—and not as a unique set of characteristics that are physiologically distanced from regular depressed mood. Alongside the absence of pleasure, other noticeable changes include psychomotor retardation, disrupted patterns of sleeping and feeding, a loss of sex drive and motivation—which are all also characteristics of the body's reaction to actual physical pain. In depressed people there is an increased activity in the regions of the cortex involved with the perception of pain, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the left prefrontal cortex. This activity allows the cortex to manifest an abstract negative thought as a true physical stressor to the rest of the brain. Behavioral shutdown model The behavioral shutdown model states that if an organism faces more risk or expenditure than reward from activities, the best evolutionary strategy may be to withdraw from them. This model proposes that emotional pain, like physical pain, serves a useful adaptive purpose. Negative emotions like disappointment, sadness, grief, fear, anxiety, anger, and guilt are described as \\"evolved strategies that allow for the identification and avoidance of specific problems, especially in the social domain.\\" Depression is characteristically associated with anhedonia and lack of energy, and those experiencing it are risk-aversive and perceive more negative and pessimistic outcomes because they are focused on preventing further loss. Although the model views depression as an adaptive response, it does not suggest that it is beneficial by the standards of current society; but it does suggest that many approaches to depression treat symptoms rather than causes, and underlying social problems need to be addressed. A related phenomenon to the behavioral shutdown model is learned helplessness. In animal subjects, a loss of control or predictability in the subject's experiences results in a condition similar to clinical depression in humans. That is to say, if uncontrollable and unstoppable stressors are repeated for long enough, a rat subject will adopt a learned helplessness, which shares a number of behavioral and psychological features with human depression. The subject will not attempt to cope with problems, even when placed in a stressor-free novel environment. Should their rare attempts at coping prove successful in a new environment, a long lasting cognitive block prevents them from perceiving their action as useful and their coping strategy does not last long. From an evolutionary perspective, learned helplessness also allows a conservation of energy for an extended period of time should people find themselves in a predicament that is outside of their control, such as an illness or a dry season. However, for today's humans whose depression resembles learned helplessness, this phenomenon usually manifests as a loss of motivation and the distortion of one uncontrollable aspect of a person's life being viewed as representative of all aspects of their life – suggesting a mismatch between ultimate cause and modern manifestation. Analytical rumination hypothesis This hypothesis suggests that depression is an adaptation that causes the affected individual to concentrate his or her attention and focus on a complex problem in order to analyze and solve it. One way depression increases the individual's focus on a problem is by inducing rumination. Depression activates the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which increases attention control and maintains problem-related information in an \\"active, accessible state\\" referred to as \\"working memory\\", or WM. As a result, depressed individuals have been shown to ruminate, reflecting on the reasons for their current problems. Feelings of regret associated with depression also cause individuals to reflect and analyze past events in order to determine why they happened and how they could have been prevented. Likewise, ruminative tendency itself, some cognitive psychologists argue, increases the likelihood of the onset of depression. Another way depression increases an individual's ability to concentrate on a problem is by reducing distraction from the problem. For example, anhedonia, which is often associated with depression, decreases an individual's desire to participate in activities that provide short-term rewards, and instead, allows the individual to concentrate on long-term goals. In addition, \\"psychomotoric changes\\", such as solitariness, decreased appetite, and insomnia also reduce distractions. For instance, insomnia enables conscious analysis of the problem to be maintained by preventing sleep from disrupting such processes. Likewise, solitariness, lack of physical activity, and lack of appetite all eliminate sources of distraction, such as social interactions, navigation through the environment, and \\"oral activity\\", which disrupt stimuli from being processed. Possibilities of depression as a dysregulated adaptation Depression, especially in the modern context, may not necessarily be adaptive. The ability to feel pain and experience depression, are adaptive defense mechanisms, but when they are \\"too easily triggered, too intense, or long lasting\\", they can become \\"dysregulated\\". In such a case, defense mechanisms, too, can become diseases, such as \\"chronic pain or dehydration from diarrhea\\". Depression, which may be a similar kind of defense mechanism, may have become dysregulated as well. Thus, unlike other evolutionary theories this one sees depression as a maladaptive extreme of something that is beneficial in smaller amounts. In particular, one theory focuses on the personality trait neuroticism. Low amounts of neuroticism may increase a person's fitness through various processes, but too much may reduce fitness by, for example, recurring depressions. Thus, evolution will select for an optimal amount and most people will have neuroticism near this amount. However, genetic variation continually occurs, and some people will have high neuroticism which increases the risk of depressions. Rank theory Rank theory is the hypothesis that, if an individual is involved in a lengthy fight for dominance in a social group and is clearly losing, then depression causes the individual to back down and accept the submissive role. In doing so, the individual is protected from unnecessary harm. In this way, depression helps maintain a social hierarchy. This theory is a special case of a more general theory derived from the psychic pain hypothesis: that the cognitive response that produces modern-day depression evolved as a mechanism that allows people to assess whether they are in pursuit of an unreachable goal, and if they are, to motivate them to desist. Social risk hypothesis This hypothesis is similar to the social rank hypothesis but focuses more on the importance of avoiding exclusion from social groups, rather than direct dominance contests. The fitness benefits of forming cooperative bonds with others have long been recognised—during the Pleistocene period, for instance, social ties were vital for food foraging and finding protection from predators. As such, depression is seen to represent an adaptive, risk-averse response to the threat of exclusion from social relationships that would have had a critical impact on the survival and reproductive success of our ancestors. Multiple lines of evidence on the mechanisms and phenomenology of depression suggest that mild to moderate (or \\"normative\\") depressed states preserve an individual's inclusion in key social contexts via three intersecting features: a cognitive sensitivity to social risks and situations (e.g., \\"depressive realism\\"); it inhibits confident and competitive behaviours that are likely to put the individual at further risk of conflict or exclusion (as indicated by symptoms such as low self-esteem and social withdrawal); and it results in signalling behaviours directed toward significant others to elicit more of their support (e.g., the so-called \\"cry for help\\"). According to this view, the severe cases of depression captured by clinical diagnoses reflect the maladaptive, dysregulation of this mechanism, which may partly be due to the uncertainty and competitiveness of the modern, globalised world. Honest signaling theory Another reason depression is thought to be a pathology is that key symptoms, such as loss of interest in virtually all activities, are extremely costly to the sufferer. Biologists and economists have proposed, however, that signals with inherent costs can credibly signal information when there are conflicts of interest. In the wake of a serious negative life event, such as those that have been implicated in depression (e.g., death, divorce), \\"cheap\\" signals of need, such as crying, might not be believed when social partners have conflicts of interest. The symptoms of major depression, such as loss of interest in virtually all activities and suicidality, are inherently costly, but, as costly signaling theory requires, the costs differ for individuals in different states. For individuals who are not genuinely in need, the fitness cost of major depression is very high because it threatens the flow of fitness benefits. For individuals who are in genuine need, however, the fitness cost of major depression is low, because the individual is not generating many fitness benefits. Thus, only an individual in genuine need can afford to suffer major depression. Major depression therefore serves as an honest, or credible, signal of need. For example, individuals suffering a severe loss such as the death of a spouse are often in need of help and assistance from others. Such individuals who have few conflicts with their social partners are predicted to experience grief—a means, in part, to signal need to others. Such individuals who have many conflicts with their social partners, in contrast, are predicted to experience depression—a means, in part, to credibly signal need to others who might be skeptical that the need is genuine. Bargaining theory Depression is not only costly to the sufferer, it also imposes a significant burden on family, friends, and society at large—yet another reason it is thought to be pathological. Yet if sufferers of depression have real but unmet needs, they might have to provide an incentive to others to address those needs. The bargaining theory of depression is similar to the honest signaling, niche change, and social navigation theories of depression described below. It draws on theories of labor strikes developed by economists to basically add one additional element to honest signaling theory: The fitness of social partners is generally correlated. When a wife suffers depression and reduces her investment in offspring, for example, the husband's fitness is also put at risk. Thus, not only do the symptoms of major depression serve as costly and therefore honest signals of need, they also compel reluctant social partners to respond to that need in order to prevent their own fitness from being reduced. Social navigation or niche change theory The social navigation or niche change hypothesisWatson, Paul J. \\"An Evolutionary Adaptationist Theory of Unipolar Depression: Depression as an adaptation for social navigation, especially for overcoming costly, complex contractual constraints of the individual's social niche\\" proposes that depression is a social navigation adaptation of last resort, designed especially to help individuals overcome costly, complex contractual constraints on their social niche. The hypothesis combines the analytical rumination and bargaining hypotheses and suggests that depression, operationally defined as a combination of prolonged anhedonia and psychomotor retardation or agitation, provides a focused sober perspective on socially imposed constraints hindering a person's pursuit of major fitness enhancing projects. Simultaneously, publicly displayed symptoms, which reduce the depressive's ability to conduct basic life activities, serve as a social signal of need; the signal's costliness for the depressive certifies its honesty. Finally, for social partners who find it uneconomical to respond helpfully to an honest signal of need, the same depressive symptoms also have the potential to extort relevant concessions and compromises. Depression's extortionary power comes from the fact that it retards the flow of just those goods and services such partners have come to expect from the depressive under status quo socioeconomic arrangements. Thus depression may be a social adaptation especially useful in motivating a variety of social partners, all at once, to help the depressive initiate major fitness-enhancing changes in their socioeconomic life. There are diverse circumstances under which this may become necessary in human social life, ranging from loss of rank or a key social ally which makes the current social niche uneconomic to having a set of creative new ideas about how to make a livelihood which begs for a new niche. The social navigation hypothesis emphasizes that an individual can become tightly ensnared in an overly restrictive matrix of social exchange contracts, and that this situation sometimes necessitates a radical contractual upheaval that is beyond conventional methods of negotiation. Regarding the treatment of depression, this hypothesis calls into question any assumptions by the clinician that the typical cause of depression is related to maladaptive perverted thinking processes or other purely endogenous sources. The social navigation hypothesis calls instead for analysis of the depressive's talents and dreams, identification of relevant social constraints (especially those with a relatively diffuse non-point source within the social network of the depressive), and practical social problem-solving therapy designed to relax those constraints enough to allow the depressive to move forward with their life under an improved set of social contracts. This theory has been the subject of criticism. Prevention of infection It has been hypothesized that depression is an evolutionary adaptation because it helps prevent infection in both the affected individual and his/her kin.Raison, C.L, Miller, A. N. (2012). The evolutionary significance of depression in Pathogen Host Defense (PATHOS-D) Molecular Psychiatry 1-23. PDF. First, the associated symptoms of depression, such as inactivity and lethargy, encourage the affected individual to rest. Energy conserved through such methods is highly crucial, as immune activation against infections is relatively costly; there must be, for instance, a 10% increase in metabolic activity for even a 1℃ change in body temperature. Therefore, depression allows one to conserve and allocate energy to the immune system more efficiently. Depression further prevents infection by discouraging social interactions and activities that may result in exchange of infections. For example, the loss of interest discourages one from engaging in sexual activity, which, in turn, prevents the exchange of sexually transmitted diseases. Similarly, depressed mothers may interact less with their children, reducing the probability of the mother infecting her kin. Lastly, the lack of appetite associated with depression may also reduce exposure to food-borne parasites. However, it should also be noted that chronic illness itself may be involved in causing depression. In animal models, the prolonged overreaction of the immune system, in response to the strain of chronic disease, results in an increased production of cytokines (a diverse group of hormonal regulators and signaling molecules). Cytokines interact with neurotransmitter systems—mainly norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin, and induce depressive characteristics. The onset of depression may help an individual recover from their illness by allowing them a more reserved, safe and energetically efficient lifestyle. The overproduction of these cytokines, beyond optimal levels due to the repeated demands of dealing with a chronic disease, may result in clinical depression and its accompanying behavioral manifestations that promote extreme energy reservation. The third ventricle hypothesis Third ventricle The third ventricle hypothesis of depression proposes that the behavioural cluster associated with depression (hunched posture, avoidance of eye contact, reduced appetites for food and sex plus social withdrawal and sleep disturbance) serves to reduce an individual's attack-provoking stimuli within the context of a chronically hostile social environment.Hendrie CA, Pickles AR (2011) Depression: An evolutionary adaptation organised around the third ventricle In: Brinkworth M, Weinert F (eds) Darwinian Repercussions Darwinism in anInterdisciplinary Context Heidelberg, New York, London: Springer It further proposes that this response is mediated by the acute release of an unknown (probably cytokine) inflammatory agent into the third ventricular space. In support of this suggestion imaging studies reveal that the third ventricle is enlarged in depressives.  Reception  Clinical psychology and psychiatry have historically been relatively isolated from the field of evolutionary psychology. Some psychiatrists raise the concern that evolutionary psychologists seek to explain hidden adaptive advantages without engaging the rigorous empirical testing required to back up such claims. While there is strong research to suggest a genetic link to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, there is significant debate within clinical psychology about the relative influence and the mediating role of cultural or environmental factors.Adams, H. and Sutker, P. Comprehensive Handbook of Psychopathology, 3rd Ed. Springer. 2001. Chapter 3, pp. 53–84. For example, epidemiological research suggests that different cultural groups may have divergent rates of diagnosis, symptomatology, and expression of mental illnesses.Adams, H. and Sutker, P. Comprehensive Handbook of Psychopathology, 3rd Ed. Springer. 2001. Chapter 5, pp. 105–27 There has also been increasing acknowledgment of culture-bound disorders,American Psychiatric Association. Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text revision). 2000. Culture Bound Syndromes, pp. 897–903. which may be viewed as an argument for an environmental versus genetic psychological adaptation.Schumaker, J. The Age of Insanity: Modernity and Mental Health. Praeger. 2001. Chapter 3, pp. 29–49. While certain mental disorders may have psychological traits that can be explained as 'adaptive' on an evolutionary scale, these disorders cause afflicted individuals significant emotional and psychological distress and negatively influence the stability of interpersonal relationships and day-to- day adaptive functioning.Adams, H. and Sutker, P.

The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The name Glen Echo refers to Glen Echo Ravine, which runs along the northern edge of the neighborhood. Principal streets in the area are Glen Echo Drive, Summit Street, Glenmawr Avenue, North Fourth Street, Arcadia, Cliffside Drive, and more. One street, Parkview Drive, was platted in the ravine basin, but was later abandoned. The district originated in 1909 when the Columbus Real Estate and Improvement Company platted as \\"Indianola Park View\\" for a planned residential subdivision and a part of the Glen Echo Ravine was delineated as a park, the first such donation to the city of Columbus by a real estate developer. The wooded Glen Echo Ravine significantly influenced the original layout, design, and overall character of the district. The neighborhood's developer was also involved with the development of Walhalla Ravine and Eastgate. Prior to its development, the area was considered for a major hospital; however, those plans were abandoned. A 1909 Ohio State publication described the new north side park as a place of beauty where large oak and elm trees shaded a wading pond, five small lakes connected by a single stream, rustic benches, foot bridges and springs lined with cobblestones. Glen Echo's picturesque environs hosted picnic dinners, equestrians and motorists who enjoyed this oasis of greenery. In 1910 the development was annexed to the City of Columbus and in 1912 Glen Echo Park was dedicated to the city. Most of the homes in the Glen Echo neighborhood were built between 1909 and 1943 and include American Craftsman style bungalows, Shingle Style, Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival, many with front and/or sleeping porches. Most homes, however are not \\"high style\\" structures, and would be classified as either traditional American Foursquare or American Vernacular in style. The homes are a mix of single and double units with a high home-owner occupancy rate. Grassy boulevards are features of Glenmawr Avenue and North Fourth Street; these elliptical islands are classified as parks with the Columbus Department of Recreation. Stone stanchions and street furniture are a hallmark of Glenmawr Avenue. The 1997 listing of the neighborhood on the National Register of Historic Places was made based on the neighborhood's overall fabric as a middle class development, rather than as a collection of high style architecture. Homes in the neighborhood are kept in good repair. Residents have attempted to distance themselves from the now defunct Glen Echo South Civic Association. A move by some residents put the question of the neighborhood's leaving the University District up for discussion; however, the city of Columbus does not have a mechanism for detaching neighborhoods from one area Commission and reattaching that area to another commission. The neighborhood is currently working on creating an active civic association (Glen Echo Neighbors Civic Association or GENCA). Monthly GENCA governance meetings open to the public are held at 4pm on the Second Saturday of every month at the Glen Echo Presbyterian Church on Cliffside Drive. The three interpretive signs located in Glen Echo Park along the vacated Parkview Drive provide walkers with insights into the history of the park. Each year, Glen Echo Neighborhood is featured on Columbus Landmarks Foundation Walking Tour.

Life Eugenio Finardi was born in Milan, Italy, on July 16, 1952, in a musical family: his father Enzo was an Italian music sound engineer and his mother Eloise an American opera singer; at age six Finardi made his first record, Palloncino Rosso Fuoco, a children song. Finardi became part of a thriving music scene in Milan in the late 1960s. Rooted in the blues, classic rock and roll and the hippy counter- culture, he was active in the left-wing youth movement of those years. In 1969 he formed his first rock band The Tiger. Soon he started playing with Alberto Camerini, a singer and guitarist born in Brazil, who a few years later would be instrumental in introducing American and British new wave and techno-pop to Italian pop music. Together they even emulated the US film Easy Rider by travelling on motorbikes from Milan to Amsterdam. The scene Finardi became part of included among others bands like Area and Stormy Six, Claudio Rocchi and female singer-songwriter Donatella Bardi. Finardi made a living by day teaching English, in which he was fluent because of his American mother, and as a musician by night, as singer, guitarist and piano-player. After forming the band Il Pacco with Camerini, Finardi recorded a single in English in 1973, Spacey Stacey/Hard Rock Honey for Numero Uno, the first Italian independent record label started by singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti and his writing partner Mogol, who had a long string of Italian and international hits under their belts, and who had introduced in Italian Pop music different styles from the US and the UK, from the Rock music of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, to Blues and Soul. Finardi's single went largely unnoticed. Early career, the 1970s Thanks to his friendship with the band Area and their singer Demetrio Stratos, in 1974 Finardi signed with the label Cramps, run by Gianni Sassi. 1975 saw the release of his first album Non Gettate Alcun Oggetto Dal Finestrino. The album was a mixture of the style of Italian singer-songwriters and Rock'n'Roll. Camerini on guitar, Lucio Fabbri on violin, Walter Calloni on drums were among the musicians who played on the record, which included a Rock version of traditional Italian protest folk-song Saluteremo Il Signor Padrone, and original songs by Finardi – one, Taking It Easy, in English – with social commentary about metropolitan alienation, against the compulsory national service in the Italian army, and political prisoners. The album was influenced by both progressive rock, which was extremely popular in Italy, and Hippie idealism. Finardi became known from playing at Milan's alternative Festival in Parco Lambro in 1976, introducing a Rock sound to the Italian genre of singer-songwriters who were often politically involved, and mostly somewhat derivative of Folk Rock, the early protest songs of Bob Dylan, and of the American West-Coast music of artists like Neil Young. Finardi looked to the more electric and up-tempo sound of Rock&Roll; and The Rolling Stones, and his sound was also often influenced by Jazz Rock fusion, thanks to Area members Patrizio Fariselli and Ares Tavolazzi, and bass-player Hugh Bullen. Years of lead Finardi's sound and style became a success in 1976, with his second album Sugo, and his third Diesel in 1977. The first included the counter-cultural youth anthem Musica Ribelle, and the hymn to pirate radio-stations La Radio; the second the love ballad Non e' Nel Cuore, which were all released as singles. Finardi, who had started performing live often on his own with an acoustic guitar and sitting down, was now touring with a four or five-piece Rock band. His introduction of Rock'n'Roll in the genre of socially and politically aware Italian singer- songwriters was what made Finardi stand out and endeared him to the counter- cultural youth of late 1970s Italy, which in 1976–78 was in the midst of political upheaval and almost civil war, with the occupations of factories, universities and high-schools, demonstrations which ended in pitched battles with the police – often with fatal casualties – and the rise of political movements like Autonomia, the Indiani Metropolitani and terrorist groups like the Red Brigades (Brigate Rosse). This eventful period of Italian contemporary history is known as the Anni di piombo (Years Of Lead) and also as the era of the Movimento '77, the youth movement for which 1977 was a pivotal year, somewhat an Italian equivalent of the Punk Rock upheaval in the US and Great Britain. The dramatic and eventful climate of the period was the result of the so-called Strategy of tension (Strategia della tensione): the confrontation between youth counter-culture and left-wing activists against an Italian government perceived as reactionary, repressive, corrupt, unstable, manoeuvred by the US, which disseminated disinformation and engaged in false-flag terror attacks blamed on the left to establish a more authoritarian regime. Finardi was a notable counter-cultural and musical protagonist of these years, with songs like La C.I.A. about the American Secret Services' involvement in Italian politics, Soldi about consumerism, Giai Phong, about the Vietnam War, Scuola about the education system, Tutto Subito about the confrontational street demos of Autonomia, and Scimmia which chronicled Finardi's past heroin addiction and subsequent self-detoxification through 'cold turkey', a particularly relevant song for touching upon a subject that would become a growing social problem in Italy starting in the following decade, the 1980s. Songs like Voglio and Oggi Ho Imparato A Volare were optimistic hymns for the revolutionary youth of the Italian left, and Diesel celebrated both Finardi's life on the road as a musician and the life of everyday working-class Italians. Finardi started to make his transition from this turbulent period of Italian history and its cultural landscape with the album Blitz and single Extraterrestre in 1978, and Roccando Rollando (Rocking and Rolling) in 1979, which contained Legalizzatela, his song-manifesto for the legalization of cannabis. Other significant hits were Patrizia, and the bitter-sweet ballad Le Ragazze Di Osaka in 1981. From the 1980s to the present Since then Finardi has lived periodically abroad, in London, UK, and in the United States. He has appeared at the Mecca of Italian commercial Pop music, the annual musical contest of the Sanremo Festival, which would have been unthinkable in the counter-cultural climate of the 1970s. Through many different collaborations, he has released regular albums: among them one made entirely of songs with English lyrics, Secret Streets in 1982; the live album Strade (1984), Dolce Italia (1987), the entirely acoustic Acustica in 1993, for which he toured in the same 'unplugged' mode, the re-reading of songs from his back catalogue Cinquantanni in 2002, his exploration of spirituality Il Silenzio e Lo Spirito in 2003, and a return to his youthful love for the Blues with the album Anima Blues in 2005. Eugenio Finardi's most recent works have a large audience, as proven by the success of the album Un Uomo (2007), a compilation of a 30 years long career, celebrated also in the show Suono in Italian theatres – and released also on DVD – in which Finardi tells his story through a series of monologues. His last work Il Cantante Al Microfono saw him accompanied by a classical music sextet. Eugenio Finardi's albums from the 1970s are considered classics of Italian Rock, and he remains one of Italy's most successful and influential Rock singers and musicians. In 2012 he again entered the music competition of the Sanremo Music Festival with the song E tu lo chiami Dio.

Gunns Limited went into voluntary administration in 2012, and on August 30, 2017, the permits for the proposed building lapsed, signalling the end of the project. A Gunns spokesperson said they will not contest the lapsing of the permits. Proposed mill The proposed mill is to use the Kraft process, with Elemental Chlorine Free bleaching, and it is claimed it is to be fed with 100 per cent plantation grown eucalyptus feed stock, having a production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per annum of Air Dried pulp. Construction of the mill is supported by the State Government and the Federal Government and opposed by a number of environmentally focused and other local community groups. Historical and local context It is not the first pulp mill proposed for Tasmania. In 1989 Wesley Vale pulp mill was proposed but did not go ahead. The Wesley Vale project was to be a kraft mill and was also subject local opposition due to its use of elemental chlorine as the main bleaching chemical, which was a convention of that time. As a result of the failure of the Wesley Vale project, a major series of scientific studies termed the National Pulp Mills Research ProgramSearch Results  National Library of Australia was commissioned by the Commonwealth Government to support an update and strengthening of the Australian guidelines for this industry sector. At about the same time, significant changes in bleaching technology and waste water treatment in relation to kraft pulp mills were also being made throughout the world.http://tasmaniapulpmill.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/ecos_mag_1994_pulp_mill_research.74212036.pdf On completion of the scientific studies, the Tasmanian guidelines for any new Tasmanian mill were then developed and published in 2004, which included provisions that meant that any future project must implement either Elemental Chlorine Free or Totally Chlorine Free bleaching technology. Tasmania was an innovator in pulp and paper in the 1930s and 40s, with one pulp mill established in the Derwent Valley and one at Burnie. The Burnie pulp mill no longer exists and the mill in the Derwent Valley (Boyer) is vastly different from that proposed for the Tamar Valley, being a smaller scale (295,000 tpa), a thermo-mechanical process and includes paper making machines (producing news print on site), in comparison to the more sophisticated kraft process producing higher value pulp for further processing into copying paper, tissues etc. by off-site customers. Economics The State commissioned research that reported the project will generate $6.7 billion in spending over 25 years and create up to 1600 temporary jobs during the construction phase. After construction, it has been estimated by consultants engaged by Gunns that approximately 3100 extra long term jobs will be created in Tasmania and that approximately one twelfth of these will be employed by the operator at the pulp mill. A report by Naomi Edwards, Economics Adviser to Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown has questioned the financial viability of the proposed Tamar Valley pulp mill. Greens Senator Christine Milne was criticised for describing the report as \\"independent\\" when it was written by a Greens adviser and paid for by Senator Milne using her taxpayer-funded allowance. A January 2008 report commissioned by The Wilderness Society estimated the Bell Bay Pulp Mill may run at a $300 million loss to Tasmania. However the company told the Australian Securities Exchange in February 2011 that the mill would generate between A$475 and A$500 in pre-tax earnings.\\" The company has released statements (on numerous occasions – 2008, 2009 and 2010) that it was in negotiations with several partners to secure financial backing for the proposed pulp mill. A new company called Southern Star Corporation has been set up to build and operate the pulp mill. It is a private company with Gunns intending to retain a 51% equity share with the remaining 49% being made available for potential investors. Location The proposed site had been classified as a Private Conservation Area (Sanctuary) since 1958 but this was revoked by the Tasmanian State Government in 2007 (under section 21 of the Nature Conservation Act 2002). The proposed site is at Long Reach and is adjacent to the industrial area known as Bell Bay which is currently zoned 'Heavy Industrial'. Industry already located at Bell Bay includes an aluminum smelter, a metallurgical plant, a gas-fired thermal power station (decommissioned), a recently commissioned combined cycle gas turbine power station and a saw-milling and wood chipping facility. Included in the proposed development is construction of a large warehouse and wharf north of and not within the Tamar River Conservation Area as well as the installation of a water supply pipe to be drilled under or 'jet trenched' into the bed of the Tamar River in order to cross it. The proposed Pulp Mill will also include on site production of chlorine dioxide and other chemicals and a steam turbine power station fed by a large Recovery boiler and a smaller Biomass boiler. Project assessment and approval The Tasmanian Government employed the Finnish consultants, Sweco Pic, to conduct an environmental impact assessment of the proposed mill. Community groups opposed to the mill criticised the choice of this company. Gunns withdrew from Tasmania's independent planning and development assessment process (the RPDC) in March 2007 after senior RPDC panel members cited the mill design as 'critically non-compliant'. The next day then premier Paul Lennon recalled parliament and by the end of the month new fast-track pulp mill assessment legislation was passed by both Houses of Parliament. On 4 October 2007 the then federal Minister for Environment and Water Resources, Malcolm Turnbull, gave Commonwealth approval for the mill which had previously been given approval at a state level by the Tasmanian Government. Turnbull stated that an extra 24 conditions, beyond a series of draft departmental conditions previously published, would be imposed on the project giving a total of 48 conditions. He said the decision was based on science and recommendations made by the Australian Governments chief scientist Dr Jim Peacock. Tasmanian Premier, Paul Lennon, said the federal conditions duplicate permit conditions already mandated by the Tasmanian parliament. He has also noted that one benchmark had been relaxed from draft conditions, being the monthly average concentration limit of chlorate in the effluent.Lennon discusses pulp mill approval (Lateline, ABC, 4 October 2007.) In 2009, (then) Federal Environment Minister, Peter Garrett, would not grant the proposed mill the final necessary operational approval before then planned studies were completed on its potential impact on the marine environment and allowed Gunns a further twenty six months to complete the studies. A new condition was also placed on the mill, meaning Gunns could be liable for criminal and civil penalties if the mill breached defined \\"environmental limits\\" during operations. In early March 2011, following a one-week delay after Gunns contacted his department the day prior to the deadline requesting tougher environment standards, the Federal Environment Minister, Tony Burke, gave the final approval for the Gunns' proposed pulp mill, on the basis of tougher environmental conditions requested by the company itself. Burke stated that demands made by environmental groups opposed to the development, particularly with regards to the chemical process to be used in the plant, had been addressed. One of those conditions concerned the bleaching process, described by the minister as \\"elemental chlorine free\\" or ECF. Dr Karen Stack, a part-time lecturer and researcher in the School of Chemistry at the University of Tasmania, states an ECF system uses chlorine dioxide instead of chlorine to bleach the pulp, which greatly reduces the levels of organochlorines that make it out into the environment through effluent released from a pulp mill. She describes this system a more environmentally friendly process. Opposition Anti-pulpmill rally (April 2007) Launceston rally. Opponents of the mill include a number of environmental, social activist and political groups including The Wilderness Society, and TAP into a better Tasmania (formerly Tasmanians Against the Pulpmill). There have been numerous rallies, public meetings, actions and protests around the entire state and especially in the north since the pulp mill was proposed. In September 2006, a protest rally against the proposed pulp mill was held in Launceston with speakers, included Greens politician Christine Milne and TV gardener Peter Cundall. In June 2007, an opposition rally to the mill attracted a crowd estimated at 10 000 and Richard Flanagan made a speech at a rally in the state's capital, Hobart, in November 2007. In August 2008, approximately 5 000 people attended a protest rally in Launceston and in March 2011, a \\"No Pulp Mill\\" rally was held at the iconic Batman Bridge in the Tamar Valley. In May 2011, another rally was held in Launceston opposing the pulp mill where Greens MP Kim Booth stated he would move a no confidence motion in the government if any more money was spent to support the pulp mill project. Protesters listened and watched outside parliament as the Tasmanian Greens attempted a last-ditch bid to revoke a law allowing Gunns to build the $2.3 billion pulp mill in the Tamar Valley. It failed when Labor and the Liberals joined to vote down the bill to repeal the Pulp Mill Assessment Act, which was fast-tracked through Parliament in 2007. In addition to these, there have been numerous community meetings in Launceston including one regarding concerns surrounding the pipe line in 2008 a pulp mill information night in 2009 and No Pulp Mill public meetings in December 2010 and March 2011. There have also been protests outside the ANZ bank, at Gunns' AGMs at their headquarters in Launceston and at the offices of state and federal politicians. In April 2007, allegations were made that a Gunns lawyer was involved in preparing new legislation introduced by then Premier Paul Lennon which bypasses the Resource Planning and Development CommissionResource Planning and Development Commission (RPDC) and replaces it with a government-appointed consultant which raised questions about Gunns influence over the current State Labor government. There are other allegations of collusion and co-operation between the company and Tasmania's political leaders. Professor Quentin Beresford from Perth WA has written an academic paper citing the Lennon government's approval of the Gunns pulp mill in Tasmania as a case study to illustrate the notion of institutional corruption. Gunns sued 20 environmental organisations and individuals for some $6 million in the days preceding the announcement of its plans to build a pulp mill in the Tamar Valley. The proposal had been criticised for not using accepted technology for the bleaching process and instead involved the presence of elemental chlorine at an intermediate stage (rather than hydrogen peroxide or methanol) in the production of the main bleaching chemical chlorine dioxide. This particular criticism could only refer to Gunns' original preferred chemical plant design termed and 'integrated' chemical plant, which was one of three chemical plant designs presented for assessment.http://www.gunnspulpmill.com.au/iis/V6/V6_A7.pdf The integrated process as then described by Gunns had not been approved by the United Nations Environment Programme as Accepted Modern Technology (AMT) for this purpose and therefore was inconsistent with Tasmanian guidelines.Radio Marinara 3RRR, 15 April 2007. Dr Warwick Raverty, Pulping Chemist.National Toxics Network Inc (oztoxics.org) Pulp Mill Brief. Dr Mariann Lloyd-Smith PhD. By comparison, the two alternative chemical plant designs, presented by Gunns as \\"merchant chemical plant alternative 1\\" and \\"2\\" were AMT. According to, Dr Warwick Raverty, a chemist with over 20 years experience in the Kraft pulping and paper, a hiccup with a waterspray within an \\"integrated\\" process could cause the bleaching chemical chlorine dioxide to be contaminated with elemental chlorine. Elemental chlorine contamination of the chlorine dioxide bleaching chemical could in turn lead to the release of persistent organic pollutants (dioxins), potentially causing environmental harm and a subsequent breach of the Stockholm Convention. The \\"integrated\\" design for chlorine dioxide generation was not selected by Gunns to proceed as it was effectively prevented from implementation by the State Permit (Condition 3GN9.1). Gunns has subsequently indicated it will move from \\"ECF\\" to \\"ECF-Light\\" bleaching, which is facilitated by moving from \\"Merchant alternative 1\\" to \\"Merchant alternative 2\\" within the final design of the chemical plant described above. Raverty resigned from the now defunct Resource Planning and Development Commission (RPDC) panel on the mill, citing undue political interference. In July 2007, The Wilderness Society launched a legal case against the federal government, claiming the Federal Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Malcolm Turnbull, acted illegally by allowing the pulp mill to escape proper assessment by the independent RPDC. Turnbull agreed to withhold a decision on the approval of the mill until after the 6 August conclusion of the case. The case was dismissed in August 2007.Sydney Morning Herald. 4 October 2007. \\"Timeline for the pulp mill project\\" Former Gunns director, John Gay, had previously put pressure on the state government to approve the mill quickly by threatening to take the project interstate or overseas: the company has already invested an estimated $100 million (5% of expenditure) on plans and consultants for the $2.3 billion project. Geoffrey Cousins, former adviser to John Howard, has also been a vocal opponent of the mill, comparing it to the Franklin River Dam.The Age. 5 October 2007. p1 & 11. Paul Lennon has claimed that the wood supply agreement \\"will not provide for any old growth timber to be used in the pulp mill.\\",Lateline. 04/10/2007 ABC Lennon discusses pulp mill approval while Peter Garrett has said that the tracts of old growth forest that will supply the mill were already earmarked for logging under the Regional Forest Agreement.The Age. 6 October 2007. \\"Garrett defends his support of pulp mill\\" In January 2010, the company told the Australian Securities Exchange that the mill would not use any old growth or other native timber, and would be 100 per cent plantation timber fed from start-up. A second legal challenge against the Federal approval process for the Pulp Mill was undertaken by a group known as Lawyers For Forests (LFF). The case questioned the legality of the decision making process taken by former Environment Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. The LFF claimed in court that Mr Turnbull did not adequately assess the proposed mill as he was required to by law.The Australian. 18 June 2008. \\"Legal challenge to Tasmanian pulp mill underway\\" The case was dismissed in April 2009The Age. 10 April 2009. \\"Legal win for Gunns in fight for Tassie mill\\" and costs awarded against Lawyers For Forests.Crikey.com.au. 12 May 2009. \\"Garrett and Gunns win: Lawyers for Forests face massive legal costs\\" The Wilderness Society, Environment Tasmania and the Australian Conservation Foundation have welcomed the Gunns pledge to improve effluent standards and promised to support them if the details released by Gunns matched the commitment, but agree that the community would never give a \\"Social Approval\\" for the mill. The Wilderness Society spokesman Vica Bayley has stated that The Wilderness Society would never approve the contentious pulp mill, regardless of any future changes to its design or operations, citing the \\"corrupted\\" approval process making it forever unacceptable. This new tough stance coincided with further splits emerging between Tasmanian environmental groups over the failure to halt logging in all high-conservation-value forests in an immediate moratorium. Dr Phill Pullinger of Environment Tasmania stated in March 2011 that \\"It's not a proposal that we'll ever be in a position that we'll endorse or support\\".

Its business was located at the mouth of the Crane Creek Canyon. In the 1920s the company moved to Lawson Creek and built the railroad spur in 1928. The spur was built as the result of Crane Creek's successful bid to the National Forest Service, in 1926, for 194 million board feet of timber in the Modoc National Forest's Fandango Logging Unit. Ponderosa Pine was a primary species that was logged. The company built a planing mill and box factory at Willow Creek near the NCO. In the 1930s a fire destroyed the Lawson Creek operations of the company. The company also built a standard gauge logging railroad which operated from a junction with the Nevada-California-Oregon Railway (NCO) at Willow Creek, California (link is incorrect Willow Creek), running southeast for 16.5 miles into the Modoc National Forest. The track was constructed in 1928, abandoned in 1930, and removed in 1934. The railroad used an oil fueled Shay locomotive that hauled two flatcars of lumber. The Shay, Numbered #1 (Shay Serial Number 2733) was built by Shay in 1913 for the Crookston Lumber Company. The CCLC bought the locomotive in 1928. The locomotive was sold again in 1947.

The Ashley Centre was opened in October 1984 by Queen Elizabeth II as The Ashley Centre, a development combined of shops, a multi-storey car park, office space and a theatre space. In 2005, it was acquired by The Mall Company and rebranded throughout as The Mall Epsom. In 2009, the centre was sold again and purchased by Bride Hall Group. It was relaunched in April 2009 and has now reverted to the original name of The Ashley Centre. Development The centre was designed to have minimal impact on the streetscape of Epsom High Street, as it incorporated many of the traditional older buildings that existed along the High Street - for example the old Lester Bowden shop and Marks & Spencer's marketplace entrances. The taller buildings of the centre are located furthest from the marketplace so as to not be intrusive to the older buildings of the town. These are the service facilities and the car park. Anchor stores on opening were Army & Navy Stores (later rebranded as Dickens & Jones and later House of Fraser) and Marks & Spencer. Epsom town centre was later given a one-way system, built to ease the flow of traffic around and through the town, and to fit in with the entrance/exit requirements of the new multi-storey car park. In 2006, a major redesign of the centre was undertaken, to incorporate space for a large new Boots store in the centre. This took over the space previously occupied by Kings' Shade Walk, a shorter mall corridor linking the centre to Epsom marketplace. In 2009 the toilet and baby change facilities at the centre were revamped to give better access for disabled/less-able customers.  Transport  Bus links are provided from Reigate, Redhill, Guildford, Leatherhead, Tadworth, Crawley, Dorking, Kingston upon Thames, Ewell, Worcester Park, Cheam, Sutton, Croydon and Colliers Wood into Epsom town centre, with The Ashley Centre being located opposite the main stops by the Clock Tower. The Ashley Centre provides a multi-storey car park and offers Shopmobility for less-able visitors to the centre. The centre is a five-minute walk from Epsom railway station.

Although successful with several of these ventures, he remains best known for missing the Porcupine Gold Rush by only a few feet, a huge deposit being discovered directly beside one of his abandoned test digs. His last major discovery was a major iron deposit in Labrador, although he was unable to personally develop the site due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which dried up development funds. He was so well known that his death was mentioned in Time Magazine, who quoted his easygoing take on his losses in Labrador; \\"I was just there a darn sight too soon, but I have certainly enjoyed myself.\\"Time Magazine Monday, Aug. 17, 1959 D'Aigle was born in Chipman, New Brunswick. In 1898 he decided to join the Klondike Gold Rush, at this point in full swing and unlikely to make any newcomers wealthy. Taking the slow route, he travelled via ship from New Brunswick around Cape Horn. Travelling up the Yukon River he went past the major goldfields and prospected on the Koyukuk River, a tributary in Alaska. At Cleary Creek he found a small gold camp getting set up, and eventually staked thirty claims in the area, one of which proved to be the richest in the area. When he sold out his claims seven years later he had to wheel his gold to a waiting steamer in a wheelbarrow. He deposited his winnings in Seattle, and started looking for new fields, but nothing seemed to be worth investigating. He returned east when he heard of the silver rush in Cobalt, Ontario, but when he arrived all the good sites were already staked. Instead of looking for new sites in the area, as he had in the Klondike, he returned south and enrolled in a new geology course at Queen's University. While better learning his trade he pored over survey reports in the library. He eventually found one that seemed enticing, a report of gold in the Porcupine Lake area. As soon as the course ended he collected a set of gear and headed north. Picking up a Metis guide, Billy Moore, they canoed up the Mattagami River to the Porcupine area and started surveying the entire area. Although they noticed much gold, it was in the form of small flakes embedded in quartz, as opposed to the easily mined nuggets he was used to from the Klondike. This was far less impressive, but he nevertheless decided to return the next year, in 1907, with a larger team to make a more thorough sweep, this time digging into the quartz mounds that dotted the area. Although they were again successful in finding gold, no one in the party considered it worthwhile mining. Eventually they simply gave up, dumped their tools in one of their test pits, and headed south. It is one of the great ironies of mining history that the pit was only feet from another quartz mound that was described as \\"dripping\\" gold. The team that found it later stated that a heelprint from one of D'Aigle's team was clearly visible, impressed into the gold they never noticed. Stories of gold in the Lower Quebec area had interested Noah A. Timmins and Reuben D'Aigle had been grubstaked by Timmins heard these stories. In 1910 he showed up in Sept Iles and questioned a Montagnais Native, Pierre Rich, about these stories. Using his own capital he hired other Montagnais and prospected for a few years until his money was exhausted. In 1919 he was employed by the Ungava Exploration Company and was the first prospector to identify the huge deposits of iron ore around the Wabush Lake Zone in Labrador, Newfoundland.

The school has approximately 1180 enrollments and has achieved top High School Diploma (High school certificate) scores. History The decision to build a new high school at North Carlingford was made in early 1967. Though the decision was originally not well received by the community, especially parents who lived in close proximity to Cumberland High School and whose children were already being sent by bus to Pennant Hills High School, building of the new school commenced in the Autumn. The contractor, A.V Jennings, was to complete sufficient of the building to enable the school to open on the first school day in 1968. In October, the first principal, MJ Maiden, met 165 students who were in first form at Pennant Hills High School and who were destined for the new school, known officially at this stage as \\"Carlingford North High School\\". The students were dressed in school uniform designed by a committee of parents appointed by R. Stacey, principal of Pennant Hills High School. A further meeting was held with the parents where a motion was carried that the Department of Education be asked to name the school \\"Carlingford High School\\". Two more meetings were held with the committee prior to the beginning of the new school year. At these meetings, finalized arrangements for the first school day of 1968 were made, along with the establishment of a school badge and motto. Much thought went into the latter with a view to linking the badge with the name \\"Carlingford\\". From H. Faters, former headmaster of Carlingford Rural School, informed the committee that Carlingford was named after Carlingford in Ireland. Maiden, wrote to the Embassy of Ireland in Canberra and received information about Irish Carlingford. It was then decided to design a badge and motto that would incorporate the \\"Venturegameness\\" of the Vikings and the idea that education should be an adventure. The design of the badge would be in keeping with the design of the school and with an Australian flavour, hence the square, severe line of the badge and the boomerang on which the motto appears. Several different designs were worked on by artists at \\"Perfection Plate\\" and indeed the Maiden family also worked on the design.After a quite argumentative meeting the committee finally reached a decision with the agreed motto \\"Adventure in Learning\\" put forward by the appointed deputy principal Mr. N. Leeder and the badge design created by Maiden's wife. Carlingford High was the first NSW school to have a student council rather than prefects, an innovation of Maiden.interview with former student Diane Isaacs, now Di Bartok NewsLocal journalist, published in Northern District Times circa 1974. As late as the Thursday before school was to resume it was by no means certain that the school would be open due to inclement weather, and the light flooding of B block. Although the weather cleared and concrete was poured on the Friday, And because of an unseasonably warm weekend, the school was able to be officially opened on Tuesday 31 January 1968. This school is currently located on North Rocks Road between two primary schools, Roselea Public School and St Gerard's Primary Catholic School, near the Plympton Rd Music The school has many music ensembles.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 627.The Guantanamo Docket - Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi He is an orthopedic surgeon who graduated from medical school in Pakistan and pursued postdoctoral studies there. On March 30, 2009, the Justice Department announced that the administration had decided to release Dr. Batarfi. Batarfi was the second captive to be cleared for release by the Obama administration's review of captives' status. Press reports He claimed that he was forced to work as a doctor at the 2001 Battle of Tora Bora, during which time he treated injured mujahideen fighters inside the region's complex caves. At one of his Administrative Review Board hearings, he confirmed that Osama bin Laden was present during the battle, claiming that he had met with him for ten minutes. On May 25, 2008, the Yemen Times reported that a number of the Yemeni captives in Guantanamo had gone certifiably insane under the conditions there. The article quoted the recently released Sudanese journalists Sami Al Hajj, who reported that Yemeni captives had been driven insane through the administration of hallucinogenic drugs. In his book The longest war, Peter Bergen quoted Batarfi, \\"He did not prepare himself for Tora Bora and to be frank he didn't care about anyone but himself.\\" =Summary of Evidence memo= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, on November 2, 2004. The memo listed the following allegations against him: Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi v. George W. Bush A writ of habeas corpus, Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi v. George W. Bush, was submitted on Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi's behalf before US District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan. In response, on August 4, 2005, the Department of Defense released seventeen pages of unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. He is being represented by Baltimore lawfirm Murphy & Shaffer. On November 12, 2004, Tribunal panel 15 confirmed his \\"enemy combatant\\" status. According to the decision memo in his dossier: On January 6, 2009, Sullivan admonished the Bush administration for improperly withholding exculpatory evidence. He said that the Department of Justice had withheld as many as ten documents from him. Sullivan stated that, now that the documents had been made available to him, he would need at least until a hearing scheduled for 9 March to decide whether Batarfi should be released. In early April 2009, Sullivan admonished the Justice Department for withholding that one of the witnesses against Batarfi was seriously mentally ill. The Kansas City Star reported that a transcript of the hearing recorded Sullivan saying: The Kansas City Star reported that the unredacted portions of the transcript suggested the unnamed witness suffered from \\"anti-social personality disorder\\"—which would have prevented him from understanding the difference between right and wrong, and would make him likely to lie. Bill Murphy, one of Batarfi's lawyers, said: = Administrative Review Board = Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. =First annual Administrative Review Board= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi's first annual Administrative Review Board, on October 31, 2005. The four page memo listed thirty-nine \\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\\" and two \\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\\". Transcript In the Spring of 2006, in response to a court order from Jed Rakoff the Department of Defense published a twenty page summarized transcript from his Administrative Review Board. Attached to the transcript were three letters from family members. =Second annual Administrative Review Board= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Ayman Batarfi's second annual Administrative Review Board, on November 28, 2006. The four page memo listed thirty-six \\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\\" and two \\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\\". Transcript In September 2007, the Department of Defense released the transcripts from the 2006 Board hearings which captives attended. Repatriation On March 30, 2009, it was widely reported that Batarfi was the second captive to be cleared through the new review procedures put in place by United States President Barack Obama. The BBC quoted Dean Boyd, a US justice department spokesman, who indicated Batarfi would be transferred to a third country. Boyd indicated that Batarfi would be transferred: \\"to an appropriate destination country... in a manner that is consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice.\\" Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that US District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan had scheduled Batarfi's habeas corpus hearing for early April. William Glaberson, writing in The New York Times, reported that, according to Justice department filings, Batarfi might face prosecution in the third country he was transferred to. Glaberson reported that although Batarfi had agreed to a stay of his habeas petition, to give US diplomats a chance to find a third country to accept him, he reserved the right to re-open the case if he objected to the conditions of his transfer. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald reported that Ayman Batarfi was one of twelve men transferred from Guantanamo on December 19, 2009. According to Rosenberg Justice Department officials said that Batarfi release had been approved in March 2009. She reported that he was one of the Guantanamo captives who had described himself as a humanitarian aid worker. The other eleven men were: Jamal Alawi Mari, Farouq Ali Ahmed, Muhammad Yasir Ahmed Taher, Fayad Yahya Ahmed al Rami, Riyad Atiq Ali Abdu al Haf, Abdul Hafiz, Sharifullah, Mohamed Rahim, Mohammed Hashim, Ismael Arale and Mohamed Suleiman Barre. Abdul Hafiz, Sharifullah, Mohamed Rahim and Mohammed Hashim were Afghans. Asmael Arale and Mohamed Suleiman Barre were Somalis. The other five men were fellow Yemenis. On January 5, 2010, Jay Solomon, writing in The Wall Street Journal reported that Batarfi, and the five other Yemeni men repatriated with him, faced indefinite detention in Yemen. Solomon reported that the indefinite detention was part of the secret agreement negotiated between American and Yemeni officials, prior to the Americans agreeing to repatriate the men. 2008 and 2009 assessments of risks posed by Batarfi In testimony before Congress, on January 13, 2010, White House official John Brennan was asked to justify the release of Batarfi, in light of the allegations he was associated with an al Qaeda Weapons of Mass Destruction plan. A follow-up letter, from Brennan, to Nancy Pelosi, was made public in 2011. On April 25, 2011, the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret documents signed by the Guantanamo camp commandants. Batarfi's document was 15 pages long, signed by Admiral Mark H Buzby, and dated April 29, 2008. During his appearance before Congress, Congressional Representative Frank Wolf, asked Brennan to explain why Batarfi had been cleared for release, when earlier military status reviews concluded there was reason to believe he had met Osama bin Laden, and that there was reason to believe he had played a role in an al Qaeda Weapons of Mass Destruction plan. In his written reply Brennan stated that the joint task force the Obama administration had put in place had conducted their own more recent review, and concluded the suspicions held against Batarfi weren't substantial enough to justify his detention. In commentary on Brennan's justification in The Weekly Standard third-party counter-terrorism analyst Thomas Joscelyn challenged Brennan's defense of the Obama appointed 2009 review, by citing the allegations in the 2008 Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment. Joscelyn quoted several passages from the 2008 military assessment that asserted Batarfi had helped provide Yazid Sufaat with medical laboratory equipment that was intended to be used to develop an anthrax weapon. Joscelyn quoted another passage from the documents, about Batarfi's ties to Dr Amer Aziz, a mentor Batarfi worked under, during his internship. Aziz had a long history of making trips to Afghanistan to treat wounded mujahideen, dating back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, when the CIA supported them in their battle against the Soviet Union. On October 21, 2002, Aziz was seized by American security officials, who held him, and interrogated him for a month. Following his release Aziz acknowledged his travels to Afghanistan to provide medical care, and acknowledged that those he treated had included senior members of al-Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden. He acknowledged he had treated bin Laden in 1999 and in November 2001. However, Aziz asserted he had no knowledge of any terrorist plans, and that he had not known he would be called upon to treat bin Laden when he travelled to Afghanistan. Joscelyn quoted the Guantanamo assessment, which said that during his interrogation, Aziz indicated he thought Batarfi was \\"quite keen\\" on fighting and \\"fully believed in al-Qaida.\\" References External links * The Story of Ayman Batarfi, a Doctor in Guantánamo Andy Worthington Yemeni extrajudicial prisoners of the United States Living people Guantanamo detainees known to have been released Yemeni expatriates in Pakistan Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi"},{"id":"13190685","text":"Pennsylvania Route 890 (PA 890) is an state highway located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania.

Leaving Trevorton, the route becomes an unnamed road and heads west across forested Little Mountain. While crossing the mountain, the road briefly enters Shamokin Township before heading into Rockefeller Township. After crossing the mountain, PA 890 enters a mix of farmland and woodland with a few scattered residences, turning to the north. The road passes through Augustaville and continues through more agricultural surroundings with scattered woods and homes. PA 890 heads northwest through more rural areas before entering Upper Augusta Township and reaching its northern terminus at PA 61 in the residential community of Hamilton.

The format is a derivative of the HD DVD, a medium created by the DVD Forum designed to succeed regular DVDs. Although HD DVD was scrapped as a result of losing the format war to Blu-ray, CBHDs continued to be produced and marketed, though only in China. History Originally called CH-DVD, CBHD is a joint venture between the DVD Forum and OMNERC. Development began in 2005, and an early prototype was demonstrated in 2007. In 2008, during the DVD Forum's 42nd Steering Committee Meeting, the DVD Forum gave OMNERC the permission to edit HD DVD specifications. Though HD DVD proponents had hoped that CBHD would be a viable successor to the HD DVD format, the CBHD spec was ultimately incompatible with HD DVD players despite the similarities between the two. As a result, CBHD is a proprietary format unique to China. Technology Development of CBHD, heavily based on the HD DVD standard, was greatly helped by Japanese engineers. In particular, Hisashi Yamada, former Chief Technology Fellow at Toshiba's Digital Media Network, often referred to as the \\"father of DVD,\\" has played a key role in China's plan to create its own high-definition consumer video format.Japanese engineers help China's homegrown hi-def disc development CBHD differs from HD DVD in several key areas. CBHD uses the PRC government-owned AVS video codec, DRA audio codec, and a new copy protection system, DKAA, as an alternative to HD DVD's and Blu- ray's AACS.Why CBHD ChinaHDA.orgChina Adopts New HD Disc Standard, HD DVD Reaches 51GB CBHD's developers claim the format contains more copy protection features and is part of a big push by China to fight piracy in addition to reducing their reliance upon foreign patents with their associated royalty payments.

According to an August 2009 television story by TV-Tokyo, CBHD was outselling rival Blu-ray by a margin of 3 to 1 in China (due to heavy advertisement and favored backing from the government).

It lies on the R698 regional road, which was the N24 national primary road before the locality was bypassed in 2002. Approaching Piltown from Carrick-on-Suir in the west is the landmark of \\"the Tower\\" ( Sham Castle ) which forms a roundabout in the road. This monument, dedicated to the son of a local landowner, dates back to the Napoleonic era. Today its upper section serves as a water tower. Piltown is also home to Ireland's largest Horticultural and Agricultural College, Kildalton College. The college hosts a fair called the Iverk Show, named after the Barony of Iverk, on the fourth Saturday in August each year.

In the Battle of Piltown (1462) Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, on the side of the House of York, defeated the Butlers of Kilkenny, fighting for the House of Lancaster, resulting in more than 400 casualties for the Butlers. Local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood, hence the names Pill River and Piltown (Baile an Phuill - Town of the blood). From the early eighteenth century up until the late 1930s, the main landlords in Piltown and its surrounding area were the Ponsonby dynasty, Earls of Bessborough. The family seat was Bessborough House, just outside Piltown, built in the 1740s for the 1st Earl. The house was gutted by fire in February 1923, during the Irish Civil War. However, it was rebuilt in the late 1920s for The 9th Earl of Bessborough, who served as the 14th Governor General of Canada in the early 1930s. The 9th Lord Bessborough sold the house in the late 1930s. Bessborough House now forms the main part of Kildalton Agricultural College. Education Piltown is also home to Ireland's largest Horticultural and Agricultural College, Kildalton College. Culture Host to Ireland's longest running agricultural show, called the Iverk Show, on the fourth Saturday in August each year. The Iverk Agricultural Show, started in 1826, was founded by a member of the Bessborough family. The family resided at Bessborough House, which is now Kildalton Agricultural College. This show has grown to become one of Ireland's largest one day Agricultural and Family shows. Sport Piltown GAA club was initially formed as far back as 1887 and then reformed in 1953. The Club played in two Senior County Finals in 1904 and 1910. The original grounds were purchased from the Land Commission in 1947. Piltown GAA club enjoyed one of its most successful years in 2003, winning the Southern Junior Hurling League (beating Tullogher Rosbercon), Southern Junior Hurling Championship (beating Tullogher Rosbercon), County Junior Hurling Championship (beating St. Patrick's Ballyragget after a replay), Leinster Junior Hurling Championship (beating St. Vincents of Dublin after extra-time) and were crowned AIB Kilkenny Club of the Year.

Since comets are believed to be the most primordial objects in the solar system, their study is of great importance to planetary science. At the time of the 1986 return (technically, \\"apparition\\") of the comet, astronomical telescopes and related instrumentation were vastly more sensitive than for any previous apparition. Consequently, the International Halley Watch (IHW) was organized to stimulate, standardize, collect, and archive observations of the comet. The initial plans were formulated by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where a Lead Center for western hemisphere observations was established with support from NASA; a corresponding Center for eastern hemisphere observations was funded by the Federal Republic of Germany at the Remeis Observatory (code 521) in Bamberg. An international Steering Group was established, and a set of Discipline Specialists was chosen to organize observing networks, coordinate their activity, and ultimately to collect and archive their data. This effort was endorsed by the International Astronomical Union in 1982, and cometary scientists were chosen as Discipline Specialists in the areas of Astrometry, Infrared Studies, Large Scale Phenomena, Near-Nucleus Studies, Photometry and Polarimetry, Radio Studies, Spectroscopy and Spectrophotometry, Meteor Studies, and Amateur Observations. The IHW also coordinated with the space missions to the comet, Giotto by the European Space Agency and Vega by the Soviet Union and collaborating countries.

In his early photographs, film, and installations post-communist Bulgaria and Bulgarian art is a recurrent theme. In his more recent work, Tcherkelov paints images from American and other national currencies using impasto, glaze, foil, acrylic and watercolor techniques. In all of his work the artist seeks to suggest the way in which symbolic images legitimize national power.Houben R. T.: All About the Benjamins. Artist's Statement. Stone Quarry Hill Art Park. Cazenovia, NY. April 22-May 12, 2007. Life and work Houben Tcherkelov was born on January 23, 1970, in Kardzhali, a town in southeastern Bulgaria. Tcherkelov studied painting at the National Academy of Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria's capital, and was associated with the radical movement around the XXL Gallery.Phillips, Christopher. \\"Report From Sofia: The View from Europe's Lower East Side.\\" Art in America. October, 1997. pg. 49. Tcherkelov's early works in Sofia analyze space and life structures in a society transitioning at once to a new social system and acclimating to the rapid pace of globalization. Freezing, a 1994 exhibit of frozen animals in Sofia's National Museum of Natural History (Bulgaria) pointed to the moribund state of museums in Bulgaria, grossly out-of-sync with the normal pace of events.Balkanski, Kamen. \\"Houben Tcherkelov: Interventions in various fields of life\\". Siksi. Winter, 1997. 81. Perhaps Tcherkelov's most well-known work from his series of interventions is Suitable Suit, a video still from which served as the cover of Menschenbilder: Foto- und Videokunst aus Bulgarien.Menschenbilder: Foto- und Videokunst aus Bulgarien. Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen. Berlin, Germany. 1997. In this video the artist lumbers through a field in a suit many sizes too large. Tcherkelov's analysis of Bulgarian society culminated in Reality Show (1998), a video that, with numerous art historical references, satirizes the affluence and decadence of the international film and music industry transferred to Sofia.Seidl, Walter. \\"Reality Show.\\" ROTOR. Graz, Austria. In 1995, Tcherkelov studied impasto painting with Jörg Immendorff in Amsterdam with a grant from the Felix Meritis Foundation.Houben R. T.: $ Paintings, 30. Not until he arrived in New York City in 2000, however, did he begin to work exclusively using this technique.Henry, 2. Art critic Eleanor Heartney, in an introduction to Tcherkelov's series of impasto paintings based on images from currency, writes that they present \\"symbols mined from American currency as keys to understand national dreams and fantasies.\\"Heartney, Eleanor. Houben R. T.: Recent Paintings. Introduction. DTR Modern Galleries. Boston/Palm Beach. 2. Concentrating on details in both new and old forms of money, Tcherkelov \\"exhumes their meanings and contradictions, revealing the subliminal power that currency images have.\\"Heartney, 1. Artist, musician, and performer Genesis P-Orridge writes of one of Tcherkelov's paintings that \\"it seemed to explode with sheer exuberance.\\" He continues: \\"We wonder how the artist trapped a living spirit inside the painting and yet maintained its happiness!\\".Russeth, Andrew. \\"Genesis Breyer P-Orridge in New York.\\" Artinfo. http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32578/genesis-breyer-p-orridge-in-new- york/?page=3. 18 September 2009. Tcherkelov cites the panic in the Bulgarian banking sector in the 1990s, which forced the government to devaluate the national currency, the Lev, by removing three zeroes, as the initial impetus that drove his consideration, from an aesthetic perspective, of the symbolic power of money.Karadzhova, Lilyana. \\"I paint money, I do not print banknotes.\\" Europost. http://www.europost.bg/bin/marticle?id=11280. 25 July 2014. He also points to his arrival in New York as an immigrant, and his reliance on coins to make calls from payphones, as having \\"left [him] with the feeling of communication,\\" and that money is a component of expression.\\"I am not an elitist artist.\\" Europost. http://www.europost.eu/article?id=4585. 12 May 2012. Cultural critic Georgette Gouveia notes that Houben's aesthetic \\"is related to 20th-century Pop Art, but rather than focus on manufactured Pepsi- Cola or Brillo boxes as Warhol famously did, he focuses on the financial instruments that are engines of wealth.\\"\\"Show me the Money, the New Art of the Deal/the Art of the New Deal: Art and Money in Contemporary Culture.\\" Lehman College Art Gallery.

Brown has also played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Jets, and Seattle Seahawks. Early years Brown was born in Wichita, Kansas. He attended Wichita High School East in Wichita, and played high school football for the Wichita East Blue Aces. As a sophomore and junior he was a consensus first-team Class 6A all-state selection and as a junior he was named to the Wichita Eagle \\"Second 11\\" all- state team. Brown registered 154 tackles (111 solo) and 7 sacks as a sophomore starter at linebacker in 2005, but also rushed for 462 yards at fullback. As a junior, Brown had 158 tackles, eight sacks and an interception. Brown attended the 2006 Oklahoma summer camp where he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 seconds. He also had an impressive performance at the 2007 U.S. Army Combine, and announced in June 2007 that he would participate in the 2008 U.S. Army All- American Bowl. Pete Carroll said that Brown was the best linebacker that he had seen in seven years—referring to D. J. Williams—, while Bob Stoops predicted Brown would win the Dick Butkus Award two times. Primarily because of the Brown brothers, ESPNU nationally televised a matchup between East and Dodge City High School on September 7, 2007. Following the 2007 season, USA Today recognized him as a high school All-American. =Recruiting= Brown was considered the top prospect to come out of Wichita since Barry Sanders and Kamerion Wimbley. In September 2007, Brown announced that the schools he planned to visit were Alabama, Louisiana State, North Carolina, Miami (FL), and Southern California.Kansas.com: East's Arthur Brown will visit Bama, LSU, UNC, Miami, USC Oklahoma, Kansas State, Georgia Tech, Florida, and Georgia, whom he had already visited, were still on his list of ten.

He decided to attend the University of Miami. College career Brown initially attended the University of Miami, and played for the Miami Hurricanes football team. He struggled during his freshman year despite being Miami's top-rated recruit. Hurricanes coach Randy Shannon decided to move Brown from weakside to inside linebacker for his sophomore season, saying he began flourishing in the new role toward the end of the 2008 season. \\"The last two weeks of the season he was phenomenal at middle linebacker on scout team.

In terms of editorial policy on theology, the Repository was largely concerned with rational dissent. Considered as a political journal, it was radical, supporting a platform of: abolition of monopolies (including the Corn Laws); abolition of slavery; repeal of \\"taxes on knowledge\\"; extension of suffrage; national education; reform of the Church of England; and changes to the Poor Laws. History The Monthly Repository was established when Robert Aspland bought William Vidler's Universal Theological Magazine and changed the name to the Monthly Repository of Theology and General Literature. Aspland edited the magazine until the end of 1826, when the paper was bought by the recently formed British and Foreign Unitarian Association. The \\"Cookites\\", the Methodist Unitarian movement founded by Joseph Cooke, was launched by an article in the Monthly Repository for May 1815. A second series of the magazine, now the Monthly Repository and Review of General Literature, was begun in January 1827: the Unitarian Association's Book Department, under Thomas Rees, took direct editorial control until William Johnson Fox was appointed editor in 1828. In 1831 Fox cut the magazine's explicit ties with Unitarianism by buying the paper, which had been making a loss, from the Association. He continued as editor- proprietor until 1836, when the magazine was briefly owned and edited by first Richard Henry Horne (1836–7) and then Leigh Hunt (1837–8).

It is an east–west route, running from PA 443 in Pine Grove in Schuylkill County east to and PA 248 in Bowmanstown in Carbon County. PA 895 is a two-lane undivided road that passes through rural areas in the southern sections of Schuylkill and Carbon counties, serving Auburn, Deer Lake, and New Ringgold. The entire course is close to the north flank of Blue Mountain. PA 895 was designated in 1928 between Auburn and U.S. Route 120 (US 120, now PA 61) in Pinedale. In the 1930s, the route was extended west to PA 443 in Pine Grove and east to US 309 at White Street in Bowmanstown. In 1961, the east end was moved to an interchange with the PA 29/PA 45 (now PA 248) freeway in Bowmanstown.  Route description  PA 895 westbound at the junction with PA 183 in Wayne Township PA 895 begins at an intersection with PA 443 in the borough of Pine Grove in Schuylkill County, heading east on two-lane undivided East Wood Street. The road runs through residential areas and curves southeast, crossing the Swatara Creek into Pine Grove Township. The route becomes an unnamed road and continues past a few homes, turning east and intersecting the northern terminus of PA 501 in Marstown. PA 895 runs through a mix of farm fields and woods with some homes a short distance to the north of Lower Little Swatara Creek on Rock Road, crossing into Washington Township. The road continues through rural land, passing through the community of Rock. Farther east, the route enters Wayne Township and becomes Fair Road, passing through the community of Moyers. PA 895 heads through agricultural areas, briefly turning north before making a turn back to the east. The road comes to an intersection with PA 183 a short distance to the west of the community of Summit Station. The route runs northeast through wooded areas with some fields and development parallel to Bear Creek. The roadway passes through Roeders and runs to the north of the Schuylkill County Fairgrounds before it crosses into South Manheim Township. PA 895 runs through the community of Jefferson and continues through rural areas before it crosses into the borough of Auburn. Here, the road becomes Market Street and is lined with homes. The route passes under a Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad line and enters West Brunswick Township, running through woods and coming to a bridge over the Schuylkill River and intersecting the Schuylkill River Trail. PA 895 heads northeast through rural areas with residential and commercial development, entering the borough of Deer Lake and reaching a junction with PA 61 that is controlled by jughandles. At this point, PA 895 turns east for a concurrency with PA 61 on Centre Turnpike, a four-lane divided highway with a Jersey barrier, passing through wooded areas with nearby residential neighborhoods. The road leaves Deer Lake for West Brunswick Township again, curving southeast and running through a mix of farm fields and woods. In the community of Molino, PA 895 splits from PA 61 at a jughandle-controlled intersection by turning northeast onto two-lane undivided Summer Valley Road. The road runs through farmland with some trees and homes a short distance to the west of the Little Schuylkill River and Blue Mountain. The route curves north and passes through the community of Millers before it enters East Brunswick Township and heads through Drehersville. PA 895 continues through rural land, curving west and back north before it heads northeast and intersects PA 443 east of the community of McKeansburg. Here, PA 443 joins PA 895 and the two routes run through wooded areas with some homes, curving east. The road crosses the Little Schuylkill River into the borough of New Ringgold and becomes Hughes Avenue, heading southeast past residences and businesses. The roadway bends east and crosses the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Reading Division line immediately before PA 443 turns north onto Railroad Avenue. PA 895 continues east along Hughes Avenue past homes before entering forests. The route leaves New Ringgold for East Brunswick Township again and becomes Summer Valley Road, passing through wooded areas with some fields and homes. The road bends to the northeast and crosses into West Penn Township, where it passes through the community of Kepner. PA 895 continues through rural areas and follows the Lizard Creek, reaching an intersection with PA 309 in the community of Snyders. Past this intersection, the route becomes Lizard Creek Road and runs parallel to the creek through agricultural areas with some woods and residences, serving the communities of Mantz and Andreas. The road crosses into East Penn Township in Carbon County and continues northeast through a mix of farm fields and forests with occasional homes, passing through the community of Ashfield. The roadway heads into more wooded areas and passes through the residential community of West Bowmans, where it comes to a bridge over Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension). After passing through West Bowmans, the route crosses the Lehigh River into the borough of Bowmanstown. Here, PA 895 becomes Lehigh Street and runs past homes and businesses for a block before ending at a right-in/right-out ramp with the eastbound direction of the PA 248 freeway. Access to and from the westbound direction of PA 248 is provided by Bank Street, which branches from PA 895 just past the Lehigh River and heads east to intersect the ramp from westbound PA 248 and White Street, the latter which leads to an entrance to westbound PA 248. History When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 895 was not given a number. PA 895 was designated in 1928 to run from Auburn northeast to US 120 (now PA 61) in Pinedale in along an unpaved road. The entire length of PA 895 was paved by 1930. At this time, the road west of Auburn was an unnumbered, unpaved road, while the road between Molino and Bowmanstown was an unnumbered road that was paved east of Andreas and unpaved west of there. In the 1930s, PA 895 was extended west from Auburn to PA 443 in Pine Grove and was extended east from US 122 (which had replaced US 120) in Pinedale to US 309 (White Street) in Bowmanstown. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved. In Bowmanstown, the route ran along Bank Street between the Lehigh River and US 309. In 1961, the eastern terminus of PA 895 was moved to its current location at an interchange with the newly constructed PA 29/PA 45 (now PA 248) freeway in Bowmanstown. In September 2012, a project began to widen and improve the stretch of PA 895 concurrent with PA 61 between Deer Lake and Molino into a four-lane divided highway; this project was completed in 2015.

Adriaan's brother, Peter (1678–1714), was an influential lawyer in Haarlem. Reland first studied Latin language in Amsterdam at age 11, and enrolled at University of Utrecht in 1693, at age 17, to study theology and philosophy. Initially interested in Hebrew and Syriac, he later began studying Arabic. In 1699, after obtaining his doctorate in Utrecht, Reland moved to Leiden and tutored the son of Hans Willem Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland. The latter invited him to move to England, but Reland declined because of his father's deteriorating health. Academic career In 1699, Reland was appointed Professor of Physics and Metaphysics at the University of Harderwijk. By this point, he had achieved fluency in Arabic, Hebrew, and other Semitic languages.Adriaan Reland (1676-1718) In 1701, at age 25, he was appointed Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Utrecht. Beginning in 1713, he also taught Hebrew Antiquities. This was extended with a Chair in Jewish Antiquity. Reland gained renown for his research in Islamic studies and linguistics; his work being an early example of comparative linguistics. Additionally, he studied Persian and was interested in the relation of Eastern myths to the Old Testament. He published a work concerning East Asian myths, Dissertationum miscellanearum partes tres, in 1708. Moreover, he discovered the link for the Malay language to the Western Pacific dictionaries of Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire. Research on Middle East Reland, through compiling Arabic texts, completed De religione Mohammedica libri duo in 1705. This work, extended in 1717, was considered the first objective survey of Islamic beliefs and practices. It quickly became a reference work throughout Europe and was translated into Dutch, English, German, French and Spanish. Reland also extensively researched Middle Eastern locations and biblical geography, taking interest in the Semitic peoples of Palestine. He published Antiquitates Sacrae veterum Hebraeorum (1708) and Palaestina ex monumentis veteribus illustrata (1714), in which he described and mapped the Biblical-era geography of Palestine. Reland retained his professorship for his entire life, and additionally became a noted poet. In 1718, at age 41, he died of smallpox in Utrecht.

Early years He was born in New York, New York. Biography by Bruce Eder, Allmusic.com. Retrieved 15 August 2015 In the early years of rock and roll, Randazzo played accordion with a group called The Three Chuckles and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show numerous times. Their first hit \\"Runaround\\", was a top 20 hit in 1954. The following year, he became the group's lead singer, and sang on their hits \\"Times Two, I Love You\\" and \\"And the Angels Sing\\". The records' success brought him to the attention of disc jockey Alan Freed, who featured him in the movie Rock, Rock, Rock. As a solo artist, he had three singles that made the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Little Serenade\\" (#66) in 1958, \\"The Way of a Clown\\" (#44) in 1960, and \\"Big Wide World\\" (#51) in 1963. He co-starred in rock revues staged by Freed, appearing with such artists as Chuck Berry and LaVern Baker. He also had roles in such rock films as Hey, Let's Twist!, The Girl Can't Help It, Rock, Rock, Rock and Mister Rock and Roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Hit-making years Randazzo wrote a string of major hits for other artists with composing partner, Bobby Weinstein,BMI and Songwriters Hall Of Fame including \\"Pretty Blue Eyes\\", a top ten hit for Steve Lawrence in the US and Craig Douglas in the UK in 1959. He wrote many songs for Little Anthony and the Imperials, producing and arranging several albums for the group in the mid-60s. The hit songs included \\"Goin' Out of My Head\\" (1964, #6 Pop, #22 R&B;), which was subsequently recorded by numerous artists including the Zombies; \\"Hurt So Bad\\" (1965, #10 Pop, #3 R&B;), which was recorded four years later by the Lettermen (#12 in 1969), and then by Linda Ronstadt who took it to #8 in 1980; and the Imperials' Top 20 hits, \\"I'm On The Outside (Looking In)\\" and \\"Take Me Back\\". The Lettermen combined \\"Goin' Out of My Head\\" with Frankie Valli's hit, \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" in a medley which reached #7 in 1968. Randazzo also wrote Little Anthony and the Imperials' \\"Yesterday Has Gone\\", which was recorded by UK band Cupid's Inspiration in 1968 and climbed to #4 in the UK pop chart; the song was also recorded in 1996 by Marc Almond and P. J. Proby. He arranged and produced two albums on MGM Records with Baltimore girl group the Royalettes, including the Top 50 hit \\"It's Gonna Take A Miracle\\" in 1965. He gave the group a big production sound with a full orchestra (compared to sparer instrumentation for Little Anthony recordings), but the group failed to achieve a major commercial success. Laura Nyro, teaming up with Philadelphia soul producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, recorded the song for her 1971 album, Gonna Take a Miracle, with background vocals for the album performed by Labelle. This Laura Nyro recording was featured in A Home at the End of the World (2004). \\"Miracle\\" was revived in 1982 by Deniece Williams, who took it to the #1 R&B; spot and #10 in the Hot 100. \\"I Want To Meet Him\\", the Royalettes' follow-up in 1966, reached the Hot 100 and the Top 30 R&B; charts. All of the 27 songs that Randazzo produced on the group's two albums, plus another issued on single, appeared on a CD retrospective of the Royalettes' complete MGM output released by UK label, RPM in late 2010. Many of Randazzo's tunes became pop classics, recorded by a gamut of industry giants from Ella Fitzgerald to Frank Sinatra. \\"I've lost count on how many versions there are\\", Randazzo once said of \\"Goin' Out Of My Head\\". It is now included in the Top 50 most recorded songs with sales of over 100 million by over 400 artists, according to the Songwriters' Hall Of Fame. Later, he provided several songs for albums by New York soul group, the Manhattans, during their 1970s' hey- day, including the 1977 hit, \\"It Feels So Good To Be Loved So Bad\\" (#6 R&B;, #66 Pop), \\"There's No Good In Goodbye\\", and \\"A Million To One\\". He also wrote and produced for the Stylistics. Albums include Fashionably Yours and Love Spell. At this time, Randazzo co-wrote songs with his then girlfriend Victoria Pike and songwriters Roger Joyce and Souren Mozian. During the early and mid 1960s, Randazzo toured extensively with his own band appearing at the Copacabana, New York, Hotel Americana, San Juan and regularly at the Thunderbird Hotel, Las Vegas. Band members included renowned musicians Larry Taylor, Gerry McGee, Tommy Boyce, Bobby Hart, Vince Megna, Billy Lewis, Kenny Rankin, Bobby Vincent, Bobby Weinstein, and Billy Barberis. Randazzo was especially popular in Hawaii where his early recordings had topped the local record charts. Later life and death Randazzo married R. Shelly Kunewa Honolulu Advertiser of Hawaii and divided his time between their home in the islands and their home in Florida for most of the latter half of his life. He continued writing and producing. Randazzo produced and arranged Keola & Kapono Beamer's Honolulu City Lights album for Tom Moffatt's Paradise Records Label. The title song was a hit and the album became a local classic in Hawaii. In 2004, the editors of Honolulu Magazine asked a panel of local recording industry veterans to rank their choices for the best Hawaii album \\"of all time.\\" Honolulu City Lights was chosen #1. Randazzo died at age 68 at his home in Orlando, Florida. He is survived by 7 children including his eldest son Teddy Randazzo Jr . from mother Caroline Randazzo .

Previously functioning as the second campus of the town's other high school, Madera High, the school officially became Madera's second official high school in August 2006. History In the late 1980s, the Madera Unified School District commissioned a new high school to be built, to take some of the weight off of Madera High School by easing up some of the overcrowding of the school. Construction started in 1990, but a limited budget forced an abrupt end in 1992. It was decided that the campus was not big enough to be counted as a separate stand-alone high school, and the site was eventually renamed Madera High School's \\"South Campus\\" (with the original school being given the new name \\"North Campus\\"). In November 2002, a school bond was passed, allowing MUSD to fund the completion of the project. As a result, the idea of a new, separate high school was once again possible after 10 years. Construction resumed on the campus in late 2004, yet heavy rain and other factors slowed it to a halt. The set date of August 2005 was pushed back a year, and as a result, the incoming freshmen at the school were still labeled as Madera High School students. However, by August 2006, construction had completed, and Madera South High School opened its doors. Courses Similar to Madera High School, Madera South High features many \\"career schools\\"—i.e., mini-schools located within the campus, customized for whichever career a student wishes to choose from. Current career schools include: *Agriculture *Business/Human Services (originally two separate career schools prior to 2006) *Humanities (performing arts, etc.) *Health Sciences Athletics Madera South High School offers many athletic opportunities.

The Madera FFA Chapter was founded at the same time as the National FFA Organization in 1928. Since then Madera FFA has experienced years of excellence. First graduating class In 2009, Madera South graduated their first class as a high school. Even though the Class of 2009 was mixed with Madera High students their freshman year (2005–2006), the two schools were completely separated by their senior year (2008–2009)  New high school  In late 2008, Madera Unified bought land for a new high school in the northern part of town, and the school was to be named Madera North High School. Madera North is scheduled to be completed in August 2019. As of early 2017, the Madera Unified school board has chosen to have a public vote upon a name for the school rather than the previously chosen name \\"Madera North High School.\\" A complete list of names will be presented to the Board of Trustees on May 23, 2017, and a public hearing will also be held.

It also states that she is Meg McGinty's friend. = Engineers = ;Miss Weaver :The head of the school, which she built mostly herself. She teaches Clockwork Robotics as a subject. She is extremely cold and cruel towards students, and is rarely ever threatened by anyone. It is revealed that all engineers were once human 80 years ago. However, she had an illness that was incurable, and as she was dying, she decided to give her and the rest of the staff robotics bodies to extend their lifespan. Her husband, Doctor Bleak, was her first test subject whose soul was successfully transferred into a clockwork box. She announced the fact that her \\"experiment\\" worked, and she now needs more test subjects. She tells the students they did horribly on their mid-term tests, and changes to rule to two students being sent to the windmill each week. It was revealed that her full name is Eleanor Weaver. ;Miss Notch :The school maid. She was the one who allowed Lucy to enter Hollow Fields, and let her sign a contract, becoming Hollow Field's property until graduation. She is cheerful and busy, but is rather dark and cruel when it comes to disciplining children. When she was human, she was the young, and loyal maid of Miss Weaver. It was revealed that her full name is Emily Notch. ;Miss Ricketts :The youngest and kindest teacher, favored by students. She teaches Cross-Species Body-Part Transplantation and Bio-Steam Graphing, and is also the school nurse. Her office is the hospital wing. In volume two, it is revealed that she is the one who created clockwork bodies for the Engineers. They visit her weekly for check-ups, as they are falling apart. ;Mister Croach :The teacher of Grave Robbing, Live Taxidermy and Embalming. In other words, he creates any living creatures concerning dead flesh. He is strict and short-tempered, often rushing and frightening children. His full name is Archibald Croach Jr., and before joining Miss Weaver, he worked with his father at Croach and Croach Jr \\"Steam-Driven Solutions\\". He strongly dislikes children, and does not like to be in contact with other people. ;Stinch :He is the school warden, created by Miss Weaver to be the perfect watchdog. However, as Miss Weaver is weak with creating anything from things other than clockwork, he has limited knowledge. He does whatever he can to catch students doing something wrong, and drags them to detention. His real gender, age, and race are unknown to everyone; it is said the closest possible gender for Stinch would be male. Lucy described him as looking like \\"he lost a fight with a sewing machine\\". = Others = ;Doctor Artemis/Atticus Normandy Bleak :He is called \\"Doctor Bleak\\" for short. He is a box with clockwork inside, which Lucy smuggles around the school. He tutors Lucy on all her subjects and even gives her hints on how to escape the school. Doctor Bleak is held hostage after being discovered by Miss Weaver, and Lucy and Claude are sent to detention. When he was still human, Miss Weaver, who used to be his wife, used him as her first experiment subject by putting his soul into the box that he is right now. In the first volume, he says his name is Atticus Normandy Bleak, although Miss Weaver once called him Artemis. Production Madeleine Rosca wanted to write a story which could appeal to both children and adults and that featured \\"a female protagonist\\" and \\"a steampunk-influenced setting\\". The concept of the series \\"gradually evolved over several months\\". Children's books such as A Series of Unfortunate Events and Artemis Fowl, that combined \\"fantasy/horror themes with comedy and had a broad appeal\\" inspired Hollow Fields, though she noted some \\"manga and comic influences\\" in her overall work. Rosca enjoyed drawing Lucy and her \\"big range of expressions\\" as well as Miss Notch and her \\"prim mannerisms\\". She began the series in 2004 and by mid-2005, \\"had a cohesive version\\". She published Hollow Fields on the \\"online webmanga community\\" Wirepop in November 2005 and three days later, Seven Seas Entertainment offered to publish Hollow Fields in North America. Seven Seas Entertainment released the three volumes of Hollow Fields from July 2007 to January 2009, and reprinted the series in an omnibus collection () on October 2009. =Volume list= Reception Hollow Fields was well received by critics. Ben Leary of Mania Entertainment called it \\"a good, clean, fun, and inventive read\\" with \\"cleanly organized\\" and \\"attractive\\" art. PopCultureShock's Katherine Dacey praised the art as \\"crisply appealing\\", which is \\"as good if not better than the artwork in many licensed series, employing the visual tropes of shonen manga to tell a story that would resonate equally with Frances Hodgson Burnett and Hayao Miyazaki fans\\"; however, Dacey also commented on the plot as \\"a bit derivative, borrowing elements from Lemony Snickett and Harry Potter not to mention Castle in the Sky and Steamboy\\" and wished for \\"a consistent tone\\" in the story. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime described it as \\"a remarkable debut\\" and \\"a rich fantasy of fertile imagination that will appeal to fans of Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket’s Series of Unfortunate Events\\". Ellingwood also commended the \\"immersing style with a highly attractive quality\\" of the artwork. Aint It Cool News's Scott Green wrote \\"Hollow Fields serves as a welcome, boisterous counter-point to post-Potter magical school fiction\\" and noted that it \\"does not closely conform to prominent the features of manga, or for that matter, western comics.\\" About.com's Deb Aoki picked Hollow Fields as \\"2007's Best New OEL Manga\\", and Dacey listed it as an honourable mention in her list of the ten best global manga. Rosca was one of four winners presented with Japan’s first ever \\"International Manga Award\\" for her work on Hollow Fields.

The sonata was written for and dedicated to Auguste Franchomme. The sonata is remarkable for the concentration of its material: much of the music of the first movement grows out of the cello’s opening statement, and certain theme-shapes appear in all its movements. The last three movements were first publicly performed by Franchomme and Chopin at the composer's last public concert, at the Salle Pleyel on 16 February 1848.

Like all his novels, it is set in Florida. The themes of the novel include corruption, environmentalism, exploitation of endangered species, and animal rights.  Synopsis  Joe Winder, a former investigative reporter, now works for the public relations department of the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills, a theme park located on North Key Largo, Florida. Joe's dulled investigative instincts are roused by the theft of two endangered \\"Blue Tongued Mango Voles\\" from the park's rare animal pavilion. Winder's boss, Charles Chelsea, discourages him from looking into the theft, but Joe secretly questions Dr. Will Koocher, the young biologist hired to supervise the captive breeding of the voles. The Amazing Kingdom's founder and owner is Francis X. Kingsbury, f.k.a. Frankie King, a convicted racketeer who relocated to Florida under the Witness Protection Program after testifying against several mid-level members of John Gotti's crime family. Having discovered a previously unknown talent for selling real estate, Frankie has become very wealthy after building the Kingdom. His next project is to build Falcon Trace, an enormous golf course and vacation resort near the park, blatantly ignoring the proximity of a federal wildlife preserve. The theft of the voles was commissioned by Molly McNamara, the elderly founder of a small environmentalist group called the Mothers of Wilderness. Unfortunately, the two burglars she hired, Bud Schwartz and Danny Pogue, carelessly kill both voles during the getaway. Furious, Molly gives both of the burglars non-fatal gunshot wounds and forcibly recruits them into the group. Meanwhile, Joe, who opposes Falcon Trace, keeps investigating the theft of the voles. The day after Will disappears, the Kingdom's trained orca suddenly dies. During the autopsy, Will's dead body is found lodged in the whale's throat. Joe refuses to let go of his suspicions of foul play, and the Kingdom's security chief, Pedro Luz, catches him searching Will's office for clues. Charlie decides to fire Joe, but not before Joe reveals he's uncovered the motive for Will's murder: a bottle of blue food coloring hidden in the vole lab, meaning Will had discovered that the \\"endangered\\" voles were fake and was silenced before he could expose the hoax. Meanwhile, Molly sends Bud and Danny to burglarize Frankie's office at the Kingdom, looking for proof of illegal activities connected with Falcon Trace. Among Frankie's private files, Bud finds news clippings and correspondence showing his true identity as a former mafioso. Unknown to Molly, he and Danny approach Frankie and blackmail him for the return of the files. Frightened of the mob's retaliation, Frankie promises them a large sum. Bud and Danny are elated, but return to Molly's condominium to find her savagely beaten - Frankie sent Pedro to give her \\"a warning\\" after her group picketed the opening ceremony of Falcon Trace. Joe's girlfriend Nina leaves him after he loses his job, but he finds allies in Carrie Lanier, an actress who plays one of the Kingdom's animal characters, and \\"Skink\\", who lives wild in the Key Largo woods. Both men agree that the law can do little to punish Frankie for Will's murder. Joe sabotages equipment at the Falcon Trace construction site and, with Carrie's encouragement, issues phony press releases about disease outbreaks and poisonous snakes at the park. Charlie counters each of these releases, while Pedro unsuccessfully tries to kill Joe. Under Skink's guidance, Joe and Carrie also meet and compare notes with Molly, Bud, and Danny, leading Joe to learn of Frankie's true identity. When Bud and Danny appear to exchange Francis's files for their blackmail money, Pedro and one of his security guards try to kill them instead. The burglars escape, and an enraged Bud tracks down a mid- ranking Gotti associate to inform him of Frankie's whereabouts. A mob hit man is sent down, but his shot accidentally wounds the golf pro standing next to Frankie. Disguised in Carrie's animal costume, Joe enters the park and, with Bud and Danny's help, confronts Frankie in his office. Joe offers him a graceful way out of his troubles, giving him a press release announcing that he will cancel Falcon Trace for environmentally conscious reasons. Joe reminds Frankie that he obtained the permits for Falcon Trace using a false name, and that his exposure will doom both the park and the development while putting Frankie in violation of his probation for defrauding the government and hiring convicted felons as security guards. As Frankie considers taking Joe's offer, Pedro bursts in, disarms Joe, and marches him out of the office. Frankie orders him killed. Skink rescues Joe from a brutal beating and pitches Pedro into the whale tank, where he drowns while being raped by a bottlenose dolphin. Skink rejects Joe's subtle approach in favor of burning the Kingdom down. After the two men watch Carrie's first and last performance as the star of the Kingdom's Jubilee parade, Skink trips the park's fire alarm and causes the tourists and employees to flee. As Frankie tries in vain to find his security detail, he is shot dead in his office by the hit man, posing as a tourist. Joe and Carrie escape the burning park on foot while Molly, Danny, and Bud watch the proceedings on the television in her hospital room. In the epilogue, Falcon Trace is acquired by outside investors with plans to continue the development, but the project is halted when the Mothers of Wilderness report a sighting of two more of the presumed-extinct voles in the nearby woods. The land, and the remains of the Amazing Kingdom, are replanted and eventually incorporated into the nearby nature preserve. Characters *Joe Winder: The protagonist of the book. He works in public relations for The Amazing Kingdom, and was formerly an investigative reporter. *Carrie Lanier: Winder's love interest. An aspiring actress who currently plays one of the animal characters at the Amazing Kingdom. *Charles Chelsea: Vice President of public relations for The Amazing Kingdom, and Winder's immediate boss. A true spin doctor, he is so terrified of Kingsbury's displeasure that he will cover up anything remotely unpleasant that happens at the Kingdom. *Pedro Luz: The fitness-obsessed head of security at The Amazing Kingdom, a corrupt ex- policeman who combines steroids with an IV drip. *Molly McNamara: The seemingly 'sweet' old lady who hires two former robbers to steal the voles. She is a member of the Mothers of Wilderness, a fictional environmentalist group whose highly funded work usually comes to nothing. *Bud Schwartz and Danny Pogue: The two burglars hired by Molly. *Skink, otherwise known as Clinton Tyree: Former Governor of Florida. After giving up faith in the political system he decides to live in the Everglades. He always wears a shower cap and an electronic tracking device he found on a wild Florida panther (leading to the appearance of the trackers at the climax). Skink saves Joe's life on more than one occasion and is instrumental at the ending of the book. *Francis X. Kingsbury: The owner of the \\"Amazing Kingdom of Thrills\\" and a convicted felon, is a member of the Witness Protection Program after grassing on some mobsters in order to preserve himself.  References to actual history, science, or current events  *Kingsbury conceived the \\"Mango Vole\\" scam as a way of competing with Walt Disney World's much-lauded (though ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to repopulate the now-extinct dusky seaside sparrow. *The \\"Mango Voles\\" were actually cosmetically altered pine voles (Microtus pitymys); far from being endangered, as Kingsbury's accomplice tells him, they are classified as a species of least concern because of their abundance. *Skink admits to secret dreams of breaking into Riker's Island prison in New York State and killing Mark David Chapman, the man who murdered John Lennon, the lead singer for The Beatles. Skink and Winder both discuss The Dakota hotel, the scene of Lennon's murder. *Winder is saddened that Carrie, unlike him, cannot clearly remember the circumstances of Lennon's murder, and she defends that she was only fourteen years old when it happened, and, moreover, \\"it's easy to lose track of these idiots,\\" naming other emotionally disturbed gunmen who have become famous, such as Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan and John Hinckley; *The Amazing Kingdom's nightly parade is based loosely on the history of Florida, making lighthearted, bloodless references to historical figures such as Juan Ponce de León, the pirate Black Caesar, and the Seminole chief Osceola, and events such as the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926. It also deliberately excludes mention of such episodes as the slaughter of French Huguenots at Fort Caroline in 1565 (\\"It would have been difficult to find a musical score suitable to accompany a mass disemboweling...\\") *Several real-life pro golfers are named as contemporaries of Kingsbury's pro, Jake Harp, including Ben Hogan, Jack \\"The Bear\\" Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, Arnold \\"Arnie\\" Palmer, Lee \\"The Mex\\" Trevino, Greg \\"The Shark\\" Norman, and Billy Casper. *Kingsbury wears a variety of hairpieces to conceal his baldness, imitating the hairstyles of persons such as Kenny Rogers and Jack Kemp.  Connections with Hiaasen's other works  *Skink and his best friend Jim Tile reappear after their introduction in Double Whammy. *Hiaasen's book Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World collects a series of essays castigating Walt Disney World, and the Disney Company in general, for their reality-distorting brand of entertainment and their corporate greed. The fictional \\"Amazing Kingdom\\" acts as a thinly veiled parody of Disney World, a theme park run by a fugitive ex-mobster whose sole motivation for providing family entertainment is that it is amazingly lucrative, and who will go to any lengths, including murder, to protect it. *In Hiaasen's debut novel, Tourist Season, one of the civic leaders discussing Miami's response to a new eco- terrorist group operating in South Florida laments, \\"why doesn't this kind of shit ever happen to Disney World?\\" Hiaasen expands on this theme in Native Tongue, declaring that South Florida business and civic leaders blame Disney World for diverting the family tourist trade to Orlando, and greeted Kingsbury's proposal for a competitive theme park with instant, roaring approval. *One of the most disgraceful floats in the Amazing Kingdom's nightly parade is entitled \\"Migrants on a Mission,\\" portraying cheerful Caribbean farm workers dancing in Florida's sugar cane fields; Hiaasen's subsequent novel, Strip Tease, focuses on the sugar cane industry's exploitation of migrant labor, and the workers' squalid living conditions. *Warren Zevon is named as one of Joe Winder's favorite rock musicians; Zevon was a long-time friend of Hiaasen, and the two collaborated on the lyrics for the song \\"Basket Case,\\" which appeared in Hiaasen's subsequent novel of the same name and Zevon's 2002 album My Ride's Here.

Said to have been the younger son of one Patrick Vaus (died 1392), he apparently held \\"church livings\\" in Galloway as early as 1421.Dowden, Bishops, p. 244. He is found in possession of the precentorship of Dornoch Cathedral, seat (cathedra) of the diocese of Caithness, when a papal mandate from Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, 25 July 1398, authorised his appointment as Archdeacon of Caithness: > To William de Gerland and Thomas de Edname, canons of Caithness, and the > official of Caithness.

He may have held this archdeaconry for as many as nine years,Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 71, 252. until he was provided as Bishop of Orkney by Pope Benedict XIII sometime between the date of the above letter and 7 November 1408, probably close to the latter date.McGurk (ed.), Calendar of Papal Letters, p. 166; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 252. It is not clear if he ever obtained possession of the bishopric of Orkney, being opposed by the nominee of the Roman pope, probably John Pak of Colchester, and by the King of Norway with Orkney's metropolitan, the Archbishop of Trondheim.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 252. A letter from the Avignon pope, dated 12 February 1408, granted faculty to Alexander to be consecrated as Bishop of Orkney by three other bishops, \\"without prejudice to the archbishop of Nidaros to whom Orkney is accustomed to be subject\\".McGurk (ed.), Calendar of Papal Letters, p. 170; the Archbishop of Nidaros (Trondheim) was allied to the Roman, rather than the Avignon pope. Alexander does not appear to have been consecrated by the time he was provided, on 4 May 1414, to the bishopric of Caithness.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 60, 252. Alexander received from the Pope an indult for local consecration, dated 22 January 1415,McGurk (ed.), Calendar of Papal Letters, p. 309. and although the act of consecration itself is unrecorded, he was certainly consecrated by 16 January 1419, when he appeared for the first time as full bishop in a Melrose Abbey document.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 60. He was Bishop of Caithness for around eight years, before being translated again, on 4 December 1422, to become Bishop of Galloway.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 60, 131. His translation occurred while Alexander was present at the papal see, following the death of Bishop Thomas de Buittle.Dowden, Bishops, p. 368. Alexander was told by the papacy to take the oath of fealty to the Pope Martin V in the presence of the Bishop of Glasgow and the Bishop of Dunkeld.Dowden, Bishops, pp. 244-5, 368. He held the bishopric of Galloway for nearly twenty- eight years. Little of Vaus' activities as Bishop of Galloway, like any of the sees that he held are particularly well documented. He witnessed a charter of Margaret, Duchess of Touraine and Countess of Douglas, at \\"Treyff\\", on 26 November 1426, and on 22 September 1429. He attended the Perth parliament of 10 March 1430. He is found again in the Register of the Great Seal on 24 July and again on 6 September 1444. He resigned the see to Thomas Spens on 8 January 1450.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 131. The later historian Hector Boece related that Bishop Vaus had gone to a great deal of effort to enable Spens to succeed him. Vaus seems to have lived for some time after his voluntary resignation of the see of Galloway, as it was said by Boece that Spens refrained from being styled as lord or bishop in the presence of the elderly Vaus.

The headquarters was in London. The journal ended publication in 1826. High-church review The Society for the Reformation of Principles, founded in 1792 by William Jones of Nayland and William Stevens, established the British Critic in 1793. Robert Nares and William Beloe, editor and assistant editor respectively, were joint proprietors with the booksellers and publishers Francis and Charles Rivington. It was started as a monthly, but in 1825 its frequency was shifted to quarterly. Nares and Beloe edited the review for about 20 years. Around 1811 the magazine was bought by Joshua Watson and Henry Handley Norris, associated with the high-church pressure group known as the Hackney Phalanx. After 1825 the review \\"became more narrowly theological in scope\\". Tractarian takeover The owners were, however, in some difficulty in controlling the editorial line under both Campbell and Boone; and turned eventually to Oxford Movement figures. This move was brought on by the financial losses the Critic was making by 1836. John Henry Newman offered a stable of Oxford writers who would write reviews gratuitously, at a moment when the publisher was considering closing the publication.Skinner pp. 38–9. By the end of 1837 Newman was objecting to Boone's decisions and line (the use of Joseph Sortain as reviewer and the sympathy shown to Renn Dickson Hampden).Skinner, p. 40. Boone resigned by November, and Samuel Roffey Maitland took over; but he was immediately discomfited in early 1838 by a review by Edward Pusey relating to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners which placed him in a difficult personal position, and resigned.Skinner, p. 42–4. Until 1843 the Critic was then effectively dominated by the Tractarian movement, and edited successively by Newman and Thomas Mozley.S. A. Skinner, 'Newman, the Tractarians and the British Critic, Journal of Ecclesiastical History (1999), 50: 716–759 Under Mozley's editorship the Critic was strongly partisan, attacking Godfrey Faussett, and allowing Frederick Oakeley and W. G. Ward a free hand. It was closed down in October 1843. In 1844 a replacement publication, the English Review, was set up, by a group including John Kaye, with Rivingtons as published; it appeared to 1853. List of editors *1811 Thomas Fanshaw Middleton.

The route follows the path of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark as they explored the Louisiana Purchase and the Pacific Northwest. Route The Lewis & Clark Bicycle Trail starts in Hartford, Illinois, close to where the Lewis and Clark Expedition began in St. Charles, Missouri. Since the expedition traveled primarily by boat, the bicycle route follows their path along the Missouri and Columbia rivers as much as possible. The route has 4,589 mapped miles and includes a number of optional spurs, detours, and even Clark’s eastbound return path after the expedition had split into two parties at Traveler’s Rest in Lolo, Montana. The more historically accurate route, though, is 3,143 miles.  Terrain  The main route varies from paved roads, bike paths, unpaved rail trails, and gravel roads. The route’s elevation varies from flat plains to hilly sections in the mountains.  Logistics  Rough, gravel roads along the route may require off-road tires. A water filter may be necessary as many of the campsites are primitive, and the route can be ridden from May through September. Sponsors The Lewis & Clark Bicycle Trail was recognized by the National Council of the Lewis & Clark Bicentennial as part of the nationwide celebration.

It should not be confused with vulnerability, which takes into account both the effect of exposure and the likelihood of exposure. For example, a plant species may be highly susceptible to a particular plant disease, meaning that exposed populations invariably become extinct or decline heavily. However, that species may not be vulnerable if it occurs only in areas where exposure to the disease is unlikely, or if it occurs over such a wide distribution that exposure of all populations is unlikely. Conversely, a plant species may show low susceptibility to a disease, yet may be considered vulnerable if the disease is present in every population.

It consists of tripwire around the area, linked to one or more flares. When the tripwire is triggered, as by someone unsuspectingly disturbing it, the flare is activated and begins burning. The light from the flare simultaneously warns that the perimeter may have been breached and also gives light for investigating. In defensive operations, tripflares are usually placed in predetermined kill zones with machine guns sighted on them. United States military tripflares are issued with a fuze resembling that found on the M67 grenade. The difference is that the tripflare uses a pull fuse. This type of fuse detonates the flare immediately following spoon release. Also the pin does not have either the ring, or the split pin of other grenades. Instead it is double ended, one end acts as a safety clipping into both sides of the fuse body, while the other side is a straight pin allowing for easy removal. The flare is shipped with a metal mounting bracket that allows the grenade shaped flare to be mounted on a stake, tree, or other vertical service. One end of the bracket has a point allowing it to be driven into the ground, while the other end has a spring loaded spoon holder that allows for two way release. The soldier installing the flare can use this feature to set up the tension so that if the trip wire is detected and cut the flare still ignites.

Rasamanikkanar historical research centre, Trichy recently on the ancient Tamil inscription found in a dilapidated temple in this area as per the article published in the Kalki Tamil Magazine. This article mentions that this temple belongs to the 13th century A.D. and the inscription is deciphered thus – This village was called Kelundagam during this period and was a trading outpost to the traders and merchants carrying goods eastwards towards Madurai (Capital of Pandyan Kingdom - Pandyan dynasty). The inscription further states that a group of eighteen merchants guild was responsible for collection of taxes from the traders transporting goods. The tax money thus collected had to be spent for the upkeep of the Lord Siva temple (Madurai Udaya Eswaran - மதுரை உதய ஈஸ்வரன்) and the Lord Vishnu temple (Thiru Kannudaya Vinnagaram - திரு கண்ணுடைய விண்ணகரம்) found in this area near the confluence of the rivers Vaigai and Manjalaru. The article has published the photographs of the old temple walls. The article mentions about a very rare sculpture in the outer temple wall that depicts the capital punishment meted out to the criminals during that age. The study mentions that these types of paintings are also found in Madurai Meenakshi temple . Thus, this is connected to the Pandyan Kingdom due to the name of the Lord Siva temple (Madurai Udaya Eswaran) and also the sculpture resembling Pandya architecture. The study mentions that it could not read the entire inscription as the walls are submerged underground. As this area was near the confluence of the rivers Vaigai (also called Vegavathy in this region) and Manjalaru, locals refer to this area as \\"Mukkuttuthurai\\" which means a port. From the study, this port served the local merchants to transport goods to the capital city of the Pandyan Kingdom which is Madurai. The river is called Vegavathy (fast flowing river) as it gushes downwards from the Varushanad Valley. This helps in navigation and transportation of goods through boats in the Pandyan Kingdom.Srirangam Thirunavukkarasu.

The Pandyan dynasty is described in detail in the articles of Wikipedia through the ages – Pandyan dynasty . As per the historical records,K.A.N. Sastri. (Reprinted 1998). A History of South India from the Early Times to the Fall of Vijayanagar, Oxford University Press, New Delhi.. this area may have been ruled by various Pandyan Kings from Maravarman Sundara Pandyan, Sundaravarman Kulasekaran II through Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan who ruled Madurai till late 13th Century AD. The early part of the 14th century saw the gradual decline of the Pandya dynasty resulting in the repeated invasions of the South Indian Kingdoms by the Delhi Sultanate. Ala-ud-din Khilji of the slave dynasty from Delhi dispatched his general, Malik Kafur, in 1310. Malik Kafur marched south, ransacking kingdoms in central and Southern India on the way to Madurai . He marched into Madurai, sacking the town, paralysing trade, suppressing public worship, and making civilian life miserable. The great Meenakshi temple with its fourteen towers was pulled down, destroying the nearby streets and buildings, and leaving only the two shrines of Sundaresvara and Meenakshi intact. Sultan dynasty (Madurai Sultanate) was soon established at Madurai, ruling Madurai for around 50 years during the 14th century. This period was a dark period for Madurai Meenakshi temple ( Meenakshi Amman Temple) in Tamil Nadu as there was no puja during this period and the idol of Goddess Meenakshi was taken out of the city. During this period, most of South India came under the Delhi sultanate rule. The Vijayanagar empire (Vijayanagara Empire) under Bukka Raya I made a series of efforts to conquer Southern India and re-establish a Hindu Kingdom. It is to be noted that this king was blessed by the 12th Sringeri Peetadhipathi Saint Vidyaranya (1380-1386) of Sringeri Sarada Peetam in these efforts. There were a series of Vijayanagar invasions in the middle of the fourteenth century which succeeded in initially restricting and finally ending the Madurai Sultanate's rule over Madurai.Vijayanagar's armies were led by Bukka's son Kumara Kampanna Udaiyar and Veera Savanan. They defeated and killed Muslim ruler Hassan Gangu in 1371. Thus, the Sultan rule of the region was overthrown by the new Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, which had been founded at Hampi. For the next two centuries, this empire withstood repeated Sultan invasions from the north. Kampana Udaiyar started a dynasty, subordinate to the court of Vijayanagar that lasted for two centuries. The immediate effect of this victory was the reopening of the Siva and Vishnu temples in the cities of Madurai, Srirangam, Chidambaram and Kanchipuram in the southern region. The rule was continued by Vijayanagar-appointed governors who had \\"Nayaka\\" as a title. King Krishna Devaraya (1509–1529), the greatest ruler of the Vijayanagar dynasty, exercised close control over this part of his empire. Nagama Nayaka was the officer of Vijayanagara king Krishnadeva raya ruling Madurai and was followed by Viswanatha Nayaka. (see Madurai Nayak dynasty for more information.) The Nayaka dynasty was formally started by Viswanatha Nayaka in Madurai. The Madurai Nayaks (Madurai Nayak dynasty) were rulers from around 1529 until 1736, of a region comprising most of modern-day Tamil Nadu, India, with Madurai as their capital.The Nayak reign was an era noted for its achievement in arts, cultural and administrative reforms, revitalization of temples previously ransacked by the Delhi Sultans, and inauguration of a unique architectural style. The Pandyan kingdom was divided into 72 palayams by the King Viswanatha Nayaka (1529-1563) and his minister Ariyanatha Mudaliar. Viswanatha Nayaka and Ariyanatha Mudaliar rebuilt and renovated the Madurai Meenkashi temple along with the thousand pillared hall. The period of Sri Sachchidananda Bharati I was during the 17th century under the reign of Nayak dynasty of Madurai as per Madurai Nayak dynasty under the two Nayak kings Muttu Virappa Nayaka (1609—1623) and Tirumalai Nayaka (1623—1659). The foreword written by Shri K.R Venkatraman, editor of Sankara Krupa in the biography of Sri Sachchidananda Bharati I mentions about this history of Madurai also and the renovation of Madurai Meenakshi temple by the Kings Muttu Virappa Nayaka and Thirumala Nayak under the minister-ship of Shri Neelakanda Deekshithar. The period of the King Muthu Veerappa Naikar (1609-1623) was during the childhood of Sri Sachidananda Bharathi-I. Sri Sachidananda Bharathi-I stayed in Madurai as a Brahmachari for some time. During this period, the kambathadi mandapam and vasantharaya mandapam were completed by this king. During the period of Thirumalai Nayaka (1623–59), Sri Sachidananda Bharathi-I was ordained as the peetadhipathi of Sringeri Sarada Peetam. His minister Neelakanta Deekshitharhttp://www.palamadai.in/foundation/index- foundation.html built the pudu mandapam and reestablished the pujas for the deities in the Madurai Meenakshi temple as per the puranas like \\"Haalaasya Mahatmiyam\\" and agama rules.

The contemporary writer Lucian reports that he was an utter fraud – the god Glycon was supposedly constructed out of a glove puppet. The vivid narrative of his career given by Lucian might be taken as fictitious but for the corroboration of certain coins of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus AureliusJoseph Hilarius Eckhel, Doctrma Nummorum veterum, ii. pp. 383, 384 and of a statue of Alexander, said by Athenagoras to have stood in the forum of Parium. This cites: *Lucian, *Samuel Dill, Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius (1904) *F. Gregorovius, The Emperor Hadrian, trans. by M. E. Robinson (1898).Athenagoras, Apology, There is further evidence from inscriptions.See Dessau, Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae, nos 4079-80 Lucian describes him as having swindled many people and engaged, through his followers, in various forms of thuggery.\\"Alexander the False Prophet,\\" translated with annotation by A. M. Harmon, Loeb Classical Library, 1936. The strength of Lucian's venom against Alexander is attributed to Alexander's hate of the Epicureans. Lucian admired the works of Epicurus, a eulogy of which concludes the piece, and whether or not Alexander was the master of fraud and deceit as portrayed by Lucian, he may not have been too different from other oracles of the age, when a great deal of dishonest exploitation occurred in some shrines.Nuttall Costa, Charles Desmond, Lucian: Selected Dialogues, p. 129, Oxford University Press (2005), 0-199-25867-8  Biography  Not much is known about the early life of Alexander. He apparently worked in travelling medicine shows around Greece and might have been a prophet of the goddess Soi or a follower of Apollonius of Tyana. In Lucian, his partner in profession is given as one Cocconas of Byzantium. After a period of instruction in medicine by a doctor who also, according to Lucian, was an impostor, in about 150 CE he established an oracle of Aesculapius at his native town of Abonoteichus (femin.: Ἀβωνότειχος Abōnóteichos; later Ionopolis), on the Euxine, where he gained riches and great prestige by professing to heal the sick and reveal the future.Masson, John, Lucretius, Epicurean and Poet, pp. 339-340, John Murray (1907).Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913 Sometime before 160 CE Alexander formed a cult around the worship of a new snake-god, Glycon, and headquartered it in Abonoteichus. Having circulated a prophecy that the son of Apollo was to be born again, he contrived that there should be found in the foundations of the temple to Aesculapius, then in course of construction at Abonoteichus, an egg in which a small live snake had been placed. In an age of superstition no people had so great a reputation for credulity as the Paphlagonians, and Alexander had little difficulty in convincing them of the second coming of the god under the name of Glycon. A large tame snake with a false human head, wound round Alexander's body as he sat in a shrine in the temple,Frankfurther, David, Ritual Expertise in Roman Egypt and the Problem of the Category of Macician, in Schäfer, Peter and Kippenberg, Hans Gerhard, Envisioning Magic: A Princeton Seminar and Symposium, p. 115, BRILL (1997), gave \\"autophones\\", or oracles unasked. The numerous questions asked of the oracle were answered by Alexander in metrical predictions. In his most prosperous year he is said to have delivered nearly 80,000 replies, concerning bodily, mental, and social afflictions, for each of which he received a drachma and two oboli. Bronze coin of Antoninus Pius minted in Abonoteichos and showing the snake god Glycon with the legend “ΓΛVΚΩΝ ΑΒΩΝΟΤΕΙΧΕΙΤΩΝ” (29 mm, 16.89 g) Healing instructions were commonly combined with oracles, but Alexander did more; he instituted mysteries like those of Eleusis. Through the cult Alexander achieved a certain level of political influence – his daughter married Publius Mummius Sisenna Rutilianus, the governor of the Roman province of Asia. He found believers from Pontus to Rome through pretended arts of soothsaying and magic and was revered and consulted as a prophet by many notable individuals of his age.Neander, Johann August W, General history of the Christian religion and Church (1850), p. 41. During the plague of 166 a verse from the oracle was used as an amulet and was inscribed over the doors of houses as a protection and an oracle was sent, at Marcus Aurelius' request, by Alexander to the Roman army on the Danube during the war with the Marcomanni, declaring that victory would follow on the throwing of two lions alive into the river. The result was a great disaster and Alexander had recourse to the old quibble of the Delphic oracle to Croesus for an explanation. His main opponents were Epicureans and Christians.Fergurson, Everett, Backgrounds of Early Christianity, p. 218, (2003), Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, Lucian's account of Alexander represents the Christians—along with the Epicureans—as the special enemies and as the principal objects of his hate: Epicureans had too little religion or superstition to give in to a religious pretender; and the Christian faith was too deep-rooted to dream of any communion with Alexander.Rainy, Robert D. D., The Ancient Catholic Church: From the Accession of Trajan to the Fourth General Council, (A.D. 98-451), p. 32, Charles Scribner's Sons (1902). Lucian's own close investigations into Alexander's methods of fraud led to a serious attempt on his life. The whole account gives a graphic description of the inner working of one among the many new oracles that were springing up at this period. Alexander had remarkable beauty and the striking personality of the successful charlatan, and must have been a man of considerable intellectual abilities and power of organization. His usual methods were those of the numerous oracle-mongers of the time, of which Lucian gives a detailed account: the opening of sealed inquiries by heated needles, a neat plan of forging broken seals, and the giving of vague or meaningless replies to difficult questions, coupled with a lucrative blackmailing of those whose inquiries were compromising. Alexander died of gangrene of the leg in his seventieth year.  Modern scholarship  Scholars have described Alexander as an oracle who perpetrated a hoax to deceive gullible citizens,Hume, David, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: A Critical Edition, p. 175, Oxford University Press (2000), Meyer, Marmin W., The Ancient Mysteries: A Sourcebook, p. 43, University of Pennsylvania Press (1999), or as a false prophet and charlatan who played on the hopes of simple people. He was said to have \\"made predictions, discovered fugitive slaves, detected thieves and robbers, caused treasures to be dug up, healed the sick, and in some cases actually raised the dead\\".Lucian, Alexander the False Prophet, ch. 24 Sociologist Stephen A. Kent, in a study of the text, compares Lucian's Alexander to the \\"malignant narcissist\\" in modern psychiatric theory, and suggests that the \\"behaviors\\" described by Lucian \\"have parallels with several modern cult leaders.\\"Stephen A. Kent. \\"Narcissistic Fraud in the Ancient World: Lucian's Account of Alexander of Abonoteichus and the Cult of Glycon,\\" Ancient Narrative (University of Groningen), Vol. 6.

Though he was in business for a relatively short time — the decade from 1625 to 1635 — Allot had significant connections with the dramatic canons of the two greatest figures of English Renaissance theatre, William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Background Robert Allot became a \\"freeman\\" of the Stationers Company (a full member of the London guild of booksellers) on 9 November 1625. Allot was a younger son of an Edward Allot of Crigleston in Yorkshire, near Wakefield. Robert's brother, another Edward Allot (died 1636, age 33), was a surgeon and Bachelor of Medicine at the University of Cambridge. Nineteenth-century commentators sometimes confused Robert Allot, the publisher who died in 1635, with an earlier Robert Allot, a minor poet and fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge and Linacre Professor of Physic, who edited the verse anthology England's Parnassus (1600). In actuality, the two Robert Allots were uncle and nephew.Joseph Hunter, New Illustrations of the Life, Studies, and Writings of Shakespeare, London, J. B. Nichols and Son, 1845; Vol. 1, p. 130. Shakespeare An entry in the Stationers' Register dated 16 November 1630 transferred the rights to sixteen Shakespearean plays from Edward Blount, one of the publishers of the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays, to Robert Allot; these were sixteen of the eighteen plays in the First Folio that had not been previously published in quarto editions.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 480. Possession of the rights to the sixteen plays made Allot the \\"principal publisher\\"Andrew Murphy, ed., Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare Publishing, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003; p. 52. of the Shakespeare Second Folio when it appeared in 1632. Jonson In 1631, at the same time he was working on the looming Second Folio, Allot was slated to serve as the publisher of a second collection of works by Ben Jonson. Jonson planned the volume as a supplement to the famous 1616 folio of his plays, masques, and poems; the proposed second volume was to include works Jonson had written in the intervening years. Jonson, however, became dissatisfied with the quality of John Beale's printing of the texts; he cancelled the venture. [See: Ben Jonson folios.] Others Allot also published other dramatic texts of his era, including Philip Massinger's The Roman Actor (1629) and The Maid of Honour (1632), and Aurelian Townshend's 1631 Court masque Albion's Triumph. He published volumes of work by Sir Thomas Overbury, George Wither, James Mabbe, and Thomas Randolph. He issued a number of the chivalric romances that were immensely popular in his era. Allot also served as the London retail outlet for books printed at the press of Oxford University.Falconer Madan, The Early Oxford Press, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1895; pp. 302–3. In another direction, Allot bought and sold books with the Cambridge bookseller Troylus Atkinson, who served the town's university community.David John McKitterick, A History of Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; pp. 225, 289–90. And of course Allot published many now-obscure writers and works, from Elizabeth Joscelin's The Mother's Legacy to Her Unborn Child to the Microcosmography of John Earle, Bishop of Salisbury. Post mortem After his death, Allot's widow married stationer Philip Chetwinde, which gave Chetwinde Allot's rights to plays by Shakespeare and Jonson. Chetwinde used Allot's Shakespearean copyrights to publish the Shakespeare Third Folio of 1663/4. Rights to Jonson plays were utilized in the second folio of Jonson's works (1640/1) published by Richard Meighen.

All ports were handled by Genesis with the exception of the ZX Spectrum version which was handled by Big Red Software. The computer versions were published by Codemasters in 1991, with the NES game arriving in 1992 as part of the unlicensed compilation cartridge Quattro Arcade. The player controls a baby elephant by the name of Columbus Jumbo on his way home to Africa. Story After being captured in Africa for the purpose of being put in a zoo, turbulence hits the plane transporting CJ to England causing his cage to open, he grabs a nearby umbrella and leaps out of the airplane while somewhere over France. After landing CJ realises he will have to make his way back home to Africa on foot. Gameplay CJ can jump, has an unlimited amount of peanuts he can fire as projectiles, and a limited number of bombs he can throw. An umbrella opens to slow down his descent when dropping from heights. The game also includes the option for two players to take part simultaneously in a co-operative fashion, though like many platformers of this era there are inherent problems in keeping both players on screen at once; CJ deals with this by only scrolling with player 1, and killing player 2 every time he leaves the screen; this system forces the players to move carefully in synchronization throughout much of the game. =Levels= Elephant Antics has a total of four levels each of which includes an end of level boss fight. The levels throughout the game are all countries that CJ must traverse to reach home, the levels are France, Switzerland, Egypt, and finally Africa. There is also a bike riding bonus stage that takes place between levels in which the player must avoid hazards and collect balloons this mode is however missing from the Spectrum and NES versions. =Items= *Bombs - collecting these increase the amount of bombs you are carrying. *Invincibility Pill - Makes CJ invincible for a short time (absent from the NES version) *Cakes and Bananas - Collecting these give you points. *Fizzy Drink - Gives CJ a temporary speed boost (NES version only). *Map - Appears after each level boss is defeated, collect this to finish the stage. Critical reaction On release the 8-bit computer versions of CJ's Elephant Antics received consistently positive reviews from major publications of the time receiving a 94%at ZZap64 from Zzap!64, a 93% from Raze, 85%at World of Spectrum from Your Sinclair, and 81%at World of Spectrum from Crash.

There were also two games in the series that were cancelled: CJ in Spaceat World of Spectrum and CJ's Island Antics. CJ's Island Antics was outsourced by Codemasters to another team. Though the 3rd game in the series, CJ in Space, was never commercially released the 4th game did see a partial release in Germany for the C64 as a free cover game with one of CP Verlag's digital magazines under the name Jimboat GTW64 Codemasters made several games similar to CJ's Elephant Antics: DJ Puff's Volcanic Adventure and Stuntman Seymour.

Retrieved 2012-04-11 Additional ingredients used can include onion, leeks, garlic, cinnamon and black pepper.  Preparation  The hair is removed from the trotters and they are thoroughly washed. Scallions, garlic, ginger, cheongju (rice wine) and water are brought to a boil. The trotters are added, brought back to a boil and then simmered until tender. After this, additional measures of water, sugar and soy sauce are poured into the pot, and the contents are slowly stirred. Once the trotters are fully cooked, they are de-boned and cut into thick slices. They are then served with a fermented shrimp sauce called saeujeot, cloves of raw peeled garlic, and spicy peppers.  Serving  Spicy version of Jokbal As jokbal is a dish usually shared by several people, it is generally served in large portions, and as it is greasy and has a strong flavour, Korean diners often eat it as ssam, wrapped in a piece of lettuce with sauces and other vegetables. Jokbal is considered an anju, and thus is often accompanied with soju. Restaurants serving jokbal frequently offer both a regular and a spicy version of the dish, with especially spicy versions being dubbed buljokbal—literally \\"fire jokbal\\". Most also offer other variations, including Busan-style naengchae jokbal, which is served cold and garnished with chilled vegetables.  Nutrition  Jokbal contains a lot of gelatin, and is thus said to promote firm, wrinkle-free skin. The amino acid methionine, found in pork, is claimed to counteract the effects of alcohol and to prevent hangovers. Korean sources also attribute numerous other beneficial effects to pork products like jokbal.

The story is set in a Viennese cafe, where a man realizes that he cannot recapture his long lost love. The musical premiered on Broadway in 1915 and enjoyed a successful run. It introduced the song “Auf Wiedersehn”, Romberg's first song hit, originally sung by 18-year-old Vivienne Segal in her professional debut. As in his other early works, Romberg's contributions to this musical are strongly nostalgic, with an emphasis on the waltz as a symbol of the past.

The musical also played at The Muny Repertory in St. Louis in July 1932.Allan Jones website Synopsis Rudolph, a frequent customer at the Blue Paradise Inn in Vienna, is in love with Mizzi, a flower girl. He travels to America to operate one of his father's businesses. During the ensuing 24 years, Mizzi marries one of Rudolph's friends, and the couple has converted the inn into their private residence. After this period, when Rudolph returns to Vienna, and not knowing what has happened, he hopes to find Mizzi at the inn, to rekindle their love just as it had been so long ago, and to return to pre-war days. When he arrives at the inn, he sees that it looks just as he remembered it. He imagines that he has travelled back in time and embraces a woman who looks as Mizzi did in their youth. She turns out to be Mizzi's daughter, Gaby. Mizzi admits that she has arranged matters in this fashion so that Rudolph will accept reality; the past is the past. Gaby is engaged to Rudolph's nephew, Hans, and despite his sense of loss, Rudolph's is pleased for his nephew; the new generation will consummate the lost love of Rudolph's youth.

It refers to the ability of technical support personnel to install, configure, and monitor computer products, identify exceptions or faults, debug or isolate faults to root cause analysis, and provide hardware or software maintenance in pursuit of solving a problem and restoring the product into service. Incorporating serviceability facilitating features typically results in more efficient product maintenance and reduces operational costs and maintains business continuity. Examples of features that facilitate serviceability include: * Help desk notification of exceptional events (e.g., by electronic mail or by sending text to a pager) * Network monitoring * Documentation * Event logging / Tracing (software) * Logging of program state, such as ** Execution path and/or local and global variables ** Procedure entry and exit, optionally with incoming and return variable values (see: subroutine) ** Exception block entry, optionally with local state (see: exception handling) * Software upgrade * Graceful degradation, where the product is designed to allow recovery from exceptional events without intervention by technical support staff * Hardware replacement or upgrade planning, where the product is designed to allow efficient hardware upgrades with minimal computer system downtime (e.g., hotswap components.) Serviceability engineering may also incorporate some routine system maintenance related features (see: Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OA&M.;)) A service tool is defined as a facility or feature, closely tied to a product, that provides capabilities and data so as to service (analyze, monitor, debug, repair, etc.) that product. Service tools can provide broad ranges of capabilities. Regarding diagnosis, a proposed taxonomy of service tools is as follows: * Level 1: Service tool that indicates if a product is functional or not functional. Describing computer servers, the states are often referred to as ‘up’ or ‘down’. This is a binary value. * Level 2: Service tool that provides some detailed diagnostic data. Often the diagnostic data is referred to as a problem ‘signature’, a representation of key values such as system environment, running program name, etc. This level of data is used to compare one problem’s signature to another problem’s signature: the ability to match the new problem to an old one allows one to use the solution already created for the prior problem. The ability to screen problems is valuable when a problem does match a pre-existing problem, but it is not sufficient to debug a new problem. * Level 3: Provides detailed diagnostic data sufficient to debug a new and unique problem. As a rough rule of thumb for these taxonomies, there are multiple ‘orders of magnitude’ of diagnostic data in level 1 vs. level 2 vs. level 3 service tools. Additional characteristics and capabilities that have been observed in service tools: * Time of data collection: some tools can collect data immediately, as soon as problem occurs, others are delayed in collecting data. * Pre-analyzed, or not- yet-analyzed data: some tools collect ‘external’ data, while others collect ‘internal’ data. This is seen when comparing system messages (natural language-like statements in the user’s native language) vs. ‘binary’ storage dumps. * Partial or full set of system state data: some tools collect a complete system state vs. a partial system state (user or partial ‘binary’ storage dump vs. complete system dump). * Raw or analyzed data: some tools display raw data, while others analyze it (examples storage dump formatters that format data, vs. ‘intelligent’ data formatters (“ANALYZE” is a common verb) that combine product knowledge with analysis of state variables to indicate the ‘meaning’ of the data. * Programmable tools vs. ‘fixed function’ tools. Some tools can be altered to get varying amounts of data, at varying times. Some tools have only a fixed function. * Automatic or manual? Some tools are built into a product, to automatically collect data when a fault or failure occurs. Other tools have to be specifically invoked to start the data collection process. * Repair or non-repair? Some tools collect data as a fore- runner to an automatic repair process (self-healing/fault tolerant). These tools have the challenge of quickly obtaining unaltered data before the desired repair process starts.

Adopted in the 1790s by George Washington, the first president of the United States, as his official manner of address as head of state, \\"Mr. President\\" has subsequently been used by other governments to refer to their heads of state. It is the conventional translation of non-English titles such as Monsieur le Président for the president of the French Republic. It also has a long history of usage as the title of the presiding officers of legislative and judicial bodies. The speaker of the House of Commons of Canada is addressed as Monsieur le Président in French, and Mr. Speaker in English. History =In the United States= The 1787 Constitution of the United States did not specify the manner of address for the president. When George Washington was sworn in as the first president of the United States on April 30, 1789, the administering of the oath of office ended with the proclamation: \\"Long live George Washington, President of the United States.\\" No title other than the name of the office of the executive was officially used at the inauguration. The question of a presidential title was being debated in Congress at the time, however, having become official legislative business with Richard Henry Lee's motion of April 23, 1789. Lee's motion asked congress to consider \\"what titles it will be proper to annex to the offices of President and Vice President of the United States—if any other than those given in the Constitution.\\" Vice President John Adams, in his role as President of the United States Senate, organized a congressional committee. There Adams agitated for the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties) for the President. Adams and Lee were among the most outspoken proponents of an exalted presidential title. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency, the latter of which was vociferously opposed by Adams, who contended that it was far beneath the presidential dignity, as the executives of the states, some of which were also titled \\"President\\" (e.g. the President of Pennsylvania), at that time often enjoyed the style of Excellency; Adams said that the president \\"would be leveled with colonial governors or with functionaries from German princedoms\\" if he were to use the style of Excellency. Adams and Richard Henry Lee both feared that cabals of powerful senators would unduly influence a weak executive, and saw an exalted title as a way of strengthening the presidency. On further consideration, Adams deemed even Highness insufficient and instead proposed that the executive, both the president and the vice president (i.e., himself), be styled Majesty to prevent the \\"great danger\\" of an executive with insufficient dignity. Adams' efforts were met with widespread derision and perplexion; Thomas Jefferson called them \\"the most superlatively ridiculous thing I ever heard of\\", while Benjamin Franklin considered it \\"absolutely mad\\". Washington consented to the demands of James Madison and the United States House of Representatives that the title be altered to \\"Mr. President.\\" Nonetheless, later \\"The Honorable\\" later became the standard title of the President in formal address, and \\"His/Her Excellency\\" became the title of the President when addressed formally internationally. Historically, the title was reserved for the incumbent president only, and was not be used for former presidents, holding that it was not proper to use the title as a courtesy title when addressing a former president. Despite that, some sources maintain that living former U.S. presidents continue to be addressed as \\"Mr. President\\", both formally and informally, and some contemporary experts on etiquette now maintain that it is entirely appropriate. In the United States, the title \\"Mr. President\\" is used in a number of formal instances as well: for example anyone presiding over the United States Senate is addressed as \\"Mr. President.\\" Other uses of the title include presidents of state and local legislatures, however only the president of the United States uses the title outside of formal sessions. =In other countries= Thomas Hungerford, who became the first speaker of the English House of Commons in 1376, used the title, \\"Mr. Speaker,\\" a precedent followed by subsequent speakers of the House of Commons. This influenced parliamentary usage in France. By the 18th century, the president of a French parlement was addressed as \\"Monsieur le Président.\\" In Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's 1782 novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses (\\"Dangerous Liaisons\\"), the wife of a magistrate in a parlement is referred to as Madame la Présidente de Tourvel (\\"Madam President of Tourvel\\"). When the Second French Republic was established in 1848, \\"Monsieur le Président\\" became the title of the president of the French Republic. The speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, established in 1867, is also addressed as \\"Monsieur le Président\\" or \\"Madame la Présidente\\" in French. Spousal or female titles Titles for a president's spouse, if female, have ranged from \\"Marquise,\\" \\"Lady\\" to simply \\"Mrs.\\" or \\"Ms.\\" If male the title of the president's spouse may be \\"Marquis\\", \\"Lord\\", or merely \\"Mr.\\". =United States= President George Washington's wife, Martha Washington, was often called \\"Lady Washington.\\" By the 1850s in the United States, the term \\"lady\\" had changed from a title of nobility to a term of address for a respected and well-mannered woman. The use of \\"First Lady\\" to refer to the wife of the president of the United States was popularized about the time of the US Civil War. Dolley Madison, the wife of President James Madison, was remembered after her death in 1849 by President Zachary Taylor as \\"truly our First Lady for a half a century.\\" First ladies are usually referred to simply as \\"Mrs. [last name]\\" The United States has never elected a woman as president. If the United States elects a currently married woman as president, her husband will presumably be addressed as either First Man or First Gentleman while the president herself will presumably be addressed as Madam President.If a male president's wife is the first lady, what would a female president's husband be known as? First man? First gentleman, First what?, The Guardian. Retrieved on April 12th, 2016.  In the media  On 8 November 2016, the night of the 2016 presidential election in the United States, images of leaked pre-printed copies of Newsweek magazine showed the magazine celebrating the win of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, with the cover titled \\"Madam President\\". It is common for Newsweek to prepare for the eventuality of either candidate winning, though it was unusual that it was both published and distributed; the cover was pulled from newsstands after it became clear that Donald Trump had secured a majority of electoral votes, winning the election.

Should these limit states be exceeded, a structure that may still be structurally sound would nevertheless be considered unfit. It refers to conditions other than the building strength that render the buildings unusable. Serviceability limit state design of structures includes factors such as durability, overall stability, fire resistance, deflection, cracking and excessive vibration. For example, a skyscraper could sway severely and cause the occupants to be sick (much like sea-sickness), yet be perfectly sound structurally. This building is in no danger of collapsing, yet since it is obviously no longer fit for human occupation, it is considered to have exceeded its serviceability limit state. Serviceability limit A serviceability limit defines the performance criterion for serviceability and corresponds to a conditions beyond which specified service requirements resulting from the planned use are no longer met. In limit state design, a structure fails its serviceability if the criteria of the serviceability limit state are not met during the specified service life and with the required reliability. Hence, the serviceability limit state identifies a civil engineering structure which fails to meet technical requirements for use even though it may be strong enough to remain standing. A structure that fails serviceability has exceeded a defined limit for one of the following properties: * Excessive deflection * Vibration * Local deformation (engineering) Serviceability limits are not always defined by building code developer, government or regulatory agency. Building codes tend to be restricted to ultimate limits related to public and occupant safety. Global geopolitical variations are likely to exist.

It derives from a Middle English nickname which meant someone with strong arms. In Ireland the name was adopted as an Anglicization of two Gaelic names from Ulster: Mac Thréinfhir (meaning \\"son of the strong man\\") and Ó Labhraidh Tréan (meaning \\"strong O'Lavery\\"). Clan Armstrong is a clan from the border area between England and Scotland. The Scottish Armstrong is reputed to have been originally bestowed by \\"an antient (sic) king of Scotland\\" upon \\"Fairbairn, his armour-bearer\\" following an act of strength in battle. In the UK this surname is well represented in North East England, Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire, Scottish Borders, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, Dumfries & Galloway, and Northern Ireland, and in the US it is well represented in the Deep South, and other southern states. From the name Ó Labhraidh Tréan (meaning \\"strong O'Lavery\\" and sometimes written in Anglo-Irish as \\"Tréanlámagh\\") the following surnames survive: \\"Trainor\\", Traynor\\", O'Lavery\\", \\"McLavery\\", and \\"MacLavery\\". Although the name \\"Armstrong\\" is quite common in the Aghagallon and Glenavy area of County Antrim in Northern Ireland, the other names are to be found within the nine Ulster Counties and Scotland, especially along the west coast.

Directed by the film's cinematographer Andrew Lau, the film features a large ensemble cast, which includes Ekin Cheng, Jordan Chan, Francis Ng, Gigi Lai and Simon Yam. Based on a popular comic book series named \\"Guwak tsai\\" or \\"Teddy Boy\\" in English. This film contributed a lot to the public image of triads and was condemned by certain quarters as glorifying secret triad societies. However, it was immensely popular in Hong Kong and spun a long list of sequels and spin-offs. Its main actors and actresses have also become major stars in their own right. Plot Beginning in 1985, teenagers Chan Ho Nam (Ekin Cheng), his best friends \\"Chicken\\" Chiu (Jordan Chan), Tai Tin Yee (Michael Tse), Pou Pan (Jerry Lam) and older brother Chow Pan (Jason Chu) idolise the local \\"Hung Hing\\" Society and one of its leaders, \\"Uncle Bee\\" (Ng Chi Hung). When Ho Nam and his friends are beaten by Hung Hing's \\"Ugly Kwan\\" (Francis Ng) and his men following a misunderstanding, they decide to join the society, following Bee. Ten years later, in 1995, Ho Nam and his buddies have established themselves as Bee's enforcers, performing their first successful hit on Kwan's associate \\"Ba Bai\\" (Joe Chen). At the same time, Brother Fai Hung has the stuttering Smartie (Gigi Lai a.k.a. Tania Sammy) carjack Ho Nam's Toyota MR2 and demand payment, but unfortunately she gets caught by Ho Nam and his friends and is punished by eating dozens of Chinese barbecue pork buns. Seeing Ho Nam is making a name for himself in the society, Kwan attempts to buy him out and have Ho Nam work for him instead of Bee, but the gangster refuses. When he finds Smartie about to be forced into an adult film produced by Kwan's studio, Ho Nam takes her aside, claiming she is his woman. The indebted Smartie follows him, even beginning to fall for him. One day, Bee is tasked with an assignment by Hung Hing chairman Chiang Tin Sung (Simon Yam) to head to Macau and perform another hit. Bee orders Ho Nam and his men to execute the plan. Sadly, this was all a ploy on Kwan's doing: by using Chicken's fidelity to separate him from Ho Nam and falsifying information to chairman Chiang, Ho Nam and his remaining friends are ambushed by other triad members under Kwan. Chow Pan is brutally killed and Ho Nam is blamed for the failed hit. Friendships begin to tear apart when Chicken's girlfriend and Ho Nam are kidnapped and drugged by Kwan's men into sex, videotaping their actions as proof of violating orders. With nearly all of Hung Hing looking for them for explanations, Chicken heads to Taiwan in exile. At a Hung Hing summit, Kwan accuses Bee of failing the hit and Ho Nam for breaking the \\"code\\" of sleeping with his best friend's woman, with the videotape as evidence. Kwan also takes the opportunity of blaming chairman Chiang for not inducing better protocols within the society and nominates himself as the new chairman. Other branch leaders are in agreement, thus Chiang steps down and Kwan takes the head position, with only Bee opposing him. To settle things, Ho Nam is punished and banned from rejoining Hung Hing. Ten months later, Kwan orders Bee killed alongside his entire family. With most of Hung Hing siding with Kwan, and no evidence to support Kwan killing Bee, Ho Nam can do next to nothing, until Chicken returns from Taiwan, now a branch leader in a local triad and re-establishes relations with his friends. Deciding to get rid of Kwan and bring back the morally inclined Chiang, Ho Nam and Chicken bribe other branch leaders into assassinating Kwan. Working indirectly with local law enforcement, who have discovered Kwan has been smuggling cocaine using his film studio, Ho Nam and his allies manage to corner Kwan, who admits to everything, until he tries to escape using Pou Pan as a hostage. He is eventually shot and killed by a police officer for wielding a firearm and pointing at him. Chiang returns and retakes the position of Hung Hing chairman, congratulating Ho Nam for his efforts, ensuring his name will be well known throughout the society. This movie glorifies the value in being virtuous even in a life of crime. In a world in which loyalties do not exist, these group of young gangsters stood by their friends and followed the code of friendship even to the end.

It was originally written in 1959, but because the Oz books were not selling, it was not published. The first two editions of the book were published in 8½ x 11 inch format and running only 94 pages. This was done at the request of illustrator Dick Martin to reduce the number of required illustrations and to show them closer to the actual size they were drawn. The second printing (1986) featured a new cover, with the first edition artwork reprinted preceding the title page. The third printing (2007) is standard Oz book size. Its cover is a gaudier redesign of the second edition cover. The book also features maps by James E. Haff, and as such, Thompson correctly places the Winkie Country in the west of Oz. Plot summary The story begins with Thomas P. \\"Tompy\\" Terry, an athlete and musician son of a physicist, star drummer in his marching band at Pennwood prep in fictional small town, Pennwood, Pennsylvania, swept away by then-fictitious Hurricane Hannah on his way to the Labor Day parade. He lands on the shore of Winkie Lake, where he meets Yankee, the first American dog in space, a bull terrier delighted at his newfound ability to talk. The nearest town is Wackajammy, in the northeastern part of the Winkie Country, which is the breadbasket of the West. The King, Jackalack, believes that Tompy and Yankee are there to fulfill a prophecy to rescue their princess, his aunt, Doffi, who instructs all of the bakers of the town, who refuse to do any work without her present. Yammer Jammer, the king's advizer, using a book called the Mind Reader determines that the two have no intent to do the search when they leave, and locks them in prison. Yankee is able to dig out during the night and get the key, and when they leave, they steal the Mind Reader. Though determined to get home, Yankee in particular wishes to rescue the princess anyway. They next encounter an anteater, a town of powdered and packaged workaholic people, Tidy Town, whose king wants to force them to be listeners, cross into the Gillikin Country with the aid of Tim Ber the Trav-E-Log, meet a kindly but private woodsman named Axel, and a village of pleasant people with luminescent paper lanterns for heads who are active only at night. Climbing Mount Upandup, they meet a flower fairy named Su-Posy who mentions that she delivers flowers to an imprisoned princess nearby to cheer her up. Also resting on this mountain is Jinnicky the Red Jinn, with whom Tompy and Yankee make fast friends. Also living on the mountain is Badmannah, who has kidnapped Princess doffi, and soon after, uses a magic magnifying glass to abduct Princess Ozma and the entire Emerald City palace. Regrouping at the Red Jinn's palace, Yankee procures a net and attaches it to Jinnicky's jinrikisha as a drag net, using it to capture Badmannah and lower him to the bottom of the Nonestic Ocean. He cannot drown here, being immortal like all Ozites, but it will get him out of the way for a while. That leaves the task of restoring the Emerald City palace. Except for Ozma, the residents are all crammed into a magic box that Jinnicky has not allowed to be opened until the palace is restored, except when Yankee is briefly trapped as well. Once opened, Ozma is still missing. Using the Magic Picture, she is seen in Badmannah's cave, Ozma having wished herself via the Magic Belt to the nearest safe place, and with Badmannah gone, it was. Using his red magic, Jinnicky restores the Emerald City. Jinnicky flies Tompy home in his jinrikisha, and gives him a little jar to open when in need of his magic. Yankee is recognizable from newspapers, and Mr. Terry returns him to the Army, requesting that he be given an honorable discharge to be Tompy's pet. The Army representative initially declines, but when Tompy opens the jar, relents. Yankee retains the ability to speak once a week, and together, they decide to read The Purple Prince of Oz a chapter a night to learn about the adventures of their friend, Jinnicky. Tompy is not the first traveler to Oz to be familiar with it from reading the books, which are explicitly referenced as being available in the United States as fairy tales—Peter Brown in The Gnome King of Oz briefly mentions having read an Oz book (Betsy Bobbin and Trot are aware of Oz before they get there, but we are not told how). It is, however, the first to mention another Oz book within the text, although John R. Neill had drawn an image of a shelf in Oz full of the Oz books, one being read. The book has no subplot, and moves straightforwardly through its single plot, uncharacteristic of previous Oz books, but typical of the deuterocanonical books of which it is the first. 1972 American novels American fantasy novels Oz (franchise) books 1972 fantasy novels 1972 children's books ","title":"Yankee in Oz"},{"id":"13192090","text":"Sweeping the Spotlight Away is a 1974 album by Canadian singer-songwriter Murray McLauchlan.

Propelled by the electronic music compositions and keyboards of John Mills- Cockell, the group broke musical ground with their innovative use of the Moog Synthesizer and their world music inspirations. Their song, \\"Tillicum\\", received national attention as the theme music for the television series Here Come the Seventies. Career Syrinx formed in 1970, when composer and multi- instrumentalist Mills-Cockell joined forces with percussionist Alan Wells and saxophonist Doug Pringle. A progressive music trio whose body of work incorporated elements of electronica, classical and world music, and psychedelic rock, Syrinx initially played the Toronto coffee-house circuit. After a time, Canadian music executive and talent manager Bernie Finkelstein signed the trio to his newly-created True North Records.http://johnmillscockell.ca/?p=1381 =Debut Album= Syrinx released its first (eponymous) album in 1970. In its wake, the group found itself newly in demand from a variety of quarters: Syrinx opened for jazz legend Miles Davis on his Bitches Brew tour, and played bills with Ravi Shankar.http://johnmillscockell.ca/?p=1381 In addition, the first release attracted the attention of executives from CTV, which commissioned a theme song for its forward-looking television series Here Come the Seventies. This commission resulted in Mills-Cockell composing Tillicum, which was later released as a single and was included on Syrinx’s second album.http://johnmillscockell.ca/?p=1381 The first album also resulted in a 1971 commission, from the respected Toronto Repertory Orchestra under the direction of Milton Barnes, of Stringspace, which Mills-Cockell composed for Syrinx, the TRO, and additional percussion. Stringspace is a 26-minute composition in four movements: Syren, December Angel, Ibisitx, and Field Hymn (Epilogue). Stringspace was performed live and broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s program Music to See in 1971.http://johnmillscockell.ca/?p=1381https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LKDcvkZJkQ =Long Lost Relatives= Riding the wave of notice and critical approval that arose from their first album, Syrinx returned to the studio in late 1970 to record a second album. However, after weeks of recording, a fire destroyed the studio, the group’s instruments - including Mills-Cockell’s Moog Mark II - and the master tapes of the recordings for their new album.http://moogfoundation.org/early-live-moog-modular-artists-john-mills- cockell/ Undeterred, and with fundraising support from the Toronto musical community, the group purchased new instruments and pressed on to record the album. Long Lost Relatives was issued in 1971 on Finkelstein’s True North label. The album included Mills-Cockell’s Tillicum and the four Stringspace pieces (which, owing to the space restrictions of the LP medium, spanned both sides of the LP), rounded out by three additional Mills-Cockell compositions: Tumblers to the Vault, Better Deaf and Dumb from the First, and Aurora Spinray. Tillicum was also released as a single, and peaked at #38 on the Canadian charts in 1971.http://johnmillscockell.ca/?p=1381 Dissolution and reissues The group disbanded in 1972 as Mills-Cockell and the other members went on to pursue other projects.http://johnmillscockell.ca/?p=1381 Mills- Cockell remains active in composition for stage, television, film, and radio. Pringle is a producer and director of digital media, television and music. Wells died in 2010 of lung cancer. On 24 August 2016, RVNG Intl. announced the release of Tumblers from the Vault, a remastered collection including the entire released repertoire of Syrinx, together with previously-unreleased tracks, including the audio recording of the CBC Music to See performance of Stringspace. Tumblers from the Vault was offered for pre-order on 24 August 2016, and was released on 14 October 2016.http://igetrvng.com/shop/rervng08/ Critical Reception Reviews from Syrinx's active years in the early '70s are difficult to come by.

Originally titled in Japan and based on the anime/manga Kujaku Ou, it is the sequel to SpellCaster for the Sega Master System. Story Mystic Defender takes place in an alternate Japan fantasy setting in which the anarchistic sorcerer Zareth kidnaps a young woman named Alexandra. Zareth plans to use Alexandra as a sacrifice for the resurrecting of an ancient and evil god known as Zao. Not long after the kidnapping, Zareth's plan becomes apparent as Azuchi castle - the dwelling of Zao - rises from the waters. Joe Yamato, an experienced sorcerer, is called into action to save Alexandra and stop Zareth's plan to resurrect Zao by battling his way through the dark and bizarre disciples and demons of Zao. Magic The players only means of defense in the game is the use of magical spells that the player can acquire during game play (by picking the power up). Players start with a single shooting ball of energy that can be charged to fire one powerful shot, but players can also acquire a spiritual flame that can be pointed in straight and diagonal directions and when charged can reach good distances and a spherical power that launches ricocheting spheres around the screen that multiply when fully charged. Aside from these powers, players can also use a screen-clearing power that summons a three-headed dragon that destroys all enemies and fired shots on screen.

History On August 2, 1982, this station signed on the air as KWCS.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1983 page B-233 It originally broadcast on FM frequency 96.7 MHz with a Country format that was automated part of the day. KWCS was nicknamed \\"Wise County Stereo.\\" The station was owned by the Bridgeport Broadcasting Company and was originally powered at only 3,000 watts, limiting its signal to the suburbs northwest of Fort Worth. In 1993, the station swapped signals with KDVS (now KTCK-FM), moving to 98.3 MHz, and changing its call sign to KBOC. The station kept its country music format. For a time, it was a sister station to KNOR 93.7 FM. Owner Dick Witkovski announced the sale of KBOC to Entravision Communications in early 2005. But that deal fell through. KBOC then began simulcasting country music from 92.1 KTFW-FM until November 11, 2005, when the station went dark, pending its renewed sale to Entravision. KBOC returned to the air with a Tejano music format on February 6, 2006. It was called \\"José 98.3.\\" In August 2006, Liberman Broadcasting announced it would purchase the station. Full acquisition took place in November. Liberman changed the branding to \\"El Norte 98.3.\\" In 2011, Liberman rebranded KBOC as \\"La Z 98.3,\\" airing a Regional Mexican format. That lasted about five years.

Signal Unlike most of the area's FM stations, which transmit their signals from Cedar Hill, KBOC transmits its signal from an unincorporated area within the county borders of Cooke, Montague, and Wise. Therefore, KBOC's signal is much stronger in the Northwestern parts of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex as well as the cities of Decatur, Bowie, Gainesville, and Sherman, to as far north as Ardmore, Oklahoma, but is considerably weaker in Dallas and areas Southeast of the city itself.

Eckert confessed to only six murders, five of whom were sex workers, but is known to have killed at least nine women, and is also accused of committing additional murders of women in several European countries including Italy and the Czech Republic, but investigations were closed after Eckert committed suicide during his criminal proceedings on July 2, 2007.  Murders  Eckert committed his first murder in 1974, aged fifteen, in his hometown of Plauen, East Germany, when he strangled a 14-year-old girl to death. The girl had been a schoolmate, and Eckert succeeded in making the murder appear as a suicide. In 1987, Eckert was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for attempted murder for two nearly-fatal attacks against women. In 1994, Eckert was released from custody and lived in Hof, where he began work as a truck driver, a job which required travelling to several European countries. According to police in France and Spain, Eckert is believed to have killed at least five women working as sex workers in these countries between 2001 and 2006: * June 25, 2001, a Kenyan sex worker near Chermignac, near the city of Bordeaux in western France. * October 9, 2001, a 24-year-old sex worker in Maçanet de la Selva, Catalonia, Spain. * March 1, 2005, a Russian sex worker in Sant Sadurní d'Osormort, Catalonia, Spain. * October 2, 2006, a 28-year-old Polish sex worker at Reims, France. * November 2, 2006, a 20-year-old Bulgarian sex worker in Hostalric, in Catalonia, Spain. In most cases, Eckert strangled the women, performed amateur post mortems on them, and finally photographed them. In addition, he cut off the hair or dressed the dead bodies, and kept them in the cab of his truck or in his apartment. = Unconfirmed murders = Eckert is believed to have at least seven additional murders across Europe, including: * April 1987, an 18-year-old in Plauen, East Germany. * August 2002: a 23-year-old sex worker from Sierra Leone in Troyes, France. * 5 September 2004: a 25-year-old Ghanaian sex worker in Rezzato, Italy. * Four other women, three of them in the Czech Republic and one in France, according to the police in those countries. = Arrest = Following the murder on 2 November 2006, footage caught by a surveillance camera showing Eckert's truck next to the naked corpse of his victim, which was located beside the parking lot, was reported to the Spanish police. Eckert could be identified via the truck, and a few weeks later German police detained him in Wesseling, near Cologne, on 17 November 2006. The police found tufts of hair and pictures of his victims subjected to various tortures in Eckert's truck and in his house. During the interrogations, Eckert acknowledged committing six murders, the five sex workers in France and Spain, and that of his classmate in Germany.  Death  Eckert committed suicide on 2 July 2007, in the middle of criminal proceedings against him, and was found dead in his cell in Bayreuth, Bavaria. After his death, the police found evidence that Eckert had killed nine women across Germany, France, Spain and Italy. Furthermore, there are strong indications that he killed another four women. In December 2007, five months after Eckert's death, the German police ceased investigations and closed the file.

The sessions were originally recorded in June 1991, but did not receive an official release until 1998. History By 1991, Glenn Hughes’ solo career had yet to take off, he had spent much of the eighties in short lived musical collaborations with the likes of Pat Thrall, Black Sabbath and Gary Moore he had failed to establish himself long-term. This was, in part due to drug issues that had first surfaced in the seventies, while he was in Deep Purple and continued throughout the following decade. Hughes had first met keyboardist Geoff Downes when they were introduced to one another by Downes's then- Asia band-mate Pat Thrall (who had worked with Hughes in Hughes/Thrall). Downes had joined Hughes to record keyboard parts for an intended solo album financed by Bronze Records, but that record was subsequently shelved and remains unreleased. Downes also joined Hughes to play keyboards on a brief 1991 Trapeze reunion tour. In June 1991, Hughes teamed up Downes again and the two spent a week in Nomis Studios, London. They were there at the suggestion of their publishing company to write material for a new Hughes solo album. For the sessions the pair decided to write material in a more mainstream pop and soul direction, rather than the hard and progressive rock they were associated with. The pair wrote songs at a fast pace during their one week in the studio, writing more than a song a day. Due to a number of reasons the project did not go beyond that week and the material was shelved. The demos were leaked and became commonly available as bootlegs. In 1998, Blueprint Records decided to give the rehearsal tapes an official release in the form of The Work Tapes. The tracks were not added to and the sound-quality of the release is not comparable to that of a studio album. It is a document of interest to fans of Hughes and Downes, rather than a complete work. The content of The Work Tapes was released again in 2005 in a two-CD set entitled Roads of Destiny. This release was labelled as an album by Geoff Downes and Glenn Hughes, but it features only one other song with Hughes; a cover version of the Buggles song Video Killed the Radio Star, which was originally released on Downes's 1992 solo album Vox Humana. The rest of Roads to Destiny is instrumental music that does not feature Hughes.

It is a practice that has been recommended by Catholic leaders and saints as a powerful means of growing in love with God, in humility, and having sorrow for sins, since it is considered a personal encounter with Jesus who is the source of God's grace, help, and forgiveness.http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/confessional-not-a-dry- cleaner-says-pope/ A recommended frequency, based on the teachings of the Pope and Catholic Church law, is between once a month and once a week.http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=9057 This practice \\"was introduced into the Church by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\", according to Pius XII. Confession of everyday faults is \\"strongly recommended by the Church\\", according to the Catechism of the Catholic Church 1458. Paul VI said that frequent Confession is \\"of great value\\". According to the study of Sal Ferigle of Church law and teachings, \\"whenever possible, frequent Confession will ordinarily mean between once a month and once a week.\\"http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=9057 Many Lutheran Churches also encourage going to frequent Holy Absolution, and follow similar teachings as Roman Catholics on frequent Confession. Basis and importance The Catholic Church teaches that everyone is called to sanctity, since man was created to love and serve God, the ultimate source of man's happiness. For this, God has given the sacraments as God's way of giving divine life to each person. The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches: :Without being strictly necessary, confession of everyday faults (venial sins) is nevertheless strongly recommended by the Church. Indeed the regular Confession of our venial sins helps us form our conscience, fight against evil tendencies, let ourselves be healed by Christ and progress in the life of the Spirit. By receiving more frequently through this sacrament the gift of the Father's mercy, we are spurred to be merciful as he is merciful. (CCC 1458) Paul VI: \\"Frequent recourse to Confession is of great value.\\" Paul VI who presided over the Second Vatican Council taught that frequent Confession is \\"of great value\\". :“Frequent and reverent recourse to this sacrament, even when only venial sin is in question, is of great value. Frequent Confession is not mere ritual repetition, nor is it merely a psychological exercise. Rather it is a constant effort to bring to perfection the grace of our Baptism, so that we carry about in our bodies the death of Jesus Christ who died; so that the life Jesus Christ lives may be more and more manifested in us. In such Confessions, while indeed confessing venial sins, penitents should be mainly concerned with becoming more conformed to Christ and more submissive to the voice of the Spirit.” John Paul II who went to Confession weekly, said: :\\"It would be an illusion to seek after holiness, according to the vocation one has received from God, without partaking frequently of this sacrament of conversion and reconciliation. Those who go to Confession frequently, and do so with the desire to make progress, will notice the strides that they make in their spiritual lives.\\" In his Apostolic Exhortation, Reconcilatio et Paenitentia, John Paul II also encouraged frequent Confession even if only of venial sins: :\\"We shall also do well to recall that, for a balanced spiritual and pastoral orientation in this regard, great importance must continue to be given to teaching the faithful also to make use of the sacrament of penance for venial sins alone, as is borne out by a centuries-old doctrinal tradition and practice. :\\"Though the church knows and teaches that venial sins are forgiven in other ways too - for instance, by acts of sorrow, works of charity, prayer, penitential rites - she does not cease to remind everyone of the special usefulness of the sacramental moment for these sins too. The frequent use of the sacrament - to which some categories of the faithful are in fact held - strengthens the awareness that even minor sins offend God and harm the church, the body of Christ. Its celebration then becomes for the faithful 'the occasion and the incentive to conform themselves more closely to Christ and to make themselves more docile to the voice of the Spirit.' Above all it should be emphasized that the grace proper to the sacramental celebration has a great remedial power and helps to remove the very roots of sin.\\"(32; citing Ordo Paenitentiae, 17) Advantages of frequent Confession The advantages of frequent Confession was discussed by Pius XII. He said that \\"the pious practice of frequent Confession which was introduced into the Church by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit [is] to be earnestly advocated.\\" Pius XII, who went to Confession daily,https://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=1942 explained that by frequent Confession: *genuine self-knowledge is increased, *Christian humility grows, *bad habits are corrected, *spiritual neglect and tepidity are resisted, *the conscience is purified, *the will strengthened, *a salutary self-control is attained, *grace is increased in virtue of the sacrament itself. He then warned those \\"who make light of or lessen esteem for frequent Confession know what they are doing. What they are doing is alien to the spirit of Christ and disastrous for the Mystical Body of Christ.\\" Benedict Baur's book, Frequent Confession is a classic in explaining the advantages of frequent Confession: :In frequent Confession we have everything that will guard us against tepidity. For one thing, frequent Confession compels us to look into ourselves seriously to see our sins and faults, to elicit an act of contrition for them and formulate a purpose of amendment regarding them. In other words, it makes us apply ourselves with full deliberation and determination to improving our lives. :Then, too, Confession is a sacrament and consequently, through it the power of Christ himself works in us. His greatest desire in this sacrament is to fill us with his own hatred of sin and with his own zeal to glorify his Father in all things, to be completely devoted to his service and fully resigned to his holy will. :Finally, of considerable value is the direction we get from our confessor, who in every Confession will urge us anew and encourage us to continue along the way of virtue with full fervor. :It is this conviction that makes the Church recommend so strongly, indeed prescribe as an obligation, frequent or weekly Confession for clerics and religious. Therefore let us consider frequent Confession as something important and holy. And let us endeavor always to make our Confessions well indeed to try and make them better and better every time. John Paul II also enumerated these: *we are renewed in fervor, *strengthened in our resolutions, and *supported by divine encouragement He said those who discourage frequent Confession \\"are lying.\\" Recommended frequency According to Rev. Fr. Sal Ferigle, \\"For those who sincerely wish to do their best to avail themselves of the opportunity of frequent Confession in order to grow spiritually, frequent Confession will ordinarily be linked to having a fixed confessor. The confessor will be the best qualified person to suggest the frequency suited to the spiritual development and the physical and moral possibilities of the penitent. Within those rather broad limits of flexibility and to seek a general rule of common sense, we can refer to [Paul VI's General Audiences] which speaks about 'receiving the Sacrament of Penance frequently, that is twice a month.' Previous legislation which specified regular intervals for Confession spoke about weekly Confession. One can therefore say in general terms that, whenever possible, frequent Confession will ordinarily mean between once a month and once a week.\\"http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=9057 See also *Morning Offering *Thanksgiving after Communion *Rosary *Spiritual reading *Angelus *Memorare *Visit to the Blessed Sacrament *Examination of conscience References Further reading *Frequent Confession by Rev.

Early Life & Monkhood  Master Fayun was born in 1933 in Jiangxi province, China. His lay name was Yu Heng-sheng. He entered the Buddhist monastic order at thirteen years of age and received the religious name Fayun meaning Dharma Cloud (Cloud of the Buddha’s Teachings). He was a disciple of the eminent Chinese monk Hsu Yun (虛雲; Pinyin: Xuyun) (1840–1959) and was also one of his personal attendants who served him, most notably during the Yunmen incident in 1951-52 when Master Hsu Yun and his monks were beaten and tortured by thugs that surrounded Yunmen Monastery (雲門寺; Yunmen Si) in Shaoguan, Guangdong province, soon after the Communist Revolution in China.Xu Yun (Author); Luk, Charles (Translator); Hunn, Richard (Revised & edited): \\"Empty Cloud: The Autobiography of the Chinese Zen Master Xu Yun\\", pages 138-140.

Dharma Realm Buddhist University, 1983,  Coming to the West  In 1969, Master Fayun came to the United States at the invitation of a Buddhist devotee to teach Chan Buddhism (i.e. Zen Buddhism) and Pure Land Buddhism in America. In 1974, he founded the Grace Gratitude Buddhist Temple (美國紐約佛恩寺; Meiguo Niuyue Fo'en Si) in New York City. Today, it is one of the oldest Chinese Buddhist temples in the city. Starting in 1985, he served as a liaison coordinator for the World Buddhist Sangha Council (世界佛教僧伽會; Shijie Fojiao Sengqie Hui). From 1979 to 2002, he served as vice president of the American Buddhist Confederation (美國佛教聯合會; Meiguo Fojiao Lianhe Hui). Master Fayun was known by all for his utmost compassion towards all people and living beings.  Passing  Master Fayun died on September 25, 2003. Soon after his cremation, many relics (Sanskrit: Sarira; Chinese: Sheli 舍利; Tibetan: Ringsel), round pellet-size material that look like beads, crystals, or pearls of any color that are found in the cremated ashes of those who are believed to possess advanced spiritual qualities, were discovered amongst his cremains. The cremains were brought back to Yunmen Monastery in Guangdong province, China in November 2003 and they, along with some of his relics, were finally interred into a memorial stupa there in 2004.

Median daily flows total about 350,000 In computer networking, an elephant flow is an extremely large (in total bytes) continuous flow set up by a TCP (or other protocol) flow measured over a network link. Elephant flows, though not numerous, can occupy a disproportionate share of the total bandwidth over a period of time. It is not clear who coined \\"elephant flow\\", but the term began occurring in published Internet network research in 2001 when the observations were made that a small number of flows carry the majority of Internet traffic and the remainder consists of a large number of flows that carry very little Internet traffic (mice flows). For example, researchers Mori et al. studied the traffic flows on several Japanese universities and research networks. At the WIDE network they found elephant flows were only 4.7% of all flows but occupied 41.3% of all data transmitted during the time period. The actual impact of elephant flows on Internet traffic is still an area of research and debate. Some research shows that elephant flows may be highly correlated with traffic spikes and other elephant flows (Lan & Heidemann and Mori et al.). Elephant flows have varying definitions proposed by researchers including flows that occupy greater than 1% of total traffic in a time period, measuring the duration of the flow, and looking at flows whose size is greater than the mean plus three standard deviations of traffic during the time period. One of the main goals of research into elephant flows is to develop more efficient bandwidth management tools and predictive models for the Internet. For example, researchers have focused on providing better quality of service to flows of small sizes (mice flows) by de-prioritizing elephant flows.

It has been the hub of the city's life and a prestigious address for more than 600 years. During the 20th century, the square saw periodic mass gatherings celebrating first national independence, then the defeat of the uprising after which it is now named, and finally the memory of the event. Dotted by cafés, restaurants, and small stores, it is a popular place for the locals to linger, and a tourist attraction notable for its historical buildings, and visual appeal. The whole square is a free public WiFi hotspot.

After Banská Bystrica was granted its Royal Charter in the 13th century, the \\"Square burghers\\" (Ringbürger in German, circulari in Latin) with residences at the Square attained special privileges among the citizens of the royal free town (a self-governing municipality outside the county jurisdiction − directly under the monarch and with its own representation in the Diet).Marián Skladaný, \\"Zápas o banskobystrickú meď v polovici 15. storočia.\\" Zborník Filozofickej fakulty Univerzity Komenského, Historica, 1976.

Budapest formalized the name in its Hungarian version (Fő térThe name still occasionally occurs in Hungarian sources, e.g., Csaba György Kis, \\"Besztercebánya, Fő tér.\\" Magyar Nemzet, 28 Sept. 2006.) in the 1860s as part of a drive to assign Hungarian names to all the country's localities, and emphasized history in 1886 by renaming it \\"King Béla IV Square\\" (Hungarian: IV.

By 1923 it had already been renamed \\"Masaryk Square\\" (Masarykovo námestie) after the country's first president Tomáš Masaryk, shortly after Czecho-Slovakia (soon unhyphenated as Czechoslovakia) was created in 1918. The square saw a massive gathering to celebrate the new statehood during President Masaryk's visit in 1923.Alexandra Bitušíková, \\"Premeny funkcií námestia ako priestoru spoločenskej komunikácie.\\" Etnologické rozpravy, 1995.

On 29 August 1944, Banská Bystrica became the center of the Slovak National Uprising against the country's totalitarian government and its alliance with Germany, the most extensive revolt in Western and Central Europe during World War II. The square became an assembly area for the insurgency. After the suppression of the uprising, President Jozef Tiso arrived at the square in October 1944 for an approbatory ceremony to decorate German soldiers who defeated the Slovak insurgents.Jim Downs, World War II: OSS Tragedy in Slovakia. 2004. =SNP Square= When Slovakia was reincorporated in a truncated Czechoslovakia in 1945, the square was first renamed \\"National Uprising Square\\" (Námestie Národného povstania), and eventually \\"Slovak National Uprising Square\\" (Námestie Slovenského národného povstania). The name has remained unchanged through the present. The square was the site of massive commemorations of the event staged by the Communist authorities once every five years for much of their rule.

Buildings The square is dominated by a clock tower built in 1552. Although less known than its famous counterpart in Pisa, it is a leaning tower with the top 40 centimeters (16 in.) off the perpendicular. It hosts the main antenna that makes all of SNP Square a free WiFi hotspot provided by the city. A plague column (Slovak: Morový stĺp) was erected in the square in the 18th century in gratitude to the Virgin Mary for ending a deadly plague. The column was temporarily removed before a visit of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1964 because a religious symbol was considered too embarrassing a background for the Communist leader's speech. The St. Francis Xavier Cathedral (Slovak: Kapitulský kostol, \\"Chapter Church\\") is a copy of the Jesuit Church of the Gesu in Rome and has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Banská Bystrica since 1776. Thurzo House hosts the historical exposition of the Museum of Central Slovakia (Slovak: Stredoslovenské múzeum), the oldest museum in the city. Other major monuments on the square include an Art Nouveau fountain from the beginning of the 20th century and a black obelisk raised to the honor of the Soviet soldiers killed during the liberation of the city in 1945.

There is a great deal of confusion in the documentation of de Espinosa's life and works because there are a number of artists using the same name who also painted still lifes around the same time. Early life Juan de Espinosa, gilder of altarpieces, was documented in Madrid between 1608 and 1613, married Maria de Aranda in the parish of San Sebastián. The second son of this marriage, born in 1610 and also named Juan, might be the better known of the two still-life painters of this name. The greatest of still-life painters Espinosa was signing his works Joanes Bapta. Despinosa faciebat Anno D’1624. A still life of silver pieces, using the same formula he used in 1612, was submitted to join the brotherhood of the Sacrament of the parish of San Sebastian in Madrid. In uncertain date valued the altarpiece of the parish of Alcaudete de la Jara. Little else is known about him except that he had died already in 1641 when his widow made a will. Stylistically a painter closely associated with the work of Juan van der Hamen, with the same sense of order and symmetry. The second, younger, still active in 1659, Juan de Espinosa signed the letter of dowry the painter Francisco de Burgos Mantilla in 1645, the same date wearing a still life of flowers and fruits, The Louvre Museum, signed in the same way. This is a free painter of bright colors and strong lighting applied to complex compositions. In the same hand as the Louvre are two separate oil fruit still life Museo del Prado and the dead bird life with the Museum of Córdoba, from three of the royal collections, all of which shows the same precious treatment of grapes, made based glazes, clear red and intonation. More complex is the relationship established between the individual parts still life with grapes octagonal, signed in 1646, entered in 2006 at the Museo del Prado, which again appears a dead bird, but now in a diagonal, between bunches of grapes, pears, apples, some dried fruit and Mexican red clay pileup similar to that used in the still life of the Louvre. The detailed treatment and also fresh fruit, particularly grapes, which seem to receive the light from within, and the use of back to profile branch leaves, approximates stylistically the work of this painter to the work of Juan Fernandez, Labrador. Other same name Still another Juan de Espinosa was a known contemporary painter who died in 1653 in San Millán de la Cogolla, while working on the paintings of the cloister, painter of religious works discreet respect for tradition chiaroscuro.

The PCG traces its roots to the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), founded by Herbert W. Armstrong (1892–1986). The PCG was founded by Gerald Flurry with the stated purpose of continuing Armstrong's teachings, which were re-evaluated and subsequently rejected by the WCG after Armstrong's death, as it came to accept mainstream evangelical Christian teachings, such as the Trinity (the triune nature of God as one Being in three distinct Persons). Armstrong had rejected the Trinity doctrine in favor of the view that God is not one but two separate God-beings (i.e., the God Family or the Family of God) into which Family, according to Armstrong, humans, \\"upon true conversion and spiritual growth\\", may be born. How God Planned to Reproduce Himself!Cottrell, Jack \\"What the Bible Says About God the Redeemer\\" Wipf and Stock (2000) p. 139 The PCG asserts that it is carrying on Armstrong's legacy after the doctrinal changes made by the new WCG leaders, namely Joseph W. Tkach and his son, Joseph Tkach Jr., and also teaches new revelation that Gerald Flurry claims has been shown by God from the Bible since Armstrong's death. Founder Gerald Flurry is Pastor General of the Philadelphia Church of God and Editor-in-Chief of 'The Trumpet' news magazine; which he began publishing in 1990. He is also founder and chairman of the 'Armstrong International Cultural Foundation' and founder and Chancellor of 'Herbert W. Armstrong College' in Edmond, Oklahoma, USA. He has been an ordained minister for over 35 years and formerly served as a pastor in the Worldwide Church of God, from which he was disfellowshipped (excommunicated) on December 7, 1989, \\"for resisting sweeping doctrinal changes.\\" He had alerted the WCG ministry and members of those changes via his booklet 'Malachi’s Message,' after which he and his assistant, John Amos, were fired. https://www.pcog.org/about/gerald-flurry. Gerald Flurry then immediately founded his own organization, the Philadelphia Church of God. Place of Safety He wrote in 2018 that the PCG must be \\"prepared to go to the cave of Adullum, the place of safety. Make this part of your thinking... We must get our minds conditioned to do that!\\" He explained that there, a \\"converted\\" man in the PCG (a descendant of King David), an \\"apostle\\", will sit as a king on a throne. \\"In the PCG, THERE IS A KING who is led and directed by God!\\" https://www.thetrumpet.com/literature/read/17248-the-new-throne-of-david/2003 Media projects PCG sponsors media projects (including television shows and regular publications) to preach its message and to continue the legacy of Herbert W.

Early life Luman Walters was born in Winchester, Litchfield County, Connecticut, to John Walter and Sarah Gleason around 1789. Sometime between 1798 and 1800, the Walter family relocated to Burke, Vermont, a town founded by Luman's uncle.. Digital reprint at Ancestry.com Walters was reportedly the \\"son of a rich man living on the Hudson\\". He had \\"received a scientific education\\" and studied in Paris. Alva Beaman's daughter recalled that \\"After he came home he lived like a misanthrope. He had come back an infidel, believing neither in man nor God.\\"Quoted in D. Michael Quinn \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View\\" p117 At a debate in the 1880s, Clark Braden alleged that Walters had mastered the arts of animal magnetism and Mesmerism.Discussed in Quinn p120\\"While acting in his primitive supernatural capacity as water witch and money digger, Smith made the acquaintance of a drunken vagabond by the name of Walters who had been a physician in Europe. This person had learned in Europe the secret of Mesmerism or animal magnetism.\\" Walters returned to the United States by 1818 and began acting the part of a physician and occult expert.On both the 1850 and 1860 census reports for Gorham, Ontario County, New York, Walters's profession is listed as physician. Parfitt's genealogy lists his profession as \\"eclectic physician.\\" This description may refer to Walter's practice of Thomsonian medicine, which was practiced by other prominent Mormons. See eclectic medicine. In that year, James Giddings, the deputy sheriff of Boscawen, New Hampshire, offered a reward for the arrest of a \\"transient person, calling himself Laman Walter, [who] has for several days past been imposing himself upon the credulity of the people in this vicinity by a pretended knowledge of magic, palmistry and conjuration\\". Walters was arrested for \\"juggling\\" that August in Hopkinton, New Hampshire, but escaped from jail.Concord Gazette, September 1, 1818; New Hampshire Patriot, September 1, 1818. In November 1819, Walters married Harriet Howard in Vermont. By 1822, Walters had apparently taken up residence in Gorham, Ontario County, New York. In Mormonism In 1822 and 1823, Walters served as a seer for a treasure dig on the property of Abner Cole in Palmyra, Wayne County, New York. Joseph Smith, Sr., Alvin Smith, and Joseph Smith reportedly participated in this dig. Walters possessed a magical book and a seer stone, which he used to locate buried treasure.. Beaman's daughter recalled that Walters was \\"a sort of fortune teller\\" who had been \\"sent for three times ... to dig for treasure\\". Reportedly, Walters \\" pointed out Joseph Smith, who was sitting quietly among a group of men in the tavern, and said \\"There was the young man that could find [the treasure]', and cursed and swore about him in a scientific manner: awful!\\" Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn has argued that Walters crafted the magical parchments owned by the Smith family, and Quinn theorizes that the young Joseph Smith looked to Walters as an occult mentor. According to non- Mormon Pomeroy Tucker, Walters was also one of the early members of Smith's Church of Christ, — lists \\"Luman Walters\\" as one of Smith's earliest followers though official church histories do not record Luman Walter's membership. It is unclear if Luman Walters followed the group when they relocated to Kirtland, Ohio.For Walter's participation in Mormonism, see: Quinn cites a family history which lists Luman Walters as a \\"clairvoyant who moved to Ohio\\".Quinn, Early Mormonism and Magic World View, p 132Parfitt, June (1986). A Genealogy of the Walters Family. Manchester, N.H Walter's second cousin, George Walters, did become a Mormon. Dorothy Walters is listed on the rolls of the first Relief Society in Nauvoo, Illinois.. Her husband, Benjamin Hoyt, was ordered by his bishop to cease using a divining rod, calling other people wizards and witches, and \\"burning boards\\" to heal the bewitched. This decision was upheld by the church's high council, with Hyrum Smith presiding. =Abner Cole's account= Abner Cole, a newspaper editor by profession, printed a parody of the Book of Mormon, the \\"Book of Pukei\\", in his Palmyra paper The Reflector in 1830. This parody described the role of \\"Walters the Magician\\" in these treasure digs, who \\"sacrificed a Cock for the purpose of propitiating the prince of spirits .... And he took his book, and his rusty sword, and his magic stone, and his stuffed Toad, and all his implements of witchcraft and retired to the mountains near Great Sodus Bay\\".Dogberry, pseud. [Cole], \\"Book of Pukei,\\" The Reflector [Palmyra, New York], 1830-06-12, p. 36. Cole also surmised that Joseph Smith worked under the inspiration of \\"Walters the Magician.\\" Abner Cole's non-satirical account, published in the February 28, 1831 Reflector, mentions \\"a vagabond fortune-teller by the name of Walters, who [...] was once committed to the jail of this country for juggling, was the constant companion and bosom friend of these money digging impostors.\\" Cole proposes \\"Walters [...] first suggested to Smith the idea of finding a book.\\". According to Cole, Walters would read, in Latin, from Cicero's Orations, \\"to his credulous hearers, uttering at the same time an unintelligible jargon, which he would afterwards pretend to interpret and explain, as a record of the former inhabitants of America\\" Cole recalls nights where Walters led a band of treasure hunters, \\"and drawing a circle around laborers, with the point of an old rusty sword\\" and \\"sacricides a fowl\\" to \\"the guardian of hidden wealth;\\". Cole recalls that the dig ended in disappointment. \\" =Artemisia Beaman Snow account= Artemisia Beaman was the daughter of Alva Beaman. In the early 1870s, she recalled Walters as the son of a rich man who had been given \\"a scientific education\\" which included being sent to Paris. She recalled that Walters was \\"a misanthrope... an infidel, believing neither in man nor god\\". According to Beaman, Walters was \\"a sort of fortune teller\\". Beaman recalled: :For instance, a man I knew rode up, and before he spoke, the fortune teller said, “You needn’t get off your horse, I know what you want. Your mare ain’t stolen.” :Says the man 'How do you know what I want?' :Says he, “I’ll give you a sign. You’ve got a respectable wife, and so many children. At this minute your wife has just drawn a bucket of water at the well to wash her dishes. Look at your watch and find out if it ain’t so when you get home. As to your mare, she’s not a dozen miles from home. She strayed into such neighborhood, and as they didn’t know whose she was they put her up till she should be claimed. My fee’s a dollar. Be off!” According to Beaman, Walters \\"was sent for three times to go to the hill Cumorah\\". Says Beaman: \\"Each time he said there was treasure there, but that he couldn’t get it; though there was one that could. The last time he came he pointed out Joseph Smith, who was sitting quietly among a group of men in the tavern, and said There was the young man that could find it, and cursed and swore about him in a scientific manner: awful!” =Lucy Mack Smith's 'conjuror'= Lucy Mack Smith, Joseph's mother, recalled a conjuror who tried to find the plates: :\\"My husband soon learned that ten or twelve men were clubbed together, with one Willard Chase, a Methodist class leader, at their head. And what was still more ridiculous, they had sent sixty or seventy miles for a certain conjurer to come and divine the place where the plates were secreted. :The next morning my husband concluded to go among the neighbors to see what he could learn with regard to their plans. The first house he came to he found the conjuror and Willard Chase, together with the rest of the clan. Making an errand, he sat down near the door, leaving it a little ajar. They stood in the yard near the door and were devising plans to find 'Joe Smith's gold Bible.' The conjuror was much animated, though he had traveled sixty miles the previous day and night. :Presently the woman of the house became uneasy at the exposures they were making and, stepping through a back door, called in a suppressed tone loud enough to be heard by Mr. Smith, \\"Sam, Sam, you are cutting your own throat.\\" :At this the conjuror bawled out at the top of his voice, \\"I am not afraid of anybody—we will have them plates in spite of Joe Smith or all the devils in hell.\\" =Brigham Young's 'fortune-teller'= It has been suggested that Walters might be the 'fortune-teller' that Brigham Young referred to on multiple occasions in the 1850s.Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, p132, \\"Luman Walters was undoubtedly the necromancer\\" spoken of by Young In 1850, Young told the General Conference \\"I remember once at the commencement of the church a necromancer embraced it but he could not be satisfied; he came and said he had fingered and handled the perverted priesthood so much, the course I have taken is downwards; the devil has too fast hold of me, I cannot go with you.\\" The Journal of Discourses records an 1855 speech by Young in which he again spoke of a man who \\"was a fortune- teller, necromancer, an astrologer, a soothsayer and possessed as much talent as any man that walked on the American soil, and was one of the wickedest men I ever saw.\\" Young recalled the fortune-teller sought the golden plates and \\"rode over sixty miles three times the same season they were obtained by Joseph Smith.\\" Young recalled that \\"a Baptist deacon and others of Joseph's neighbors were the very men who sent for this necromancer the last time he went for the treasure.\\" Young recalls that \\"When Joseph obtained the treasure, the priests the deacons and religionists of every grade, went hand in hand with the fortune-teller, and with every wicked person, to get it out of his hand, and to accomplish this, a part of them came out and persecuted him\\". Young also recalled that he had \\"never heard a man who could swear like that astrologer; he swore scientifically, by rule, by note. To those who love swearing, it was musical to hear him,\\" Young also spoke of the fortune-teller in 1857: :\\"I never heard such oaths fall from the lips of any man as I heard uttered by a man who was called a fortune teller, and who knew where those plates were hid. He went three times in one summer to get them, —the same summer in which Joseph did get them. Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist priests and deacons sent for him to tell where those plates were, and to get them out of the hill where they were deposited; and he had not returned to his home from the last trip he made for them more than a week or ten days before Joseph got them. Joseph was what we call an ignorant boy, but this fortune teller whose name I do not remember was a man of profound learning. He had put himself in possession of all the learning in the States, —had been to France, Germany, Italy, and through the world, —had been educated for a priest and turned out to be a devil. [...] I never heard a man swear as he did. He could tell that those plates were there, and that they were a treasure whose value to the people could not be told; for that I myself heard him say.\\" Historian Dale Morgan stated that he \\"no longer believe[d] that the conjuror Brigham Young tells of was Walters.\\" In contrast, Quinn argues that Walters is Young's \\"fortune-teller\\", noting that both Cole and Beman refer to Walters as a \\"fortune-teller\\" and that Beman makes special mention of Walters' habit of swearing, not unlike Young's fortune-teller.Quinn, Early Mormonism and Magic World View Later life In 1829, Luman W. Walters was listed as a \\"defaulted debtor\\" in a Sodus civil case brought by Thomas Judgson.D. Michael Quinn \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View\\" p119 The 1830 census lists a Luman Walters in Sodus Township, New York with a wife and five children. In 1834 Walter purchased property in Gorham, New York, and he appears on the census rolls there in 1840. A document by Diedrich Willers Jr. (1820–1908) of Fayette reads: \\"Fortune tellers are consulted as to the future, many in this neighborhood where ever they wish to find out something which is lost or pry into hidden mysteries will consult Dr Walters\\".Quoted in D. Michael Quinn \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View\\" p.119 Walters died on June 2, 1860 at the age of 72. His obituary described him as \\"an eccentric but somewhat successful practitioner in the medical profession\\".

The expenses of coal candle models and other items were defrayed by a monthly subscription of six reales, paid by each member; while students were liberally admitted for the purposes of study, on the payment of whatever fee they could afford. The students had to profess their orthodoxy by stating \\"Praised be the most holy Eucharist and the Immaculate Conception of Our Lady\\". In school, conversation on subjects irrelevant to the subjects of the school was prohibited, and the offender was fined if he persevered in it, after the president had rung his bell twice. Swearing, profane language, and offences against good manners were also fined. After a brief dip in students, by 1673, the academy had 43 members. The academy was not successful in fostering students that ever matched in eminence those of the Academy's founders.

Anthony List (SBA List) is a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization that seeks to reduce and ultimately end abortion in the U.S. by supporting anti-abortion politicians, primarily women,Electing , Susan B. Anthony List website; accessed June 17, 2014. through its SBA List Candidate Fund political action committee. Founded in 1993 by sociologist and psychologist Rachel MacNair, the SBA List was a response to the success of the abortion rights group EMILY's List, which was partly responsible for bringing about the 1992 \\"Year of the Woman\\", in which a significant number of women who favored abortion rights were elected to Congress. MacNair wished to help anti-abortion women gain high public office. She recruited Marjorie Dannenfelser and Jane Abraham as the first experienced leaders of SBA List. Dannenfelser is now president of the organization and Abraham is chairwoman of the board. Named for suffragist Susan B. Anthony, SBA List identifies itself with Anthony and several 19th-century women's rights activists. SBA List argues that Anthony and other early feminists were opposed to abortion, a view that has been challenged by scholars and abortion-rights activists. Anthony scholar Ann D. Gordon and Anthony biographer Lynn Sherr write that Anthony \\"spent no time on the politics of abortion\\". Founding The formation of the SBA List was catalyzed in March 1992 when Rachel MacNair, head of Feminists for Life, watched a 60 Minutes television documentary profiling IBM-heiress Ellen Malcolm and the successful campaign-funding activities of her Democratic abortion-rights group EMILY's List. MacNair, a peace activist and anti- abortion Quaker, was motivated to organize the Susan B. Anthony List for the purpose of countering EMILY's List by providing early campaign funds to anti- abortion women candidates. Led by FFL and MacNair, 15 anti-abortion groups formed an umbrella organization, the National Women's Coalition for Life (NWCL), which adopted a joint anti-abortion statement on April 3, 1992. Also inspired by EMILY's List, in 1992, the WISH List was formed to promote Republican candidates who favored abortion rights. In November 1992, after many of the candidates who favored abortion rights won their races to create what was termed the \\"Year of the Woman\\", MacNair announced the formation of the SBA List, describing its purpose as endorsing and supporting women who held anti-abortion beliefs without regard to party affiliation. MacNair determined to challenge the EMILY's List and the WISH List notion that the top female politicians primarily supported abortion rights. She said the SBA List would not support right-wing political candidates. \\"We want good records on women's rights – probably not Phyllis Schlafly\\". The NWCL sponsored the SBA List with $2,485 to create it as a political action committee (PAC)The SBA List was formed as a political action committee with the Federal Election Commission identification number C00280057. on February 4, 1993, listing MacNair as the first secretary; the group operated out of MacNair's office inside a crisis pregnancy center on East 47th Street in Kansas City, Missouri. The first SBA List public event was held the same month at the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the National Woman's Party. Organized by founding board member Susan Gibbs, the \\"kickoff\\" event raised \\"more than $9000\\". =Susan B. Anthony and early feminist connection= MacNair named the SBA List after the famous suffragist, Susan B. Anthony. The leaders of the SBA List say that Anthony was \\"passionately pro-life\\".\\"Susan B. Anthony: Pro-life Feminist\\", The Washington Post, May 2010; accessed June 17, 2014. According to Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the SBA List, Anthony \\"referred to abortion as 'the horrible crime of child murder.Whitehead, D. (2011). \\"Feminism, Religion, and the Politics of History\\". Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, 27(2), 3-9. The portrayal of Susan B. Anthony as a passionate opponent of abortion has been subject to a modern-day dispute. The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House said, \\"The List's assertions about Susan B. Anthony's position on abortion are historically inaccurate.\\" Anthony scholar Ann D. Gordon and Anthony biographer Lynn Sherr said that \\"Anthony spent no time on the politics of abortion. It was of no interest to her.\\" They said the \\"child-murder\\" quote attributed to Anthony actually appeared in an article written anonymously by someone else and that other quotes attributed to Anthony have been misattributed or taken out of context. Gordon said that Anthony \\"never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life ... and she never voiced an opinion about using the power of the state to require that pregnancies be brought to term\\". The Anthony Museum and House provided evidence for the idea that the author of the \\"child-murder\\" article was a man. The \\"child-murder\\" article appeared in Anthony's newspaper and was signed \\"A\\". According to Ward, Susan B. Anthony signed her articles as \\"SBA\\". Ward said that another article in her newspaper that was signed \\"A\\" took issue with one of its editorials, generating a discussion in which the editors referred its author as \\"Mr. A.\\" History =Early activities and re-organization= Founding board member Susan Gibbs, later the communications director for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, said, of the early years for the SBA List, \\"None of us had political experience. None of us had PAC experience. We just had a passion for being pro-life.\\" Shortly after its founding, experienced political activists Marjorie Dannenfelser and then Jane Abraham were brought on board — Dannenfelser served as executive director, leading the organization from her home in Arlington, Virginia. In 1994, the SBA List was successful in helping 8 of its 15 selected candidates gain office. In 1996, only two challengers who were financially backed were elected, while five SBA-List-supported incumbents retained their positions, a disappointing election for the group. In 1997, the SBA List was re-organized by Dannenfelser and Abraham into its current form as a 501(c)(4) non-profit organization with a connected PAC, the SBA List Candidate Fund. Abraham became president and Dannenfelser held the position of Chairwoman of the Board. The rules for endorsing and financially supporting candidates were tightened: in addition to the politician having to be female, she must have demonstrated an anti-abortion record (a simple declaration was not enough), and she must be seen as likely to win her race. In 1998, the SBA List began backing male anti-abortion candidates as well, endorsing three men in a pilot program. One of the three won election to office: Republican Peter Fitzgerald who received $2,910 from the SBA List to assist him in his $12.3 million win over Democrat Carol Moseley Braun in a battle for the U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. Abraham served as president from 1997 until 2006 when Dannenfelser became president. In 2000 the SBA List contributed $25,995 to its favored candidates, in contrast to the WISH List and EMILY's List, which contributed $608,273 and $20 million, respectively, to their favored candidates. =Recent history= Contributions from supporters grew by 50% from 2007 to 2009.\\"Health Bill Revives Abortion Groups\\", New York Times, November 24, 2009.

Stupak was stripped of his \\"Defender of Life Award\\" three days before the gala because of the SBA List's doubts, shared by the most prominent anti-abortion groups, about the effectiveness of the Executive Order.\\"Stupak Award Rescinded\\", CNN, Mar. 22, 2010\\"Stupak Stripped of 'Defender of Life' Award He Was to Receive this Week\\", The Hill Stupak had told Dannenfelser, \\"They [the Democratic leadership] know I won't fold.

In a statement, Dannenfelser said, \\"We were planning to honor Congressman Stupak for his efforts to keep abortion-funding out of health care reform. We will no longer be doing so...Let me be clear: any representative, including Rep.

The group dropped its plans to help Stupak fend off a primary challenge from Connie Saltonstall, who decided to challenge Stupak on the basis of his anti-abortion views. Stupak later dropped out of the race, announcing his retirement from Congress. In 2010, the SBA List hosted events featuring prominent anti-abortion political figures as speakers, including Sarah Palin, Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and Rep.

In response, Planned Parenthood launched its own tour to follow the SBA List bus. The SBA List also bought $200,000 in radio and television ads backing six Republicans who voted to defund Planned Parenthood in response to a $200,000 ad buy by Planned Parenthood against the Pence Amendment.\\"Planned Parenthood, Susan B.

Strategies  The SBA List employs many strategies in order to attract the public to its mission. Lawyer and Scholar Tali Leinwand explains that the SBA List encourages Republicans not to endorse personhood amendments, and attempts to link the anti-abortion movement to less controversial causes like opposition to the Affordable Care Act. These strategies, Leinwand argues, attempt to de- stigmatize the anti-abortion movement. Elections = 2006 elections = The 2006 midterm elections were very successful for the SBA list.

Driehaus persuaded the billboard company to withdraw the SBA List's advertisement, which was never erected. Driehaus lost the seat to Steve Chabot, the incumbent whom Driehaus had defeated two years earlier, in the November general election.

Jill Vogel in an effort to flip control of the state Senate, which the group described as a \\"graveyard for pro-life legislation\\". It also announced it was spending $25,000 against Sen.

Candidates Rick Perry, Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Thaddeus McCotter, Herman Cain, and Ron Paul all signed the pledge, but Mitt Romney, Jon Huntsman, Jr., and Gary Johnson declined.

In August, SBA released an ad featuring anti-abortion activist Melissa Ohden who says she survived an abortion in 1977. The ad criticized Barack Obama, saying that while serving in the Illinois Senate, he voted four times to deny medical care to infants born alive during failed abortion procedures. In a 2008 analysis, FactCheck drew a mixed conclusion overall, finding both the SBA List and Obama had made misleading and/or inaccurate comments regarding Obama's voting record on the topic in question while he served in the United States Senate. =2013 Virginia gubernatorial election= The SBA List made the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election a priority for 2013, endorsing Ken Cuccinelli and pledging to spend $1.5 million in the election through its Virginia PAC, Women Speak Out.

He is a bald, yellow-skinned, bespectacled, lab-coated scientist who presented periodic science segments from \\"Muppet Labs, where the future is being made today.\\" The character has no eyes, only completely transparent, lensless glasses, giving the appearance of a stereotypical absent-minded intellectual. His first name is derived from Robert Bunsen, after whom the Bunsen Burner was named. His last name is a reference to the honeydew melon, which his head is virtually shaped like. It is also a reference to Honeywell Labs, a technology company which aired TV commercials (\\"That someday is today ... at Honeywell\\") well-known at the time of the original Muppet Show. Honeydew's experiments usually cause great harm to his very nervous and long- suffering assistant Beaker, a nearly mute Muppet with a shock of reddish hair. Honeydew worked alone in the first season of The Muppet Show but, from the second season onward, the luckless Beaker was always present. Some of the inventions that were created and tested included: edible paper clips, dish tenderizer, exploding hats, a gorilla detector, hair-growing tonic, banana sharpener, a robot politician (played by Peter Ustinov) and an electric nose warmer. In response to the ancient quest of alchemy to turn lead into gold, Honeydew created a device that turned gold into cottage cheese. Appearance Dr. Bunsen Honeydew's moniker is derived from the traditional piece of lab equipment, the Bunsen burner, plus the fact that his head was shaped and colored like a honeydew melon. He was rumored to be modeled after Lew Grade, whose company ITC Entertainment produced The Muppet Show. Henson responded in a Judy Harris interview: One of his most endearing features is his lack of visible eyes, despite the fact that he wears glasses. Occasionally, Honeydew removes his glasses to clean them, or lifts them as if to get a better look at things, which is something of a running gag. Bunsen's eyes have only been seen once, during a sequence in The Great Muppet Caper. Films where he appeared in major roles include The Muppet Movie (1979), The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992), Muppet Treasure Island (1996), Muppets from Space (1999), It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie (2002), and The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (2005) with Beaker. He also appeared in a small supporting role with Beaker in The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa (2008), though in The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984) Bunsen and Beaker only appeared as background characters in the wedding scene. A scene with them was deleted. In the Halloween 2011 episode of WWE Raw, Bunsen developed a specially formulated energy drink that provides strength, agility and fresher smelling breath to those who take it. He had Beaker go deliver it to Santino Marella for his match against Jack Swagger. The duo appear in the 2011 feature film The Muppets, where they have been apparently working at CERN with the Large Hadron Collider after The Muppet Show ended. Their big CERN scene was deleted, as well as a scene with a bowling ball, leaving them with a minor role in the film. Both Bunsen and Beaker appear in the follow-up feature film Muppets Most Wanted (2014) with a substantially larger role than the previous film and are in a supporting role including a featured invention of theirs, a big bomb- attracter vest. Bunsen and Beaker also appear in the 2015 TV series The Muppets, as the heads of the props and special-effects department, and in Muppets Now as the hosts of “Muppet Labs Field Test” Fictional biography Bunsen graduated from Carnegie Mellonhead University (a spoof of Carnegie Mellon University) and was employed as an assistant to Dr. Pinhole Burns. He is the founder of Muppet Labs. Both scientists were later incorporated into the Muppet Babies animated series. Howie Mandel and Dave Coulier voiced Bunsen, and Frank Welker provided Beaker's squeaky meeps. Bunsen made an appearance in Little Muppet Monsters voiced by Bob Bergen. Following Richard Hunt's death in 1992, the role of Beaker was taken over by Steve Whitmire. Whitmire performed that role until 2016. In a 2004 Internet poll sponsored by the BBC and the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew were voted Britain's favourite cinematic scientists. They beat Mr. Spock, their closest rival, by a margin of 2 to 1 and won 33 percent of the 43,000 votes cast.

The desert is located in the interior, about north of the provincial capital, Almería, in the Tabernas municipality. Due to its high altitude and inland location, it has slightly higher annual rainfall (more than 200 mm per year) and lower annual average temperature than coastal areas of Almeria. It is a nature reserve (protected area) spanning . Climate A sunrise in the Tabernas Desert The Tabernas Desert has various types of climates; from the hot desert climate and hot semi-arid climate in a few lowland areas to the cold desert climate and the cold semi-arid climate in most of the desert. The Tabernas Desert is situated between the Sierra de los Filabres to the north and the Sierra de Alhamilla to the south-southeast, isolating it from the humid winds of the Mediterranean Sea, in an area with little rainfall known as Levante. In the lowest areas of the Tabernas basin (about 400 meters above sea level), the average annual temperature is of about 18.0 °C. Temperatures in winter rarely drop below freezing at night while during the summer, absolute maximum temperatures can sometimes surpass 40 °C (104 °F) in the shade. The annual average precipitation is between 15-22 cm (depending on the zone, see same source pages 1 & 4/30) with only 1/3 falling in the hot season (May to October). The average annual sunshine is about 3000 hours. Thus the climate, between 400 and about 800–900 meters, is semi-arid of \\"Syrian\\" type (see Georges Viers, Éléments de climatologie, Paris, Nathan, 1990) which means that the dry season occurs during the hot season (= 6 hottest months of the year). This characteristic is also aggravated by the foehn effect. Above about 800–900 meters the precipitation increases, thus reducing the dry summer season, while the temperature drops. At these altitudes, the Tabernas basin climate is not semi-arid any more but Mediterranean. Panoramic view of Tabernas Desert from A-92 (GPS 37.016773 -2.446092) Geology and biology Panorama The little rainfall that occurs is usually torrential, so that the ground, consisting of marls and sandstone with little vegetation, is unable to retain moisture. Instead, the rain causes erosion, forming the characteristic landscape of badlands. Arroyos formed by torrential rain harbor the scarce vegetation, as well as fauna such as swifts, hedgehogs, jackdaws, pin-tailed sandgrouse, blue rock thrushes, stone curlews, trumpeter finches, and crested larks. Flora and fauna The desert is well endowed with vegetation for a desert. Plants such as the sea lavender (Limonium insignis), which are teetering on the verge of extinction, manage to flourish in the semi-arid environment of the desert. In winter, the landscape of the desert turns white when the toadflax linaria (Nigricans lange) flowers. There are specimens of yellow scorpions (Buthus occitanus), tarantulas (Lycosa tarentulla) and black widows (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus) although it's not deadly as the American black widow. Coastal areas have lesser weevers such as Echiichthys vipera and Tachinus dracco, which usually live under the sand. =Reptiles and amphibians= The reptilian population of the desert includes ladder snakes, spiny-footed lizards and ocellated lizards. Marsh frogs, natterjack toads and terrapins inhabit the moist areas of the desert. File:Rhinechis scalaris cropped.jpgA ladder snake File:Timon Lepidus danelu.jpgOcellated lizard =Birds= Birds of prey such as the Bonelli's eagles and peregrine falcons roam the desert's skies. Lesser hunters include kestrels and eagle owls. Species such as the blue rock thrush, rock sparrow, rock bunting inhabit the rocky areas of the desert whereas warblers, goldfinches, golden orioles and serins prefer the ramblas near the dry river beds.

The refuge, established in 1939 to protect desert bighorn sheep, encompasses over of the Yuma Desert region of the Sonoran Desert. Broad, gently sloping foothills as well as the sharp, needlepoint peaks of the Kofa Mountains are found in the rugged refuge. The small, widely scattered waterholes attract a surprising number of water birds for a desert area. A wide variety of plant life is also found throughout the refuge. History The name Kofa comes from a former area gold mine: the King of Arizona mine (active from 1897 to 1910), with Kofa a contraction of the name. In 1936, the Arizona Boy Scouts mounted a statewide campaign to save the bighorn sheep, leading to the creation of Kofa. The Scouts first became interested in the sheep through the efforts of Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the noted frontiersman turned conservationist who co-founded ScoutingRoosevelt Council Resolution, November 19, 1947 Burnham observed that fewer than 150 of these sheep lived in the Arizona mountains. He called George F. Miller, then scout executive of the Boy Scout council headquartered in Phoenix, with a plan to save the sheep. Burnham put it this way: > I want you to save this majestic animal, not only because it is in danger of > extinction, but of more importance, some day it might provide domestic sheep > with a strain to save them from disaster at the hands of a yet unknown > virus. Several other prominent Arizonans joined the movement and a \\"save the bighorns\\" poster contest was started in schools throughout the state. Burnham provided prizes and appeared in store windows from one end of Arizona to the other. The contest-winning bighorn emblem was made into neckerchief slides for the 10,000 Boy Scouts, and talks and dramatizations were given at school assemblies and on radio. The National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League, and the Audubon Society joined the effort. On January 18, 1939, over were set aside at Kofa and at Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge combined, and a civilian conservation corps side camp was set up to develop high mountain waterholes for the sheep. On April 2, 1939, Kofa National Wildlife Refuge was officially opened; Burnham gave the dedication speech. The desert bighorn sheep is now the official mascot for the Arizona Boy Scouts, and the number of sheep in these parks have increased substantially. The Kofa Game Range, as it was called, was originally administered jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management. On February 5, 1975, Kofa was transferred exclusively to the Bureau of Land Management. But in 1976 complete authority was returned to the Department of Fish and Wildlife Services and the Kofa Game Range was renamed the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge.US Army, Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona 2010 Wildlife The population of desert bighorn sheep was recently estimated to be 428.http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/bhsheep/documents/130107_Kofabighornsheepsurvey2012results_nr.pdf They live mainly in the two ranges that dominate the refuge landscape -- the Kofa Mountains and Castle Dome Mountains of northern Yuma County and southern La Paz County. These mountains are not especially high, but they are extremely rugged and rise sharply from the surrounding desert plains, providing excellent bighorn sheep habitat. In recent years, this herd has provided animals for transplanting throughout Arizona and neighboring states. Other notable wildlife species found in the area include the badger, desert tortoise and kit fox. Bird species that occur at Kofa include the white-winged dove, American kestrel, northern flicker, Say's phoebe, cactus wren, phainopepla, and orange-crowned warbler. In recent years, the cougar has established a full-time presence in the park. Plants The Kofa Mountain barberry, Berberis harrisoniana, a rare plant endemic to southwestern Arizona, occurs on the refuge. It is also home to the desert fan palm (Washingtonia filifera), the only native palm in Arizona.

These are rare in Arizona and are likely relicts of a geological period when the area was wetter and cooler. Visiting The turnoff for Palm Canyon is located at Milepost 85 on US Highway 95. A parking area is about eight miles east down a gravel road. Half a mile down the trail is a sign indicating the California fan palms. The hike to the canyon is short but strenuous. The refuge provides opportunities for viewing desert plants and wildlife, rock climbing, exploring old mines, and remote wilderness camping. Temperatures often exceed 120 °F (49 °C) in the summer, and rain falls only a few times per year. Regulated hunting on the refuge is permitted for quail, bighorn sheep, deer, cottontail rabbit, coyote, and fox. Kofa was included in the desert military training exercises conducted by General George S. Patton during World War II. Unexploded ordnance may be encountered during cross-country hiking.

He was convicted of eleven murders, one attempted murder, seventeen robberies, accomplice of one rape and one attempted rape, one count of sexual abuse, two kidnappings and two thefts. Early life In 1956, when Robledo Puch was four years old, his parents moved the family to Borges Street, Olivos, Buenos Aires, where they rented a first floor apartment above a hardware store. Robledo Puch came from a working class family and was a shy child. Criminal activity On 15 March 1971, Robledo Puch and his accomplice, Jorge Antonio Ibañez, robbed the discotheque Enamor, stealing 350,000 pesos. Before fleeing, Robledo Puch, using a Ruby pistol, killed the owner of the discotheque and the night watchman while they slept. On 9 May 1971 at 4 am, Robledo Puch and Ibañez broke into a Mercedes Benz spare parts store in Vicente López. In one of the rooms, they found a couple with their newborn baby. Robledo Puch shot and killed the man and shot the woman, who only sustained gunshot injuries. Ibañez attempted to rape the injured woman. The woman survived the ordeal and later testified at the trial. Before fleeing with 400,000 pesos, Robledo Puch shot the crib where the newborn lay crying, but he missed. On 24 May 1971, both criminals killed a night watchman in a supermarket. On 13 June 1971, Ibañez raped a 16 year-old girl in the backseat of a stolen car, after which Robledo Puch killed the teenager by shooting her five times. On 24 June 1971, they drove to the same location and repeated the crime - Ibañez attempted to rape a 23 year-old woman, whom Robledo Puch executed afterwards by shooting seven times. On 5 August 1971, Ibañez died in a car accident. Robledo Puch was driving and fled from the scene unscathed. On 15 November 1971, Robledo Puch and his new accomplice, Héctor Somoza, stormed a supermarket in Boulogne and, using a .32 caliber Astra pistol that they had obtained a few days prior in the robbery of an armory, riddled the scene with bullets. Between 17 November 1971 and 24 November 1971, they broke into two car dealerships and murdered the watchmen, stealing over 1,000,000 pesos. Arrest On 1 February 1972, Robledo Puch and Somoza broke into a hardware store. They killed the watchman and tried to open the safe with the keys they obtained from his body. They were unable to do so and, allegedly in a state of confusion during which Robledo Puch apparently was startled by something, he shot Somoza and killed him. In order to impede or prevent identification of the body by police investigators, he took a blowtorch and burned the face of his deceased accomplice. After opening the safe with the same blowtorch, he took the money he found there and fled the scene. He was arrested on 4 February 1972, after his identity card was found in Somoza's pants pocket. He had just turned 20. Trial, reclusion, and present day He was tried in 1980 and sentenced to life imprisonment, the maximum sentence in Argentina, to be served in the high-security prison of Sierra Chica, near the city of Olavarria. The last words he spoke before the court were \\"This was a Roman circus. I was judged and sentenced beforehand.\\" Part of the contents of the file of a psychiatrist who examined him, presented at trial, read: :\\"Robledo Puch comes from a legitimate and complete home, absent from unfavorable hygienic and moral circumstances.\\" :\\"There were also no economic constraints of importance, reverses of fortune, abandonment of the home, lack of work, personal misfortune, illness, affective conflicts, overcrowding or promiscuity.\\" In July 2000, he became eligible for parole; he did not, however, submit a petition. On 27 May 2008, Robledo Puch submitted a petition of request to be paroled. The judge who reviewed his petition denied him parole considering him to still be a threat to society. In November 2013, he requested a review of his sentence or, failing that, his execution by a lethal injection even though the death penalty was not legal in Argentina. The Supreme Court of Justice denied both the request for review and the request for execution, the latter of which would have been illegal. On 27 March 2015, the Supreme Court of Justice rejected an appeal filed by Robledo Puch against the aforementioned judicial decision whereby he was denied parole. , Robledo Puch has spent over 48 years in prison, making him the longest-serving prisoner in Argentina. In 2018, a film based on Robledo Puch called El Angel, directed by Luis Ortega and starring Lorenzo Ferro, was released.

The high-rise building was constructed in 1948-1950 as the Veterans Memorial Building. It stands at in height, with 10 above-ground floors. Architecture The Veterans Memorial Building was designed in the International style by the firm of Harley, Ellington and Day, which also designed the nearby 211 West Fort Street Building and the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center. The building exterior is faced with marble to conform with the master plan of the Civic Center. Windows on the east and west walls are square with a single marble frame extending the length of each floor. The narrow north wall has a high Victory Eagle by sculptor Marshall Fredericks carved in relief over the inscription In honored memory of those who gave their lives for their country. Above the eagle at the roof line are 13 stars. The building was dedicated on June 11, 1950, as the Veterans Memorial Building; it housed offices for city agencies and veterans groups. The main building area contains a 450-seat theater-style conference and a 200-seat lecture hall, both on the ground level. The rear entrance (on the Atwater Street level) also contains a lobby, and another on the second level at the Jefferson Avenue entrance. The Jefferson lobby is above the Atwater lobby. In September 1995, the United Auto Workers and the City of Detroit reached a long-term agreement to lease the structure, after which it was remodeled to house UAW offices. The remodel included adding a large window above the eagle on the North wall. The remodel was completed on 1 October 1997. In 2008, the structure received the Twenty-five Year Award from the Michigan Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. This building is located between Cobo Hall and Hart Plaza. Although its address is on Jefferson Avenue, it is located several feet south of Jefferson on Civic Center Drive. To the west are seven pylons which were also carved by Marshall Fredericks, which depict the founding of Detroit and the ends of several conflicts in which the US played a part.

Price won the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a once-in-a-lifetime book award judged by a panel of British children's writers. The novel was also one of five finalists for the Carnegie Medal from the British Library Association. HarperCollins published the first U.S. edition in 2000. In the next few years it was published in Norwegian, Italian, and German translations.\\"Formats and Editions of The Sterkarm handshake\\". WorldCat. Retrieved 2012-08-05. Plot introduction A British corporation creates a Time Tube back to the 16th Century Scottish-English border, initially planning to exploit its untouched mineral resources. The 21st-century travellers represent themselves as magical Elves, and attempt to win the co-operation of the local clan, the Sterkarms. Title A \\"Sterkarm handshake\\" refers to the treachery of the left-handed Sterkarms, who would offer a right hand to shake in apparent friendship while still wielding a weapon in the left hand. Plot summary The Sterkarm Handshake deals with a British corporation, the FUP, who create a Time Tube back to the 16th Century Scottish-English border, initially to exploit its then untouched mineral resources of gold and oil, though they later plan a tourist resort. They fatally underestimate the natives. A local clan, the Sterkarms, are welcoming at first, regarding the 21st-century travellers as magical Elves because of their medicine and technology, but increasingly refuse to cooperate. The clansmen, who have always lived by plunder, begin robbing the FUPs, which leads to the FUP's power-hungry boss kidnapping the only son of the Sterkarm chieftain. The Sterkarms' retaliation is savage. A young 21st-century anthropologist, Andrea Mitchell, who lives with the Sterkarms as a translator and liaison, finds her loyalties divided when she falls in love with Per Sterkarm. Sequel Price continued the story in A Sterkarm Kiss (Scholastic UK, 2003). FUP contacts the Sterkarms of a different dimension during a subtly different 16th century. The corporation attempts to manipulate them by reigniting a rivalry with another clan. Andrea Mitchell returns to the past but all the people she knew before are now strangers, including her lover Per.

Bills sponsored Michael Craddock was the author of the idea of installing survelliance cameras in Nashville parks that experienced problems with persons committing deviant sex acts. Michael Craddock also sponsored the mobile vendor bill which prohibits selling items in parking lots. During 2006, Craddock sponsored and obtained approval in the Metro Council for a Charter Amendment to be placed on the November 2006 ballot that would allow the people of Nashville to vote for and create the position of independent Auditor. In the November 2006 election, the people of Nashville overwhelmingly approved the charter amendment and by this August for the first time in the history of Nashville we will have a completely independent auditor. Throughout his tenure in the Metropolitan Council, Craddock has consistently criticized waste of the taxpayers' dollar. In June 2009 Michael sponsored and obtained unanimous approval of a ban on booting vehicles. Craddock has been quoted as saying that he intends to introduce legislation to legitimize the practice and add structure to it. Political positions During his time on the council Craddock has been opposed to many issues seen as supportive to the GLBT community. In 2009, Councilman Craddock voted against a non-discrimination ordinance sponsored by Councilwoman Megan Barry that would extend employment protection to gay and transgender city workers. In 2011, Craddock opposed an ordinance that would extend the 2009 NDO to companies that contract with Metro Government. Craddock was also reported to have said he was \\"sick to his stomach\\" at news of a male only strip club coming to Nashville, saying that \\"If Metro council could do something - you're looking at the man who would do it\\". Craddock was a consistent critic of plans to bring a convention center to downtown Nashville using general revenue as bond collateral, asking \\"[h]ow on earth can we justify using tax payer money to build a Convention Center. I’d crawl under the table before I’d tell these people that I’m going to up and raise their taxes.\\" Craddock was skeptical of a 2010 study claiming a large increase in jobs and revenue to the city, saying, \\"[t]his study says we are going to create 1,524 new jobs, its going to cost us $600million to do that, that's about $400,000 per job, I can think of a better way to spend that $400,000.\\" Craddock was a staunch opponent of plans to redevelop the Tennessee State Fairgrounds and Racetrack for commercial purposes, saying \\"[t]he fairgrounds is part of my fabric, my culture. I'm ashamed it's been neglected.\\" May 2010 Criminal Court Race The term- limited councilman sought a new position as Criminal Court Clerk of Davidson County.

August 2011 Mayoral Race On March 31, 2011 Craddock held a kick-off party at his home for his run to replace Karl Dean as Mayor of Nashville, with a central issue being Dean's attempted redevelopment of the Fairgrounds into commercial property. On April 11, Craddock announced that his campaign had raised $14,075 as of April 1, compared to $520,000 cash on hand claimed by the Dean campaign. Faced with lackluster support and unable to raise much money, Craddock withdrew from the race on May 25; Karl Dean was subsequently reelected by a landslide.

The vehicle debuted on the cover of the November 1956 issue of Hot Rod Magazine. The car gained attention but, in the early years of hot rodding, there was considerable street enthusiast interest in the lightweight, high-tech wheels he had custom-designed for the car. Romeo's vision, working from Jim Ellison's small machine shop in San Francisco, along with engineering innovator Tom Griffith, evolved into America's leading aftermarket wheel company. In 1956, they formed American Racing Equipment.\\" Platinum Equity investment group acquired American Racing Equipment Inc in June 2005. American Racing Torq Thrust Wheel Torq Thrust American Racing became famous with the Torq Thrust wheel that, although first applied on the dragstrip, became a popular street racing wheel. The Torq Thrust was specifically designed with a \\"tapered parabolic contour\\" spoke, as opposed to a semi-solid modular design, to increase brake cooling and simultaneously decrease wheel mass. The American Racing Torq Thrust wheel is considered by some as the most famous muscle car wheel of all timeAmerican Racing Wheels and is sometimes credited as starting the entire custom wheel movement. Baja The Baja was one of American Racing's first aluminum truck wheels and remains a great seller to this day. It is a one piece 8 hole design and comes in a polished finish. This wheel is still extremely popular with trucks, Jeeps and other off-road type vehicles and is available in many sizes, offsets and lug patterns. Libre The Libre, sometimes known as the \\"daisy\\" wheel, was a 4-lug, 4-spoke wheel popular with sports car racers, often seen on MGB's and Datsun 510's. Each spoke appeared to bulge slightly in the middle, giving the wheel a robust appearance. These were cast in magnesium for racing and in aluminum alloy for street use. American Racing eventually sold the Libre molds to Shelby American, who marketed the Libre under their own name.

The 200S was popular with Corvette owners and street rod builders. Also, one of the first wheels to go over 200 mph Safely thus came about the 200S name. LeMans The LeMans was another 4 spoke, 4 lug design, cast in sizes and fitments for sports cars such as Alfa Romeo, MGB and Datsun 240Z. Each tapered spoke was wider at the hub than at the rim, giving a lightweight appearance similar to Ferrari wheels of the period. BRE 240Z's used these wheels in SCCA competition, and many street- driven 240Z's followed suit. Silverstone This was AR's take on the 4-lug, 8-spoke British Minilite wheel for sports cars. The main difference was that one side of each spoke was relieved near the hub for lug nut clearance. with the other side of each spoke continuing to the hub circle. These were cast in magnesium for racing and in aluminum alloy for street use.

They make up the majority of the Inner Islands, which in addition include the coral islands along of the rim of the Seychelles Bank, namely Bird Island and Denis Island. The Granitic Seychelles contrast with the Coralline Seychelles or Outer Islands, several island groups made up of low coral islands with dry, infertile soils. The Granitic Seychelles are home to tropical moist forests, with several endemic species, including the coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica), and the jellyfish tree (Medusagyne oppositifolia). Geography Mahé is the largest and tallest island in the Seychelles, at 145 square km and up to 905 m elevation. There are 42 granitic islands, in descending order of size: Mahé, Praslin, Silhouette, La Digue, Curieuse, Félicité, Frégate, Ste.

The Granitic Seychelles are fragments of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, and have been separated from other continents for 75 million years. The Granitic Seychelles form the northernmost part of the Mascarene Plateau. There are mafic xenolith intrusions in the granite in some areas. Flora The native vegetation of these islands consisted of palm, pandanus screw pines, and hardwood forest with mossy, ferny, cloud forest at higher elevations. The flora shows links with both Madagascar to the south and the African mainland to the west. Having been so isolated the islands are rich in endemic plant life including palm trees such as the coco de mer. Fauna The unique lizard and reptile populations of the Seychelles include seven species of caecilian and the iconic giant tortoises, Dipsochelys arnoldi on the Granitic Seychelles, and Dipsochelys dussumieri on Aldabra. There have been some extinctions but the remaining endemic birds of these islands include the Seychelles scops owl (Otus insularis) and the Seychelles paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone corvina). Threats and preservation 200 years of human settlement has seen the removal of much of the ancient habitat (including planting of coconut, vanilla and cinnamon), and the introduction of damaging invasive species.

It is a ball-shaped cactus eventually growing to a cylindrical shape, with spiny ribs and red or yellow flowers in summer. Some sources mistakenly spell the epithet \\"wislizenii.\\" The correct spelling is with one \\"i,\\" per ICN article 60C.2.J. McMeill et al. (eds). 2012. International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. Regnum Vegetabile 154. Koeltz Scientific Books. Characteristics The fishhook barrel cactus typically grows to a diameter of roughly and a height of . However, specimens as wide as and tall as have been recorded.Barrelcactus Cactacae Ferocactus wislizeni. USDA Fact Sheet . The common name comes from the spines, which are thick and hooked. It has a leathery asparagus green cortex (skin) with approximately 15-28 ribs per cactus. Its flowers are yellow to red-orange and appear atop the cactus fruit during the summer months. The fruits are green when unripe, yellow after the flower dries up, and persist atop the cactus long after the flower is gone, sometimes for more than a year. In adulthood, fishhook barrel cacti generally lean southward, toward the sun, earning them the nickname \\"compass barrel cactus.\\" One theory about why this happens is, the afternoon sun is so intense it slows the growth on the exposed side, causing the plant to grow unevenly. Older barrels can lean so far they uproot themselves and fall over, especially after heavy rains when the soil is loose.Mark A. Dimmitt. Cactaceae (cactus family). Arizona Sonora Desert Museum. Its life cycle is 50–100 years. Like Sclerocactus, Ferocactus typically grows in areas where water flows irregularly or depressions where water can accumulate for short periods of time. They are not associated with washes and arroyos but rather grow along rocky ridges and open bajadas. The \\"fishhook\\" spines and the armored web of spines enclosing the cactus body are a defense against herbivory. Rarely a mature barrel cactus is found hollowed out by javelina but overall prickly pear experience much higher levels of damage from more species. Barrel cactus spines pose an extreme hazard for handling, penetrating boots and gloves. The roots are quite long but very shallow. Distribution The fishhook barrel cactus is native to southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. More specifically, it can be found in southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, El Paso County, Texas and northern Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico.US Forest Service. Index of Species Information. SPECIES: Ferocactus wislizenii. It grows in gravelly or sandy soil, more commonly on bajadas than steep slopes, at 1000 to 5300 feet (300–1600 m) elevation. It prefers full sun, and does well in hot arid climates. It is, however, frost-tolerant to 5 °F (-15 °C)Philippe Faucon. Fishhook Barrel Cactus. Desert Tropicals. Ecology The flowers are pollinated by cactus bees (Lithurge spp.). Mule deer, birds, and javelina eat the fruit. The birds especially like the seeds. The people of the Sonoran Desert use the fruit for candy and jelly. The Seri and O'odham eat the flowers and use the fruit, which is sour, as emergency food. Tradition says that the barrel cactus is a source of water for people lost without water in the desert. There are records of the southwestern Native Americans using it for that purpose, but the water contains oxalic acid and is likely to cause diarrhea if ingested on an empty stomach. The skin thickens with age, making older cacti more fire resistant. Even so, average mortality due to fire is 50 to 67 percent within the first two years following fire. In urban areas, the Fishhook Barrel is valued as an ornamental plant. It is drought tolerant and good for xeriscaping, and it is also a low-maintenance full-sun plant.

(; ) are three redactions of chronicles compiled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. All redactions were written in the Ruthenian language and served the needs of Lithuanian patriotism. The first edition, compiled in the 1420s, glorified Vytautas the Great and supported his side in power struggles. The second redaction, prepared in the first half of the 16th century, started the myth of Lithuanian Roman origin: it gave a fanciful genealogy of Palemon, a noble from the Roman Empire who founded the Grand Duchy. This noble origin of Lithuanians was important in cultural rivalry with the Kingdom of Poland. The third redaction, known as the Bychowiec Chronicle, elaborated even further on the legend, but also provided some useful information about the second half of the 15th century. The three redactions, the first known historical accounts produced within the Grand Duchy, gave rise to the historiography of Lithuania. All medieval historians used these accounts, that survived in over 30 known manuscripts, as basis for their publications and some of the myths created in the chronicles persisted even to the beginning of the 20th century. First or short redaction The first or the short redaction (also known as Chronicle of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania or Letopisec Litovskii) was compiled sometime in the 1420s in Smolensk, when Vytautas the Great hoped to be crowned as King of Lithuania. This redaction included the earliest known historical account produced in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: Dis ist Witoldes sache wedir Jagalan und Skargalan, a complaint and memorial written by Vytautas in 1390 during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392). It detailed his power struggles against cousins Jogaila and Skirgaila in 1379–1390 and supported his claims to his patrimony in Trakai and title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. Two translations of this document survive: Latin Origo regis Jagyelo et Witholdi ducum Lithuanie from the 15th century and Russian Litovskomu rodu pochinok from the 14th century. Later this document was expanded to include events up to 1396. It formed the backbone of the first chronicle. The first redaction survived only from later manuscripts and compilations. The earliest known compilation was prepared in Smolensk around 1446 by bishop Gerasim and his clerk Timofei. The compilation also included a praise to Vytautas, written by Gerasim, a story about Podolia, written in 1431–1435 to support the Lithuanian claims against Poland in the Lithuanian Civil War, a description of power struggles between Švitrigaila and Sigismund Kęstutaitis, a short summary of Moscow's chronicles (854–1428), and latest events in Smolensk (1431–1445). The compilation also did not survive in its original state. It is known from several manuscripts: * Supraśl Manuscript, written in the middle of the 15th century and preserved in a 1519 copy found in the Supraśl Orthodox Monastery * Avraamka or Vilnius Manuscript, written by a Smolensk monk named Avraamka in 1495 and found in a Vilnius library * Uvarov or Slutsk Manuscript, written at the court of Olelkovich, prince of Slutsk and descendant of Gediminas, in the 15th century * Academic Manuscript, written in the first half of the 16th century, found in Vologda, and published in 1903, is incomplete * Nikiforov Manuscript, belonged to the Holy Spirit Cathedral in Minsk and was published by in 1898, is incomplete Second redaction The second, more extensive, redaction (also known as Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia) was compiled in the second half of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century (the final version probably came into existence around the 1520s at the court of Albertas Goštautas). The redaction traced back the foundations of the Lithuanian state to the 1st century, when legendary Palemon escaped from Roman Empire and settled at the mouth of Dubysa. He founded the Palemonids dynasty and became the first ruler of Lithuania. This legendary part was then followed by the revised first redaction, detailing the lineage of the Gediminids. Mindaugas, the first King of Lithuania crowned in 1253, and other earlier historically attested dukes were skipped entirely. The elaborate story that Lithuanians were of noble Roman origins had no historical basis and was discarded by modern historians as nothing more than a myth. While many modern historians discount the text as useless, it can still provide useful bits and pieces of Lithuanian history as it incorporates many garbled fragments of earlier, now lost, documents and chronicles. Also, the mythical Palemon is a good evidence of political tensions and cultural ideology of the Lithuanian nobles in the 16th century. This myth served Lithuanian interests in conflicts with Poland and Russia. Poland, then in personal union with Lithuania, claimed that it brought civilization to this barbaric pagan land. By creating fanciful genealogies, linking Lithuanians with noble Romans, the Lithuanian nobility could counter these claims and demand political independence. This redaction rarely included dates and contained several independent stories that were cherished by 19th century nationalists: legends how Gediminas founded Vilnius because of his dreams of Iron Wolf, how Kęstutis took pagan priestess Birutė for his wife, how Vytautas lavishly treated his guests at the Conference of Lutsk in 1429, etc. Among them were some factual stories, including Algirdas' three sieges of Moscow. This format differed significantly from other Slavic chronicles that tended to list inter-related events year-by-year. The second redaction also considerably trimmed and fragmented parts about Ruthenia and Grand Duchy of Moscow; thus the text became primarily about Lithuania. The chronicle was popular and often copied. It shaped the political mentality of the Lithuanian nobility, formed the basis for the Lithuanian historiography until the dawn of the 20th century, and inspired many literary works. Several manuscripts are known: *Krasiński Manuscript, written in the early 16th century, found in a collection of the Krasiński family in Warsaw *Archaeological Society Manuscript, written in the early 16th century *Alševa Manuscript, written in 1550 by a likely native Lithuanian speaker, found in a Chomiński library in *Raczyński or Poznań Manuscript, written around 1580, gifted by Edward Raczyński to Poznań Library *Evreinov Manuscript, written in mid-16th century *Rumyantsev Manuscript, written in the 17th-century, first published by the Rumyantsev Museum in 1902 Third or broad redaction The third and most extensive redaction is known as the Bychowiec Chronicle. It is based on the second redaction. It is believed that this redaction was prepared around the same time as the second redaction with support from Albertas Goštautas. The only known version was discovered in a manor owned by Aleksander Bychowiec and was published in full by Teodor Narbutt in 1846. This chronicle was updated to include events up to 1574. Initially there were doubts if the chronicle is authentic and some suggested that Narbutt falsified it. The doubts were inspired by its sudden discovery and its peculiar similarity with the chronicles of Maciej Stryjkowski; also Narbutt is known to have falsified several other documents. However, new evidence came to light that portions of the chronicle were published in 1830. Historians now suggest that similarity with Stryjkowski's works resulted from using the same document, maybe even the original third redaction, as the source. Further, in 2011, Lithuanian historians discovered a fragment (about one-fifth of the original) of the third redaction at the and published it in 2018. The patriotic themes were even more prevalent than in the second redaction. It continued to elaborate on the Palemon legend: to improve chronology Palemon was moved to the 5th century Rome, devastated by Attila the Hun, and Mindaugas and other historical dukes were incorporated into the legend. It also concentrated more on the Catholic Church than earlier revisions, which paid closer attention to Eastern Orthodoxy. It is an important source for the late 15th century events, especially years of Alexander Jagiellon. Publication The popularity of the Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all of Ruthenia, published by Maciej Stryjkowski in 1582, pushed the old handwritten Lithuanian chronicles into obscurity. They were rediscovered with the advent of professional historiography in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when historians began to critically analyze primary sources to verify various claims. That necessitated the publication of primary sources. The first Lithuanian Chronicle, the Supraśl Manuscript, was published in 1823 by . In 1846, Teodor Narbutt published the Bychowiec Chronicle. Other historians published other manuscripts that they had found. In 1860s, the Archaeographic Commission became interested in collecting and publishing all known manuscripts of the Lithuanian Chronicles. Twelve manuscripts were published in 1907 as volume 17 of the Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles as West Russian Chronicles (), which became the standard reference. The collection, newly compiled and edited by Mikałaj Ułaščyk, was published as volumes 32 (1975) and 35 (1980) of the Complete Collection. However, despite the discovery of several other manuscripts since 1907, the new volumes did not include them.

They are parallel to the natural orientation of collagen fibers in the dermis, as well as the underlying muscle fibers. Langer's lines have relevance to forensic science and the development of surgical techniques. History The lines were first discovered in 1861 by Austrian anatomist Karl Langer (1819-1887),Karl Langer, \\"Zur Anatomie und Physiologie der Haut. Über die Spaltbarkeit der Cutis\\". Sitzungsbericht der Mathematisch-naturwissenschaftlichen Classe der Wiener Kaiserlichen Academie der Wissenschaften Abt. 44 (1861) though he cited the surgeon Baron Dupuytren as being the first to recognise the phenomenon. Langer punctured numerous holes at short distances from each other into the skin of a cadaver with a tool that had a circular-shaped tip, similar to an ice pick. He noticed that the resultant punctures in the skin had ellipsoidal shapes. From this testing he observed patterns and was able to determine \\"line directions\\" by the longer axes of the ellipsoidal holes and lines. Application Knowing the direction of Langer's lines within a specific area of the skin is important for surgical operations, particularly cosmetic surgery. If a surgeon has a choice about where and in what direction to place an incision, he or she may choose to cut in the direction of Langer's lines. Incisions made parallel to Langer's lines may heal better and produce less scarring than those that cut across. Conversely, incisions perpendicular to Langer's lines have a tendency to pucker and remain obvious, although sometimes this is unavoidable. The orientation of stab wounds relative to Langer's lines can have a considerable impact upon the presentation of the wound. Keloids are more common when incision is given across Langer's lines. Sometimes the exact direction of the collagen fibers are unknown, because in some regions of the body there are differences between different individuals. Also, the lines described by Kraissl differ in some ways from Langer's lines, particularly on the face. Alternatives Other authors have created topological skin maps. Kraissl's lines differ from Langer's lines in that while Langer's lines were defined in cadavers, Kraissl's lines have been defined in living individuals. Also, the method used to identify Kraissl's lines is not traumatic.

A Check-list of West Indian Amphibians and Reptiles. Carnegie Museum of Natural History Special Publication No. 1. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 216 pp. (Cyclura carinata bartschi, p. 111). Taxonomy Bartsch's iguana, Cyclura carinata bartschi, was first described by American herpetologist Doris M. Cochran in 1931. It has some minor morphological characteristics which differ from the Turks and Caicos rock iguana, Cyclura carinata. Its specific name, carinata, means \\"keeled\\" and refers to the animal's scalation. Its subspecific name, bartschi, was given in honor of Silesian-American zoologist Paul Bartsch.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Cyclura carinata bartschi, p. 18). Further phylogenic study of mtDNA haplotypes by scientists at Utah Valley State College in 2007, determined that this animal should not be considered a valid subspecies merely upon population isolation and slight morphological differences, but rather that it is genetically, very similar to the Turks and Caicos rock iguana (Cyclura carinata) and that subspecies status should be revoked to include this population in conservation and intra-species breeding. Morphological and genetic data indicate that the closest living relative of C. carinata is C. ricordi of Hispaniola. Anatomy and morphology Measuring less than in total length (tail included) when full grown, Bartsch's iguana, like its parent species, the Turks and Caicos rock iguana, is one of the smaller species of Cyclura. Bartsch's iguana is greenish to brownish-gray, with a yellow dorsal crest, faint yellow-brown reticulations on the bodies of the adults, and a golden iris. Like other members of the genus Cyclura, males of this species have larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. Females have smaller pores, making the animals sexually dimorphic. Habitat and distribution Bartsch's iguana is found only on Booby Cay in the Bahamas. It is estimated that 1,000 of these iguanas live on this small cay and their population appears to be stable, despite the small number. It is rumored that this subspecies once lived on the larger island of Mayaguana and was referred to as the Mayaguana iguana. Diet Like all Cyclura species, Bartsch's iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from different plant species. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insects, mollusks, crustaceans, arachnids, lizards, and carrion. Conservation The Bahamas National Trust has proposed to the Bahamas Government that Booby Cay, which also is a significant area for nesting seabirds, be protected under the national parks system. A program to remove feral goats from the cay has also been initiated. It has been noted that \\"Australian pine\\" trees (Casuarina equisetifolia) introduced by man to the cay may pose a problem as the needles are inedible and their tall size prevents native plants, which the iguanas rely on for food, from growing. In 1998 a colony of these iguanas was established on Mayaguana. This population appears to be stable despite the presence of feral goats on the island.

Career =St Kilda (U19s)= David Granger commenced his football career in Victoria where he played trial games with St Kilda. =Port Adelaide= Granger played for Port Adelaide Football Club in the SANFL between 1975 and 1982. He was a strong, skilled and effective footballer, becoming famously known by his spoonerism nickname, 'Grave Danger'. This was during an era of unprecedented violence in the game and Granger was often employed as an on-field hitman. Over the years he handed out and received countless injuries on the field. Although played nominally as a forward Granger was often sent into defence to harass opposition star forwards. Opposition players often found themselves fearing Granger instead of concentrating on the game, a situation Port Adelaide exploited. In the 1977 Grand Final Granger played a pivotal role as centre half-forward in Port's 8-point victory over Glenelg. In the 1981 Grand Final, also against Glenelg, Granger ended the career of Neville 'Twiggy' Caldwell with a premeditated King hit. As there is no send-off rule in Australian Rules football, Granger continued in the game to lead Port to a 51-point victory. After the match Glenelg protested which resulted in Granger becoming the first footballer in the SANFL to be suspended on video evidence. Granger was later to claim he initially believed Caldwell had died and was \\"terrified\\" by what he had done. In the 1982 preliminary final Port were trailing by 26 points in the second quarter against Glenelg. Port coach John Cahill sent Granger onto the field in the 21st minute of the quarter whereupon Granger was reported by a goal umpire after he King hit Graham Cornes knocking him down as soon as they matched up. Cornes recovered quickly and was awarded a free kick. Cornes was later to blatantly push Granger in the back but the umpire refused to award a free kick. In the third quarter Glenelg back pocket Stephen Barratt had his right leg broken in a \\"collision\\" with Granger (which Granger claims was an accident, though he wasn't sorry that Barratt broke his leg) and Peter Maynard received a bleeding eardrum. Although credited with only one kick and two marks, Granger reportedly had an \\"eerie\\" effect on the game with not only Glenelg players hesitant to match him for fear of missing the final but considerable abuse from the crowd. Port eventually lost the match by one point. As Cahill walked down the stairs of the members' stand he was jeered by the Glenelg supporters in the crowd of 32,339 and Granger had to be escorted from the oval by police. Granger was subsequently suspended for 8 weeks for the Cornes incident and another two for his collision with Barratt which ended his own career. While Granger later claimed that he was sent out to hit Cornes, John Cahill claimed there was no such order and with his career over, Granger felt betrayed by the lack of an admission by Cahill. Cornes for his part has never accepted any apology for the incident (though he has forgiven him), still remembers it bitterly and feels there was no doubt Granger was sent out to target him by the coaching staff. =St Kilda (VFL)= During 1979, Granger played 3 games for St Kilda in the Victorian Football League, kicking 1 goal. =Post Retirement= After retiring from Port Adelaide, Granger moved to Port Pirie to play for Solomontown in the Spencer Gulf Football League. His first game drew a record attendance. In December 2007 Granger was interviewed for the Today Tonight program \\"SA's (20) greatest sporting controversies\\" where his career was listed at number seven. He claimed he was often ordered to take players out, explaining \\"I was a good soldier. I did what I was told.....the culture of football at the time was to win at all costs\\". He insists that the Barratt incident was one of the few times an injury he caused really was an accident. Granger maintains that he was going for the ball when Barratt collided with him. He also recounted how his \\"exile\\" by Port Adelaide after his retirement caused depression and eventually led to an incident where he broke into the Port Adelaide locker room at Alberton Oval and attempted suicide by his old locker. The program's co-compere, Graham Cornes, who was on the receiving end of Granger's playing style in 1982, finished the segment by saying he had forgiven him, commenting, \\"That's Football\\".Top 20 SA Sporting Moments Off-field controversy Granger had struggled off field for a number of years and it was revealed in his court appearances that he battles depression. On 26 December 2001, Granger informed the media that his house would be repossessed by St George Bank who had lodged documents to this effect with the Supreme Court. He had borrowed A$93,000 in 1991 to buy the then-A$150,000 house. In 2003 Granger was finally sentenced to jail after being found guilty of knowingly having cannabis in his possession for the purpose of selling it after 17 kg of cannabis had been found by police in his home. He was sentenced to four years and three months imprisonment. Granger had three previous convictions for cannabis offences in 1991, 1998 and 2002.

The plane was a parasol monoplane with a fabric-covered wing and aluminum hull. Development Initially created to compete for a U.S. Navy contract dated February 28, 1928, the prototype Model 9, XPY-1, was designed by Captain Dick Richardson and Isaac M. 'Mac' Laddon. Beginning construction in March 1928, the aircraft was ready for its first flight by the end of the year. Lieutenant A. W. Gorton made the first flight out of Anacostia NAS, Washington, D.C..Donald 1997, p. 268. The production contract was opened to other bidders, and the Glenn L. Martin Company undercut them and was awarded the contract to construct the plane as the Martin P3M-1 and P3M-2. Three P3M-1s and six P3M-2s were built; one XP2M-1 was also built to a similar design, powered by three Wright Cyclone engines; following the removal of the third engine it was redesignated XP2M-2.Johnson 2011, p. 154. The idea of a third engine on the XPY-1 had been studied and rejected by Navy Bureau of Aeronautics staff.O'Neill \\"A Dream of Eagles\\" page 108, 290 A new contract was placed by the U.S. Navy on May 26, 1931, for a prototype of a developed version of the Model 9, XPY-1, designated the Model 22 Ranger by Consolidated. Incorporating features of the Model 16 Commodore, such as the enclosed flight deck, designated the XP2Y-1 by the Navy, this new prototype had the same 100 ft parasol wing, but became a sesquiplane with a smaller wing mounted lower, at the top of the hull, replacing the booms that had supported the stabilizing pontoons on the XPY-1. Two Wright R-1820-E1 Cyclone engines were located close below the top wing and had narrow-chord cowlings. A third similar engine was mounted on a strut along the centerline above the wing, but was removed after the first test in April 1932. The Navy ordered 23 P2Y-3s as production models similar to the P2Y-2s that were modified from the original batch of P2Y-1s. Operational history The Navy ordered 23 P2Y-1s on 7 July 1931. They were serving by mid-1933 with VP-10F and VP-5F squadrons which made a number of classic long-range formation flights.\\"At least 21 P2Y-1s were modified to P2Y-2s in 1936 and flown by VP-5F and VP-10F until 1938, when they were transferred to VP-14 and VP-15. The first P2Y-3s reached VP-7F in 1935, and this version was flown by VP-4F at Pearl Harbor and in 1939 was in operation with VP-19, VP-20, and VP-21. By the end of 1941, all the P2Y-2s and P2Y-3s had been withdrawn from operational use and were at Naval Air Station Pensacola.

The title of the film is a portmanteau derived from the words religious and ridiculous. The documentary examines and challenges religion and religious belief. Contents A range of views on various world religions is explored as Bill Maher travels to numerous religious destinations including Jerusalem, the Vatican, and Salt Lake City, interviewing believers from a variety of backgrounds and groups. These include a former member of Jews for Jesus, Christians, Muslims, former Mormons, and Hasidic Jews. Maher travels to Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, London, where he \\"preaches\\" Scientology beliefs. Maher also takes a tour around Creation Museum and the Holy Land Experience. Production Maher said he used a fake title \\"A Spiritual Journey\\" for the film to obtain interviews. Creationist Ken Ham of the group Answers in Genesis, who appeared in the film, was critical of what he called Maher's \\"deception\\" to obtain the interview. The documentary was produced by Thousand Words and distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Originally slated for an international release date coinciding with the Christian Easter holiday 2008 (March 23), post-production delays resulting from a screenwriters guild strike pushed the release date back. The film was eventually released on October 3, 2008. Reception =Box office= Religulous had an opening weekend take of $3.5 million from an early October 1 release in Los Angeles and New York City and also a limited 502-theater release, averaging $6,972 per theater. As a result, the film was ranked at #10 at the box office that weekend. Its per-screen receipts were almost three times those of a competing film to which it has been compared in the media, the politically conservative An American Carol, which edged out Religulous to finish at #9 over the same weekend, but had a per theater average of only $2,325. Only the #1 movie, Beverly Hills Chihuahua, at $9,020, had a higher per-screen average than Religulous. For the second weekend, Religulous had a 35.5% drop in box office receipts and dropped to #13 with a gross of $2,200,000 at 568 theaters for a per screen average of $3,873. Religulous grossed over $13 million after having a production budget of $2.5 million. , it is 27th among the highest grossing documentaries in the US and was the highest grossing documentary of 2008. =Critical response= Religulous received mixed to positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69%, based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 6.31/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Religulous is funny and offensive in equal measure, and aims less to change hearts and minds than to inspire conversation.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 31 critics, \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a rating of three and a half out of four stars, and wrote: \\"I report faithfully that I laughed frequently. You may very well hate it, but at least you've been informed. Perhaps you could enjoy the material about other religions, and tune out when yours is being discussed. That's only human nature.\\" Robert W. Butler of The Kansas City Star gave the film a rating of three stars, and commented: \\"The film is one-sided, less a measured argument than a bunch of rants and barbed observations. But it’s also very funny, which trumps everything else.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a rating of A-, and wrote: \\"The movie is funny as...well, hell.\\" The Canadian Press said the movie \\"delivers a laugh-out-loud attack on the most sacred of cows.\\" Christie Lemire, of the Associated Press, wrote: \\"If you're an atheist or an agnostic, you'll be completely on board and happy to tag along with Maher as he travels the globe asking people about their faith — everywhere from Jerusalem to the Vatican to Amsterdam, where he finds not only the Cannabis Ministry but also a Muslim gay bar (with two people in it).\\" John Anderson of Newsday wrote: \\"much that's funny, insightful and thought- provoking. But it certainly doesn't give the religious a lot of slack.\\" The documentary received some negative reviews, with Rick McGinnis of Metro concluding that, \\"Maher is preaching to the choir with an undisguised dishonesty that only the true believers will forgive.\\" James Berardinelli wrote, \\"If the subject of religion is as important to Maher as he claims during his end comments, then he should have followed those words with actions and made a movie that's more than a sum of inauthentic interviews, ranting attacks, and obvious observations. The choir may hum along with Maher but the rest of those watching this movie will be singing the blues.\\" Nick Schager of Slant Magazine called it an \\"atheistic wannabe-dissection of modern faith.\\" In a review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden notes that when Maher \\"turns from evangelical Christianity to Judaism and Islam, its tone becomes uncertain and its rhythm choppy\\".Holden, Stephen (2008-10-01). \\"Believers, Skeptics and a Pool of Sitting Ducks\\", New York Times.

In his review Stephen Holden also wrote that \\"the movie has the same loose, on-the-road structure\\" as Larry Charles' previous film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan and commented: \\"Much of Mr. Maher’s film is extremely funny in a similarly irreverent, offhanded way.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote: \\"those with a taste for irreverent humor and clear-eyed analysis will find it funny, enlightening and disturbing.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter characterized the film as \\"An often hilarious but relentlessly shallow attack on religious fundamentalism by humorist Bill Maher\\". Louis Peitzman of the San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote that \\"It doesn't even matter that he goes out of his way to be offensive, as he's consistently funny enough to pull it off.\\" Scott Indrisek wrote at Style.com that: \\"Religulous earns many of its laughs from skillful editing, with Maher's interviews jazzed up by video clips\\". Ben Kenigsberg of Time Out New York gave the film a rating of three out of six stars, and wrote: \\"The worst scenes in Religulous are appalling for their methods; the best are appalling for their information.\\" Harry Forbes of Catholic News Service condemned the film, deeming it \\"morally offensive.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140401031837/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/movies/08mv156.htm The 3rd Annual Independent Investigative Group IIG Awards presented an award to Religulous recognizing the promotion of science and critical thinking in popular media on May 18, 2009. DVD release Lions Gate Entertainment released the film on DVD February 17, 2009. Special features on the DVD include a commentary with Bill Maher and director Larry Charles, deleted scenes, and extended Bill Maher monologues from around the world that were either edited down or not included in the film at all. Possible sequel On January 4, 2015, Maher tweeted a photo of himself and director Larry Charles with the caption: \\"Director Larry Charles on the Hawaii trip this year...was \\"Religulous II\\" discussed??\\", suggesting the possibility of a sequel.

It is native to two islands to the south of Cuba: Cayman Brac and Little Cayman, which are also known as the Sister Isles due to their similar shapes and close proximity to each other. This subspecies is in decline due to habitat encroachment by human development and predation by feral dogs and cats. It is nearly extinct on Cayman Brac where less than 100 animals live, while Little Cayman supports a population of about 1,500 animals. Taxonomy The Lesser Caymans iguana, Cyclura nubila caymanensis, is only found on the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. It is a subspecies of Cuban iguana. This subspecies has been introduced to Grand Cayman, where it has interbred with that island's endemic blue iguana (C. lewisi). Its specific name, nubila, is Latin for 'cloudy', 'overcast' or 'gloomy'. According to one author the word means \\"gray\\" and in this instance was chosen in 1831 by the British zoologist John Edward Gray as a commemoration of himself, as opposed to the animal's color. Its subspecific name caymanensis refers to the islands where it lives, the suffix -ensis meaning 'of' or 'pertaining to'. Zoologists Thomas Barbour and Gladwyn Kingsley Noble first described the Lesser Caymans iguana as a species in 1916. Chapman Grant, in an article published in 1940, subsumed the taxon as a subspecies of Cyclura macleayi In 1975 Albert Schwartz and Richard Thomas moved taxon to C. nubila, using the trinomial nomenclature, C. nubila caymanensis. It evolved from and will readily interbreed with the nominate subspecies, as well as with Cyclura nubila lewisi. Anatomy and morphology Cyclura nubila caymanensis, captive specimen in Hope Gardens, Jamaica. C. nubila caymanensis is a medium to large animal with an average total length between 30 and 40 inches. Males are significantly larger than females. The Lesser Caymans iguana has a skin color from light grey to green when mature, with a light blue or reddish-pink colored head, whereas females are more olive green, lacking any red or blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint dark bands. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to the rest of their lighter overall body color. Their eye-color is typically brown to blood red. An individual of this subspecies has been recorded as one of the longest lived of all species and subspecies of the genus Cyclura at 33 years. This species, like other species of Cyclura, is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have more prominent dorsal crests as well as larger femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. Distribution and habitat Cayman Islands Native to the islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, this subspecies has been introduced to Grand Cayman. Like other members of the Genus Cyclura the Lesser Caymans iguana requires suitable areas in which to bask, forage, nest, and hide. On Little Cayman these requirements are met in a variety of interior habitats even though the iguanas are widely dispersed. An ongoing population survey on Cayman Brac in 2012 has counted and pit-tagged 86 individuals. One of these was killed by a vehicle in April 2012. There are additional individuals which have been spotted but not yet captured and pit-tagged. Diet Like all Cyclura species the Lesser Caymans iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from over 100 different plant species. This diet is very rarely, if ever supplemented with animal matter. Mating Mating occurs in April to May depending when the dry season ends, and 7-25 eggs are usually laid in May or June depending on the size and age of the female. Due to being forced to dwell inland where the soil is rocky, the females often have to migrate to coastal areas in order to build their nests in the sand. The hatchlings emerge from the nests in August to early September. Conservation =Endangered status= The Lesser Caymans iguana is critically endangered according to the current IUCN Red List endangered species. The subspecies is vital to its native ecosystem as a seed disperser for native vegetation, and its extinction could have serious consequences as many of Little Cayman's and Cayman Brac's plants are not found elsewhere. =Causes of decline= Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening the future of this iguana. The iguanas nest in the sand of beaches that are a prime real-estate location on Little Cayman. Predation and injury to hatchlings by rats, to hatchlings and sub-adults by semi-domestic and feral cats, and killing of adults by roaming dogs are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population on both islands. Sister Island iguanas are all too frequently killed by vehicles. =Recovery efforts= A formal captive breeding program does not exist for this subspecies but it may be warranted for the Cayman Brac population. As the population on Cayman Brac has not been found to be genetically distinct from the Little Cayman population; genetic diversity may be introduced from the Little Cayman population if it is needed. Captivity The Lesser Caymans iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. Private individuals have established these animals in captive breeding programs (both purebred and occasionally mixed with either the blue iguana, Cuban iguana, and sometimes with both) minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade.

The southern terminus is at U.S. Route 209 (US 209) in Jim Thorpe. The northern terminus is at PA 115 in Tunkhannock Township. The route runs through rural areas of the Pocono Mountains, with an interchange with the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 476, I-476) in Penn Forest Township and a junction with PA 534 in Kidder Township. PA 903 is a two-lane undivided road nearly its entire length, besides the I-476 intersection. The route was designated in 1928 between US 209/US 309 in Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe) and a connecting road (now PA 115) south of Blakeslee. The highway was fully paved in the 1930s. Between 2008 and 2015, an E-ZPass-only interchange was constructed with I-476. Route description PA 903 northbound past PA 534 in Kidder Township PA 903 begins at an intersection with US 209 in the borough of Jim Thorpe in Carbon County, heading northeast on two-lane undivided North Street. The road immediately comes to a bridge over the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad's Lehigh Division line, the Lehigh River, and Norfolk Southern's Lehigh Line. After this bridge, the route heads into residential areas. PA 903 continues past more homes with some businesses before turning east into forested areas as an unnamed road. The road heads into Penn Forest Township, running northeast through more forests with some residences and agricultural clearings. The route heads through forested areas with some wooded residential subdivisions, running through Christmans and reaching an E-ZPass-only interchange with I-476 (Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike). PA 903 heads through more dense forests, crossing through a portion of Hickory Run State Park before passing to the west of the residential development of Towamensing Trails. The road crosses into Kidder Township and intersects PA 534. The route heads north at this point and passes through a mix of woods and fields with some development before continuing back into dense forests and turning northeast near the Big Boulder ski resort and Big Boulder Lake to the south of Lake Harmony. PA 903 enters Tunkhannock Township in Monroe County and continues to its northern terminus at PA 115. History When Pennsylvania first designated legislative routes with the Sproul Road Bill in 1911, the present-day alignment of PA 903 was not given a legislative route number. PA 903 was designated in 1928 to run from US 209/US 309 in Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe) northeast to an unimproved connecting road south of Blakeslee. At this time, all the route was unpaved except for a small portion to the northeast of Mauch Chunk. By 1930, the route was paved southwest to East Mauch Chunk while the state highway was under construction northeast to Christmans. The entire length of PA 903 was paved during the 1930s, at which point PA 115 was designated along the intersecting road at the northern terminus. In 1990, plans were made to build an interchange with the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Carbon County. A bill authorizing construction of this interchange was signed into law by Governor Robert P. Casey in July of that year. The proposal for this interchange was cancelled by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission in 1995. In 2006, plans for the interchange between I-476 and PA 903 were resurrected, with the proposed interchange to be all- electronic, in that it will only accept E-ZPass. Construction on the $23 million interchange began in the middle of 2008. The interchange opened to traffic on June 30, 2015.

He was one of the pioneers of the Finnish cinema. Career Karu started his career as a member of a theater troupe in 1907.Uusitalo 1994, p. 21 He became interested in cinema during the 1910s and was reportedly interested in starting his own film company as early as 1915.Uusitalo 1994, p. 22 Karu dabbled in filmmaking, and directed, wrote, edited and produced the comedy short films Ylioppilas Pöllövaaran kihlaus and Sotagulashi Kaiun häiritty kesäloma for Suomen Biografi Oy, both of which were released in 1920.Uusitalo 1994, p. 23 Karu founded the film production company Suomi-Filmi in 1919, which by the end of the 1920s had grown into the largest company in its field in Finland.Uusitalo 1972, p. 148 Karu not only worked as the CEO, but was also the head director for most of his stay in the company. Working to secure the finances of his company, Karu had to wait until 1922 before starting work on his feature-length debut, an adaptation of the Väinö Kataja novel Koskenlaskijan morsian, which saw its release on New Year's Day 1923.Uusitalo 1972, p. 88 The film was a success, as was Karu's next work, the Aleksis Kivi adaptation Nummisuutarit, released in the same year.Uusitalo 1972, p. 92 Because of both the popularity and artistic merit of these works, the year 1923 has been called the pinnacle of Karu's directing career.von Bagh, p. 411 Throughout the rest of the decade and the early 1930s, Karu continued to direct popular films, such as Myrskyluodon kalastaja (1924), Suvinen satu (1925), Muurmanin pakolaiset (1927) and Nuori luotsi (1928).

In an interview, he said that he had waited to resign from the bank until UN sanctions were formally in place, in the meantime delaying requested transfers of Libyan sovereign funds from EU and US accounts to countries likely to ignore the sanctions. He said that as a result 96% of external Libyan funds were blocked, and that the sanctions were extremely effective and were having a major impact on the regime. He went on to describe his current role with the National Transitional Council, essentially trying to maintain banking functions in the free zone, and fostering relationships between the NTC and other countries which will allow central banking to be resumed when the conflict is over. On 16 July, the day after the US recognised the NTC, he gave an interview on behalf of the newly formed association of Libyan bankers, stating that they were collecting data on Libyan foreign resources, and preparing plans for submission to the NTC concerning the restructuring of the Libyan banking sector when the time was right.

It was operated by the United States Navy as a scout trainer with the designation SNC-1 Falcon. Design and development Developed at the Curtiss-Wright St. Louis factory, the CW-22 was developed from the CW-19 via the single-seat CW-21 light fighter-interceptor. The prototype first flew in 1940. With less power and performance than the CW-21, the two-seat, low-wing, all-metal CW-A22 had retractable tailwheel landing gear, with the main gear retracting rearward into underwing fairings. The CW-22 was seen as either a civilian sport or training monoplane or suitable as a combat trainer, reconnaissance and general-purpose aircraft for military use. The prototype CW-A22 Falcon (U.S. civilian registration NC18067) was used as a company demonstrator and is one of four of the type still in existence. An SNC-1 is on display at the U.S. Navy's National Museum of Naval Aviation, at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Operational history The main customer for the aircraft equipped with the Wright R-975 Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine was the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force and 36 were exported. The aircraft had to be delivered to the Dutch in Australia due to the advancing Japanese forces. A developed version, the CW-22B, was sold to Turkey (50), the Netherlands East Indies (25) and in small numbers in South America. Some of the Dutch aircraft were captured and operated by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. The CW-22 and CW-22B were armed with two machine guns, one fixed.Andrade 1979, p. 171. An unarmed advanced training version (CW-22N) was demonstrated to the United States Navy. To help to meet the expanding need for training, the Navy ordered 150 aircraft in November 1940. Further orders brought the total to 305 aircraft which were designated SNC-1 Falcon.Bowers 1990, p. 484. Curtiss converted a CW-19 into a CW-22 demonstrator. They hoped to use this to sell the CW-22 to China. The aircraft was obtained by the Burma Volunteer Air Force, and later used by the Royal Air Force in India. It was scrapped in 1946.

Swamp Fox Road between the township line and PA 316 was originally an unpaved road. In the 1930s, all of Swamp Fox Road was paved except for the portion near Marion Road, which was an improved road. The improved section of the road was paved in the 1940s.

It was best known as a provider of desktops, notebooks, servers and services to customers in the federal, state and local government, education, small and medium business, and consumer markets. Before June 2001, MPC Corporation was known as Micron Electronics Inc., a subsidiary of Boise-based semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology. MPC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 7, 2008, three days after their common stock was delisted from the NYSE Alternext U.S. exchange (formerly the American Stock Exchange). On December 31, 2008, MPC notified the Idaho Department of Labor that its efforts to reorganize had failed and the company would cease operations. History MPC Computers (originally named Micron Electronics Inc.) was founded privately in Nampa, Idaho in 1995 through a merger of ZEOS International, Micron Computer, and Micron Custom Manufacturing. From 1995 to 2001, Micron Electronics Inc. sold consumer and business computers under the names Micron, MicronPC, and MicronPC.com. The acquisition of HostPro (Web.com) in 1999 under CEO Joel Kocher brought the firm into the web hosting space. In June 2001, in an all-stock deal, Gores Technology Group acquired the MicronPC business from Micron Technology. In December 2002, the company changed its name from MicronPC to MPC Computers. In July 2005, application acceleration provider HyperSpace Communications Inc. merged with MPC Computers in a stock- swap deal. Because HyperSpace became a public company in 2004, MPC Computers was able to avoid the rigorous process of becoming a public company. MPC Corporation was listed on the NYSE Alternext US LLC exchange (formerly the American Stock and Options Exchange) as ticker symbol MPZ until being delisted. In January 2007, HyperSpace Communications Inc. changed its name to MPC Corporation. In September 2007, MPC Corporation announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire Gateway, Inc.'s Professional Services Unit business line for approximately $90 million. =Stock delisting= In early May 2008, the AMEX notified MPC that it was not in compliance with AMEX regulations because the company's stockholder equity had fallen below $2 million and that MPC had sustained losses from continuing operations or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years. MPC responded to that notice by filing a plan to achieve compliance which AMEX accepted June 27, 2008, giving MPC until Nov. 9, 2009 to bring itself back to viability under AMEX rules. However, in October 2008 the exchange (which changed its name to NYSE Alternext at the beginning of that month) notified MPC that MPC was not making progress consistent with its submitted plan and said that the plan no longer demonstrated the company's ability to regain compliance with exchange regulations. Exchange officials also concluded that MPC was not compliant with other standards related to the company's overall financial condition and ability to continue operations, its low stock share price and the decline of its market capitalization. =Bankruptcy= In early November 2008, MPC filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In a press release announcing the filing, CEO John Yeros said issues surrounding the integration of the former Gateway unit along with problems with their \\"manufacturing partner\\" contributed to extensive losses. When it gave its shutdown notice to the Idaho Department of Labor, MPC noted that a substantial portion of its sales force resigned without notice between Dec. 4 and Dec. 12, which it said made it impossible to continue viable business operations. It also said that efforts to reorganize under Chapter 11 were unsuccessful and announced it would lay off 147 employees immediately, keeping the remaining 51 employees only to wind down operations. It provided no advance notice of the layoff because \\"the decision to cease all business operations and liquidate the company was not reached until just prior to notice\\" and \\"advance notice of a possible layoff would have precluded its ability to obtain financing to allow the company to avoid a shutdown.\\"  Bowl sponsorship  From 1998 through 2000, MicronPC sponsored the MicronPC Bowl, a post-season NCAA Division I college football bowl game played at Pro Player Stadium in Miami, Florida. In 2000, the bowl was renamed the MicronPC.com Bowl to emphasize the company's internet presence. From 2004 to 2006, MPC Computers sponsored the MPC Computers Bowl, a post-season NCAA Division I college football bowl game played annually at Bronco Stadium on the campus of Boise State University. Before and after the sponsorship of MPC Computers, this bowl game was known as the Humanitarian Bowl; its name was changed to the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl in 2011. Former parent company Micron Technology also sponsored the Humanitarian Bowl (at the time named the Crucial.com Humanitarian Bowl) from 1999 through 2002.

Awdry. This article lists and details episodes from the twelfth series of the show, which was first broadcast in 2008., My DigiGuide – Five schedule This series was originally planned to be narrated by Pierce Brosnan, replacing Michael Angelis and Michael Brandon for the UK and US narrations starting with The Great Discovery, respectively. However, Brosnan withdrew from the series for unknown reasons, and the series was released with Angelis narrating the UK releases and Brandon narrating the US releases. Most episodes in this series have two titles: the titles from the UK broadcasts are shown on top, while the American-adapted titles are shown underneath. This was also the last season of the use of the live-action model animation to the show before switching over to full CGI in 2009, starting with Hero of the Rails. Production =Filming and animation= Series 12 marked the beginning of the show's transition into CGI (computer-generated imagery)., Licensing.biz, \\"Hit reveals new look for Bob and Thomas\\", Worldscreen, \\"Thomas, Bob Take CGI Route\\" Characters' faces were animated through CGI with the aid of motion capture animation. The physical models' molded faces were replaced by white targets with triangles to fix a computer-animated face in post-production. Static models of people and animals were replaced with 3D animations by using small, metal sticks with coloured points on each end. The animation was provided by Nitrogen Studios, the studio contracted for future full-CGI episodes. This change marked the movement of production of the show from the United Kingdom to Canada,, Nitrogen Studios website although the model scenes were still filmed at Shepperton Studios. This was the last series where Ed Welch provided the music, while Robert Hartshorne continues to compose the music afterwards until he was took over by Chris Renshaw in Thomas & Friends in 4-D: Bubbling Boilers. HiT Entertainment's Senior Vice-President of Production and Programming, Christopher Skala, stated that the change, aside from budgetary reasons, was intended to convey more emotion and flexibility through the stories. Skala claimed that, of his focus group, even those who felt that Thomas, as an institution, should not be changed in this way ultimately responded positively to the demonstration of the new animation techniques. Closed captioning for the 30-minute version of the show was produced by CaptionMax.

It was founded in 1972 as UBAF Limited, adopted its current name in 1996, and registered as a public limited company in 2009. The bank provides international trade solutions to clients trading in and out of developing markets in the Middle East and Africa. BACB has a head office in London, and four representative offices in Algiers in Algeria, Tripoli in Libya, Dubai in the UAE and Abidjan in the Cote D'Ivoire. The bank has 17 sister banks across Europe, Asia and Africa. It is owned by three main shareholders - the Libyan Foreign Bank (87.80%), Banque Centrale Populaire (6.10%) and Banque Extérieure d'Algérie (6.10%).BACB Shareholders BACB Shareholders The bank provides services of trade finance, commodity finance, lending and structured finance, treasury, real estate lending, banking and payment services, and asset distribution and syndication. The current Chairman is Michael Stevenson, and the current Chief Executive Officer is Susie Aliker History =Origins= The bank was founded in 1972 as UBAF Limited and changed its name to UBAF Bank Limited in 1977. It began as an affiliate of Midland Bank, and became an affiliate of HSBC when HSBC took over Midland Bank in 1992. The bank adopted the name British Arab Commercial Bank in 1996. =Since 2009= In 2009, Commercial Bank of Egypt sold its 8% stake. At the time, the other shareholders were HSBC (49%), Libyan Foreign Bank (26%), Bank Al-Maghrib (8%), and Banque Extérieure d’Algérie (8%). Banque Centrale Populaire eventually bought out Bank Al-Maghrib and thus gained a stake in BACB. In 2010, HSBC sold its 49% shareholding to the Libyan Foreign Bank (\\"LFB\\"), a subsidiary of the Central Bank of Libya (\\"CBL\\"). Its share is 87.80%, with the other shareholders being Banque Centrale Populaire (6.10%), and Banque Extérieure d’Algérie (6.10%). On 2 June 2009, the Bank changed its corporate status from that of a private to a public company. In 2016, the bank opened new representative offices in Dubai, and Abidjan, to add to its existing representative offices in Algiers, and in Tripoli. Operating area =Africa= BACB aims to facilitate cross-border trade through a sustainable revenue base with its chosen clients and markets. The bank is known for dealing with markets with which larger banks are often hesitant to do business, such as Middle Eastern and North African markets. The bank serves the rest of the African continent through relationships with a number of financial institutions and correspondent banks, particularly in Nigeria and Ghana. Most notably, the bank works with Saf Cacao in Cote D'Ivoire, and Casablanca-based steel company Acier Longofer in Morocco, becoming the first commercial bank to fund the latter. =Europe= While the majority of the bank's clients are African and Middle Eastern companies and institutions, working with them brings it into regular contact with European exporters and importers. The bank also has sister banks in European countries, including Spain, Italy and France. =Middle East= The representative office in Dubai acts as a gateway for the bank to reach out to the surrounding area, and into parts of Asia and Europe. Financial performance After a shaky performance over the preceding few years, BACB regained a stable position in 2016, and made a profit of £2.6 million before tax deductions. The bank's total assets also came to £2.9 billion that same year. The successful financial year also included an 11% increase in operating income to £42.7 million.

It was a side-by-side, two-seat, high-wing taildragger. Development The Rearwin company had specialized in aircraft powered by small radial engines, such as their Sportster and Cloudster, and had even purchased the assets of LeBlond Engines to make small radial engines in-house in 1937. By 1940, however, it was clear Rearwin would need a design powered by a small horizontally opposed engine to remain competitive. Intended for sport pilots and flying businessmen, the \\"Rearwin Model 165\\" first flew on April 9th, 1940. Originally named the \\"Ranger,\\" Ranger Engines (who also sold several engines named \\"Ranger\\") protested, and Rearwin renamed the design \\"Skyranger.\\" The overall design and construction methods allowed Rearwin to take orders for Skyrangers then deliver the aircraft within 10 weeks. The Skyranger's development in 1940 came shortly before the U.S. entered World War II. At that time, the U.S. government was purchasing almost any airplane in the two-seat, 50-90 horsepower class as training aircraft for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (\\"CPT Program\\" or \\"CPTP\\"), intended to develop tens of thousands of pilots for the possibility of U.S. involvement in the war. However, unlike its contemporaries heavily used in the CPTP such as the Piper Cub, Taylorcraft, Interstate Cadet, and Porterfield Collegiate, the Skyranger was rejected by the government for CPTP use as too challenging to fly. By 1942, Rearwin had produced only 82 Skyrangers (compared to hundreds or thousands of its competitors' planes) when World War II forced production to halt. In 1945 Commonwealth Aircraft re- established production of the Skyranger. The first 12 had to be hand-built, as the original jigs and tooling were recycled or scrapped during World War II. In 1946, production shifted to Valley Stream, New York. the Commonwealth Skyranger had minor modifications but was essentially the same as the pre-war aircraft. Commonwealth went bankrupt in 1946, and was dissolved in March of 1947, partly because the pre-war design failed to compete with new designs and cheap war surplus aircraft. Design The Skyranger was a high-wing light plane seating two people side-by-side. It had a conventional landing gear with a tailwheel. It was constructed with a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage and wooden wing (with a semi-symmetical airfoil cross-section. The Skyranger was powered by a variety of opposed engines made by Continental Motors and the Franklin Engine Company,Davisson, Budd, \\"Sometimes 'Free' Would Still Be Too Much: Bringing a Rearwin Skyranger back from the dead,\\" July, 2003, EAA Vintage Airplane, Vol.31, No.07, retrieved October 10, 2017 ranging from 65 to 90 horsepower. It sold for $1,795 to $2,400., The Skyranger handled differently from the other planes in its class (such as the Cub, Taylorcraft, Cadet, Collegiate, and Aeronca Chief) -- with a \\"heavy-airplane feel\\" (heavy controls, exceptional stability). With an unusually large vertical stabilizer for its size, the Skyranger was exceptionally susceptible to crosswinds during landing and taxiing. Unusually for the time and aircraft in its class, the Skyranger was also designed with slots in its outer wings to allow controllability at lower speeds. Variants ;Rearwin Model 165 :Prototype of the Skyranger family and first made public as the \\"Ranger,\\" it featured a 65hp Continental A65 engine. The 65hp engine was later offered as a lower-cost option. At least 1 built. ;Rearwin Skyranger 175 :Initial production version, the model number was increased to reflect the use of a 75hp Continental A65 engine as standard. ;Rearwin Skyranger 180 :Up-engined version of the Skyranger 175 using the 80hp Continental A65 engine. ;Rearwin Skyranger 180F :Up-engined version of the Skyranger 175 using the 80hp Franklin Engines' 4AC-176-F3. The engine change required a new cowling, but introduced an automotive-type starter and generator. New options increased the gross weight of the plane by 100lbs, so the fuselage tubing was strengthened. ;Rearwin Skyranger 190F :A further up-engined version of the Skyranger 180F using the 90hp Franklin Engines' 4AC-199-E3. 1 built. ;Commonwealth Skyranger 175 :The Rearwin Skyranger 175 with minor modifications. ;Commonwealth Skyranger 185 :Commonwealth Skyranger 175 with an 85hp Continental engine. This was the standard version produced by Commonwealth Aircraft Company. Rearwin also offered a low-cost version of the Skyranger from 1940 to 1941.

Robert Mitchum stars as Arch Hall Sr., a lazy, scheming American in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, an aviation school for pilots too old to fly aircraft but not too old to fly military gliders and liaison aircraft.Takara, Paul. \\"Articles: 'The Last Time I Saw Archie' (1961).\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: May 2, 2015. Jack Webb produced, directed and costarred. The film is currently unavailable on DVD. There is an Internet petition to support a home video release. The campaign was initiated by the Jack Webb Fan Club Los Angeles Chapter. Plot In flying school, lazy Private Archie Hall (Robert Mitchum) somehow dominates everyone around him, fellow trainees, sergeants and officers alike, and manages to avoid doing any work. Bill Bowers (Jack Webb), a Hollywood screenwriter in civilian life, becomes his sidekick. An initially hostile, suspicious trio of privates, Sam Beacham (Louis Nye), Russell Drexler (Joe Flynn) and Frank Ostrow (Del Moore), are penalized for opposing him and eventually smarten up and become his pals as well. Archie exudes so much self-confidence that Master Sergeant Stanley Erlenheim (Robert Strauss) becomes convinced that he is an undercover G-2 (counterintelligence) general. Erlenheim and his underling, Sergeant Malcolm Greenbriar (Harvey Lembeck), arrange it so that Archie and his buddies are given permanent passes and a personal jeep, so they can leave the training base whenever they please. Archie sees Cindy Hamilton (France Nuyen) every night, while Bill pairs off with Peggy Kramer (Martha Hyer). Archie also arranges for the three other privates to acquire gorgeous girlfriends as well. As time goes by, Bill comes to suspect that Cindy is a Japanese spy, but he cannot get Archie to take it seriously (even though Cindy keeps giving him money in outsized old bills). It turns out that Cindy actually is a spy, but for American counterintelligence, despite the opposition of her guardian, Colonel Edwin Martin, the base commander. Sergeants Erlenheim and Greenbriar get into trouble when they break down the door of her apartment, thinking they will catch her in the act of reporting to the enemy, only to find her presenting her findings to Martin. As the war winds down, requirements change and the trainees are given the choice of retraining to become either aerial gunners or glider pilots. Archie and Bill opt for the latter, despite the supposedly high casualty rate, so the other three do the same, only to discover that Archie and Bill have gotten themselves safe jobs at the base. However, the war ends before any of them see combat. Archie invites himself to spend a week with Bill in Hollywood. Bill is shown hard at work in his tiny office at a film studio; Archie has somehow become his boss, and has just been promoted to head of the studio. Bill jokes about seeing him in the White House. A later newspaper headline states that Governor Hall has decided to run for president.

The main character in The Last Time I Saw Archie, played by Robert Mitchum was based on Arch Hall Sr., whom screenwriter William Bowers knew in the war.Weaver 2014, p. 3. However, the film was made without the permission of Hall, who successfully sued the producers and won a settlement.Weaver 2003, p. 193. The film also features the debuts of baseball pitcher Don Drysdale and football quarterback Billy Kilmer in cameos. Portions of the film were shot at Fort MacArthur. Reception The film review in The New York Times summarized The Last Time I Saw Archie as part of the \\"too many cooks syndrome\\", \\"... especially military chefs—spoiling the broth appears to be painfully true of 'The Last Time I Saw Archie'.\\"\\"Movie review: 'Last Time I Saw Archie' at the Victoria.\\" The New York Times, May 29, 1961. The Los Angeles Times review said, \\"The most irritating fact is that it could have been a really hilarious picture, but every time the action shows promise of better things to come, it bogs down in the same old static situations and these receive no help from William Brower's script or Jack Webb's direction.\\" Novelization In an unusual (if not entirely singular) approach to tie-in fiction, Jack Webb's production company decided to create the impression that the film was based on a pre-existing book. They commissioned a young Robert Carlisle (who would later distinguish himself as a war historian) to novelize the Bowers script, which he did, under his by-line, delivering it as the first-person memoir of a character named Burns instead of Bowers (first name still Bill). The adaptation was published as Archie (suggesting that this was the screenplay's original title) by Pocket Books in the guise of a non tie-in, standalone novel, in February 1960, 15 months prior to release of the film, likely prior to the start of production as well. (The only \\"tell\\" indicating the book's progeny is on the copyright page: In tiny print, the rights holder is Jack Webb's company, Mark VII Productions.) Novelizations of the era were commonly released weeks, even months, prior to a film's release, in the hopes that a strong selling book might drum up interest and even critic-proof the movie; but to have one designed to let the reader infer that it was the basis for the film that it was itself based on…well, it was a strategy worth of Arch Hall himself. The novelization's subsequent tie-in edition, published under the revised title, The Last Time I Saw Archie—its cover featuring Nuyen, Mitchum, Webb and Hyer with arms linked, walking forward—didn't spill the beans either. Indeed, in small print, the cover gets to legitimately claim, \\"(Original title: ARCHIE)\\", extending the illusion that the book came before the uncredited screenplay.

A follower of the Ger Hasidic dynasty, he heads Agudat Yisrael, part of the United Torah Judaism alliance, in the Knesset, and served as Minister of Housing and Construction between May 2020 and September 2020. He previously served as Minister of Health. Biography Litzman was born on 2 September 1948 to Polish survivors of the Holocaust, in a displaced persons camp in Germany. When he was two years old, the family immigrated to the East New York section of Brooklyn, and then to the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, where he grew up. In 1966, at age 17, he immigrated to Israel, and continued his Torah studies. Litzman is married, has five children, and lives in Jerusalem. He is quoted as saying that, \\"in some respects, I envy the low profile the Haredi community in the United States has been able to retain by staying out of politics\\". He also said that, in Israel, the media attention makes for misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the Haredi community. Career Litzman in 2010 His first job was as principal of the Hasidic Beis Yaakov girls' school in Jerusalem. He became active in politics under the guidance of the then-Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Simcha Binem Alter. Over time, Litzman became known as the rebbe's right-hand man, a role he continues under the present Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Yaakov Arye Alter. In 1999, the present rebbe asked Litzman to join the Agudat Yisrael faction of the United Torah Judaism list for the Knesset elections that year. He was subsequently elected, and became Chairman of the Finance Committee. He headed the UTJ list for the 2003 elections,UTJ list Israel Democracy Institute and was re-elected, again becoming the Chair of the Finance Committee. He has since served as the leader of the UTJ and Agudat Yisrael faction in the Knesset, in which he consults the Gerrer Rebbe on a daily basis. Litzman was re-elected again in 2006, retaining his chairmanship of the Finance Committee, and for a fourth time in 2009, after which UTJ joined the new government, in which Litzman was appointed Deputy Minister of Health, despite having no medical training or expertise. After Litzman was re-elected in 2013, UTJ were excluded from the coalition government. However, following the 2015 elections, he was re-appointed Deputy Minister of Health. Subsequently, Litzman appointed the first non-physician to serve as general-director of the Ministry of Health, in a move that was criticized by the Israel Medical Association. Litzman was appointed on 27 August 2015, Minister of Health, after a court challenge filed by Yesh Atid. Litzman served on the Knesset's Internal Affairs Committee from 1999 to 2001,News 2001 and as the Deputy Chairman of the Knesset Labor and Welfare Committee.News 2000 As part of the coalition agreement with the ruling government of Ariel Sharon in 2001, Litzman was appointed chairman of the Knesset Finance Committee, a position he held until 2003, and again from 2005 to 2007. He formally resigned as health minister on 26 November 2017, in protest of railroad repair work happening on the Sabbath, becoming deputy health minister instead, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominally held the office, with Litzman acting as de facto minister. When Netanyahu was forced to resign the health office, among others, due to the pending prosecution of three criminal cases against him, on 29 December 2019, despite a recommendation by Israeli police to criminally prosecute Litzman in two separate cases, he was again appointed health minister. The move prompted backlash, including an open letter to Netanyahu from Zionist Federation of Australia president Jeremy Leibler calling the promotion of Litzman \\"a slap in the face to the Australian Jewish Community, the Australian people, the community of Australian [immigrants] in Israel, and, most shockingly, to the survivors of Malka Leifer's alleged abuse\\". = Coronavirus pandemic = Litzman has served as minister of health from the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and has been criticized for an \\"unprofessional handling\\" of the crisis. Due to his exceptionally lenient attitude toward enforcing health guidelines in ultra-Orthodox communities from the start of the crisis, major outbreaks appeared in ultra-Orthodox communities throughout Israel. In an interview in March 2020, Litzman stated: \\"I am sure that the messiah will come by Passover and save us the same way God saved us during the exodus, and we were freed. The messiah will come and save us all.\\" Later in March, an open letter was penned to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White leader Benny Gantz by many heads of hospital departments and senior doctors, as well as medical officials, lamenting years of neglect that left the country's health care system at its lowest point during the time of coronavirus outbreak, and urged that Litzman be replaced as a result. On 2 April 2020, Litzman and his wife tested positive for COVID-19, while acting as Minister of Health. He was the first member of the cabinet to be infected. As a result, he self-quarantined, and began working from home. Israel's Shin Bet reviewed Litzman's phone after his COVID-19 diagnosis to track his movements, and the Health Ministry maintained that anyone who came into contact with him has been contacted personally. Top ministers in Israel's government were furious at Litzman for flouting social distancing guidelines after he and his wife tested positive for the coronavirus, with senior officials accusing Litzman of putting his colleagues' lives in danger, while knowingly breaking his own ministry's safety rules regarding the virus. Litzman was spotted praying at the home of a fellow member of his Hasidic sect three days after government guidelines went into effect barring such services. Additionally, after the guidelines had further intensified, Litzman was again spotted praying at a synagogue just outside his home. With the Thirty-fifth government of Israel, Litzman resigned from the Knesset as part of the Norwegian Law, and was sworn in as Minister of Housing and Construction. On September 13, 2020, Litzman resigned as Minister of Housing and Construction in protest over a nationwide coronavirus shutdown scheduled to begin over the High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot, beginning on the first night on Rosh Hashanah, September 19, for at least three weeks. Other acts =Statement on LGBT rights= During a February 2016 discussion in the Knesset about Israeli health authorities becoming more sensitive towards LGBT people, Litzman compared LGBT people to the sinners who danced around the Golden Calf. =Smoking regulation= Litzman has been criticized over policies and statements that seemed to serve the interests of the tobacco companies, including hindering some efforts to curb cigarette ads. For example, in his first tenure as deputy health minister (2009-2013), Litzman opposed warning labels and stickers that depict the effects of smoking, despite their role in reducing the habit in other countries. Litzman argued that the images of dirty lungs and teeth aimed at discouraging children and youth from smoking were \\"unaesthetic\\", stating, \\"With the help of G-d, we won't approve this... We don't need to disfigure the State with such images.\\" In his second tenure (starting 2015), Litzman was criticized for opposing legislation prohibiting tobacco advertising in newspapers. Litzman argued that such laws would bankrupt newspapers, which rely on the advertising revenue. It was pointed out that Litzman had a conflict of interest due to his close association with ultra-Orthodox publications (Hamodia in particular) that rely on revenue from the many tobacco ads that they publish. Specifically, Litzman had a particularly strong conflict of interest concerning Hamodia, due to the fact that it is published by his Agudat Yisrael party (part of UTJ), and employs his wife. A bill restricting the marketing of tobacco was finally agreed upon after other MKs threatened to vote against a bill restricting retail operations on Shabbat and Jewish religious holidays. However, Litzman stipulated that he would only agree to the legislation on the (unusual) condition that the ban would not include printed publications (ultra-Orthodox Jews tend to abhor the Internet, making printed publications their primary form of media, hence Litzman's primary concern). = Malka Leifer = Litzman is accused of obstructing the extradition of Malka Leifer, the accused in the Adass Israel School sex abuse scandal. According to Israeli media, he attempted to obtain false psychiatric evaluations that would deem Leifer unfit to face trial in Australia. Israeli police recommended on 6 August 2019 that Litzman be indicted for \\"fraud and breach of trust\\" (both related to the Leifer case), as well as bribery in another case. = United Hatzalah = Eli Beer, the president of Israel's United Hatzalah ambulance service, while hospitalized in serious condition in Miami after contracting the coronavirus, lambasted Litzman from his hospital bed for sidelining his medics by refusing to allow Hatzalah's 6,000 volunteers to play any role in assisting the Health Ministry and Magen David Adom with conducting virus tests. Litzman argued that Hatzalah staff were less professional. \\"He is a spiteful, evil person\\", Beer claimed. \\"I really hope he isn't health minister in the next government. The man has been fighting United Hatzalah for several years. A bad man without a good heart, who only looks out for his own interests.\\" References External links Minister Litzman Wins Poll As Most Liked Minister * Poll ranks Health Minister Litzman higher than Netanyahu - Israel News - Jerusalem Post * “LGBT People Know That They’re Sinners” - AWiderBridge 1948 births Living people Agudat Yisrael politicians Ger (Hasidic dynasty) Government ministers of Israel Haredi rabbis in Israel Polish Jews Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent United Torah Judaism leaders Members of the 15th Knesset (1999–2003) Members of the 16th Knesset (2003–2006) Members of the 17th Knesset (2006–2009) Members of the 18th Knesset (2009–2013) Members of the 19th Knesset (2013–2015) Members of the 20th Knesset (2015–2019) Members of the 21st Knesset (2019) Members of the 22nd Knesset (2019–2020) Ministers of Health of Israel People from East New York, Brooklyn People from Borough Park, Brooklyn Members of the 23rd Knesset (2020–) American emigrants to Israel ","title":"Yaakov Litzman"},{"id":"13194752","text":"Munbaeju is a Korean traditional distilled liquor produced in South Korea and is considered to be one of the finest Korean spirits.

They are commonly referred to as tinsel lilies, and are endemic to southern Australia. Description Plants in the genus Calectasia are small, branched shrubs to about 50 cm high with stiff, erect branchlets covered by old leaves and leaf sheaths. The branchlets are covered with short, soft hairs and the lance-shaped leaves have pointed ends and parallel veins. Flowers occur singly on the ends of short branchlets above a large number of small, overlapping leaves. They have six lilac-blue to purple petals (strictly tepals) which form a short tube at their lower end but mostly spreading, forming a star-like pattern with a metallic sheen. Six bright yellow or orange stamens form a tube in the centre of the flower with a thin style extending beyond the centre of the tube. Some species of Calectasia form specialised roots called stilt roots and can only regenerate from seed whilst others have tubers and can resprout from these. All stilt-rooted species are thought to be killed by fire and need up to five years without fire to flower and set seed. Taxonomy and naming The first species to be named was Calectasia cyanea by Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen (page 263). The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words kalos \\" beautiful\\" and ektasis \\"development\\", alluding to the blue spreading perianth-tubes. Earlier authors such as George Bentham recognised only one species (C. cyanea) but later botanists added C. grandiflora and C. intermedia. In 2001, Barrett and Dixon reviewed the genus and added eight new species and in 2015 four more species were added making a total of 15. Distribution and habitat Calectasia species occur in the south-west of Western Australia and in the border areas between South Australia and Victoria. C. intermedia is only found in the latter region and the remaining species only in Western Australia. They occupy a variety of habitats, occasionally in seasonally swampy areas, but more usually in low heath or woodland on sand, or over laterite or granite. Ecology There is evidence that all Calectasia species have sand-binding roots and flowers that are buzz pollinated. It is possible that the similarity in appearance of Calectasia and Thelymitra variegata flowers indicate an example of Dodsonian mimicry. Calectasia grandiflora and Thelymitra variegata often occur in the same area. Individual Calectasia plants are often parasitised by a dodder-like plant in the genus Cassytha.

(full title: Gung Ho!: The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders) is a 1943 American war film directed by Ray Enright and starring Randolph Scott. The story is based somewhat on the real-life World War II Makin Island raid led by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson's 2nd Marine Raider Battalion. Plot The film begins with a tough Greek lieutenant (J. Carrol Naish) announcing that the United States Marine Corps is seeking volunteers for a hazardous mission and special unit. Sgt. \\"Transport\\" Anderof (Sam Levene) meets the commander of the unit, Lt. Col. Thorwald (Randolph Scott), with whom he has served while stationed in China. Thorwald explains that he left the Corps to serve with the Chinese Red Army fighting the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War to learn their methods and has decided to form a unit using the qualities of Gung Ho or \\"work together\\". Among the volunteers for the unit are a hillbilly (Rod Cameron), who responds to a gunnery sergeant's (Walter Sande) question whether he can kill someone with the fact that he already has. Alan Curtis is an ordained minister keeping his vocation a secret. Robert Mitchum is \\"Pig Iron\\"; a boxer from a background of poverty and hard work. Harold Landon is a young and small street kid who is initially rejected by Naish but wins him over, as both worked as dishwashers on ships bound to the United States from Piraeus, Greece. Noah Beery Jr. and David Bruce are rivals for a United States Navy nurse (Grace McDonald). Volunteers with brief screen time include a Filipino wishing to avenge his sister (who was left behind in Manila and may have been raped or killed by the Japanese) who teaches the Raiders knife fighting, an embittered marine who had a brother killed at Pearl Harbor, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War who sees the war as a continuation of the fight against fascism, and a Marine who honestly admits, \\"I just don't like Japs\\". The film moves rapidly in a documentary style, with stock footage of training narrated by Chet Huntley. Those who make it through the training are sent to Hawaii for further jungle warfare training, where they witness the damage of the attack on Pearl Harbor. In Hawaii they hear a radio bulletin of the announcement of the Battle of Guadalcanal. The Marines are ordered to board two submarines, the and the , destined for a commando raid on a Japanese-held island. After a claustrophobic voyage, the Raiders invade the island from rubber boats. The Marine landing is met by fire from snipers hiding in palm trees. The Marines dispose of them, attack the Japanese headquarters, wipe out the garrison, destroy installations with explosives, then board the submarines for their return home.

The Japanese were played by Chinese and Filipino extras.'Gung Ho!': The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders (1943) - Trivia Themes The fast-moving film is a template for many war films and other adventure or western films where a group of professional killers and misfits in polite society are handpicked by an inspiring leader, trained to perfection, then use their initiative and skills in marksmanship, combat and knife fighting on an enemy who greatly outnumber them. Thorwald/Carlson lectures throughout the film that the Japanese have no initiative and cannot think for themselves or deviate from a plan; thus unexpected action pays off. This is demonstrated in several scenes where a Marine defeats his opponent in unarmed combat by spitting tobacco in his eyes, a small but fast runner strips down to his trousers and quickly zig-zags through enemy fire to hurl hand grenades at a machine-gun nest, Marines destroy a Japanese pillbox and its occupants by squashing both with a road construction steamroller, and a speechless Robert Mitchum who has been shot in the throat and is unable to give warning, kills a Japanese infiltrator attempting to kill the battalion surgeon (Milburn Stone) by throwing his knife in the Japanese soldier's back. The climax of the film has the Raiders painting a giant American flag on the roof of a building, then luring the counterattacking Japanese to the area where their own air force bombs and strafes them. In contrast to the Japanese and the rest of the American military, Thorwald orders that his officers wear no rank insignia and have no special privileges. He tells his Raiders, \\"I will eat what you eat and sleep where you sleep\\" and participate in the same training. Thorwald's Marines participate in \\"Gung Ho Sessions\\" where they discuss the unit's plans and each man participates without regard to rank. Reception Bosley Crowther in a January 1944 review for The New York Times praised the film, its performances and settings but said \\"the stabbings and stickings go on Gung Ho! is for folks with strong stomachs and a taste for the submachine gun\\".https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F07EFDD153DE13BBC4E51DFB766838F659EDE =Box Office= The movie was a big hit and earned profits of $577,460. It recorded admissions in France of 748,212 when released there in 1945.Box office information for France in 1945 at Box Office Story =Re-issue= The film was re-released in the early 1950s by Realart Pictures who gave Robert Mitchum second billing on the posters.

Most of its clubs have steam and sauna rooms and there is an outdoor swimming pool at Megabox Club Kowloon Bay, one of its Hong Kong clubs. Controversies = Credit control policies = The company took legal action against 522 of its members between 30 March and 15 September 1999 for non-payment of subscriptions. Many of these were in fact members who did not want to renew and had allowed their membership to lapse, or who had not given the required 1-month's notice stipulated in the contract. The judge at the Small Claims Court criticised the company for allowing the credit to roll on for at least one month before taking action. The company argued that its policy was to avoid unilateral termination by them as it would cause members to pay a rejoining fee. =Monitor complaints in Singapore= California Fitness clubs in Singapore were hit by a significant number of consumer complaints filed against them with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE) between 2011 and 2014.

In Thailand this allowed it fund a domestic expansion from 2 to over 13 locations as well as then expanded to many countries, including Korea, outside Thailand as franchise locations. The franchises didn't last more than 2 years in Korea, these franchisees abruptly closed doors on members in Korea by 2006, who had been sold expensive lifetime memberships. The cross- membership agreements between California Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness were rolled into California WOW Xperience, however once financials became worrisome in August 2008, cross-memberships were terminated between CalWow and 24 Hour Fitness (USA), but remained between Asian chains CalWow and CalFit and between CalFit and 24 Hour Fitness. In August 2008, California Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness were terminated. In 2009, Malaysian branches of CalFit were sold to Celebrity Fitness, whose founders also had ties to 24 Hour Fitness. Despite company changes, California WOW Xperience is still frequently confused with California Fitness.

At roughly the same time, CalFit Taiwan gyms abruptly closed on customers, some who had been sold lifetime memberships, and these became World Gym centers. Membership was honored at the new gym over for a few months and then terminated. In 2016, CalFit itself abruptly closed doors on members in Hong Kong and Singapore, some who had been sold lifetime memberships. =Watchdog complaints in Hong Kong= In April 2016, Consumer Council censured California Fitness for intimidation and misleading sales practices. The council said complaints regarding California Fitness had increased continuously in the previous few years, from 227 cases in 2013 to 296 cases in 2015, despite the council having already given several warnings. In 2015, California Fitness represented more than half of the complaints regarding fitness centres, and the value involved reached to 8.5 million Hong Kong dollars. The council had met with company management in January, and made its censure public after the situation failed to improve. In most of the cases, The sales use \\"free trial\\" or \\"free gift\\" as excused to attract new customers to enter their centre and collect identity card and credit card from the customers, then convince, mislead and force them to sign the contracts and pay for membership, as well as training courses. Some of the sales even force the customers to take a picture with smiling face to prove the contracts are based on their own willing. Some of the cases involve persons with intellectual disability. Two members of staff were arrested by customs officers on 18 May after a customer claimed she had been coerced into paying for private training classes after her credit card was charged HK$140,000 without her consent. The two staff at the Causeway Bay branch of the gym operator chain were accused of violating the unfair trade practice provision under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.  Financial difficulties  JV Fitness, the company that operates the chain, were reported in July 2016 to be owing some HK$130 million for rents and other operating costs in Hong Kong. A number of landlords and building contractors had filed writs with the High Court for debts owed to them. A petition to wind up the company was lodged with the court in early July 2016, and creditors including prepaid members and staff have been coming forward. Five of its outlets had shut as of 7 July; one branch in Beijing was closed from 8 July for \\"internal reorganisation\\". All outlets owned and operated by JV Fitness, the holding company, were officially closed on 12 July, and two senior executives were being interrogated by the Customs and Excise on suspicion of violating trade description law.http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health- environment/article/1988629/branches-struggling-california-fitness-shut-down On 20 July it was announced that all its gyms in Singapore would also close.

Jan Sladký Kozina was first named Rosocha, after Rosoch Farm (U Rosochů), which from 1632 had belonged to his grandfather, and on which he was born and grew up. In 1670 his father Jan Sladky bought the farm \\"At Kozinas\\" (U Kozinů). All those originating from this farm were thereafter called Sladky-Kozina. On 9 May 1678, aged 25, he married Dorota Pelnářová, took over the ancestral farm U Kozinů, and took his place in the middle yeomanry. They seem to have gone on to live as a quiet, godfearing couple. They had 6 sons but only one - Adam - had descendants. He could neither read nor write, but made his name by his speeches, in which he drew attention to the mistreatments of the time, and became the spokesman for farmers' woes. He defended the rights of the Chodové people and demanded justice for the country people. This culminated in disagreement with the local magnate Wolf Maximilian Laminger von Albenreuth, also known as \\"Lomikar\\". Kozina was judged responsible for the peasant rebellion, arrested and executed in Pilsen on the 28th November 1695. He was immortalised as a figure of resistance in the stories of Alois Jirásek and Božena Němcová. In Újezd u Domažlic a memorial to him was set up; his place of execution is marked by a plaque just inside what is now the main entrance to the Pilsner Urquell brewery in Pilsen. Alois Jirásek wrote the book Psohlavci (The Dogheads), which was about the Chodové peoples and young Jan's struggles; this was later turned into an opera of the same name by Karel Kovařovic. In 1918, the newly formed 10th Infantry Shooting Regiment of the newly formed 3rd Division of the Czechoslovak Legions in Russia was named \\"Regiment Jan Sladký Kozina's of Hrádek\\".

Today, the Chodové live in an arc of villages near the western border of Czechia, including major population centers in Domažlice, Tachov and Přimda (together called the Chod region, , ). History Bohemian Shepherd During the medieval period, the monarchy of the Kingdom of Bohemia recruited the ancestors of the Chodové from ethnic enclaves within the western Carpathian Mountain region near the borders of what is today Slovakia, Poland, and southwestern Ukraine (possibly including Silesia), relocating these communities to serve as guards along the borders between Bohemia and Bavaria from possible Germanic expansion into Bohemia. These relocations occurred even as the Bohemian monarchy invited selective immigration of Bavarian craftspeople into certain settlements of western Bohemia to assist in the economic and technological development within their Kingdom. As a condition of their relocation, the ancestral Chodové were made direct servants of the king, with significant privileges that differentiated them from other subjects - including the right of unrestricted movement within the Bohemian Forest region, access to the resources of the forest, and the right to own large dogs forbidden to ordinary Bohemian peasantry. In 1325, the King of Bohemia, John of Luxembourg, acknowledged the rights of the Chodové people to use the woods of western Bohemia, provided that they also protected the borders along them. The Chodové bred special dogs to help accomplish this goal - especially the Bohemian Shepherd (or Chodský pes) which some sources suggest is ancestral to the modern German Shepherd. Chodové traveled widely throughout the mountains of western Bohemia as part of their unique charge and rare freedom, often using special walking staffs, boots, and wide-brimmed hats especially suited to long-distance travel in the mountain forests. Reflected in their ethnonym, implying \\"walkers,\\" \\"rangers\\" or \\"patrollers,\\" they represent a rare example of a professional identity coming to define a group's overall ethnic designation. For over three and a half centuries, the terms of the Chodové agreement with the Bohemian monarchy held until the late 17th century when a local aristocrat of German origin, W. M. Laminger von Albenreuth, declared the agreement void - seeking to contain and undermine the autonomy of Chodové and other Czech peasants. The Chodové revolted in 1695, but were unsuccessful. Many persisted as independent ethnic enclaves in the mountains of western Bohemia, while others were fully or partially assimilated into Czech-speaking or occasionally German-speaking communities of Czech and/or German ethnicity in the adjacent countryside. As Czech nationalism arose through the 19th century, Chodové cultural became emblematic of Slavic resistance to German cultural influence in Czech popular culture - shaping perceptions of Chodové people both within and beyond western Bohemia, and reasserting their identity in opposition to ethnically German Bohemians in spite of a long and complex history linking the two groups. Chodové Since the 20th Century The events of World War II, including the brutal occupation of the Chod region as part of Nazi Germany's Sudetenland annexation, followed by the disorderly and brutal expulsion by the Czechs of German-speakers from western Bohemia at the war's end, contributed to a significant decline in the scale and distribution of the Chodové population within western Bohemia. Still, up to 11 villages of Chodové persist, and many still live in the countryside near towns such as Domažlice. They speak the Chod dialect, a separate dialect of Czech, enjoy unique and strong traditions such as the use of special folk costume and musical instruments; they maintain a strong sense of identity that is linked to the Bohemian Forest and their role as defenders of the western Bohemian borderland. Chodové in Art and Literature The Chodové have been the focus of art and literature, much of it tied to Czech romanticist and nationalist themes. The Czech painter Jaroslav Špillar lived among them for many years, capturing scenes from their daily life.

Ipswich, Suffolk, 19 February 1556) were two English women of Ipswich who were imprisoned and burned at the stake in Ipswich during the Marian persecutions: both are commemorated among the Ipswich Martyrs. Their arrest followed immediately after the burning of Robert Samuel.  Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield  Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield were two married townswomen of Ipswich of the artisan class, the husband of one being a shoemaker and the other a brewer. Joan's husband Michael Trunchfield, and also John Trunchfield, both of St Leonard's, Ipswich, were at some time under condemnation to be burnt, but it is not recorded that the sentences were carried out. (St Leonard's is not known: this may be a copyist's error for St Laurence.) At the time of the death of Queen Mary I in November 1558 no fewer than seventy-seven people in Ipswich and the neighbourhood lay under condemnation.  They assist Robert Samuel  After the mandate against the married clergy, Robert Samuel, the displaced minister of East Bergholt, sent his wife to live in Ipswich. After Samuel's arrest, Mrs. Potten and Mrs. Trunchfield incurred the penalty of their own arrest and imprisonment by giving him aid and succour in the Ipswich town jail where he was first imprisoned. The Ipswich jailer John Bird had been sympathetic, and it was probably there, when Samuel was in company with other prisoners who belonged to the reformed faith, that Agnes and Joan ministered to him.  Decision to stay, and premonition  After Samuel's arrest, a friend named Rose Nottingham urged the ladies to escape from Ipswich while there was still time to do so. However one of them (it is not known which) replied \\"I know well that it is lawful enough to fly away; which remedy you may use if you list. But my case standeth otherwise. I am tied to a husband, and have besides a sort of young children at home... Therefore I am minded, for the love of Christ and His truth, to stand to the extremity of the matter.\\" While he was in prison in Norwich, and was both tortured and starved, Robert Samuel experienced various visions and dreams. In a certain dream which he related to his friends, he seemed to see \\"three ladders set up toward heaven, of the which there was one somewhat longer than the rest, but at length they became one, joining (as it were) all three together.\\" When he dreamed this, the two ladies were still at liberty.  Arrest and Imprisonment  Robert Samuel was burned at Ipswich on 31 August 1555, and on the following day, 1 September 1555, the women were arrested and imprisoned in the town jail. They remained in prison for five and a half months, during which Agnes Potten was at times \\"cast into marvellous great agonies and troubles of mind,\\" but she remained \\"ardent and zealous\\" in her chosen course.  Execution  The execution was carried out on 19 February 1556, in the presence of a crowd of people at the Cornhill in Ipswich. As they prepared themselves for the stake Joan Trunchfield 'much exceeded the other in joy and comfort.' They urged the bystanders 'to lay hold on the Word of God, and not upon man's devices and inventions.' Then, reciting words from the Scriptures, they were bound to the stake together, and when the fire was lit they held up their hands in the flames while they called upon God for help.

FREPIC-AWAÑAK was formed by merging minority Canarian political organizations such as Organización para los Comunistas Canarios (OCC), and the PRAIC Partido Revolucionario Africano de las Islas Canarias, which had originated in the Partido de los Trabajadores Canarios (PTC), the former political wing of MPAIAC. MPAIAC, Antonio Cubillo's now defunct organization, failed to attract public support among Canarios owing to its violent activity. Political goals The Popular Front of the Canary Islands (FREPIC-AWAÑAK) defines itself as a “popular organization” continuing Antonio Cubillo's support of Berberism. Its aims are to: *Struggle against the “errors” of the autonomist Unión del Pueblo Canario party by “openly refusing any autonomist proposal, even those which claim that they are a preliminary step towards auto-determination and independence.” * Begin a movement for the establishment of the República Popular Canaria, an independent “Popular Republic of the Canary Islands”, by bringing into its fold “the Canarians who are against colonial rule and who favor total political independence from Spain” History The PFCI (FREPIC- AWAÑAK) has never been able to reach effective political representation and has remained a minority group. Its best electoral results were in 1996 in the Spanish Senate elections where it failed to reach enough votes. From that moment the FREPIC-AWAÑAK has not taken part again in any election. Now changed, his independentist principles foremost Moroccan friendship and help cooperation, like a way to demonstrate that golpe de fuerza (strong coup) thinking that is the best way to instigate fear against Central Administration and obtain more autonomy.

It is allied to the genera Guichenotia and Thomasia. The greatest diversity of species is in Western Australia, where 24 species are found of which 8 are endemic to the region. Species occur in lowland sclerophyll forest and heathland habitats. Taxonomy The genus was first defined in 1798 by James Edward Smith, who did not designate a type species. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek word lasios \\"hairy\\", and the Botanical Greek petalon \\"petal\\", and refers to the hairy calyx. Lasiopetalum was previously classified in the family Sterculiaceae, however that family has been sunk into an expanded Malvaceae. Within the family, it gives its name to its tribe Lasiopetaleae, which contains about ten genera, located mostly in Australia. It is closely related to Guichenotia, although the exact relationship and genus delineation is unclear pending further research. Description Most species are spreading or prostrate many-branched shrubs. Commonly known as velvet bushes, they derive their common name from the pubescent (finely-furred) nature of the stems, leaves and flowers. Their leaves are generally arranged alternately on the stems. The flowerheads are either axillary or terminal. The flowers are small, the five-lobed calyces are hairy and the petals tiny. The genus is rarely cultivated, although many species have flushes of attractive reddish hairy new growth, and several were cultivated in England in the 19th century.

They come in a number of different forms, from basic manual devices to complex attachments for power tools. Hand tools =Beam score cutters, cutter boards= First Tile Cutter Invented by Boada Brothers The ceramic tile cutter works by first scratching a straight line across the surface of the tile with a hardened metal wheel and then applying pressure directly below the line and on each side of the line on top. Snapping pressure varies widely, some mass- produced models exerting over 750 kg. The cutting wheel and breaking jig are combined in a carriage that travels along one or two beams to keep the carriage angled correctly and the cut straight. The beam(s) may be height adjustable to handle different thicknesses of tiles. The base of the tool may have adjustable fences for angled cuts and square cuts and fence stops for multiple cuts of exactly the same size. The scoring wheel is easily replaceable.  History  The first tile cutter was designed to facilitate the work and solve the problems that masons had when cutting hydraulic mosaic or encaustic cement tiles (a type of decorative tile with pigmented cement, highly used in 50s, due to the high strength needed because of the high hardness and thickness of these tiles). Over the time the tool evolved, incorporating elements that made it more accurate and productive. The first cutter had an iron point to scratch the tiles. It was later replaced by the current tungsten carbide scratching wheel. Another built-in device introduced in 1960 was the snapping element. It allowed users to snap the tiles easily and not with the bench, the cutter handle or hitting the tile with a knee as it was done before. This was a revolution in the cutting process of the ceramic world. =Tile nippers= Tile nippers are similar to small pairs of pincers, with part of the width of the tool removed so that they can be fit into small holes.

It comprises techniques which take noisy or low- resolution facial images, and convert them into high-resolution images using knowledge about typical facial features. It can be applied in facial recognition systems for identifying faces faster and more effectively. Due to the potential applications in facial recognition systems, face hallucination has become an active area of research. TOC  Differences between face hallucination and super-resolution  Image superresolution is a class of techniques that enhance the resolution of an image using a set of low resolution images. The main difference between both techniques is that face hallucination is the super-resolution for face images and always employs typical face priors with strong cohesion to face domain concept.  Measures  An image is considered high resolution when it measures 128x96 pixels. Therefore, the goal of face hallucination is to make the input image reach that number of pixels. The most common values of the input image is usually 32x24 pixels or 16x12 pixels. Moreover, the challenge in face hallucination is the difficulty of aligning faces. Many methods are required to bring the alignment between the test sample taken and the training samples. Even a slight amount of wrong alignment can degrade the method and the result.  The algorithm  In the last two decades, many specific face hallucination algorithms have been reported to perform this technique. Although the existing face hallucination methods have achieved great success, there is still much room for improvement. The common algorithms usually perform two steps: the first step generates global face image which keeps the characteristics of the face using probabilistic method maximum a posteriori (MAP). The second step produces residual image to compensate the result of the first step. Furthermore, all the algorithms are based on a set of high- and low-resolution training image pairs, which incorporates image super-resolution techniques into facial image synthesis. Any face hallucination algorithm must be based in three constraints: Data constraint The output image should be nearly to the original image when it is smoothed or down-sampled. Global constraint The resulting image always contains all common features of a human face. The facial features must be coherent always. Without this constraint, the output could be too noisy. Local constraint The output image must have very specific features of the face image having resemblance with photorealistic local features. Without this constraint, the resulting image could be too smooth.  Methods  Face hallucination enhances facial features improved image resolution using different methods. The simplest way to increase image resolution is a direct interpolation increasing the pixel intensities of input images with such algorithms as nearest-neighbour, bilinear and variants of cubic spline interpolation. Another approach to interpolation is to learn how to interpolate from a set of high resolution training samples, together with the corresponding low resolution versions of them. (pg 4 baker and kanade) However, the results are very poor since no new information is added in the process. That is why new methods have been proposed in recent years. = Face hallucination based on Bayes theorem = This method was proposed by Baker and Kanade, the pioneering of face hallucination technique. The algorithm is based on Bayesian MAP formulation and use gradient descent to optimize the objective function and it generates the high frequency details from a parent structure with the assistance of training samples. = Super-resolution from multiple views using learnt image models = Capel and Zisserman was the first to propose the local face image SR method. It divided the face image into four key regions: the eyes, nose, mouth and cheek areas. For each area, it learns a separate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) basis and reconstructs the area separately. However, the reconstructed face images in this method have visible artifacts between different regions. = Face Hallucination via Sparse Coding = This method was proposed by J. Yang and H. Tang and it is based in hallucinating of High-Resolution face image by taking Low-Resolution input value. The method exploits the facial features by using a Non-negative Matrix factorization (NMF) approach to learn localized part-based subspace. That subspace is effective for super-resolving the incoming face. For further enhance the detailed facial structure by using a local patch method based on sparse representation. = Face Hallucination by Eigentransformation = Eigenfaces of face images This method was proposed by Wang and Tang Xiaogang Wang and Xiaoou Tang and it uses an eigentransformation. This method sees the solution as a transformation between different styles of image and uses a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the low-resolution face image. By selecting the number of \\"eigenfaces\\", we can extract amount of facial image information of low resolution and remove the noise. In the eigentransformation algorithm, the hallucinated face image is synthesized by the linear combination of high-resolution training images and the combination coefficients come from the low-resolution face images using the principal component analisis method. The algorithm improves the image resolution by inferring some high-frequency face details from the lowfrequency facial information by taking advantage of the correlation between the two parts. Because of the structural similarity among face images, in multiresolution analysis, there exists strong correlation between the high-frequency band and low-frequency band. For high-resolution face images, PCA can compact this correlated information onto a small number of principal components. Then, in the eigentransformation process, these principal components can be inferred from the principal components of the low-resolution face by mapping between the high- and low-resolution training pairs. = Two-step approach = This method was developed by C. Liu and Shum C. Liu, H.Y. Shum and W.T Freeman C. Liu, H.Y. Shum and W.T Freeman and it integrates a global parametric and a local parametric model. The global model is a lineal parametric inference and the local model is a patch-based non-parametric Markov network. In first step, learn the relationship between the high resolution image and their smoothed and down-sampled. In second step, model the residue between an original high resolution and the reconstructed high-resolution image after applying learned lineal model by a non-parametric Markov network to capture the high-frequency content of faces. = Face hallucination based on MCA = This algorithm formulates the face hallucination as an image decomposition problem and propose a Morphological Component Analysis (MCA)) Yan Liang, Xiaohua Xie, Jian-Huang Lai based method. The method is presented in three-step framework. Firstly, a low-resolution input image is up-sampled by an interpolation. The interpolated image can be represented as a superposition of the global high- resolution image and an “unsharp mask”. In the second step, the interpolated image is decomposed into a global high-resolution image by using MCA to obtain the global approximation of the HR image from interpolated image. Finally, facial detail information is compensated onto the estimated HT image by using the neighbour reconstruction of position-patches. = Another methods = * Face hallucination by tensor patch super-resolution and coupled residue compensation. * Superresolution with sparse representation for video surveillance. * Hallucinating face by position patch. * Position-based. * LPH super-resolution and neighbor reconstruction for residue compensation.  Results  All methods presented above have very satisfactory results and meet expectations, so it is difficult to determine which method is most effective and which gives a better result. However, it can be stated that: * The method of Baker and Kanade can distort the characteristic features of a face image. * The result of the method developed by Wang and Tang can create ringing effect.

The model's strategies may also be used by teachers to prevent the development of challenging behaviours in the classroom. The model was developed in Queensland, Australia early this decade by a team of behaviour support teachers led by Patrick Connor, an applied psychologist working as a guidance officer within this team. The teachers, who work within a Behaviour Management Unit work with children who can no longer attend school due to exclusions or suspension from school. The pain model is grounded in the work they have done with these students identified as high- risk; students whose behaviour has resulted in a referral to the Behaviour Management Unit – a service supplied to schools by some states in Australia.  Basis  Connor drew on the work of Eric Berne and Harris Berne 1964, 1966; Harris, 1967)Penfold (1952 who researched the influences of past experiences on later behaviour, and O’Reilly (1994) and accepted the proposition of the neuro-physiological link between the brain and behaviour.Alcock, 2003 Connor recognised, as far as learning was concerned, that there was little difference between the effect of physical pain and psychological pain. Both types of pain were debilitating and inhibited learning. The pain model recognises that social problems such as homelessness, skill-lessness, meaninglessness, domestic violence, abuse, addiction or chemical or organic problems such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) cause psychological pain. When high-risk students (students that are experiencing one or more of these problems) are fearful, stressed and experiencing psychological pain teachers need to calm the student and relieve the pain before participation within the school environment can begin. The model also allows the teacher to understand that the student’s behaviour is due to the pain they are experiencing making a less stressful classroom environment and allowing teachers to be more patient with students.  Assumptions  # If students ‘feel good’ they will ‘act good’; if students ‘feel bad’ they will ‘act bad’. # Behaviour is a type of communication and, because it is a type of communication schools may misinterpret the intended meaning of the message the student is sending through ‘bad’ behaviour. # Students who act ‘bad’ may be unhappy and experiencing pain; inflicting punishment will only make this worse. Listening to students is more appropriate than punishing them. # When young people are abused they cannot build primary relationships and often do not have the skills to participate in the class environment. They need to be taught these skills prior to gradual reintegration to the school. # Traditional models of discipline are not effective with high-risk students. # Some students ‘act bad’ in order to be punished and noticed. As a result, they are noticed for their behaviour not for who they are.  Principles  * Acknowledge the pain * Value the person  Preventative strategies  * Develop relationships * Give clear instructions * Care for teachers – support provided to teachers with ‘high- risk’ students.  Corrective strategies  * Relieve the pain and calm the student – teach relaxation techniques, assess and address physical needs * Re- skill the student – teach personal skills, interpersonal skills, academic skills and problem solving skills * Reconstruct self-esteem – use slogans; set up for success; encourage * Use related strategies - agreements; self-managing log; adjunctive therapies; collaboration with parents * Refer on - deeper therapy.  School-wide strategies  * Make school a welcoming place * Create a welfare centre  Advantages  * Less stress for teachers * Better outcomes for high-risk students * Long-term advantages for teachers and society * Actively involves parents in process  Disadvantages  * Resource intensive * Change to whole school culture needed * It is difficult for some teachers to relinquish power * Some teachers expect naughty students to be punished * Some aspects of the model are not suitable for use as general behaviour management for the majority of classes * Relies upon all aspects of the child’s life supporting the basis of this model in order for it to be successful  References  # Edwards, C.

Plot A poor boy gathering wood with a sleigh wants to warm himself by a fire and finds a small golden key beneath the snow; then he finds a small iron box in the ground. The text ends with the statement that the reader now has to wait until he has unlocked it. Origin Since the second part of the first edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales in 1815, The Golden Key was always in the last place; since the edition before the last one, in 1850, it was in place 200. According to their notes, the Brothers Grimm got it from Hessen (probably from Marie Hassenpflug). They mention a \\"similar fairy tale in the Deutsches Sprachbuch von Adolf Gutbier\\" (German Language Book by Adolf Gutbier), about two chickens who find a little key and a little box in the dung. The box contains a short piece of fur made of red silk, and \\"if it had been longer, the fairy tale would have become longer, too\\". The Fox and the Geese has a similar function for the first part, which was released in 1812. References All references are in German. *Grimm, Brüder. Kinder- und Hausmärchen. Complete Edition.

It is often done by students in preparation for upcoming exams, especially just before they are due. Usually the student's priority is to obtain shallow recall suited to a superficial examination protocol, rather than to internalize the deep structure of the subject matter. Cramming is often discouraged by educators because the hurried coverage of material tends to result in poor long-term retention of material, a phenomenon often referred to as the spacing effect. Despite this, educators nevertheless widely persist in the use of superficial examination protocols, because these questions are easier to compose, quicker (and therefore cheaper for the institution) to grade, and objective on their own terms. When cramming, one attempts to focus only on studies and to forgo unnecessary actions or habits.  Prevalence  Cramming is often done the night before a test, or in the days before a final exam. In Commonwealth countries, cramming usually occurs during the revision week (week before exams), also known as \\"swotvac\\" or \\"stuvac\\".  As a study technique  H.E. Gorst stated in his book, The Curse of Education, \\"as long as education is synonymous with cramming on an organized plan, it will continue to produce mediocrity.\\"Gorst, H.E. The Curse of Education. London: Grant Richards, 1901. (Page 5). Generally considered an undesirable study technique, cramming is becoming more and more common among students both at the secondary and post-secondary level. Pressure to perform well in the classroom and engage in extracurricular activities in addition to other responsibilities often results in the cramming method of studying. Cramming is a widely used study skill performed in preparation for an examination or other performance-based assessment. Most common among high school and college-aged students, cramming is often used as a means of memorizing large amounts of information in a short amount of time. Students are often forced to cram after improper time utilization or in efforts to understand information shortly before being tested. Improper time management is usually the cause for last- minute cramming sessions, and many study techniques have been developed to help students succeed instead of cramming.How to Take on College Studying: Your Cramming Days are Over . CollegeBoard. Retrieved on 15 May 2009.How to Cram (Even Though You Shouldn't) . Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. Retrieved on 15 May 2009. Is also used to say that someone has hurt themselves (Synonym)  School performance  Teaching students to avoid last-minute cramming is a large area of concern for education professionals and profit for educational corporations and businesses. Learning and teaching study techniques that enhance retention as opposed to learning for a single examination is one of the core issues that plagues colleges and university academic advisors, and also adds to the stress of academic success for students. Ideally, proper study skills need to be introduced and practiced as early as possible in order for students to effectively learn positive study mechanisms. According to William G. Sommer, students in a university system often adapt to the time-constraints that are placed upon them in college, and often use cramming to perform well on tests. In his article, Procrastination and Cramming: How Adept Students Ace the System, he states \\"Many students outwardly adapt to this system, however, engage in an intense and private ritual that comprises five aspects: calculated procrastination, preparatory anxiety, climactic cramming, nick-of- time deadline-making, and a secret, if often uncelebrated, victory. These adept students often find it difficult to admit others into their efficient program of academic survival.\\"  Conclusion  Active learning and critical thinking are two methods which emphasize the retention of material through the use of class discussions, study groups and individual thinking. Each has been cited as a more effective means of learning and retaining information as compared to cramming and memorization.

It is one of the constituent laboratories of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), an Indian industrial research and development organisation situated at Chandigarth's Sector 30C. Overview CSIO was established in October 1959 as a laboratory which works on the research, design, and development of scientific and industrial instruments. It was located in New Delhi, and then moved to Chandigarh in 1962. The first Director was Piara Singh Gill.Up Against Odds: Autobiography of an Indian Scientist. (South Asia Books, 1993. ) CSIO campus (spread over an area of approximately 120 acres) comprises office buildings, R&D; laboratories, Indo-Swiss Training Centre and a housing complex. A building and the accompanying workshops were inaugurated in December 1967. Another block was added in 1976 for housing the R&D; Divisions and library. During the mid-1980s the laboratory buildings and infrastructural facilities were modernized. An Administration Block was inaugurated in September 1994. With a view to meeting the demand for instrument technologists, the Indo-Swiss Training Centre (ISTC) was started in December 1963 with the co-operation of Swiss Foundation for Technical Assistance, Zurich, Switzerland. CSIO is under the Physical Sciences Cluster of CSIR. CSIR-CSIO has signed an MoU with CSIR-IMTECH Chandigarh on 28 April 2012 for collaborative research work. CSIO has infrastructural facilities in the areas of microelectronics, optics, applied physics, electronics, and mechanical engineering. R&D; programmes are in food & agriculture, health and rehabilitation, avionics, snow and seismic monitoring in strategic sector, landslide and structure health monitoring for public safety, and bio and nano sciences. A large number of instruments have been developed by the Institute and their know-how have been passed on to the industry for commercial exploitation. The laboratory provides a two-year postgraduate research programme in Engineering (PGRPE) in 'Advanced Instrumentation Engineering' the only such program in India. The students are designated as Quick Hire Scientist Trainee QHS(T). The areas of research are Optics and Photonics, Bio- Medical Instrumentation and Agrionics. After the completion of 1-year course work taught by the senior scientists of the organization they are given a one- year project work as their thesis. Campus CSIO campus is situated on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway which houses the laboratories and workshops, Indo- Swiss Training Centre (ISTC) and residential complex. Amenities on campus include Clinical Centre, Crèche, Community Centre, Health Club and Adult Park. There are 250 dwelling units catering for the employees. A hostel is available for students from engineering institutions and universities undergoing their thesis/project/training. A guest-house with 16 rooms is on campus. A canteen facility exists for all the employees and students. The vacant Type-I accommodation in the campus is being renovated with provision for internet facility for accommodating the Scientist Trainees and a 50-room hostel is proposed to be constructed for them. Dining and Common Room facilities would be provided in for Scientist Trainees. Laboratories CSIO has labs engaged in R&D; programmes of the institute. A number of these labs and facilities have been earmarked for carrying out research/project/thesis of MTech/PhD level scholars. They can accommodate additional 3-5 Scientist Trainees each while a similar number would be allowed from other institutions. Three basic (common to all streams) labs exist (already catering MTech (Mechatraonics) students). Additional two labs are easily configurable from the related R&D; groups. In all the three departments for the chosen streams, sitting space for accommodating the Scientist Trainees is being created with office amenities including computer, internet, printing, phone/fax facility. The CSIO's IT cell would extend the services to the Scientist Trainees. Similarly, administrative requirements including national travel and outstation stay/accommodation of the TSs would be met initially by the existing CSIO establishments till independent arrangements are made. The Scientist Trainees would be considered as team members for international collaborations and funds for fees/travel/etc would be sought from different sources including CSIO/CSIR and other government funding schemes. Library CSIO library has a seating capacity of about 40 persons and has 50,000 books and standards covering science, engineering, technology, management and multidisciplinary areas. 92 journals are subscribed by the library and there is access to 2000 on-line e-journals within the campus. The library has arrangements with other local institutions as well as the National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR) for emergent requirement of literature and books. Faculty CSIO has been playing a role in human resource development in terms of running MTech (Instrumentation) affiliated to Panjab University (PU), Chandigarh which was initiated at CSIO in 1994 and was run by the CSIO faculty using internal laboratory facilities for three consecutive years before it was shifted to PU. The scientists here were also involved in conception, design and implementation of another programme [MTech (Microelectronics)] programme in 1998 in association with Semiconductor Complex Ltd (now called Semiconductor Laboratory), Mohali (Pb) being run by PU, Chandigarh. Another Masters programme [MTech(Nanosciences)] has been initiated in 2006 in PU, Chandigarh. CSIO has jointly initiated an MTech (Mechatronics) programme with Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI), Durgapur and Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute (CEERI), Pilani in affiliation with Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, Kolkataformerly known as Bengal Engineering Science University (BESU). This programme is run jointly by the faculty of the all the four institutions involved. Scientists supervise project training and thesis work of a large number of B.Tech and MTech students respectively. A number of Junior Research Fellows (JRFs) and Senior Research Fellows (SRFs) pursue their research work at CSIO for MTech/PhD. CSIO has MoUs with universities, institutions and industries resulting in a regular flow of students and research problems. CSIO scientists are members of Boards of Studies (BoSs) and Research Degree Committees (RDCs) of universities and institutions. Scientists have been identified to serve as faculty at CSIO Chandigarh. They comprise PhDs and MTechs and some of them are pursuing their PhD. All are MTechs and PhDs from institutions such as IITs, BITS, and NITs. Some of them have gained experience as postdoctorates from abroad. International research publications have emanated from the research work carried out by the scientists. About a dozen PhDs have been supervised by some of the senior faculty members in the last decade while currently more than 20 PhDs and about 35 MTech students are pursuing their thesis. The January session in 2011 attracted registration of six PhDs in the organisation in both science and engineering. In the last few years, more than 50 patents have been filed by them and granted while many are under process.

He published studies on the Roman civilization, of which many volumes to the \\"Que sais-je?\\" series, and translations of Latin classical authors (Cicero, Seneca the Younger, Tacitus, Plautus, Terence). On his retirement, he also published biographies and fictionalized histories (Mémoires d’Agrippine, le procès Néron), more intended for the general public. At the end of his life, he campaigned for the safeguarding of literary teaching.

It is also a residential area, that was once a settlement and the site of a tuberculosis sanatorium. The University of Colorado Colorado Springs campus was moved there in 1965. Geology The rock in Austin Bluffs is from the Dawson Arkose, Arapahoe Formation, Denver Formation, and Eocene period of the Tertiary. Sedimentary sandstone and arkosic sandstone formations are evident due to a geological uplift in the area about 65 to 70 million years ago. Due to its rock formations, the United States Forest Service has deemed the open space as unique in the National Feature Inventory. History There is archaeological evidence that Native Americans lived in the Austin Bluffs area thousands of years ago, and perhaps as early as 10,000 years ago. There are more than a dozen sites that show that the area was used to quarry for stone for lithic tools. There are 30 sites that show signs of occupation between 100 and 1,400 AD by Plains Indians, including evidence of charcoal fires, on the west side of the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. There are also stone enclosures that may have been Ute vision quest sites. In the 1870s, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway operated a railroad line along Monument Creek and what is now the western edge of the campus. Matt France sold the prairie land and bluffs that he owned northeast of Colorado Springs in 1873 to Henry Austin. Out West reported on November 7, 1872 that Mr. Austin of Chicago had purchased of land on the northeastern boundary of the newly formed Colorado Springs. Austin, for whom Austin Bluffs are named, was a wealthy sheep ranch owner of . Austin hired Hispanic shepherds from southern Colorado and New Mexico to tend his sheep in the 1880s. Photographer Laura Gilpin was born in Austin Bluffs, which was more accessible for a doctor than the family ranch on Horse Creek. Austin Bluffs began to be annexed into the city of Colorado Springs beginning December 1888 and in many sections from 1894 to 2013. In 1890, plans to make Austin Bluffs were underway: the area had its own water system, had laid out the lots for residential housing, and was added to Colorado Springs trolley service. Water was piped to the area from West Monument Creek by the Austin Bluffs Land and Water Company. Nordach Sanatorium, Austin Bluffs, Colorado 1906, Special Collections, Pikes Peak Library District In 1901, Dr. John E. White opened the Nordrach Ranch Sanatorium. Located at Austin Bluff, patients lodged in tents, were exposed to fresh air, had limited physical activity, and ate well. The regimen was based upon a German sanatorium that had seen good results with this approach. The Keystone Fuel Company of Colorado Springs operated the Austin Bluffs Mine, a lignite coal mine in Austin Bluffs, by 1905. By 1910, new tipple and machinery were installed. east of Highway 85-87 (Nevada Avenue), on the southwest side of the bluffs, was a place where red and brown agate and cherry red carnelian were collected. The Cragmor Sanatorium, a tuberculosis clinic and nursing home, operated in Austin Bluffs in the early 1900s. Land that was owned by Henry Austin is now part of the University of Colorado Colorado Springs campus. In 1965, the sanatorium was sold by George J. Dwire to the University of Colorado for one dollar to build an extension campus in Colorado Springs. It has since grown into a campus. University of Colorado University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) has an annual enrollment of about 10,500 students with a staff and faculty of about 1,000 people. The campus has residential housing, a library, and a science and engineering center. Historic buildings are Dwire Hall, Cragmor Hall, and the original Main Hall. Other facilities include a recreation center, sports complex, theatre, events center, and a family development center.

It lies along U.S. Highway 412, near the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line. The property was privately-owned and known as Dripping Springs until 1990, when the state bought it. The previous owners had also used the property as an attraction and rest stop for travelers on the highway, featuring a swimming pool and gardens. The site was used in the production of the 1974 film \\"Where the Red Fern Grows\\".  Features  Located in northeast Oklahoma in the scenic Ozark Highlands region, Natural Falls State Park features a waterfall cascading through rock formations and creating a hidden, serene atmosphere at the bottom of a narrow V-shaped valley. An observation platform with a nearby picnic pavilion overlooks the falls and a deck with seating is available at the base of the falls. As the stream falls, enough evaporation occurs to drop the bulk liquid temperature about ten degrees (Fahrenheit) by the time it reaches the bottom. This maintains a cool, moist environment that is favorable to the growth of many types of flora in the valley. A graduate student from Oklahoma State University (OSU) performed a plant study at the site about the time it was purchased by the state, and counted over 18 varieties of ferns alone. Since preserving the plant life is a priority for park management,swimming has been prohibited in the catchment ever since. Picnic tables and grills can be found throughout the park. Campsites, including 44 RV sites and 27 tent sites, and a comfort station with showers are also on site. The park offers yurts for a rather unique overnighting experience, now called glamping. At Natural Falls State Park, each yurt is a circular tent that sits above ground on a wooden deck. There are different sizes, accommodating from two to eight people. Each is equipped with beds, refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave, skylights, and even air- conditioning.Lalli, Dino. \\"Discover Oklahoma: Natural Falls State Park even has yurts, too!.\\" The Oklahoman. July 22, 2019. Accessed September 20, 2019. According to Tracey Robertson, park manager, the park installed five yurts which can be rented by park visitors.Crawford, Grant C. \\"Hidden Gems: Waterfall of 77 feet highlights state park.\\" Talequah Daily Press. June 28, 2018. Accessed September 21, 2019. The Red Fern Reunion Center is available for group functions. Other amenities include a long hiking and nature trail, picnic shelter, volleyball, horseshoes, basketball court, catch and release fishing, playgrounds, and formal garden area. Pets are allowed on a leash only. The park affords an opportunity to observe a variety of plant and animal life. Hikers will find a dense forest of maples, chinquapin, and white oaks, while plants such as flowering dogwood, sassafras, coralberry, spicebush, redbud, and pawpaw blanket the cool forest floor. The waterfall creates a moist environment where ferns, mosses, and liverworts thrive. It includes a waterfall which is tall. This is one of the two tallest known waterfalls in the state, matching Turner Falls in the Arbuckle Mountains. The falls are known to local residents as Dripping Springs Falls, but the State renamed the park as Natural Falls to distinguish it from Dripping Springs State Park, now known as Dripping Springs Park, and other sites in Oklahoma with similar names. The park can pump water from the pool below the falls back to the top of the falls, to insure that the waterfall is active all year long.  Accessibility  Most visitors arrive by private auto, since there is no public transportation in the area. The park is located on U.S. Highway 412. A parking lot is about from the viewing platform at the head of the falls. The route complies with requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Fees To help fund a backlog of deferred maintenance and park improvements, the state implemented an entrance fee for this park and 21 others effective June 15, 2020. The fees, charged per vehicle, start at $10 per day for a single-day or $8 for residents with an Oklahoma license plate or Oklahoma tribal plate. Fees are waived for honorably discharged veterans and Oklahoma residents age 62 & older and their spouses.

He worked as a judge of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales from 1999 to 2011 and is currently a visiting professor at the University of Oxford. Background Sedley's father was Bill Sedley (1910–1985), of a Jewish immigrant family, who operated a legal advice service in the East End of London in the 1930s.Morning Star 7 July 1985Encyclopædia Britannica: The Mortgage Strikes In Second World War he served in North Africa and Italy with the Eighth Army.Diary, Stephen Sedley, London Review of Books, 11 November 1999 Bill Sedley founded the firm of lawyers of Seifert and Sedley in the 1940s with Sigmund Seifert and was a lifelong Communist. His younger brother is Professor David Sedley. Legal career After graduation from Queens' College, Cambridge, Sedley was called to the Bar (Inner Temple) in 1964 and practised in Cloisters chambers with John Platts-Mills, David Turner-Samuels and Michael Mansfield. Sedley had a particular interest in the development of administrative law (the judicial review of governmental and administrative decision making). He was involved in cases which broadened the scope of judicial review and established the modern procedure for judicial review,See e.g. O'Reilly v Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237. and in ground-breaking cases in relation to employment rights, sex and race discrimination, prisoners' rights, coroners' inquests, immigration and asylum and freedom of speech. He was counsel in many high-profile cases and inquiries, from the death of Blair Peach and the Carl Bridgewater murder appeal to the Helen Smith inquest and the contempt hearing against Kenneth Baker, then Home Secretary.The Independent, 17 September 1992 In 1976, Sedley attended, as one of a group of \\"observers\\", the \\"Luanda Trial\\", sometimes called \\"the Mercenaries' Trial\\", held by the then recently-victorious MPLA government in Luanda, Angola. He became a QC in 1983. He was appointed a High Court judge in 1992, serving in the Queen's Bench Division. In 1999 he was appointed to the Court of Appeal as a Lord Justice of Appeal.Court of Appeal website He was a Judge ad hoc of the European Court of Human Rights and a Member ad hoc of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.Oxford Law: Profile Sir Stephen Sedley His retirement from the Court of Appeal in 2011 coincided with the publication of a collection of his essays and lectures.Thom Dyke, The Guardian, 28 April 2011 Notable judicial opinions As a first instance judge, Sedley delivered important judgments in the field of administrative law, notably in relation to the concept of legitimate expectation as a ground for judicial review,R v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd. [1995] 2 All ER 714. and the duty to give reasons.R v Higher Education Funding Council, ex parte Institute of Dental Surgery [1994] 1 WLR 242. In the Court of Appeal he was one of the first English judges to recognise the right of privacy as an aspect of human autonomy and dignity,Douglas v Hello! Ltd [2001] QB 967. and was influential in developing the now well-established principle of proportionality (which he described as a \\"metwand\\" for balancing competing rights) in the fields of human rights and judicial review. His dissenting judgments in two appeals in 2008 concerning anti-terrorist measures were eventually to be vindicated on appeal to the House of Lords and in the first appeal to be heard by the Supreme Court in 2009.Secretary of State for Home Department v AF & Ors [2008] EWCA Civ 1148, [2009] 2 WLR 423 and A & Ors v HM Treasury [2008] EWCA Civ 1187, [2009] 3 WLR 25. His judgment in the Chagos Islanders litigation developed the ambit of modern judicial review,R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2) [2008] QB 365. and in a judgment in 2010 he developed his view that the basis for judicial review is to control abuse of power.Gibb v Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust [2010] IRLR 786 at [55]. He also made a number of judgments in the field of immigration and asylum law. Always interested in freedom of speech his judgments also made important contributions to the modernisation of libel law.See e.g. British Chiropractic Association v Singh [2011] 1 WLR 133. His formulation of the real significance of freedom of expression in a case involving the unlawful arrest of a street preacher has been much quoted: \\"Free speech includes not only the inoffensive but the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome and the provocative provided it does not tend to provoke violence. Freedom only to speak inoffensively is not worth having.\\"Redmond Bate v DPP (2000) 7 BHRC 375. \\"Sedley's Laws of Documents\\" He formulated what has come to be known as \\"Sedley's Laws of Documents\\" after experiencing the tribulations of litigation:Spigelman J J, \\"Expert Witnesses: Forensic accounting in an adversary system\\", NSW Law Society Journal, October 2003, p. 60, http://www.lawsociety.com.au/resources/journal/index.htm # Documents may be assembled in any order, provided it is not chronological, numerical or alphabetical. # Documents shall in no circumstances be paginated continuously. # No two copies of any bundle shall have the same pagination. # Every document shall carry at least 3 numbers in different places. # Any important documents shall be omitted. # At least 10 per cent of the documents shall appear more than once in the bundle. # As many photocopies as practicable shall be illegible, truncated or cropped. # Significant passages shall be marked with a highlighter which goes black when photocopied. # (a) At least 80 per cent of the documents shall be irrelevant. (b) Counsel shall refer in Court to no more than 5 per cent of the documents, but these may include as many irrelevant ones as counsel or solicitor deems appropriate. # Only one side of any double- sided document shall be reproduced. # Transcriptions of manuscript documents and translations of foreign documents shall bear as little relation as reasonably practicable to the original. # Documents shall be held together, in the absolute discretion of the solicitor assembling them, by: a steel pin sharp enough to injure the reader; a staple too short to penetrate the full thickness of the bundle; tape binding so stitched that the bundle cannot be fully opened; or a ring or arch-binder, so damaged that the arcs do not meet. Important articles Sedley has provoked considerable debate about the role of government in collecting and keeping DNA samples. At present criminal suspects detained by the police in the UK are automatically given cheek swabs and their DNA kept, in perpetuity, by the government. This has created the situation where different races are differently represented in the United Kingdom National DNA Database. On the grounds that this situation is indefensible, Lord Justice Sedley discussed the case for a blanket DNA collection policy, including collecting samples from all visitors to the UK.2004 Leicester University Lecture, published in the London Review of Books, Vol 27, No 2, 20 January 2005; Ashes and Sparks pp 213-24. The BBC misreported his views on this issue on 5/9/2007. Ian McEwan said of Ashes and Sparks: Essays on Law and Justice (Cambridge University Press, 2011) \\"you could have no interest in the law and read his book for pure intellectual delight, for the exquisite, finely balanced prose, the prickly humor, the knack of artful quotation and an astonishing historical grasp\\".New York Times, 6/12/12. In February 2012, the London Review of Books published an essay by Sedley in which he criticized soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Sumption's FA Mann lecture. In this lecture, Sumption had argued that the judiciary had overstepped the boundary between its legitimate judicial function and illegitimate political decision making in the context of the remedy of judicial review.London Review of Books, Vol 34, No 4, 23 February 2012, http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n04/stephen-sedley/judicial-politics The critique centred on Sedley's conceptions of the precise interplay of the judicial, legislative, and executive branches, and made reference to the grey areas within which Parliament had not expressed any set opinion.

It is located in present-day Toyokawa, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. It was only from Goyu-juku, the preceding post station. History Along with the preceding Yoshida-juku and Goyu- shuku, Akasaka-juku was well known for its meshimori onna. The classic ukiyo-e print by Andō Hiroshige (Hoeido edition) from 1831–1834 depicts a typical inn; the scene is divided in half by a sago palm in the center. To the right, travellers are taking their evening meal, and to the left, prostitutes are putting on make-up and preparing for the evening entertainment. Due to its reputation, Akasaka was a popular post station with many travellers. Ōhashi- yaŌhashi-ya (大橋屋), an inn that first opened in 1649, less than half a century after the creation of the Tōkaidō, still operates today. The building it uses was built in 1716. During a census in 1733, there were 83 inns in Akasaka- juku, but only Ōhashi-ya remains today. At its peak, though, there were 349 buildings, including three honjin, one sub-honjin and 62 hatago. Goyu-shuku was less than 2 km from Akasaka-juku, making them the closest stations on the whole of the Tōkaidō. At Sekigawa Shrine (関川神社) in Otowa, Matsuo Bashō wrote the following haiku, because they were so close: :夏の月 御油より出でて 赤坂や :Natsu no tsuki / Goyu yori idete / Akasaka ya. :\\"By the summer moon, / depart out from Goyu and / reach Akasaka.\\" When the construction of the Tōkaidō Main Line bypassed the area, it missed out on many of the economic advantages that the railroad brought. Furthermore, even though the area gained connections to rail networks with the construction of the Meitetsu Nagoya Main Line, it was still unable to flourish because none of the express trains stopped at Meiden- Akasaka Station.

He was the father of Prime Minister William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne. Early life Lamb was the son of Sir Matthew Lamb, 1st Baronet, and his wife Charlotte (née Coke). He was educated at Eton College from 1755 to 1762 and entered Lincolns Inn in 1769. He succeeded in the baronetcy on his father's death on 6 November 1768 and inherited Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire. He married Elizabeth Milbanke (1751–1818), daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, 5th Baronet, on 13 April 1769. She was a young woman of great beauty, intelligence and strong character, who quickly came to dominate her husband completely, and steered them into the centre of polite society. In 1770 he began, as Melbourne House, what is now The Albany in London. Political career At the 1768 general election Lamb was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Ludgershall. In 1770 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Lord Melbourne, Baron of Kilmore, in the County of Cavan, but as it was an Irish peerage he was allowed to remain in the House of Commons. He was returned unopposed again as MP for Ludgershall at the elections in 1774 and 1780. In 1781 he was created Viscount Melbourne, of Kilmore in the County of Cavan, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales in 1783 and held the position until 1796. At the 1784 general election he stood for Malmesbury and was again returned unopposed. He switched again in 1790 and was returned unopposed at Newport, Isle of Wight. He resigned his seat in 1793 for his son Peniston. Later life Lord Melbourne became Lord of the Bedchamber in 1812. In 1815 he was even further honoured when he was made Baron Melbourne, of Melbourne in the County of Derby, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He died on 22 July 1828, aged 83 and was succeeded in his titles by his son William. Family Lady Melbourne with her eldest son Melbourne and his wife had six children. * Hon.

Their one serious quarrel was caused by the death of their eldest son Pen (who was undoubtedly Melbourne's child); he angrily refused to make the same allowance to William (who was almost certainly not Melbourne's child) as he had given Pen, suggesting that he felt some degree of resentment of his wife's conduct. Lady Melbourne, on her side, tolerated his affair with the courtesan Sophia Baddeley. Nathaniel Wraxall wrote of Melbourne that he was \\"principally known by the distinguished place that he occupies in the annals of meretricious pleasure, the memoirs of Mrs. Bellamy or Mrs. Baddeley, the sirens and courtesans of a former age\\". Melbourne's children regarded him with what has been described as \\"kindly contempt\\": his daughter Emily said that he was always going wrong and they were always having to put him right, and that although he was not a heavy drinker, he always seemed drunk.

A third incident, again with a SAS aircraft, occurred in October 2007, leading to the withdrawal of the type from the airline's fleet. Scandinavian Airlines Flight 1209 Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 registration LN-RDK was the first SAS aircraft to have a landing gear failure Scandinavian Airlines Flight 1209, a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 with the registration LN-RDK, took off from Copenhagen Airport, Denmark, on September 9, 2007. It was on a domestic flight to Aalborg Airport. Prior to landing, the right main landing gear failed to lock and the crew circled for an hour while trying to fix the problem then preparing for an emergency landing. After the aircraft touched down, the right landing gear collapsed, the right wing hit the ground, and a fire broke out. The fire went out before the aircraft came to rest and all passengers and crew were evacuated. Five people suffered minor injuries, some from parts of the propeller entering the cabin and others from the evacuation. =Investigation= SAS Dash-8-400 LN-RDS after crash-landing at Vilnius airport When the handle for lowering the landing gear was activated, the indicator showed two green and one red light. The red light indicated that the right main gear was not locked in position. The landing was aborted. Attempts at lowering the gear manually were also unsuccessful. An investigation into the cause of the failure to deploy revealed that the right main gear hydraulic actuator eyebolt had broken away from the actuator. A further analysis of the actuator showed corrosion of the threads on both the inside threads of the piston rod and the outside threads of the rod end, leading to reduced mechanical strength of the actuator and eventual failure. On September 19, 2007, the prosecutor of Stockholm commenced a preliminary investigation regarding suspicion of creating danger to another person. =Maintenance procedures= Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was accused of cutting corners in the maintenance of its Q400 aircraft. As the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration began an investigation of the accident, it brought renewed focus on SAS maintenance procedures. (Only two weeks previously, Swedish authorities had levelled a scathing critique at the airline after an aircraft of the same model nearly crashed because its engine accelerated unexpectedly during landing.) The final outcome of the investigation was that the cause was not a lack of maintenance but over-cleaning of the landing gear, with pressure washers being used that washed out the corrosion preventative coatings between the eyebolt and the actuator rod end. The airline reportedly made 2,300 flights in which safety equipment was not up to standard, although the airline denied this. AIB Denmark (Havarikommissionen) noted that the use of different alloys in the bolt and surrounding construction was most probably a contributing factor: \\"It is evident that the corrosion had attacked the piston rod threads that were in direct engagement with the rod end threads whereas the corrosion attacked in the key way area and in the non-engaged threads was less severe. This suggested that galvanic action between the nobler martensitic stainless steel and the less noble 4340 steel material had enhanced corrosion.\\"https://reports.aviation- safety.net/2007/20070909-0_DH8D_LN-RDK.pdf  Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2748  A second Bombardier Q400, operating as Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2748, took off from Copenhagen Airport, Denmark, on September 12, 2007. It was headed to Palanga, Lithuania, but was diverted to Vilnius International Airport when landing gear problems were discovered before landing. Again, the right landing gear collapsed immediately after the aircraft touched down. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely. The local officials at Vilnius International Airport noted that this was the most serious incident in recent years. This accident was also caused by corroded threads in the piston rod and rod end. Scandinavian Airlines Flight 2867 On October 27, 2007, a Q400 registered LN-RDI was operating SAS Flight 2867 from Bergen, Norway to Copenhagen, Denmark with 40 passengers and 4 crew members when problems with the main landing gear were discovered. After waiting about two hours in the air to burn fuel and troubleshoot, the pilots attempted a prepared emergency landing. The pilots were forced to land the aircraft with the right main landing gear up. The right engine was shut down prior to the landing, because in the previous landings the propeller had hit the ground and shards of it ripped into the fuselage. This was not on the emergency checklist, rather it was the pilots making a safety-based decision. The aircraft stopped on the runway at 16:53 local time with the right wing touching the surface. It did not catch fire and the passengers and the crew were evacuated quickly. There were no serious injuries. The aircraft in question was one of six that had been cleared to fly just a month before, following the grounding of the entire Scandinavian Airlines Q400 fleet due to similar landing gear issues. The entire fleet was grounded again following the accident. The preliminary Danish investigation determined this latest Q400 incident was unrelated to the airline's earlier corrosion problems; in this particular case being caused by a misplaced o-ring found blocking the orifice in a hydraulic restrictor valve. Accordingly, the European Aviation Safety Agency announced that \\"...the Scandinavian airworthiness authorities will reissue the Certificates of Airworthiness relevant to this aircraft type in the coming days\\". The final report stated: Aftermath After the second incident in Vilnius, SAS grounded its entire Q400 fleet consisting of 27 aircraft, and a few hours later the manufacturer Bombardier Aerospace recommended that all Q400 aircraft with more than 10,000 flights stay grounded until further notice, affecting about 60 of the 160 Q400 aircraft then in service worldwide. As a result, several hundred flights were cancelled around the world. Horizon Air grounded nineteen of its aircraft and Austrian Airlines grounded eight. On September 13, 2007, Transport Canada issued an Airworthiness Directive applicable to Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft instructing all Q400 aircraft operators to conduct a general visual inspection of the left and right main landing gear systems and main landing gear retract actuator jam nuts. This effectively grounded all Q400 aircraft until the inspection had been carried out. Bombardier Supports Transport Canada Airworthiness Directive Related To Recent Q400 Landing Gear IssueEMERGENCY AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVE AD No : 2007-0252-E On September 14, 2007, Bombardier issued an All-Operators Message (AOM) recommending new procedures concerning the landing gear inspection for all aircraft with more than 8,000 flights. Bombardier acknowledged the likelihood of corrosion developing inside the retract actuator. Previous maintenance procedures mandated checking this component after 15,000 landings. The new maintenance schedule affected about 85 of the 165 Q400 aircraft worldwide. Some operators found that spare parts for this unexpected actuator replacement program were not available, grounding their aircraft indefinitely. Investigators detected corrosion inside actuators on 25 of 27 aircraft they checked. Accordingly, SAS decided to continue the grounding of its Q400 fleet until all the affected parts were replaced. On October 28, 2007, SAS announced that it would retire its entire fleet of Q400 aircraft after a third accident involving the landing gear occurred the day prior. On March 10, 2008, a multi- party agreement was announced, attempting to finalize the roles of maintenance and manufacture in causing the SAS accidents; as settlement the airline and its partners ordered a replacement set of short-haul aircraft from Bombardier, and in turn received a US$164 million discount. It has been speculated that a November 2007 shakeup of Bombardier management was spurred by the Q400 landing gear issues.

Characteristics of Pinter's work =Pinteresque= \\"That Harold Pinter occupies a position as a modern classic is illustrated by his name entering the language as an adjective used to describe a particular atmosphere and environment in drama: 'Pinteresque' \\"–placing him in the company of authors considered unique or influential enough to elicit eponymous adjectives.\\"Biobibliographical Notes\\" in \\"Bio-bibliography\\" for Harold Pinter, by The Swedish Academy, The Nobel Prize in Literature 2005, The Nobel Foundation, NobelPrize.org, Oct. 2005, precede a \\"Bibliography\\" of selected publications (mostly in English but also including some in French, German, and Swedish), compiled by the Swedish Academy. (These notes include the full Nobel Prize \\"Citation\\".) Susan Harris Smith observes: The Online OED (2006) defines Pinteresque more explicitly: \\"Resembling or characteristic of his plays. … Pinter's plays are typically characterized by implications of threat and strong feeling produced through colloquial language, apparent triviality, and long pauses.\\"Another version of the OED is cited in the BBC press release about Pinter at the BBC (10 Oct 2002): \\"[']Pinteresque pin-ter-esk', adj. in the style of the characters, situations, etc., of the plays of Harold Pinter, 20th-cent. English dramatist, marked esp. by halting dialogue, uncertainty of identity, and air of menace.\\" The \\"Draft Revision\\" (June 2005) of this entry in the Oxford English Dictionary Online (2006) is: > Pinteresque, adj. (and n.) Brit. /pntrsk/, US /pn(t)rsk/ [< the name of > Harold Pinter (b. 1930), British playwright + -ESQUE suffix. Cf. PINTERISH > adj.] > Of or relating to Harold Pinter; resembling or characteristic of his plays. > Also occas. as n. Pinter's plays are typically characterised by implications > of threat and strong feeling produced through colloquial language, apparent > triviality, and long pauses. The Swedish Academy defines characteristics of the Pinteresque in greater detail: Over the years Pinter himself has \\"always been very dismissive when people have talked about languages and silences and situations as being 'Pinteresque',\\" observes Kirsty Wark in their interview on Newsnight Review broadcast on 23 June 2006; she wonders, \\"Will you finally acknowledge there is such a thing as a 'Pinteresque' moment?\\" \\"No,\\" Pinter replies, \\"I've no idea what it means. Never have. I really don't.… I can detect where a thing is 'Kafkaesque' or 'Chekhovian' [Wark's examples],\\" but with respect to the \\"Pinteresque\\", he says, \\"I can't define what it is myself. You use the term 'menace' and so on. I have no explanation of any of that really. What I write is what I write.\\" =Comedy of menace= Once asked what his plays are about, Pinter lobbed back a phrase \\"the weasel under the cocktail cabinet\\", which he regrets has been taken seriously and applied in popular criticism: Despite Pinter's protestations to the contrary, many reviewers and other critics consider the remark, though facetious, an apt description of his plays. For although Pinter repudiated it, it does contain an important clue about his relationship to English dramatic tradition (Sofer 29); \\"Mr. Pinter … is celebrated for what the critic Irving Wardle has called 'the comedy of menace' \\" (Brantley, \\"Harold Pinter\\"; cf. \\"A Master of Menace\\" [multimedia presentation]). In December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about Old Times, Mel Gussow recalled that \\"After The Homecoming [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out. Landscape and Silence [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between The Homecoming and Old Times] are in a very different form. There isn't any menace at all.' \\" Later, when he asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had \\"tired\\" of \\"menace\\", Pinter added: \\"when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin. I never thought of menace myself. It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago. I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights]. But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration.\\"Qtd. in Gussow, Conversations with Pinter 18, 24. =Two silences= The \\"Pinter Silence\\" Among the most-commonly cited of Pinter's comments on his own work are his remarks about two kinds of silence (\\"two silences\\"), including his objections to \\"that tired, grimy phrase 'failure of communication',\\" as defined in his speech to the National Student Drama Festival in Bristol in 1962, incorporated in his published version of the speech entitled \\"Writing for the Theatre\\": In his \\"Presentation Speech\\" of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature to Harold Pinter, in absentia, Swedish writer Per Wästberg, Member of the Swedish Academy and Chairman of its Nobel Committee, observes: \\"The abyss under chat, the unwillingness to communicate other than superficially, the need to rule and mislead, the suffocating sensation of accidents bubbling under the quotidian, the nervous perception that a dangerous story has been censored – all this vibrates through Pinter's drama.\\" The \\"Pinter Pause\\" One of the \\"two silences\\"–when Pinter's stage directions indicate pause and silence when his characters are not speaking at all–has become a \\"trademark\\" of Pinter's dialogue called the \\"Pinter pause\\": \\"During the 1960s, Pinter became famous–nay, notorious–for his trademark: 'The Pinter pause' \\" (Filichia). Actors and directors often find Pinter's \\"pauses and silences\\" to be daunting elements of performing his plays, leading to much discussion of them in theatrical and dramatic criticism, and actors who have worked with Pinter in rehearsals have \\"reported that he regretted ever starting to write 'Pause' as a stage direction, because it often leads to portentous overacting\\" (Jacobson). Speaking about their experiences of working with Pinter in rehearsing director Carey Perloff's 1989 double bill of The Birthday Party and Mountain Language (for Classic Stage Company), American actors David Strathairn and Peter Riegert agreed with Jean Stapleton that \\"Pinter's comments … 'freed' the cast from feeling reverential about his pauses,\\" and, while Strathairn \\"believes pauses can be overdone,\\" he also \\"thinks Pinter's are distinctive: 'The natural ones always seem to be right where he wrote them. His pause or beat comes naturally in the rhythm of the conversation. [As an actor, you] find yourself pausing in mid-sentence, thinking about what you just said or are going to say.…' \\" Perloff said: \\"He didn't want them weighted that much. … He kept laughing that everybody made such a big deal about it.' He wanted them honored, she said, but not as 'these long, heavy, psychological pauses, where people look at each other filled with pregnant meaning' \\" (Jacobson). More recently, in an article elliptically headlined \\"Cut the Pauses … Says Pinter\\", a London Sunday Times television program announcement for Harry Burton's documentary film Working With Pinter, Olivia Cole observes that he \\"made brooding silence into an art form, but after 50 years Harold Pinter has said directors should be free to cut his trademark pauses if they want.…\\" In Working With Pinter (shown on British television's More 4 in February 2007), Cole writes, Pinter \\"says he has been misunderstood. He maintains that while others detected disturbing undertones, he merely intended basic stage directions\\" in writing \\"pause\\" and \\"silence\\". She quotes Pinter's remarks from Working With Pinter: Exemplifying the frequency and relative duration of pauses in Pinter's plays, Cole observes that \\"Pinter wrote 140 pauses into his work Betrayal, 149 into The Caretaker and 224 into The Homecoming. The longest are typically 10 seconds.\\" Pinter's having encouraged actors to \\"cut\\" his pauses and silences–with the important qualification \\"if they don't make any sense\\" (elided in Cole's headline)–has \\"bemused directors\\", according to Cole, who quotes Pinter's longtime friend and director Sir Peter Hall as saying \\"that it would be a 'failure' for a director or actor to ignore the pauses\\": Cole concludes that Hall added, however, that, in Working With Pinter, Pinter \\"was right to criticise productions in which actors were fetishising their pauses\\". Quoting J. Barry Lewis, the director of a recent production of Betrayal, by Palm Beach Dramaworks, Lisa Cohen observes that Pinter has \\"even entered popular culture with what is called 'the Pinter pause,' a term that describes … those silent moments 'filled with unspoken dialogue' that occur throughout his plays.\\"Beau Higgins, in \\"A Pinter Play – 'Betrayal'\\", broadwayworld.com, Mar. 2007, accessed 6 September 2007, also reviews this production, which opened on 9 March 2007 and ran through 15 April 2007. Three other production revs. appear on the Palm Beach Dramaworks website; in one of them, Jan Sjostrom, \\"Dramaworks Stays True to Fine 'Betrayal'\\", Palm Beach Daily News, 19 March 2007, accessed 6 September 2007, states: \\"The show is impeccably directed by J. Barry Lewis, who ensures that no scene is overplayed and every unspoken nuance is communicated. And there are plenty of nuances in this play. In fact, what's left unsaid is as important as the dialogue.\\" Some examples of Pinter's influence on Anglo- American popular culture Allusions to \\"the Pinteresque\\" and to specific characteristics of Pinter's works and, more recently, to his politics pervade Anglo-American popular culture (OED; Susan Harris Smith; mass media accounts, as cited above). The Modern Language Association annual convention has already hosted two linked programs on \\"Pinter's Influence and Influences\\" and hosted another one relating to this subject in 2007 (Merritt, \\"Harold Pinter Bibliography: 2000–2002\\"; \\"Pinter Society Events\\", Harold Pinter Society website). Exemplifying Pinter's cultural influence for several decades, a line in \\"The Ladies Who Lunch\\", a song in Company, the 1970 Broadway musical by George Furth and Stephen Sondheim, alludes to Manhattanite \\"ladies who lunch\\" taking in \\"a Pinter play\\", \\"fashionable\\" at that time (Merritt, Pinter in Play 217).Furth and Sondheim's allusion to \\"a Pinter play\\" in \\"The Ladies Who Lunch\\" in Company is repeated by London theatre critic Mark Shenton, in his commentary entitled \\"A Matinee, a Pinter Play …\\" , The Stage (Blog), 9 October 2007, accessed 27 January 2009. Shenton segues from this allusion to \\"a matinee, a Pinter play\\" into the pleasures of attending afternoon matinees in general. Yet Pinter told John Barber ten years later, in 1980: \\"'This really is an awful business, this fashion. I must tell you I feel I've been unfashionable all my life. I was oldfashioned from the very beginning, and I'm unfashionable now, really.' \\"Qtd. in Merritt, Pinter in Play 3; cf. 217–18 & 278n12. Episode 164 of the very popular American television series Seinfeld, entitled \\"The Betrayal\\" (originally broadcast 27 November 1997), is structured in reverse somewhat like Pinter's play and film Betrayal. Jerry Seinfeld's comic parodic homage to Harold Pinter, the episode features a character named \\"Pinter\\".For production details, see . Since the first airing of that Seinfeld episode and since the subsequent release of films like Memento and other popular works with reversed chronological structures, some media accounts (such as that in the IMDb) refer to Pinter's plot device in his play and film as a mere \\"gimmick\\". But scholars and other critical reviewers consider the reversed structure a fully integrated ingenious stylistic means of heightening multiple kinds of ironies energising Betrayal's comedic wit, its cumulative poignancy, and its ultimate emotional impact on audiences, and the play has been produced throughout the United States, Britain, and parts of the rest of the world with increasing frequency.See Merritt, \\"Betrayal in Denver\\"; cf. Merritt, comp., \\"Harold Pinter Bibliography\\" (1987– ). A character in the fourth episode of the second season of Dawson's Creek, \\"Tamara's Return\\" (28 Oct 1998), alludes to Pinter's so-called \\"sub-textual\\" use of silence as \\"a classic 'Pinter' moment\\". In dialogue between lead character Pacey Witter (played by Joshua Jackson) and Tamara Jacobs (Leann Hunley), his former English teacher with whom Pacey has had an affair, Tamara tells Pacey that an awkward moment of silence between them is \\"what we ex-English teachers call a classic 'Pinter' moment, where everything is said in silence because the emotion behind what we really want to say is just too overwhelming. … silence is an acquired taste. The more complicated life becomes the better it is to learn to say nothing.\\" When Pacey inquires \\"Who is this Pinter guy?\\" Tamara urges him, \\"Stay in school.\\" Later Pacey tells Tamara that he has \\"looked up this Pinter guy. Harold, playwright, the king of subtext. You say one thing, but you mean another,\\" wondering further: \\"Do you think it's possible for us to have a moment without all the subtext?\\" \\"Uh, I don't know, Pacey,\\" Tamara replies. \\"Words have always gotten us into so much trouble.\\" Pacey and Tamara finally agree that \\"This Pinter guy was really onto something.\\"Season Two, Episode #204: \\"Tamara's Return\\", as listed in the official Episode Guide for Dawson's Creek, dawsonscreek.com, copyright 2007 Sony Pictures Digital, features a video link to different part of the same episode. There are no official scripts on that site. Unofficial transcripts containing this dialogue are posted online at derivative fansites like TVTwiz.com and Dawson's Creek \\"Script Archive\\".A discussion of critical controversies about Pinter's presumed use of \\"subtext\\" appears in \\"Some Other Language Games\\", chap. 7 in Merritt, Pinter in Play 137–70. Further alluding to Pinter's renowned \\"pauses and silences\\", the song \\"Up Against It\\", from the album Bilingual, by the English electronic music/pop music duo Pet Shop Boys, includes the lines: \\"Such a cold winter/With scenes as slow as Pinter\\" (Tennant and Lowe). Also illustrating the frequent allusions to Pinter's \\"silences\\" in commentaries about others' work, in a book review of Nick Hornby's \\"debut teenage novel\\" Slam (Penguin Books), Janet Christie observes hyperbolically that Hornby is \\"spot-on with the way a conversation with a teenage boy contains more meaningful silences than Harold Pinter's entire oeuvre ….\\" Notes Works cited :Christie, Janet. \\"Cautionary Tale about a Boy and Girl\\".

Early life Jean-Baptiste Pitois was born May 15, 1811, in Remiremont, France. His family wanted him to become a priest and allowed him to be raised in a monastic community. However, he eventually decided against the priesthood. As a young man, he moved to Paris, where he became the associate of Charles Nodier, one of the leading literary lights of the Romantic movement, which was then emerging on the continent. Nodier's interest in the occult transferred to Pitois. Career Pitois became a journalist and wrote largely under the pen name Paul Christian. He co-wrote Historic Paris: Walks in the Streets of Paris (1837-1840), which was his first book, with Nodier. It was followed by his Studies of the Paris Revolution (1839). That same year he was appointed librarian of the Ministry of Public Education. Working with Nodier through the mass of uncatalogued material opened up a new level of interest in the occult, although it did not manifest for years. Meanwhile, he took his turn in the French army in Algiers from 1843–44 and wrote several historical texts. His most important were the History of the Terrors (1853) and the multi-volume Heroes of Christianity (1853–57). A hint of what was to come appeared in 1844 with his Stories of the Marvelous from All Times and Lands. Pitois had read about occultism and developed a strong anticlerical stance. During his life, many Eastern texts had been translated into French, as had the works of Emanuel Swedenborg. In 1859 Pitois turned his attention to writing Historie de la Magie, du monde Surnaturel et de la fatalité à travers les Temps et les Peuples (1870) (trs: History of Magic, the Supernatural World and Fate, through Times and Peoples). Carefully written so as not to offend his largely Catholic audience, it immediately became popular public reading. It surveyed the whole of the occult, explaining each element, and provided a history of occult practice in the West from ancient times. Death Pitois wrote one additional book, The History of the War with Prussia and of the Two Sieges of Paris, 1870-71 (1872–73). His health declined through the 1870s, and he died at Lyon on July 12, 1877. He left behind a still-unpublished work on astrology that reportedly contains numerous allusions to contemporary events as proof of the value of the horoscope.

Seawalls The highway connecting Sydney to Brisbane was constructed at Narrow Neck in 1920 and by 1921 it became necessary to build the Gold Coast's first seawall out of timber. A series of seawalls were constructed at Narrow Neck over the years including materials like car bodies, old trucks and buses filled with concrete, dumped concrete from old buildings, rocks and boulders. After an evaluation of seawalls along the Gold Coast by Griffith Centre for Coastal Management based at Griffith University on the Gold Coast, the timber wall was upgraded in 2016 by City of Gold Coast using the standard rock seawall design for the Gold Coast. Much of the timber removed was still in good condition. Narrow Neck Artificial Reef A \\"mega sand container\\" at Narrow Neck in 1999. In 1971 the Dutch University Delft completed a report for the Queensland State Government recommending the construction of a groyne at Narrow Neck. The Gold Coast City Council examined the idea of a groyne and instead constructed an artificial reef to stabilise the foreshore at Narrow Neck. So far the reef has worked well as a coastal control point, but has been disappointing in its secondary objective to improve surfing. A surprising benefit of the Narrow Neck Reef has been its ability to attract marine growth and reef fish and is now a popular diving and fishing location. Narrow Neck is particularly popular for kite surfing and longboarding. The 350 × 600 m V-shaped artificial reef is located 200 m offshore and deflects the waves to the left and to the right of its tip. It was built from more than 400 \\"mega sand containers\\" placed between 1 and 10 m below the mean sea level. Each container was about 20 m long and 3.0–4.8 m in diameter; it was filled with up to 250 m3 of sand and weighed up to 500 tonnes. Its walls were made of needle-punched nonwoven geotextile, which offered much higher damage resistance compared to conventional materials. The containers were filled on the shore and installed at a rate of up to 10 per day with a GPS-positioned ship. In June 2018, renewal works were completed in which 84 additional mega sand containers were place on top of the reef from a split hull barge.

Her father was Ahmed Al- Samman, a president of the Syrian University. She was deeply influenced by him since her mother died at a very young age. Career Her father was fond of both Western literature and Arabic literature; this influenced her deeply and gave her a unique style that combines attributes of both. Nevertheless, she soon was confronted with the conservative Damascene society in which she was raised and lived her early years. She published her first book of short stories عيناك قدري “Your Eyes are my Destiny” in 1962 which was received reasonably well. However, she was lumped at the time with other traditional feminine writers. Her later publications took her out of the tight range of feminine and love novels to much wider social, feminist and philosophical extents. She graduated from the Syrian University in 1963 with a BA in English Literature and left to Beirut to earn her master's degree in Theatre from American University of Beirut; since then she had not returned to Damascus. In Beirut she worked in journalism and in 1965 she published her second collection لا بحر في بيروت “No Sea in Beirut” in which the effect of her new, now wider experiences are evident. She then traveled around Europe working as a correspondent and in 1966 published her third collection ليل الغرباء “Foreigners’ Nights” reflecting her experiences. The Six-Day War had a shock effect on her as it did on many of her generation, this was evident in her famous article احمل عاري إلى لندن “I Carry My Shame to London”, after that she did not publish any books for six years but her journalistic articles became closer to the social reality and made her popular. The articles she wrote during that period became the source of some of her later publications. In 1973 she published her fourth collection, رحيل المرافئ القديمة “The Departure of Old Ports”, considered by some critiques one of the most important of her works. In this collection of short stories she described in a literary fashion the dilemma of the Arab intellectual of the time and the conflict between his/her thought and actions. She published her first novel, بيروت 75 “Beirut 75” around the end of 1974. The novel describes the complex social problems in Beirut and started with a prophecy by one of the characters of the novel, a fortune teller that says: “I see blood, I see a lot of blood”. A few months later the civil war broke out in Lebanon. After the publication of two more novels, كوابيس بيروت “Beirut Nightmares\\" in 1977, which describes life in civil-war-torn Beirut in the mid-Seventies, and ليلة المليار “The Eve of Billion” in 1986, she was referred to as the most prominent modern Arab writer by some critics. Life In the late 1960s Ghada married Bashir Al Daouq, the owner of Dar Al Tali’a publishing house and had her only son, Hazim, which she named after one of her heroes in “Foreigners' Nights”. She later made her own publishing house and re-published most of her books, she also gathered all her articles in a series she called الأعمال غير الكاملة “The Unfinished Works”, up to date she has published fifteen books of it, nine of them are poetry collections. She has stored her unpublished works including many letters in a Swiss bank, which she promises to publish “when the time is right”. It is believed that some of her letters may reveal some information about some prominent Palestinian writers and poets during the 1960s, of the people her name was linked with are: Nasir eDdin Al Nashashibi, the journalist and Kamal Nasir, the late poet. In 1993 she caused a scene in the literary and political arenas when she published a collection of love letters written to her by Ghassan Kanafani in the sixties when she had a love affair with him, which was no secret at the time. She was condemned for publishing them by some claiming that her intention was to smear the late writer's reputation and/or to negatively affect the Palestinian Cause. She has also written a few criticism books and translated some of her works to several worldwide languages. Ghada has been living in Paris since the mid-1980s and regularly writes in an Arabic magazine published in London. She refuses any invitations for TV interviews since she had a bad experience when she was interviewed in Cairo and found out that the interviewer had not read any of her works. Ghada Al-Samman's mother died when she was young, so she was raised by her father for most of her life. When she was an adult, Samman's father died and she lost her job in a short period of time. She was left alone in the world. People in her society had a traditional frame of mind and saw her as a “fallen woman” (Vinson 4-6). At that time, she had no father or husband to care for and no family to care for her. This is when Samman became a strong advocate for liberty and self- expression for all people, but especially women. Samman is considered a feminist writer (Wordpress.com p. 3). She does not shy away from subjects seen by the public as taboo. She questions typical thought about women's sexuality and the freedoms enjoyed by the upper class (Vinson 9-10). Samman has as many critics as she has fans, but she takes the comments in stride and continues to write about beliefs and view points that most writers refuse to touch through her works of fiction. A large part of Ghada Al-Samman's identity is an able, determined woman and she intends to make anyone who will listen feel the same way.

The race is held in memory of Italian cyclist Ugo Agostoni, winner of prestigious classic Milan–San Remo, killed during World War II. It is also called Giro della Brianza. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour.
