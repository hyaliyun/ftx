Martinique is an overseas department of France located in the Windward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. The avifauna of Martinique included a total of 210 species according to Bird Checklists of the World as of May 2020. Of them, 10 have been introduced by humans and 132 are rare or accidental. One existing species is endemic and one species has been extirpated. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. French names in parentheses are also from the Check-list. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The tags and notes on population status are also from Bird Checklists of the World. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Martinique * (I) Introduced - a species introduced directly to Martinique or elsewhere in the New World Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

She received the O. Henry Award, a Benjamin Franklin magazine award, and the Henry H. Bellaman Foundation Award for fiction. Early life and education Nancy Hale was born in Boston on May 6, 1908. Her parents, Philip Leslie Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale were both painters, and her father was the son of famed speaker and Unitarian minister Edward Everett Hale. Nancy Hale began writing at an early age, producing a family newspaper, the Society Cat, at age eight, and publishing her first story, \\"The Key Glorious,\\" in the Boston Herald, at age eleven. She also devoted considerable energy to the study of art under her parents' tutelage. She graduated from the Winsor School in 1926 and studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and under her father at the Fenway Studios.  Career  = Early career = In 1928, Hale moved to New York City with her first husband, where she was hired to work in the art department at Vogue. She was, however, almost immediately put to work as an assistant editor and writer instead. Under the pen name Anne Leslie, she wrote \\"chatty news\\" items, fashion news, and editorials. She began writing as a freelancer as well, providing articles and short stories to Scribner's, Harper's, The American Mercury, and Vanity Fair. Her first piece for The New Yorker was published in 1929.Her first novel, The Young Die Good, was published by Scribner's in 1932. Her editor, Maxwell Perkins, called it \\"a trifle\\" about Manhattan life but said that \\"she meant it to be.\\" In 1933, one of her stories,\\"To the Invader,\\" won the O. Henry Memorial Award Prize. Her second novel, Never Any More, published in 1934, was about the antagonism of three girls whose mothers are friends. Hale was hired by the New York Times as its first woman straight news reporter in the spring of 1934, a job which she left after an exhausting six months. In 1935, she published her first collection of short stories, The Earliest Dreams. = Life in Charlottesville = Hale settled in Charlottesville, VA, in 1936 with her second husband. In 1942, Hale published her best-selling book, The Prodigal Women, also about three women‚Äîtwo sisters from the South and their friend from New England. Reviewing the book in the New York Times, Orville Prescott wrote, \\"Nancy Hale's clever short stories long have been one of the star attractions in The New Yorker\\" and that her \\"knowledge of the inner workings of her fellow- women's minds is almost appalling.\\" At over 700 pages, it was by far her longest work, and its publication followed by the longest interruption to Hale's writing career, resulting from an emotional breakdown. She would later publish a collection of stories, Heaven and Hardpan Farm (1957), based in part on her experience of recovery and psychiatric treatment. In 1951, she published her fourth novel, The Sign of Jonah, about a Vermont girl's married life in Virginia, and in 1955, her third collection of short stories, The Empress's Ring. Most of the stories in this collection, as well as those in The Pattern of Perfection (1961) and the semi-autobiographical pieces in A New England Girlhood (1958), were published in The New Yorker. She once claimed to have sold the magazine a record number of stories in one year (12) and eventually published over 80, placing her among The New Yorker's most prolific fiction authors. During this period, she also wrote two plays, \\"The Best of Everything\\" (1952) and \\"Somewhere She Dances\\" (1953), which were produced at the University of Virginia's Minor Hall Theatre. She also delivered a series of lectures at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in 1959 and 1960 that she later published in The Realities of Fiction (1963). Her fifth novel, Black Summer (1963), recounted the experiences of a child sent to live with strict Christian relatives. Reviewing the book in the New York Times, Beverly Grunwald wrote that Hale \\"has taken a 7-year-old boy and penetrated truly and conscientiously into his mind and spirit.\\" Her last, Secrets (1968), was described as a \\"semi-fictional memoir\\" in the New York Times and categorized as young adult fiction by The Saturday Review. In 1969, she published The Life in the Studio, a collection of autobiographical pieces, first published in The New Yorker, inspired by having to clear out her parents' studios after her mother's death. May Sarton wrote of the book, \\"The singular charm of Nancy Hale's memories of her artist mother and father and their circle is that we see them as in a double mirror ... the discerning eye of the adult writer is always present, but at the same time we are immersed in and captured by this private world of artists, as it was.\\" When she followed this in 1975 with a biography of the painter Mary Cassatt, however, the Times' art critic, John Russell wrote that, \\"The fact that Miss Hale comes of a family of painters and has published a number of novels must be said to have given her delusions of competence both as to the nature of art and as to the motivation of complex and altogether exceptional human beings.\\" She and a fellow writer, Elizabeth Coles Langhorne, founded the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts in 1971. Hale argued that, \\"if Virginia really wanted to further the arts, it could do so easily, moreover cheaply, by purchasing an abandoned motel and staffing it for writers to write in‚Äîfeeding them and seeing that they were uninterrupted.\\" Norah Lind has written of Hale that, \\"... despite any claims she made to the contrary, her work is largely autobiographical. She writes of her remarkable artistic family, successful career years, troubled marriages, and emotional breakdowns. The author is present in the characters who fill her narratives‚Äîoften youthful and lovely women from privileged social backgrounds.\\"  Personal life  In 1928, she married aspiring writer Taylor Scott Hardin and moved with him to New York City. Their first son, Mark Hardin, was born in 1930. By 1934, the pair had divorced. In 1935, she married the journalist, Charles Wertenbaker and, in 1936, moved with him to Charlottesville, Virginia. She and Wertenbaker had a son, named William, in 1938, but the couple divorced in 1941. In 1942, Hale married Fredson Bowers, a professor of English at the University of Virginia, and the couple stayed together until Hale's death over 45 years later. After publishing The Prodigal Women, Hale was plagued by a series of physical ailments and bouts of anxiety severe enough to result in 1938 and again in 1943 in what was called a \\"nervous breakdown.\\" Always intensely self-critical, Hale worried that she had squandered a promising career and sold- out artistically by writing to make money. She was fortunate in 1943 to find a psychoanalyst, Beatrice Hinkle, who helped her begin to solve what Hale called \\"this problem of who to be.\\"  Death  Hale died on September 24, 1988 at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville.

It is one of the most common saturation mutagenesis techniques. In four PCR- based reaction steps, phosphorothioate nucleotides are inserted in the gene sequence, cleaved and the resulting fragments elongated by universal or degenerate nucleotides. These nucleotides are then replaced by standard nucleotides, allowing for a broad distribution of nucleic acid mutations spread over the gene sequence with a preference to transversions and with a unique focus on consecutive point mutations, both difficult to generate by other mutagenesis techniques. The technique was developed by Professor Ulrich Schwaneberg at Jacobs University Bremen and RWTH Aachen University.  Technology, development and advantages  SeSaM has been developed in order to overcome several of the major limitations encountered when working with standard mutagenesis methods based on simple error-prone PCR (epPCR) techniques. These epPCR techniques rely on the use of polymerases and thus encounter limitations which mainly result from the circumstance that only single, but very rarely consecutive, nucleic acid substitutions are performed and that these substitutions occur usually at specific, favored positions only. In addition, transversions of nucleic acids are much less likely than transitions and require specifically designed polymerases with an altered bias. These characteristics of epPCR catalyzed nucleic acid exchanges together with the fact that the genetic code is degenerated decrease the resulting diversity on the amino acid level. Synonymous substitutions lead to amino acid preservation or conservative mutations with similar physico-chemical properties such as size and hydrophobicity are strongly prevalent. By non- specific introduction of universal bases at every position in the gene sequence, SeSaM overcomes the polymerase bias favoring transitory substitutions at specific positions but opens the complete gene sequence to a diverse array of amino acid exchanges. Comparison of the amino acid substitution pattern obtainable using standard epPCR methods (single nucleotide substitutions with transition bias) and the Sequence saturation mutagenesis method (introducing consecutive nucleotide substitutions with an increased ratio of transversions).During the development of the SeSaM-method, several modifications were introduced that allowed for the introduction of several mutations simultaneously. Another advancement of the method was achieved by introduction of degenerate bases instead of universal inosine and the use of optimized DNA polymerases, further increasing the ratio of introduced transversions. This modified SeSaM-TV+ method in addition allows for and favors the introduction of two consecutive nucleotide exchanges, broadening strongly the spectrum of amino acids that may be substituted. By several optimizations including the application of an improved chimera polymerase in Step III of the SeSaM-TV-II method and the addition of an alternative degenerate nucleotide for efficient substitution of thymine and cytosine bases and increased mutation frequency in SeSaM-P/R, generated libraries were further improved with regard to transversion number and the number of consecutive mutations was raised to 2‚Äì4 consecutive mutations with a rate of consecutive mutations of up to 30%.  Procedure  The SeSaM-method consists of four PCR-based steps which can be executed within two to three days. Major parts include the incorporation of phosphorothioate nucleotides, the chemical fragmentation at these positions, the introduction of universal or degenerate bases and their replacement by natural nucleotides inserting point mutations. Experimental steps for generation of a non-biased random mutagenesis library using the sequence saturation mutagenesis method. Initially, universal ‚ÄúSeSaM‚Äù-sequences are inserted by PCR with gene-specific primers binding in front of and behind the gene of interest. The gene of interest with its flanking regions is amplified to introduce these SeSaM_fwd and SeSaM_rev sequences and to generate template for consecutive PCR steps. These generated so-called fwd template and rev templates are now amplified in a PCR reaction with a pre-defined mixture of phosphorothioate and standard nucleotides to ensure an even distribution of inserted mutations over the full length of the gene. PCR products of Step 1 are cleaved specifically at the phosphorothioate bonds, generating a pool of single-stranded DNA fragments of different lengths starting from the universal primer. In Step 2 of SeSaM, the DNA single strands are elongated by one to several universal or degenerate bases (depending on the modification of SeSaM applied) catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). This step is the key step to introduce the characteristic consecutive mutations to randomly mutate entire codons. Subsequently, in Step 3 a PCR is performed recombining the single stranded DNA fragments with the corresponding full-length reverse template, generating the full-length double stranded gene including universal or degenerate bases in its sequence. By replacement of the universal/degenerate bases in the gene sequence by random standard nucleotides in SeSaM Step 4, a diverse array of full-length gene sequences with substitution mutations is generated, including a high load of transversions and subsequent substitution mutations.  Applications  SeSaM is used to directly optimize proteins on amino acid level, but also to preliminarily identify amino acid positions to test in saturation mutagenesis for the ideal amino acid exchange. SeSaM has been successfully applied in numerous directed evolution campaigns of different classes of enzymes for their improvement towards selected properties such as cellulase for ionic liquid resistance, protease with increased detergent tolerance, glucose oxidase for analytical application, phytase with increased thermostability and monooxygenase with improved catalytic efficiency using alternative electron donors. SeSaM is patent protected by US770374 B2 in over 13 countries and is one of the platform technologies of SeSaM-Biotech GmbH.

He wrote a number of books, including an early account of the Malay Peninsula that is a source of information on the region of that period. In the early 17th century, he became interested in exploring a \\"southern land\\", which is thought to be Australia. Life Godinho de Er√©dia was the youngest of four children of Jo√£o de Er√©dia Aquaviva, a Portuguese of Aragonese and Italian descent. His mother was Dona Elena Vessiva from Sulawesi, a Makassar or a Bugis described as a princess, the daughter of the King of Supa. His father was part of a Portuguese missionary expedition to Sulawesi when he met the 15-year-old girl, who fell in love and eloped with the Portuguese captain, and they married in 1545. Manuel Godinho de Er√©dia was born on 16 July 1563 in Malacca where he also spent his childhood. He was educated at a Jesuit school there. His mother died in 1575, and soon after when he was 13, Er√©dia was sent to a Jesuit college in Goa where was trained in astronomy, cartography and mathematics. He was received into Company of Jesus in 1579, but left to work for the Portuguese government in Goa in 1580 as his Superiors felt it would better suit his interest in exploration. Er√©dia married Vilante de Sampaio in Cochin in around 1586. They had two children: a daughter born in 1587 and a son in 1588. Career \\"Construction of Malacca City: Intramuros Anno 1604\\" by Godinho de Eredia. Er√©dia worked as a cosmographer, wrote books, and taught mathematics. He also served as a soldier and military engineer. He prepared new maps of Asian countries for the King of Spain. The King was said to have named Eredia as the discoverer of Meridional India (a supposed southern land) on 14 February 1594, and he was also said to have given the title of \\"Adelantado\\" (Governor General) and made a member of the Order of Christ. There is however no proof of these claims. Er√©dia became interested in finding the legendary \\"land of gold\\", and returned to South East Asia in 1600 on a mission to explore further the Indonesian Archipelago. However, he had to stay in Malacca for four years, commanding a fleet of 70 ships guarding the southern approach to the Malacca. He founded a fort in Muar in 1604, and captured Kota Batu, the capital of Johore, with General Andre Furtado de Mendo√ßa. Map by Godinho de Er√©dia showing Java and possibly Australia (marked as Nuca Antara) Er√©dia heard of a land to the south or Luca Antara (which may be Australia) in 1601 and was interested in exploring it, but fell ill in 1605 and had to return to Goa.

These materials combine the entropy elasticity of an elastomer with the self-organization of the liquid crystalline phase. In liquid crystalline elastomers, the mesogens can either be part of the polymer chain (main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers) or they are attached via an alkyl spacer (side-chain liquid crystalline elastomers). Due to their actuation properties, liquid crystalline elastomers are attractive candidates for the use as artificial muscles in soft or microrobots. These were already predicted by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes in 1975 and first synthesized by Heino Finkelmann.P. G. de Gennes: C. R. Hebd. Seances Acad. Sci., Ser. B (1975). S. 101. In the temperature range of the liquid crystalline phase, the mesogen's orientation forces the polymer chains into a stretched conformation. By heating the sample above the clearing temperature this orientation is lost and the polymer backbone can relax into (the more favored) random coil conformation which can lead to a macroscopic, reversible deformation. For good actuation, it is necessary to have a good alignment of the domains' directors before cross-linking. This can be achieved by: stretching of the prepolymerized sample,G.H.F. Bergmann, H. Finkelmann, V. Percec and M. Y. Zhao: Macromol. Chem. Phys. (1994). S. 353. photo-alignment layers,T. H. Ware, Z. P. Perry, C. M. Middleton, S. T. Iacono, T. J. White: ACS Macro Letters (2015).

Beside the thermal deformation of a sample, a light-responsive actuation can be obtained for samples with azobenzenes being incorporated in the liquid crystalline phase.T. Ube, T. Ikeda: Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (2014). S. 10290. The phase transition temperature of an azo-liquid crystalline elastomer can be reduced due to the trans-cis isomerization of the azobenzenes during UV-irradiation and thus the liquid crystalline phase can be destroyed isothermally. For liquid crystalline elastomers with a high azo-concentration, a light- responsive change of the sample's length of up to 40% could be observed.L.B. Braun, T. Hessberger, R. Zentel: J. Mater. Chem.

These games originated in the era of the Sukhothai Kingdom (1238-1438). Hundreds of years later, during the reign of Rama VI, the games grew popular again among Thai children. The original purpose of Thai traditional games was to form good relationships between adults and young people. They were also used as entertainment, relaxation, and exercise. Thai traditional games are played with songs and rules to make them more entertaining. Most traditional Thai games use natural, found items, like children's games everywhere. For example, sand, mud balls, and the stems of the banana trees were common components of games. Khee ma kan kuay (horse riding) 250x250px * Equipment: One metre-long banana stalk, knife, rope * Number of players: More than two persons * How to play: All players sit on the banana stalk like they're riding a horse and shout \\"hee hee\\" or \\"yee haaah\\". All of them have to run to the goal at the end of the racecourse. Whoever reaches the finish line first is the winner. Dern Ka La * Equipment: two coconut shells and rope or string (1.5 m) * Number of players: More than two persons * How to play: Each player stands on a coconut shell and holds the string. After standing on the coconut shell, they will start the game by walking. They have to walk as quickly as possible and whoever arrives at the finish line first is the winner. Mon Sonpa or Mon hides a cloth * Equipment: Cloth * Number of players: More than three persons * How to play: Before starting the game, players have to choose the person who will be \\"Mon\\" and then every player except the Mon will sit down on the floor in circle and sing the song \\"Son Pha\\". While all the other players sing, Mon will hold a cloth and walk around the circle. If Mon puts a cloth behind one of them, he or she must pick it up and run to catch the Mon around the circle. If the player cannot catch the Mon before the Mon sits at his or her place, the one who holds that cloth will be the next Mon for the next game.

One of the marine ecosystems found in the Virgin Islands are the coral reefs. These coral reefs can be located between the islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John. These coral reefs have an area of 297.9 km2, along with other marine habitats that are in between.Catanzaro, Don, Rick Nemeth, Caroline Rogers, Zandy Hillis-Starr, and Marcia Taylor, \\"The Status of the Coral Reefs of The U.S. Virgin Islands\\" The way these coral reefs grow are by coral larvae swimming freely and attaching themselves to hard surfaces around the islands and start to develop a skeleton on the outside of their skin to protect themselves from predators but also allow a new place for other coral larvae to attach to and grow on.\\"How Coral Reefs Grow\\" Coral Reef Alliance. These corals can form into three different structures; fringing reefs, which are reefs that are close to the shore, barrier reefs, which are reefs that are alongside the shore and is separated by deep water, and an atoll reef which is a coral reef that circles a lagoon or body of water.\\"Corals\\" NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Corals.  Distribution  As stated, the coral reefs such as fringing reefs, deep reefs, patch reefs and spur and groove formation are distributed over three islands in the Virgin Islands which are St. Croix (Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve, Buck Island Reef National Monument), St. Thomas, and St. John (Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument). The coral reefs found offshore of St. Thomas and St. John are distributed patchily around the islands. Additionally, a developed barrier reef system surrounds St. Croix along its eastern and southern shores.Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas.  Ecology  The coral reefs as well as hard-bottom habitat accounts for 297.9 km2. The coral reefs are home to diverse species. There are over 40 species of scleractinian corals and three species of Millepora.Caldow, Chris, Barry Devine, Peter Edmunds et al. \\"Ecology of Coral Reefs in the US Virgin Islands\\" (2008) Live scleractinian species are found throughout the Virgin Islands, but mainly around Buck Island, St. Croix and St. John. More specifically based on a survey from 2001-2006, listed are a total of 215 fishes from St. John and 202 from St. Croix. Four species of sea turtles are found within the Virgin Islands. The coral reefs are impacted by freshwater environments from the Amazon and Orinoco River in the form of anticyclonic rings which are rich in nutrients.  Hazards  This marine environment has been degraded in a variety of ways. One of the ways in which the corals have been affected is by the dust from Africa. This dust might be affected the corals by causing degradation. Apart from the dust, the corals also experience a few diseases. There is black-band disease which infects major coral reefs such as Montastraea annularis. The most severe diseases are the white-band and white plague disease. The branching acroporid have been influenced the most. Corals picture taken from Brewers Bay on St. Thomas Other than the few diseases listed, other ways in which the corals have been affected are by natural disasters such as hurricanes, human influence such as fishing and pollution, and global warming. The Coral reefs are also being degraded by many other factors: * Natural Disasters: coral reefs experience natural disturbance events that can affect and dramatically altered the reef ecosystem. Disasters include hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis. * Tourism: The United States Virgin Islands are a popular tourist destination with over two million cruise ship passenger arrivals per year. Tourism generates vast amounts of income for USVI, however, tourism pressures can cause physical damage to the coral reefs. For example, recreation activities (scuba diving and snorkeling), disposal of untreated sewage and poorly placed boat anchors by cruise ships. * Coastal development: tourism leads to construction projects such as building of hotels and restaurants, coral reefs habitats are destroyed or disturbed by dredging activities and nutrients and sediment run-off. * Pollution: Pollution from human activities is damaging reefs. Humans dispose unwanted items on beaches, in the sea or near water pathways. * Overfishing and destructive fishing methods: the coral reefs have been heavily fished due to increasing demand for food. Overfishing of important reef species negatively impact the coral reefs‚Äô biodiversity and ecological. Additionally, some destructive means of fishing are used on coral reefs including dynamite and cyanide. These practices often kill fishes and destroy fragile coral reefs. Degrading the coral reef habitat on which the fishes rely on will in turn reduce the productivity of the area.

Bot. 49(12): 2203-2213 She was a mycologist at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, with Canada‚Äôs federal department of agriculture (now Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada). Her influence on Canadian mycology and her concern with public education are recognized in the Canadian Botanical Association‚Äôs annual Luella K. Weresub lecture in Mycology and the Weresub Prize awarded for the best student paper published by a Canadian student in mycology.  Biography  Weresub was a scholar, rights defender and survivor. She was born 29 March 1918 in Zolotonosha, Russia (now part of Ukraine), at the end of World War I (during the Russian Revolution) to Jewish parents, Marcus (Mendel) Weresub and Clara (n√©e Rabinovitch) Weresub. They emigrated to Canada in 1923 during a period of increasing antisemitism following the Ukrainian War of Independence. They first settled in Hubbard, Saskatchewan. Luella was originally transcribed as \\"Louella\\" and \\"Kayla\\" as \\"Keila\\", and friends occasionally wrote \\"Dear Lou\\" or \\"Lu\\". She attended a two-room school with her older sister, Matilda, in Regina at age 5, refusing to be separated from her sister, and later attending school in Winnipeg. She quickly learned to speak English and by the end of the year was top in her class. At age 16 she won a scholarship for studies in Latin and another national scholarship (Watson Scholarship) to Queen's University, but had to defer her studies due to her sister‚Äôs appendicitis that occurred in transit in 1935 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Her scholarship was deferred for one year while she worked. She attended Queen's University in 1936‚Äì37, but her studies were further delayed by family financial issues (during the 1930s Great Depression). She worked at her father's store in Arntfield, Quebec (1937‚Äì38), that eventually went bankrupt. She returned to Sault Ste. Marie to work at radio station CJIC (1940‚Äì41) and then radio station CHML (1941‚Äì47) in Hamilton, Ontario. One of her programs, Sewing School of the Air, which promoted sewing to save money during the Second World War, was advertised in 1942 in Broadcasting, The Weekly Magazine of Radio under the name \\"Louella Weresub\\".Broadcasting. The Weekly Magazine of Radio, Vol. 22 [18] p. 38. May 4, 1942 - http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1942/1942-05-04-BC.pdf). She re- entered Queen‚Äôs University in 1947 and earned her B.A. in Biology in 1950. During her four years attending Queen‚Äôs she was awarded the University Scholarship, W.W Near Scholarship in Biology, Queen‚Äôs Medal in Biology, and Arts Research Travelling Fellowship. During the summer of 1950 she worked for the Defense Research Board (National Research Council) in Kingston, Ontario, as arranged by Prof. Herbert S. Jackson, a mycologist and head of the Botany Department at the University of Toronto. Her research on corticioid fungi began under mentorship by Jackson at the University of Toronto, but he died suddenly in December 1951. She finished her M.A. with Prof. Roy F. Cain in 1952. Further employment with the Government of Canada in 1952 was derailed and then deferred by the political climate of the day in North America, now termed McCarthyism. Consequently, she became a lecturer at the Department of Botany of the University of Manitoba for three years, and was greatly supported and assisted by Prof. D. L. Bailey of the University of Toronto and Dr. J. Walton Groves with the mycology unit in Ottawa who wished to employ her in 1952. She returned to the University of Toronto in 1955 and completed her Ph.D in 2 years (1957), evidently accumulating credit for research while at the University of Manitoba. She finally joined the mycology unit of the Department of Agriculture in Ottawa on May 21, 1957. She was employed there until her death on 30 October 1979 from complications of pneumonia following an operation for lung cancer. She is buried in the Jewish Memorial Cemetery in Osgoode, Ontario.  Career in mycology  Her list of formal research papers is relatively modest but influential. Both her MA and PhD theses were on the corticioid genus Peniophora sect. Tubuliferae (now Tubulicrinis), as were her early publications. She went on to develop expertise on other corticioid fungi. Well ahead of modern phylogenetic analyses, she and Bryce Kendrick published an exploratory paper on numerical taxonomy, \\"Attempting Neo- Adansonian computer taxonomy at the ordinal level in Basidiomycetes\\", in 1966. Her studies on corticioid fungi led her to investigated sclerotium-producing Basidiomycetes, first among the corticioid fungi and then among other groups such as Typhula. She whimiscally and imaginatively named the fungus genus Minimedusa because of its \\"medusoid\\" (like the mythical decapitated Medusa‚Äôs head) tangled hyphae forming the bulbil. Her work involved major taxonomic revisions and studies on applied pathology problems. Her last two publications were printed posthumously, one on the apple rot fungus Corticium centrifugum and the other on nomenclature with John McNeill, who had learned his nomenclature along with her and would become senior editor of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. Notably, much of her time went into uncompromising reviews of manuscripts and theses. She picked her way through botanical nomenclature and spent countless hours helping others with nomenclatural problems. Luella worked to make the International Botanical Code of Nomenclature (now the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants) more easily understood, less equivocal, more comprehensive, and hence more useful. As a world authority on botanical nomenclature, especially as it applies to fungi, she was an active member of the Nomenclature Committee of the Mycological Society of America, of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy's Nomenclature Committee for Fungi and Lichens, and of the International Mycological Association's Nomenclature Secretariat. She was the chair of the Subcommittee on Article 59‚Äîon naming of pleomorphic fungi‚Äîand contributed substantially to international discussion on starting point dates for fungi and on palaeomycological nomenclature. Among other accomplishments, she helped coin the terms \\"anamorph\\" and \\"teleomorph\\". Weresub was a very active member of the Canadian Botanical Association/Association Botanical du Canada, serving as a Director from 1971 to 1973. She participated in nomenclature sessions of Botanical Congresses at Edinburgh, Montreal, and Seattle as well as the mycological Congresses at Exeter and Tampa. Honours and awards The Canadian Botanical Association/Association Botanical du Canada has established an award in her honour. The University of Toronto Department of Botany also established the L.W.

In 1880 the St. Joseph Lead Company laid the track a long narrow gauge railroad with a gauge of .Labelled Models, Manuals: Mississippi River and Bonne Terre Railway. It was inaugurated on 18 January 1880 and became known as the St. Joseph & Des Loge Railway.George Woodman Hilton: American Narrow Gauge Railroads. Stanford University Press, 1990. It was used to transport goods westerly from Bonne Terre to Summit, a point on the line of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Company, but the mine products of the St. Joseph Lead Company had still to be hauled for by ox-team from the mines to Bonne Terre. The narrow-gauge line was apparently jointly owned by the St. Joseph Lead Company and the Desloge Company. It was removed after the M.R. & B.T.'s property was placed in service. The cost was split between both companies: The St. Joe paid 66% and the Desloge Company paid 33%. The St. Joe Lead Company acquired in 1887 the assets of the Desloge Lead Company, and tried to find a shorter route, to reduce the transportation cost.Christopher Desloge: Desloge Chronicles ‚Äì A Tale of Two Continents ‚Äì An Amazing Family's Journey ‚Äì Volume One. 2013. = M.R. & B.T. = M.R. & B.T. Caboose No 3 The M.R. & B.T. was incorporated for a term of 50 years on May 11, 1888, under the provisions of Chapter 21, Articles 1 and 2, of the revised statutes of Missouri. The incorporators were nominees of the St. Joseph Lead Company. The avowed purpose of the corporation was to construct, operate, and maintain a standard or broad gauge railroad, extending in a northerly direction from Bonne Terre, St. Francois County, through St. Francois and Jefferson Counties, in Missouri, to a point on the Mississippi River now known as Riverside. The proposed line was long, and the authorized capital stock had the value of $10,000 per mile, or $300,000. The railway was initially constructed as a narrow gauge railroad between Bonne Terre and Riverside, a wharf at the Mississippi River. The first section was inaugurated in 1890 and the Summit Railroad was subsequently abandoned. In 1894 the gauge of the railroad was re-gauged to standard gauge and later the track was expanded from Bonne Terre to Doe Run. It crossed the Belmont Branch of the Iron Mountain Railway at Doe Run Junction. Big River, 11 a.m. train, Desloge, Missouri The main line of the Mississippi River and Bonne Terre Railroad was, after completion, only long, but it proved to be beneficial for the development of the Lead Belt, since there was a lot of traffic on the railroad. It was built similar to most trunk lines. A branch line was laid to Leadwood and there were several miles of feeders, turn-offs and sidings. The railroad ran through the growing towns of Bonne Terre, Desloge, St. Francois, Flat River, Rivermines, Elvins and Doe Run, whose economy benefited from the improved transport capabilities. The inclines were below 1.8% and the curves had radii of . The rail weights ranged between 75‚Äì90 lb/yard (37.5‚Äì45 kg/metre) similar to most trunk lines. Even so, the order for two Baldwin 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives included the following caution: \\"Engine frames to be extra heavy throughout. Engine frames to be designed to withstand rough usage and considerable lateral thrust, which will be continually in evidence given that the road is all curves, there being only one tangent [straight track] which is a mile long.\\"Steve Llanso: Mississippi River & Bonne Terre 4-6-2 \\"Pacific\\" Locomotives of the USA. The following amendments to the original charter have been filed: * On May 1, 1891, to change the style of construction of the road from standard to narrow gauge, and on November 4, 1893, to change it back from narrow to standard gauge. * On May 1, 1891, to extend the line from its then southern terminus at Bonne Terre Depot in Bonne Terre to Doe Run, about , and on June 21, 1895, to make a further extension of about , southerly from Doe Run to a point in Madison County, Mo.. * On May 1, 1891, to increase the authorized capital stock to $500,000; on June 21, 1895, to $600,000; on September 14, 1903, to $2,500,000; and on August 3, 1911, to $3,000,000, which is the amount of capital stock authorized on June 30, 1914, the date of an ICC valuation. M.R. & B.T. Station, Bonne Terre, MO The M.R.& B.T.'s main line from Riverside to Bonne Terre, , was constructed for it by the St. Joseph Lead Company during 1889 and 1890. It was placed in regular service on March 10, 1890. The extension of the main line from Bonne Terre to Doe Run Junction, , was also built by the St. Joseph Lead Company for the M.R. & B.T. It was placed in service in June, 1892. The southerly end of the main stem, extending from Doe Run Junction to Doe Run, , was built, during 1892, by the Doe Run Lead Company, a subsidiary of the St. Joseph Lead Company. It was operated by the M.R. & B.T. under lease until September, 1893, when it was purchased outright. The foregoing of line were originally built as narrow gauge, but was changed to standard gauge in 1893‚Äì1894. The four branch lines, embracing , were constructed as standard gauge as follows: *Turpin branch, Doe Run to Turpin, was built by the M.R. & B.T. in 1895-6: *Hoffman branch, Hoffman Junction to Big River, , was built by the M.R. & B.T. in 1899, and extension from Big River to end of track, , built by the M.R. & B.T. in 1902: *Gumbo branch, from River Mines to Mitchell Junction, , was built by the St. Joseph Lead Company in 1898 and was purchased by the M.R. & B.T. in 1901; the extension from Mitchell Junction to the end of track, , was built by the M.R. & B.T. in 1906 *Crawley branch, from Flat River to milepost , was constructed by the St. Joseph Lead Company in 1893 and was purchased by the M.R. & B.T. in 1901; from milepost 1.03 to Columbia Mill, 0.731 mile was constructed by the Doe Run Lead Company in 1900‚Äì1901 and was acquired by the M.R. & B.T. in 1908. The extension of from Columbia Mill to end of track was built by the Columbia Lead Company in 1897, and was acquired by the M.R. & B.T. from the Doe Run Lead Company in 1908: = Aftermath = The Missouri Pacific acquired the M.R. & B.T. in 1929 and merged it with the Missouri-Illinois Railroad, which operated it as an independent subsidiary until 1945. In 1938 a gasoline passenger train operated and made two round trips per day. The Missouri Pacific Railway subsequently acquired 51% of the Missouri‚ÄìIllinois Railroad, with which it merged in 1978. The section from Derby at the junction with the Missouri-Illinois Railway to Doe Run ceased operations in 1941. The section from Howe to Bonne including the tunnel were disused in 1969. The two sections up north and south of Bonne Terre were still in use in the late 1980s.

The youngest of the three children of Gaspard II de Coligny and Charlotte de Laval, he became marquis of Coligny-le-Vieux, Andelot and Saint-Bris, baron of Lanty and lord of Dinteville, Dannemarie, Auxon and Cusey. He was the only one of Gaspard and Charlotte's children to be baptized a Protestant and the only one to convert to Roman Catholicism. Life He was captured after the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre and imprisoned in Marseille until freed in May 1576. He then fought for the King of Navarre alongside his brother in the Rouerge and Languedoc. In August 1577 he and his brother recaptured the town of Mauguio and Charles was left behind to garrison it. In June 1585 he raised an infantry regiment and led it on campaign in Languedoc until 1587 as part of the duke of Montmorency's force. He fought alongside Lesdigui√®res in summer 1587 in the Dauphin√©, Savoy and Vivarais. He was captured again in July 1590 during the siege of Paris, before switching to the Catholic League and converting to Roman Catholicism. He based himself in Lyon and was imprisoned for a time at Pierre Scize on the orders of the duke of Nemours in 1593. In 1596 he became a gentleman in ordinary to Henry IV of France. In 1598 he was made a mar√©chal de camp, in 1604 governor of Langres and in 1608 lieutenant general to the government of Champagne - he gave up the lieutenancy generalship in 1615 in favour of his eldest son. From 1615 to 1616 he was put in command of a small force sent against the rebel princes such as Luxembourg in the Champagne - commanding 2,500 infantry and 600 cavalry he besieged Varennes and Soyeras in Bassigny then Brienne and Rosnay. In 1617 he was made freeholder of Coligny- le-Vieil and Andelot by Archduke Albert. Coligny-le-Vieux and Andelot were promoted into marquisates in his favour, but in 1629 he sold them both to his cousin Cl√©riadus de Coligny. On 31 December 1619 he was made a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit and the Order of Saint Michael. Marriage and issue He married Humberte or Huberte de Chastenay, lady of Lanty and Dinteville. = Joachim Fran√ßois = Joachim-Fran√ßois, marquis d‚ÄôAndelot, mestre-de-camp to a 1200 strong infantry regiment and his father's successor as lieutenant governor of Champagne (1615). He campaigned in Italy and in 1623 presented himself to Monsieur de B√©rulle for reception into the Oratorian order in Paris. He was ordained a priest by S√©bastien Zamet, bishop of Langres, in February 1625. He became head of the new Company of the Holy Sacrament in 1631 and founded a 'carmel' at Chaumont-en-Bassigny as well as making many gifts to Ch√¢tillon. After his brother's death he retired to Lanty and fell sick in 1654. He moved to Ch√¢tillon and made his will before dying on 18 October 1654 - after receiving the last rites he cried out \\"I die a child of the Catholic, Apostolic and Roman Church\\". His body was buried in the castle church at Ch√¢tillon and his heart in Lenty. = Bernard = Born in 1605, he owed his name to his recovery from illness aged six months on 7 February 1609, after his father prayed for the intercession of saint Bernard of Clairvaux. He became marquis of Coligny-le-Vieux, Andelot and Saint-Bris, baron of Lanty and Dinteville and lieutenant-g√©n√©ral of Champagne. In 1625 he married Gabrielle de Pouilly, daughter of Simon de Pouilly, baron of Esne and Manonville, lord of Loupy, marshal of Barrois, governor of Stenay, and his wife Fran√ßoise de Berniaut.

The type species, Caelestiventus hanseni, honors Robin Hansen, the Bureau of Land Management geologist (BLM), who facilitated access to the excavation site. Caelestiventus is important because it is the sole example of a desert- dwelling non-pterodactyloid pterosaur and is 65 million years older than other known desert-dwelling pterosaurs. Additionally, it shows that even the earliest pterosaurs were morphologically and ecologically diverse and that the Dimorphodontidae originated in the Triassic Period. Discovery Caelestiventus was recovered from the Saints & Sinners Quarry of northeastern Utah. The site was discovered in 2007 by Dan Chure and George Engelmann while working on the geology and paleontology of the fossilized dunes of the Nugget Sandstone. In 2015 the discovery of Caelestiventus was reported in the scientific literature.Britt, B.B., Chure, D.J., Engelmann, G.F., Dalla Vecchia, F., Scheetz, R., Meek, S., Thelin, C., and Chambers, M., 2015, \\"A new, large, non-pterodactyloid pterosaur from a Late Triassic interdunal desert environment within the eolian Nugget Sandstone of northeastern Utah, USA, indicates early pterosaurs were ecologically diverse and geographically widespread\\", Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Program with Abstracts, p. 97Britt, B.B., Dalla Vecchia, F.M., Chure, D.J., Engelmann, G.F., Chambers, M.A, Thelin, C., Scheetz, R., 2015, \\"New Triassic pterosaur from interdunal desert deposits of the Nugget Sandstone NE Utah, USA\\", Flugsaurier 2015, 5th International Symposium on Pterosaurs, Portsmouth, England, Program with Abstracts, p. 17‚Äì18 Description Restoration Most Triassic pterosaurs are small. Caelestiventus, however, is one of the largest (if not the largest) known Triassic pterosaurs, with a wingspan of at least and a skull long (based on a complete mandible).These measurements are based on the only known specimen, which had not yet reached full maturity at the time of its death; a full-grown Caelestiventus would have been even larger. Unlike most Triassic pterosaur fossils which are often severely crushed, the bones of Caelestiventus are three-dimensional and relatively intact. This preservation provides insights into the delicate structures of skull bones, including pneumatic features such as foramina/fossae and internal chambers. Caelestiventus is known from a single individual (BYU 20707, in the Museum of Paleontology at Brigham Young University) that preserves much of the skull (skull cap, sides of the face, and a complete lower jaw (mandible) along with a single non-skull bone ‚Äì the last finger bone at the end of the elongated fourth finger (manual digit IV 4) that supported the tip of the wing. =Skull= Most of the skull is known. The laterally narrow and vertically deep skull is similar to that of Dimorphodon, with an enormous external naris (nostril) being the largest skull opening, and a large antorbital fenestra. Unlike most pterosaurs, the margin of the antorbital fenestra bears a remnant of an antorbital fossa. The skull roof has a median ridge as well as large ridges along the medial borders of the upper temporal fenestra that mark attachments for the muscle that closed the mandible. A prominent hood at the back of the skull, the nuchal crest, marks the attachment of large neck muscles. Sizeable pneumatic openings on the skull top lead into small pneumatic chambers in the skull roof. The uncrushed skull cap permitted the first endocranial reconstruction in a Triassic pterosaur and shows the brain had large cerebral lobes, from which the optic lobes bulge, and small olfactory lobes. The lower portion of the front of the mandible has a keel. There are large pneumatic openings in the posterior mandible and the whole of the mandible is hollow and was likely air-filled (pneumatic). Caelestiventus is a heterodont, with three different tooth shapes - long fang-like spikes, large \\"leaf-shaped\\" blades, and tiny blades. There are two long, spike-shaped teeth near the front of each side of the lower jaws that were likely opposed by similar teeth at the tip of the skull snout (premaxilla). In the lower jaws, behind the fangs, there is a tooth gap (diastema) which is followed by 38 tiny teeth on each side of the lower jaw (mandibular ramus). Each upper jaw bone (maxilla) is armed with twelve large, blade-like, triangular teeth. Both sides of the maxillary teeth are strengthened by a central ridge and these teeth terminate in two tips (bicuspid). Classification Phylogenetic analyses show Caelestiventus as the sister taxon to Dimorphodon macronyx in the family Dimorphodontidae, which was defined by Britt and colleagues as the most inclusive clade containing of Caelestiventus hanseni and Dimorphodon macronyx, the only two genera recovered as dimorphodontids in their analyses. They also found that the purported Dimorphodon species 'D.' weintraubi is the sister taxon to Anurognathidae, and thus was outside of Dimorphodontidae as defined by Britt and colleagues. Paleoecology Pterosaurs ranged from the Late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous. The earliest known pterosaurs are from the late Triassic Period and provide insights into the origin and diversification of the group. Triassic pterosaurs, however, are rare. In 2014, just twenty-seven specimens were reported to be known, many consisting of a single bone. All but one, Arcticodactylus, come from the Alps. In addition to Caelestiventus, the Saints & Sinners Quarry has produced a diverse vertebrate fauna including two sphenosuchian genera, two sphenodontian genera, a drepanosaurid, a procolophonid and two theropod dinosaurs ‚Äì a coelophysoid and a medium-sized genus represented only by teeth. No invertebrates are known from the site. Plants from the quarry consist of Bennettitalean fronds.

After her first husband's death, she converted to Protestantism and married Gaspard II de Coligny, who was later killed in the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre. Life =Early life= Jacqueline's mother Beatrix in 1533 by Corneille de Lyon. Jacqueline was the only daughter and sole heir of the Montbel d'Entremont family, a family with several fiefdoms in Savoy, Bresse, Bugey and Piedmont. Her mother was lady B√©atrix Pacheco d'Ascalana, a young Spanish woman of Portuguese descent. B√©atrix's father was Jean, count of Sifuente and duke of Ascalana, who was descended from Juan Pacheco da Silva, a Portuguese page who had gone to serve the prince of the Asturies around 1440, fought with distinction at the battle of Olmedo and was made duke of Ascalana by the king of Castille and Leon.Anne Weigel. Ibid page 24 A drawing of B√©atrix by Jean Clouet is now at the Mus√©e Cond√©.(MN.177) She was maid of honour to queen Eleanor of Habsburg (1498-1558), sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor - on the death of Eleanor's first husband Manuel I of Portugal in 1521 she remarried in 1530 to Francis I of France and moved her Spanish courtiers and ladies in waiting into the Louvre Palace - one of them was B√©atrix. Louise de Montmorency, countess of Coligny and mother of Gaspard de Coligny was also in the Louvre at around the same time, whilst another of Eleanor's ladies in waiting was Diane de Poitiers. After the Duchy of Savoy was occupied by French troops in 1536, the lords of Savoy were all invited to the French court. Charles III, Duke of Savoy fell and was forced into exile in Nice, forcing the lords to abandon Turin and go to meet Francis I. One of them was S√©bastien, count of Entremont and Montbel, lord of Montellier, Natage and Saint-Maurice. In Paris he met B√©atrix and married her on 17 September 1539 in the presence of the Dauphin (the future Henry II of France), Jean de Menthon, Philibert de Gilly and Louise de Montmorency, wife of Gaspard I de Coligny.Samuel Guichenon, Histoire de Bresse et du Bugey, page 177. Their only daughter and heir Jacqueline was born in Paris on 16 February 1541 and grew up in the Louvre until she was six. When Francis I died in 1547 his widow Eleanor took refuge in the Spanish Netherlands, home of her sister Mary of Hungary. B√©atrix and Jacqueline went with her and Jacqueline remained in the royal court in Brussels until she was sixteen, at which age she was chosen to be maid of honour to princess Marguerite of France (1523-1574), Henry II's sister and future duchess of Savoy via her marriage to Emmanuel-Philibert de Savoie. Jacqueline thus returned to the Louvre in 1557, whilst her mother moved to the ch√¢teau de Saint-Andr√© at Briord in Bugey. The Duke of Savoy beat the French at the battle of Saint-Quentin in 1557 and two years later the treaties of Cateau- Cambr√©sis agreed to the gradual evacuation of the French occupation forces from Savoy and Piedmont. However, he had to fight hard to defend his territories from incursions by Protestant forces from Geneva and by French forces which still held certain strategic positions. He recalled the Savoyard noblemen who had been in the French court for the last twenty-five years and gave them posts in his new army and government. He also forbade Savoyard noblewomen from marrying foreigners or Protestants, so that estates of Savoy remained in Savoy's hands. His biggest prize was the comte de Montbel (they had a family connection and the duke had been baptised in the arms of the count's paternal great aunt in 1528Anne Weigel, Jacqueline d'Entremont, SSHA, 2008, page 29) and the duke demanded that he come to court for the duke to present him with the collar of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation. However, he placed two conditions on its presentation - \\"when she reaches marriageable age, Jacqueline must marry a Savoyard lord of identical rank and of Catholic religion. The safety of the States of Savoy is at stake.\\" =First marriage= The French court became a battleground between Protestant and Catholic factions until 30 June 1559, when Henry II of France died of wounds incurred at a joust he had organised in honour of his sister Marguerite's marriage to Emmanuel-Philibert, Duke of Savoy. Henry's son Francis II of France succeeded him and his wife Mary became queen consort. Francis entrusted ruling the kingdom to princes of the House of Guise, accelerating the French Wars of Religion. He died himself in 1560 and his younger brother Charles succeeded him aged only ten years old. Real power lay with the regent, his mother Catherine de Medici and on 24 August 1572 the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre broke out. Aged twenty, plans arose to marry Jacqueline to a French lord, despite her father's assurances that she would marry a Savoyard. Her mother favoured Claude de Bastarnay, the nephew of Diane de Poitiers, who she had served alongside as a lady in waiting to Eleanor. De Bastarnay, count of Bouchage and baron of Anthon, was the son of Ren√© de Bastarnay and Isabelle de Savoie (daughter of Ren√© de Savoie, known as \\"the Great Bastard of Savoy\\". In his Histoire de la Bresse et du Bugey, Samuel Guichenon states that the marriage \\"had great difficulty in succeeding, since -as the countess Jacqueline was extraordinarily rich and powerful in estates - the Duke of Savoy, her natural prince, wished her to marry one of his lords. However, king Charles IX having written in favour of the comte du Bouchage, their marriage took place on 16 February 1561.\\". Basternay was kept away from his young wife fighting as a Catholic in the Wars of Religion and so the marriage remained childless. He was killed at the Battle of Saint-Denis, where the Protestant forces were led by Jacqueline's future second husband Gaspard II de Coligny. The 74-year-old constable Anne de Montmorency (1493-1567) was shot in the back by a Protestant whilst being captured - he was the uncle of both Basternay (his sister-in-law Isabella of Savoy's son) and Coligny (his sister Louise's son). =Second marriage= Jacqueline took refuge with her mother at Briord where she met her old friend the Savoy poet Marc-Claude de Buttet and Th√©odore de B√®ze, previously part of the 'brigade of poets' who were the forerunners of La Pl√©iade of Ronsard, who she had previously known at the Louvre.Anne Weigel, Jacqueline d'Entremont, SSHA, 2008, pages 66 √† 79 De Buttet had taken refuge in his village at Tresserve beside Lac du Bourget - he had been a prot√©g√© of Odet de Coligny and Margaret of France. He chose B√©atrix Pacheco Da Silva as his muse and his platonic love, giving her the alter-ego of Amalthea. Twelve years later, Jacqueline d'Entremont arrived at Henry II's court and took over from her mother as de Buttet's muse on her return from Brussels. She may also have taken over the pseudonym of Amalthea, though historians are still divided on which woman exactly is behind that name. Sarah Alyn Stacey, Marc-Claude de Buttet, l'Honneur de la Savoie, Honor√© Champion, Paris, 2006, 235 P. Th√©odore de B√®ze was then a Protestant minister in Geneva, famous for his conviction and eloquence - he converted the countess of Entremont to Protestantism and she went on to abjure Catholicism officially at the Duke of Savoy's high court. B√®ze was also a close friend of admiral Gaspard II de Coligny, leader of the French Protestants. They both took part in the Colloquy of Poissy between 9 and 26 September 1561, disputing with Catholic theologians - from then on all Coligny's actions were influenced by B√®ze. Despite the Colloquy's setbacks, B√®ze and Coligny went on to get the twelve-year-old Francis II to sign the Edict of January 1562, also known as the Edict of Tolerance, which gave French Protestants official legal recognition and the right to gather for worship in certain villages. However, this settlement was broken by the Massacre of Wassy by Francis, Duke of Guise's troops on 1 March 1562 and the religious wars broke out again. Francis was stabbed by an assassin on 18 February 1563 and died of his wounds six days later - in his Histoire Eccle√©siatique, B√®ze wrote that \\"Solemn thanks were rendered with great rejoicings\\" for Francis' death. On 3 March 1568 Coligny's wife Charlotte de Laval died - they had had eight children and he grieved deeply for her. B√®ze advised Jacqueline to marry Coligny - she had met him many times at the Louvre since her return from Brussels in 1557 and knew him well, whilst both their mothers had both been ladies in waiting to Eleanor (Coligny's mother had been summoned to court for that purpose in 1530 and Coligny and his brothers Odet and Fran√ßois came with her and studied alongside the king's children). However, Coligny was unenthusiastic about the match, feeling preoccupied by his campaigning, thinking that the twenty-three-year age-gap between them was too large and self-conscious about the major wound which he had received on 3 October 1569 at the battle of Moncontour against a royal force under the future Henry III (he had been shot in the face by the Rhingrave, though he had managed to fire back at point blank range and defeat him). Even so, B√®ze insisted in a letter to Ren√©e of Ferrara: \\"Mme d'Entremont is a lady endowed with virtues and God's rarest gifts, and is one of the richest jewels of the land in which she lives\\". He insisted on Coligny to \\"work towards this union as it pleases God\\" and managed to convince him. In deep secrecy Jacqueline rode across France with a small escort, meeting no obstacles, and she and Coligny signed their marriage contract in the house of Fran√ßois III, count of La Rochefoucauld on 24 March 1571 in the presence of Jeanne d'Albret, Henry of Navarre, Fran√ßois de Bourbon-Conti and Louis of Nassau.Anne Weigel, Ibid page 95) The nuptial blessing took place the following day, 25 March, at La Rochelle, then a Protestant fiefdom. The Duke of Savoy still banned all his subjects from marrying outside Savoy under pain of confiscation of their lands via his 31 January 1569 Edict of Turin. However, he was unable to prevent Jacqueline's second marriage and contemporary chroniclers report that she \\"uniquely sensible of Coligny's merit, had resolved (if necessary) to sacrifice the most shining fortune for the sake of having him as her husband\\". =St Bartholomew's Day Massacre= Four months pregnant, Jacqueline was kept in safety at the Ch√¢teau de Ch√¢tillon-Coligny. Coligny foresaw the threat to his family, since he was blamed for the death of Francis, Duke of Guise. He was invited to Paris at the head of a delegation of French Protestant lords to assist at the marriage of Charles IX of France's sister Margaret of Valois to her cousin Henry of Navarre (the future Henry IV). On 22 August 1572 an attempt was made on his life with a crossbow and though he was only wounded in the arm he took no further precautions, seemingly resigned to death. Late at night on 23‚Äì24 August 1572 the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre broke out - he was the first of its 5,000 victims in Paris and around 10,000 victims in Provence. The day before the attack, he had written a last letter to his wife - \\"My Mie, I write you this letter to warn you that the wedding of Milady, the king's sister, took place today... If I only regarded my contentment, I would be better pleased to come see you than to stay at court for many reasons that I will tell you... Several small peculiarities have occurred that I have omitted to tell you but which I shall tell you in person... And yet I pray that Our Lord will have in his holy guard you, my daughter, my sister.\\".Anne Weigel. Ibid. Page 112 Now a widow known as Madame l'Amirale de Coligny, Jacqueline had the many children of Coligny's first marriage to look after - she sent Francis and Odet (aged 15 and 12) to safety in Switzerland under heavy guard, but thought that the eight-year-old Charles de Coligny was too young to join them. The day after the massacre, the king's knights arrested Charles and he grew up at the royal court. Her servants at Ch√¢tillon were imprisoned and Jacqueline, her step-daughter Louise de T√©ligny and two servants had to await a verdict from the king and Catherine de Medici. This proved to be expulsion from France and in mid-September 1572 twenty-five cavalrymen accompanied them to the ch√¢teau de Saint-Andr√© at Briord, where Jacqueline's mother was waiting. Jacqueline thus found herself back on Savoyard territory and back under the rule of the Duke of Savoy. On 21 December 1572 Jacqueline gave birth to a daughter and named her Beatrice after Jacqueline's mother. One of the conditions of Jacqueline's return to Savoy was not only her conversion back to Catholicism but also that her child should be baptized a Catholic - the baptism took place almost in secret and without ceremony at the parish church in Briord, in the presence of some servants and the child's grandmother. Coligny's wish that his friend Frederick III, Elector Palatine should be a godfather was ignored and he did not know of the birth. Exhausted by the birth, Jacqueline entrusted B√©atrice to a wet nurse under the supervision of Jacqueline's mother. Louis Milliet, president of the Senate of Savoy, managed to persuade the Duke not to send the child to his court at Turin as he had intended - the Duke had imagined that a plot was being hatched to kidnap the child since it was the heir to the fiefdoms of Montbel, but Milliet pointed out that count S√©bastien de Montbel's will stated that \\"only the first male heir, born of his sister Jacqueline, shall be heir after her, to continue its name and its arms, and females will be debarred.\\"Anne Weigel. Ibid Page 157) However, Jacqueline refused to renounce her Protestantism, kept up a correspondence with the Protestants in Basel, received ambassadors from Geneva and on 15 January 1573 commanded the polemicist Fran√ßois Hotman to write a biography glorifying Coligny. This risked the fiefdoms of Montbel on Savoy's frontier falling into foreign Protestant hands should Jacqueline marry a third time and so the Duke of Savoy proposed that she come to Turin to clarify the situation. She was won over by this proposal, since she still had strong support at the court in Turin - she had previously been maid of honour to the duke's wife Margaret at the Louvre and Margaret had kept up excellent relations with Protestant families, secretly sending them financial support. On 22 February 1573 Jacqueline and her Savoyard escort had got as far as col du Mont-Cenis, where they were surprised to learn that the Duke was awaiting them at Nice, to which he had been displaced. She was therefore forced to re-route and meet him there, guarded by twelve Piedmontese archers commanded by Andr√© Provana de Leyni. Ending her journey with a leg at sea, Jacqueline was imprisoned in the fortress at Nice on her arrival on 8 March. This provoked general outrage and several ambassadors were sent by her mother and by the Calvinists - for example, on 7 October 1574 Henri, Prince of Cond√© requested that a special case be made for his aunt, stating \\"If you take pity on my aunt ... and wish to free her from captivity and the prison in which she is so strictly detained and return all her lands and her full liberty, you can be assured of receiving this thanks, that she shall bear herself with such modesty in subjection and obedience as she must, that you shall have no other occasion to complain of her.\\"Anne Weigel. Ibid page 171 However, the Duke stood firm and insisted that she renounce her Protestantism and resume her loyalty to him. Even after much manoeuvring and a journey to Turin and back, Jacqueline still refused to renounce her Protestantism in the forms insisted on by the Duke and the Catholic hierarchy. She lost a major supporter when Margaret died in Turin on 15 September 1574 and finally renounced Calvinism on 7 April 1575, with the bishop of Nice Fran√ßois de Lambert receiving her back into the Catholic faith. She then signed an agreement at Nice on 1 May 1575 that committed her to house arrest after two years and three months' imprisonment. =Final years= Between 1575 and 1594 Jacqueline was once again officially dowager countess of Montbel d'Entremont and resumed her life at the court in Turin. She took part in all the festivities and intrigues and gave birth to an illegitimate daughter in great secrecy in February 1578 - she was christened Marguerite after Margaret, the late duchess of Savoy. The father was the Duke of Savoy and the child was adopted by Cassandre, countess of None and sister of Andr√© Provana de Leyni. The secret was so well guarded that it was only discovered in the 19th century - in 1870 the historian Victor de Saint-Genis argued that against its historicity, but fourteen years later this was proven by Gaudenzio Claretta, a historian from Turin. The Duke died on 30 August 1580 and his son and successor Charles Emmanuel I redressed many issues with the neighbouring nations of France and Geneva. Intrigues continued at the ducal court in Turin and Jacqueline was strongly suspected of secretly negotiating with Henry IV of France after his conversion to Catholicism and his coronation at Chartres on 27 February 1594. The Holy Office had been kept informed of Jacqueline's affair and when Marguerite was suspected of being possessed by a demon it accused Jacqueline of witchcraft.Anne Weigel, Jacqueline de Montbel d'Entremont, SSHA, Chamb√©ry, numero 15-2008M Cardinal d'Ossat defended her, but she was imprisoned in the Moncalieri fortress in Turin. She was cleared of sorcery but kept in prison on new charges of treason. She was transferred to the prison at Ivrea on 17 April 1598. Henry IV sent a letter in her favour on 30 June 1598, instructing his ambassador Guillaume de Gadagne, lord of Bouth√©on to \\"help my cousin the wife of the Admiral of Castillon, who is treated very strictly by her officers, for no other reason than for always being very helpful in assisting my affairs. She had been accused of sorcery and had been treated badly before, having been transported from the cruel prison of the Chateau de Montcallier to a crueler one, the Castle of Ivrea, where it is not lawful for her daughter to see her, write to her or receive news of her, and this only for having helped in my service without committing any felony against the said duke, as you will tell him, begging him , to have her delivered for my sake, and henceforth to live as a good neighbor and friend, as he wrote to me in a letter which the said Lullin presented to me.\\"Anne Weigel. Ibid, p. 222 She remained in prison until her death. According to Ossat she seems to have received the Catholic last rites, though her place of burial is unknown. Only thirteen years later, in 1601, Charles Emmanuel I was forced to cede Bresse, Bugey le Valromey and the country of Gex once and for all to Henry IV.

Founded in 1951, WFMT is considered as one of the most admired classical music stations in the U.S. and under his leadership many new programs were added to the local schedule, including Introductions, Impromptu and others. Robinson worked on diversifying the programs of WFMT by expanding the amount of live broadcasting from the station. One of his most important initiatives at the WFMT Radio Network was the creation of Exploring Music with Bill McGlaughlin, in 2003. This daily, one-hour music appreciation program is heard on over 60 U.S. stations and has a weekly audience of over 400,000 unique listeners. The program is also heard in Australia, Guam, the Philippines and in Beijing. Initial funding for Exploring Music was provided by the National Endowment for the Arts with additional funding from individuals and foundations. The station under his leadership focused on live music by broadcasting a wide array of local Chicago groups and ensembles. In 2007, the Chicago Tribune named him ‚ÄúChicagoan of the Year‚Äù in the arts.

Life  Budic was the son of Count Judica√´l of Nantes, From 1005 to 1010, he ruled under the scrutiny of Walter II, Bishop of Nantes (1005-1041) who had been appointed by the Count of Rennes Geoffrey I of Brittany. Budic took advantage of the Bishop's pilgrimage in the Holy Land around 1020 to seize the episcopal possession and destroy the prelate's castle. Back in Brittany, the Bishop asked for the Count of Renne's intervention while Budic asked for Count Fulk III of Anjou's assistance. This led to the loss of part of the lands held by the Counts of Nantes in the south of Loire, that is to say almost the whole Mauges, in 1025. The building of Clisson castle was the sign of the Count of Nantes' wish to stop the progression of the County of Anjou. Around 1030, after a last conflict with Alan III, Budic sided with the Count of Rennes.

It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History What is now Bay Township, Michigan was part of Evangeline Township, established in 1855. However, settlement of the township was sparse until the early 1870s, when the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad constructed a line to Petoskey. During the 1872/73 school year, the county was split into four school districts; District Number 3 included the area around what is now Horton Bay. During the 1877/75 school year, a log schoolhouse was built at the corner of what are today Sumner and Camp Daggett roads, about a mile east of Horton Bay. The log schoolhouse served District Number 3 until the 1885/86 school year. During the 1885/86 school year, District Number 3 spent $627.43 to construct this school, then located at the corner of Camp Sherwood and Zenith Heights roads, two miles east of Horton Bay. Around the same time, another frame schoolhouse was constructed for District Number 2, and located on this site. In 1887, Bay Township was carved out of Evangeline Township, with the former Evangeline Township School Districts 2 and 3 becoming the new Bay Township School Districts 2 and 3. This building served the students of Bay Township School District 3 until 1943, when the district was consolidated with the Boyne City schools. However, in the mid-1940s, the schoolhouse used by Bay Township School District 2 burned, and classes were held in the township hall for two years. In the later 1940s, the Boyne City School District auctioned off the old Bay Township School District 3 building, and Bay Township School District 2 submitted the winning bid. This building was moved to Horton Bay, to the site of the burned school. It continued to serve the students of Bay Township School District 2 until 1963, when this district was also consolidated into a neighboring district. After being closed as a school, the building became the property of the nearby Horton Bay United Methodist Church, who used it as a parish house. However, the building became used less and less, and by the early 2000s, the church considered selling the building for removal from the site. A Horton Bay Schoolhouse Restoration Committee was established to raise funds and restore the building. Description The Horton Bay School is a single story, gable-front building with an open square-plan and a pyramid-roof cupola containing a large bell. The walls are white-painted and clapboarded walls. The front of the building has an open shed-roof porch, and the rear has a low hip-roof woodshed projection. The interior of the school has an entry vestibule flanked with boys' and girls' cloakrooms. Exits from the cloakrooms lead to the single large schoolroom, at the back of which are small paneled doors for the girls' and boys' toilets, and another door leading to the woodshed. The walls have three-foot high wainscoting, and slate blackboards line one wall.

Few members of this gens are mentioned by the ancient historians, of whom the most famous may be a certain Marcus Pacilius spoken of by Cicero in his second oration against Verres. However, many Pacilii are known from inscriptions.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 80 (\\"Marcus Pacilius\\"). Origin The nomen Pacilius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from other names, using the suffix '.Chase, pp. 123. In this case, the nomen is derived from the cognomen Pacilus, a name of Oscan origin, itself perhaps derived from the Oscan Paccius, which was used both as praenomen and gentilicium.Chase, pp. 114, 115, 128. It would therefore be a cognate of Paccius, and perhaps also of Pacidius. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Pacilii were Publius, Lucius, Marcus, Gnaeus, Quintus, and Gaius. There are individual examples of other names, including Aulus, Sextus, and Spurius. All but the last were common throughout Roman history; Spurius was used chiefly during the Republic.

Viewed from within the Tame Chapel 1846 drawing of ledger stone of John Tame John Tame (c. 1430 \\\\- 8 May 1500) of Cirencester and of Beauchamp Court (or \\"Warwick Court\\") in the parish of Fairford, both in Gloucestershire, England, was a wealthy wool producer and merchant who re-built the surviving St. Mary's Church, Fairford, the former structure of which had been built by one of the Beauchamp Earls of Warwick in the 15th century. The 28 magnificent Fairford stained glass windows he installed in the church are considered amongst the finest and most complete in England. He and his son Sir Edmund Tame (d.1534) so fostered the trade transacted at Fairford, that it came to rival that of the nearby long- established town of Cirencester, which increase was remarked upon by his contemporary the antiquary John Leland (d.1552): \\"Fairford never flourished afore the cumming of the Tames into it\\".Quoted in Neale, p.119\\"Before the comynge of John Tame, when he settled the trade and manufacture of wool and clothing, it (Fairford) never flourished; but by his endeavours and his son Edmund, there was as great a trade drove there as at Cirencester.\\" (MS. ltin. A. Wood, quoted in \\"Account of Fairford,\\" 1791) Quoted in Neale Origins According to his near contemporary the antiquary John Leland (d.1552), John Tame \\"came out of the house of Tame of Stowel\\" and \\"The elder house of the Tames is at Stowell, by Northleche in Gloucestershire\\".Quoted in Neale, p.117 The Tames of Stowell were wool merchants and cloth dealers, already well established in the early 15th century. John Tame (d.1500) was one of the two sons of John Tame of Stowell, the other son being Richard Tame who went to Calais or the Netherlands to conduct the foreign branch of the family's wool trade. The parish of Stowell in the Cotswold Hills is one of the smallest in Gloucestershire. The manor of Stowell, within the parish, was inherited by the senior line of the Tame family long after the Tames of Fairford rose to prominence, when Thomas Tame (died c. 1545), a sheep breeder, inherited it from his mother Agnes Limerick, daughter and heiress of Thomas Limerick (d.1486) of Stowell, and husband of William Tame.Carol Davidson Cragoe, A R J Jurica and Elizabeth Williamson, \\"Parishes: Stowell\\", in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 9, Bradley Hundred. The Northleach Area of the Cotswolds, ed. N M Herbert (London, 2001), pp. 208-217 Career John Tame was a merchant of the City of London, and according to the Gloucestershire historian Ralph Bigland (d.1784), served as Sheriff of the City of London. In 1492, soon after the siege of Boulogne (1491), Tame, presumably sailing under letters of marque, captured a vessel bound for Rome from the Low Countries.Neale, p.117 It is stated by Neale (1846) that the captured ship was carrying a beautiful set of twenty-eight stained-glass windows, intended for a present to the Pope and that Tame brought the glass, and the workmen who were accompanying it, to England, and in order to display it fittingly, decided to rebuild the parish church at Fairford \\"on a plan of costly magnificence, suited to the beautiful windows which he intended thus to consecrate to God.\\" This task he commenced in 1493. However it is now believed that the glass was in fact made at Westminster by the Flemish glazier Barnard Flower (d.1517), glazier to King Henry VII (1485-1509), and thus the story of the glass having been seized from a foreign ship is inaccurate. =Acquires Fairford= In 1479 John Tame, together with the Cirencester lawyer and clothier John Twynyho (d.1485), had obtained a lease of the demesne of the manor of Fairford from King Henry VII, to whom the manor had temporarily reverted during the minority of Edward Plantagenet (1475-1499) (later 17th Earl of Warwick), son of George, 1st Duke of Clarence, 1st Earl of Warwick (d. 1478) by his wife, the heiress of Fairford, Isabel Neville. Isabelle Neville was one of the daughters and co- heiresses of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (d.1471) \\"The King-Maker\\" by his wife Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick (d.1492), who inherited Fairford on the death of her niece Anne de Beauchamp (d.1449), daughter of Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick (d.1446), whose mother was Isabel le Despenser (d.1439).'Fairford', in A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 7, ed. N. M. Herbert (Oxford, 1981), pp. 69-86 John Tame (or his son) memorialised these noble families which had been connected with the manor of Fairford (de Clare, Despencer, Beauchamp) by the inclusion of their armorials (together with those of Tame) on the tower of Fairford Church.Bigland, Ralph, An Account of the Parish of Fairford, p.5 Tame also acquired the manor of Rendcomb, Gloucestershire, by grant from the Crown, to which it had reverted after the attainder of the Earl of Warwick. His son Sir Edmund Tame rebuilt Rendcomb Church. In 1497 John and his son Edmund Tame levied a fine of land in Hatherop, an adjacent village. John Tame died before he had completed the rebuilding of Fairford Church, which task was finished by his son Edmund. John Tame's business headquarters were at Cirencester,BGAS, Vol.53, 1931, p.91 and his great wealth derived from the production and sale of wool, which came from his vast flocks of sheep for the grazing of which he secured large tracts of land. Amongst the many bequests in his will were those to four of his \\"head shepherds\\" at various places. Fairford Church \\"Great West Window\\", Fairford Church, depicting the Last Judgement and related scenes. One of the 28 magnificent Fairford stained glass windows installed in his church by John Tame John Tame built Fairford Church purposely for the reception of his stained glass, and thus the design is \\"necessarily somewhat cramped\\". Twenty- eight stained glass windows survive, considered amongst the best in England of the period. The church was consecrated in 1497 by the Bishop of Worcester, within whose diocese lay most of Gloucestershire at that time. Marriage and progeny He married Alice Twynyho (d. 20 December 1471)Keble, Rev. Edward, St. Mary's Church, Fairford. 6th. ed., Much Wenlock, 2010, p.27 a daughter of John Twynyho (d.1485), a lawyer and cloth merchant of Cirencester who had acquired the lease of Fairford in partnership with John Tame, whose monumental brass survives in Lechlade Church, Gloucestershire. By his wife he had progeny as follows: *William Tame, eldest son, disinherited by his father; *Sir Edmund I Tame (d.1534) of Rayton, second son and heir, a courtier and Knight of the Body of King Henry VIII,Gloucestershire Notes & Queries, Monumental Brasses, p.148 knighted by King Henry VIII in 1516, Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1505 and 1513, and father of Edmund II Tame.

Between 1960 and 1963, he was also the Editor of the Christian Messenger, established by the Basel Mission in 1883, as the newspaper of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana.  Early life and family  Carl H. Clerk Carl Henry Clerk was born at Aburi, about forty-five minutes north-east of the capital city, Accra, on 4 January 1895. He was born in the home of his paternal grandfather, Alexander Worthy Clerk (1820‚Äì1906). His father was Nicholas Timothy Clerk (1862‚Äì1961), a Basel-trained theologian and missionary, was the first Synod Clerk of the Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1918 to 1932 and a founding father of the all boys‚Äô boarding high school, the Presbyterian Boys‚Äô Secondary School, established in 1938. His mother, Anna Alice Meyer (1873‚Äì1934) was of Ga-Danish descent. According to the Swiss German church historian and theologian, Hans Werner Debrunner, Carl Clerk's father, Nicholas Timothy Clerk, contemplated sending his young son to (Germany) in 1899 so he could receive well-rounded training in his formative years. N. T. Clerk was \\"worried about the possible effect of unsettled, isolated life confined to the interior\\" of the hinterlands, on his son's upbringing and development. Besides, Clerk wanted his son \\"to be a missionary or an engineer in the service of the mission.\\" However, his Basel Mission colleagues strongly discouraged him, with the advice, \\"the best Christian education was the one given to a child by his own Christian parents.\\" C.H. Clerk's paternal grandfather, Alexander Worthy Clerk, a Jamaican Moravian missionary arrived in the Danish Protectorate of Christiansborg, now the suburb of Osu, in Accra, Gold Coast in 1843, as part of the original group of 24 West Indian missionaries who worked under the auspices of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society of Basel, Switzerland. A.W. Clerk was a pioneer of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana and a leader in education in colonial Ghana, establishing a boarding middle school, the Salem School in 1843. His paternal grandmother, Pauline Hesse (1831‚Äì1909) was from the Gold Coast, and was of Danish, German and Ga heritage. His grandaunt was Regina Hesse (1832 ‚îÄ 1898), a pioneer educator and school principal. A third generation member of the historically notable Clerk family, Carl Clerk had 8 siblings. His younger brother, Theodore S. Clerk (1909‚Äì1965) was the first Ghanaian architect who planned and developed the port city of Tema. His younger sisters were Jane E. Clerk (1904‚Äì1999), a pioneer woman education administrator and Matilda J.

Clerk then attended the Basel Mission Seminary at Akropong (now known as the Presbyterian College of Education, Akropong) from 1912 to 1916, where he received training in pedagogy and theology. The seminary was founded by the Basel Mission in 1848, as the second oldest higher educational institution in early modern West Africa after Fourah Bay College which was established in 1827.

At Tuskegee, Clerk studied the works of the American botanist, George Washington Carver who was then a research faculty member at the Institute. In his college yearbook, Clerk was nicknamed \\"The Prof\\" by his classmates, an allusion to his studiousness and erudite stature. After completing his graduate studies at Columbia, Carl Clerk sailed to his homeland from the Port of New York, aboard the steamship, the TSS Tuscania anchor line, and via the Port of Glasgow in Scotland, according to a 1926 passenger manifest. He arrived in Glasgow on 26 March 1926.  Career  = Teaching and education management = Clerk dedicated his entire life to public service.

Publisher George Morrill moved the printing plant to Haller City in 1890, becoming The Haller City Times, until moving into Arlington in 1894. It later absorbed the Haller City News, which had been published since 1879. On July 17, 1897, the newspaper was renamed to The Arlington Times. On November 7, 1918, The Times published an erroneous dispatch from the United Press Association announcing that the ongoing war had ceased and an armistice was to be signed later in the day. The dispatch was actually reporting on a temporary ceasefire while German delegates arrived in Paris to negotiate an armistice, which was reached five days later. The article triggered celebrations in the city, including the hoisting of a wooden coffin for Kaiser Wilhelm II, and continued into the night despite the dispatch being rescinded. A celebration was also held for the actual armistice days later with 3,000 residents and visitors who doubled the city's population.

Upon release, the film received positive reviews from critics and grossed $50 million worldwide against its $20 million budget. As of March 2018, the film had topped 8 million admissions worldwide. The film was released on DVD on May 1, 2018, in the United States. A sequel titled Bigfoot Family (also known as Bigfoot Superstar) was released on August 5, 2020. Plot HairCo. is a megacorporation run by Wallace Eastman (Terrence Stone) that specializes in improving people's hair. His helicopter chases after a scientist named Dr. Harrison who escapes by jumping into a river. 12 Years later, a young boy named Adam Harrison (Pappy Faulkner), son of Dr. Harrison, lives with his mother Shelly but keeps being harassed by the local bullies Tony (Yuri Lowenthal), Dale (Nicholas Marj), and Garcia (Barry D. Buckner), being unjustly judged by other students, and being the mutual crush of a kindhearted girl named Emma (Shylo Summer). But over time he also notices that strange things start happening to him, like his feet growing bigger so his toes stick out of his shoes, and his hair growing right back over night even after his mother gave it a complete chop. After discovering not only the fact that his father is alive, but also his current location from a box his mother Shelly (Marieve Herington) had kept hidden, Adam sets out on an epic and daring quest to uncover the mystery behind his long-lost dad only to find out that he is none other than the legendary Bigfoot (Christopher L. Parsons). He has been hiding deep in the forest for years to protect himself and his family from Eastman who is eager to run scientific experiments with his special DNA. What neither of them knew was that a cowboy man driving a truck had nearly run over Adam. Dr. Harrison saved Adam, but the cowboy man got some footage of it, and put it in the newspaper. Adam discovers that he too is gifted with superpowers similar to his dad like having large feet, supersonic hearing, running at incredible speeds, and speaking to animals like Tina the squirrel (Sandy Fox), Trapper the raccoon (Joe Ochman), his wife Weecha (Laila Berzins), Wilbur the bear (Michael Sorich), and Steve the woodpecker (Joe J. Thomas). Meanwhile, Eastman heard about the sighting, and although reluctant follows the traces to Bigfoot. In order to draw out Adam, Eastman arranges for his mother's car to be intercepted by his men. The men roam the forest to search for more evidence. After Adam is apprehended, he sends them to a false site, where they fail greatly. This results using Adam as bait to lure Bigfoot (father), ending with Bigfoot being captured. Eastman and his scientist Dr. Billingsley (Alan Shearman) begin their experiment on Bigfoot. The hair sample is tested on Dr. Billingsley's usual intern (Brody Hessin) who asks Dr. Billingsley to sign his volunteer paper (a running gag through part of the film). The sample causes the intern to grow extra- ordinarily long hair all over his body. With the help of the animals, Adam rescues his father, leading to the destruction of HairCo. facility. Eastman is tranquilized by Shelly as Bigfoot states that he is done with hiding. Dr. Billingsley crawls out of the wreckage as his intern tries to get him to sign his volunteer paper. Tired of hiding, Bigfoot returns home and the animals have taken to living with the family. A magazine cover shows that Wallace Eastman has been arrested for his illegal activities. On his way to school, Adam's bullies attempt to haze him again. Having gone on his journey, Adam calmly tells them that he's finally had enough and kindly asks to be left alone. When they refuse to comply, Adam summons his animal buddies who scare them into leaving him alone while secretly dismantling their bikes and skateboard to make them crash to further punish them for their previous harassing of Adam which the latter sees and laughs at. Adam dismisses his friends as Emma spots the scene and asks about it. Adam asks if she would walk with him to school and she agrees while he begins to explain his life to her.

The shooting was an apparent murder‚Äìsuicide and an act of domestic violence. Three people‚Äîthe gunman; his wife, who taught at the school; and a student standing behind her‚Äîdied from their wounds. Another student was wounded. Background The shooting followed a terrorist attack that occurred in San Bernardino in December 2015. After that attack, the San Bernardino City Unified School District reexamined its security measures and gave all of the school principals lockdown training. North Park Elementary School is located about from the Inland Regional Center, the main location of the 2015 terrorist attack. Events =Shooting= On the morning of April 10, external CCTV recorded the gunman's failed attempt to enter North Park Elementary School through a locked secondary door. He then went through the main entrance and was permitted entry after he told administrators that he had to drop something off to his wife. He was allowed entry as it was not uncommon for someone to visit a school campus to meet up with their spouse, and no one noticed his concealed gun. Staffers were also already aware of the gunman beforehand, but had no knowledge of the couple's ongoing conflict, and did not recognize any signs of agitation from him. Shortly before 10:30 a.m., he entered Classroom B-1, a special education classroom where his wife taught at, and walked \\"a short distance\\" inside. The 53-year-old teacher was standing in the middle of the room, about ten to fifteen feet away from the door. Without saying a word, the man opened fire with a \\"large-caliber revolver\\", firing ten rounds and reloading once before shooting himself. Both the gunman and the teacher died. There were fifteen students ranging from the first to fourth grades, along with two teacher's aides, also in the classroom at the time. Two of the students suffered gunshot wounds, with one of them mortally wounded. A nine- year-old girl who witnessed the shooting said that the gunman \\"shot everywhere\\", and that one of the students was shot in the stomach. According to Laura Dillon, her son (Gavin Dillon), who was in a next-door classroom and knew one of the injured students, overheard \\"four loud booms\\", people yelling \\"No! Don't!\\", and the gunman reloading. Other teachers initially mistook the gunshots as loud noises being caused by a maintenance crew working nearby. When they realized an active shooting was underway, one of the teachers left her workroom to shepherd students in the hallway to safety and to check on classrooms. She eventually sought shelter inside a classroom. =Emergency response= The first responding officers arrived at North Park Elementary School within seven minutes of receiving the first 9-1-1 call. They confirmed the presence of multiple victims at approximately 10:45 a.m. Students at the nearby California State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB) campus, as well as two other elementary schools, were asked to shelter in place for an hour during the incident. The two injured students were transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC). One of them, identified as eight-year-old Jonathan Martinez, had to be airlifted, but he later died there. After his death, Martinez's family requested privacy, but also asked the media to raise awareness about a developmental disorder called Williams syndrome, which Martinez suffered from. The second injured student, identified as nine-year- old Nolan Brandy, was in stable condition, having been hit in the upper body, after initially described to be in critical condition. School officials said that Brandy was \\"recovering well\\" on April 13, and by the next day, he had been discharged from LLUMC to continue recovery at home. About 500‚Äì600 other students were in attendance at the time of the shooting. By about 12:00 p.m., they were all transported by bus to the CSUSB campus, then to the nearby Cajon High School. Aftermath The gun-control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety said that this shooting was the fourth intentional shooting in a K-12 campus in 2017, and the first to result in fatalities. North Park Elementary School was closed down, but eventually reopened on April 17. Plans were made to move Class B-1 out of the classroom and into another one. Grief counselors were available at Del Vallejo Middle School on April 11, the day after the shooting. A GoFundMe campaign was set up to pay for Martinez's funeral, and has since raised more than $120,000 as of April 13. Another GoFundMe campaign was set up to help Brandy's recovery in the hospital. On April 14, police released two recordings of 9-1-1 calls made during the shooting. =Investigation= Chief Jarrod Burguan said that Martinez and Brandy were standing behind their teacher when all three were shot, but that the boys were not targeted and may have merely been struck by stray bullets. However, one of the teacher's aides who witnessed the shooting said that the gunman intentionally attempted to shoot the other aide, but had run out of ammunition. Following the shooting, police searched the gunman's home. There, they found a handwritten note purportedly penned by the gunman; Chief Burguan said that it referenced the gunman's relationship with the teacher, but was not a suicide note outside the context of the shooting. He also said that the note referenced \\"needing closure and feeling disrespected and dishonored\\". They also recovered a computer and a phone from the home. A man, later identified as the gunman's brother, was interviewed in police custody and later released. =School security measures= Dale Marsden, the superintendent of San Bernardino City Unified School District, promised a reexamination of North Park Elementary School's security measures. The shooting also prompted schools in Montana to reexamine their own security measures. On April 13, Marsden announced that fingerprinted volunteers will be the only non-staff members allowed into North Park Elementary, and that the school district will review a possible larger application of that rule in the future. Perpetrator Cedric Anderson (1963 - April 10, 2017), a resident of Riverside, was identified as the perpetrator. He was in a four-year-long relationship with Karen Elaine Smith, the slain teacher, but the two were only married from January to March. Their marriage ended by separation. At the time of the shooting, he was unemployed and attempting to start his own business. He had a criminal history of weapons charges, accusations of domestic violence, and drug charges spanning from 1982 to 2013, but no convictions ever resulted from those arrests. These charges predated his marriage to Smith. Before meeting Smith, Anderson lived around Atlanta, Georgia; Las Vegas, Nevada; and other cities in Southern California. In the late 1990s or early 2000s, he participated in an expos√© by Las Vegas NBC affiliate KSNV on housing fees at Nellis Air Force Base. The report said that Anderson had been in the U.S. Navy for eight years and was married to a nineteen-year Air Force veteran who had been deployed to Pakistan. Cedric Anderson served in the U.S. Navy, completing RTC in San Diego in November 1983, company 153. After boot camp he became a Hull Technician. . Anderson went on to post a video of the expos√© on YouTube. =Domestic troubles= Anderson's history of domestic violence accusations was extensively documented in filings obtained by the New York Daily News. According to the filings, he had been married to another woman for eleven years before their marriage ended in 1996. In January 1997, the ex-wife filed a petition for a domestic violence restraining order against him. In the petition, she claimed that Anderson had threatened to kill her, their three sons, and himself, then later threatened to kidnap their children. In a follow-up filing, the woman claimed that Anderson had assaulted her in front of his sister after he dropped off their children. She reported the assault to police, but did not let officers arrest him in front of their sons. According to her, Anderson later \\"talked\\" her into dropping the restraining order, but continued to verbally abuse her afterwards. Their divorce was finalized later in 1997. In 2013, a former live-in girlfriend won a three-year restraining order after claiming that Anderson assaulted her on two occasions, one of which nearly killed her. Anderson had made frequent social media posts about his wife in the month preceding the attack, in which he depicted their relationship as loving and ignored their marital troubles. Smith's son from a previous relationship described Anderson as \\"paranoid and possessive\\", which was what led to his mother ending the marriage. According to Chief Burguan, Anderson had apparently contacted Smith before the shooting and tried to get her to return to him, and also made threats towards her that were not taken seriously. However, Smith's relatives said that she began staying at their homes in order to hide from him. A man recalled meeting Anderson at a gas station two weeks prior to the shooting. The man had been wearing a hat that caught Anderson's attention, and he confided in him about his troubled marriage and his frustration with Smith's family, who he blamed for their separation. He also claimed that he accidentally touched Smith's chest during an argument, and that Smith then accused him of choking her. The man said Anderson mentioned killing the Smith family during the conversation, which prompted him to invite him to his ministry. There, he and his wife made efforts to help him, but he acknowledged that he could not reach out to him more. Reactions Multiple American federal lawmakers released statements condemning the shooting and expressing their condolences to those affected. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos condemned the shooting as a \\"horrible act\\". White House officials called Mayor R. Carey Davis to convey President Donald Trump's \\"concern for [the] students and teachers\\". White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer mentioned the shooting during his regular press briefing, in which he called it \\"tragic and heartbreaking\\" and wished \\"a speedy and full recovery\\" for Brandy.

Once he left the finance industry, he created a newsletter and accompanying website that has become a primary source for investors looking for information related specifically to the objective measurement of sentiment data and education of investors.  Career  Goepfert founded Sundial Capital Research as a conduit for his research into behavioral finance. He consulted for numerous prominent hedge funds and Wall Street banks before creating a retail product and contributing to broadcasts for U.S. and overseas financial publications, radio and television on the CNN, Fox and CNBC networks. He has been interviewed or profiled in publications such as Traders, Stocks, Futures & Options, Futures and Independent Research magazines and spoken at numerous industry conferences for organizations such as the Market Technicians Association, National Association of Active Investment Managers and Minyanville Media. In 2004, Goepfert was awarded the Charles H. Dow Award for excellence in the field of technical analysis by the Market Technicians Association. In the weeks after the award was given, a member of the MTA noticed that the work was similar to that of Norman Fosback in the 1970s. A subsequent investigation revealed that neither Goepfert nor members of the award committee were aware of Mr. Fosback's work. The committee determined that the paper still advanced the field of technical analysis and investor sentiment, so a revised version of the paper was released, and the MTA changed the way that the award is reviewed in order to increase the likelihood that a committee member would be familiar with prior work in the field that is not necessarily widely published or cited.  Publications  Goepfert has been credited for advances in the fields of technical analysis or behavioral finance in a number of published books, academic journals and news media. = Books and Journals = * 2017: Chartered Market Technician, on the application of tracking general investor sentiment for market professionals. * 2016: Technical Analysis, on the use of granular data for the construction of popular indicators such as the put/call ratio. * 2014: Investing With The Trend, on recognizing the importance of market regimes in the application of sentiment data. * 2014: Financial Tracker, on the potential for Twitter as a source of social sentiment. * 2014: The New Trading For A Living, on the value of watching penny stock volume. * 2013: Algorithmic Finance, on the potential for Twitter for algorithmic finance * 2011: Time The Markets, on the application of cash balance as a reflection of sentiment. * 2010: Buy, Don't Hold, on the application of ETF data as a new tool. * 2009: Market Indicators, on using penny stock volume and mutual fund cash positions. * 2008: The Journal of Investing, on the use of market breadth in a time of structural change. * 2005: Trade Stocks & Commodities With The Insiders, on a way to use the data for stock index futures. = Patents = In 2007, he was used as a source in a patent filing for a unique way to monitor and express options trading activity. The patent was for a way of calculating and displaying the sentiment of options traders based on their opening transactions, and was based in part by a methodology outlined by Goepfert in a prior publication. = News Media = Goepfert is widely cited in U.S. financial media such as The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, The Financial Times, The Economist, The Washington Post, Forbes, The New York Times, Reuters, CBS News, CNN, FOX and CNBC and overseas publications such as Borsa & Finanza, Irish Times and The Telegraph for his outlook on markets or for background information on specific developments, indicators, or the general utility of using sentiment as a tool for investors.

The election used the 13 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with a total of 45 Councillors elected, an increase in 2 members from 2012. On 11 May, the Scottish Liberal Democrats ruled out entering into a formal coalition and instead would \\"consider every issue before the council on its merits on a case-by-case basis.\\" On 17 May, an agreement was reached to form a coalition between the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, the Scottish Labour Party, and three Independent (politician) councillors. The Tories had 11 seats, Labour contributed 9 and there were 3 independent members. This was after councillor Jennifer Stewart resigned from the Liberal Democrat group to sit as an Independent and give the coalition an overall majority. The coalition agreed by Aberdeen's Labour councillors was without the party executive's approval and so the councillors were told to withdraw from the deal by 5pm on 17 May or face suspension. The deadline passed without any change to the coalition and as such, all 9 Labour councillors were suspended from the party. In August, the co-leadership was ratified by a meeting of the full council, appointing Douglas Lumsden (Con) & Jenny Laing (Lab) as co-leaders.
