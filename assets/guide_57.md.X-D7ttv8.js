History During a time of crisis a Royal Duties Force would be formed. The force would be around 1,300 officers and men consisting of a reinforced battalion from one of the five regiments of Foot Guards, a reinforced squadron of the Household Cavalry equipped with armoured cars, a medical detachment, communications vehicles and other support and transport vehicles. It would be fully mobile and self- supporting for seven days. The force was capable of being split into four separate, self-supporting units to disperse key members of the Royal family to different locations. The plan had contingencies for different situations depending on the political situation and the amount of preparation time. * During the Precautionary Phase of the Government War Plan, the Royal family would disperse to country houses away from London. Known Royal residences such as Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House would not have been used. * Where there was sufficient time, the Royal family would be evacuated to sea. The royal yacht HMY Britannia was earmarked for this purpose and was planned to hide in the lochs of north west Scotland. * Where there was little warning time, the Royal family would be evacuated to the nearest regional seat of government. The Home Secretary and Duke of Edinburgh would remain with the Queen so they could hold a Privy Council and appoint a new Prime Minister if necessary. The plan was renamed Operation Synchronise in 1965 and in 1968 was absorbed into PYTHON, the plan to relocate the core of government to the Central Government War Headquarters at Corsham. Under this plan, the Queen would be moved to Corsham Court during the Precautionary Phase and then moved into the Central Government War Headquarters at short notice if necessary. It was withdrawn as a plan separate to PYTHON in 1973.

Their dramaturgy tends to focus on the oppression of women, on poverty, and race and imperialism. TOC Founding and Activism The Collective was founded in Kingston in 1977. The group was formed out of a Jamaican government program to help impoverished populations improve their job skills. Assisted by playwright and actor Honor Ford-Smith, the Collective performed their first play, Downpression Get a Blow, for a 1977 national worker's festival. The play was about conditions in a women's garment factory and the struggle to unionize against management opposition. Downpression Get a Blow established the Sistren Theatre Collective's focus on women's and labor issues. The term Sistren was chosen as a name for the group because it means 'sisters' or 'sisterhood,' and is particularly associated with Jamaica's rasta culture. Ford-Smith served as the Collective's first artistic director, but other founding members include: Vivette Lewis, Cerene Stephenson, Lana Finikin, Pauline Crawford, Beverley Hanson, Jasmine Smith, Lorna Burrell Haslam, Beverley Elliot, Jerline Todd, Lillian Foster, May Thompson, Rebecca Knowles, and Barbara Gayles. Most of these founding members were working class single mothers. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the Collective developed over a dozen plays and toured throughout the Caribbean, the U.S., and Europe. They also ran workshops and programs to promote awareness of women's issues and the arts. Today, the Collective runs education programs promoting education on women's and gender issues, grassroots activism and art, building regional networks, and campaigning for social change. Sistren serves adults, youth, and children in communities across Jamaica and the Caribbean. In promoting their social and economic justice initiatives, the Collective has worked with the Ministry of Health, UNICEF local office, Christian Aid, Global Fund, Global Board of Ministries, and United Church of Canada. From 1996 to the present they have run a Gender Justice-HIV/AIDS program in both rural and urban communities. Other causes include family therapy, a Male Leadership Development program, and a youth- centered Forum on Gang Violence. Themes, Style, and Language Much of the Collective's theatre work is rooted in their experiences as black Caribbean women, exploring the intersections between the patriarchal oppression of women, racism, and social class. Some of their most important thematic interests include: unemployment, domestic violence, alcoholism, harassment in the workplace, poverty and class oppression, racism, imperialism, sexism and women's social roles, and child-rearing and pregnancy. Many of the Collective's plays utilize Brechtian alienation to encourage audiences to critically understand how a particular situation came into being and how it might be improved. Ford-Smith explained that this style attempts to facilitate \\"change or consolidation through the revelation and understanding of forms of oppression and exploitation, forms of affirmation and celebration.\\" Jamaican performance, aesthetics, and folk culture are major influence on the Collective's work. Inspired by Caribbean playwrights and artists like Dennis Scott, the Collective utilizes songs, games, rituals, folklore, African stories, reggae, and other elements of Jamaican popular culture in their plays. Performances often rely heavily on dance, mime, and ritual. Nana Yah, about Jamaica's legendary heroine Nanny, is performed with a series of twelve vignettes or scenes, some of which include no dialogue but rely entirely on visual and musical performance. Jamaican reggae has been incorporated into musical plays like Muffet Inna All A We, which adapts the Little Miss Muffet nursery rhyme and the West African and Caribbean Anansi legends to critique international capitalism and consumer culture's affects on working-class women. Oral traditions and culture play a major role in the Sistren's performances, and more than many other Caribbean theatre artists the Collective incorporates Jamaican patois, the language of most black Jamaicans. Inspired in part by Louise Bennett, the Collective uses the rhythms, patterns, and structures of everyday speech to address popular audiences apart from normal middle class theatre-goers. However, the Collective often uses linguistic differences, especially between patois and standard English, to signal social class or social class pretensions. Improvisation and Play- Making Process Many of the Collective's early plays were developed out of loose improvisations based on the members' life experiences, including the early play Bellywoman Bangarang, about pregnancy. However, as the Collective developed, they began incorporating more outside sources, including archival material and interviews with women who had experienced the situations being dramatized in the plays. However, improvisation remains an important element in the Collective's production process, allowing an organic and democratic development of material. Over time, the Collective developed a flexible but regular process, which has become highly influential with community theatres throughout the Caribbean. They select a topic and a community, then collect as much material as possible with which to begin developing ideas. The researched material is molded through a workshop process involving games, improvisation, role-playing, and free form exploration. These free-flowing techniques eventually coalesce into a rough storyline, which is then transcribed into a skeleton script. One important aspect of the Sistren Theatre Collective's process is that they take the working script back to the community where the play is being set to gather input from those whose stories are being told. 'Witnessing,' or listening to personal testimony, is an important element of Jamaican culture and has influenced both Sistren's production process and their dramaturgy. Awards and Initiatives The play QPH won a National Theatre Critic's Award. The play reflects many of the Sistren Theatre Collective's dominant themes. It memorializes 167 women killed in a 1980 Kingston Alms House fire. The name QPH comes from the specific focus on characters Queenie, Pearlie, and Hopie, who are impoverished despite lifetimes of trying to survive economically as independent women. QPH uses the African Etu ritual, which is practiced in Jamaica, to resurrect the dead women to perform fragments of their lives. The Collective's anti-violence campaigns have been widely recognized. Along with five other NGOs, the Sistren contracted with the Ministry of National Security for the Citizen Security and Justice Programme (CSJP), an initiative to reduce violence in Jamaica. They also partnered with several other organizations on the JSIF Inner City Basic Services Project, led by the Dispute Resolution Foundation. Sistren received a UNHABITAT \\"Certificate of Recognition for Excellence in Urban Safety, Crime Prevention and Youth\\" in 2008.

He was the associate principal percussionist of the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1959 until his retirement in 1997. He is widely regarded as one of the most important percussion educators of the second half of the twentieth century, having taught at Temple University beginning in 1972. Abel's inventions include several unique and ubiquitous triangles and a bass drum stand that allowed the instrument to be suspended with the use of rubber bands. Early life and education Abel was born in Hobart, Indiana, in 1928. At the age of seven, he started percussion lessons. He studied with Clarence Carlson at the Roy Knapp School and then with Haskell Harr and William Street at the Eastman School of Music from 1947 to 1951, where he earned a performance degree and played part- time with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra.  Career  After enlisting and playing in the United States Air Force Band from 1951 to 1953, he performed with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic from 1953 to 1959. In 1959 he became a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra and remained there until the end of his career in 1997. He was named Associate Principal Percussionist of the orchestra in 1972. In 1998 he was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame. In 2012, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music by the New England Conservatory of Music. Abel was also a teacher at Rutgers University, Rowan University, and Temple University. = Musical instruments = Abel's predecessor at the Philadelphia Orchestra, James Valerio, had a custom-made triangle which was coveted by his peers. After lending it to Abel for the first two years, Abel devised a way to recreate the sound and created the \\"Alan Abel triangle\\", which uses a piece of chromed brass. Used because of its overtone-rich sound, the triangle has been manufactured since 1963. Abel also invented the \\"suspended\\" bass drum stand in the early 1960s, which he manufactured himself until 2013, when he handed manufacturing to Andrew Reamer, who had previously supplied the drums. The stand allows the bass drum to be suspended on a ring that swivels. The suspended bass drum stand is used by most American symphonic orchestras, and the concept has been copied and imitated by multiple drum hardware manufacturers worldwide.  Death  Abel died on April 25, 2020, of complications from COVID-19.

Abui people are spread across the districts of South Alor, East Alor, and Northwest Alor in Alor Regency. Abui people speak the Abui language, which is a Papuan (non-Austronesian) language, as well as Indonesian, and a Malay-based creole known as Alor Malay.  Etymology  The term Abui is an Abui word that means ‚Äòmountains‚Äô or alternatively ‚Äòenclosed place‚Äô. Abui people refer to themselves as , literally meaning 'the mountain people'. The bare term is often associated with the large mountain range in central Alor, , and is often contrasted to the smaller mountain range in the Kabola/Adang speaking area in the bird's head of Alor. The language is referred to as in the Takalelang variety (the most well-studied variety) and in the Welai, Mola, and Mainang varieties. The glossonym Abui was first introduced by Cora Du Bois in the late 1930s after the ethnonym was already in circulation. This ethnonym is also used in Alor Malay/Indonesian to refer to Abui speakers. The term Barawahing is a derogatory exonym meaning 'black, smelly, smoky.'  History  = Origins = According to Abui oral tradition, Abui people settled in Alor in ancient times and did not find other settlers there. Later some of them moved to the Kabola peninsula.Djeki, J.J. 1986. Penelitian suku terasing di Kabupaten Alor Abui. Proyek inventarisasi dan dokumentasi kebudayaan daerah Nusa Tenggara Timur. Kupang.Nicolspeyer, Martha Margaretha. 1940. De sociale structuur van een Aloreesche bevolkingsgroep. Rijswijk: Kramers. The same tradition accounts that they dwelled in caves in the mountains in the Mainang area. In this area also some rock art is found. Abui refer to neighbouring tribes as ‚Äòyounger siblings‚Äô or as ‚Äònew arrivals‚Äô. However, the oral tradition in Alor serves too often as a political instrument. The oral tradition has not been verified by archaeological research yet. = Ethnography = The American anthropologist Cora Du Bois studied and lived among Abui people from 1937-1939 in the village of Atimelang, resulting in the publication, The People of Alor.Du Bois, Cora Alice. 1960. The people of Alor; a social-psychological study of an East Indian island. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Around the same time, the Dutch sociologist Martha Margaretha Nicolspeyer published a study of the Abui social structure.  Culture  A man playing the gong for a ceremonial song and dance as an appreciation to the United States Navy for providing humanitarian assistance and medical aid to the locals affected by the November 2004 earthquake that struck Alor Island. Abui people from Takpala village engage in a traditional dance known as lego-lego, in which dancers move in a circular pattern. Gongs and mokos are also beaten. =Religion= The original religion of the inhabitants of Alor Islands was animistic until much later when Protestant missionaries arrived. Majority of the Alor Island communities are Christians, except for those living along the coast line tend to be Muslims as most of the Muslims living there migrated from other islands. The Abui people generally are predominantly Protestant. However, their beliefs have animistic influences as well. Catholic communities are found in Kalabahi and particularly among the Abui people in Takalelang and Mainang. There is also one Muslim Abui community, found in the coastal village of Nurdin.  Economy  = Agriculture = Abui speakers are mainly farmers, just like other inhabitants of Alor. However, in mountainous areas hunting and gathering is also an important supplement to the staple diet of corn, cassava, and rice. In the coastal areas, which are less favourable for agriculture, many farmers have switched to fishing, the traditional activity of the Austronesian population. Traditional livestock are pigs and chicken. However, livestock seldom supplement the diet due to frequent swine fever and poultry diseases. Thus, the diet is not well balanced, often resulting in poor health conditions and anaemia, especially among children and women. In the mountainous areas the situation is better as traditional hunting provides a more balanced diet. The mountains also favour a number of important cash crops such as tamarind, coconuts, coffee, cloves, cocoa, cashew nuts, candlenuts (Aleurites moluccana), vanilla, almonds (Canarium) and tobacco. These provide the farmers with additional income, which results in generally better living standards than for people in the coastal areas. = Tourism = The Takpala community performs a lego-lego dance for tourists. The Abui \\"traditional village of Takpala\\" (kampung tradisional Takpala) is a tourist destination consisting of a small cluster of traditional houses on a hillside. Visitors watch performances, pose for photographs in traditional attire, and buy handicrafts. In 1980, the Takpala Village won second place for most traditional village at the national level. There are also many Western researchers who would visit the village in order to study the culture, lifestyle and language of the Abui people. Ever since then, Takpala Village is considered a cultural heritage area by the Alor Regency and a tourist destination. Aside from cultural tourism, Alor Island is also known as a world class diving location. To date, there are 42 registered diving sites in Alor Island.  Education  Educational facilities in the Abui area are limited to elementary and secondary schools in district capitals. The nearest university is in Kalabahi, which offers limited training in economy, law, English and computer science. The more significant educational institutions are found in Kupang, the provincial capital of East Nusa Tenggara.

The church is located in close proximity to what Christian tradition holds to be the tomb of Lazarus and the site of the house of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.  History  In 1863, the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land gained title to a plot of ground close to the tomb of Lazarus. Other areas were acquired later.Bushell, Gerard OFM, Church of Saint Lazarus in Bethany , originally in: The Churches of Antonio Barluzzi, editor: Peter C. Nicholson, The McCabe Educational Trust, accessed 1 March 2018 Between 1952 and 1953 a modern church dedicated to St. Lazarus and designed by Italian architect Antonio Barluzzi was built on this property. Description The modern Roman Catholic church stands the eastern part of the remnants of the former Byzantine and Crusader churches. The courtyard of this church stands over the west end of the older churches. Parts of the original mosaic floor are still visible here. The west wall of the courtyard contains the west facade of the 6th-century basilica, as well as its three doorways. Its interior is decorated at presbyterium with mosaic depicting Mary, Martha and Lazarus, with polished stone and mosaics. The designs for the mosaics of the church were done by Cesare Vagarini. The work itself was carried out by the Monticelli company of Rome, which was also responsible for the mosaic decoration in Barluzzi's churches at Mount Tabor (the Church of the Transfiguration) and the Gethsemane Garden (the Church of All Nations). = Tomb = About twenty-five metres up a hill northwest of the church is the modern entrance to the traditional tomb of Lazarus. The church has a cruciform plan and stands over the east end of the older churches. \\"Its walls are almost hermetically sealed and windowless. The dome is solidly incorporated into [the] octagonal drum overhead. All this suggests a subterranean vault, lonely as a grave... The soaring higher elements, crowned by the dome with its flood of light, suggests the joy of intense hope and optimism. Visitors can view parts of the apse of the ancient \\"Lazarium\\" through trapdoors in the floor, just inside the main entrance. A staircase leads to a rock grave with a tiny entry and open window. =Saint= The church is named after the West Bank town of al-Eizariya, identified with biblical Bethany. This refers to the biblical angel of Bethany, referred to by her title of Holy Divine angel.  Monastery  The archaeological excavations uncovered the rest of the foundations of the Crusader monastery of French Franciscan sisters of 12th to 13th century. The sisters bred sheep, grew fruit and olives. Their olive press and mill-wheel are shown in a permanent exhibition in a basement of their building.

Background Following the report of the Strath Committee in 1955, the British government developed contingency plans for the continuity of government. This included construction of the Central Government War Headquarters (CGWHQ), codenamed BURLINGTON, at Corsham. As planned, it would have been a \\"reserve Whitehall\\" where the central government could be moved in an emergency and, hopefully, survive a nuclear attack. As nuclear weapons became more powerful and intercontinental ballistic missiles became more of a threat than manned bombers, the concept of concentrating central government in a single location became flawed. Instead government would be dispersed around the country with just core functions at CGWHQ. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 prompted a radical rethink of continuity plans. Part of the thinking was that the Precautionary Period ahead of nuclear war, or a conventional war in Europe culminating in nuclear war, might only last 2-3 days rather than the 7 days originally planned, so it would not be possible to fully staff CGWHQ with 4,000 people in time. PYTHON became active on 1 May 1968 and described in the 1968 update to the Government War Book.CAB 21/5655 Government War Book, The National Archives Locations Sites for dispersing government were selected in 1966 based on their existing accommodation, independence from the national power and water grids, nuclear fallout protection and distance from likely targets. The chosen sites were RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, HMS Osprey in Dorset, Taymouth Castle (then the Civil Defence Corps Training School) in Scotland and either the helicopter support ship RFA Engadine or royal yacht HMY Britannia which would embark a PYTHON group at Loch Torridon or Oban. Tonfanau Army Camp was temporarily designated as the PYTHON location for Wales with a view to moving the site to the Old College at Aberystwyth University (which housed the University's Department of Physics) as soon as possible. Each dispersed PYTHON group would be supported by dispersed sections of the United Kingdom Supply Agency and the National Air Transport Agency. In addition, in 1964 the Secretary of State for Scotland ordered three ships - MV Hebrides, MV Clansman and RMS Columba - which were chartered to David MacBrayne Ltd as car ferries but could be converted to floating nuclear bunkers in a very short time. They had heavy steel doors to seal the car deck, air tight external windows and doors, decontamination rooms with showers and external sprinklers to wash away fallout. One or more of these ships would have accompanied RFA Engadine or HMY Britannia from Oban or Mallaig. The Corsham bunker, given the new codename TURNSTILE from 1963 and CHANTICLEER from 1970, would play an important part in the lead up to war but ceased to have a CGWHQ role other than as a possible aggregation point for PYTHON groups some time after an attack.

It is larger than Odontomachus troglodytes, with a petiolar node that is higher and more compressed. The labial palps have four segments. The colouring varies across its large range, with most forms being some shade of brown, with brown femurs and yellowish legs. Individuals from Ghana tend to have red heads, and those from Guinea have yellow femurs and shiny black propodeums. Distribution and habitat O. assiniensis is native to sub-Saharan Africa. Its range extends from Guinea, Ghana, Cameroun and the Congo to Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. It is a terrestrial forest species being found mainly in tropical rainforest and also in other moist forests, swamp forests and evergreen forests. Ecology This terrestrial species is found on the forest floor, among leaf litter, in rotten logs, under stones and fallen timber. Nests have been reported from such places as the inside of dead wood lying on the ground, and in one instance, in the soil in coarse grassland. This nest had multiple entrances and was about in diameter. In this species, unmated workers can lay eggs, and these always develop into males. These ants are predators, their diet mostly consisting of termites, but also including other small insects captured on the surface of the ground. Larger prey is stung but smaller prey is killed by a snap of the jaws.

Sponsorships Beginning in 1995, Star Banc Corporation started to sponsor the annual Star Bank LPGA Classic golf tournament that was held at the Country Club of the North in Beavercreek, Ohio. Corporate sponsorship continued after Star Banc acquired Firstar and changed the name of the bank to Firstar in late 1998; the golf tournament continued under the new Firstar name in 1999. Corporate sponsorship was dropped in 2001 after Firstar acquired U.S. Bancorp that same year. In April 1997, Star Bank became the official bank of the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds replaced this sponsorship in August 2000 with a new business relationship with Provident Bank (through successive mergers, Provident became a part of National City and later PNC with each successor continuing the sponsorship).

It began on March 20, 2017 in Kourou, and spread all over French Guiana within a few days. Several international rocket and satellite launches were postponed, and March 28 saw the largest demonstration ever held in French Guiana. The protesters asked for more resources, and demanded an investment in infrastructure from the mainland government of ‚Ç¨1 billion. The mainland government turned down and offered a government pledge of ‚Ç¨1 million in infrastructure.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39557670 Labor union leaders and three local politicians occupied the Guiana Space Centre on April 4‚Äì5, 2017. Supermarkets no longer sold fresh products due to road blocks in April 2017. The strikes became an issue in the 2017 French presidential election. Context French Guiana is fraught with tensions between different communities (indigenous peoples, descendants of African slaves, immigrants from Brazil, Suriname and Haiti, and Europeans) as well as an economic crisis and a rise in insecurity. Per capita income at ‚Ç¨15,000 is lower than mainland France; the unemployment rate is 23 percent and more than 40 percent for 18-to-25-year-olds; the cost of living is higher than in mainland France due to the need to import most goods and EU-sanctioned tariffs with neighboring Brazil and Suriname; foreign nationals are 35 percent as opposed to 6.5 percent in mainland France; and the murder rate is the highest anywhere in France with 42 homicides in 2016. Moreover, the consumption of illicit drugs like cannabis, cocaine and crack, is very high. Cayenne is also a hub of drug- trafficking; in 2016, 371 drug-traffickers were arrested on flights to Europe. Strikes The strikes are led by the \\"Collective of 500 Brothers\\", a group of men who wear balaclavas. They are meant to expose the rise in insecurity, the deterioration of access to health care, the rise in illicit gold placer mining, and illegal immigration. The strikes began in Kourou on March 20, 2017, to oppose the privatization of a hospital run by the Red Cross and the rise in insecurity. Within a few days, they spread to Cayenne and Saint- Laurent-du-Maroni, followed by Maripasoula and Papaichton. Protesters blocked roads, which led to the cancellation of flights from the Cayenne ‚Äì F√©lix Ebou√© Airport to Paris. It also led to the postponement of the launch of an Ariane 5 rocket with SGDC's Brazilian satellite and the KT Corporation's Koreasat-7 South Korean satellite. By March 23, 2017, the campus of the University of French Guiana as well as schools, administrative buildings and the harbour were closed. Meanwhile, French Guianans bought food in bulk, and muggings were reported. March 28 was dubbed a \\"dead day\\" by local media, with everything closed. There were between 8,000 and 10,000 demonstrators in Cayenne and between 3,500 and 4,000 in Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, leading the prefecture of French Guiana to call it \\"the largest demonstration ever held in French Guiana.\\" The demonstrators carried the flag of French Guiana and placards reading \\"Nou bon k√© sa\\", which means \\"enough is enough\\" in Guianan Cr√©ole. They were asking the French government for more resources. On April 3, 2017, as rocket launches from the Guiana Space Centre was suspended, \\"Europe's first high-power, all-electric satellite\\", Eutelsat's Eutelsat-172b, was returned to the Airbus factory near Toulouse until further notice. Additionally, the launch of the $625 million ViaSat-2 internet satellite, scheduled for April 25, was postponed. On April 4, 2017, another demonstration was held in Kourou. In the evening, 30 labour union leaders visited the Guiana Space Centre to meet its director, Didier Faivre, and began to occupy the premises until their demands are met. Alongside the 30 union leaders are three politicians: Gabriel Serville, a member of the National Assembly for the Guianese Socialist Party; Antoine Karam, a member of the French Senate for the Socialist Party; and L√©on Bertrand, the mayor of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. As of April 5, 2017, the protesters decided to wait inside until the arrival of the president of the National Centre for Space Studies, Jean-Yves Le Gall, scheduled for April 6, 2017. However, they left the premises on April 5, 2017. On April 7, 2017, protesters were waiting to meet the prefect of French Guiana, Martin Jaeger, but their appointment was cancelled. As a result, a violent protest took place outside the building of the prefecture in Cayenne. Tear gas was used by the police. Meanwhile, one policeman was seriously injured during the protest. The following day, on April 8, 2017, members of the Collective of 500 Brothers visited him in hospital to find common ground. As of April 7, supermarkets had run out of fresh products due to the road blocks. In particular, bottled water, milk, flour and meat were no longer available. On April 21, the French government signed an agreement with protesters authorizing an emergency relief of up to 2.1 billion euros, which includes funds for security, education, healthcare, and business aid. Roadblocks were removed the following day, and operations at the Kourou space center resumed on April 24. Reactions On March 24, 2017, the United States Department of State advised their citizens against visiting French Guiana due to the unrest. On March 25, 2017, Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve called for a return to peace and dialogue. Three days later, on March 28, 2017, ministers Matthias Fekl and Ericka Bareigts visited French Guiana. They pledged a ‚Ç¨1 billion investment in infrastructure. The offer was turned down by the protesters, who asked for a \\"special status\\" on April 2, 2017 and a ‚Ç¨2.5 billion \\"aid package\\" on April 3, 2017. On April 3, 2017, Prime Minister Cazeneuve said that ‚Ç¨2.5 billion was \\"unrealistic\\". On April 5, 2017, Socialist Senator Georges Patient demanded ‚Ç¨3.2 billion to build schools and hospitals. The same day, the French government agreed to build more schools and a new police station in Cayenne. Meanwhile, the local chapter of the Mouvement des Entreprises de France called for an end to the road blocks. As the strikes were happening in the midst of the campaign for the 2017 French presidential election, several candidates commented on it. For example, Fran√ßois Fillon blamed the situation on President Fran√ßois Hollande's failed policies, while Marine Le Pen blamed it on illegal immigration.

History The Murray, a clipper of 1,019 tons B.M. and 902 tons register, length , breadth and depth , was built in 1861 by Alexander Hall & Co. in Aberdeen, Scotland for the packet service of James Thompson & Co. of London, the first ship built for that company, better known as the Orient Line, the last of their ships to be built entirely of wood. She was launched on 25 May 1861, her first master being the highly regarded Captain Legoe, whose wife gave her the name of \\"The Murray\\". She sailed from Gravesend on her first voyage to Australia in July 1861. She carried both passengers and cargo, making very fast times. In 1863 she left Plymouth on 15 July and arrived at Adelaide on 26 September, making the entire journey in 73 days, equal to the 1860 record of , considered the fastest on the route until the advent of . Captain Legoe, previously of Celestial, was succeeded by James Norval Smart in 1867, William Begg 1869‚Äì1872, previously of Sebastian and , and Thomas L. Wadham 1874‚Äì1876. On the night of 26 May 1870 in mid Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa, a lookout saw a ship on fire, and Begg made towards it. The ship was the Italian barque Mannin Barabino, out of Genoa bound for the River Plate (Puerto Rico) with a cargo of spirits. The fire had started in the galley and swiftly engulfed the ship; the ship's boat was lowered but was soon overloaded and capsized, and the few survivors managed by clinging to the upturned boat or floating spars, and over 120 were lost by fire or water. Captain Begg was awarded a silver medal by the Italian government for his part in the rescue.

The company has customers and partners in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. simPRO offices are located in each of these countries, with the more recent opening for operation in Colorado in the United States.  History  simPRO was founded in 2002, after electrical business owner Steve Bradshaw approached software engineering student Vaughan McKillop about creating a website for his electrical contracting business. When McKillop explained to Bradshaw that his strengths lay in writing software rather than web design, the two men created simPRO's first iteration using web-based PHP and MySQL languages. Initially they focused on making digital job lists, and then moved on to building a scheduling tool that could allocate time and technicians. As McKillop and Bradshaw continued to expand on the software's capability and functionality, they realised that the new tool could also be offered to other customers. The company first started trading as Acorn Software and Service Management Pty Ltd in 2003, then changed its name is simPRO Software in 2011 and simPRO in 2017.  Management  As at February, 2019, the simPRO Board of Management and Executive Team has five members: Chief Executive Officer Sean Diljore, Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer Alan Bignell, Chief Technology Officer Jonathan Eastgate, Executive Financial Controller Rhiza Lahoylahoy and Chief Learning and Development Officer Erika Entz. Peter Darley is currently General Manager for simPRO Australia, and Ricky Sevta is General Manager simPRO New Zealand. In 2009, simPRO was launched in the United Kingdom and its current General Manager is Richard Pratley, who previously managed the New Zealand office. In 2015, the company opened a location in Colorado, United States.  Investors  In October 2016, simPRO received USD$31 million in capital funding from New York-based growth equity firm Level Equity. It marked the first time the company has accepted external investment since its founding. Level Equity Partner Benjamin Levin and Principal Charles Chen now sit on the simPRO Board of Directors.  Mergers and acquisitions  In 2013, simPRO acquired vehicle fleet tracking and management company simTRAC for AUD$2.5 million, which is designed to help business managers monitor their work vehicles on the road in real time and minimise travel times.

He was born in western Iran. He was held in the Australian-run Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea from 2013 until its closure in 2017. He remained on the island before being moved to Port Moresby along with the other detainees around September 2019. On 14 November 2019 he arrived in Christchurch, New Zealand on a one-month visa, to speak at a special event organised by WORD Christchurch on 29 November, as well as other speaking events. In December 2019, his one month visa to New Zealand expired. It has been confirmed that Boochani has not left New Zealand, and remained on an expired visa until being granted refugee status in July 2020. As of July 2020, Boochani is to become a Senior Adjunct Research Fellow at the University of Canterbury.https://www.chrislynchmedia.com/newsitems/Cantyuniupdate?fbclid=IwAR1x5i_rMG0Ef2lSwU8Z7LQJjIy_2Vmz7gh-Q1_WU9vQU0-Te- CxdXuMRpA Boochani is the co-director, along with Iranian film maker Arash Kamali Sarvestani, of the documentary Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time, has published numerous articles in leading media internationally about the plight of refugees held by the Australian government on Manus Island, and has won several awards. His memoir, No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison, won the Victorian Prize for Literature and the Victorian Premier's Prize for Nonfiction in January 2019. The book was tapped out on a mobile phone in a series of single messages over time and translated from Persian into English by Omid Tofighian. Life =In Iran= Boochani was born in Ilam, Iran in 1983. He has described himself as \\"a child of war\\", referring to the 1980s war between the Iraqi Ba'athists and \\"Iranian zealots\\" fought largely in his Kurdish homeland in western Iran. He graduated from Tarbiat Modares University and the Tarbiat Moallem University (now named Kharazmi University), both in Tehran, with a master's degree in political science, political geography and geopolitics. He began his journalistic career writing for the student newspaper at Tarbiat Modares University, before working as a freelance journalist for several Iranian newspapers such as Kasbokar Weekly, Qanoon, and Tehran-based Etemaad as well as the Iranian Sports Agency. He wrote articles on Middle East politics, minority rights and the survival of Kurdish culture. In secret, he taught children and adults a particular Kurdish dialect from the region of Ilam, regarded as their mother tongue. He co- founded and produced the Kurdish magazine Werya (also spelt Varia), which he regarded as his most important work, and which attracted the attention of the Iranian authorities because of its political and social content. The magazine promoted Kurdish culture and politics; Boochani felt it very important for the Kurdish city of Ilam to retain its Kurdish identity, language and culture. As a member of the Kurdish Democratic party, outlawed in Iran, and the National Union of Kurdish Students, he was watched closely. In February 2013, the offices of Werya were raided by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was founded after the 1979 revolution to protect the country's Islamic Republic system and to quell uprisings of \\"deviant movements\\", and had previously threatened Boochani with detention. Boochani was not in the office that day, but 11 of Boochani's colleagues were arrested, several of whom were subsequently imprisoned. After publishing news of the arrests online and the news spreading globally, Boochani went into hiding for three months and on 23 May 2013, fled Iran and made his way to Indonesia via Southeast Asia. =In detention= In July 2013, on his second attempt to make a crossing from Indonesia to Australia in a boat carrying 60 asylum seekers, the boat was intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy. Boochani and his fellow asylum seekers were detained first on Christmas Island and after one month transferred to the Manus Island detention centre in August 2013, as part of Australia's Pacific Solution II, known as Operation Sovereign Borders. Manus is where the Australian government detains single male refugees, whose maritime arrivals are six times more numerous than that of women. Boochani started making contact with journalists and human rights defenders outside the camp. He gathered information about human rights abuses within the camp and sent them via a secreted mobile phone to news organisations and advocacy groups such as The Guardian, The Sydney Morning Herald, the Refugee Action Collective, and the United Nations. In September 2015, PEN International (the Melbourne and Norwegian branches of which Boochani is now an honorary member) and a coalition of human rights groups launched an international campaign on Boochani's behalf, urging the Australian government to abide by its obligations to the principle of non-refoulement, as defined by Article 33 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Several campaigns have urged individuals to write to Peter Dutton, Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian Prime Minister and high commissioners. Reporters without Borders warned that dissent was not tolerated by Iran's theocratic regime, and that Boochani's \\"freedom would be in great danger if he were forced to return to Iran\\". Boochani has asked repeatedly to be handed to the UN. He also became a spokesperson for the men in his compound, Foxtrot, meeting with PNG immigration and other officials as well as Amnesty International and the UNHCR representatives. He was moved to Chauka, the solitary confinement block constructed of shipping containers, for three days. He was also jailed during the 2015 hunger strike that was put down by force; he spent eight days inside Lorengau prison and was then released without charge after being asked to stop reporting. He said in a radio interview on Autonomous Action Radio ahead of the release of his film Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time in 2016 that it was his intention to show the Australian public what the government was doing to detainees on the island, and spoke of the mental torture caused by being deprived of hope. (Download available) In March 2017, Boochani's plight was raised in the Australian House of Representatives by Australian parliamentarian Adam Bandt. Although forcibly moved to accommodation outside the detention centre some weeks after it was officially closed on 31 October 2017, Boochani could not leave the island without travel documents. The only way to reach the nearby town of Lorengau is on an official bus, and the refugees are routinely body-searched when they leave and return. He wrote of what was happening and of his fear during the siege that followed the closure, as well as the articles he wrote for The Guardian at the time, among other things, in WhatsApp messages to translator and friend Omid Tofighian, later published in full. On 28 November 2017, Boochani sent a message to the Australian public via the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) which was published on their website, thanking them for their humanity, and describing the recent peaceful protest by refugees on the island after the closure of the detention centre, which was met with force. He said that Peter Dutton was not correct in saying that their only desire was to come to Australia; they only want freedom and safety in any safe country, and they were not free nor safe on Manus. In a speech delivered to guests at a Human Rights Law Centre dinner in 2018, he expressed the view that the Australian Government was manipulating its people, using propaganda that centres on national security. In a radio interview with SBS Radio, he thanked the \\"many brave people in Australia who have been fighting against this system\\", saying that Australian people are not cruel and were they fully aware of what is exactly happening, they would not have let their government do this. Boochani was featured as the subject of ABC TV's Australian Story. He said that he would not be following through with resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and now regrets his decision to aim for Australia. =Freedom= On 14 November 2019, Boochani left Manus and travelled to New Zealand on a one-month visa to speak at the WORD Christchurch festival in Christchurch. Boochani said upon arrival that he was savouring life as a \\"free man\\". The US has technically accepted him as part of the ‚Äúrefugee swap‚Äù deal, but now that he has left PNG, he fears that his status is uncertain. If the US offer is revoked, he will look at the possibilities of applying to another country. Boochani feels a sense of duty towards the men he was forced to leave behind on PNG. Apart from those who have died, he said about that three-quarters of the refugees and asylum seekers sent to the Manus camp since 2012 have left, to Australia, the US or other countries. However he is deeply concerned that some remain trapped there, especially the 46 who are being held in Bomana prison in Port Moresby. Still in New Zealand in late February 2020, Boochani, responding to Peter Dutton's comment that he would never be allowed into Australia, said that he has never said that he wanted to go to Australia. It was not yet known whether he had applied for asylum in New Zealand. On 24 July 2020, the New Zealand Government granted refugee status to Boochani, allowing him to stay in New Zealand indefinitely and to apply for a residency visa. On that day it was also announced that Boochani had been appointed a Senior Adjunct Research Fellow of the University of Canterbury, based at KƒÅ Waimaero, the NgƒÅi Tahu Research Centre. Works from Manus Island While living in the Manus Island detention centre Boochani has had many of his articles published by online news and other media, such as \\"The Day My Friend Hamid Kehazaei Died\\" in The Guardian and \\"Life on Manus: Island of the Damned\\" in The Saturday Paper, and others by HuffPost, Financial Times, and the New Matilda. Guardian journalist Ben Doherty, upon accepting the Amnesty International Australia award on Behrouz's behalf in 2017, said that Boochani \\"...rightly, sees himself as a working journalist on Manus Island, whose job it is to be bear witness to the injustices and the violence and the privation of offshore detention\\". Some of his articles have been published on Kurdish websites in Iran. He has also published poems online and narrates his story in the award- winning animated short documentary film Nowhere Lines: Voices of Manus Island, made by UK film-maker Lucas Schrank in 2015).In 2017 he was the subject and co-producer of the award-winning Until We Are All Free, a graphic narrative in collaboration with Positive/Negatives and illustrator, Alex Mankiewicz. The film Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time was shot inside the Manus Island detention centre by Boochani, entirely on a mobile phone, and released on 11 June 2017 at the Sydney Film Festival. A review of the film was written by the award winning writer Arnold Zable. In February 2018, he wrote an article about the murder of his friend Reza Barati during riots at the camp in 2014 and the injustice of the events that followed. Included is a poem about his \\"gentle giant and best friend\\", called Our Mothers, a poem for Reza. Poem translated by Omid Tofighian. In March 2018 the full-length documentary film, Stop the Boats! (the title reflecting a government slogan), directed by Simon V. Kurian, was released, featuring Boochani and others. =No Friend But the Mountains= In July 2018, his memoir No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison was published by Picador. Written in prose and poetry, it chronicles his boat journey from Indonesia, his detainment on Manus Island and the lives (and deaths) of other prisoners, as well as observations on the Australian guards and the local Papuan people. The book was laboriously tapped out on a mobile phone in Persian in fragments via WhatsApp and translated from the Persian to English by his friend Omid Tofighian. He posits that the prison is a Kyriarchal system (a term borrowed from feminist theory), one where different forms of oppression intersect; oppression is not random but purposeful, designed to isolate and create friction amongst prisoners, leading to despair and broken spirits. In his foreword to the work, Australian writer Richard Flanagan refers to Boochani as \\"a great Australian writer\\". No Friend But the Mountains won the Victorian Prize for Literature and the Victorian Premier's Prize for Nonfiction on 31 January 2019. There were questions about Boochani's eligibility for both prizes because entrants had been previously limited to Australian citizens or permanent residents, but he was given an exemption by prize administrators and the judges were unanimous in recognising its literary excellence. Wheeler Centre director Michael Williams said that the judges thought that the story of what's happening on Manus Island essentially is an Australian story, and that \\"made it completely consistent with the intention of the awards\\". In an interview with the writer Arnold Zable following the award, Boochani said that he has many conflicting thoughts on it, but he sees it as a \\"political statement from the literary and creative arts community in Australia, and all those who do not agree with the government's thinking\\". In April 2019 the book was given a Special Award in the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, whose judges called it \\"an outstanding work of literature in its own right\\", apart from being \\"...remarkable for the circumstances of its production...[and]...compelling and shocking content\\". On 2 May, it was announced that the work had won the Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for General non-fiction book of the year. A film of the book is due to be made in 2021, shot mainly in Australia. Boochani said the new film should incorporate some of his previous work, and that of his fellow asylum seekers, as a record of part of Australian history. The film is to be directed by Rodd Rathjen and has been announced as one of the projects selected for the virtual 15th Ontario Creates International Financing Forum (iff) in association with Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Rathjen will work in close collaboration with Boochani (who takes on the roles of story consultant and associate producer) and writer and producer √Åkos Armont. =Remain (video installation)= Boochani collaborated with Iranian-born Melbourne photographer Hoda Afshar on a two-channel video work, Remain, which includes spoken poetry by him and Iranian poet Bijan Elahi. Afshar describes her method as \\"staged documentary\\", in which the men on the island are able to \\"re-enact their narratives with their own bodies and [gives] them autonomy to narrate their own stories.\\" The video was shown as part of the Primavera 2018 exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney, from 9 November 2018 to 3 February 2019. Both Afshar and Boochani believe that art can hit home in a more powerful way, after the public has become immune to images of and journalism about suffering. Writing about an award-winning portrait of himself by Afshar taken as part of the Remain project, Boochani says that the project would be part of the creation of a \\"new artistic language that is not beholden to the framework of colonialism\\", and in accordance with the \\"Manus Prison Theory\\". See also his reference to Kyriarchal system in No Friend But the Mountains. =Manus (play)= Boochani is one of the subjects of, as well as chief collaborator on, the play Manus written by playwright Nazanin Sahamizadeh in 2017, which tells the story of eight Iranians who fled Iran for Australia. It relates the stories of their lives in Iran and their experiences in detention on Manus, including details of the riot in February 2014, which led to the murder of one of them, Reza Barati, by locals. It was performed in Tehran in February‚ÄìMarch 2017, running for a month in the Qashqai Hall of the City Theatre Complex and attended by nearly 3000 people, including Abbas Araghchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, and Australian diplomats. It was also performed in two cities in Bangladesh in October 2017, at the Chittagong Shilpakala Academy in Chittagong and in Dhaka. The playwright Sahamizadeh said it was performed there as a part of its international tour to express compassion and solidarity with Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who had sought protection in Bangladesh recently. It will be directed by the author and produced by the Verbatim Theatre Group at the Adelaide Festival in March 2019.

She next served in Russia as the training ship Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna on the Black Sea, then returned to England where she was re-christened Silvana. History Hesperus was a sailing ship built by Robert Steele & Company of Glasgow in Greenock, Scotland in 1873 under the supervision of John Legoe for Thompson & Anderson's \\"Orient Line\\" as a replacement for Yatala, Legoe master, which was wrecked off the coast of France. She was an iron-hulled full-rigged ship of 1,777 tons register, length , beam , depth . She had been built especially for the South Australian trade route, and her first contract was to carry some 340 immigrants to Adelaide, with John Legoe in command. Some enterprising individual managed to produce a slim newspaper The Hesperian of modest pretensions during the voyage. Her last voyage under Captain Legoe brought his family to settle in South Australia: his wife Grace, daughter Grace and sons John, Glen and William, who were all to make a mark as citizens of the young colony. She left London on 18 July 1877 and arrived in Adelaide shortly before 15 October. Other passengers on that voyage were Col. Downes, for many years military commandant in Adelaide, and subsequently in Victoria, and C. Angel, later an Adelaide stockbroker. Capt. Thomas Row Harry was sent out by the Orient Company in 1877 to take charge of the Hesperus on the return voyage. The ship's log book, the last prepared by the captain, was a prized possession of Glen Legoe. Captain Harry succeeded Legoe as master of Hesperus, and in February 1886 married Jane Louisa Heywood; two days later embarked on his last voyage before settling in St Ives, Cornwall. Around 1890 Hesperus left the \\"Orient Line\\" for the \\"Australian Line\\" of Devitt & Moore, serving as a sail training vessel, John Howard Barrett in command. Barrett died in 1899 as captain of Devitt & Moore's Illawarra. In 1899 Hesperus changed hands again, to the Russian government and, renamed Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, served on the Black Sea as a sail training vessel, based in Odessa. In 1921 she returned to Great Britain, and once again as \\"Silvana\\" entered the maritime service. She did not however live up to her reputation as a \\"flyer\\", and made disappointing times; whether due to the ageing ship, a less aggressive captain, or less responsive crew will never be known.

The first popular and a local singer on the last half of the 60s, the other as jazz musician and singer respectively the Victoria Jazz Band and Roshna Jazz Band, for a total of two decades, and the third as a composer, arranger, lyricist, performer and interpreter of his own and other lyrics. He is filled with musical genes from Telemark, Numedal and Setesdal, where well known fiddlers can be traced in the genus. Olsen has contributed on a wide range of jazz and folk festivals in Norway and other Nordic countries.

Known for his research on vitamin D deficiency, Goswami is an elected fellow of National Academy of Sciences, India and Indian Academy of Sciences. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 2008.  Biography  AIIMS Delhi Ravinder Goswami, after earning his bachelor's degree in medicine from Maulana Azad Medical College, continued at the institution to complete his MD and secured a DM in endocrinology from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. He did his post-doctoral work by joining AIIMS in 1992, working under Narayana Panicker Kochupillai and has since been associated with the institution. In between, he had two sabbaticals; first at the University of Newcastle under Patricia Crock and later, at Harvard Medical School at the laboratory of Edward M. Brown. At AIIMS, he served as the sub-dean of research during 2011‚Äì13 and is a professor at the department of endocrinology and metabolism. Goswami lives in East AIIMS campus, in New Delhi.  Legacy  Goswami's studies have been focusing focused on clinical endocrinology and he has carried out research on diseases such as hypocalcemia and idiopathic hypoparathyroidism. His studies on vitamin D deficiency covered etiopathogenesis and gravity of the disorder across the population and his work was the first of its kind in India. His research revealed that vitamin D deficiency among Indian population is due to their dark skin (which prevented formation of vitamin D by blocking ultra violet rays) as well as inhibition of over-expression of Calcitriol receptor gene, resulting in inadequate bio-adaptation. He advocated against treating the nutritional deficiency through supplements and advised exposure to sunlight as a remedial measure. His work on idiopathic hypoparathyroidism assisted in widening the understanding of the disease with regard to its clinical signs such as parathyroid spondyloarthropathy, basal ganglia calcification and development of hyperphosphatemia. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles of which many have been listed by online article repositories such as Google Scholar and ResearchGate. Besides, he has contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has drawn citations from other authors. He has also presented his research at medical forums including the National Symposium on Nutrition and Bone Health of Nutrition Foundation of India held in 2007. and serves as an editorial associate for the Annals of the National Academy of Medical Sciences (India).  Awards and honors  The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded Goswami the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 2008. The Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow the same year and he became an elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India in 2010.

In this episode, when Gideon sends Hook out of Storybrooke, the pirate must find a way to return to Emma, who is being tempted to join Regina and Snow during a ladies' night out, while the origins behind the disappearance of Agrabah are revealed. Plot =Opening sequence= Jasmine's flying carpet is seen in the forest. =Event chronology= The Agrabah events take place after \\"The Savior\\" and the Once Upon a Time in Wonderland episode \\"Trust Me\\", and after Prince Eric left for Agrabah in \\"Ariel\\". The Enchanted Forest events take place after \\"Broken Heart\\" and after Jasmine and Aladdin left Storybrooke in \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and after the Once Upon a Time in Wonderland episode \\"And They Lived...\\". The Storybrooke events take place after \\"Page 23.\\" =In the characters' past= \\"Many years ago\\" in Agrabah, Jasmine's father, the Sultan, is looking for suitors for his daughter, and Jafar answers the request, except he has an ultimatum: if Jasmine doesn't accept his hand in marriage, Agrabah will be destroyed by sunset. Later on, while chasing down a thief, Jasmine runs into Ariel, who is looking for Prince Eric. Believing that finding Eric will bring his army to protect her Kingdom from Jafar, Jasmine and Ariel team up and track down Eric via Jasmine's magic carpet, only to discover that Prince Eric was actually Jafar in disguise. Ariel suggests that Jasmine use a vial of powder she stole from Jafar to defeat him, but Jafar uses his magic to send Ariel and the vial back to the sea. Towards the beginning of sunset, Jasmine agreed to marry Jafar, in exchange for sparing the lives of her people. She hands him the ring, but Jafar soon reveals that he never really wanted to rule Agrabah, since its people had always scorned him. He was actually interested in the ring, which contained the magic jewel that powered Agrabah's protection spell. He then uses it to cast a curse to make Agrabah disappear, \\"out of human reach\\". =In the Enchanted Forest (present day)= As the Nautilus is submerged into another realm, Nemo and Liam inform Hook that Gideon has taken the blood of the Kraken that was needed to return to Storybrooke, so Hook suggests that they hunt down the squid. At the same time, Jasmine and Aladdin search for Agrabah, when she discovers a ring in her pocket after she had wished to find Agrabah. They later continue the journey on boat, when they come across the Kraken, and are saved by Hook. It turned out that the compass from the Nautilus can lead them to a person whose heart is filled with revenge. This gives Hook an idea to help track down Jafar, who might still have the ability to help him return to Storybrooke. However, the Kraken also caused critical damage to the Nautilus, but Jasmine uses her second wish to send them to Jafar's pinpointed location, Hangman Island. After they part ways with Nemo and Liam, Hook, Aladdin, and Jasmine encounters Ariel, who had a vase-like lamp that contains Jafar, who is now a genie. When Jasmine summons Jafar, it only ends up freeing him, since he found a way to break his genie curse while imprisoned, before going on to knock out the others with magic. Jafar tells Jasmine that he no longer wants anything from her, only vengeance on those responsible for his imprisonment (Cyrus and Alice, from Once Upon a Time in Wonderland). Jafar goes on to mock each of them, calling Aladdin \\"battle-broken\\" and \\"weeping\\". At Jasmine's insistence, he tells her what happened to her kingdom, but only because the answer amused him - Agrabah was trapped inside the ring that she just wished up. Jafar then mocks Jasmine's past failure and inability to save her people, before demanding that Jasmine give him the ring. Jasmine, now emboldened, discovers a way to save her kingdom, as she turned Jafar into a walking staff using the magic powder, much to Jafar's shock. Then, she kisses Aladdin, thus freeing him from his genie curse, and causing the entire kingdom of Agrabah to re- materialize from the ring. Afterwards, Ariel helps Hook find a way to communicate with Emma, by giving him a seashell that can allow him to call her across realms. Hook uses the seashell, and he's able to reach Emma successfully, vowing that he'll had never meant to leave her, and that he'll find a way to return to her. =In Storybrooke= In the present day, Emma tells David about Hook having killed Robert. David is upset over this and about Hook's reluctance to confess himself, but Emma tells David that he left on the Nautilus after they broke up over this issue, as witnessed by Leroy earlier. Later, Regina suggests to Snow and Emma that they enjoy ladies' night at a new bar called \\"Aesop's Tables,\\" but a heartbroken Emma passes. At home, Emma accepts that Hook won't be coming back and gathers his things with Henry when she gets a phone call about a bar fight. As she arrives, Emma discovers that Regina and Snow tricked her into joining them. Regina encourages Emma to open up about her heartbreak while a drunk Snow challenges a group of Vikings to a knife-throwing contest. A crying Emma is met by the bar's owner, Aesop, who tells a heartbreaking of an artist and his wife, then gives her a napkin to wipe her tears away. When Emma returns home, she makes to put away Hook's belongings, when she noticed a seashell calling out her name, discovering that it was Hook telling her that he'll return to her. After Emma loses the signal, she hears Aesop's voice and she looks up, only to discover that Aesop was actually Gideon, who needed Emma's tears in order to blackmail her, telling her that with her tears, he will be able to prevent Hook from using any portals to return to Storybrooke, unless she helps him kill the Black Fairy.

Devised and performed by actor Aaron Davidman, it features seventeen characters of widely different backgrounds and ideological viewpoints. A fundamental emotional theme of the drama is the connected nature of sudden life experiences, with the performer describing the influence of events such as the construction of the West Bank barrier wall and American anti-Zionist demonstrations. Multiple comparisons take place beyond social divisions; an example of such a blurred moment being the move from performing a Jewish song in Hebrew to the saying of an Islamic prayer. The drama premiered in 2014 at the Intersection for the Arts complex in San Francisco, California. Background and performances Aaron Davidman is a Jewish-American actor who identifies as a socio-political \\"progressive\\", and he drew upon the occurrences during the many trips that he'd personally taken to Israel over the years. Wrestling Jerusalem takes inspiration from his attempt to emotionally comprehend the multiple perspectives that he's encountered, many of them filled with anxiety and sorrow about traumatic experiences. The Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict weighs heavily on the contents of the drama. The one-person show features Davidman performing as a wide variety of individuals that vary in not just nationality but also age, occupation, religion, and other such classes, displaying highly contrasting viewpoints. The uncomfortable nature of Israeli security efforts, compared directly to features found in concentration camps, is explored as well as the horror of witnessing protesters yelling \\"Death to the Jews\\" in American anti-Zionist demonstrations. Life experiences between characters become blurred in several instances, such as when Davidman switches from performing a Jewish song in Hebrew to the saying of an Islamic prayer. In one particular moment, the performer takes the role of an Israeli doctor commenting on the various sufferings that the character has witnessed. The doctor displays a disinterest in weighing what particular group of people has endured more, remarking that \\"I do not compare levels of trauma\\". Davidman declares, \\"It is irrelevant. Trauma is trauma.\\" The play had an 'Off Broadway' run in 2016. It was directed by Michael John Garc√©s, who had also overseen the drama's 2014 premier at the Intersection for the Arts complex in San Francisco, California. Its production team released a trailer for Wrestling Jerusalem on the video sharing website Vimeo.com that year as well, highlighting the play's lighting and use of music. Reviews Wrestling Jerusalem has received a mixed yet supportive review from Laura Collins-Hughes of The New York Times. She labelled the production a \\"smartly written solo show\\" that \\"trusts in the power of the human voice and the capacity of the human heart.\\" While stating that the characterization becomes \\"intensely frustrating\\", with the individuals profiled needing \\"far more room to breathe than they're allowed\\", she cited how the drama \\"believes that listening to one another's stories can change the way we move through the world.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle has published a laudatory review by Robert Hurwitt, who wrote: See also *Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict *Michael John Garc√©s *One person show References External links *WRESTLING JERUSALEM - Stage Trailer Jewish theatre Mass media about the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict Plays based on real people Plays for one performer Works about Israel ","title":"Wrestling Jerusalem"},{"id":"53672979","text":"Oristicta filicicola is a species of damselfly belonging to the family Isostictidae. Until 2017 it was the only species of the genus Oristicta. Commonly known as a slender wiretail, it is a slender and dull-coloured damselfly of medium-size. It is endemic to north-eastern Australia, where it inhabits streams in rainforests. Description =Body= Oristicta filicicola has olive-green eyes widely spaced on a small head. The synthorax is pale on the lower surface, graduating to a light green on the sides, with dark markings along the sutures. The upper surface is brown, outlined in black on the edges. The dorsal carina (mid-line ridge) is white on a dark background. The abdomen is long and slender, with a steel-like metallic-black on the upper surface, sharply cut off to cream ventral surfaces. At each segment join the paler colour sweeps up forming a narrow ring. On segments 9 and 10, the pale coloration sweeps up towards the rear, to form a dark wedge- shaped pattern on both segments. From a sample of twenty-six specimens held in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the average length from head to tail tip was 45 mm. The superior anal appendages of the male are club shaped and curve inwards. The inferior appendages are about half as long. In the female, the ovipositor is black and there are two small diverging filaments forming a ‚Äúv‚Äù shape. The appendages are short and pointed. =Wings= The wings are transparent with dark veins and the average wing span is 50mm. The pterostigma near the wing apex are dark grey outlined with black, measuring just more than half the length of the cell above which they are positioned. The forewings and hindwings are similar in layout. Postnodal crossveins number 12-14 in the forewing and 11-13 in the hindwing. Diagnostic features which distinguish Oristicta from other genera include the crossvein (Ac) being located between (Ax1) and (Ax2) but closer to (Ax1), and the median sector diverging after the nodal crossvein.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the division entered combat during the fall of that year, fighting in operations attempting to break the Siege of Leningrad. The division fought in the same area until the relief of Leningrad in February 1944, when it was transferred northwards to fight in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive, which ended the Continuation War. The division was transferred to Poland with the end of the Continuation War, and fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive and the Prague Offensive in early 1945. The division was disbanded soon after the end of the war in the summer of 1945.  History  The 286th began forming on 10 July 1941 at Cherepovets, part of the Arkhangelsk Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 994th, 996th, and 998th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 854th Artillery Regiment. In mid-August the division was transferred to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. While still forming in early September, the 286th was assigned to the 54th Army, also forming to the east of Leningrad. When the division was sent into combat with the 54th Army in October, its strength, less than half of the authorized division strength, was 6,016 personnel, 102 machine guns, 5 82mm or 120mm mortars, and 27 76mm or larger guns. The division fought as part of the 54th Army on the Leningrad Front until January 1942, when it was transferred to the Volkhov Front's 8th Army. The 286th served with the 8th Army until January 1944, fighting in operations attempting to end the Siege of Leningrad. The division transferred to the 59th Army for the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive in January 1944, which ended the Siege of Leningrad. During the offensive, the 854th Artillery Regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions were equipped with 12 76 mm guns each, while the 3rd Battalion received eight 76 mm guns and a battery of four 122 mm howitzers. After the disbandment of the Volkhov Front, the division transferred back to the 8th Army. On 21 April, the 286th became part of the 21st Army's 109th Rifle Corps, preparing for the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive, an attack which would result in Finnish withdrawal from the war. The division fought in the offensive from June to September, when Finland signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union. The division was moved south to become part of the 59th Army in September. The 286th spent the rest of the war with the 59th Army. In December the 59th was moved south to join the 1st Ukrainian Front, after which the division became part of the 115th Rifle Corps. The division fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in January 1945, during which the division was one of the four that liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp. The division then fought in the Upper Silesian Offensive in late March, and the Prague Offensive in early May. The division was disbanded in the summer of 1945 with the Central Group of Forces.

Mendis Wickramasinghe is a Sri Lankan herpetologist , taxonomist , naturalist ,wildlife photographer . Overcome by an unusual childhood passion on snakes, inspired by the magical diversity of his motherland, he has spent over two decades of his life experiencing the forests across Sri Lanka. L. J. Mendis Wickramasinghe  Biography  Wickramasinghe was born in Kalutara, 06 May 1976, and educated in Tissa Central College. He was employed as an Ecologist at the Sri Lanka Program of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for nearly seven years (2000-2007). Mendis formed the Herpetological Foundation of Sri Lanka (HFS) in year 2007, to further pursue in independent research on the herpetofauna of Sri Lanka, and also provide a platform for young herpetologists to initiate research.  Professional Experience  With over 25 years of field research experience on the herpetofauna of Sri Lanka, his work has focused on taxonomic identification and biodiversity assessment of reptiles and amphibians in an effort to increase awareness on the importance of conserving these unique organisms and their habitats in Sri Lanka, as part of our natural heritage. He has contributed his expertise towards national projects on identification of threatened species in Sri Lanka, in revising the Fauna and Flora Ordinance, and has facilitated the declaration of several protected areas in the country. He is the author of the book titled ‚ÄúRecognizing deadly venomous snakes from harmless snakes in Sri Lanka‚Äù.  Discoveries  He is credited with the discovery of over thirty new species (geckos, skinks, snakes and amphibians), also re-discovering several species of amphibians believed to have been extinct.  Photography Life  He began engaging in wildlife photography in a much later stage in his life while initially engaged in photography for scientific purposes, finally finding abode in the art of wildlife photography. Intrinsically motivated to capture the beauty lead by an overwhelming passion to express the most artistically composed image in what he sees, he seeks to share his experiences with those that admire the natural world and to protect the hidden spectacles of the wilderness for the future generations. ‚ÄúRepertoire: A pictorial gateway to Sri Lanka‚Äôs nature‚Äù marked his debut publication as a photographer. His wildlife images have been awarded both nationally and internationally. He currently contributes his knowledge as a wildlife photography lecturer and a national and international competition judge, while being the main course instructor in Wildlife photography at the Institute of Multimedia Education (IME).

After Lee entered the domain of China from Macao, he lost the ability to directly contact his family. There have been calls for his immediate release by human rights activists around the world. These include Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong, who joined Taiwan's New Power Party Executive Chairman Huang Kuo- chang, and former Sunflower Movement leaders to condemn Lee‚Äôs continued detention. Lee is a former worker for the Democratic Progressive Party and NGO employee, and the incident has led to friction between security institutions in Taiwan and China. A representative of the Chinese government has stated that Lee is under investigation on suspicion of harming national security. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), has said in a press conference that Lee is \\"currently in good physical condition\\". Lee‚Äôs wife, Lee Ching-yu, called on Beijing to immediately release him, and to clarify the charges brought against him and ensure his rights. Lee has previously used social media to promote the success of Taiwan's democracy to 'at least 100 people' in communist China. On this occasion, he had gone to China to arrange for his mother-in-law's medical treatment. In an effort to find her husband, Lee Ching-yu booked a flight from Taiwan to China on 10 April, however she has been banned from entering China by its Ministry of Public Security. On 13 April, an editorial in Taiwan News asserted that this is the type of situation that should be covered by the ‚ÄúCross-Strait Joint Crime-Fighting and Judicial Mutual Assistance Agreement‚Äù. On September 2017, Lee Ming-che pleaded guilty to \\"subverting state power\\" in a court in Hunan. His wife and supporters say his confession was forced. http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=96419&sid;=3 Since his conviction he has been incarcerated in Chishan Prison. In 2020 the Rescue Lee Ming-che Team held an exhibition in Taipei which featured 365 letters written to Lee Ming-che, the Team also organized a two week long lecture series on Lee‚Äôs case and the general human rights situation in China. The letter writing campaign was a response to Lee being denied the right to write/receive letters and telephone calls which violates both the Prison Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China and the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.

The concept has gained support in the NHS organisations of the United Kingdom as well as in Ireland and the Netherlands. The goals of social prescribing are to reduce the rise of healthcare costs and easing pressure of general practice clinics. A 2015 Commission in the UK estimated that about 20% of patient consultations were for social problems rather than medical problems.  Definition  Doctors can refer some of their patients to a social prescribing specialist or link worker who can then suggest local social groups which they can participate in to improve their health and wellbeing. These may include social enterprises, community businesses and local volunteer groups.  Evaluation  A 2016 review in The BMJ concluded that further, more robust testing was needed to determine how effective it was, noting that evidence in favour of social prescription came from small trials that were open to a range of biases. A study of social prescription programs at 23 GP surgeries in central London found it produced a strong improvement in qualitative outcomes such as making participants less isolated, while quantitative outcomes such as general health and wellbeing were largely unchanged.  Examples  In the London borough of Hackney, a social-prescribing scheme is in place. The local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCGs) tends to follow clinicians' lead, and so initiatives coming from doctors can make all the difference. Hackney CCG ran a tendering process for setting up social prescribing and got a service provider to implement it for them.  Resources  It is proposed to establish a National Academy for Social Prescribing in the UK. Healthy London Partnership has produced a report intended to help CCG commissioners make decisions about implementing social prescribing and are also hosting a wiki specifically on Social Prescribing and Self Care. There are plans to recruit more than a thousand linkworkers in England. The NHS Long Term Plan committed to recruiting at least 1000 trained social prescribing link workers in primary care networks by April 2021, with more in the following three years, so that at least 900,000 people will be referred to social prescribing by 2023/24.

It was first formed in the summer of 1941 and destroyed in the Bryansk pocket in the fall of 1941. The division was reformed in late December, including elements of the first formation, and served throughout the war before being disbanded in the summer of 1945.  History  = First Formation = The 287th began forming around 10 July 1941 at Yelets, part of the Orel Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 866th, 868th, and 870th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 851st Artillery Regiment. While still forming, the division was assigned its commander on 20 July and became part of the Bryansk Front reserves on 15 August. At the end of September, the division, possibly still trying to complete its formation, was trapped in the Bryansk pocket after the 2nd Panzer Group broke through the Soviet lines. On 3 October, the division was moved up from the reserve by rail and its eleven trains were unloaded at Brasovo station, 75 kilometers south of Bryansk. Between 3 and 5 October the division conducted unsuccessful counterattacks. The 287th was virtually destroyed by mid-October, but was not officially disbanded until 27 December. = Second Formation = The second formation of the 287th began forming in late December at Lipetsk with the same basic organization as the first formation, and quickly became part of the Bryansk Front while still forming. Its first units were formed from the remnants of the 287th's first formation that had escaped from the Bryansk pocket. The 287th joined the 3rd Army in January, and was assigned its commander in late February. The division fought in battles on the Bryansk Front and in May 1943 was transferred to the 63rd Army, still on the same front. In October, the army was transferred to the Belorussian Front, and on 20 December the 287th was transferred to the 13th Army. The division subsequently became part of the army's 24th Rifle Corps. By April 1944, its divisional anti-tank battalion was equipped with older model 76 mm M1936 or 76 mm M1939 (USV) guns. In July the division transferred to the army's 102nd Rifle Corps. The 287th transferred to the 38th Army's 67th Rifle Corps in November, and from December 1944 to the war's end was part of the 3rd Guards Army's 76th Rifle Corps. The division fought in the Berlin Offensive from late April 1945. On 25 April, its commander, Major General Iosif Pankratov, was killed by a large mine blast.

Rare species of birds and insects dependent on special ecosystem maintained by military activity started disappearing, until conservation grazing has been suggested as a method of maintaining the rare ecosystem. While overgrowth management using sheep grazing and scything is being used in some protected areas in the Czech Republic, sheep still graze differently from wild animals and their grazing is selective. ƒåesk√° krajina came up with a unique proposition - reintroducing three species of large herbivorous mammals. The project started by fencing in the area and creating an acclimatization pen, then on January 28, 2015, a group of 14 Exmoor ponies were moved from Exmoor National Park to Milovice in an effort to save the biodiversity of the location through conservation grazing. The first herd of six back-bred aurochs, bought from Dutch Taurus Foundation, arrived in October 2015. The first herd of European bison has been bought from European Bison Friends Society in Poland in November 2014. The group of seven female bisons from three Polish reserves (Pszczyna, Niepo≈Çomice and Kiermusy) arrived to Milovice in December 2015. A second herd of 14 Exmoor mares joined the bison enclosure in December 2015. In January 2018, nine young Exmoor stallions left Milovice on loan to two more protected areas, four are at Na Plachtƒõ (cz) in Hradec Kr√°lov√© and five at Josefov Meadows bird reserve. The stallions, born in Milovice in 2016, left their herds in accordance with natural behavior. Young stallions are at around two years of age chased away from their herd by its stallion, they form male groups where they grow stronger and better their skills, so that one day the strongest can fight a local stallion for his herd of mares. In February 2018, two Tauros heifers left the Milovice herd on loan to ≈Ωiv√° voda exposition in Modr√° (Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ District).  Rewilding  Large herbivorous mammals (bison, aurochs, Eurasian wild horse, elk) used to be an indispensable part of European wildlife. Unfortunately, aurochs and tarpan have been driven to extinction and bison only survived in captivity. Several restoration efforts of both wild horses and aurochs have been started in recent history, (e.g. konik, Heck cattle), but for the purpose of conservation grazing with very little human interference and management, scientists chose different breeds: Exmoor ponies and Tauros cattle. Milovice Nature Reserve is the first and only place in Europe where visitors can see all three species together again. = European bison = European bison (Bison bonasus) European bison, also called wisent, has been brought to Milovice from Poland on December 6, 2015. These seven particular Bison bonasus females belong to the rarer lowland (Bia≈Çowie≈ºa) line. The bison has good prospects of reintroduction into the wild in the Czech Republic. As the first step, the herd in Milovice is held in a large enclosure. In January 2016 four-year-old bull Polanin III arrived from O≈õrodek Kultury Le≈õnej in Go≈Çuchow (pl). The first calf was born in May 2016. The international bison studbook has assigned a \\"TU\\" prefix to the names of all bisons born in Milovice. *Numbers in total: 21 European bisons - 8 already born in Milovice (June 2018) = Aurochs = Tauros Program back-bred aurochs in Milovice Since the original aurochs (Bos primigenius) went extinct in 1627, ƒåesk√° krajina picked back bred cattle from the Dutch Tauros Programme. Tauros cattle are selectively bred from approx. 30 breeds of cattle with the aim to create a breed resembling aurochs in appearance, size, behaviour and manner of grazing. The first herd of Tauros arrived to the Czech Republic in October 2015, one male and five females. The first calf was born in April 2016. *Numbers in total: 13 Tauros - 7 born in Milovice (February 2018)https://hobby.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=hobby- mazlicci&c;=A180219_110117_hobby-mazlicci_mce&foto;=MCE717457_MKOP7855lr.jpg = Tarpan = Exmoor pony in Milovice Modern DNA analysis suggests that the closest surviving relative to the extinct Central and West European wild horse (Equus ferus ferus) is Exmoor pony. The very first herd of 14 Exmoor ponies (all mares) arrived to the Czech Republic in January 2015, in April the herd was joined by seven-year-old Exmoor stallion Northcroft Firestarter. The first wild horse foal born in the Czech Republic came on October 22, 2015, therefore her mother, Sgurr Na Ban A‚ÄôMhoire, must have come to Milovice already pregnant. The first Firestarter offspring arrived in March 2016. A second herd of Exmoors in the adjoining enclosure includes a second breeding stallion from UK, Tawbitts Mystic Merlin, born 2008. *Numbers in total: 55 Exmoor ponies - 25 already born in Milovice (February 2018)https://hobby.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=hobby- mazlicci&c;=A180219_110117_hobby-mazlicci_mce&foto;=MCE7175bc_MKOP5500lr.jpg  Biodiversity  European jackal has been scientifically observed in Milovice since 2015, the first photographic evidence of jackal breeding came in 2017. It is the northernmost documented location in Europe where jackal successfully breeds. First systematic monitoring of bats in Milovice discovered at least 18 different bat species, making it a two thirds of the total number of bat species native to the Czech Republic. Higher night-time bat activity was spotted above the large herbivore enclosures, showing the beneficial influence of conservation grazing on insect population. The bats also benefit from numerous ponds providing them with water and from the dense mosaic of deciduous forests, meadows and steppes. Among the counted species is the rare lesser horseshoe bat, lesser noctule and Bechstein's bat. A 2016 monitoring of butterflies found 59 species making it 42% of all butterfly species living in the Czech Republic. Eight protected and five endangered species were observed, for example phengaris rebeli, large copper, brown argus, plebejus argyrognomon, silver-washed fritillary, Amanda's blue, silver- studded blue, Meleager's blue, green forester and pearly heath. A European grey wolf was spotted by a trail cam inside the bison enclosure, so far it seems the animal had just been passing through.http://www.ceska- krajina.cz/2106/v-rezervaci-u-zubru-a-divokych-koni-se-objevil-vlk-zachytila- ho-fotopast/  See also  * Tourism in the Czech Republic * Protected areas of the Czech Republic * Rewilding (conservation biology) * Conservation grazing * Oostvaardersplassen, a similar large herbivores rewilding project in the Netherlands * Western Caucasus, the largest bison (wisent) habitat  External links  * Kudyznudy Czech Tourism * P≈ô√≠rodn√≠ rezervace Milovice * Truppen√ºbungsplatz Milowitz gallery of park photos by Michal K√∂pping References Nymburk District Nature reserves in the Czech Republic Protected areas in Central Bohemian Region IUCN Category IV Natura 2000 in the Czech Republic Protected areas of the Czech Republic Rewilding Charles University Masaryk University University of South Bohemia in ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice ","title":"Milovice Nature Reserve"},{"id":"53673239","text":"Oso Oso is an American rock band from Long Beach, New York.

Overview A proposition can be understood as truth-bearer, a textual expression of a potential fact (e.g., \\"Dante wrote the Divine Comedy\\"), represented in an amenable structure for computers [e.g., (\\"Dante\\", \\"wrote\\", \\"Divine Comedy\\")]. An OIE extraction normally consists of a relation and a set of arguments. For instance, (\\"Dante\\", \\"passed away in\\" \\"Ravenna\\") is a proposition formed by the relation \\"passed away in\\" and the arguments \\"Dante\\" and \\"Ravenna\\". The first argument is usually referred as the subject while the second is considered to be the object. The extraction is said to be a textual representation of a potential fact because its elements are not linked to a knowledge base. Furthermore, the factual nature of the proposition has not yet been established. In the above example, transforming the extraction into a full fledged fact would first require linking, if possible, the relation and the arguments to a knowledge base. Second, the truth of the extraction would need to be determined. In computer science transforming OIE extractions into ontological facts is known as relation extraction. In fact, OIE can be seen as the first step to a wide range of deeper text understanding tasks such as relation extraction, knowledge-base construction, question answering, semantic role labeling. The extracted propositions can also be directly used for end- user applications such as structured search (e.g., retrieve all propositions with \\"Dante\\" as subject). OIE was first introduced by TextRunner developed at the University of Washington Turing Center headed by Oren Etzioni. Other methods introduced later such as Reverb, OLLIE, ClausIE or CSD helped to shape the OIE task by characterizing some of its aspects. At a high level, all of these approaches make use of a set of patterns to generate the extractions. Depending on the particular approach, these patterns are either hand-crafted or learned. OIE systems and contributions Reverb suggested the necessity to produce meaningful relations to more accurately capture the information in the input text. For instance, given the sentence \\"Faust made a pact with the devil\\", it would be erroneous to just produce the extraction (\\"Faust\\", \\"made\\", \\"a pact\\") since it would not be adequately informative. A more precise extraction would be (\\"Faust\\", \\"made a pact with\\", \\"the devil\\"). Reverb also argued against the generation of overspecific relations. OLLIE stressed two important aspects for OIE. First, it pointed to the lack of factuality of the propositions. For instance, in a sentence like \\"If John studies hard, he will pass the exam\\", it would be inaccurate to consider (\\"John\\", \\"will pass\\", \\"the exam\\") as a fact. Additionally, the authors indicated that an OIE system should be able to extract non-verb mediated relations, which account for significant portion of the information expressed in natural language text. For instance, in the sentence \\"Obama, the former US president, was born in Hawaii\\", an OIE system should be able to recognize a proposition (\\"Obama\\", \\"is\\", \\"former US president\\"). ClausIE introduced the connection between grammatical clauses, propositions, and OIE extractions. The authors stated that as each grammatical clause expresses a proposition, each verb mediated proposition can be identified by solely recognizing the set of clauses expressed in each sentence. This implies that to correctly recognize the set of propositions in an input sentence, it is necessary to understand its grammatical structure. The authors studied the case in the English language that only admits seven clause types, meaning that the identification of each proposition only requires defining seven grammatical patterns. The finding also established a separation between the recognition of the propositions and its materialization. In a first step, the proposition can be identified without any consideration of its final form, in a domain-independent and unsupervised way, mostly based on linguistic principles. In a second step, the information can be represented according to the requirements of the underlying application, without conditioning the identification phase. Consider the sentence \\"Albert Einstein was born in Ulm and died in Princeton\\". The first step will recognize the two propositions (\\"Albert Einstein\\", \\"was born\\", \\"in Ulm\\") and (\\"Albert Einstein\\", \\"died\\", \\"in Princeton\\"). Once the information has been correctly identified, the propositions can take the particular form required by the underlying application [e.g., (\\"Albert Einstein\\", \\"was born in\\", \\"Ulm\\") and (\\"Albert Einstein\\", \\"died in\\", \\"Princeton\\")]. CSD introduced the idea of minimality in OIE. It considers that computers can make better use of the extractions if they are expressed in a compact way. This is especially important in sentences with subordinate clauses. In these cases, CSD suggests the generation of nested extractions. For example, consider the sentence \\"The Embassy said that 6,700 Americans were in Pakistan\\". CSD generates two extractions [i] (\\"6,700 Americans\\", \\"were\\", \\"in Pakistan\\") and [ii] (\\"The Embassy\\", \\"said\\", \\"that [i]). This is usually known as reification.

Her work in community psychology led to the discipline being recognized in 1985 as a compulsory subject in Italian universities where psychology is taught as a major subject. Francescato is currently the Scientific Director of the post-graduate School of Specialization in clinical community psychology and psychotherapy at ASPIC (Associazione per lo Sviluppo Psicologico dell'Individuo e della Comunit√†, Association for the Psychological Development of the Individual and the Community). Previously, she was a Full Professor of Community Psychology at the University of Rome, a position she retired from in 2014 at the age of 70.  Background  Francescato earned her B.A. in French literature from Rice University in 1967. She later went on to receive an M.A. in French literature from Rice University in 1970, and a PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Houston in 1972. Her post-doctoral fellowship was undertaken at Brandeis University as a research associate in the Sociology department. Upon her return to Italy, she wrote the first Italian textbook on community psychology and co-founded Effe, a feminist magazine active from 1972 to 1982. She also co-founded the European Network of Community Psychologists (ENCP) which gave birth to the European Association Community Association (ECPA). She is a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, the Global Journal of Community Psychology Practice, Psicologia di Comunit√† (Community Psychology) and Psicoterapia Familiare (Family Psychotherapy). During her academic career Francescato developed the concept and practice of innovative online teaching methodologies to teach professional competences using computer-supported collaborative learning. She also developed intervention methodologies to promote individual, group, organizational and community empowerment, as well as many intervention programs for the empowerment of women, immigrants and members of disadvantaged communities. One prong of her research involves evaluating these methodologies.  Contributions  Francescato's contributions fall in three main areas. In women's studies, she investigates sex roles in families and communes; gender differences among activists, local and national politicians; dual career families; single childrearing; and separation and divorce processes. She is currently studying gender differences in aging processes, studying triads of caregiver/elder/most involved relative, as well as triads of grandparent/parent/adult grandchild, for effects on systemic wellbeing and intergenerational solidarity. In the field of theory- grounded intervention methodologies, she investigates: personal empowerment using traditional media and online social networks; organizational empowerment through participatory multidimensional organizational analysis; and community empowerment through multidimensional profiling. Lastly, in the field of teaching professional competences, she evaluates the comparative efficacy of face to face and online methodologies.

It started because of a disagreement over an agreed sum of 6,000 silver marks for Danish assistance to Magnus Birgersson in the battle against Valdemar Birgersson in 1275. Background Eric V of Denmark had signed an agreement on military assistance with Duke Magnus Birgersson who hired hundreds of armored warriors from the danish king's own army in addition to a strength of 700 men which was led by Count Jacob of Halland and the Danish Stig Andersen Hvide. Together they started a rebellion against Valdemar, King of Sweden which was known as the war against Valdemar Birgersson. It resulted in Magnus becoming King of Sweden. The war Duke Magnus Birgersson proclaiming himself king of Sweden, refused to pay the agreed sum of 6,000 marks of silver and complained about the ravages the Danish Assistance Force allegedly committed. Instead, he started a war by moving into the then Danish provinces of Halland and Sk√•ne by total surprise in the fall of 1276. The Danes mobilized an army near Uffo marches and stopped the Swedish army, which then fled Scania. The next year Danish forces marched on Sm√•land in retaliation for their depredations in Halland and Sk√•ne. The Danish punitive expedition followed the scarce Swedish Defense Forces into V√§sterg√∂tland, where they met a Swedish part of the army of about 200 knights in armor, led by Ulf Karlsson. The Battle of Ettak was a defeat for the Danish army who were surprised in their own camp. Erik Klipping gathered a large army in 1277 and went into V√§sterg√∂tland which again was overcome and looted. The fortresses of Axwall and Skara was captured by the Danish army. Eric V of Denmark decided to end the campaign because it was not meant as anything other than an act of revenge in response to the Swedish king's assault on Halland and Sk√•ne. After returning home, Eric V of Denmark began negotiations with the Swedes leading to a peace agreement in Laholm, Scania in early 1278. Magnus Birgersson had to pay war reparations which were reduced from 6,000 to 4,000 marks of silver. Aftermath The war resulted in Magnus Birgersson remaining king of Sweden but he had to pay 4,000 marks of silver to the Danes.

Biography  Yevhen Halych was born in Bila Tserkva, Kyiv Oblast on 29 April 1984, but the first eight years of his life he spent in Kazakhstan, where his father served in the Soviet Army. In 1992 his family, including his brother Andriy, moved to Poltava, where he has lived long since. Yevhen started attending musical classes when he was five years old. In 1994 he met Denys Miziuk, who was his neighbour and who would later become the guitarist of O.Torvald and the best friend of Yevhen Halych. From 1999 to 2005 they played together in the band \\"Kruty! Pedali\\", then they started the band O.Torvald. Halych studied in Poltava Institute of Military Telecommunications (now he is a lieutenant of reserve, engineer of telecommunication systems and networks). During his last years in the institute, he worked on the radio station. While working there he felt that the music was the only thing he wanted to do in his life. Soon after graduating from the institute in 2006, he and his band moved to Kyiv, where they rented a house. From 2006 to 2010 they lived in that house all together, and it also acted as their studio. At the beginning they did not receive much money from producing music, so everyone worked for other jobs, leaving not much time for music. In 2008 they recorded their first album \\"O.Torvald\\" and the popularity of their band started to increase, especially since 2011. In the past Halych was the only composer and lyrics writer, but now Mykola \\"DJ Polyarnyk\\" Rayda, who is a friend and former groupmate of Yevhen, is helping him. Apart from O.Torvald, Yevhen Halych also participates in the band \\"NUDLY\\" with rapper Andriy Shostakov. While living in Kyiv, Yevhen worked for a number of television channels, including the music TV-channel M1 (at the invitation of Oleksandr Asaulyuk), entertainment TV- channel NLO TV and, from 2018, a channel playing alternative music called Megogo Live. https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2018/11/06/megogo-launches-new- music-channel-for-ukraine/ In addition to his television work, Yevhen also worked for the radio station \\"Prosto Radi.O\\". He stated about his work on the radio: Yevhen Halych has a wife, Valeriya, who gave birth to a daughter in 2013. Yevhen dedicated a song \\"–ù–∞—Å –¥–≤–æ—î\\" (\\"Two of us\\") to his wife. She also took part in several videos of O.Torvald.  Participation in Eurovision  On 25 February 2017, O.Torvald won national selection for Eurovision, so Yevhen Halych represented Ukraine with the song \\"Time\\" on Eurovision Song Contest 2017 as a member of O.Torvald.

The curriculum is entirely unarmed; there are no weapons used in this system. The school is of Chinese origin, based on techniques brought to Japan by Buddhist refugees. It was one of the styles studied by Edward William Barton- Wright, the founder of Bartitsu, and one of the first Westerners to practice Japanese martial arts.

In 1763 physician and naturalist Giovanni Targioni Tozzetti had already catalogued the natural specimens housed in the Galleria Imperiale in Florence. In 1766 the Grand Duke instructed Trentine physiologist Felice Fontana to gather the collections of scientific instruments housed in the Pitti Palace. In 1771 he also collected a large part of the Medici instruments that were kept in the Stanzino delle Matematiche (Mathematics Room) of the Uffizi Gallery. Restoration works of the Torrigiani Palace, that had to become home to the Reale Museo di Fisica e Storia Naturale, began in 1772. On the iniziative of the Grand Duke, Fontana was surrounded with a small group of young scholars which included Giovanni Fabbroni, with whom Fontana established a close relationship. The museum was officially opened in 1775 under the direction of Fontana, who was supported by Fabbroni as deputy director.  The Collections  Ticket for the visit of the Royal Museum of Physics and Natural History of Florence Since its foundation, the Reale Museo housed scientific instruments, natural specimens and a large collection of anatomical wax models that came from previous collections or were specially made to be displayed in the new museum. The very first nucleus of the scientific instruments housed in the museum came from the physics laboratory in the Pitti Palace. Then came 202 objects from the Medici collections in the Uffizi Gallery, that comprised measuring, mathematical and astronomical instruments‚Äîincluding Galileo's geometrical and military compass and the lens he used to observe the sky, Egnazio Danti's instrument of the Primum Mobile, Giovan Battista Giusti's quadrants, Della Volpaia's sundials and nocturnals, and Antonio Santucci's armillary sphere. Finally, the instruments of the Accademia del Cimento were moved from the Pitti Palace to the Reale Museo as well. As far as natural history specimens, the museum housed the collections rearranged by Targioni Tozzetti, including Pier Antonio Micheli's herbaria and the collections of Dutch naturalist Georg Everhard Rumph and Danish physician and geologist Niels Steensen. The engagement of wax modeller Clemente Susini made it possible to create a great lot of anatomical wax models portraying human body's musculature, internal organs, bones, the eye, the ear, and the nose. Six rooms were needed to display the many wax models. The collection first core was enlarged in the following years with new exhibits that were made‚Äîfirst for studying reasons, then especially for educational reasons‚Äîby the workshops that were housed in the Torrigiani Palace since the Reale Museum's beginnings.  The Botanical Garden and the Specola  Map of the Royal Museum Botanical Garden The Torrigiani Palace bordered Boboli Gardens‚Äîand this was a good chance to create a botanical garden, whose direction was entrusted to Attilio Zuccagni. The garden sheltered several species of plants classified according to Linnaean taxonomy, that assigned an appropriate name and class to each plant, pointing out its possible medical use as well. While the renovation works of the palace were underway, Fontana had already a mind to turn the Torrino (small tower) into an astronomical and meteorological observatory. When in 1775 he met Johann III Bernoulli, astronomer to the King of Prussia and director of the Berlin observatory, Fontana asked him some suggestions, but the grand-ducal court agreed only partly with Bernoulli's ideas. The shortage of skilled craftsmen made Fontana decide to buy the needed instruments in London. The great expenses caused a big time lag in the completion of works, that continued until 1796, when Fabbroni assigned the astronomer Domenico de Vecchi the responsibility of reorganizing the observatory and beginning to collect astronomical data. Fontana thought that the museum had to be arranged according to the order of nature, appropriately classified. The ground floor housed, in addition to the storerooms, minerals from Tuscany and the chemistry laboratory; the physics laboratory, the library and the zoology collections were located at the first floor; wax models, stuffed animals, fossils, and precious stones were on display at the second floor. Visitors and scholars were thus able to travel from microcosm‚Äîchemistry‚Äîthrough the elements of nature, to macrocosm‚Äîastronomy‚Äîin the observatory.  The Liceo  Fontana would have liked to found a \\"society of scientists\\"‚Äîa new Accademia del Cimento‚Äîaimed at researching and disseminating new discoveries, but the grand-ducal court didn't support his plan because it was too expensive. Fabbroni, who took Fontana's place as museum director in 1805, complemented research with educational activity. But it was only his successor, Girolamo Bardi, who was able to open a liceo [high school] in the Torrigiani Place in 1807. The first chairs to be established were Botanics and Anatomy‚Äîhold by Ottaviano Targioni Tozzetti and the surgeon Filippo Uccelli respectively‚Äîbut four more were soon created. The subjects taught in the liceo were six, namely Chemistry, Experimental and theoretical physics, Astronomy, Natural history, and Comparative anatomy. The liceo was actually a short-life adventure, because Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Lorraine‚Äîwho came back into power after Napoleon I's fall‚Äîwanted the museum to interrupt educational activities and go back to conservation and research. Vincenzo Antinori, who became the museum director in 1829, started again the pedagogical project and established the chairs of Physics, Comparative anatomy and zoology, and mineralogy and geology, which were granted to Leopoldo Nobili, Gaspero Mazzi and Filippo Nesti respectively. Educational and museological duties were closely connected as the full professors were the curators of the collections as well. New chairs were created in the following years, so making the liceo a more and more important institute for both specialized studies and research.  The Italian Central Meteorological Archives  In 1839, on the occasion of the First Conference of Italian Scientists in Pisa, the attendees celebrated the development of meteorological studies and stressed the need for turning meteorology into a science. The museum welcomed this hope and in 1844 released a memorandum asking Italian observatories to help in the creation of a Central Meteorological Archives. The goal was collecting, arranging and publishing all data from meteorological observations in Italy. Cooperation and the exchange of information was regarded as the condition necessary to the advancement of meteorology in Italy and worldwide. Accordingly, the Archives established a close network of relationships with observatories as well as European and US. scientists.  The Move of Collections  In 1859 the museum was turned into the section of Physical and Natural Sciences of the Istituto di Studi Superiori Pratici e di Perfezionamento (Institute for Advanced and Specialized Studies), that was founded in Florence by the Provisional Government of Tuscany. From then on, educational activities, research and conservation of the collections became more and more separated. In 1872 astronomical observations were moved to the new Observatory at Arcetri. The instruments and machines used for teaching were placed in the various sections of the Istituto, which were destined to become the departments of the University of Florence. Zoology collections remained in the Torrigiani Palace, which is today home to La Specola Museum. Botanical specimens were gathered in the Giardino dei Semplici (the botanical garden). The exhibit of historical instruments in the Tribune of Galileo and the adjacent rooms remained unchanged and in 1874 was named Museo degli Strumenti Antichi di Astronomia e di Fisica (Museum of Ancient Astronomical and Physics Instruments). In 1875, Ferdinando Meucci began to catalogue those instruments that in 1929, after some ups and downs, became the patrimony of the Istituto e Museo di Storia della Scienza‚Äîtoday's Museo Galileo.  The Archives of the Reale Museo  Archival records produced by the Reale Museo between 1780 and 1872, which were first stored in the Department of Physics at the University of Florence, are today housed in the Museo Galileo's Library. This collection is the most important source to reconstruct the history of the Reale Museo and its relationships with the main scientific institutions in Europe as well as to know the many instruments of the museum collections and the related events.

Under Anker J√∏rgensen's leadership, she was Minister without Portfolio (1977‚Äì80) and Minister of Culture (February 1980 to September 1982). As a psychologist, she was head of psychology in Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet (1958) as well as the first woman to become professor of clinical psychology at Copenhagen University (1963), a position she resumed after her political career ended in the mid-1980s. Biography Born on 18 November 1924 in Odense, √òstergarrd was the daughter of Alfred √òstergaard (1890‚Äì1962) and his wife Martha Kirstine Nielsen (1885‚Äì1944). She spent her first 12 years in Odense before moving with her parents to Gentofte. Although she encountered difficulties at school, she finally embarked on psychology studies at Copenhagen University. On leaving home against her father's wishes, she paid her own way by working as a doctor's secretary. =Psychology= After graduating in 1947, √òstergaard worked as a psychologist in Norrtulls sjukhus, a children's hospital in Stockholm. In 1949, she returned to Denmark, first spending a year in Dronning Louises B√∏rnehospital (Queen Louise's Children's Hospital) before moving to the newly established children's psychology clinic at Copenhagen University where she remained until 1954. She then entered the Rigshospitalet's psychology department where she was appointed head psychologist in 1958, expanding her experience in clinical psychology. As a result, from 1955 to 1960 she headed a course in clinical psychology for the Dansk Psychologforening (Danish Psychologists Association) while teaching as the first woman psychologist at the university. She also took up assignments as a guest lecturer in Lund, Sweden, and Bergen, Norway. Published in 1961, her Den psykologiske testmetode og dens relation til klinisk psykiatri (The Psychological Test Method and its Relationship to Clinical Psychiatry) raised considerable interest among psychiatrists. While working at Rigshospitalet, √òstergaard treated a number of schizophrenic patients. In 1962, this led to her En psykologisk analyse af de formelle schizofrene tankeforstyrrelser (A Psychological Analysis of Formal Schizophrenic Thought Disorders), paving the way for research on the borderline between psychology and psychiatry in collaboration with the National Institute of Mental Health in the United States. In 1963, √òstergaard became the first female professor of psychology at Copenhagen University. After heading the Studenterr√•dgivningsklinikken (Student Advisory Clinic, 1964‚Äì68), she established the Institut for Klinisk Psykologi (Clinical Psychology Institute) in 1968. From 1970 to 1973, she was a member of Denmark's Unesco committee and from 1973 a member of Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber (The Danish Academy of Technical Sciences). =Political career= In the early 1970s, √òstergaard became involved in the Danish Refugee Council, acting as spokesman from 1974 to 1977. She also increasingly became active in children's affairs, becoming spokesman for the Danish Children's Commission where she promoted the need for paternity leave. Her life underwent a significant change in 1977 when Anker J√∏rgensen offered her an appointment as Minister without Portfolio with special responsibilities for foreign affairs. Although she had no political background, √òstergaard was not afraid to criticize the West for fighting for its status as a ruling class rather than helping the poor. She drew considerable attention in 1980 when she opposed Denmark's support for NATO's decision to modernize Western Europe's rocket defences. After gaining increasing popularity, she was elected to the Folketing with a considerable majority in 1979 as representative for Gladsaxe. In 1980, she was appointed Minister of Culture and Minister for Nordic Affairs until the socialist government was defeated in 1982. In 1980, she chaired the UN World Conference on Women in Copenhagen and in 1982 she was deputy chair of the Unesco World Cultural Conference in Mexico. She remained a member of parliament until 1984 but did not seek re-election. =Later life= On leaving the Folketing, √òstergaard returned to Copenhagen University, concentrating on the need for women to contribute to international development. She held her post as professor until 1994. Lise √òstergaard died on 19 March 1996 in Copenhagen and is buried in Holmens Cemetery. She shares a grave with Gunnar P. Rosendahl (1919‚Äì1996) whom she married in 1974.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the division was sent into combat on the Volkhov Front in the fall of that year. The division served in the area until early 1944 when the Siege of Leningrad was ended and the 288th advanced into the Baltic states. The division spent the final months of the war blockading trapped German troops in the Courland Pocket before being disbanded in early 1946.  History  The 288th began forming on 13 July 1941 at Yaroslavl, part of the Moscow Military District, from reservists. Its basic order of battle included the 1012th, 1014th, and 1016th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 834th Artillery Regiment. The division was moved north within a month and in mid-August was assigned to the new 52nd Army, forming east of Leningrad in the swampy Volkhov area. The overstretched division held a front of 46 kilometers in the Volkhov area by mid-October. In early January 1942, the division was transferred to the 4th Army, still in the Volkhov Front. In November 1943 it was transferred to the 54th Army's 111th Rifle Corps. After the end of the Siege of Leningrad in January 1944, the division advanced into the Baltic states in the spring and summer. In August the 288th was transferred to the 1st Shock Army in Latvia and in late October became part of the 42nd Army's 123rd Rifle Corps. From January 1945, the division was part of the 22nd Army's 14th Guards Rifle Corps, blockading German troops trapped in the Courland Pocket on the Baltic coast of Lithuania. In March the 14th Guards Rifle Corps was transferred to the Courland Group of Forces of the 2nd Baltic Front, with which it ended the war in May with the surrender of the German Army Group Courland. The division was disbanded by February 1946 with the 14th Guards Rifle Corps in the Kiev Military District, where it had relocated in August 1945.

California, Berkeley, Calif., 1970/1971), Vol. II: Probability theory, pp. 241‚Äì265. Univ. California Press, Berkeley, Calif., 1972. The inequality remained unproven until 2014, when Thomas Royen, a German statistician, proved it using relatively elementary tools. The proof was not generally known when it was published in 2014, due to Royen's relative anonymity and that the proof was published in a predatory journal. Another reason was multiple futile attempts to prove it, causing skepticism among mathematicians in the field. The conjecture, and its solution, came to public attention in 2017, when reports of Royen's proof were published in mainstream media. The problem The Gaussian correlation inequality states: Let \\\\mu be an n-dimensional Gaussian probability measure on \\\\mathbb{R}^n , i.e. \\\\mu a multivariate normal distribution, centered at the origin. Then for all convex sets E,F \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n that are symmetric about the origin, : \\\\mu(E \\\\cap F) \\\\geq \\\\mu(E) \\\\cdot \\\\mu(F). As a simple example, one can think of darts in the plane distributed according to a multivariate normal distribution. If we are considering a circle and a rectangle, both centered at the origin, then the proportion of the darts landing in the intersection of both shapes is no less than the product of the proportions of the darts landing in each shape. Royen's proof of the conjecture generalizes it, as well as demonstrating the same statement for the gamma distribution.

DMR theory was first developed by anthropologist Harvey Whitehouse following his ethnographic fieldwork in Papua New Guinea. The theory proposes that religions tend to coalesce around two divergent modes, termed imagistic and doctrinal, which are distinguished primarily by their ritual practices. The imagistic mode is characterized by infrequently performed, high arousal rituals (e.g. initiation rites) and is associated with small scale, exclusive religious groups. In contrast the doctrinal mode is characterized by frequently performed, low arousal rituals (e.g. daily recitations of sacred texts) and is associated with larger inclusive communities, as found in the major world religions. The theory posits that these differing ritual patterns promote the transmission of religious traditions by exploiting core memory processes. Imagistic rituals arouse strong emotion and generate vivid, flashbulb like, episodic memories, while doctrinal rituals repetitive nature means that rather than individual events the experiences over time are stored in procedural and semantic memories. Later formulations of the theory also emphasised the different forms of group cohesion that are generated by the two modes, with imagistic rituals promoting intense, relational bonds with the other ritual participants and doctrinal rituals promoting more diffuse, categorical bonds with larger communities who share the same identity markers. DMR theory was tested empirically against data on 645 rituals from the HRAF global ethnographic database and the anticipated clustering of rituals around imagistic and doctrinal modes was confirmed. Ethnographic and historical examinations of the theory have been broadly positive and archaeologists have drawn upon DMR to explain the transition from small-scale societies to larger, more complex civilizations. Similarly, historians and biologists have utilized DMR theory to help explain why some religions separate into sects and how reformations may occur. However, the theory has been challenged by some scholars on theoretical grounds and faced criticisms from some ethnographers and historians for suggesting too strong of a division between imagistic and doctrinal modes. Although the DMR theory developed out of research on religious groups, more recent research has found evidence that the ritual dynamics described apply outside of the religious domain, including amongst football fans and armed militias, and that it may therefore serve as a more general theory of ritual and social cohesion.  Imagistic mode  The imagistic mode of religiosity involves collective rituals that are infrequent and highly emotional. Examples of these types of rituals include various initiation rites and rites of passage. The often dysphoric and highly emotional nature of these types of rituals activate the episodic memory system, resulting in detailed autobiographical memories. These dysphoric rituals can produce an extreme form of cohesion with the group, known as identity fusion. DMR posits that fusion with other group members will also motivate the individual to act out extreme forms of altruism, especially when the group is threatened. Therefore, the imagistic mode of religiosity prevails when a group‚Äôs survival depends on extremely high levels of cohesion.  Doctrinal mode  The doctrinal mode of religiosity refers to collective rituals that are frequent, usually routinized, and generate relatively little affect. Examples of this type of collective ritual would include Holy Communion and Call to prayer. Due to the repetitive nature of these types of rituals, semantic memory systems are thought to be activated and function similarly to organizing other general schemas and scripts of general knowledge. In contrast to the imagistic mode, these routinized rituals tend to produce less intense group identification, which serves to promote trust and cooperation but not extreme self-sacrifice. DMR posits that the historical transition from small-scale societies to the invention of agriculture brought about the need for large-scale cooperation and collective identity.

She is not to be confused with the author of the same name born in 1931.  Childhood and education  Sheepshanks' father was John Sheepshanks, an Anglican bishop, her mother was Margaret Ryott. The couple had thirteen children who survived infancy, of which Mary was the eldest daughter. Her mother did not have much time for her because of her many children, and Mary's relationship with her father was bad as well. She attended the Liverpool High School for Girls and lived in Kassel to learn German when she was seventeen. In 1891, she enrolled at Newnham College, Cambridge to study medieval and modern languages.  Career  = Social work = During her university years, Sheepshanks started teaching literacy classes to adults in Barnwell, Cambridgeshire. She met Bertrand Russell during this time, whose progressive ideas influenced Mary to the extent that her father didn't want her to come home during holidays. Mary had also, at some point, become an atheist. In 1895, Sheepshanks joined the Women's University Settlement in Southwark, where young adults with a university degree would help impoverished people. In 1897, she became vice- president of Morley College for Working Men and Women, where she asked, among others, Virginia Woolf to give lectures. = Women's suffrage = Sheepshanks had also invited Christabel Pankhurst to give a lecture at Morley College. This happened in 1907, where she spoke at a debate on women's suffrage. Sheepshanks' closing remarks to the debate were that women should be granted the vote because it would be good for them and for the state. She was a more moderate suffragist as opposed to a suffragette because she did not agree with their violent actions, but she did appreciate the suffragettes' courage. Sheepshanks joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies and, in 1913, went on a European tour to talk about suffrage and other subjects that concerned women. That same year, she visited the International Congress of Women in Budapest. Here, she was appointed secretar of the International Alliance of Women and editor of its magazine, Jus Suffragii.Career with Jus Suffragii Magazine She was encouraged to take on these functions by Jane Addams. = Pacifism and Jus Suffragii = Mary Sheepshanks was a pacifist and opposed World War I. She advocated her point of view in Jus Suffragii and called for disarmament. In November 1914, she wrote: \\"Armaments must be drastically reduced and abolished, and their place taken by an international police force. Instead of two great Alliances pitted against each other, we must have a true Concert of Europe. Peace must be on generous, unvindictive lines, satisfying legitimate national needs, and leaving no cause for resentment such as to lead to another war. Only so can it be permanent.\\"Mary Sheepshanks in Jus Suffragii,01-11-1914, p.184 She wanted the magazine to remain neutral in its rapports of voting rights, so she asked women in non- belligerent states to send her news about women in the Central Powers. She also advocated for Britain to take in Belgian refugees and the International Women's Relief Committee was housed in the Jus offices. Many suffragists did not agree with Sheepshanks' neutral approach and she received many verbal attacks from both them and the press for giving attention to 'enemy states'. This lead her to open a file for 'anonymous abuse'.Sybil Oldfield, Mary Sheepshanks Edits an Internationalist Suffrage Monthly in wartime: Jus Suffragii 1914‚Äì1919 There were also people who defended Sheepshanks' neutrality, and after the war she received various letters thanking her for keeping the women's movement united. = After the war = In 1918, Sheepshanks was appointed secretary of the Fight the Famine Council, an organisation that occupied itself with the need for a new economical order in Europe. In 1920, she lobbied the League of Nations to admit Germany and revise the reparations demanded by the Treaty of Versailles. She became international secretary of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and resigned her position in 1931 because she disagreed with the position of other members of the board. She kept on organising conferences, campaigning for peace and helping victims of war. Between 1939 and 1940, she welcomed her olf friend, the Czech Jewish social worker Marie Schmolka, who stayed with her in Gospel Oak. The Second World War had made Mary pessimistic, writing to her niece: \\"[...] I admit that this war has made me deeply pessimistic, the incredible savagery and beastliness of the Germans and the immeasurable suffering they caused make me despair of human nature [...]\\" She was opposed to blanket bombings and feared the consequences of nuclear weapons. During her later years, Mary Sheepshanks suffered from various health issues, like arthritis. In 1955, she wrote her memoirs. Because of her increasingly bad health and her help resigning, she decided to commit suicide rather than being placed in a care home. She died in her house in Hampstead on 21 January 1960, aged 87.

Life He was the youngest son of Samuel Rainbow Girdlestone, a chancery barrister, born in London 6 September 1805, and younger brother of Charles Girdlestone. He matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, 10 June 1822, and in 1823 was admitted a scholar of his college, became B.A. in 1826, M.A. in 1829, and was ordained to the curacy of Deane, Lancashire, in 1828. Having taken priest's orders he became vicar of Deane in 1830. Lord-chancellor Cranworth conferred on Girdlestone in 1854 the place of canon residentiary of Bristol Cathedral, and he consequently succeeded to the vicarage of St. Nicholas with St. Leonard, Bristol, in 1855. He resigned it in 1858 for the vicarage of Wapley with Codrington, Gloucestershire. In 1862 he became vicar of Halberton, Devon, and ultimately in March 1872 vicar of Olveston, near Almondsbury, Bristol. At Halberton, Girdlestone saw rural deprivation. In 1867 he became active on behalf of agricultural labourers, and at a meeting of the British Association at Norwich in 1868 he proposed an agricultural labourers' trade union. He spoke and organised on behalf of this project. He helped 600 agricultural families move from the west of England, where work was scarce and poorly paid, to the north.

Rafaeli received her doctorate from Ohio State University in 1985 in Organisational Psychology. She went on to do a post-doctorate at the faculty of industrial engineering and management at Stanford University. Academic career Rafaeli returned to Israel to teach at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem at the business administration school. Rafaeli's research spans different aspects of organisational theory. Early in her career she conducted and published studies that invalidated the notion of the utility of graphology in personnel selection processes. She also conducted and published studies of hers which tested and disproved the economic viability of employment advertising. Her works did show that the technique of employment advertising does have other benefits. On top of these Rafaeli worked in the field of quality circles and their positive impact on employees' emotions. Rafaeli's major field of study is defining emotions in the context of emotional labor as a factor in organisational processes. Working together with Robert I. Sutton, Rafaeli identified mechanisms of recruitment, instruction and rewards to employees which exert emotions that are required as part of their jobs. She has researched the importance of the dress code in the workplace in general and in the service industry in particular. This research was conducted as part of a larger work on symbols and artifacts in the workplace. Rafaeli's research papers have also touched on the world of customer service. She studied the psychology of queues and queue management and the impact of anger of customers towards employees. Rafaeli researched customer service through technology media channels, such as online chat in collaborations with IBM and LivePerson. for which she received an IBM research award.

Early artwork on the webcomic was provided by Octavi Navarro. √Ägueda has presented his webcomic in multiple comic exhibitions since its inception, and he has become a recurring face in the Spanish webcomic scene. Xavier √Ägueda Xavier √Ägueda in 2011 Xavier √Ägueda was born in 1979 in Barcelona. √Ägueda is an engineer and high school teacher, creating cartoons in his spare time. Besides creating El Listo, √Ägueda has written a short story in L'estiu d'Ulises i altres contes as well as the prologues of Comics 2.0: Antolog√≠a del Webc√≥mic, Zombess, Cr√≥nicas PSN 3, and Spooky Volumen 2. Moreover, √Ägueda is involved with various webcomic blogs, collaborates with the Comic Book Guide, and writes textbooks for Editorial Casals. √Ägueda often uses his illustrations in the classes he teaches in technology and natural science. √Ägueda described his experiences as a webcomic author in his 2015 autobiography Una Amante Complacient. Character The character El Listo is a 30-year old, unemployed engineer, who is drawn with a monkey-like appearance. The character reads books, watches films, and studies up on various topics, to the point where he is able to give his opinion on a large variation of subjects. √Ägueda admits that the character resembles him to some degree, but has consistently denied that El Listo is based on himself or that his strips are autobiographical. In an interview, √Ägueda explained that \\"[El Listo] studied the same things as I did, he is about my age and has my hobbies, but he is a caricature. He has things from me, from my friends, and from people I know.\\" El Listo spends his time with the supporting characters El Gordo, El Cachas, Tito, and Borja, which are all caricatures of early 21st century youth archetypes. Development √Ägueda thought up the character of El Listo in 2003, and quickly drew up four pages with him. However, when he gained no responses from the magazines he contacted about it, √Ägueda decided to benefit from the still fairly untapped potential of the World Wide Web and put his work online. When √Ägueda first uploaded his cartoons, he didn't know what webcomics were and social media services had yet to come into prominence. Inspired by the WordPress template ComicPress, which was designed to be used by cartoonists, √Ägueda used Dreamweaver to build a website for himself. El Listo is sometimes published on the 20 minutos website. √Ägueda has exhibited his cartoons at Especula en Acci√≥n (Antequera, 2006), Humor Gr√°fico por la Libertad de Prensa (Madrid, 2008), Diez A√±os Despu√©s del Vertido de Aznalc√≥llar (Sevilla, 2008), Sal√≥n del Humor Er√≥tico de Cuba (Santa Clara, 2008), Hartos de Arte (Vitoria-Gasteiz, 2009), Maldita la gracia (Madrid, 2010), and Escolta Espanya! ep, que hi ha alg√∫?

The reserve encompasses almost all of the Taynish peninsula, which is around 5 km long and 1 km wide. The woodlands at Taynish are often described as a 'temperate rainforest', benefiting from the mild and moist climate brought about by the Gulf Stream. Taynish is owned and managed by NatureScot and was declared a national nature reserve (NNR) in 1977. The reserve was formerly also a biosphere reserve, but this status was withdrawn in 2014. NatureScot provide a car park and three waymarked trails for visitors, the Barr M√≤r Trail, Woodland Trail and the Coastal Trail. In 2015 it was estimated that around 9,500 people visited the reserve each year, down from a high of over 10,000 visitors in 2009/10. Flora Around three- quarters of Taynish NNR is wooded, dominated by ancient sessile oak woodland, with smaller areas of birch, alder and ash. During the nineteenth century the woodland was managed for charcoal production and to produce oak bark for the tanning industry. Trees were coppiced, and the woods were managed to favour the growth of oak over other species. The warm, wet climate, along with the humid woodland environment, provides ideal conditions for ferns, mosses and liverworts to thrive, with over 250 species of mosses and liverworts recorded at the reserve. Furthermore, 475 lichen species have been recorded at Taynish NNR, including 91 nationally scarce species. Other plants of note include the narrow-leaved helleborine, a United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) and Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP) species of orchid. Fauna The habitat mosaic at Taynish NNR gives rise to a large number of invertebrate species, including butterflies, dragonflies, moths, beetles and other groups of insects. One particularly noteworthy species is the marsh fritillary butterfly, one of the most threatened butterfly species in Europe. 450 species of moth have also been found at the reserve, three of which are UKBAP species, as well as 13 species of dragonfly. The reserve also supports a thriving otter population, which are regularly seen foraging down by the shore. Other mammals at Taynish NNR include red squirrels, pipistrelle bats and a very small resident population of deer. The range of woodland and mosaic of habitats at Taynish NNR also gives rise to a large breeding bird community, including six UK Biodiversity Action Plan species: reed bunting, spotted flycatcher, skylark, bullfinch, linnet and song thrush. Golden eagles, sea eagles and osprey have also been seen over the Taynish peninsula. Conservation designations The national nature reserve is classified as a Category II protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In addition to the NNR status Taynish also holds a number of other conservation designations, being designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) entitled Taynish Woods and forming part of the Taynish and Knapdale Woods Special Area of Conservation (SAC).} Taynish also lies within the Knapdale National Scenic Area. =Taynish Biosphere Reserve= Taynish was formerly designated as a biosphere reserve, however this status was withdrawn in 2014. The biosphere reserve designation has since been refocused to cover larger areas, subdivided into core, buffer and transition zones, and as of 2019 Scotland has two designated biospheres: Wester Ross, and Galloway and Southern Ayrshire. The listing noted the area's native mixed woodland, with wet and dry heath, grassland, and coastal ecosystems. As the biosphere designation was primarily concerned with the interaction between humans and the environment the economic uses of the wider area surrounding the NNR were also noted in the listing, these including the controlled grazing of beef cattle and sheep, forestry plantations, fishing (including creel fishing), and fish farming. It was noted that the area was popular with tourists, and harbours such as Crinan were used for commercial boat trips as well as pleasure cruises by private craft. Monitoring and research projects were a primary objective of the management plan for the biosphere reserve, as was education. A resource pack was issued to all local schools, and training was provided to primary school teachers, as well as land managers and workers.

Everest and the Dead Sea. Lokai bracelets carry elements from the highest and lowest points on earth - water from Mt Everest in the white bead, representing the high points in life, and mud from the Dead Sea in the black bead, signifying the difficult moments. These extreme elements provide a daily reminder of balance - to stay humble through those highs, and hopeful through the lows. The company donates 10% of net profits to charitable organizations.  Background  The brand launched in 2013 after Founder & CEO Steven Izen was on vacation with his family and received upsetting news that his grandfather had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. The experience of such joy and sadness so close together got him thinking about how important it is to stay balanced through any highs and lows one experiences on life's journey. The name \\"Lokai\\" was inspired by the Hawaiian word \\"L≈çkahi,\\" meaning the blending of opposites. Lokai.com officially launched in June 2013 with the Classic Lokai and has since grown to include several different product collections, which all serve as a daily reminder of balance. Today, Lokai reaches over 1.5 million followers on Instagram.  Awards & Recognition  The brand was a 2017 New York Winner of Smart CEO's Future 50 Awards. Steven was a finalist in the 2016 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Awards, named in the 2017 Forbes 30 under 30 list and is a member of the Make-A-Wish National Board of Directors.

Criticism  It has been questioned whether or not the beads actually contain water from Mt. Everest or mud from the Dead Sea. In response to such criticism, wearers resorted to cutting apart their bracelets to see if there is actually anything inside. Most wearers discovered there was actually some kind of mud and water inside, but some claim to have found just empty beads.

Seven people (including the perpetrator) were initially reported to have died, and eight more died later from their injuries, bringing the total to 15. At least 45 others were injured in the incident. The explosive device was contained in a briefcase. A second explosive device was found and defused at Ploshchad Vosstaniya metro station. The suspected perpetrator was named as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a Russian citizen who was an ethnic Uzbek born in Kyrgyzstan. Background In 2016, ISIL had plotted to target St. Petersburg due to Russia's military involvement in Syria, resulting in arrests. No public transport system in Russia had been bombed since the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings. ISIL propaganda was being circulated prior to this incident. It encouraged supporters to launch strikes on Moscow. ISIL propaganda showed bullet holes through Putin's head and a poster circulated before the attack of a falling Kremlin and included the message \\"We Will Burn Russia.\\" However, as some researchers have said, Russia faces a \\"sophisticated and complex\\" threat from domestic terrorism, linked to many different groups. Vladimir Putin was visiting Saint Petersburg, where he was born, on the day of the attack. Attack Location of the two stations and the tunnel in the Saint Petersburg Metro where the explosion occurred On 3 April 2017, a device containing of explosives detonated on a train travelling through a tunnel between the Sennaya Ploshchad and Tekhnologichesky Institut stations of the Saint Petersburg Metro. According to a statement from the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the bomb was detonated on the third carriage of the train. Eyewitnesses said the blast occurred near the door. Immediately after the explosion, smoke filled the platform. Video from social media showed multiple victims on the platform and a metal door twisted by the force of the blast. Following reports of the explosion, all metro stations in Saint Petersburg were quickly closed. In the late evening, metro services were resumed on Lines 3, 4, and 5. A second bomb was discovered and disarmed at Ploshchad Vosstaniya station. The device had ball bearings, screws, and shrapnel and was hidden within a fire extinguisher containing an equivalent of about of TNT. Jalilov's DNA was found on a bag which contained the extinguisher, suggesting that he intentionally left this bag inside a carriage as witnessed by some passengers. Aftermath Security was heightened after the attack. Metal detectors, installed countrywide following another metro attack seven years before, were all implemented after not having been in use for several years. The Moscow Metro security department said they were ready to assist the Saint Petersburg Metro in case of any help being needed. Local media reported that authorities had found suspicious packages in three Moscow metro stations, Nagatinskaja, Savelovskaya and Ugrezhskaya (CIP). Authorities later cordoned off the area. The security of Pulkovo International Airport was also heightened in response to the blast. A possible suspect was sighted on Metro surveillance cameras, according to unconfirmed reports. The Investigative Committee of Russia said the train operator's decision to drive it to the next station helped to avoid an even higher number of casualties. Two weeks later, FSB released a statement says that Russian security operatives have detained Abror Azimov (born 1990), the alleged mastermind of the bombing, in Moscow in which he trained the suicide attacker. Casualties As reported by the Russian Ministry of Health, approximately 50 people were injured, of whom 15 died (seven during the attack, eight later from their injuries). 39 people were hospitalised, of whom six had critical injuries. Children were among those injured. The fifteen people killed were identified as thirteen Russian citizens, a Kazakh man and an Azerbaijani woman. Perpetrator The suspected perpetrator behind the attacks was identified by Kyrgyzstan and Russian intelligence services as Akbarzhon Jalilov (sometimes spelled Akbarjon Djalilov), an ethnic Uzbek 22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Russian citizen. He was one of the 15 people who died during the attack. Jalilov was born in 1995 in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, and arrived in Moscow around 2011. According to Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets, Gazeta.ru reported he had worked as a cook at a sushi bar in 2015, while other sources claimed Jalilov had worked in a garage before disappearing weeks prior to the attack. Interfax said authorities believe he had ties to radical Islamic groups. Russian media has reported that he traveled to Syria in 2014 and trained with Islamic State militants. On 26 April, a group called the Imam Shamil Battalion has claimed responsibility the attack, and said that the bomber was acting on orders from al-Qaeda. The statement, posted by SITE Intelligence Group, said the bomber, Akbarzhon Jalilov, had acted on instructions from al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. In considering the incident, researchers had already illustrated that ‚Äòanalysis should not focus exclusively on recent developments and Daesh‚Äô, but rather look at the ‚Äòbroader context‚Äô including the ‚Äòrange of groups with which Central Asian radicals are involved.‚ÄôAfter St Petersburg: Russia and the Threat from Central Asian Terror Networks Mark Youngman and Cerwyn Moore, RUSI, 20 April 2017 https://rusi.org/commentary/after-st-petersburg-russia-and-threat-central- asian-terror-networks =Initial reports= On 3 April 2017, investigators said they believed the attack was a suicide bombing and identified a Central Asian as the suspected perpetrator. Some reports initially misidentified the suspect as a 22-year-old from Kazakhstan who was an IT student at St. Petersburg State University of Economics. He had been reported missing. This individual was later correctly identified as a victim of the attack. The suspect was later identified as a 23-year-old native of Kyrgyzstan with Russian citizenship and with links to international militant groups. The man with a beard wearing a skullcap contacted police to clear his name. Interfax later said only one person was involved. The man with the beard turned out to be a former paratrooper from Bashkortostan. Reactions =Domestic= President Vladimir Putin was in the city when the attack happened and pledged a thorough investigation. During an unrelated meeting with President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said they are \\"considering all possible causes, including terrorism.\\" He later visited the area of the attack, which was prohibited by the Federal Protective Service due to security concerns. This information was later denied by RIA Novosti. His statement was followed by Lukashenko expressing his sadness over the bombing. Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin expressed his condolences to the victims of the attack and ordered the strengthening of security measures around the capital's transport infrastructure, according to the Mayor's and city government's Press Secretary Gulnara Penkova. Head of the Ministry of Health Veronika Skvortsova instructed federal doctors to help doctors in St. Petersburg to assist the victims. The Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov called for the identification and punishment of the perpetrators. The All-Russian Union of Insurers said relatives of the victims will be able to receive 2.025 million rubles. A makeshift memorial was made to honour the victims of the bombing. Saint Petersburg declared three days of mourning in response to the attack. Mayor Georgi Poltavchenko, Governor of Leningrad Alexander Drozdenko, and President Vladimir Putin visited the site and laid flowers to pay respect. =International= Condolences and sympathies for those affected were offered by several international figures, including representatives of Algeria, China, the Czech Republic, Norway, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam, NATO, and the European Union. Ukraine tightened security around its metro stations in fear of an attack. = Other reactions = Tel Aviv city hall building was lit with the colours of the Russian flag. In Brussels, where a similar attack took place a year earlier, the ING Marnix building near the Throne metro station was also decorated with a moving Russian flag animation. At midnight (01:00 of April 5 in Moscow time), the lights of the Eiffel Tower were switched off to honor the victims. The Independent reported that some supporters of ISIL on unnamed internet forums linked the attack to Russia's support of Bashar al-Assad, and shared photos and video of people injured and killed by the blast.

Conceived in Hungary and developed in the United States in 2014, PanIQ Room became the first international escape room chain in the world with franchise disclosure documentation. As of November 2019, it had eighteen locations in the United States, Europe and Pakistan. History After a couple of isolated precedents across the world, a significant number of escape rooms first appeared in Budapest in early 2011. They soon became the top-ranked tourist attraction of the city. One of them was P√°niq Szoba, opened in March 2012 by Bal√°zs Koltai and managed by him and Bal√°zs Ureczky. In order to turn the concept of P√°niq Szoba into an international undertaking, several Hungarian entrepreneurs, including √Åkos G√°bossy, Patrik Horv√°th, G√°bor P√©teri and Patrik Strausz, partnered with the owners of P√°niq Szoba to found PanIQ Escape Room in 2014. The company entered the U.S. market as PanIQ Entertainment with two themes in Hollywood. When the rooms turned out to be a success, they opened their second U.S. location in San Francisco with three rooms: The Prison, Psycho and Geek. In 2017, PanIQ Escape Room officially became the first international escape room franchise in the world. The company is still responsible for the project design of all the rooms. In February 2016, a family-oriented MagIQ Room was opened in Beverly Hills, with three themes: Secrets of Wizardry, Pirate‚Äôs Den and Curse of the Mummy. As of November 2019, PanIQ Escape Room has fourteen franchise escape room units in the U.S.: three in Los Angeles (MagIQ Room, the initial U.S. location in Hollywood, and TwoBitCircus), two in San Francisco (Mission District and Lower Nob Hill), two in Chicago (Fulton Market and Logan Square), Phoenix, Washington, D.C., Miami, San Jose, Dallas, Houston, and New York City. Seven additional units are under construction: Atlanta, Las Vegas, Miami Beach, Atlantic City, Austin, Boston, and Hartford. As of November 2019, three units are currently operating in Europe: Budapest (called Neverland), Marseilles, and Stockholm. The original P√°niq Szoba is still in operation, but they are no longer part of the franchise, along with an affiliate location in Sydney, Australia. As of November 2019, one unit has opened in Asia in Islamabad, Pakistan and another unit is currently under construction in Nassau, Bahamas. Recent expansion and development has been the result of a Series A venture capital investment from Hiventures in the amount of US$875,000 in August 2018. PanIQ Escape Room is a member of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), International Franchise Professionals Group (IFPG), and International Franchise Association (IFA). Rooms The general objective of participants in each room is the same: to find a way to get out before the time runs out. In the Geek Room in Silicon Valley, startup employees are physically trapped in a room, with one hour to solve the puzzles. In 2016, the Geek Room was updated to add more drama, with players having to avoid explosives laid by their coked up boss. The San Francisco location also includes \\"Prison\\" and \\"Psycho\\" rooms. The PanIQ Room in Hollywood Hills has two rooms, with military bunker and lunatic asylum themes. Other popular themes are The Wild West in Phoenix, The Mob in Chicago and The Perfect Crime in Washington D.C. Role players, game designers, electrical engineers, carpenters, physicists, chemists and magicians take part in the designing and manufacturing of the games. Experimentation which is needed to get out of the rooms promotes teamwork. Google, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and other Fortune 500 companies have used PanIQ rooms as a team building exercise.

It provides a graphical interface in which the nodes or themes of analysis are represented by bubbles. It is designed primarily for new and non-academic users of qualitative data, to allow them to quickly learn the basics of qualitative data analysis. Although simpler to use, it lacks some of the features present in other commercial CAQDAS packages such as multimedia support. However, it has been proposed as a useful tool for lay and participant led analysis and is comparatively affordable. It is developed by Edinburgh, UK based Quirkos Software, and was first released in October 2014. The interface is unique, in that it simultaneously displays visualisations and text data and has identical capabilities on Windows, macOS and Linux. The thematic framework is represented with a series of circles, the size of each indicating the amount of data coded to them. Colors are used extensively to indicate the thematic bubble within the coding stripes on the text sources. There are few features for quantitative or statistical analysis of text data, however project files can be exported for analysis in statistical software such as SPSS or R. Quirkos is extensively used in many different fields which utilise qualitative research, including sociology, health, media studies, school of education and human geography. The developers claim use in more than 100 universities across the world. It has also been used in research for non-governmental organisations such as the Infection Control Society and UNICEF. However, the text management capabilities also can be used to assist in systematic literature reviews.

Biography and works Lamela was born in Madrid. He graduated from the Technical School of Architecture of Madrid (ETSAM) in 1954 and received his doctorate in 1959. From the beginning of his professional career he proved to be a visionary and innovative architect, the result of his great professional curiosity and much global travelling. * In 1954 he founded Estudio Lamela, the architecture firm where he has spent his entire professional career. * Between 1956 and 1958, he built the first residential building in Madrid that had air conditioning, individual rubbish chutes, interior ventilation shunts, mobile partition walls, complete exterior lighting, garden terraces, raised portals and suspended light fa√ßades. These elements, structures and design were absolutely new in those years. This building was followed by other modern buildings and residential complexes in the capital, and even entire neighbourhoods for thousands of inhabitants such as San Ignacio de Loyola. In 1960, he designed the first supermarket in Spain. * A pioneer in the area of Spanish tourist architecture, he designed the first motels and hotels in the country that had a contemporary conception and design. He participated in the tourist boom that began in the 1960s and created new residential complexes in coastal zones of the island of Majorca and the Costa del Sol.Antonio Lamela. Building la Caleta in Palma (Mallorca) * He was the first architect in Spain to develop the concept of \\"Office landscape\\", which applies to the headquarters of Estudio Lamela itself, then located at number 34 O'Donnell Street in Madrid.Antonio Lamela. Office and housing building in the O'Donnell 33 st in Madrid This work place introduced, among other novelties, the suppression of enclosed spaces and the incorporation of continuous ceilings with lighting and sound absorption panels, carpeted floors and walls and broken facades ‚Äì a set of techniques designed to achieve better solar and light control. * Lamela introduced in Spain the concept of \\"suspended architecture\\" with the Torres Col√≥n project in Madrid, undertaken together with the engineer Fern√°ndez Casado. The structural system of the towers was completely designed in reinforced concrete using high strength post-tensioned concrete. In this way, it departed from the most widespread technique of constructing \\"hanging\\" buildings, which usesheads of structural steel, to instead adopt a \\"suspended architecture\\" solution: the floor slabs are supported at their perimeter by the outer tie rods, which are not tensioned as in the case of the \\"hanging architecture\\", but compressed against the post-tensioned concrete structure of the head-beams. This upper structure, within which the installation machinery is located, receives the load from the 21 suspended slabs and transmits it to the core, through which it finally descends to the foundations in the ground. When they were built, the Col√≥n Towers heldthe world record for the number of suspended slabs, 21, using the pre-stressed concrete technique. The result is a building one hundred metres tallwith twenty suspended floors. The Eduardo Torroja Institute presented this project as a Spanish technological contribution at the World Congress of Architecture and Public Works held in New York in 1975, and it was considered \\"the building with the most advanced construction technology until 1975.\\" Torres Col√≥n as they looked when finished in 1976. * That sense of innovation and modernity led him to create in 1973 the first company of Integrated Project Management. It was called Gesti√≥n y Control and with it he sought to respond to this idea that he has explored from the beginning of his professional career: to propose a practice in which the architect controls all phases of the project. Responding to this same philosophy, he founded other companies related to his professional field such as ADI (Architecture, Decoration and Engineering), which offered services in which all three disciplines were integrated.Antonio Lamela. Hotel Meli√° Princesa in Madrid =Innovation in materials= In 1965 Antonio Lamela introduced ready-mixed concrete to Spain through the Prebetong brand. The company soon expanded into different geographical areas (Madrid, Aragon, Costa del Sol, Baleares and Canary Islands). In practice, they were the first concrete-mixer trucks to circulate on Spanish roads. In 1968 he started the company Shockbeton, dedicated to making pieces of architectural concrete. It was the first time in Spain that concrete prefabricated structures for facades were created, with results of great technical and aesthetic importance. Another of the leading companies that he launched in those years is CTC, a pioneering firm in the industrial supply of packaged bricks. =Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium and Terminal 4 of the Barajas Airport= In Madrid, Antonio Lamela concluded two reference works. The first was the remodelling and extension in 1988 of the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium (Lamela holds membership number 59 for Real Madrid Football Club).Antonio Lamela.

Antonio Lamela. Terminal 4 of the Barajas Airport =International organizations and publications= In 1976 Lamela founded in Spain the Club of Rome, an international organization that seeks to improve the world with tools such as education, social integration and the fair and equitable development of the planet. Antonio Lamela has written several books and publications, as well as numerous papers, writings and essays on land use, water policies, conservation of the environment, and even on the protection of the Spanish language. The architecture of Antonio Lamela is also a history of more than 1,500 projects and achievements of land use planning. Some have been collected in the book \\"Lamela: Urban√≠stica y Arquitectura. Realizaciones y Proyectos 1954-1992\\"as well as in the supplement \\"Proyectos y Realizaciones 1990-2003\\". His architecture narrates by itself an entire epoch of the history of Spain. Architecture has been for Antonio Lamela a path towards other disciplines. Humanist and thinker, he is the inventor of the new sciences \\"Geo√≠smo\\" and \\"Cosmo√≠smo\\", which he developed in the 1975 book of the same name. These new disciplines constitute a synthesis of urbanism on a planetary scale. In these books he advocated Sustainable architecture, at a time when that ecological term did not exist. At the time, Lamela defined it as \\"naturalism\\".

REV is intended to transform the way electricity is produced, bought and sold in New York and enable the integration of renewable energy generation and smart grid technologies on the electric grid. REV is ongoing with no predefined end date, and will impact all New York utilities and ratepayers. REV encompasses numerous policies and proceedings in the state of New York, as well as a restructuring of state utility ratemaking and revenue models. REV's utility reform component is part of a new trend toward utility reform that coincides with the drop in renewable energy prices.  Origins in the Cuomo administration  The Andrew Cuomo administration, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC), and energy policy lead Richard Kauffman announced REV in April 2014. When they introduced REV, the administration cited the need to modernize New York's utility infrastructure to be more resilient in light of the impact of Hurricane Sandy. They also cited trends such as the aging of the electric grid, the need to control energy prices, and the threat of climate change. In February 2015, the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) issued the REV Track One order, which adopted the official policy framework that serves as the basis of the REV proceedings.  Objectives  Overall, REV aims to make it easier for New York consumers and utilities to invest in distributed energy resources (DERs) and smart grid technology. Cuomo's administration hope that this shift will in turn create a more energy- efficient and resilient energy grid and a strong market for new energy technologies in New York State.  Utility ratemaking and revenue models  REV's utility reform proceedings are intended to change the way that electric utilities make money. Utilities will maintain their former status as energy distributors, but will also assume the role of \\"market operators,\\" facilitating transactions between those who provide energy and those who use it. Utilities will be incentivized to use DER in their grid planning efforts. In this new role, utilities will own the distributed service platform (DSP) that DER sellers and retail customers use to buy and sell electricity. REV envisions that current utilities in New York state will become a sort of ‚Äúmini-ISO‚Äù as it relates to DERs. Utilities will be incentivized to use DER in their grid planning efforts.  Process and timeline  New York's utilities are required to cooperate with the public service commission and other bodies to develop the new earnings mechanisms. The detailed and necessary actions that are required of all stakeholders to execute the goals of REV have only recently been more clearly defined. Many utilities are in the process of determining how they will respond the new policy. It is unclear how long the transition to the new model will take. The REV policy is being executed in two tracks. Both tracks seek to meet the same three goals: * Create a more diversified grid and business model that better integrates customers and third parties * Ensure that utilities are responsible for providing universal, reliable, resilient, and secure service at just and reasonable prices * Improve the overall efficiency of the system by combining utility and third party investment Track One is described in an order released on February 26, 2015 focuses on shaping the new utility vision and DER ownership challenges. Track Two described in an order released on May 16, 2016 focuses on the necessary changes in the current regulatory, tariff, market, and incentive structures.  Related initiatives and documents  The New York State Energy Plan is well integrated with REV and is intended to provide a roadmap for executing the REV policy. The New York State Energy Plan was released by the Cuomo administration in 2015. The Plan lays out New York's clean energy ambitions and includes the REV proceedings.  Ratepayer impacts and involvement  Governor Cuomo has cited ratepayer interested as part of the impetus for REV. Successful implementation of REV initiatives has the potential to save residents of New York state between $1.4 to $2.1 billion per year. State leaders are aware that low income customers and renters may be less likely to participate in distributed energy solutions like solar, that often require financing. As a partial solution, NY-SUN‚Äôs Community Distribution Generation program supports these customers. REV is also poised to make changes slowly such that utilities can remain profitable and effective operators of the grid through the transition. The creators of REV believe the new utility model will allow ratepayers to better manage their energy usage and reduce their energy bills. For example, implementing Time of Use (TOU) rates and creating transparency that shows customers how much they could save by shifting electricity usage to lower peak demand parts of the day. However, the costs of overhauling the current utility model could theoretically be passed down to consumers. One of the largest costs will be creating the two way grid to support DERs.  Impact  Supporters of REV reference Consolidated Edison‚Äôs (ConEd) Brooklyn/Queens Demand Management Program (BQDM) as an early success of REV. In place of requesting funds for capital expenditures to construct a $1 billion substation in Brooklyn to meet increasing load demand, ConEd utilized solar, batteries and energy efficiency solutions and was compensated in the same way a capital expenditure would be.  Challenges  New York‚Äôs current electricity grid is not currently set up to handle bi-directional resource generation. This is critical to the success of REV and must be resolved if REV policies are expected to be fully implemented.  Criticism  The Alliance for a Green Economy, an environmental group is advocating that the new DSP should be operated by an entity independent from the current utilities. They do not believe that allowing the current utilities to be responsible for the DSP platform will put customers on the same level playing field as the utilities.  Impact outside of New York  New York is a leader in taking steps to update the most common utility model currently used throughout the United States. Regulators, utilities and stakeholders in other states and jurisdictions are closely watching the progress of REV implementation. Seven states (California, Hawaii, Minnesota, Michigan, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Wisconsin) have open dockets related to utility business models.

Biography Born into a wealthy, Jewish, family in Cairo, his father was a realtor and tile factory owner, he was, nonetheless, educated in a Jesuit school, and, upon turning 18, travelled to Paris and Switzerland, in order to study art at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, eventually, in 1960, immigrating to Israel, where, after serving in the Artillery Corps, taking part in the Six-Day War, during the 1960s and 1970s, he gathered, around himself, a group of artists and intellectuals, calling itself \\"The Third Eye,\\" a commune, dedicated to lysergic acid diethylamide and cannabis, the ideas of Timothy Leary, and, bands such as Pink Floyd, The Moody Blues, and, Grateful Dead, which, included, amongst others, filmmakers and artists such as , , Amnon Salomon, , , and, . He considered himself to be strongly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche and the Marquis de Sade, as well as, by surrealism's artists such as Andr√© Masson and Hans Bellmer, Dada, the Situationist International's artists such as Guy Debord, the Beat Generation, Bernard Malamud, the band Faust, and, lettrism, and, eventually, changed his last name, on Avoth Yeshurun's suggestion, into a phonetic rendering of quatre mortes, French for \\"four deaths.\\" His apartment, located at Dizengoff Street 40 in Tel Aviv, where, eventually, his only film was shot, was a cornerstone of city life, during that time. He married translator, model, and, editor , daughter of poet Avoth Yeshurun, while, working on his highly avant-garde 1969 film A Woman's Case, in which, she starred, a time, during which, he met, and, cast into his film, model and it girl Ann Tochmeyer, most famous, during that period, for, appearing on the covers of magazines such as HaOlam HaZeh, which, he married, after divorcing his wife, after he finished the shooting. The film was a commercial failure, and, hindered his ability to pursue his career as a filmmaker. Other works included creating television programs showcasing the works of artists such as Moshe Gershuni, Yosl Bergner (1971), Yaacov Agam (1973), and, Michail Grobman (1974). Some years later, around 1974, he left Israel for Cambodia, Canada, and, Thailand, with Tochmeyer leaving for San Francisco, and, finally, later, around 1975, for Amsterdam, together with Tochmeyer, returning in 1991. Reportedly, while abroad, they both became addicted to cocaine and heroin, while, squatting in abject poverty, forcing him to work in pornography, and, Tochmeyer, to work as a stripper, while, essentially, living in a sort of open relationship, together with artist .

It is south of the city centre, Berhampore and New Zealand, and is in the Eastern Ward. Although adjacent to Lyall Bay, it does not have seafront access to the bay.  History  In 1879 the Melrose Estate was put up for auction. The land had belonged to Alexander Sutherland who died in 1877, and was sold to Mace and Jackson and then a syndicate known as Melrose Proprietors. Like James Coutts Crawford‚Äôs subdivision of the Seatoun township on the Miramar Peninsula, there were few buyers because of difficult access. Crawford's earlier auction of Kilbirnie sections in 1874 had attracted mainly speculators buying cheap land rather than would-be homeowners. The Melrose Borough was established in 1888 from the earlier Kilbirnie Road Board, to serve a horseshoe-shaped and largely rural area stretching from Upland Farm (later Kelburn) through Brooklyn and Island Bay and to areas later called Haitaitai and Roseneath. Initially it was to be called the Borough of Southend. The borough experienced rapid growth from the early 1890s, mainly in Kilbirnie, Brooklyn and Island Bay. Amalgamation with Wellington City would avoid large borough debt for amenities like drainage, water supply and a separate electric tramway system. Wellington City was planning an electric tramway system to replace the private horse tramways, and purchased them in 1902 (the first electric line was opened in 1904). In June 1902 a poll of Melrose residents agreed to join the Wellington City Council, and amalgamation proceeded in 1903. Extension of new electric tramway to the area plus water supply and sewerage was promised within three years, although held up by Island Bay \\"malcontents\\" wanting a firm commitment of a tramway extension to Island Bay. There was a \\"boom\\" in house construction in Melrose and Kilbirnie in 1907. In 2013 the population reached 1,215 in the 34 hectare land area. The Wellington Community Board boundaries splits Melrose between the Motukairangi/Eastern Ward and the Paekawakawa/ Southern Ward.  Notable Features  = Mt Albert = The water Melrose receives comes from either Waterloo or Wainuiomata, it makes its way under the Wellington motorway and is pumped into the Mt Albert reservoir. In 2016 the original 1910 810 litre tank was replaced with a 2.2 million liter tank built underground beside one built in 1955. The Wellington town belt reserve runs along the top of Melrose, backing on to the Wellington Zoological gardens. Mt Albert is part of this reserve and includes biking and walking opportunities along the Southern walkway. There is an off-leash dog exercise area part way up Mt Albert and a specialised mountain biking track has been built in the reserve by local volunteers. = Melrose Park = Melrose Park is located on Sutherland Crescent. Football is played here, there is an artificial surface for cricket and the park also contains a playground and changing rooms. = Truby King House = Truby King Park is off Manchester Street in Melrose, the homestead is now managed by Wellington City Council but was previously home to the founder of the Plunket Society and features many plaques and memorials to the work Sir Truby King and his wife Lady Isabella King undertook. Both are interred at a mausoleum on the 1.4 hectare site.  Activities  The Melrose suburb is part of the Predator Free Lyall Bay, Rongatai and Melrose group. Through backyard trapping, this group aims to help New Zealand native species become reestablished within Wellington.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) or SAANJHI) on 2 October 2014, Gandhi's birthday, in addition to Smart Cities and Digital India, as a development programme for India. The Parliamentarian's Model Village Scheme main goal is for each Member of Parliament and Minister to adopt a rural village and develop it into a model by 2019 under the SAGY guidelines. The vision of SAGY is a integrated village development plan, encompassing Personal, Human, Social, and Economic dimensions. Background Smart Village India gets its foundation from Mahatma Gandhi's vision of Adarsh Gram (model village) and Gram Swaraj (Village self-rule/independence). Gandhi in two texts, Hind Swaraj and Gram (Village) Swaraj, promotes the concept of integrated rural development to impact majority of the population, as the primary initiative after India Independence in 1947. The Eco Needs Foundation has initiated the concept of \\"Smart Village\\". Under this project the Foundation is adopting villages and putting efforts for sustainable development by providing basic amenities like sanitation, safe drinking water, internal road, tree plantation, water conservation. The Foundation is also working for inculcating moral values in the society and for improving the standard of living of the villagers. In the concept of \\"Smart Village\\" the development of the village shall be based on the five paths Retrofitting, Redevelopment, Green fields, e-Pan, Livelihood. Under the concept of Smart Village, the Foundation has adopted Village Dhanora, Teh. Bari, District Dholpur, a small and remote village of Rajasthan to develop it as India‚Äôs First Smart Village. The village is situated 30 km away from Dholpur district head quarter and 248 km from Jaipur. The population of the village is about 2,000. The village was devoid of its basic needs like sanitation, internal roads. It was also facing various other similar problems such as lack of access to potable water, non-availability of water conservation system, encroachment on the roads, power fluctuation, non- availability of employment oriented education, unemployment and poverty, so on and so forth. Prof. Priyanand Agale Founder of Eco Needs Foundation and Dr. Satyapal Sing Meena (IRS) Joint commissioner of Income Tax has converted this idea into reality and now Dhanora has become role model of Rural Development. Dhanora village was also given an award by Prime minister of India Mr. Narendra Modi in the year 2018. http://www.econeeds.org/rDevelopmentDetails.php?rdId=1&epType;=15\\\\. http://paper.hindustantimes.com/epaper/iphone/showpage.aspx?issue=91112016071900000000001001&page;=4&returnUrl;=http%253a%252f%252fpaper.hindustantimes.com%252fepaper%252fiphone%252fhomepage.aspx%2523_title91112016071900000000001001%252fwatitle91112016071900000000001001%252f9111%252f91112016071900000000001001%252f4%252ftrue&x;=0.8366013071895425&y;=0.8720173535791758 http://epaper.lokmat.com/lokmattimes/epapermain.aspx?queryed=78http://epaper.lokmat.com/epapermain.aspx?queryed=32http://m.bhaskar.com/news/RAJ- JAI-HMU-dhanora-smart-village-of-rajasthan-news- hindi-5374400-PHO.html?referrer_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.co.inhttp://epaper.bhaskar.com/detail/1085282/1182438312/0/map/tabs-1/11-08-2016/14/1/image/ Implementation by states The following states and territories participate in the programme.

Grandjean was not able to bring his manuscript to completion and a full revision of it was undertaken by Mr Charles Truman of the Victoria and Albert Museum who checked all the descriptions and marks, making a number of important additions which throw new light on the objects in question. He also contributed the introductory sections on the history of snuffing and the French system of hallmarks.\\" Gold Boxes and Miniatures of the Eighteenth Century, p. 7. His article \\"Reinhold Vasters, The Last of the Goldsmiths\\", published in Connoisseur in March 1979, dealing with fake Renaissance jewellery and works of art by the Aachen maker, reflected an important area of concern in his work as scholar and later as dealer.\\"It was Truman's 1978 revelations about Reinhold Vasters goldsmith from 1853-1890 that shattered the quiet world of antique jewelry [sic],\\" wrote Diana Scarisbrick in The Times, 10 November 1984.

Revolt  The British official administering the Griqualand West Colony was Sir Richard Southey, who wished to curb the diggers' independence. The revolt was led by Alfred Aylward. Other major players in the revolt were William Ling, Henry Tucker and Conrad von Schlickmann. The diggers were upset about high taxes, increased rent and coloured unrest. Aylward was pushing for a Republican form of government and preached revolution. He formed the Defense League and Protection Association and pledged action against taxation. Aylward inspired the diggers to take up arms in March and formed the paramilitary Diggers‚Äô Protection Association. A black flag was the signal for Aylward's supporters to revolt. William Cowie, a hotel owner, was arrested without bail for selling guns to Aylward without a permit. Aylward mounted the \\"black flag\\", the signal to revolt, in response to Cowies‚Äô arrest. The rebels blocked the prison upon the arrival of Cowie. Cowie was eventually acquitted. Southey asked for British troops to be sent to help control the situation. Volunteers from the Cape assembled to assist. The rebels held control of the streets for ten weeks. They surrendered upon the arrival of the British Red Coats on 30 June 1875. The rebel leaders were arrested and put on trial but were found not guilty by a jury. London was not happy with the way that Southey had handled the situation and the costs of sending troops, and he was removed from his position. The significance of the \\"Black Flag Revolt\\" was a victory for white interests, the end to independent diggers and signalled the rise of diamond magnates.

Hungary is represented in Kurdistan Region through a consulate general since November 2014, while Kurdistan Region has no representation in Hungary. Relations are characterized by several high-level talks and close ties. The Kurdish President Massoud Barzani visited Hungary in 2012 and in 2015 on official visits. Moreover, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n uttered support for the independence of Kurdistan Region from Iraq in 2015 causing concern among the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. From 2014 to 2018, Hungarian military ordnance to Kurdistan amounted to 250‚Äî275 tons of weapons including ammunition, and the Hungarian Chief of Staff of Defense Ferenc Korom used the word \\"loyalty\\" to describe the Hungarian-Kurdish military relations. History =Communist Hungary and Kurdish rebels= When Abd al-Karim Qasim ruled Iraq from 1958 to 1963, Communist Hungarian People's Republic began assisting Iraqis and the Kurdish minority with educational matters, and Kurdish students were allowed to study in Budapest. After the Ba'athist takeover in 1963, the First Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War intensified and many of the Kurdish guerillas of Kurdistan Democratic Party were sent for treatment to Hungary. This assistance continued under the Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish War from 1974 to 1975. In the same decade, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan was founded and held close diplomatic ties to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, both being members of the Socialist International. During the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, Hungarian ambassadors in Baghdad occasionally reported back to Budapest regarding the situation of the Kurdish guerillas against Saddam Hussein. =Strengthen of relations between Kurdistan Region and Hungary= Even though the autonomy of Kurdistan Region was established in 1992, ties between Kurdistan Region and Hungary were not strengthened until the Government of Viktor Orb√°n in 2012. In that year, Kurdish President Massoud Barzani led a delegation to Hungary, where they met Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n, President L√°szl√≥ K√∂v√©r, Foreign Minister J√°nos Martonyi, Economic Minister Gy√∂rgy Matolcsy and Deputy Speaker of Parliament Istv√°n Jakab to discuss ways to develop cooperation in various sectors, including investment, agriculture, education and energy. After the meeting, President Barzani stated that the meeting was an \\"important step towards establishing strong bilateral relations\\", while Martonyi described it as of \\"historical significance\\". The following year, Kurdish Foreign Minister Falah Mustafa visited Hungary to meet State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zsolt N√©meth to discuss political, economic, cultural, and educational ties. Hungarian Deputy State Secretary for Global Affairs P√©ter Wintermantel visited Erbil in April 2014, while a memorandum of understanding was signed between the two parties in November 2014. In this period, the Hungarian multinational oil and gas company MOL Group opened an office in the Kurdish capital of Erbil and has since developed a major oil field and purchased Kurdish oil. In 2016, MOL Group reached a deal with Kurdistan Region to relinquish its share in Akri-Bijeel block. Military aid to Peshmerga After the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) entered Iraq and captured Mosul during the Northern Iraq offensive, Hungary began aiding Kurdish soldiers (the Peshmerga) militarily. In August 2014, Hungary dispatched over 50 tonnes of ammunition to the Peshmerga, while 116 Hungarian soldiers were sent to Kurdistan to train the Peshmerga in September 2015. In December 2015, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ visited Kurdistan and pledged humanitarian aid worth US$300 million, whilst visiting the Hungarian soldiers stationed there. Hungarian Defence Minister Istv√°n Simicsk√≥ visited Kurdistan in May 2016 to discuss the war against ISIS and the ties between Hungary and Kurdistan. During his trip, he announced that 110 types of advanced weapons would be sent to Kurdistan. Hungary has also taken in dozens of Peshmerga for medical treatment. In November 2018, a Peshmerga delegation went to Hungary to expand the administrative and medical assistance. In the subsequent month, A delegation led by Chief of Staff of Hungary's defense Ferenc Korom visited Kurdistan to discuss the continuation of military support. Cultural relations To strengthen the ties between Hungary and the autonomous region, the main street in Rawanduz was renamed after the Hungarian revolutionary leader Lajos Kossuth. An anthology of Kurdish poems was also published in Hungarian by the state-funded Balassi Institute. In January 2017, Kurdistan Region offered scholarships for Hungarian students. Hungarian archeologists have also explored Kurdistan, with a geodetic survey of the Castle of Dwin near Erbil and an excavation mission in 2018 at Grd-i Tle in Ranya Plain. Hungary has also assisted in the rebuilding of the Chaldean Mariyama Private Elementary School in Kurdistan with $700,000.

Why research modern and contemporary art? # Because contemporary artists are now using a countless number of different materials, there is a need for research into how these materials will age and change with climate and temperature fluctuations. Since artists are constantly creating their work in new ways, research is required to keep up with determining treatment for all of these new materials. # Many artists today (and in the recent past) have used products that are commercially produced, and therefore, their formulas are carefully protected by the manufacturers. Conservators have a unique task in determining the nature of these materials, and also collecting samples to have available for when the product is no longer available. An example of this: house paint. # It has been determined that a number of modern materials are essentially unstable and show signs of deterioration much sooner than more traditional materials have. Some works have degraded so much that they are deemed worthy of storage only, and after a relatively short period of time. For this reason, there is a bit of a rush on figuring out how to best prevent this degradation, and to better track the changes that occur. # Time based media art: works of art that include electronics pose a particular challenge to conservators in that there is the impending threat that equipment or software will become obsolete. Conservators need to determine the best way to update the works of art to continue to make them viewable, while still maintaining the artist's intention for the work. # Many contemporary works of art are based more on a concept than on the physical object itself. Like the other challenges conservators are facing, this factor, more so than earlier works, forces the conservator to take the artist's intentions into account when determining the best course of treatment for a work. # Building off of the previous point, there is serious debate about whether or not the artist and/or the artist's estate should be included in conservation decisions. The issue poses ethical and legal implications, and the Getty has deemed this as a topic that needs further discussion and clarification. Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. (October 2013). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu.conservation/our_projects/science/modcon/overview.html. Main Goals of the Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative According to the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), those participating in this research initiative are intending to address the aforementioned concerns surrounding the conservation of modern and contemporary art in the following ways: # Conducting in-depth scientific studies into the synthetic materials being used today in an effort to better the understanding of how these modern materials behave. # Using a combination of scientific testing and critical assessment to develop and evaluate approaches to scientific conservation treatments. # Utilizing case studies that draw on collections of the collaborating institutions to gain a better understanding of the materials and methods of particular artists. # Organizing workshops for conservators to facilitate the transfer of scientific data into applicable conservation knowledge. # By organizing symposium meetings, debates, and publications, to continue the discussion on ethical and legal issues facing many conservators of contemporary art. # Using publications and web-based distribution, bettering the sharing of research ad information in this area with others in the field.

Current major research projects Though there are several challenges that face conservators with regard to modern and contemporary art, the CGI has focused its resources on three major areas that are in need of further research and information sharing. Because these materials and types of art objects are still rather new to the field, conservators have worked to identify the areas that require the most immediate attention. Currently, the three major projects focus on modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture.Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. (2013) The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modcon/overview.html. =Modern Paints Project= The Modern Paints Project is a collaborative research project that began in response to the various new materials that contemporary artists are using in their work. Major collaborators include the Tate London, The National Gallery in Washington, DC, the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute, and several other international and domestic museums and cultural institutions. After 1920, cellulose nitrate was successfully converted into a form that could be used as a paint binder. Following this, the paints that artists were using were constantly changing and were composed of synthetic binders. While these various paints were utilized by several artists in the 20th century and up to the present day, the knowledge regarding how well any of these modern paints would withstand the passing of time is still extremely limited. Research is needed to determine the extent of the probable deterioration. Learner, T., Schilling, M. & de la Rie, R. (2002). Modern Paints: A New Collaborative Research Project. Conservation Perspectives, 17(3). Retrieved from http://www.getty/edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/17_3/news_in_cons1.html. In 2004, Thomas Learner, a senior conservation scientist at the Tate, London, published the findings of his research into the types of techniques currently being used to test and learn more about the synthetic resins and materials used in many modern commercial paints. Learner, T. (2004). Analysis of Modern Paints. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Trust. Goals This project intends to increase in a significant and valuable way the amount of information available to conservators on modern paints, so that those working on objects of this sort are able to make informed decisions with regard to their treatments. This in-depth research will help conservators who study the techniques of modern painters. It also aims to assist them with determining the best storage and display conditions, and also contribute significantly to the development of safe and effective cleaning methods and other treatments. In order to do this, researchers monitor the behavior of actual art objects and conduct extensive analytical testing on materials. Modern Paints. (July 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/. Areas of focus 1\\\\. Assessment of analytical methods for modern paints: At the beginning of this project, there were very few methods established for identifying any of the components of modern paints, but by using several analytical techniques and scientific tests, conservators have been successful in being able to identify the binding agent, types of pigments, and additives in modern paints. Through this testing, the researchers have been able to select a number of testing techniques that are commonly used to make these identifications, giving them a better idea of how to move forward with future testing on objects. Modern Paints: An Assessment of Analytical Methods for Modern Paints. (July 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/modpaints_component1.html. 2\\\\. Study of the physical and surface properties of modern paints: Because these paints are still being identified, their physical characteristics are still somewhat unknown. This area of the project intends to determine how the newer materials will respond to changes in temperature and relative humidity. The methods for measuring these properties in changing environments are thermal analysis, mechanical analysis, and surface characterization. The main challenge here, despite the fact that almost all of the materials used are completely new, is keeping track of the huge amount of variation between paints and their physical makeups. Modern Paints: A Study of the Physical Characteristics of Modern Paints. (July 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty/edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/modpaints_component2.html. 3\\\\. Evaluation of cleaning methods for modern paintings: This main area of focus stems from the goal to develop an established method for cleaning modern paintings. Like the analysis of the environment responses, this area of focus consists of analytical testing to monitor any potential changes that could occur with cleaning treatments. The Tate London has worked closely with the Getty on each of these components of the project, but has played a leading role in this aspect in particular. Modern Paints: An Evaluation of Cleaning Methods for Modern Paints. (January 2009). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www,getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/modpaints_component3.html. Preservation of Plastics Project Like the Modern Paints Project, plastics are a new medium for conservators to deal with. The composition of the material is largely unknown, and the Preservation of Plastics project aims to help conservators understand why some plastics are more unstable than others. Research is required in this area because while degradation of plastics has been an ongoing issue in museums for several years, the main cause for concern is the rapid deterioration o the material with no obvious warning sign. Preservation of Plastics. (March 2010). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/plastics/index.html. =Goals= The main goal of this project is to develop strategies that improve the preservation and maintenance of objects in museum collections. Its aim is to coordinate scientific studies with the projects multiple collaborators to establish recommended practices for risks associated with handling these artifacts. Ibid. =Areas of focus= The larger POPART project involves five steps: # Identification of polymer artifacts # Collection survey # Polymer degradation assessment # Conservation # Dissemination The Getty Conservation Institute's project, the Preservation of Plastics, focuses specifically on coordinating the comparison of a wide range of analytical techniques for plastics identification and to participate in a details study into the physical and aging properties of a few key classes of polymer specifically. As with the Modern Paints project, if the conservators can learn more about these new materials being used, they can develop a procedure for how to treat them.Ibid. Outdoor Sculpture Research Project This project stems from the recognition that outdoor sculpture is by nature particularly prone to damage but that research in this area was lacking. Conservation of outdoor painted sculpture works is especially challenging, given the uncontrolled, and often harsh, environments to which works are constantly exposed. Collaborators on the project took a step back and looked at current interests, needs, and practices in the conservation of modern and contemporary outdoor painted sculpture. =Goals= The goals of this project, according to the Getty Conservation Institute are as follows: ‚Ä¢ Facilitate dialogue between professionals involved in the conservation of outdoor painted sculpture (conservators, paint chemists, paint industry, artists' estates, foundations, and studios, curators, and caretakers). ‚Ä¢ Create guidelines for the production of paint swatches, for the documentation of paint surfaces (gloss, color and texture), and for the sharing of such information among those involved in the preservation of outdoor painted sculpture ‚Ä¢ Collaborate with artists', estates, foundations, and studios (EFS) to develop guidelines on original paint surfaces related to their respective artists and best practices for production of EFS-approved coupons. ‚Ä¢ Develop paints specifically formulated for the field, with improved durability and suitable working and optical properties in collaboration with the Army Research Laboratory and the paint industry, and in consultation with conservators and EFS ‚Ä¢ Explore the possibility of carrying out local retouching to increase the duration between costly and invasive stripping and repainting campaigns ‚Ä¢ Carry out a number of case studies on outdoor painted sculpture and sculpture parks to explore bridges between theory and practice Over the long term the project seeks to build a repository of paint swatches documenting original paints and/or paints approved by EFS; to build bridges between industry and the conservation profession, and to disseminate the knowledge gained through courses and online publications. Outdoor Sculpture. (January 2015). The Getty Conservation Institute. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/outdoor/index.html. =Areas of Focus= 1\\\\. Documenting original paint sources: Outdoor painted sculpture is unique in that the paint is an important visual element of the object itself, but the paint also serves as a protection to the metal substrate of the object. The paint layer can also work to prevent corrosion of the metal underneath. As a result, when the paint chips or peels off, the sculptures are often repainted to both improve their appearance and protect them from the elements that they are exposed to. This proves to be an issue when the sculpture is repainted an incorrect color or finish, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and the work is changed from its originally intended appearance. For this reason, documenting the original paint source for a contemporary outdoor sculpture is considered a main area of focus of this project - this would give the conservators something to refer back to before conducting any further treatments. 2\\\\. Analyzing and understanding paint composition: Much like the Modern Paints Project, the type of paints used on outdoor sculptures are mainly commercial produced automotive or industrial paints, meaning that the complete composition of the paint is usually unknown to the conservators. For this reason, conducting testing on the paints used has been deemed essential in figuring out how to best treat these types of works. 3\\\\. Developing new paint systems: Although good paints with excellent performance characteristics are commercially available, they may not match all the requirements necessary for conservation treatment. To address these issues the GCI has partnered with the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), which has been working to investigate new paint formulations suitable for conservation‚Äîthe project builds off of previous work on matte black paints for Calder carried out by the ARL in collaboration with the National Gallery, Washington DC. 4\\\\. Collaborating with artists' estates, foundations, and studios: This area of focus is more of an ethical or philosophical discussion surrounding the involvement of artists' studios and estates in determining guidelines for repainting outdoor sculpture. Impact From its launch, the Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative has taken an expansive approach to its research efforts regarding modern and contemporary works of art. While focusing on learning about the behaviors of new materials, specifically polymers, resins, plastics, modern paints, etc., the GCI has also considered how to best share its discoveries with conservators working in the field.Learner, T. & Coddington, J. (2015). The Modern and Contemporary Art Research Initiative. Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/30_2/research_initiative.html. Along with its several collaborators, the Getty Conservation Institute has organized several conferences to disseminate its findings and continue to discuss the questions and issues surrounding modern paints, plastics, and outdoor sculpture conservation. In addition to meetings such as the Modern Paints Uncovered Symposium, hosted by the Tate Modern in May 2006, and the Object in Transition Conference held in January 2008, those involved with each project publish their findings in the Getty Conservation Institute's newsletters, as well as other conservation publications.

Becoming a courtier, he made the acquaintance of Geoffrey Chaucer, and became a poetic follower. Chaucer wrote a short poem Lenvoy a Scogan (1393). In 1399 Scogan was granted letters of protection to attend Richard II of England on his expedition to Ireland. Subsequently, he became tutor to the four sons of Henry IV. Scogan owned five Norfolk manors. When he died in 1407, he was succeeded by his son Robert. Works In William Caxton's and later editions of Chaucer's Works there appears \\"moral ballad\\" composed by Scogan, for the sons of Henry IV. According to John Shirley (c.1366‚Äì1456), Scogan interpolated in it three stanzas by Chaucer. Among manuscripts at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, there was a collection of metrical proverbs, headed Proverbium Scogani. It has been ascribed to Chaucer by John Urry, but also to Scogan. In literature Henry Scogan has been confused by some authors with John Scogan, jester to Edward IV, and possibly apocryphal. Shakespeare's mention of \\"Skogan\\" in 2 Henry IV, and Ben Jonson's character Scogan of The Fortunate Isles and Their Union, both partake of a composite myth; Inigo Jones made a sketch of Scogan for the use of the masque's actor.

List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements Many of the conflicts among the list of largest pharmaceutical settlements were because of off-label promotion. =Franklin v. Parke-Davis= In 1993, the FDA approved gabapentin, marketed by Pfizer under the name \\"Neurontin\\", only for treatment of seizures. Pfizer subsidiary Warner-Lambert illegally used scientific activities, including continuing medical education and research, to commercially promote gabapentin, so that within five years the drug was being widely used for the off-label treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions‚Äîconditions that had not been approved by FDA. In 2004, Warner-Lambert admitted to charges that it violated FDA regulations by promoting the drug for these off-label uses: pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses. The company paid $430 million to the federal government to settle the case.US Department of Justice Press Release: Warner-Lambert to Pay $430 Million to Resolve Criminal & Civil Health Care Liability Relating to Off-Label Promotion, retrieved 14 August 2006  Marketing of off-label use  Access to pharmaceutical industry documents has revealed marketing strategies used to promote drugs for off-label use. The United States federal government is aggressively pursuing criminal and civil cases against pharmaceutical companies and their employees for promoting off- label uses of prescription drugs.Erika Kelton, \\"Sales tactics, whistleblowers and qui tam lawsuits in the pharmaceutical industry\\" Between 2003 and 2008, U.S. federal prosecutors and state attorneys general brought more than a dozen cases against drug manufacturers for off-label marketing and won more than $6 billion in criminal and civil settlements. In September 2009, Pfizer paid $1.3 billion, the largest criminal fine ever imposed in the United States, for the off-label marketing of Bextra and three other drugs. Pfizer paid an additional $1 billion in civil penalties resulting from the same illegal activities. =First Amendment issues= The FDA takes the position that a drug manufacturer may not promote its drug for an unapproved use, and that any such promotion is false and misleading simply because it is not FDA-approved. However, many off-label uses are in fact effective and safe, as is evidenced by subsequent FDA approval of such uses for numerous drug products. The Supreme Court has in recent years begun to address the boundaries between government regulation of pharmaceuticals and the First Amendment free speech guarantee. Some legal observers have suggested that the trend in the Court's decisions may ultimately reduce the ability of FDA to prevent broader dissemination of off-label information about approved drug products. A three- judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan ruled on December 5, 2012 that a drug sales representative who was criminally prosecuted for making off-label promotional statements about Xyrem had suffered a violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.

She was previously the Acting Chief Justice of Delhi High Court.  Early life and education  Mittal was educated at Lady Irwin School in Delhi, graduating in 1975 with a focus on science. As a school student she was a member of the Girl Guides in India, and represented the organisation internationally at several events. She went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with Honours from the Lady Shriram College for Women, Delhi, in 1978, and also participated actively in athletics, acting as Sports President of the Lady Shri Ram College (1977-1978). Mittal studied law at the Campus Law Center in Delhi, graduating with an LL.B in 1981.  Early career  Mittal practiced law in Delhi from 1981 to 2004, prior to her appointment as an Additional Judge in the Delhi High Court. She also acted as a counsel for the Delhi Development Authority, appearing for them in a case concerning demolitions of illegal structures.  Judicial career  = High Court of Delhi = Mittal was appointed as an additional judge to the Delhi High Court on 16 July 2004, and was confirmed as a permanent judge on 20 February 2006. During her tenure as a High Court judge, she heard both civil and criminal matters. During her tenure as a High Court Judge, Mittal served on a number of administrative and judicial committees at the Court. She was the Chair of the Delhi High Court's Mediation and Conciliation Center, and served on committees that dealt with complaints concerning sexual harassment, working conditions, performance assessment of judges in subordinate courts, and judicial training. Mittal also served on a committee concerning the implementation of legal guidelines that governed child witnesses in cases concerning sexual offences. As part of this, she led an initiative to establish special courtrooms for vulnerable witnesses in the Delhi High Court, with the first such courtroom being established in 2012. On 14 April 2017, Mittal was appointed as the Acting Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.  Criticism in Times of India report  On 17 May 2016, the Times of India published an article reporting that a litigant had written to the Chief Justice of India and other judges of the Supreme Court, complaining that Justice Mittal's disposal of cases was slow and constrained by her involvement in administrative work, as a result of which she allegedly did not sit in court for a sufficient period of time to hear matters, and that this had personally affected the litigant. Times of India reported that they had verified the numbers presented by the litigant and confirmed them. Justice Mittal's office responded, indicating that the litigant had no pending cases in her court. The report was widely criticised by members of the Bar. The Delhi High Court Bar Association condemned it as inaccurate and thirty-four senior advocates wrote a letter to the Times of India calling on the newspaper to issue an apology to Justice Mittal for inaccuracies in their report, and attesting to her work at the Delhi High Court in disposing disputes. On 31 May 2016, it was reported that the Delhi High Court had accepted an unconditional apology from Times of India for the report.  Jurisprudence at the Delhi High Court  Mittal wrote a number of significant judgments as a judge at the Delhi High Court, many of which concern the conditions of service and recruitment in military and para-military forces in India. In 2011, along with Justice R. Midha she passed a significant ruling concerning the rights of transgender individuals, holding that a woman with a congenital hormonal anomaly had been unfairly discriminated against when she was prohibited from joining the Sashastra Seema Bal (a border patrol organisation) as a female constable. In 2013, along with Justice Deepa Sharma, she held that colour- blindness could not be a ground for discrimination in the context of promotion in the Central Reserve Police Force. In 2018, she held that advertisements prohibiting women from applying for recruitment to the Indian Territorial Army violated the Territorial Army Act, 1948, which allows men and women to apply. She has also served on the benches of several significant cases concerning political figures. In 2013, she held that Congress leader N.D. Tiwari could not be compelled to provide a blood sample against his will, in a paternity suit filed against him, although an adverse inference could be drawn from his refusal to provide the sample. Her order was later reversed by a different High Court bench, which compelled him to provide a sample. However, in 2016, along with Justice IS Mehta, she laid down principles that courts should follow in hearing cases concerning please for a court-ordered paternity tests. In 2014, along with Justice J.R. Midha, she dismissed an appeal filed in the Nitish Katara murder case, upholding the trial court's conviction of Vikas Yadav, the son of Uttar Pradesh politician D.P. Yadav. In 2017, along with Justice C. Hari Shankar, she dismissed an appeal filed by retired Calcutta High Court judge C.S. Karnan, in which he had challenged the constitutionality of the Indian Contempt of Courts Act. Mittal has also contributed to jurisprudence that focuses on constitutional rights. In 2013 she ruled that the Delhi High Court could not prohibit entry to persons who didn't have identity cards, noting that access to justice would be impended by such a rule. In August 2018, she and Justice C. Hari Shankar found that the provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 were largely unconstitutional, and struck it down. = High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh = On 3 August 2018, Mittal was appointed as Chief Justice of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir. She is the first female Chief Justice of that court.  Appointment of additional judges  In 2019, Mittal wrote to the Supreme Court of India calling for the appointment of additional judges to handle the caseload at the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, noting that the Court was functioning at half its judicial capacity with only ten judges serving instead of the allocated seventeen. Justice Mittal forwarded seven names for the consideration of the Supreme Court collegium, which appoints judges to the High Courts in India. In April 2020, three additional judges were appointed to the Court, bringing the total number of serving judges to thirteen.  Creation of CAT Bench in Jammu and Kashmir  In May 2020, Mittal wrote to the Government of India in her capacity as Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, calling for the establishment of a bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal in Jammu and Kashmir, to hear cases concerning the service conditions of officers in the Indian Administrative Service. In her letter she noted that the passing of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act 2019 had resulted in the need to transfer a number of pending service matters from the High Court to such tribunals. The publication of her letter met with opposition from the Chairman of the Central Administrative Tribunal, Justice L. Narasimha Reddy, who disputed the need for a separate bench in Jammu and Kashmir at that time. In April 2020, the Central Government issued a notification extending the jurisdiction of the Chandigarh bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal to Jammu and Kashmir; however, following criticisms that this would cause difficulties in access, the Government modified its order to create a separate Central Administrative Tribunal bench in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.  Jurisprudence at the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir  On 25 October 2019, Mittal authored a significant judgment in Suhail Rashid Bhat v State of Jammu and Kashmir, striking down the Jammu & Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960, a law drawing from colonial legal principles to penalise poverty and public movement. Along with Justice Rajesh Bindal, she held that the criminalisation of beggary violated constitutional principles and constituted a ‚Äúdisproportionate infringement of the right to meaningful life, dignity, privacy and liberty guaranteed under Article 21‚Äù. = Tribunals and regulatory bodies = Mittal has served as a member of the Advisory Board constituted under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Act, 1974 (COFEPOSA). In February 2008, she was appointed as the sole judge in a tribunal constituted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 to investigate a ban on the activities of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). As judge, Mittal found that the government did not have grounds to enforce an extension of a previous ban against SIMI, as it had failed to present new evidence to support its argument for the extension. Her decision was stayed soon after by the Supreme Court, allowing the ban on SIMI to continue.  Other activities and awards  Mittal has served on the governing boards of several educational institutions. She has been a member of the Governing Council of the National Law University, Delhi since 2008, and Governing Council of the Indian Law Institute, New Delhi since 2013. She was a member of the Delhi University Court from 1999 to 2004, and was nominated to the governing body of Ram Lal Anand College in Delhi from 1997 to 1999. Justice Mittal also serves on the editorial advisory board of the National Law University Delhi's Journal of Legal Studies. In 2008, the Vice President of India, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, awarded Mittal with the 'Distinguished Alumna Award' from Lady Shriram College, recognising her contributions to jurisprudence. In 2019, she received the Justice P.N. Bhagwati Award for her contributions towards improving access to justice and for her work in designing and introducing special courts for vulnerable victims in the Delhi High Court. = Criticism concerning Nari Shakti Puraskar = In 2017, Mittal was one of the recipients of the Nari Shakti Puraskar, a civilian honour presented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development of the Government of India to individuals and organisations contributing to female empowerment. Her acceptance of a government award while serving as a judge led to public criticism and concerns about conflicts of interest and the independence of the judiciary, particularly as it was the first instance of a sitting judge accepting an award from the government. Several advocates and retired judges noted that prior to this, only retired judges had accepted government awards, and argued that her acceptance of a government award ought to disqualify her from hearing cases in which the government is a litigant.

It is variable but easy to recognize because the stipe soon becomes distinctively tough, bloated and ridged. Naming This species was originally described by Bulliard in his 1793 \\"Herbier de la France\\" as Agaricus fusipes at a time when all gilled mushrooms were assigned to genus Agaricus. Then in 1821 Samuel Frederick Gray published his \\"Natural Arrangement of British Plants\\" (including fungi) in which he allocated the species to the already existing genus Gymnopus. However Gray's book was not very popular and in 1872 Lucien Qu√©let put this mushroom in genus Collybia, giving it the name Collybia fusipes by which it was generally known for many years. In much later work culminating in 1997, Anton√≠n and Noordeloos found that the genus Collybia as defined at that time was unsatisfactory due to being polyphyletic and they proposed a fundamental rearrangement. They resurrected the genus Gymnopus for some species including fusipes, and after subsequent DNA studies, this has been accepted by modern authorities including Species Fungorum and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and so its current name has reverted to Gray's combination, Gymnopus fusipes. There was also an alternative move to reclassify it under Rhodocollybia, but that has not generally been accepted. G. fusipes is the type species of the genus Gymnopus. The species name fusipes indicates that the stem is spindle-shaped (from the Latin fusus meaning \\"spindle\\" and pes meaning \\"foot\\"). The English name \\"Spindle Shank\\" has been given to this species. Earlier in 1821 Gray had already given it the English name \\"Spindle naked-foot\\", but that suggestion never gained much popularity. Description This mushroom is very variable, though it is easy to recognize on close examination, at least when not young, due to the distinctive tough stem. The following sections use the given references throughout. =General= *The cap, growing from about 3 cm to 10 cm, is smooth and dark red-brown, or may be paler, sometimes with dark spots. *There is no ring or other veil remnant. The red-brownish stem is often lighter at the top and can grow to about 15 cm long, sometimes rooting. At least when older the stem typically becomes inflated and deeply furrowed and also develops a distinctive tough consistency. Sometimes a new clump of these mushrooms grows from the stem bases left from the previous year. *The usually well-spaced gills are whitish and may be flecked with spots. Illustration by M. C.Cooke =Microscopic characteristics= *The ellipsoidal spores are around 4.5-6 Œºm by 3-4.5 Œºm. *Clamp connections are present in all parts of the fungus. =Distribution, habitat & ecology= This mushroom grows in often large clumps at the base of trees, or on roots or stumps. It is always associated with wood, which may however be buried and not immediately visible. Its main host is oak, but sometimes it is also found on beech. This mushroom is saprobic on dead wood and it is also a serious parasite. Appearing from summer to autumn, it is distributed throughout Europe, where it varies locally between quite common and quite rare. Also the fungus is spreading as a disease to North America, particularly on Northern Red Oak. Human impact Most authors do not consider this species worthwhile for the table, but although this mushroom soon becomes tough, the caps (only) are said to be edible and good when young. Note that with its resistant texture G. fusipes can often appear collectable after several months of growth, but due to the normal development of organisms of putrescence during that time, such specimens could cause gastro-enteritis. Any rancid smell is a sign that the mushrooms are too old. It is a serious parasite of oak trees, causing a root rot.

She was the first woman to receive a Doctor of Education degree from Harvard University. She called out the poor system in Australia and her reputation was ruined by the minister responsible. Early life Hodgkinson was born on 13 May 1887 in South Yarra, a suburb of Melbourne, to Ada Josephine (n√©e Edmiston) and Albert James Hodgkinson, a sugar planter. The family later moved to Lennox Head, New South Wales, and after her father's death, Lorna and her mother moved again to Perth. After studying at the Perth Girls' School, she began working as a student teacher in 1903. Career Hodgkinson became an assistant at the Perth Infants' School in 1907 and started a class for children with intellectual disabilities. She left Perth in 1912 to move to Sydney, where she taught at various public schools until 1915. In 1917 she began working at May Villa in Parramatta, teaching intellectually disabled girls who were wards of the state. She was granted paid leave in 1920 to study at Harvard University; she received a Master of Education degree in 1921 and her Doctorate of Education in 1922. With her doctoral thesis, \\"A State Program for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Atypical Children in Public School Systems\\", she became the first woman to receive the degree of Doctor of Education from Harvard. When Hodgkinson returned from Harvard to Sydney in 1922, she took up a position created for her by the NSW Department of Education: Superintendent of the Education of Mental Defectives. In 1923 she testified before the Royal Commission on Lunacy Law and Administration that the system for caring for intellectually disabled children was mismanaged; her comments sparked protests from the public and a ministerial inquiry was ordered by minister Albert Bruntnell. Hodgkinson was accused of falsifying her educational record in order to gain admission to Harvard, and after the inquiry found against her on all accounts, she was suspended for \\"disgraceful and improper conduct in making false statements and pretences\\". She was demoted to normal public teaching in 1924, but she refused to take up her new position and was dismissed. The dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education later wrote a statement to confirm her abilities and achievements. After being publicly humiliated, Hodgkinson left the public education system and founded the Sunshine Institute, a residential school for intellectually disabled children, in the Sydney suburb of Gore Hill. She worked there for the rest of her career, building the school up from six to sixty pupils. She gave lectures on \\"mental hygiene\\" on the radio, wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald, and addressed the Women's Reform League and the Australian Racial Hygiene Congress. Death Hodgkinson died of cancer at Gore Hill on 24 March 1951. The Sunshine Institute was later renamed the Lorna Hodgkinson Sunshine Home, and is still in operation as Sunshine.

The chronicler Abdi Pa≈üa estimated that the fire destroyed 280,000 houses and burned for approximately forty-nine hours. During the reconstruction of the city, the Ottomans enacted unprecedented policies concerning Christian and Jewish houses of worship. In previous periods, the Ottomans had usually allowed the rebuilding of churches and synagogues. However, in this period they applied Islamic laws prohibiting reconstruction. Background On July 24, 1660, there was a great fire in Constantinople. It destroyed two thirds of the city. Seven synagogues and at least 25 churches burned to the ground. Contemporary sources have written that thousands of homes were caught in the blaze. The fire began west of Emin√∂n√º and destroyed densely populated neighborhoods with old-fashioned wooden homes. Abdi Pa≈üa tells us that the fire \\"marched across the city like an invading army.\\" Contemporary sources estimate that 280,000 homes were destroyed and 40,000 lives were lost in the conflagration. Aftermath Marc David Baer has written that imperial mosques in the Ottoman Empire marked the boundaries of Ottoman territory and supported political and hegemonic interests. The Yeni Valide Mosque or New Mosque project had started while Mehmed IIIs mother, Safiye Sultan, was Valide Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, but the project was abandoned for several decades after her death. Construction of the site's foundation had initially started on land that had been taken from the non- Muslims in the area of Emin√∂n√º in Constantinople, but they had started to return to nearby areas. The imperial family remained uninterested in completing the New Mosque project until the fire destroyed the entire area between Unkapanƒ± and Emin√∂n√º in 1660, after which the non-Muslim population was once again deprived of their properties. When the government began to rebuild the city a ban was issued forbidding the reconstruction of churches and synagogues. The young Grand Vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed invited the Kadizadeli preacher Vani Mehmet Efendi to Constantinople. Upon Vani's advice, the sultan forbade consumption of tobacco, coffee and alcohol and insisted on strict enforcement of Islamic law. He destroyed Sufi tombs and either exiled or executed Sufi leaders. Vani claimed that the disproportionate destruction of Jewish property in the Great Fire was a sign of divine displeasure. He supported legislation barring them from returning to the area. K√∂pr√ºl√º Fazƒ±l Ahmed confiscated all the lands where synagogues had stood and auctioned them. Non-Muslims were forbidden from bidding on the properties. Turhan Sultan sponsored the construction of the New Mosque. It opened in 1665 and Vani Mehmet Efendi became its first preacher. After a time, Christians were allowed to buy back the land where churches had stood and rebuild them. The rebuilt churches were officially listed as residential buildings.

It covers the islands of Inchcailloch, Clairinsh, Torrinch, Creinch and Aber Isle, alongside areas of woodland and wetlands to either side of the mouth of the Endrick Water.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. Foreword. NatureScot owns two parts of the reserve - the island of Inchcailloch and part of Gartfairn Wood - and the rest is privately owned. The reserve is managed by a partnership consisting of NatureScot, the RSPB Scotland and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, along with the owners and tenants of the land under agreements.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 1. Within this framework NatureScot directly manage the islands of Clairinsh, Inchcailloch, Torrinch and Creinch, and land to the north of the Endrick Water. The RSPB manages the area to the south of the Endrick Water, and the National Park manages visitor facilities on Inchcailloch. The first part of Loch Lomond to be declared a national nature reserve was Clairinsh in 1958; the reserve was subsequently extended three times to reach its present size.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 16. The reserve encompasses a wide range of habitats, including woodlands, open water, grassland and wetlands. Due to its position on the Highland Boundary Fault, the varying natural environments of the highlands and lowlands give rise to habitats and species at both their northern and southern limit. Prior to becoming an NNR, the land was used for farming, producing woodland and to a lesser degree, for recreation. Some of these practices are still used, but now with a stronger focus on wildlife practices and maintaining the diversity of the area. Flora and fauna There are several different habitats present on the reserve. The islands, and the northern part of the mainland section consist of Atlantic oakwoods, a type of woodland found along the Atlantic fringe of Europe in areas with high rainfall. These woods consist predominantly of oak trees, but other species such as ash, elm and alder are also found. Atlantic oakwoods are characterised by their lichens and mosses, which thrive in the damp conditions, and support many species of plants and birds.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 6. The makeup of woodland on each island, and on the mainland section, differs slightly, adding to the diversity of habitats at Loch Lomond NNR. Much of the mainland section of the reserve is the flood plain of the Endrick Water, and so consists of wetland habitats such as swamp, mire, fen, marsh, reed bed, wet woodland and wet meadow. Unlike many other European rivers the Endrick has not undergone drainage or flood defence schemes: this considered to be a key factor underpinning the importance of the site from a nature conservation point of view. Due to the diverse range of habitats present, the reserve is considered to be a ‚Äòhot spot‚Äô for plant life. Nearly 400 vascular plants have been recorded here, representing around 25% of all the species found in Britain. A number of rare plants are found at the reserve, including elongated sedge, six-stamened waterwort, cowbane, summer snowflake and mudwort.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 10. The diverse range of habitats also supports an abundance range of invertebrates, including beetles, dragonflies, damselflies, and moths, although relatively few rare or scarce species have been found. Loch Lomond NNR supports a wide range of bird species. During the winter months large numbers of geese migrate to the reserve, including over 1% of the entire global population of Greenland white- fronted geese (around 200 individuals), and up to 3,000 greylag geese. The reserve is also important for breeding birds during the summer months, with the islands supporting an exceptionally high density of breeding insect-eating species such as pied flycatchers. Other species breeding here include grasshopper warblers, sedge warblers, reed buntings, redstart, spotted flycatchers, skylarks, buzzards, and snipes. Ospreys are regularly seen at the Endrick Mouth section of the reserve, and crake may also be present.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 8.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 9. Capercaillie were formerly present on the reserve, but as of 2018 were no longer to be found. Loch Lomond itself hosts populations of powan, whilst the Endrick Water supports brook lamprey and Atlantic salmon. The reserve hosts an important population of river lamprey, which display an unusual behavioural trait not seen elsewhere in Britain: unlike other populations, in which young hatch in rivers before migrating to the sea, the river lamprey of the Endrick remain in freshwater, heading for Loch Lomond as adults. Otters live along the shore of the loch, especially along the mainland section of the reserve.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 11. Conservation designations Loch Lomond Nature Reserve. Adjacent to the River Endrick The national nature reserve (NNR) holds a number of other overlapping conservation designations. The Endrick Mouth and Islands Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is almost directly coincident with the NNR, whilst the Portnellan - Ross Priory - Claddochside SSSI overlaps with the NNR at the western edge of the mainland section. The Endrick Water Special Area of Conservation (SAC) covers the Endrick Water, including the section through the NNR, and the Loch Lomond Woods SAC includes the islands of Inchcailloch, Clairinsh, Torrinch and Creinch. These islands, and the area of the NNR to the south of the Endrick Water, form the Loch Lomond Ramsar site. Most of the mainland portion of the NNR also forms part of the Loch Lomond Special Protection Area (SPA). The NNR is classified as a Category IV protected area by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Islands within the reserve =Aber Isle= Aber Island, near the mouth of the River Endrick, has the only hornbeams in the area, and is also home to many guelder roses.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 7. =Clairinsh= Clairinsh is considered to have some of the most natural woodland in the area, and was the first part of the current NNR to receive the designation. It is notable for the age structure of its oak trees, which range between 21 and 165 years old,The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 37. and also the remains of a crannog, which can be seen offshore. =Creinch= The woodland of Creinc is notable for its large coppiced wych elms and mature ash trees, whilst its shoreline supports plants such as globeflower, columbine and goldilocks buttercup. =Inchcailloch= Inchcailloch (thought to mean \\"island of the old or cowled woman\\") is renowned for its natural and cultural heritage. There are many traces of past human settlement around Loch Lomond NNR and one particularly noteworthy example is the 13th century church on Inchcailloch, which is the only scheduled monument in or around Loch Lomond. Other interesting historical remains on Inchcailloch include the drying kilns and a ruined farm. The island is the main attraction for visitors to the reserve, receiving 15,000 people each year. Most visitors arrive by ferry from Balmaha, although some also arrive in their own boats. The island has a network of paths good path network, a picnic area, a campsite and toilet facilities: these facilities are managed by the National Park Authority.The Story of Loch Lomond National Nature Reserve. p. 19. =Torrinch= The woodland on Torrinch consists of more birch than the other islands; it also hosts some aspen.

List * Actiq (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate), a controlled substance, is used off-label to treat moderate to severe chronic, non-malignant pain even though it is approved in the United States solely for breakthrough pain in cancer patients. * Bevacizumab (Avastin) has been used against wet age-related macular degeneration, as well as macular edema from diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion. *Buprenorphine has been shown experimentally (1982‚Äì1995) to be effective against severe, refractory depression. * Bupropion, when sold under the brand name Wellbutrin is indicated for depression. It is also sold as a smoking cessation drug, under the name Zyban. In Ontario, Canada, smoking cessation drugs are not covered by provincial drug plans. Thus, a physician can write a prescription for Wellbutrin to assist with giving up the habit of smoking. Sometimes it is also prescribed as second-line treatment of ADHD, often in combination with the stimulant being used, but it was also shown to work on its own as a norepinephrine‚Äìdopamine reuptake inhibitor. It is also given to counter SSRIs' negative effects on the libido, anorgasmia and anhedonia. * Carbamazepine, or Tegretol, has been used as a mood stabilizer and is accepted treatment for bipolar disorder. * Colchicine (Colcrys) for pericarditis: colchicine is indicated for the treatment and prevention of gout, though it is also generally considered first-line treatment for acute pericarditis, as well as preventing recurrent episodes. Although the exact mechanism of colchicine is not fully understood, its anti-inflammatory effect for pericarditis appears to be related to its ability to inhibit microtubule self-assembly, resulting in decreased leucocyte motility and phagocytosis. Other non-FDA-approved uses include actinic keratosis, amyloidosis, Peyronie's disease, and psoriasis. * Dexamethasone and Betamethasone in premature labor, to enhance pulmonary maturation of the fetus. * Doxepin has been used to treat Angiodema and severe allergic reactions due to its strong antihistamine properties. * Gabapentin, approved for treatment of seizures and postherpetic neuralgia in adults, is used off-label for a variety of conditions including bipolar disorder, essential tremor, hot flashes, migraine prophylaxis, neuropathic pain syndromes, phantom limb syndrome, and restless leg syndrome. * Propranolol (Inderal) for performance anxiety: propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used for the treatment of hypertension and the prophylaxis of angina pectoris. In 1991, a published study showed that a single dose of propranolol immediately before the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) significantly improved performance in high school students prone to cognitive dysfunction due to test anxiety. In addition to test taking, propranolol has been tested for public speaking, performing surgery, musical recitals, and sports, all with varying degrees of benefit. Other off-label uses for propranolol include the treatment of thyroid storm, portal hypertension, and neuroleptic-induced akathisia. * Magnesium sulfate is used in obstetrics for premature labor and preeclampsia. * Methotrexate (MTX), approved for the treatment of choriocarcinoma, is frequently used for the medical treatment of an unruptured ectopic pregnancy. There is no FDA-approved drug for this purpose and there is little incentive to sponsor an unpatented drug such as MTX for FDA-approval. *Misoprostol is approved for medical abortion regimens when administered at the office, but clinicians often give abortion patients the drug to be taken at home. * Retigabine (INN) is an anticonvulsant used as an adjunctive treatment for partial epilepsies in treatment-experienced adult patients. Currently, it is being tested in the treatment of Tinnitus. * The SSRI medication sertraline (Zoloft) is approved as an anti-depressant but is also commonly prescribed off-label to help men suffering from premature ejaculation. Low-dose naltrexone is cheap without side effects and used to cancer and autoimmune diseases like Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. * Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, is used to treat ejaculatio praecox, and may also be applied against restless legs syndrome. * Prazosin (Minipress) for nightmares: prazosin is approved for the use of hypertension. A 2012 systematic review showed a small benefit for the treatment of PTSD-associated night terrors. Other non-FDA-approved uses for prazosin include the treatment of Raynaud's disease and poisoning due to scorpion venom. * Clomiphene (Clomid) for male infertility: clomiphene is approved for female infertility due to ovulatory disorder. * Memantine (Namenda) for OCD: memantine is approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. * Clonidine (Catapres) for ADHD: clonidine is approved and commonly used for the treatment of hypertension. Other off- label uses include cancer pain, hot sweats, certain psychiatric disorders, nicotine dependence, opioid withdrawal, migraine headaches, and restless leg syndrome. * Quetiapine (Seroquel) for insomnia: quetiapine is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. * Naltrexone (Revia) for behavioral addiction: there is some belief that low-dose naltrexone may benefit the treatment of cancer, HIV, and multiple sclerosis by ‚Äúnormalizing‚Äù the immune system; however, data is lacking.

Flink, who has been a columnist and editor with such magazines as World Tennis Magazine, Tennis Week and Tennis Channel and published two monographs on the history of tennis, in 2017 was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame in the Contributor category. Flink was born in the New York City and became a fan of tennis in 1965, at age 12, when his father Stanley took the boy to the Wimbledon Championships. Later the same year Steve for the first time watched the US National Championships in New York. Flink himself recalls that as 15 years old he has already decided to become a tennis reporter. While still a boy, he also developed an interest in sports statistics. In 1970, Flink moved to England where he began studying at the U.S. International University in Sussex. During his college years, he took part in student tennis competitions, showing remarkable consistence and \\"well rounded game\\" according to the team brochures. His father introduced him to future International Tennis Hall of Famers Bud Collins and John Barrett. In 1972 Collins, who was aware of Steve's flair for statistics and historical facts, hired the youth to help him at Wimbledon and the US Open. Steve was feeding Collins various facts and statistics during his reportages. The same year Flink first met Jack Kramer, who later became one of his mentors. In 1973 Flink interviewed Chris Evert and sold the story to the World Tennis Magazine. After publishing another story in 1974 in the same magazine he was offered a permanent job by its owner Gladys Heldman. Flink's collaboration with World Tennis continued until 1991, and he took the positions of a columnist and an editor with this magazine. Since 1982 he has also covered the Wimbledon Championships and the French Open for CBS Radio (where he worked for more than 25 years), in 1970s and 1980s worked as a statistician for CBS, NBC and ABC telecasts and in 1980‚Äì1996 was a color commentator for ESPN and MSG. From 1992 to 2007 Flink was a senior correspondent for Tennis Week, and since 2007 he works as a columnist for the online magazine Tennis Channel. As a tennis historian, Flink wrote two reputable monographs: The Greatest Tennis Matches of the 20th Century and The Greatest Tennis Matches of All-Time. In addition, for 12 years he was creating biographical portraits of players for John Barrett's annual book World of Tennis.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. It is the only hotel remaining in the Boyne area dating from the turn-of-the-century era when Boyne City was a booming lumber town. History At the turn of the 19th century, Boyne City was the lumber capital of northwest Michigan. Related businesses opened their doors in Boyne City, employing more and more men. As the new century progressed, the city grew rapidly, from 912 residents in 1900 to 5995 residents in 1910. In 1911, a group of Boyne City residents felt the city needed a high-class hotel, a notch above the half-dozen hotels already established in the city. Forty-six residents formed the Boyne City Hotel Company, and commissioned a building to be called the Wolverine Hotel. They hired Price Brothers from East Jordan, Michigan, to construct the building. The hotel opened on February 1, 1912. However, by the end if World War I, the timber in the area had been depleted. Businesses around Boyne City closed and residents moved. In 1936, the hotel was purchased by Wesley Dilworth, who renamed it the Dilworth Hotel. During the 1930s and 1940s, the Dilworth became known nationally for hosting the annual Boyne City Smelt Run Banquet. Dilworth sold the hotel in the mid-1940s. The hotel changed hands multiple times, and by the 2000s was struggling. It closed in 2008. The building was purchased by an investor in 2013, with plans to rehabilitate the building. The project received a $1,000,000 grant in 2015, and when completed will have 26 hotel rooms, a restaurant, a banquet room and a pub. Description The Wolverine Hotel Hotel is a four-story Classical Revival brick structure with a flat roof. The lower two floors are rectangular in plan, measuring . The upper two floors are U-shaped. The ground floor is approximately half below grade, with the main floor above about above grade. The walls are constructed of red/orange brick. Small white concrete blocks ornament the third-story windows. A sheet metal cornice runs around the building above the fourth-floor windows, and a parapet wall extends above that. The hotel has three porches with square Doric columns on the north, east, and west elevations. These porches are reproductions of the original porches, which were removed at some time in the past. On the interior, the lobby has Classic Revival pilasters projecting from the walls, and a beamed, coffered ceiling with ornamental plaster moldings. The wood is dark stained oak, and the floor is porcelain tile. This tile extends down the hallway to the main dining room, which has similar pilasters and coffered ceiling. The dining room also has glass chandeliers and a large fireplace. Another bar/dining room is located in the corner of the building, with the kitchen opposite. A frame addition to the building extends the kitchen space to accommodate freezers and coolers.

It discusses her marriage to a Jewish man, referred to as Ben in the article. Herself being a Christian White American of German descent, she describes her marriage as an interracial marriage. The article also discusses the assimilation of Jews and other minorities into a white American mainstream culture. She writes that she frequently tries \\"to see things from the Nazis' point of view,\\" to \\"the hurt confusion\\" of her Jewish husband. The essay became the subject of extensive commentary after The Atlantic published its archive on the Internet in 2008, leading to the article's rediscovery and going viral. The commentary focused on the topics of white privilege and the prejudices in America at the time, and pointed out her na√Øvet√© and the fact that \\"the author, a liberal-minded young woman, manages nonetheless to be spectacularly wrong about just about everything.\\" Jonathan Chait wrote that \\"she tries to take a balanced, blame-both-sides-equally approach to the anti-Semitism issue\\" and called her \\"the world‚Äôs first recorded Shiksplainer,\\" a portmanteau of the disparaging Yiddish term shiksa, meaning a non-Jewish woman or girl, and mansplainer.
