In 1862, he attempted to forge a supply route from California, in defiance of the Union blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports, while also aiming to appropriate the Colorado gold mines to replenish the Confederate treasury. After capturing Albuquerque and Santa Fe, he was forced to retreat after losing the Battle of Glorieta Pass (in today's New Mexico). He was then given minor commands in the southern Louisiana operations, but was accused of serious blunders, apparently caused by drunkenness. Sibley designed a new easy-to-pack 12-man bell tent and stove that were used for many years by the American and British armies. Family and early life Henry Hopkins Sibley's grandfather, Dr. John Sibley, served as a medic in Massachusetts in the American Revolutionary War. His wife was Elizabeth Hopkins, whose family name was given as a middle name to their son Samuel and grandson Henry. After her death in 1803, Dr. Sibley was part of an expedition to the Red River country of western Louisiana for the US government after the Louisiana Purchase and chose to settle in Natchitoches. In 1811, his son Samuel Hopkins Sibley and his wife followed to Natchitoches. Samuel Sibley served as a parish clerk from 1815 until his death in 1823. Henry Hopkins Sibley was born in Natchitoches in 1816. After his father's death when Henry was seven years old, the boy was sent to Missouri to live with his paternal uncle George Champlin Sibley and his wife Mary Easton, the founders of Lindenwood College in St. Charles, Missouri. Union general and first Governor of Minnesota, Henry Hastings Sibley (1811‚Äì1891), was a distant cousin. His family had migrated west in the Northern Tier, which historians have called Greater New England. U.S. Army service At the age of 17, Henry was admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1838 and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He fought Seminole Indians in Florida, 1840‚Äì1841; participated in the Military Occupation of Texas, 1845‚Äì1846; and fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, 1847‚Äì1848. Sibley was on frontier duty in Texas from 1850 to 1855. Sibley was a creative military man. In the 1850s, he invented the \\"Sibley tent\\", which was widely used by the Union Army during the American Civil War and for a short while afterward. The United Kingdom also adopted the design of the Sibley tent. He also invented the Sibley stove (also known as the Sibley tent stove), to heat the tent. The Army used tent stoves of this design into the early years of World War II. From 1855‚Äì1857, Sibley was part of the forces trying to control conflict in Bleeding Kansas, where hundreds of new settlers arrived to vote on the question of slavery, provoked by the 1854 Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. He took part in the Utah War, 1857‚Äì1860, and was in active service in New Mexico 1860‚Äì1861. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Sibley resigned on May 13, 1861, the day of his promotion to major in the 1st Dragoons. Native to Louisiana, he had southern sympathies and joined the Confederate States Army (CSA). Civil War Sibley resigned from the US Army as he sided with the Confederacy. Placed in command of a brigade of volunteer cavalry in West Texas, Sibley dubbed his small force the Army of New Mexico and began planning a New Mexico Campaign to capture the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe and Fort Union on the Santa Fe Trail to establish a forward base of supply. He then intended to continue north to Colorado to capture the numerous gold and silver mines in the area as a means of replenishing the badly depleted Confederate treasury. From there, Sibley planned to join forces with Confederate Lieut. John R. Baylor, already in control of much of southern New Mexico and Arizona territories and headquartered in Tucson, AZ. Their ultimate strategy was to gain access to the warm-water ports of California and establish a badly needed supply line to the South, as the Union Navy had implemented a naval blockade from Virginia to Texas.The Civil War in the Western Territories, Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press 1959 Throughout the 1862 New Mexico campaign, his opponent was Colonel Edward Canby, formerly a comrade in arms in the U.S. Army. Some historians have said he was Sibley's brother in law,Kerby, The Confederate Invasion of New Mexico and Arizona, 1861‚Äì1862, pg. 52 but this relation has been disputed.Taylor (1995) and Whitlock (2006) find no conclusive evidence that they were. Sibley was initially successful at the Battle of Valverde on 20‚Äì21 February and pressed on to capture Albuquerque and Santa Fe in the first weeks of March. Although the subsequent Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28 ended in an apparent Confederate victory on the field, Sibley had to retreat because his supply train was destroyed and most of the horses and mules killed or driven off during the fight. At the same time, Union forces were approaching New Mexico from the west, the California Column. Glorieta Pass has been called the \\"Gettysburg of the West\\" by some authors;Civil War in the American West Sibley's retreat to the campaign's starting point at Fort Bliss in April ended the hopes of the Confederate nation to stretch to the Pacific Ocean and use the mineral wealth of California and possibly Colorado. After the failure of the New Mexico campaign, Sibley was given minor commands under General Richard Taylor about Bayou Teche in south Louisiana, commanding the \\"Arizona Brigade\\" at the battles of Irish Bend and Fort Bisland. The historian John D. Winters reports that he blundered on several occasions, not striking when instructed.John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , pp, 221‚Äì230 Struggling with alcoholism, he was court martialed in Louisiana in 1863. Although not convicted of cowardice, he was censured. Postbellum career and death After the war, Thaddeus P. Mott recruited former Union and CSA soldiers for service in the Egyptian Army. Sibley was one of the first people to arrive in Egypt and served from 1870 to 1873 as a military adviser (with the rank of brigadier general of artillery) to the Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, overseeing the construction of coastal fortifications. However, he fell back into problems with alcohol, and he was dismissed due to illness and disability. Back in the U.S., Sibley lived from 1874 with his daughter in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He wrote articles and worked on military inventions. He fought a legal battle with the U.S. government for outstanding payments on its patents. He died in poverty. He is buried in the Fredericksburg Confederate Cemetery. In popular media * Sibley is referred to several times in the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) directed by Sergio Leone.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, produced by Alberto Grimaldi and directed by Sergio Leone in 1966. It was released as part of The Sergio Leone Anthology by Metro-Goldwyn Mayer in 2003. Sibley is pointed out at about the 42-minute point in the 2003 film. The documentary is on the special features disk accompanying the film. He can be seen riding in the passenger seat on a carriage as the soldiers make their procession through a town. * General Sibley appears as a minor character in Nando Cicero's Red Blood, Yellow Gold (1967), played by an uncredited Carlo Gentili. * He is mentioned in the documentary The Man Who Lost The Civil War (2003), a special feature as part of MGM's release of a Leone DVD anthology in 2003.

He has written nearly 30 books and is the only author to have received the Norwegian Literary Critics' Award three times. His awards include the Mads Wiel Nygaards Endowment in 1969, the Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1989, for Roman 1987 and the Brage Prize in 2006 for Armand V. Solstad is among Norway's top-ranked authors of his generation. His early books were considered somewhat controversial, due to their political emphasis (leaning towards the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist side of the political spectrum). Dag Solstad lives part-time in Berlin and part-time in Oslo. Personal life  Solstad was born in Sandefjord to merchant Ole Modal Solstad and Ragna Sofie Tveitan. His first marriage was to Erna Irene Asp, from 1968. From 1983 to 1990 he was married Tone Elisabeth Melg√•rd. In 1995 he married journalist Therese Bj√∏rneboe, and is thus son-in-law of writer Jens Bj√∏rneboe. Selected works In 16.07.41 (2002), he tells the story in the first-person narrative, of his long and frequent walks through the streets of Berlin. However, the story is at the same time a journey in pursuit of a father-son relationship. T. Singer (1999) is a story about a 34-year-old librarian who leaves Oslo in search of a satisfying and anonymous life in a smaller town. He marries a single mother and at first feels contented in his invisible role as husband and stepfather. However, after two years, Singer files for divorce; she is later killed in a car accident. He returns to Oslo with his stepdaughter where they live together but lead separate lives. Singer broods and becomes very alone yet feels content in the fact that he has chosen an enigmatic lifestyle. This book contains philosophical and existential observations of someone seeking to authenticate their identity through chosen isolation rather than social integration. Medaljens forside (1990) is a book on the history of the industrial construction and engineering company Aker Kv√¶rner, but the author insists it should nevertheless be considered as a novel, with the Aker company as its main character. His 1982 novel Gymnasl√¶rer Pedersens beretning om den store politiske vekkelse som har hjems√∏kt v√•rt land was adapted for the screen in 2006 by Hans Petter Moland as Gymnasl√¶rer Pedersen. Other writings and assessment With fellow novelist Jon Michelet, Solstad has published a book after each of the FIFA World Cups in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998. The books blend analytic reporting with political and cultural commentary, and are contributions to genuine literature. Solstad has also published various essays and articles, both for literary magazines and newspapers, and selections of these have been collected and published in three separate volumes. In her PhD thesis Why So Big? A Literary Discourse Analysis of Dag Solstad's Authorship (University of Oslo, 2009), Inger √òstenstad argues from different perspectives that Solstad is Norway's greatest contemporary writer, and uses a version of Dominique Maingueneau's discourse theory to analyse the components of oeuvre, reception, para-text and meta-text that in Solstad's case contribute to his established greatness. Peter Handke, Karl Ove Knausgaard and Per Petterson, three contemporary writers, regard Solstad highly for his literary excellence.  Novels  * Irr!

Combining playing and broadcasting appearances, Fairly was involved in over 7,000 major league games from 1958 through 2006. Early life and college career Fairly was born in Macon, Georgia, but moved to Southern California when he was three months old, where he grew up. Fairly played varsity baseball for Rod Dedeaux at the University of Southern California (1958), and made the most of it. He hit .348 with team highs of nine home runs and 67 RBI while lettering as a sophomore center fielder on the 1958 Trojan baseball team which won USC's second College World Series championship. There he was a teammate of future baseball executive and General Manager Pat Gillick. An All-District 8 selection that season, he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. After two brief minor league stops, he made the big club late in September 1958. Professional career A competitive player and highly disciplined hitter, Fairly had a short and compact swing with occasional power to all fields. With his glove, he was a competent first baseman as well as at all three outfield positions, being best suited for right field. His talents were overshadowed by a notorious lack of speed. He is one of very few players to play 1000 games or more in both the outfield and the infield. Fairly played 21 seasons of Major League Baseball, 12 of them with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he won three World Series titles. In 2442 career games, Fairly had 1913 hits, a .266 batting average with 215 HR and 1044 RBI, while walking 1052 times compared to only 877 strikeouts. He posted a career .990 fielding percentage. Fairly played in four World Series, appearing in 20 games, hitting .300 with 2 HR and 6 RBI, all with the Los Angeles Dodgers. His career home run total is the most in major league history for a player without a 20-home run season. =Los Angeles Dodgers (1958‚Äì1969)= Fairly made his Major League Baseball debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 9, 1958, going hitless in three at- bats in a 4-3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. The next day, Fairly collected his first career hit, a single off the Phillies Robin Roberts. On September 12, Fairly hit his first career home run off Ron Kline of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Overall with the Dodgers, Fairly played in 15 games, hitting .283 with 2 HR and 8 RBI. In 1959, Fairly was used mostly as a pinch hitter and a defensive replacement late in games, as in 118 games with Los Angeles, he had only 244 at-bats. During the season, he hit .238 with 4 HR and 23 RBI, helping Los Angeles win the National League pennant and advance to the 1959 World Series. Fairly played in all six games during the World Series, going hitless in three at-bats, as the Dodgers won the series over the Chicago White Sox. Fairly spent the majority of the 1960 season with the Dodgers AAA affiliate, the Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League, as he played in only 14 games with Los Angeles, hitting .108 with 1 HR and 3 RBI. In 1961, Fairly played in 111 games with the Dodgers, as he hit .322 with 10 HR and 48 RBI, while spending time between the three outfield positions and first base. Fairly became the Dodgers' everyday first baseman during the 1962 season, as in 147 games, he hit .278 with 14 HR and 71 RBI. Fairly helped the Dodgers clinch the National League pennant in 1963, as he played in 152 games, hitting .271 with 12 HR and 77 RBI. In the 1963 World Series against the New York Yankees, Fairly played in all four games, however, he was credited with only one official at-bat, as he failed to register a hit, but walked three times as Los Angeles won the series. Fairly had another solid season with the Dodgers in 1964, batting .256 with 10 HR and 74 RBI in 150 games. In 1965, Fairly appeared in a career high 158 games with Los Angeles, hitting .274 with 9 HR and 70 RBI, helping the club to their third National League pennant since Fairly joined the team. In the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, Fairly played a key role in the Dodgers' seven game series victory, as he hit .379 with 2 HR and 6 RBI, as Los Angeles won their third World Series title in seven years. Fairly missed a month of the season due to injuries in 1966, playing in only 117 games, his lowest total since 1961, however, he hit .288 with 14 HR and 61 RBI, helping the Dodgers clinch the National League pennant for the second consecutive season. In the 1966 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Fairly hit only .143 with no home runs or RBI in three games, as the Dodgers lost to the Orioles. In 1967, Fairly struggled offensively, as his batting average dipped to .220, while he had 10 HR and 55 RBI in 153 games. Fairly continued his struggles throughout the 1968 season, as he hit only .234 with 4 HR and 43 RBI in 141 with the Dodgers. He began the 1969 season with Los Angeles, however, Fairly continued to struggle with his bat, hitting .219 with 0 HR and 8 RBI in 30 games with the Dodgers. On June 11, Los Angeles traded Fairly and Paul Popovich to the Montreal Expos for Manny Mota and Maury Wills. =Montreal Expos (1969‚Äì1974)= After struggling offensively with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the previous two seasons, Fairly immediately improved with his move to the expansion team Montreal Expos in 1969, where in 70 games with the Expos, Fairly hit .289 with 12 HR and 39 RBI. Fairly had a very solid season in 1970, playing in 119 games with the Expos, hitting .288 with 15 HR and 61 RBI, as well as stealing a career high 10 bases. Fairly saw his batting average fall to .257 in the 1971 season, however, his power numbers remained steady, as he hit 13 HR and 71 RBI in 146 games with Montreal. He continued his solid play with the Expos in 1972, as Fairly hit .278 with 17 HR and 68 RBI in 140 games. Fairly played in his first ever MaJor League All-Star game when he appeared late in the game during the 1973 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a defensive replacement. Overall with the Expos, Fairly hit .276 with 86 HR and 331 RBI in 718 games. During the 1974 season, Fairly lost some playing time, as he appeared in only 101 games with Montreal, hitting .243 with 12 HR and 43 RBI. On December 6, the Expos traded Fairly to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ed Kurpiel and Rudy Kinard. =St. Louis Cardinals (1975‚Äì1976)= Fairly spent the 1975 season as a utility player for the St. Louis Cardinals where in 107 games, he hit .307 with 7 HR and 37 RBI, as he saw his playing time split between first base and as an outfielder. He started the 1976 season with St. Louis, appearing in 73 games, hitting .264 with 0 HR and 21 RBI. On September 14, his contract was purchased by the Oakland Athletics. =Oakland Athletics (1976)= Fairly finished the 1976 season with the Oakland Athletics. In 15 games with Oakland, Fairly hit .239 with 3 HR and 10 RBI, as the Athletics finished in second place in the AL West, ending their division title streak at five. On February 24, 1977, the A's traded Fairly to the Toronto Blue Jays for Gary Weathers and cash. =Toronto Blue Jays (1977)= Fairly split the 1977 season between designated hitter, first base and the outfield, as he played in 132 games with Toronto, hitting .279 with a team leading 19 HR and 64 RBI. He appeared in the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, as a pinch hitter, striking out against Tom Seaver. Fairly is the only player to have represented both Canadian expansion MLB teams in the All-Star game. On December 8, the Blue Jays traded Fairly to the California Angels for Butch Alberts and Pat Kelly. =California Angels (1978)= Fairly finished his career with the California Angels in 1978, playing in 91 games, hitting .217 with 10 HR and 40 RBI. He announced his retirement at the end of the season. Broadcaster After his playing days ended, Fairly began his broadcasting career in 1979 at KTLA in Los Angeles and later joined Bob Starr in the California Angels radio/television booth. During the 1984 season, he also served as the club's hitting instructor for manager John McNamara while continuing to hold down his radio duties. Considered \\"one of the most knowledgeable baseball men in the organization,\\" he suited up prior to each game to instruct hitters during batting practice before returning to the broadcast booth to do Angels games for KMPC radio. Fairly said of the new assignment, \\"When you play as long as I did, you're constantly talking hitting. But I don't see this role in the context of instructing as much as reminding guys what they do well. I get to the park early anyway. And there's no conflict really with my radio work.\\" Then Angels General Manager Buzzie Bavasi told the Orange County Register in announcing the decision, \\"Since we were planning on adding a hitting instructor, the feeling was we had the man right here. Ron is intelligent, articulate and knows the game.\\" In 1987, Fairly moved up the coast and could be heard on KNBR as the voice of the San Francisco Giants. In 1993, he went further north as a broadcaster for the Seattle Mariners, where he stayed through the 2006 season. Fairly served primarily as a color commentator, but occasionally stepped in to do play-by-play as well. In 1997, Fairly was selected to the USC's Athletic Hall of Fame, joining former Trojans Marcus Allen, Buster Crabbe, Charles Dumas, Frank Gifford, Ronnie Lott, Fred Lynn, Tom Seaver and O.J. Simpson, et al. On September 21, 2006, the Mariners announced that Fairly had decided to retire from his post as a team broadcaster after 14 seasons, ending a 27-year career in Major League Baseball broadcasting. Coupled with 21 years as a player, Fairly spent 48 years in and around the Major Leagues. From June 15 to June 17, 2007, Fairly briefly came out of retirement to work as a television analyst for the Mariners during a three-game interleague series against the Houston Astros, in Houston, due to broadcaster Mike Blowers being on vacation. From July 15 to July 18, 2010, Fairly broadcast the Mariners' four-game series against the Los Angeles Angels with Rick Rizzs on KIRO 710 to fill in for Dave Niehaus, who was on vacation. In 2011 and 2012 Fairly returned once more to the Mariners' radio booth, as one of a rotating group of guest announcers filling in on their broadcasts following the death of Dave Niehaus after the 2010 season. Later life and death Fairly died of pancreatic cancer on October 30, 2019, aged 81.

Its common name is derived from the Chinookan peoples. Other vernacular names for the species include king salmon, Quinnat salmon, spring salmon, chrome hog, and Tyee salmon. The scientific species name is based on the Russian common name chavycha (—á–∞–≤—ã—á–∞). Chinook are anadromous fish native to the North Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from California to Alaska, as well as Asian rivers ranging from northern Japan to the Palyavaam River in the Arctic northeast Siberia. They have been introduced to other parts of the world, including New Zealand, thriving in Lake Michigan Great Lakes of North America and Michigan's western rivers, and Patagonia. A large Chinook is a prized and sought-after catch for a sporting angler. The flesh of the salmon is also highly valued for its dietary nutritional content, which includes high levels of important omega-3 fatty acids. Some populations are endangered; however, many are healthy. The Chinook salmon has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List. According to NOAA the Chinook salmon population along the California coast is declining, from factors such as overfishing, loss of freshwater and estuarine habitat, hydropower development, poor ocean conditions, and hatchery practices. Distribution A male Chinook in its spawning phase =Natural range= Historically, the native distribution of Chinook salmon in North America ranged from the Ventura River in California in the south to Kotzebue Sound in Alaska in the north. Populations have disappeared from large areas where they once flourished, however, shrinking by as much as 40 percent. In some regions, their inland range has been cut off, mainly by dams and habitat alterations: from Southern California, some areas east of the Coast Ranges of California and Oregon, and large areas in the Snake River and upper Columbia River drainage basins. In certain areas like California's Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta, it was revealed that extremely low populations of juvenile Chinook salmon (less than 1%) were surviving. In the western Pacific, the distribution ranges from northern Japan (Hokkaido) in the south to the Arctic Ocean as far as the East Siberian Sea and Palyavaam River in the north. Nevertheless, they are consistently present and the distribution is well known only in Kamchatka. Elsewhere, information is scarce, but they have a patchy presence in the Anadyr River basin and parts of the Chukchi Peninsula. Also in parts of the northern Magadan Oblast near the Shelikhov Gulf and Penzhina Bay stocks might persist, but remain poorly studied. =Introduced populations= In 1967, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources planted Chinook in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to control the alewife, an invasive species of nuisance fish from the Atlantic Ocean. In the 1960s, alewives constituted 90% of the biota in these lakes. Coho salmon had been introduced the year before, and the program was a success. Chinook and Coho salmon thrived on the alewives and spawned in the lakes' tributaries. After this success, Chinook were planted in the other Great Lakes,Spring, Barbara. The Dynamic Great Lakes,(p. 48) , Independence Books, 2001 where sport fishermen prize them for their aggressive behaviour on the hook. The species has also established itself in Patagonian waters in South America, where both introduced and escaped hatchery fish have colonized rivers and established stable spawning runs. Chinook salmon have been found spawning in headwater reaches of the Rio Santa Cruz, apparently having migrated over from the ocean. The population is thought to be derived from a single stocking of juveniles in the lower river around 1930. Sporadic efforts to introduce the fish to New Zealand waters in the late 19th century were largely failures and led to no evident establishments. Early ova were imported from the Baird hatchery of the McCloud River in California.McDowell, R.M. (1994) Gamekeepers for the Nation. Chapter 18. Canterbury University Press: Christchurch. Further efforts in the early 20th century were more successful and subsequently led to the establishment of spawning runs in the rivers of Canterbury and North Otago; Rangitata River, the Opihi River, the Ashburton River, the Rakaia River, the Waimakariri River, the Hurunui River, and the Waiau River.McDowall, R. M. (1994). The origins of New Zealand's chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Marine Fisheries Review, 1/1/1994. The success of the latter introductions is thought to be partly attributable to the use of ova from autumn-run populations as opposed to ova from spring-run populations used in the first attempts. Whilst other salmon have also been introduced into New Zealand, only Chinook salmon (or King salmon as it is known locally in New Zealand) have established sizeable pelagic runs. Description A pair of chinook caught in the ocean Chinook salmon tail, showing distinctive combination of black spots and silver The Chinook is blue- green, red, or purple on the back and top of the head, with silvery sides and white ventral surfaces. It has black spots on its tail and the upper half of its body. Although spots are seen on the tail in pink salmon, and silver on the tail in silver and dog salmon, Chinook are unique among the Pacific salmon in combining black spots and silver on the tail. Another distinctive feature is a black gum line that is present in both salt and freshwater. Adult fish range in size from , but may be up to in length; they average , but may reach . The meat can be either pink or white in color, depending on what the salmon have been feeding on. Chinook salmon are the largest of the Pacific salmon. In the Kenai River of Alaska, mature Chinook averaged .Burger, C. V., Wilmot, R. L., & Wangaard, D. B. (1985).

The current sport-caught world record, , was caught on May 17, 1985, in the Kenai River. The commercial catch world record is caught near Rivers Inlet, British Columbia, in the late 1970s.Scott and Crossman. 1985. Freshwater Fishes of Canada. Fisheries Research Board of Canada. page 175. Life cycle Fertilized Chinook eggs Chinook may spend one to eight years in the ocean (averaging from three to four years) before returning to their home rivers to spawn. The salmon undergo radical morphological changes as they prepare for the spawning event ahead. Salmon lose the silvery blue they had as ocean fish, and their color darkens, sometimes with a radical change in hue. Salmon are sexually dimorphic, and the male salmon develop canine-like teeth and their jaws develop a pronounced curve or hook, called a \\"kype\\". Studies have shown that larger and more dominant male salmon have a reproductive advantage as female Chinook are often more aggressive toward smaller males. Chinook spawn in larger and deeper waters than other salmon species and can be found on the spawning redds (nests) from September to December. The female salmon may lay her eggs in four to five nesting pockets within a redd. After laying eggs, females guard the redd from four to 25 days before dying, while males seek additional mates. Chinook eggs hatch 90 to 150 days after deposition, depending upon water temperature. Egg deposits are timed to ensure the young salmon fry emerge during an appropriate season for survival and growth. Fry and parr (young fish) usually stay in fresh water 12 to 18 months before traveling downstream to estuaries, where they remain as smolts for several months. Some Chinooks return to the fresh water one or two years earlier than their counterparts and are referred to as \\"jack\\" salmon. \\"Jack\\" salmon are typically less than long but are sexually mature. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon, over from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse, Yukon.https://www.yukonriverpanel.com/about-us/yukon-river-panel/yukon-river- salmon/chinook/ Since Chinook rely on fat reserves for energy upon entering fresh water, commercial fish caught here are highly prized for their unusually high levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. However, the high cost of harvest and transport from this rural area limits its affordability. The highest in elevation Chinook migrate to spawn is in the Upper Salmon River and Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. These fish travel over in elevation, and over , in their migration through eight dams and reservoirs on the Columbia and Lower Snake Rivers. Chinook eat insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young, and primarily other fish when older. Young salmon feed in streambeds for a short period until they are strong enough to journey out into the ocean and acquire more food. Chinook juveniles divide into two types: ocean-type and stream-type. Ocean-type Chinook migrate to salt water in their first year. Stream-type salmon spend one full year in fresh water before migrating to the ocean. After a few years in the ocean, adult salmon, then large enough to escape most predators, return to their original streambeds to mate. Chinook can have extended lifespans, where some fish spend one to five years in the ocean, reaching age eight. More northerly populations tend to have longer lives. School of Chinook Salmon need adequate spawning habitat. Clean, cool, oxygenated, sediment-free fresh water is essential for egg development. Chinook use larger sediment (gravel) sizes for spawning than other Pacific salmon. Riparian vegetation and woody debris help juvenile salmon by providing cover and maintaining low water temperatures. Chinook also need healthy ocean habitats. Juvenile salmon grow in clean, productive estuarine environments and gain the energy for migration. Later, they change physiologically to live in salt water. They rely on eelgrass and seaweeds for camouflage (protection from predators), shelter, and foraging habitat as they make their way to the open ocean. Adult fish need a rich, open ocean habitat to acquire the strength needed to travel back upstream, escape predators, and reproduce before dying. In his book King of Fish, David Montgomery writes, \\"The reserves of fish at sea are important to restocking rivers disturbed by natural catastrophes.\\" Thus, it is vitally important for the fish to be able to reach the oceans (without man-made obstructions such as dams), so they can grow into healthy adult fish to sustain the species. The bodies of water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high productivity and growth rate in the oceans is the level of algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat.Klinger, Terrie. Lecture. 15 April 2005. What Defines the Pacific Northwest Marine Realm Ecologically and Geographically? University of Washington; Seattle, WA. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents to not be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain. Chinook salmon moving upstream With some populations endangered, precautions are necessary to prevent overfishing and habitat destruction, including appropriate management of hydroelectric and irrigation projects. If too few fish remain because of fishing and land management practices, salmon have more difficulty reproducing. When one of these factors is compromised, affected stock can decline. One Seattle Times article states, \\"Pacific salmon have disappeared from 40 percent of their historic range outside Alaska,\\" and concludes it is imperative for people to realize the needs of salmon and to try not to contribute to destructive practices that harm salmon runs. In the Pacific Northwest, the summer runs of especially large Chinook once common (before dams and overfishing led to declines) were known as June hogs. A Chinook's birthplace and later evolution can be tracked by looking at its otolith (ear) bone. The bone can record the chemical composition of the water the fish had lived in just like a tree's growth rings provide hints on dry and wet years. The bone is built with the chemical signature of the environment that hosted the fish. Researchers were able to tell where different individuals of Chinook were born and lived in the first year of their lives. Testing was done by measuring the strontium in the bones. Strontium can accurately show researchers the exact location and time of a fish swimming in a river. Fishing industry alt= =Wild capture= The total North Pacific fisheries harvest of the Chinook salmon in 2010 was some 1.4 million fish, corresponding to 7,000 tonnes; 1.1 million of the fish were captured in the United States, others were divided by Canada and Russia. The share of Chinook salmon from the total commercial Pacific salmon harvest was less than 1% by weight, and only some 0.3% of the number of fish. Annual Statistics 2010: Commercial salmon catch by species and country North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission Statistical Yearbook. Retrieved 2015 March 16. The statistics do not include fish taken in Russian waters by non-Russian fleet. The trend has been down in the captures from the pre-1990 times, when the total harvest was around 25,000 tonnes. Global production has, however, remained at a stable level because of increased aquaculture. =Aquaculture= The world's largest producer and market supplier of the Chinook salmon is New Zealand. Marketed as King salmon, in 2009, New Zealand exported 5,088 tonnes of salmon equating to a value of NZ$61 million in export earnings. For the year ended March 2011, this amount had increased to NZ$85 million. New Zealand accounts for about half of the global production of Chinook salmon, and about half of New Zealand's production is exported. Japan is New Zealand's largest export market, with stock also being supplied to other countries of the Pacific Rim, including Australia. Farming of the species in New Zealand began in the 1970s, when hatcheries were initially set up to enhance and support wild fish stocks with the first commercial operations initiating in 1976. After some opposition against their establishment by societal groups, including anglers, the first sea cage farm was established in 1983 at Big Glory Bay in Stewart Island by British Petroleum NZ Ltd. Today, the salmon are hatched in land-based hatcheries (several of which exist) and transferred to sea cages or freshwater farms, where they are grown out to harvestable size of . The broodstock for the farms is usually selected from existing farm stock or sometimes sourced from wild populations. Eggs and milt are stripped manually from sexually mature salmon and incubated under conditions replicating the streams and rivers where the salmon would spawn naturally (around ). After hatching, the baby salmon are typically grown to smolt stage (around six- months of age) before they are transferred to the sea cages or ponds. Most sea cage farming occurs in the Marlborough Sounds, Stewart Island, and Akaroa Harbour, while freshwater operations in Canterbury, Otago, and Tasman use ponds, raceways, and hydrocanals for growout operations. Low stocking densities, ranging between less than 1 kg/m3 and around 25 kg/m3 (depending on the life stage of the salmon) and the absence of disease in the fish means New Zealand farmers do not need to use antibiotics or vaccines to maintain the health of their salmon stocks. The salmon are fed food pellets of fish meal specially formulated for Chinook salmon (typical proportions of the feed are: 45% protein, 22% fat, and 14% carbohydrate plus ash and water) and contain no steroids or other growth enhancers. Regulations and monitoring programmes ensure salmon are farmed in a sustainable manner. The planning and approval process for new salmon farms in New Zealand considers the farm's potential environmental effects, its effects on fishing activities (if it is a marine farm), and any possible cultural and social effects. In the interest of fish welfare, a number of New Zealand salmon farming operations anaesthetise salmon before slaughter using Aqui-S‚Ñ¢, an organically based anaesthetic developed in New Zealand that is safe for use in food and that has been favourably reported on by the British Humane Slaughter Association. In recognition of the sustainable, environmentally conscious practices, the New Zealand salmon farming industry has been acknowledged as the world's greenest by the Global Aquaculture Performance Index. Chile is the only country other than New Zealand currently producing significant quantities of farmed Chinook salmon. The United States has not produced farmed Chinook in commercial quantities since 1994. In Canada, most commercial salmon production ceased by 2009. =Management= Nine populations of Chinook salmon are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as either threatened or endangered. The Snake River fall-run population is being considered for delisting.NMFS. Listing Endangered or Threatened Species; 90-Day Finding on a Petition To Delist the Snake River Fall-Run Chinook Salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit.Federal Register;; v80, (April 22, 2015), 22468-22472. Fisheries in the U.S. and Canada are limited by impacts to weak and endangered salmon runs. The fall and late-fall runs in the Central Valley population in California is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Species of Concern. In April 2008, commercial fisheries in both Oregon and California were closed because of the low population of Chinook salmon present. The low population is being blamed on the collapse of the Sacramento River run, one of the biggest south of the Columbia.Blankship, Donna. Salmon Fishing Banned Along U.S. West Coast. National Geographic. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080411-AP-disappearin_2.html. April, 2008. In April 2009 California again canceled the season. The Pacific Fishery Management Council's goal for the Sacramento River run is an escapement total (fish that return to freshwater spawn areas and hatcheries) of 122,000‚Äì180,000 fish. The 2007 escapement was estimated at 88,000, and the 2008 estimate was 66,000 fish. Scientists from universities and federal, state, and tribal agencies concluded the 2004 and 2005 broods were harmed by poor ocean conditions in 2005 and 2006, in addition to \\"a long-term, steady degradation of the freshwater and estuarine environment.\\" Such conditions included weak upwelling, warm sea surface temperatures, and low densities of food. In Oregon, the 2010 spring Chinook run was forecast to increase by up to 150% over 2009 populations, growing from 200,000 to over 500,000, making this the largest run in recorded history. Lower temperatures in 2008 North Pacific waters brought in fatter plankton, which, along with greater outflows of Columbia River water, fed the resurgent populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife estimated 80% of them were hatchery-born. Chinook runs in other habitats have not recovered proportionately. In April 2016 Coleman National Fish Hatchery outside of Red Bluff, California, released 12 million baby Chinook salmon, with many salmon being tagged in order to be monitored. The release was done in hopes to help restore the salmon population of Battle Creek.http://www.casalmon.org/salmon-snapshots/population/battle-creek Salmon Snapshots / Battle Creek / 2014 Population  Lake Michigan  Chinook salmon in Lake Michigan are sought after by tourists enjoying chartered fishing trips.It‚Äôs No Fish Tale‚Ä¶ Charter Boat Captain Is Living His Dream by Joel Waldinger, November 5, 2015, Wisconsin Life, PBS A 2016 survey of Wisconsin anglers found they would on average pay $140 for a trip to catch Chinook salmon, $90 for lake trout, and $180 for walleye.Wisconsin Sea Grant documents value of recreational fishing in Lake Michigan by Aaron R. Conklin, Wisconsin Sea Grant, July 10, 2017 Should the Chinook salmon fishery collapse and be replaced with a native lake trout fishery, the economic value would decrease by 80%.Can Native Species Compete with Valuable Exotics? Measuring Willingness to Pay for Recreational Fishing in Lake Michigan by Raynor, Jennifer and Phaneuf, Daniel, Presentation for the 2018 International Institute of Fisheries Economics & Trade Cultural aspects Native American men with large salmon The Chinook salmon is spiritually and culturally prized among certain First Nations peoples. Many celebrate the first spring Chinook caught each year with \\"first-salmon ceremonies\\". While salmon fishing is still important economically for many tribal communities, the Chinook harvest is typically the most valuable. Chinook salmon were described and enthusiastically eaten by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Lewis wrote that, when fresh, they tasted better than any other fish he had ever eaten. They did not particularly like dried or \\"pounded\\" salmon. Lewis and Clark knew about Pacific salmon but had never seen one. The Western world had known about Pacific salmon since the late 18th century. Maritime fur traders and explorers, such as George Vancouver, frequently acquired salmon by trade with the indigenous people of the Northwest coast. Lewis and Clark first encountered Chinook salmon as a gift from Chief Cameahwait, on August 13, 1805, near Lemhi Pass. Tasting it convinced Lewis they had crossed the continental divide. Known as the \\"king salmon\\" in Alaska for its large size and flavorful flesh, the Chinook is the state fish of this state and of Oregon.

A hydrolyzing reaction that breaks phosphodiester bonds at either the 3‚Ä≤ or the 5‚Ä≤ end occurs. Its close relative is the endonuclease, which cleaves phosphodiester bonds in the middle (endo) of a polynucleotide chain. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes have three types of exonucleases involved in the normal turnover of mRNA: 5‚Ä≤ to 3‚Ä≤ exonuclease (Xrn1), which is a dependent decapping protein; 3‚Ä≤ to 5‚Ä≤ exonuclease, an independent protein; and poly(A)-specific 3‚Ä≤ to 5‚Ä≤ exonuclease. In both archaea and eukaryotes, one of the main routes of RNA degradation is performed by the multi-protein exosome complex, which consists largely of 3‚Ä≤ to 5‚Ä≤ exoribonucleases. Significance to polymerase RNA polymerase II is known to be in effect during transcriptional termination; it works with a 5' exonuclease (human gene Xrn2) to degrade the newly formed transcript downstream, leaving the polyadenylation site and simultaneously shooting the polymerase. This process involves the exonuclease's catching up to the pol II and terminating the transcription. Pol I then synthesizes DNA nucleotides in place of the RNA primer it had just removed. DNA polymerase I also has 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' exonuclease activity, which is used in editing and proofreading DNA for errors. The 3' to 5' can only remove one mononucleotide at a time, and the 5' to 3' activity can remove mononucleotides or up to 10 nucleotides at a time. E. coli types WRN Exonuclease with active sites in yellow In 1971, Lehman IR discovered exonuclease I in E. coli. Since that time, there have been numerous discoveries including: exonuclease, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII. Each type of exonuclease has a specific type of function or requirement. Exonuclease I breaks apart single-stranded DNA in a 3' ‚Üí 5' direction, releasing deoxyribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates one after another. It does not cleave DNA strands without terminal 3'-OH groups because they are blocked by phosphoryl or acetyl groups. Exonuclease II is associated with DNA polymerase I, which contains a 5' exonuclease that clips off the RNA primer contained immediately upstream from the site of DNA synthesis in a 5' ‚Üí 3' manner. Exonuclease III has four catalytic activities: * 3' to 5' exodeoxyribonuclease activity, which is specific for double-stranded DNA * RNase activity * 3' phosphatase activity * AP endonuclease activity (later found to be called endonuclease II). Exonuclease IV adds a water molecule, so it can break the bond of an oligonucleotide to nucleoside 5' monophosphate. This exonuclease requires Mg 2+ in order to function and works at higher temperatures than exonuclease I. Exonuclease V is a 3' to 5' hydrolyzing enzyme that catalyzes linear double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, which requires Ca2+. This enzyme is extremely important in the process of homologous recombination. Exonuclease VIII is 5' to 3' dimeric protein that does not require ATP or any gaps or nicks in the strand, but requires a free 5' OH group to carry out its function. Discoveries in humans The 3' to 5' human type endonuclease is known to be essential for the proper processing of histone pre-mRNA, in which U7 snRNP directs the single cleavage process. Following the removal of the downstream cleavage product (DCP) Xrn1 continues to further breakdown the product until it is completely degraded. This allows the nucleotides to be recycled. Xrn1 is linked to a co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC) activity that acts as a precursor to develop a free 5' unprotected end, so the exonuclease can remove and degrade the downstream cleavage product (DCP). This initiates transcriptional termination because one does not want DNA or RNA strands building up in their bodies. Discoveries in yeast CCR4-Not is a general transcription regulatory complex in budding yeast that is found to be associated with mRNA metabolism, transcription initiation, and mRNA degradation. CCR4 has been found to contain RNA and single-stranded DNA 3' to 5' exonuclease activities. Another component associated with the CCR4-Not is CAF1 protein, which has been found to contain 3' to 5' or 5' to 3' exonuclease domains in the mouse and Caenorhabditis elegans. This protein has not been found in yeast, which suggests that it is likely to have an abnormal exonuclease domain like the one seen in a metazoan. Yeast contains Rat1 and Xrn1 exonuclease. The Rat1 works just like the human type (Xrn2) and Xrn1 function in the cytoplasm is in the 5' to 3' direction to degrade RNAs (pre-5.8s and 25s rRNAs) in the absence of Rat1.

Orphaned at 11, Castle dropped out of high school at 15 to work in the theater. He came to the attention of Columbia Pictures for his talent for promotion and was hired. He learned the trade of filmmaking and became a director, acquiring a reputation for the ability to churn out competent B-movies quickly and on budget. He eventually struck out on his own, producing and directing thrillers, which, despite their low budgets, he effectively promoted using gimmicks, a trademark for which he is best known. He was also the producer for Rosemary's Baby. Personal life Castle was born William Schloss Jr. in New York City, the son of Saidie (Snellenberg) and William Schloss. His family was Jewish. (\\"Schloss\\" is German for \\"castle\\", and Castle later translated his surname into English as his pseudonym.) His mother died when he was nine. When his father followed a year later, he was left an orphan at the age of 11. He then lived with his older sister. Castle married Ellen Falck, with whom he had two children. Career =Getting started= At 13, he went to see the play Dracula, starring Bela Lugosi, and was entranced. He watched performance after performance, eventually managing to meet Lugosi himself. He wrote in his autobiography Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America: \\"I knew then what I wanted to do with my life--I wanted to scare the pants off audiences.\\" Lugosi recommended him for the position of assistant stage manager for the road company tour of the play. The 15-year-old dropped out of high school to take the job. He spent his teenage years working on Broadway in jobs ranging from set building to acting. This proved good training for the future filmmaker. He obtained Orson Welles' telephone number and persuaded Welles to lease him the Stony Creek Theatre in Connecticut. (Welles was leaving to begin filming Citizen Kane.) He hired German actress Ellen Schwanneke; upon learning that, under then-current theater guild regulations, German-born actors could only appear in plays originally performed in Germany, Castle claimed he had hired her for the nonexistent play Das ist nicht f√ºr Kinder (Not for Children); Castle spent the following weekend writing the play and having it translated into German. When Nazi Germany sent Schwanneke an invitation to a Munich performance, Castle seized the opportunity for an outrageous publicity stunt. He released to the newspapers what he claimed was a telegram he had sent turning down the request, portraying his star as \\"the girl who said no to Hitler.\\" To add to the sensationalism, he secretly vandalized the theatre and painted swastikas on the exterior. It worked. The resulting publicity ensured the success of the play (which he had written in 48 hours). =Columbia Pictures and other studios= William Castle, director at Columbia Pictures (1946) He left for Hollywood at 23 to work for Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Beginning as a dialogue director for Music in My Heart (1940), he and several others such as Fred Sears, Mel Ferrer, Henry Levin and Robert Gordon were selected to be feature film directors. In the 2007 documentary Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story, his daughter states he had a dynamic, outgoing personality that attracted others. He was one of the few people Cohn liked. He learned the film business and graduated to directing inexpensive B-movies, the first being The Chance of a Lifetime, released in 1943. He directed four movies in The Whistler series. Castle gained a reputation for being able to make films under budget and quickly. In addition, he worked as an associate producer on Orson Welles' film noir The Lady from Shanghai (1947), doing much second unit location work. =On his own: the gimmicks= Ambitions unsatisfied, Castle began to make films independently. The inspiration of the 1955 French psychological thriller Les Diaboliques set the genre he would choose. He financed his first movie, Macabre (1958), by mortgaging his house. He came up with the idea to give every customer a certificate for a $1,000 life insurance policy from Lloyd's of London in case they should die of fright during the film. He stationed nurses in the lobbies with hearses parked outside the theaters. Macabre was a hit. Other films (and gimmicks) followed: *House on Haunted Hill (1959), filmed in \\"Emergo\\". A skeleton with red lighted eye sockets attached to wire floated over the audience in the final moments of some showings of the film to parallel the action on screen when a skeleton rises from a vat of acid and pursues the villainous wife of Vincent Price's character. Once word spread about the skeleton, kids enjoyed trying to knock it down with candy boxes, soda cups, or any other objects at hand. The Tingler, 1959: \\"Can You Take Percepto?\\" * The Tingler (1959), filmed in \\"Percepto\\". The title character is a creature that attaches itself to the human spinal cord. It is activated by fright and can only be destroyed by screaming. Castle purchased military surplus airplane wing de-icers (consisting of vibrating motors) and had a crew travel from theatre to theatre, attaching them to the underside of some of the seats (in that era, a movie did not necessarily open on the same night nationwide). In the finale, one of the creatures supposedly gets loose in the movie theater itself. The buzzers were activated as the film's star, Vincent Price, warned the audience to \\"scream--scream for your lives!\\" Some sources incorrectly state the seats were wired to give electrical jolts. Filmmaker and Castle fan John Waters recounted in Spine Tingler! how, as a youngster, he would search for a seat that had been wired in order to enjoy the full effect. *13 Ghosts (1960), filmed in \\"Illusion-O.\\" Each patron received a handheld ghost viewer/remover. During certain segments of the film, a person could see the ghosts by looking through the red cellophane or hide them by looking through the blue. Without the viewer, the ghosts were somewhat visible. The DVD release included red/blue glasses (not 3D glasses, as sometimes reported) to replicate the effect. *Homicidal (1961). There was a \\"fright break\\" with a timer overlaid on the film's climax, as the heroine approaches a house harboring a sadistic killer. The audience had 45 seconds to leave and get a full refund if they were too frightened to see the remainder of the film. In an early showing, wily patrons simply sat through the movie a second time and left at the break to get their money back; to prevent this in future, Castle had different color tickets printed for each showing. About 1% of patrons still demanded refunds. John Waters described Castle's response: > William Castle simply went nuts. He came up with \\"Coward's Corner,\\" a yellow > cardboard booth, manned by a bewildered theater employee in the lobby. When > the Fright Break was announced, and you found that you couldn't take it > anymore, you had to leave your seat and, in front of the entire audience, > follow yellow footsteps up the aisle, bathed in a yellow light. Before you > reached Coward's Corner, you crossed yellow lines with the stenciled > message: \\"Cowards Keep Walking.\\" You passed a nurse (in a yellow > uniform?...I wonder), who would offer a blood-pressure test. All the while a > recording was blaring, \\"Watch the chicken! Watch him shiver in Coward's > Corner!\\" As the audience howled, you had to go through one final indignity ‚Äì > at Coward's Corner you were forced to sign a yellow card stating, \\"I am a > bona fide coward.\\" :In a trailer for the film, Castle explained the use of the Coward's Certificate and admonished the viewer not to reveal the ending to friends \\"or they will kill you. If they don't, I will.\\" * Mr. Sardonicus (1961). The audience could vote on the villain's fate in a \\"punishment poll\\" during the climax--Castle appeared on screen to explain two options. Each member of the audience was given a card with a glow-in-the-dark thumb they could hold up or down to decide if Mr. Sardonicus should be cured or die. Supposedly no audience ever chose mercy, so the alternate ending was never screened. Though Castle claimed in his autobiography that the merciful version was shot and shown occasionally, many suspect otherwise. In the drive-in version, drivers were asked to flash their car headlights to choose. * Zotz! (1962). Each patron was given a \\"magic\\" (gold colored, plastic, glow-in-the-dark) coin. * 13 Frightened Girls (1963). Castle launched a publicized worldwide casting hunt for the prettiest girls from different countries (not 13 as in the title, but 15). He filmed slightly different versions, highlighting each girl for the release in her country. * Strait-Jacket (1964). Advised by his financial backers to eliminate gimmicks, Castle hired Joan Crawford to star and sent her on a promotional tour to select theatres. At the last minute, Castle had cardboard axes printed that were handed out to patrons. *I Saw What You Did (1965). Another Joan Crawford vehicle, this film was initially promoted using giant plastic telephones, but after a rash of prank phone calls and complaints, the Bell Telephone Company monopoly refused Castle permission to use them or mention telephones. So he turned the back rows of theatres into \\"Shock Sections.\\" Seat belts were installed to keep patrons from being jolted from their chairs in fright. *Bug (1975). Castle advertised a million-dollar life insurance policy for the film's star, \\"Hercules\\" the cockroach. At the height of his popularity, Castle had a fan club with 250,000 members. =Rosemary's Baby= According to Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story, he mortgaged his home (again) and obtained the movie rights to the Ira Levin novel before it was published, hoping to finally direct a prestigious A-movie himself. He made a deal with Paramount Pictures, then under Robert Evans who insisted on hiring director Roman Polanski. Castle had to settle for producing the film. He had a cameo, playing the grey-haired man standing outside the phone booth where Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, is attempting to get in touch with the obstetrician. Castle was unable to build on the film's success. He suffered kidney failure soon after its release. By the time he recovered, all momentum was lost, and he went back to making B-movies. His most significant acting role was also his last--as the director of the doomed \\"Waterloo\\" epic in The Day of the Locust in 1975. Death Castle died on May 31, 1977, in Los Angeles, California, of a heart attack. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Legacy Alfred Hitchcock decided to make Psycho after noting the financial success of 1950s B-movies by Castle and Roger Corman. Among his admirers is filmmaker John Waters, who wrote, \\"William Castle was my idol. His films made me want to make films... William Castle was God.\\" Waters portrayed Castle in the episode \\"Hagsploitation\\" in the first season of the FX television anthology series Feud, depicting the notorious rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford through the production and aftermath of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Waters (playing Castle) appears onstage at an Oklahoma theater in 1964, exuberantly introducing a screening of Strait-Jacket while Jessica Lange (as Crawford) proceeds down the aisle, wincing and wielding an axe past hooting teenagers before pursuing Castle behind a backlit scrim to \\"decapitate\\" him in silhouette. He is Robert Zemeckis's \\"favorite filmmaker.\\" Zemeckis co-founded Dark Castle Entertainment, which was intended to remake Castle's films. Two of his films were remade by his daughter Terry Ann Castle, who co-produced House on Haunted Hill in 1999 and Thirteen Ghosts in 2001 (the latter retitled Thir13en Ghosts). A documentary focusing on Castle's life, Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story, directed by Jeffrey Schwarz, premiered at AFI Fest 2007 in Los Angeles on November 8, 2007. It won the Audience Award for Best Documentary. The protagonist in the 1993 film Matinee, played by John Goodman, is based on Castle.

It was the southernmost of the forts defending Savannah and was involved in the most battles. It was located on the Ogeechee River in Bryan County. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (#70000197). Fort McAllister was one of three forts protecting Savannah, the others being Fort Pulaski and Fort James Jackson standing in Confederate defiance of the Union naval blockade. The southeast coast of the United States was the place where both combatants tested the latest in naval artillery and coastal defenses.Durham, p. 102 Fort McAllister was the key to unlocking the defenses around Savannah, one of the most important Confederate ports on the Atlantic Ocean. History After the siege of the fort The fort was designed by Capt. John McCrady. In 1861 Gen. Robert E. Lee inspected the fort and recommended making it stronger. McCrady made the changes recommended by Lee and the earthen walls were better able to withstand bombardment from artillery fire. The fort had seven cannon emplacements. The bombproof area in the center housed a hospital, supply area, barracks, officer's quarters, gun power, and additional guns. A 10-inch mortar was kept outside the fort to keep it from shaking the dirt off the walls when it was fired. The fort was attacked seven times by ships over the next two years. The fort withstood all of these attacks with only minimal damage and few casualties. There were four naval attacks in 1862. Union ironclad monitors began to attack the fort on January 27, 1863, starting with the Montauk and later with the Passaic, Nahant, and Patapsco. The Montauk had an 11-inch and a 15-inch cannon, the largest size used in the war. The ironclad bombarded the fort for 5 hours but caused no casualties and little damage because the earth absorbed the artillery shells and the damage was easily repaired. Similarly, the fort's cannons hit the ironclad 15 times but caused no significant damage. The Montauk made another unsuccessful attack on February 1, except that fort commander Maj. John B. Gallie was killed. A 7-hour bombardment on March 3 also failed to damage the fort. The fort was the site of the sinking of the CSS Nashville on February 28, 1863. On December 13, 1864, Gen. William T. Sherman reached the fort on his March to the Sea. Gen. William B. Hazen's infantry division attacked the fort, defended by Maj. George Wayne Anderson and some 230 troops. The Union force overpowered the fort's defenders in about 15 minutes of battle. Fort McAllister was the last fort defending Savannah. After it fell, Gen. William J. Hardee withdrew his 10,000 troops that were defending Savannah and Sherman captured the city without resistance. Sherman's army abandoned the fort and burned its bunkers. During the evening that the fort fell, Anderson was being held at the McAllister family home, the new headquarters of General William Babcock Hazen. General Hazen and Lt. Col. Strong invited General Sherman to dinner, to celebrate their victory. In a kind gesture of respect, General Hazen also invited Major Anderson to attend the meal, after clearing the request with Sherman. The discussion was surely lively - during the meal Anderson engaged in a heated exchange with General Sherman about the tactics employed to defend the fortDurham, p. 169 and the bravery of all who fought there. Cigars were exchanged and smoked, and tributes were made to the fallen. However, Sherman remained greatly upset at Anderson's use of land mines in the defense of the fort, and ordered the Major to personally join his fellow captured Confederates on mine-clearing detail. After the war In the late 1930s, Henry Ford bought the property and began restoring it. The International Paper Company purchased the property from Ford's estate and gave it to the State of Georgia in 1958. The Georgia Historical Commission continued to restore the fort to its 1863-64 appearance. The museum displays many artifacts. The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The fort site was combined with the adjacent Richmond Hill State Park to create the Fort McAllister State Historic Park.

Dare is the producer or devisor of various (mainly comedy) programmes mainly for BBC Radio and television, including The Mary Whitehouse Experience, Dead Ringers, The Now Show, The Late Edition, I've Never Seen Star Wars and The Secret World, and Brian Gulliver's Travels. He was also the producer of eight series of ITV's Spitting Image. A running gag on the radio version of Dead Ringers was Jon Culshaw, in the style of Tom Baker saying Dare's name in an exaggerated fashion at the end of the credits. He wrote and appeared in his own Radio 4 sketch show, Life, Death and Sex with Mike and Sue which ran for five series. More recently he has emerged as a more serious writer. Dare's first novel, Natural Selection is published in the UK and US, and his first stage play, Touch, was performed at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2007. His second play, \\"Misconception\\" was also performed at Edinburgh. His radio series, Brian Gulliver's Travels is now a novel, published by Pilrig Press 2013. Ian Hislop wrote \\"A modern tale that keeps the flavour of the original classic, cleverly managing to provoke both laughter and thought\\".

He has written nine novels, two of which, number9dream (2001) and Cloud Atlas (2004), were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. He has also written articles for several newspapers, most notably for The Guardian, and translated several books about autism from Japanese to English. Following the release of the 2012 film adaptation of Cloud Atlas, Mitchell started working as a screenwriter alongside Lana Wachowski, one of Cloud Atlas three directors; together with Aleksandar Hemon, they wrote the series finale of the television series Sense8 and the upcoming film The Matrix 4. Early life Mitchell was born in Southport in Lancashire (now Merseyside), England, and raised in Malvern, Worcestershire. He was educated at Hanley Castle High School and at the University of Kent, where he obtained a degree in English and American Literature followed by an M.A. in Comparative Literature. Mitchell lived in Sicily for a year, then moved to Hiroshima, Japan, where he taught English to technical students for eight years, before returning to England, where he could live on his earnings as a writer and support his pregnant wife. Work Mitchell's first novel, Ghostwritten (1999), moves around the globe, from Okinawa to Mongolia to pre-Millennial New York City, as nine narrators tell stories that interlock and intersect. The novel won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize (for best work of British literature written by an author under 35) and was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award. His two subsequent novels, number9dream (2001) and Cloud Atlas (2004), were both shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In 2003, he was selected as one of Granta's Best of Young British Novelists. In 2007, Mitchell was listed among Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World. In 2012 his novel Cloud Atlas was made into a film. One segment of number9dream was made into a BAFTA-nominated short film in 2013 starring Martin Freeman, titled The Voorman Problem. In recent years he has also written opera libretti. Wake, based on the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster and with music by Klaas de Vries, was performed by the Dutch Nationale Reisopera in 2010. He has also finished another opera, Sunken Garden, with the Dutch composer Michel van der Aa, which premiered in 2013 by the English National Opera. Several of Mitchell's book covers were created by design duo Kai and Sunny.\\"Kai and Sunny: Publishing\\" Mitchell has also collaborated with the duo, by contributing two short stories to their art exhibits in 2011 and 2014. Mitchell's sixth novel, The Bone Clocks, was published on 2 September 2014. In an interview in The Spectator, Mitchell said that the novel has \\"dollops of the fantastic in it\\", and is about \\"stuff between life and death\\". The Bone Clocks was longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize. Mitchell was the second author to contribute to the Future Library project and delivered his book From Me Flows What You Call Time on 28 May 2016. Utopia Avenue, Mitchell's ninth novel, was published by Hodder & Stoughton on 14 July 2020. Utopia Avenue tells the ‚Äúunexpurgated story‚Äù of a British band of the same name, who emerged from London‚Äôs psychedelic scene in 1967 and was ‚Äúfronted by folk singer Elf Holloway, guitar demigod Jasper de Zoet and blues bassist Dean Moss‚Äù, said publisher Sceptre. Other works In 2015, Mitchell contributed plotting and scripted scenes for the second season of the Netflix show Sense8 by the Wachowskis, who had adapted his novel Cloud Atlas into film. Mitchell had signed a contract to write season three before Netflix cancelled the show. He wrote the series finale special with Lana Wachowski and Aleksandar Hemon. In August 2019, it was announced that Mitchell would continue his collaboration with Lana Wachowski and Hemon on the fourth film in The Matrix series, writing the screenplay with them. Personal life After another stint in Japan, Mitchell currently lives with his wife, Keiko Yoshida, and their two children in Ardfield, Clonakilty in County Cork, Ireland. In an essay for Random House, Mitchell wrote: \\"I knew I wanted to be a writer since I was a kid, but until I came to Japan to live in 1994 I was too easily distracted to do much about it. I would probably have become a writer wherever I lived, but would I have become the same writer if I'd spent the last six years in London, or Cape Town, or Moose Jaw, on an oil rig or in the circus? This is my answer to myself.\\" Mitchell has a stammer\\"Lost for words\\", David Mitchell, Prospect magazine, 23 February 2011, Issue #180 and considers the film The King's Speech (2010) to be one of the most accurate portrayals of what it's like to be a stammerer: \\"I'd probably still be avoiding the subject today had I not outed myself by writing a semi- autobiographical novel, Black Swan Green, narrated by a stammering 13-year- old.\\" Mitchell is also a patron of the British Stammering Association. Mitchell's son is autistic. In 2013 he and his wife Keiko Yoshida translated a book written by Naoki Higashida, a 13-year-old Japanese boy with autism, titled The Reason I Jump: One Boy's Voice from the Silence of Autism. In 2017, Mitchell and his wife translated the follow-up book also written by Higashida, Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8: A Young Man's Voice from the Silence of Autism. Researchers are doubtful that he wrote the book himself, with psychologist Jens Hellman claiming that Higashida's accounts \\"resemble what I would deem very close to an autistic child‚Äôs parents' dream\\". Facilitated communication controversy Mitchell has translated the books The Reason I Jump and Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8 from Japanese to English, which are credited to , a severely autistic Japanese individual. Researchers have doubted that Mitchell should give Higashida credit with writing the original Japanese versions, as those works were done through facilitated communication, which is scientifically debunked. Writing for In-Mind, psychologist Jens Hellman is also skeptical that Higashida should get credit, claiming that Higashida's accounts \\"resemble what I would deem very close to an autistic child‚Äôs parents' dream\\". Higashida can speak but can only repeat certain phrases. Some sources have mistakenly claimed that he is mute. Michael Fitzpatrick, a medical writer known for writing about controversies in autism from the perspective of someone who is both a physician and a parent of a child with autism, said some skepticism of how much Higashida contributed to the book was justified because of the \\"scant explanation\\" of the process Higashida's mother used for helping him write using the character grid and expressed concern that the book \\"reinforces more myths than it challenges\\". Fitzpatrick also disagrees with Mitchell's claim that this book will make parents of severely autistic children feel better, as he reinforces the myth that most severely autistic individuals have significant hidden potential. Sallie Tisdale, writing for The New York Times, said the book raised questions about autism, but also about translation and she wondered how much the work was influenced by the three adults (Higashida's mother, Yoshida, and Mitchell) involved in translating the book and their experiences as parents of autistic children. She concluded, \\"We have to be careful about turning what we find into what we want.\\" Mitchell has claimed in response to skeptics that there are videos of Higashida typing independently; however, Dr. Deborah Fein and Dr. Yoko Kamio claim that in one video where he is featured, his mother is constantly guiding his arm.

He was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 6th district (1946-1948), 26th Attorney General of Virginia (1948-1957) and the 58th Governor of Virginia (1958-1962). He was originally a supporter of Massive resistance to the integration of public schools. When the courts ruled that unconstitutional, he reversed himself and worked with the legislature to end massive resistance. Almond then became an Associate Judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (1962-1973) before becoming Senior Judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (1973-1982). He would ultimately advance to Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1982, and served until his death in 1986. Early life Almond was born in Charlottesville, Virginia and raised in Orange County, Virginia. Almond attended Virginia Tech and served as a private in the Students Army Training Corps in 1917 and 1918 in World War I. Afterwards he taught school in Locust Grove, Orange County, Virginia. He served as a high school principal and earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1923. Retrieved on 2009-9-28 Political career Almond was assistant commonwealth attorney of Roanoke, Virginia from 1930 to 1933 and was a state court judge of the Hustings Court of Roanoke from 1933 to 1945. He was then elected to the United States House of Representatives from Virginia's 6th congressional district, serving in the 79th and 80th Congresses. Almond resigned his Congressional seat in 1948, when he was elected Attorney General of Virginia. He argued the state's case for segregation of public schools before the United States Supreme Court in the case of Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, which was consolidated with Brown v. Board of Education. Virginia lost both in 1954 and 1955.Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Although not a favorite of United States Senator Harry F. Byrd, Almond had demonstrated loyalty to the Byrd Organization as well as the national ticket and racial segregation. Byrd had been offended by Almond's endorsement of Martin Hutchinson for the Federal Trade Commission and had refused to endorse Almond for governor in 1953 so Thomas B. Stanley was nominated and ultimately elected. By 1956, Byrd had announced the organization's policy of massive resistance, and as attorney-general, Almond had defended what became known as the Stanley Plan despite doubts about its constitutionality. In 1957, Almond resigned as attorney general (and Stanley appointed Kenneth Cartwright Patty to fill the rest of the term) and announced early for the Democratic nomination for governor. Almond refused Byrd's offer of a position on the Virginia Supreme Court conditioned upon his endorsing Byrd's preferred nominee, Garland Gray, firmly segregationist in allegiance. Gray then withdrew from the Democratic primary, and Almond easily won the Democratic nomination for Governor of Virginia. His Republican opponent, Theodore Roosevelt Dalton, would have allowed racial integration of the public schools pursuant to court orders. Almond offered segregationist rhetoric in most locations and won election as Virginia's governor a month after President Dwight Eisenhower sent troops to enforce a desegregation order in Little Rock, Arkansas, over the opposition of its governor, Orval Faubus. Almond took office in January 1958 for a volatile term that ended in 1962. On January 19, 1959, the Virginia Supreme Court and a three judge federal panel both found the Stanley Plan unconstitutional. Almond initially protested denouncing the federal court rulings in a fiery speech blasting \\"those whose purpose and design is to blend and amalgamate of the white and negro races\\", and citing \\"the livid stench of sadism, sex immorality, and juvenile pregnancy infesting the mixed schools of the District of Columbia and elsewhere\\", but soon called a special legislative session and announced (to Byrd's fury and that of James J. Kilpatrick, among others) that he would not resist the federal court orders. He allowed public schools in Arlington and Norfolk to desegregate peacefully by to court orders on February 5, 1959.Heinemann pp. 348-349 Heeding the advice of several moderates within his own party, including Senator Mosby Perrow Jr., Almond realized that opposition to desegregation was ultimately futile, as the state continued to lose in the courts. In April 1959, Almond and his lieutenant governor, Allie Edward Stakes Stephens, helped Perrow and Stuart B. Carter of Fincastle, Virginia narrowly secure passage of bills which allowed localities to determine whether to desegregate their schools.Heinemann pp. 350-351 Schools in Albemarle and Warren Counties opened and followed desegregation orders, but the schools in Prince Edward County remained closed until 1963, and the tuition assistance program that supported segregation academies remained in effect until 1968 when the United States Supreme Court decided Green v. County School Board of New Kent County. Thus, except for Prince Edward County, massive resistance had been transformed into passive resistance against school desegregation. However, Harry F. Byrd Jr. and longtime Byrd lieutenant E. Blackburn Moore defeated Almonds' request for a sales tax in 1960, which some saw as retaliation for allowing school desegregation. Stephens resigned just before year end to run for governor (following Almond's early declaration example). However, the Byrd Organization slated Albertis Harrison (the attorney general who had supported segregation and litigation against the NAACP) as their candidate. Stephens lost badly in the 1961 Democratic primary (which ended his elected career), and Byrd loyalist Mills Godwin defeated moderate Armistead Boothe for lieutenant governor, but the machine's vote totals were lower than previously. Both Harrison and Godwin won election in November, with Robert Young Button being elected attorney general.Heinemann pp. 407-409 Federal judicial service After campaigning for President John F. Kennedy in 1960, President Kennedy nominated Almond to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals on April 16, 1962. However Senator Byrd blocked a Senate floor vote and the nomination expired without action. Almond received a recess appointment from President Kennedy on October 23, 1962, to an Associate Judge seat on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals vacated by Associate Judge Ambrose O'Connell. He was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1963. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 28, 1963, 164 days after his nomination (more than a year after the first nomination, which Byrd had said he would not block) when Senator Byrd, who was still blocking his nomination, missed a floor session. Byrd's vindictiveness toward Almond eventually undermined the Byrd Organization.Heinemann, p. 410 Almond received his commission on July 3, 1963. He assumed senior status on March 1, 1973. He was reassigned by operation of law to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on October 1, 1982, pursuant to 96 Stat. 25. His service terminated on April 14, 1986, due to his death. =Elections= *1946; Almond was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election unopposed. He was re-elected in the general election with 64.78% of the vote, defeating Republican Frank R. Angell and Socialist Ruby Mae Wilkes. *1957; Almond was elected Governor of Virginia with 63.15% of the vote, defeating Republican Theodore R. Dalton and Independent C. Gilmer Brooks. Personal life Almond married Josephine Katherine Minter in 1925. He was a Lutheran and taught a men's bible class. He was a 32nd degree Mason, a Shriner, and a member of Alpha Kappa Psi and Omicron Delta Kappa. Death Almond died on April 14, 1986 in Richmond, Virginia. He and his wife Josephine Minter Almond are buried in Evergreen Burial Park in Roanoke, Virginia, in her family's plot. The couple had no children, but had raised one of her nephews as their son.

Historians regard this campaign as the most ambitious Confederate attempt to establish control of the American West and to open an additional theater in the war. It was an important campaign in the war's Trans-Mississippi Theater, and one of the major events in the history of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War. The Confederates advanced north along the Rio Grande from Fort Bliss in Texas. They won the Battle of Valverde but failed to capture Fort Craig or force the surrender of the main Union Army in the territory. They continued north across the border towards Santa Fe and Fort Union, leaving that Union force in their rear. At Glorieta Pass, the Confederates defeated another Union force from Fort Union, but were forced to retreat following the destruction of the wagon train containing most of their supplies. Confederate success in this failed campaign would have denied the Union a major source of the gold and silver necessary to finance its war effort, and the Union navy would have had the additional difficulty of attempting to blockade several hundred miles of coastline in the Pacific. A Confederate victory would have also diverted Union troops which, following the invasion, were used to fight Native American tribes on the plains and in the Rockies. Opposing forces =Union= Union forces in the Department of New Mexico were led by Colonel Edward Canby, who headquartered at Fort Craig. Under his immediate command at the fort were five regiments of New Mexico volunteer infantry,Only the 1st and 2nd regiments had the full ten companies present. the 3rd regiment had eight companies, the 4th had one, and the 5th two companies. a company of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, two provisional artillery units, eleven companies of the 5th, 7th, and 10th U.S. Infantry,Five companies were of the 5th regiment and three each of the 7th and 10th regiments. six companies of the 2nd and 3rd U.S. Cavalry, and two regiments New Mexico militia. At Fort Union, under the command of Colonel Gabriel Paul, were the 1st Colorado Infantry, a company of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, a battalion of the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment, a detachment from the 1st and 3rd U.S. Cavalry, a company of the 4th New Mexico Infantry, and two provisional artillery batteries. =Confederate= The Confederate Army of New Mexico was led by Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley. His units included the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles and 5th Texas Mounted Rifles (both of which had batteries of mountain howitzers), five companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles, six companies of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles with an attached artillery battery, and several companies of Arizona Confederate mounted volunteers. Following his arrival in New Mexico in January, Sibley organized his artillery into a battalion under the command of Captain Trevanion Teel, whom he promoted to major. Five additional companies of the 7th Texas arrived near the end of February and served as the garrison of Fort Thorn at Mesilla. Confederate strategy For years, residents in the southern part of the New Mexico Territory had been complaining that the territorial government in Santa Fe was too far away to properly address their concerns. The withdrawal of the Regular army at the beginning of the war confirmed to the residents that they were being abandoned. Secession conventions in Mesilla and Tucson voted to join the territory to the Confederacy in March 1861, and formed militia companies to defend themselves. In July 1861, Lieutenant Colonel John Baylor led a battalion of Texas mounted rifles into the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory, entering Mesilla and repulsing the attack of the Union garrison of Fort Fillmore at the First Battle of Mesilla. The victorious Baylor established the Confederate Territory of Arizona south of the 34th parallel. The 1862 campaign was a continuation of this strategy formulated by Sibley in a plan presented to Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Sibley's strategy called for an invasion along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, seizing the Colorado Territory (then at the height of the Colorado Gold Rush) and Fort Laramie (the most important United States Army garrison along the Oregon Trail), before turning westward to attack the mineral-rich Nevada and California. He planned to take minimal supplies along with him, intending to live off the land and to capture the stockpiles of supplies at Union forts and depots along the Santa Fe Trail. Once these territories had been secured, Sibley intended to take the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua, Sonora, and Lower California, either through purchase or by invasion. March toward Santa Fe =Sibley's Advance= On December 20, 1861, General Sibley, in command of the Army of New Mexico, issued a proclamation taking possession of New Mexico in the name of the Confederate States.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Vol. IV, p. 89 He called on the citizens to abandon their allegiance to the Union and to join the Confederacy, warning that those \\"who co-operate with the enemy will be treated accordingly, and must be prepared to share their fate.\\" In February 1862, Sibley advanced northward from Fort Thorn up the valley of the Rio Grande, toward the territorial capital of Santa Fe and the Union storehouses at Fort Union. Along the way, Sibley detached 54 men to occupy Tucson. The Confederate advance followed the west bank of the river via Fort Craig, which was garrisoned by a 3,800-man Union force under Canby. Knowing he could not leave such a large Union force behind him as he advanced, Sibley attempted to lure the Union forces out into battle on favorable terms. On February 19, Sibley camped at the sandhills east of the fort with the intention of cutting the Union lines of communications with Santa Fe. On February 20, the Union forces advanced from the fort but were hit with heavy Confederate artillery and were forced to retreat. The next day the Confederates marched to Valverde Ford, north of the fort, in an attempt to outflank the Union forces. Canby attacked, but the Union forces were driven back by the Confederates under Colonel Thomas Green, who took command after Sibley was indisposed (and possibly drunk). Canby's forces retreated to Fort Craig but refused to surrender. Since he had only enough rations for three days, Sibley could not attempt a siege nor retreat back to Mesilla. Instead, he chose to disengage from the fort and continued slowly northward towards Santa Fe, on the other side of the border in New Mexico Territory, hoping to reach the supplies located there and also to cut Fort Craig's lines of supplies and communications. Due to the loss of horses at Valverde, the 4th Texas had to be dismounted, with the remaining horses, already in a weakened state, distributed among the other units. They also had lost much of their transportation in the battle at Valverde, causing them to carry the wounded. All this caused the column to travel slower than it could have. Canby meanwhile attempted to trap Sibley's army between his own force and Fort Union. He disbanded his militia and most of the volunteer units, and sent most of his mounted units northward to act as partisans and to \\"obstruct [Sibley's] movements if he should advance, and cut off his supplies, by removing from his route the cattle, grain, and other supplies in private hands that would aid him in sustaining his force.\\" Starting on February 23, the Confederate forces reached Albuquerque on March 2 and Santa Fe on March 13, but due to their slow advance they failed to capture most of the Union supplies located at these cities. The slow advance also allowed reinforcements from Colorado under the command of Colonel John Slough to reach Fort Union, until this time under Paul's command. Since he had been commissioned colonel before Paul was commissioned the same rank, Slough claimed seniority and took command of the fort. Canby had already ordered Paul to \\"not move from Fort Union to meet me until I advise you of the route and point of junction.\\" After learning of the change in command, Canby told Slough to \\"advise me of your plans and movements, that I may cooperate.\\" He also instructed Slough to \\"harass the enemy by partisan operations. Obstruct his movements and cut off his supplies.\\" Slough interpreted this as an authorization to advance, which he did with men from the fort's garrison. The Union and Confederate forces met at the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28. The Confederates were able to push the Union force through the pass, but had to retreat following the destruction of their wagon train, which contained nearly all of their supplies and ammunition. Sibley pulled his army back to Albuquerque to await reinforcements from Texas. Slough, receiving orders from Canby to return immediately to Fort Union, also retreated, fearing a court martial if he disobeyed this order. Once he arrived at the fort, he resigned his commission and returned to Colorado, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Tappan in command of the regiment and Paul once again in command of the fort. =Sibley's Retreat= Canby initially ordered the Union force to retreat back to Fort Union, but after discovering the weakness of the Confederates he ordered a concentration of Union forces; small garrisons were left at Forts Craig and Union, and the main forces were to rendezvous near Albuquerque. With limited supplies and ammunition and outnumbered, Sibley chose to retreat to Texas, leaving Albuquerque on April 12 after a small fight a few days earlier. On April 14, Canby encountered the Confederates at Peralta, where the armies skirmished until 2:00 p.m. when a sandstorm permitted the Confederates to withdraw to the west bank. Cut off from retreat down the east bank by Union forces, Sibley's army was forced to retreat down the west bank or through the mountains to the west in search of food and water, during which hundreds of Confederates straggled and fell behind. During the retreat, looting, destruction and confiscation of food, and forage by the desperate Confederate soldiers drove New Mexican citizens to resistance along the line of march down the west bank of the Rio Grande. After reaching Mesilla the retreat continued to Franklin and then to San Antonio. A rearguard of four companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles and several companies of Arizona Confederates (consolidated under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Philemon Herbert as the 1st Arizona Mounted Rifles Battalion) was left at Fort Thorn, commanded by Colonel William Steele. With the advance of the California Column closing in from the west, and General Edward Canby's Army approaching from the north, guerillas from the Mesilla area rose against the confiscations of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles and 1st Arizona Mounted Rifles left to garrison the Mesilla Valley. The Second Battle of Mesilla was a skirmish fought in the desert near Mesilla on July 1, 1862 between Confederate Arizona rebels and pro Union New Mexican militia.http://azrebel.tripod.com/page16.html The engagement ended with a Union victory and with the threat of the more numerous Union forces closing in, prompted the rebels to withdraw from Mesilla, retreating into Texas in early July. Aftermath Following the Confederate retreat, units from the Union California Column under the command of Colonel James Carleton occupied several forts in western Texas. Canby was promoted to brigadier general and reassigned to the eastern theater. He was succeeded as commander of the department by Carleton, who was also promoted to brigadier general. The best men from the New Mexico volunteers were formed into the 1st New Mexico Cavalry with Kit Carson in command; the regiment spent the rest of the war fighting Indian tribes in the territory. Although the Confederates continued to consider Arizona part of the Confederacy and made several plans for another invasion, they were never able to put these plans into execution. Sibley's brigade would be called by many the \\"Arizona Brigade\\" and continued to serve in various areas in Texas and Louisiana during the remainder of the war. Sibley would eventually be demoted to directing supply trains in 1863. Battlefields today Approximately of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield is today protected within the Pecos National Historical Park, and the National Park Service allows access on the park's Civil War sites only to permit-holders and guided tours. There are numerous interpretive signs and exhibits around the park and along nearby roads including Interstate 25, which parallels the Santa Fe National Historic Trail through Glorieta Pass. The Valverde battlefield was commemorated by a historical marker along a nearby highway in the corridor known as the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, now a National Historic Trail. The Battle of Peralta (loosely depicted in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) was commemorated by a state historical marker at the north end of the village, now surrounded by suburban development from metropolitan Albuquerque. The Battle of Albuquerque was memorialized on the city's Old Town Plaza including plaques and cannons. The First and Second Battle of Mesilla have an interpretive sign on the Plaza in historic Mesilla, which was the capital of the Confederate Arizona territory during the Civil War, but is now part of metropolitan Las Cruces in far southern New Mexico. Campaign legacy * The name of the town of Albuquerque, Texas was inspired by campaign members' return home to the area following the war.

Background and education Bulwer was the second son of General William Bulwer and his wife, Elizabeth Barbara, daughter of Richard Warburton-Lytton. He was an elder brother of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton, uncle of Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, Viceroy of India, 1876‚Äì1880, and the uncle of Sir Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer. He was educated at Harrow School, Trinity College and then the recently founded Downing College, both at Cambridge. After graduating and touring the continent, he joined the Life Guards in 1824 and exchanged to the 58th Regiment of Foot two years later. Diplomatic and political career Carlo Pellegrini) in Vanity Fair, August 1870 After having unsuccessfully contested Hertford in 1826, Bulwer joined the Diplomatic Service in 1827 and was sent to Berlin in August that year, to Vienna in April 1829 and then to The Hague in April 1830. In July 1830, he entered the House of Commons as MP for the rotten borough of Wilton and was sent to Brussels the following month to report on the Belgian Revolution. A year later, he was returned for Coventry, again in 1833, then for Marylebone in 1835. That year, Bulwer planned to join General Evans, who was raising a legion to help Isabella II of Spain in the First Carlist War, but was instead sent back to the newly independent Belgium as secretary of legation. When a general election was called two years later on the death of William IV, Bulwer decided not to contest his current seat for Marylebone and after having commuted between Parliament and his diplomatics posts for seven years, decided to become a full-time diplomat and was sent to Constantinople. A year later, Bulwer was due to go to St Petersburg after accepting a new post there, but caught a fever just before leaving Constantinople and instead went back to London. Upon his arrival, the government was embroiled in the Bedchamber Crisis and because of the delays involved, Bulwer did not take up his post in Russia and was instead sent to Paris in June 1839. After having dealt with the poor Anglo- French relations prior to the London Straits Convention, Bulwer was sent to Madrid in November 1843 and served there until Narv√°ez instructed him to leave in 1848, after being accused of implicating liberal risings against the former's conservative government. By now a diplomatic embarrassment in Europe, the British government formally showed its support of Bulwer by making him a KCB that year, but sent him far from Europe, to Washington a year later. Bulwer enjoyed his three years in America, having been promoted to GCB during his office, but wished to return to Europe and so was posted to Florence, Tuscany, in 1852. His two years in Italy were largely uneventful and ill health forced him back to London in 1854. He was granted a pension a year later and it was at this time that he and his wife separated. When his health improved, Bulwer was in Eastern Europe from 1856‚Äì58. In 1858, he succeeded Lord Stratford de Redcliffe as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and his wife joined him. This was his final diplomatic post before his semi-retirement in 1865. On his return to England, Bulwer went back to politics and successfully contested Tamworth in 1868. He returned to literature after his retirement and was also raised to the peerage as Baron Dalling and Bulwer, of Dalling in the County of Norfolk, in 1871. Personal life Lord Dalling and Bulwer married the Honourable Georgiana, youngest daughter of Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley and a niece of the Duke of Wellington, at Hatfield House in December 1848. They had no children. On his return from a trip to Egypt in 1872, Bulwer died suddenly in Naples, aged 71, when the barony became extinct. His will was valued at less than ¬£5,000. His estranged wife died in August 1878, aged 61. A Freemason, he became the first District Grand Master for Turkey under the United Grand Lodge of England in 1862.

Horticultural Flora of South-Eastern Australia. UNSW Press, 2002. p. 81. The Latin word saxifraga means literally \\"stone- breaker\\", from Latin ' (\\"rock\\" or \\"stone\\") + ' (\\"to break\\"). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart. Description Most saxifrages are small perennial, biennial (e.g. S. adscendens) or annual (e.g. S. tridactylites) herbaceous plants whose basal or cauline leaves grow close to the ground, often in a rosette. The leaves typically have a more or less incised margin; they may be succulent, needle-like and/or hairy, reducing evaporation. The inflorescence or single flower clusters rise above the main plant body on naked stalks. The small actinomorphic hermaphrodite flowers have five petals and sepals and are usually white, but red to yellow in some species. Stamens, usually 10, rarely 8, insert at the junction of the floral tube and ovary wall, with filaments subulate or clavate. As in other primitive eudicots, some of the 5 or 10 stamens may appear petal-like. and it lives in tundral ecosystems.  Taxonomy  A genus of about 440 species. The former monotypic genus Saxifragella has been submersed within Saxifraga, the largest genus in Saxifragaceae, as Saxifraga bicuspidata. Also the genus Saxifragopsis (strawberry saxifrage) was previously included in Saxifraga. = Subdivision = Based on morphological criteria, up to 15 sections were recognised.

A good number of species grow in glacial habitats, such as S. biflora which can be found some above sea level in the Alps, or the East Greenland saxifrage (S. nathorstii). The genus is also abundant in the Eastern and Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. Though the archetypal saxifrage is a small plant huddling between rocks high up on a mountain, many species do not occur in such a habitat and are larger (though still rather delicate) plants found on wet meadows. Various Saxifraga species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some butterflies and moths, such as the Phoebus Apollo (Parnassius phoebus). Charles Darwin ‚Äì erroneously believing Saxifraga to be allied to the sundew family (Droseraceae) ‚Äì suspected the sticky-leaved round-leaved saxifrage (S. rotundifolia), rue-leaved saxifrage (S. tridactylites) and Pyrenean saxifrage (S. umbrosa) to be protocarnivorous plants, and conducted some experiments whose results supported his observations, but the matter has apparently not been studied since his time. Cultivation thumb Saxifraga urumoffii at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Numerous species and cultivars of saxifrage are cultivated as ornamental garden plants, valued particularly as groundcover or as cushion plants in rock gardens and alpine gardens. Many require alkaline or neutral soil to thrive. S. √ó urbium (London pride), a hybrid between Pyrenean saxifrage (S. umbrosa) and St. Patrick's cabbage (S. spathularis), is commonly grown as an ornamental plant. Another horticultural hybrid is Robertsoniana saxifrage (S. √ó geum), derived from kidney saxifrage (S. hirsuta) and Pyrenean saxifrage. Some wild species are also used in gardening. Cambridge University Botanic Garden hosts the United Kingdom's national collection of saxifrages. =Award of Garden Merit= The following species and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *‚ÄôAngelina Johnson‚Äô (fortunei) *‚ÄôBlackberry and Apple Pie‚Äô (fortunei) *S. callosa (limestone saxifrage) *‚ÄôConwy Snow‚Äô (fortunei) *‚ÄôCoolock Kate‚Äô *‚ÄôCumulus‚Äô *S. fortunei *‚ÄôGregor Mendel‚Äô (√ó apiculata) *‚ÄôLagraveana‚Äô (paniculata) *'Lutea' *'Minor' *‚ÄôMoe‚Äô (fortunei) *‚ÄôMonarch‚Äô *‚ÄôMount Nachi‚Äô (fortunei) *‚ÄôPeach Melba‚Äô *‚ÄôReginald Farrer‚Äô (Silver Farreri Group) *‚ÄôRokujo‚Äô (fortunei) *'Rosea' *‚ÄôShiranami‚Äô (fortunei) *‚ÄôSlack‚Äôs Ruby Southside‚Äô (Southside Seedling Group) *‚ÄôSnowflake‚Äô (Silver Farreri Group) *‚ÄôSouthside Star‚Äô (Southside Seedling Group) *S. stolonifera (strawberry saxifrage) *‚ÄôSue Drew‚Äô (fortunei) *=‚ÄòToujya‚Äô (fortunei) *'Theoden‚Äô *'Tumbling Waters' *S. √ó urbium (London pride) *‚ÄôVenetia‚Äô (paniculata) *‚ÄôWhitehill‚Äô Uses Purple saxifrage (S. oppositifolia) is a popular floral emblem.

This spending is an optional part of fiscal policy, in contrast to entitlement programs for which funding is mandatory and determined by the number of eligible recipients. Some examples of areas funded by discretionary spending are national defense, foreign aid, education and transportation.  United States discretionary spending  In the United States, discretionary spending refers to optional spending set by appropriation levels each year, at the discretion of Congress. During the budget process, Congress issues a budget resolution which includes levels of discretionary spending, deficit projections, and instructions for changing entitlement programs and tax policy. After setting discretionary spending levels, both the House Appropriations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee divide the agreed-upon amount of discretionary spending into twelve suballocations for each of their twelve subcommittees. These subcommittees produce twelve annual appropriation bills for the next fiscal year. While these bills are subject to revision as they move through hearings, markups, Floor consideration, and conference, the level of discretionary spending remains constrained by the budget resolution. Eventually, these twelve bills must be approved by the full Appropriations Committee, followed by both Houses of Congress. Once passed, the president either signs them, vetoes them, or allows them to become law by not signing them within ten days. Graph of U.S. mandatory and discretionary spending from 1966 to 2015. Mandatory spending levels start to diverge from discretionary spending levels in the early 1990s. In 2016, the U.S. federal government spent $1.2 trillion on U.S. discretionary spending. Of this $1.2 trillion, nearly half ($584 billion) was spent on national defense. The rest of U.S. discretionary spending was allocated for education, training, employment, and social services ($92 billion), as well as transportation ($91 billion), veterans' benefits and services ($68 billion), income security ($66 billion), health ($57 billion), administration of justice ($53 billion), international affairs ($52 billion), and other areas related to natural resources, the environment, science, space, and technology ($122 billion).  United States mandatory VS. discretionary spending  In 1962, U.S. discretionary spending made up 47.2% of total U.S. spending, remaining the largest component of federal spending until the mid-1970s. From this time forward, however, discretionary spending levels as a share of total federal spending has decreased significantly. This is largely due to the rapid growth of entitlement spending, also known as mandatory spending. As more participants become eligible for entitlement programs, mandatory spending automatically increases. This trend is projected to continue in the future. In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service, over the next decade, mandatory spending is projected to reach 14% of GDP, while discretionary spending is projected to continue getting smaller, eventually reaching 5% of GDP. By 2022, the Congressional Research Service projects that discretionary spending's share of the economy \\"will be equal to or less than spending in each of the two largest categories of mandatory programs, Social Security and Major Health Programs.\\" Comparison of U.S. discretionary spending on defense and nondefense.

Peel was responsible for \\"artistic direction\\" and the commercial side was handled by Clive Selwood of Elektra Records and his wife Shirley. Peel wrote: Dandelion and the sister publishing company Biscuit were named after Peel's hamsters at the suggestion of his then flatmate Marc Bolan. Around twenty eight albums were released by the label. One album was by Gene Vincent, with a cast of musicians including members of The Byrds and Steppenwolf. Others were by younger or non-commercial artists, including Beau, Bridget St John, Medicine Head, Clifford T. Ward, David Bedford, Lol Coxhill, Stack Waddy, Tractor, Kevin Coyne/Siren, and Denmark's Burnin' Red Ivanhoe. The only record ever to make the UK Singles Chart was \\"(And The) Pictures in the Sky\\" by Medicine Head, which reached #22 in 1971. Beau's \\"1917 Revolution\\" made #1 in the Lebanon in 1969. Dandelion Records were distributed by, successively, CBS Records, Warner Bros. Records and Polydor. The label ran until late 1972 when it started to try to place its artists with other labels as its distribution via Polydor had ceased. It had issued about a dozen singles and two dozen albums. Several releases attracted a cult audience but never quite crossed into the mainstream, although one of the last singles, Clifford T. Ward's 'Coathanger', from his debut album 'Singer Songwriter', attracted a certain amount of airplay on Radio 1. Both Tractor and Medicine Head appeared fairly high in various album charts- Medicine Head would go on to appear on Top of the Pops and Tractor would get heavily involved in the hippy festival circuit which they still make rare appearances on to this day. As Peel himself told Record Collector in 1994, 'when you can't afford full-page ads in the music press, artists become very resentful...there's no faster way of losing friends.' One of the most curious albums issued by the label was a sampler, There is Some Fun Going Forward. Most Dandelion recordings have been reissued on vinyl and/or CD. A batch of half a dozen came out on CD on Repertoire Records in the early 1990s, followed by the whole catalogue as two-on-one CDs by See For Miles Records in the mid-1990s. Individual albums have been licensed around the world, with major catalogue releases since 2005 on Cherry Red Records in the UK and Airmail Archive Recordings in Japan. Cherry Red acquired the entire catalogue of original Dandelion Records recordings (excluding Tractor / The Way We Live) in September 2009. The UK trade mark Dandelion Records and its Dandelion flower logo are the intellectual property of Ozit Morpheus Records who have released new recordings under the Dandelion Records brand. The Dandelion Records by Tractor and The Way We Live were reissued in the 2000s by Ozit Morpheus Records, as was a six-hour DVD about John Peel and some of the artists on Dandelion Records. This was released as a tribute to John in November 2008. It includes a contribution from his wife Sheila Ravenscroft.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1957 until 1970, most notably for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Roseboro, who was a four-time All-Star player and won two Gold Glove Awards, is considered one of the best defensive catchers of the 1960s. He was the Dodgers' starting catcher in four World Series with the Dodgers winning three of those. Roseboro was known for his role in one of the most violent incidents in baseball history when Juan Marichal struck him in the head with a bat during a game in 1965. Baseball career =Early life in professional baseball= Roseboro was born in Ashland, Ohio, and enrolled at Central State University. He was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent prior to the 1952 season and, began his professional baseball career with the Sheboygan Indians of the Wisconsin State League. He posted a .365 batting average with Sheboygan in 1952 to finish second in the league batting championship. Roseboro missed the 1954 season due to military service but, after five years in the minor leagues, he was promoted to the major leagues in June 1957 at the age of 24. =Campanella's heir apparent= During his first season, Roseboro served as backup catcher for the Dodgers' perennial All-Star catcher Roy Campanella and was being groomed to be Campanella's replacement. However, he was promoted to the starting catcher's position ahead of schedule when Campanella had a tragic car accident in January 1958 that ended his career. In his first full season, with the team having moved to Los Angeles, Roseboro hit for a .271 batting average along with 14 home runs and 43 runs batted in. He was also named as a reserve player for the National League in the 1958 All-Star game. In 1959, Roseboro led the league's catchers in putouts and in baserunners caught stealing, helping the Dodgers win the National League Pennant. The Dodgers went on to win the 1959 World Series, defeating the Chicago White Sox in six games. After having a below par season in 1960, Roseboro rebounded in 1961 posting career highs with 18 home runs and 59 runs batted in. He also led the National League catchers in putouts and double plays and finished second in fielding percentage and in assists to earn his first Gold Glove Award when the Dodgers finished the season in second place behind the Cincinnati Reds. He also earned his second All-Star team berth as a reserve player in the 1961 All-Star game. He won his third All-Star berth as a reserve in the 1962 All-Star game. The Dodgers battled the San Francisco Giants in a tight pennant race during the 1962 season with the two teams ending the season tied for first place and met in the 1962 National League tie-breaker series. The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship. Roseboro helped guide the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league leading 2.85 earned run average in 1963 as the Dodgers clinched the National League Pennant by 6 games over the St. Louis Cardinals. Roseboro made his presence felt in the 1963 World Series against the New York Yankees when he hit a three-run home run off Whitey Ford to win the first game of the series. The Dodgers went on to win the series by defeating the Yankees in four straight games. The Dodgers dropped to seventh place in the 1964 season, however Roseboro hit for a career high .287 batting average and led the league's catchers with a 60.4% caught stealing percentage, the ninth highest season percentage in major league history. =Marichal incident= Roseboro was involved in a major altercation with Juan Marichal during a game between the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park on August 22, 1965. The Giants and the Dodgers had nurtured a heated rivalry with each other dating back to their days together in the New York City market. As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Dodgers were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game leading the Milwaukee Braves by half a game and the Giants by one and a half games. The incident occurred in the aftermath of the Watts riots near Roseboro's Los Angeles home and while the Dominican Civil War raged in Marichal's home country, so emotions were raw. Maury Wills led off the game with a bunt single off Marichal, and eventually scored a run when Ron Fairly hit a double. Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills. When Wills came up to bat in the second inning, Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills, sending him sprawling to the ground. Willie Mays then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers' pitcher Sandy Koufax threw a pitch over Mays' head as a token form of retaliation. In the top of the third inning with two outs, Marichal threw a fastball that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground. Marichal's act angered the Dodgers sitting in the dugout and home plate umpire Shag Crawford then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated. Marichal came to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him but instead, he was startled when Roseboro's return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball. When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the proximity of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched. Marichal afterwards stated that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with it, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher's face and required 14 stitches. Koufax raced in from the mound to attempt to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams. A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Giants captain Willie Mays and other peacemakers restored order. Marichal was ejected from the game and afterwards, National League president Warren Giles suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record US$1,750 (), and also forbade him from traveling to Dodger Stadium for the final, crucial two-game series of the season. Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident, but eventually settled out of court for $7,500. Years later, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal's having thrown at Wills. He explained that Koufax would not throw at batters for fear of hurting them due to the velocity of his pitches. He further stated that his throwing close to Marichal's ear was, \\"standard operating procedure\\", as a form of retribution. Marichal didn't face the Dodgers again until spring training on April 3, 1966. In his first at bat against Marichal after the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run. San Francisco General Manager Chub Feeney approached Dodgers General Manager Buzzy Bavasi to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro, but Roseboro declined the offer. Dodger fans remained angry with Marichal for several years after the altercation, and reacted unfavorably when he was signed by the Dodgers in 1975. By then, however, Roseboro had forgiven Marichal, and personally appealed to fans to do the same. =Later career= The Dodgers went on to win the 1965 National League Pennant by two games over the Giants. Even though the Giants won the two games against the Dodgers during which Marichal had been suspended, the outcome of the season may have been different without the Giants' pitcher's suspension, as he finished the season with a 22-13 win-loss record. Roseboro once again guided the Dodgers' pitching staff to a league-leading 2.81 earned run average. He caught for two twenty-game winners in 1965 with Koufax winning 26 games, while Don Drysdale won 23 games. In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James said the decision to give Joe Torre a 1965 National League Gold Glove Award was absurd, stating that he was given the award because of his offensive statistics and that either Roseboro or Tom Haller was more deserving of the award. In the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, Roseboro contributed a two-run single to win Game 3 of the series as, the Dodgers went on to win the world championship in seven games. The Dodgers' pitching staff continued to lead the league in earned-run averages in 1966 as they battled with the San Francisco Giants and the Pittsburgh Pirates in a tight pennant race. The Dodgers eventually prevailed to win the National League Pennant for a second consecutive year. Roseboro led the league with a career-high 903 putouts and finished second to Joe Torre in fielding percentage to win his second Gold Glove Award. The Dodgers would eventually lose the 1966 World Series, getting swept in four games by the Baltimore Orioles. After the Dodgers fell to 8th place, Roseboro, Ron Perranoski and Bob Miller were acquired by the Minnesota Twins, which needed a veteran catcher and left-handed reliever, in exchange for Mudcat Grant and Zoilo Versalles on November 28, 1967.Joyce, Dick. \\"L.A. Trades Roseboro to Twins,\\" United Press International (UPI), Wednesday, November 29, 1967. Retrieved April 18, 2020 While with the Twins, he would be named to his fourth and final All-Star team when he was named as a reserve for the American League team in the 1969 All-Star game. After the season, Roseboro was released by the Twins. He signed as a free agent with the Washington Senators on December 31, 1969 but appeared in only 46 games for the last place Senators. He played in his final major league game on August 11, 1970 at the age of 37. Career statistics In an fourteen-year major league career, Roseboro played in 1,585 games, accumulating 1,206 hits in 4,847 at bats for a .249 career batting average along with 104 home runs, 548 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .326. He had a .989 career fielding percentage as a catcher. Roseboro caught 112 shutouts during his career, ranking him 19th all-time among major league catchers. He was the catcher for two of Sandy Koufax's four no-hitters and caught more than 100 games in 11 of his 14 major league seasons. Baseball historian Bill James ranked Roseboro 27th all-time among major league catchers. Later life After completing his playing career with Washington, Roseboro coached for the Senators (1971) and California Angels (1972‚Äì74). Later, he served as a minor league batting instructor (1977) and catching instructor (1987) for the Dodgers. Roseboro and his wife, Barbara Fouch Roseboro, also owned a Beverly Hills public relations firm. Roseboro appeared as a plainclothes officer in the 1966 Dragnet TV movie. He also appeared as himself in the 1962 film Experiment in Terror along with Don Drysdale and Wally Moon, and as himself in the 1963 Mister Ed episode \\"Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed.\\" Chevrolet was one of the sponsors of the Dodgers' radio coverage in the mid-1960s. The song \\"See the USA in Your Chevrolet\\", made famous by Dinah Shore in the '50s, was sung in Chevrolet commercials by Roseboro and other Dodger players. Dodger announcer Jerry Doggett once joked that Roseboro was a singer \\"whose singing career was destined to go absolutely nowhere.\\" After several years of bitterness over their famous altercation, Roseboro and Marichal became friends in the 1980s. Roseboro personally appealed to the Baseball Writers' Association of America not to hold the incident against Marichal after he was passed over for election to the Hall of Fame in his first two years of eligibility. Marichal was elected in 1983, and thanked Roseboro during his induction speech. \\"There were no hard feelings on my part,\\" Roseboro said, \\"and I thought if that was made public, people would believe that this was really over with. So I saw him at a Dodger old-timers' game, and we posed for pictures together, and I actually visited him in the Dominican. The next year, he was in the Hall of Fame. Hey, over the years, you learn to forget things.\\" Roseboro died of heart disease on August 16, 2002 in Los Angeles at age 69. Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral. \\"Johnny's forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life,\\" he said, at the service. \\"I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher.\\" References External links *John Roseboro at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *John Roseboro at Baseball Library *John Roseboro at Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Professional Baseball League) 1933 births 2002 deaths African-American baseball coaches African-American baseball players African-American basketball coaches American League All-Stars American military personnel of the Korean War Baseball players from Ohio Brooklyn Dodgers players Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) California Angels coaches Caribbean Series managers Caribbean Series players Cedar Rapids Raiders players Central State Marauders baseball players Great Falls Electrics players Gold Glove Award winners Leones del Caracas players Los Angeles Dodgers players Major League Baseball catchers Major League Baseball controversies Minnesota Twins players Montreal Royals players National League All-Stars People from Ashland, Ohio Pueblo Dodgers players Sheboygan Indians players Violence in sports Washington Senators (1961‚Äì1971) coaches Washington Senators (1961‚Äì1971) players ","title":"John Roseboro"},{"id":"1212984","text":"The Shelby GLH-S was a limited production sport compact automobile from the mid-1980s. The main differentiator of these cars from their regular Dodge versions was their use of what would become the intercooled Turbo II engine as well as Shelby Centurian wheels and Koni Adjustable shocks/struts, and changes to the alignment.  1986  The 1986 Shelby Omni GLH-S was a modified Dodge Omni GLH, with changes made at the Shelby factory. They were retitled as Shelby Automobiles cars sold at select Dodge dealerships. GLH stood for \\"Goes Like Hell\\" and GLH-S stood for Goes Like Hell S'more. Just 500 were made. Dash plaques used a 3-digit serial numbering system (as only 500 were made). The Turbo I engine was modified with pre-production pieces from what would become the Turbo II inline-four engine. These changes included an intercooler, plus other changes to produce 175 hp (130 kW) and a flat 175 ft¬∑lbf (237 N¬∑m) torque curve. Not included were any of the durability changes to the short block (forged crank, full floating pin, stouter connecting rods, etc.) of the 1987 Chrysler Turbo II engine. Luckily, the Shelby engines have proved to be reliable even without the durability enhancements of the production Turbo II. Performance was impressive, with just 6.5 s needed for 0-60 mph (97 km/h) and 14.8 s for the quarter mile (402 m) run. Top speed was 135 mph (217 km/h). Shelby Automobiles received the first T-2 induction pieces (prior to Dodge/Chrysler), and installed them on the 500 GLH cars that shipped to the Whittier factory. Engine mods. included: New T-2 fuel rail, T-2 injectors, wiring harness, larger throttle body, bigger turbo, tuned intake & exhaust manifolds, intercooler/rad. & fan assemblies, induction hoses, T-2 airbox, GLH-S specific logic module, CS-Shelby-CS windshield decal, & tape graphics pkg. There was a Dodge emblem left on in production. A black/yellow overlay sticker was placed at the bottom of the speedometer to read to 135 mph . A Momo leather-wrapped shifter knob, Izumi leather-wrapped steering wheel, and shift pattern sticker were also installed. A Use Mobil 1 As Recommended in Shelby GLHS Owner's Manual plaque was affixed to the front of the standard production valve cover. The primary differences between the Shelby engine and the Chrysler Turbo II engine are the torque: Shelby's unique engine computer shaved the torque to save the stock Omni transaxle, Chrysler Turbo II engines had of torque; the trimetal bearings, forged crank and extra oil passages weren't present; and the wiring harness is a conglomeration of original Turbo I, with splicings for the heated oxygen sensor. All-in-all this was a very formidable car, especially on short tracks. In SCCA Solo competition, it was never allowed a place in the stock categories because it failed to meet the required 1000 unit a year production quota. It also was significantly faster In the quarter mile than the Chevrolet Camaro with the 305 V8, Pontiac's Firebird/Trans Am with the 305 V8 and pre-1987 302 V8 Mustangs, and equal or slightly faster than the 1987‚Äì1993 V8 Ford Mustangs and Corvettes. 1987 1987 Shelby GLH-S The 1987 Charger GLH-S was based on the 1987 Shelby Charger. Shelby Automobiles purchased the last 1000 of these & they were shipped to the Whittier factory for modification. Shelby modified the Charger using the same pieces as the 1986 GLH-S with some changes. These included a non EGR turbo, Shelby valve cover, wider Shelby windshield decal (no CS logos), different & more extensive tape graphics package, no reference to Dodge on the outer body, black/white speedo overlay, a 4-digit serial numbering system on the dash plaque, wider Mobil 1 plaque installed on the radiator support, & Centurian II wheels. Notes: The 1987 Charger GLH-S uses 1986 electronics & fault codes. The dash plaque on 1987 GLH-S Chargers read \\"Shelby Automobiles Inc\\", \\"Carroll Shelby\\" autograph and \\"Charger GLH-S ####\\". Some early (low s/n) Charger GLH-S's came with a shortened 1986 GLH-S windshield decal (CS logos removed). All 1986 & 1987 GLH-S's were first run using conventional oil for engine break-in, then filled with Mobil 1 oil. All transaxles came filled with 5-30W engine oil. All GLH-Ss came from Dodge in single stage black (no clearcoat). The turbocharged 2.2-liter engine of a 1987 GLH-S There is at least one odd ball that was painted above the Shelby Factory strobe stripe by a dealership because the car wouldn't sell making it a \\"Dealer option\\" much like the Yenko cars of the 60's and 70's. It's almost hard to believe 'Dealer options' on those cars have added more than 10X the value over the factory production cars. The dealer had red paint added over the black. Because of their close proximity to the Whittier Shelby plant, Anaheim Dodge had at least six 87 GLH-S's on the lot at one time. They sold slowly and in October 1988 they tried this repaint idea to move their very last unit. This vehicle is owned by the California Shelby Dodge Club president. All had the same options which included a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearshift knob, air conditioning, sunroof, non-armrest center console and KONI struts/shocks on all four corners. There was also an allowance made for the 85 mph (140 km/h) speedometer in the form of a sticker which extended the range of the speedometer to an indicated 125 mph (200 km/h). By the time the speedometer had wrapped fully around to the \\"5 mph\\" mark, the car would have been going at 135 mph (217 km/h). There was also a new version of the Shelby \\"Centurion\\" wheel that looked very similar to the Centurion wheels on the 1986 Omni GLH-S, but had the \\"blades\\" turning in the opposite direction. These are commonly known as Centurion II wheels. Accessories One of the most popular performance upgrades for both of these vehicles is the MOPAR Performance Stage II Computer (Logic Module). This increased the boost to 14.7 psi under wide- open throttle, and output was raised to a claimed 205 hp and of torque. Another popular mod was the \\"super 60 kit\\", which was named so because at full output the fuel pump as part of this kit could pump 60 gallons per hour. It included a computer, fuel pump, injectors, turbocharger and camshaft. The fuel injectors were highly sought after by not only GLH/S and later on SRT4 owners, but for Corvette, Camaro and Mustang owners because they were far better than anything that was offered on the market and were a direct fit.

Located south of the Magic Kingdom theme park, the Seven Seas Lagoon serves as a natural buffer between the Magic Kingdom and its parking lot and connects with the adjacent Bay Lake. The lake reaches a depth of . The lagoon is used mainly for recreational boating, as well as by the resort's three Disney Transport ferryboats that transport guests between the Magic Kingdom and the Transportation and Ticket Center.  Uses  General Joe Potter ferryboat, used for transporting guests to the Magic Kingdom. The Seven Seas Lagoon is used for boating activities at the resort. Fishing was not allowed in the lagoon until the mid-1990s, some 25 years after Walt Disney World's opening. However, the plan had existed from the start and fish were set free in the lagoon in 1973. Swimming was originally allowed, but has since been prohibited for safety reasons due to the operation of the rental boats and the existence of a single-cell amoeba Naegleria fowleri identified in the water that has been credited with several illnesses and at least one death. The lagoon is also the site of the Electrical Water Pageant. The lagoon, despite being man-made, is home to native Florida species such as alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles. Islands of the Lagoon There are three islands on Seven Seas Lagoon: Blackbeard Island, Castaway Cay, and Beachcomber Island. =Blackbeard Island= Blackbeard Island is located near the water bridge that connects Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake. =Castaway Cay= The island of Castaway Cay is currently used as the launching point for perimeter fireworks within special events and holidays at Magic Kingdom Park. It also shares the name of the Island accessed by Disney Cruise Line in the Bahamas. =Beachcomber Island= Previously the site of an artificial wave machine for surfing in the early 1970s. It was later discontinued due to issues such as beach erosion, temperamental technology, cost, and navigational issues for watercraft within the lagoon. The artificial wave machine was more than a decade of being out of service when it was refurbished in 1985. The attempt in 1985 led to more beach erosion and later a permanent shutdown and removed. Remnants of machine are still under the surface of the lagoon, as the cost of removal would have been massive. History The original c.1966-67 master plan for Walt Disney World never included plans for the Seven Seas Lagoon, Walt Disney had only envisioned an expanded Bay Lake as a large open body of water. What would become the lagoon was originally conceived as home to various themed resorts which were relatively landlocked which would be separated from the Magic Kingdom by golf courses, an ice rink and a rollerskating dome. Original plans showed the monorail terminating in front of the Magic Kingdom entrance on a linear route with three WEDway People Movers lines connecting guests to the various resorts. This would change all after Walt's death where major changes were made with the design of WDW. Most likely due to the swampy nature of the land, Bay Lake was expanded and the lagoon created from excess water displaced by the theme park, resorts, parking lots, golf courses. The revised plans would see the monorail circle the lagoon with parking and a transportation centre built on the South shore connecting the various resorts. Seven Seas Lagoon was a project the first phase of Resort Developments for the creation of Walt Disney World Resort. Earth exceeding seven million cubic yards was relocated for the creation of the man-made lagoon. The earth that was moved was used to cover the utilidors of the Magic Kingdom Park. =The Walt Disney World Water Ski Show= The Walt Disney World Ski Show was an event held at Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake at Walt Disney World Resort in the 1970s. Shows were held five times daily. The show included eight-person, three-tiered pyramid, an exposition of flex-wing kite flying at 300 feet over the water and a series of jumps over a five and one-half foot ramp. Various characters, such as Dumbo, Goofy, and Pinocchio were in the show. =2016 alligator attack= At around 9:15 p.m. on June 14, 2016, a two-year-old boy wading in the Seven Seas Lagoon at the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa was grabbed and mauled to death by an alligator. His parents tried to intervene, but they were unsuccessful. The boy's intact body was discovered at the bottom of the lagoon at approximately 1:45 p.m. the following afternoon; he was found near where he went missing 12 to 15 yards (11 to 14 m) from the shore in about 6 feet (1.8 m) of water. The medical examiner ruled that the child died of \\"drowning and traumatic injuries.\\" Reuters reported that the resort would put up signs warning guests about alligators and five of them were earlier killed in the search, to examine their stomachs.\\"Orlando alligator: Body of boy seized by alligator found\\" from BBC News Shortly after the incident, Disney temporarily removed several references to alligators from various attractions throughout Disney World. =Terrain adjustments= After the 2016 alligator attack, the beaches and walkways of the Seven Seas Lagoon received an updated shoreline, which now features sharp, giant rocks and roped-off gates dividing guests from the shoreline of the lagoon. Signs warning guests about the wildlife of the lake were added as well.  Bordering resorts  Three resorts border the Seven Seas Lagoon, all of which have beaches. These hotels are the only hotels on Walt Disney World property that are directly serviced by the Walt Disney World Monorail System, allowing full monorail access from these hotels to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and the Transportation and Ticket Center. *Disney's Contemporary Resort **Bay Lake Tower (Disney Vacation Club) *Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa *Disney's Polynesian Resort  References  Walt Disney World Lakes of Orange County, Florida Artificial lakes of the United States Lakes of Florida 1960s establishments in Florida ","title":"Seven Seas Lagoon"},{"id":"1212995","text":"Jeux d‚Äôeau () is a piece for solo piano by Maurice Ravel.

He was an alderman in the former city of St. James from 1961 to 1969 and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1988. He was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party governments of Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley. Biography =Early life= The son of John Mackling, he was born in 1927 and educated in St. James. In 1944 he left high school and was employed with Saskatchewan Pool Elevators for five years. In the early 1940s he was smitten by the social gospel of J. S. Woodsworth and Stanley Knowles. He became an active member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Young People's Movement, becoming its President. In 1949 he went back to school graduating from United College (now the University of Winnipeg) in 1953. He worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway as a yardman for a year, then entered the Manitoba Law School in 1954, graduating in 1958. During his university years he was actively involved in University Mock Parliament as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). His first campaign as a candidate for political office was as a CCF candidate in the 1953 provincial election. He ran in the constituency of Assiniboia and was only narrowly defeated by the incumbent MLA, Reg Wightman. He ran unsuccessfully in several subsequent Provincial elections and once as a Federal CCF candidate in 1957. In the 1950s Mackling and Howard Pawley were regarded as rebels against the CCF establishment in Manitoba. Both opposed the party's decision to dissolve itself into the New Democratic Party. They opposed the new party structure that gave labour unions a separate voting status within the new party. =Political career= Mackling was finally elected to the Manitoba Legislative Assembly in the 1969 election. He was named Attorney General of Manitoba on July 16, 1969, and held the position for the Schreyer government's first term in office. He also served as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from December 18, 1969, to August 1970. As Attorney General, Mackling sought to develop better police-public cooperation introducing a system of cautions for highway traffic first offences and established a Manitoba Police Commission. He established the first Human Rights Commission, the first Ombudsman's Office, the first Law Reform Commission, the first publicly funded Legal Aid system, and the first Criminal Injuries Compensation Program. Under his guidance, numerous old regulatory systems were revised, including the Expropriation Act and the Landlord and Tenant Act. In revising the Landlord and Tenant Act, the old \\"right of restraint\\"‚Äîwhereby landlords could seize a tenant's furniture‚Äîwas abolished and replaced by security deposits and a Rentalsman's Office was created to adjudicate tenancy disputes. There was one issue in Mackling's tenure as Attorney General that was quite controversial. He was regarded as unnecessarily dogmatic by some members of the NDP Caucus and by some civil libertarians for shutting down a theatre which was screening the film Last Tango in Paris without consulting other government ministers. His position was that as Attorney General he could not and would not allow possible political repercussions to influence law enforcement. The Criminal Code defined a combination of violence with a sexual act as obscene and since a violent sexual act was depicted in the movie, it was obscene. He was defeated in the 1973 provincial election. His St. James constituents were angry that he had supported legislation passed by his government that eliminated the City of St. James and merged it with the City of Winnipeg. St. James had been a very prosperous and successful city and his constituents vented their displeasure on him. After his defeat in 1973 he returned to legal practice but was persuaded in 1974 to take on chairmanship of the Manitoba Transport Board and the Manitoba Highways Board. During his highly successful tenure as Chairman of the Transport Board he became Chairman of a Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA) committee where he worked to harmonize motor transport regulations. In 1981 his friend and former colleague, Howard Pawley, persuaded him to run in the upcoming election. He won and defeated George Minaker, a Progressive Conservative government minister who had defeated him in 1973. In 1982 he was appointed Minister of Natural Resources. During his tenure he successfully led the establishment of provincial park planning including the designation of part of the Whiteshell Provincial Park as a wilderness area, the establishment of Atikaki as a wilderness park, the establishment of the first forestry practices guidelines, the restoration of freshwater fish migration through fish ladders and the removal of unnecessary dams and culverts. In 1985 following the death of then Labour Minister Mary Beth Dolin, Mackling was appointed Minister of Labour with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System Act, the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Civil Service Supplementary Severance Benefit Act, and the Public Servants' Insurance Act. He was reelected in the 1986 election against a challenge from a popular Progressive Conservative, Eldon Ross. On April 17, 1986, he continued as Minister of Labour and as Minister Responsible for the Manitoba Telephone System and also took on the Ministry of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. The NDP government was unexpectedly defeated in the Legislature in early 1988 as a result of the defection of Jim Walding, a disgruntled caucus member. Mackling decided not to contest the 1988 election and has not returned to political life since that time. Mackling was the NDP candidate in the federal riding of Provencher during the 2011 federal election. He came second behind Conservative candidate Vic Toews, capturing about 18% of the popular vote. =Personal= He and his wife Patricia Taeko Ono were married in 1956. Patricia's mother, Lucille Ono, was a devoted supporter of the CCF and NDP. In her honour the Manitoba New Democratic Party presents an annual award to a member of the Party in recognition of his or her dedicated support.

The battle ended with a massacre of African-American Union troops and their white officers attempting to surrender, by soldiers under the command of Confederate Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Military historian David J. Eicher concluded: \\"Fort Pillow marked one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history.\\" It remains unclear whether Forrest ordered the massacre, encouraged it, ignored it, or ‚Äì as he later claimed ‚Äì was unaware of it. Background The deployment of black men as U.S. soldiers by the Union, combined with Abraham Lincoln's issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, profoundly angered the Confederates, who called it \\"uncivilized\\". In response, the Confederacy in May 1863 passed a law stating that black U.S. soldiers captured while fighting against the Confederacy would be turned over to the state, where the captured would be tried, according to state laws. Fort Pillow, on the Mississippi River north of Memphis, was built by Confederate Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow in early 1862 and was used by both sides during the war. With the fall of New Madrid and Island No. 10 to Union forces, Confederate troops evacuated Fort Pillow on June 4, in order to avoid being cut off from the rest of the Confederate army. Union forces occupied Fort Pillow on June 6 and used it to protect the river approach to Memphis. The fort stood on a high bluff and was protected by three lines of entrenchments arranged in a semicircle, with a protective parapet thick and high surrounded by a ditch. (During the battle, this design proved to be a disadvantage to the defenders because they could not fire upon approaching troops without mounting the top of the parapet, which subjected them to enemy fire. Because of the width of the parapet, operators of the six artillery pieces of the fort found it difficult to depress their barrels enough to fire on the attackers once they got close.) A Union gunboat, the USS New Era, commanded by Captain James Marshall, was also available for the defense.U.S. Congress JCCW, p. 3. On March 16, 1864, Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest launched a month-long cavalry raid with 7,000 troopers into West Tennessee and Kentucky. Their objectives were to capture Union prisoners and supplies and to demolish posts and fortifications from Paducah, Kentucky, south to Memphis. Forrest's Cavalry Corps, which he called \\"the Cavalry Department of West Tennessee and North Mississippi\\", consisted of the divisions led by Brig. Gens. James R. Chalmers (brigades of Brig. Gen. Robert V. Richardson and Colonel Robert M. McCulloch) and General Abe Buford (brigades of Cols. Tyree H. Bell and A. P. Thompson). The first of the two significant engagements in the expedition was the Battle of Paducah on March 25, where Forrest's men did considerable damage to the town and its military supplies. Forrest had tried to bluff U.S. Col. Stephen G. Hicks into surrender, warning \\"if I have to storm your works, you may expect no quarter\\". Hicks rejected the demand, as he knew that the fort could not be easily taken. Numerous skirmishes occurred throughout the region in late March and early April. Needing supplies, Forrest planned to move on Fort Pillow with about 1,500Foote, p. 108. to 2,500NPS website men. (He had detached part of his command under Buford to strike Paducah again.) He wrote on April 4, \\"There is a Federal force of 500 or 600 at Fort Pillow, which I shall attend to in a day or two, as they have horses and supplies which we need.\\"Eicher, p. 655. The Union garrison at Fort Pillow consisted of about 600 men, divided almost evenly between black and white troops. The black soldiers belonged to the 6th U.S. Regiment Colored Heavy Artillery and a section of the 2nd Colored Light Artillery (previously known as the Memphis Battery Light Artillery (African Descent)), under the overall command of Major Lionel F. Booth, who had been in the fort for only two weeks. Booth had been ordered to move his regiment from Memphis to Fort Pillow on March 28 to augment the cavalry, who had occupied the fort several weeks earlier. Many of the regiment were former slaves who understood the personal cost of a loss to the Confederates‚Äîat best an immediate return to slavery rather than being treated as a prisoner of war. They had heard that some Confederates threatened to kill any black Union troops they encountered. The white soldiers were predominantly new recruits from Bradford's Battalion, a Union unit from west Tennessee, commanded by Maj. William F. Bradford.Bradford's unit was organized as the 13th West Tennessee Cavalry. Due to a mix-up in the Union records, it was later designated as Company A, 14th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment, and later as Company E, 6th Tennessee Cavalry. Battle Forrest arrived at Fort Pillow at 10:00 on April 12. By this time, Chalmers had already surrounded the fort. A stray bullet struck Forrest's horse, felling the general and bruising him. This was the first of three horses he lost that day.Foote, p. 109. He deployed sharpshooters around the higher ground that overlooked the fort, bringing many of the occupants into their direct line of fire. Major Booth was killed by a sharpshooter's bullet to the chest and Bradford assumed command. By 11:00, the Confederates had captured two rows of barracks about from the southern end of the fort. The Union soldiers had failed to destroy these buildings before the Confederates occupied them, and they subjected the garrison to a murderous fire. Rifle and artillery fire continued until 3:30, when Forrest sent a note demanding surrender: \\"The conduct of the officers and men garrisoning Fort Pillow has been such as to entitle them to being treated as prisoners of war. I demand the unconditional surrender of the entire garrison, promising that you shall be treated as prisoners of war. My men have just received a fresh supply of ammunition, and from their present position can easily assault and capture the fort. Should my demand be refused, I cannot be responsible for the fate of your command.\\" Bradford replied, concealing his identity as he did not wish the Confederates to realize that Booth had been killed, requesting an hour for consideration.http://thisweekinthecivilwar.com/?p=1816 On this date in Civil War history ‚Äì Fort Pillow Massacre ‚Äì April 12, 1864 Forrest, who believed that reinforcing troops would soon arrive by river, replied that he would only allow 20 minutes, and that \\"If at the expiration of that time the fort is not surrendered, I shall assault it.\\"Moody, John Sheldon, et al., The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Series 1, Part 1. Vol. 32. (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1891), p. 596. Bradford refused this opportunity with a final reply: \\"I will not surrender.\\" Forrest then ordered his bugler to sound the charge. The Confederate assault was furious. While the sharpshooters maintained their fire into the fort, a first wave entered the ditch and stood while the second wave used their backs as stepping stones. These men then reached down and helped the first wave scramble up a ledge on the embankment. All of this proceeded flawlessly and with very little firing, except from the sharpshooters and around the flanks. Their fire against the New Era caused the sailors to button up their gun ports and hold their fire. As the sharpshooters were signaled to hold their fire, the men on the ledge went up and over the embankment, firing now for the first time into the massed defenders. The garrison fought briefly, but then broke and ran to the landing at the foot of the bluff, where they had been told that the Union gunboat would cover their withdrawal by firing grapeshot and canister rounds. Because its gun ports remained sealed, the gunboat did not fire a single shot. The fleeing soldiers were subjected to fire both from the rear and from the flank. Many were shot down. Others reached the river only to drown, or be picked off in the water by marksmen on the bluff. Massacre A hand-colored 1885 print titled \\"The Fort Pillow Massacre\\" by Chicago-based Kurz and Allison, included in a series of commemorative prints of Civil War battles. It depicts women and children among the victims, though this is not supported by witnesses, who said that women and children had been removed from the fort prior to the battle.Williams, Harry, \\"Benjamin F. Wade and the Atrocity Propaganda of the Civil War\\", Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quarterly, Vol. 48, p. 40. Although Confederate sources say that Forrest's forces kept firing in self-defense,Cottrell, Steve, Civil War in Tennessee, p.112 some historians and official Union reports emphasize that a deliberate massacre took place. Union survivors claimed that even though all their troops surrendered, Forrest's men massacred some in cold blood. Surviving members of the garrison said that most of their men surrendered and threw down their arms, only to be shot or bayoneted by the attackers, who repeatedly shouted, \\"No quarter! No quarter!\\"Bailey, p. 25. It was reported that women and children were killed, but this was disputed by Dr. C. Fitch, who was surgeon of the Fort Pillow garrison: \\"Early in the morning all of the women and all of the noncombatants were ordered on to some barges, and were towed by a gunboat up the river to an island before any one was hurt.\\"Southern Historical Society Papers, Vol. VII, p. 439 This is supported by the testimony of Captain Marshall. He stated that all the women, children, and sick soldiers were removed to an island before the battle started. The strongest evidence that the Confederates did not kill women and children is that no one reported seeing the bodies of women and children among the slain.Castel, Albert, Winning and Losing in the Civil War: Essays and Stories, p. 47 The Joint Committee On the Conduct of the War immediately investigated the incident, which was widely publicized in the Union press. Stories appeared April 16 in The New York Times, New York Herald, New-York Tribune, Chicago Tribune, Cincinnati Gazette, and St. Louis Missouri Democrat, based on telegraph reports from Cairo, Illinois, where the steamer Platte Valley, carrying survivors, had called so that they could be taken to a hospital at nearby Mound City, Illinois, and those that had expired on the ship could be buried. In their report, from which the previous quotes were taken, they concluded that the Confederates shot most of the garrison after it had surrendered. A letter from one of Forrest's own sergeants, Achilles V. Clark, writing to his sisters on April 14, reads in part: A 2002 study by Albert Castel concluded that Forrest's troops had killed a large number of the garrison \\"after they had either ceased resisting or were incapable of resistance\\".Castel, p.48 Historian Andrew Ward in 2005 reached the conclusion that an atrocity in the modern sense occurred at Fort Pillow, but that the event was not premeditated nor officially sanctioned by Confederate commanders. Recent histories concur that a massacre occurred. Historian Richard Fuchs, the author of An Unerring Fire, concludes, \\"The affair at Fort Pillow was simply an orgy of death, a mass lynching to satisfy the basest of conduct‚Äîintentional murder‚Äîfor the vilest of reasons‚Äîracism and personal enmity.\\"Richard Fuchs, An Unerring Fire: The Massacre At Fort Pillow (Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania: Stackpole, 2002), p. 14. Ward states, \\"Whether the massacre was premeditated or spontaneous does not address the more fundamental question of whether a massacre took place ... it certainly did, in every dictionary sense of the word.\\"Ward (2005), p. 227. John Cimprich states, \\"The new paradigm in social attitudes and the fuller use of available evidence has favored a massacre interpretation. ... Debate over the memory of this incident formed a part of sectional and racial conflicts for many years after the war, but the reinterpretation of the event during the last thirty years offers some hope that society can move beyond past intolerance.\\"John Cimprich, Fort Pillow: A Civil War Massacre and Public Memory(Louisiana State University Press, 2005), pp. 123‚Äì24. Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn of the 6th U.S. Heavy Artillery (Colored) stated in his official report, \\"There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring they never would surrender or ask for quarter.\\" Another officer of the unit, however, and the only surviving officers of Bradford's Battalion, attested to the characterization that unarmed soldiers were killed in the act of surrendering. Confederate Sergeant Clark, in a letter written home shortly after the battle, said that \\"the poor, deluded negroes would run up to our men, fall upon their knees, and with uplifted hand scream for mercy, but were ordered to their feet and then shot down.\\"Foote, pp. 111‚Äì12. This account is consistent with the relatively high comparative casualties sustained by race of the defenders. Forrest's men insisted that the Union soldiers, although fleeing, kept their weapons and frequently turned to shoot, forcing the Confederates to keep firing in self-defense. Their claim is consistent with the discovery of numerous Union rifles on the bluffs near the river.Jordan The Union flag was still flying over the fort, which indicated that the force had not formally surrendered. A contemporary newspaper account from Jackson, Tennessee, states that \\"General Forrest begged them to surrender\\", but \\"not the first sign of surrender was ever given\\". Similar accounts were reported in both Southern and Northern newspapers at the time.Cimprich and Mainfort, pp. 293‚Äì306. Historian Allan Nevins wrote that although the interpretation of the facts had \\"provoked some disputation\\": The New York Times reported on April 24: Forrest's dispatch stated: General Ulysses S. Grant quoted Forrest's dispatch in his Personal Memoirs and commented: \\"Subsequently, Forrest made a report in which he left out the part which shocks humanity to read.\\"U.S. Grant, Personal Memoirs (Library of America, 1990), p. 483.Chernow, 2017, p. 373 John Fisher, in his book They Rode with Forrest and Wheeler, wrote, \\"Grant refers here to two reports from Forrest to his superior officer, Leonidas Polk: (1) a hasty, exuberant report dated April 15, 1864, dashed off three days after the attack on Fort Pillow, describing the success of Forrest's recent operations in West Tennessee, and (2) a well-defined, detailed, and comprehensive report of the action at Fort Pillow only dated April 26.\\"Fisher, pp. 145‚Äì46. At the time of the massacre, General Grant was no longer in Tennessee, but had transferred to the east to command all Union troops.William T. Sherman, Memoirs of General W.T. Sherman (Library of America, 1990), p. 463. Major General William Tecumseh Sherman, Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which included Tennessee, wrote: Military aftermath Casualty figures vary according to the source. In 1908, Dyer gave the following statistics of Union casualties: 350 killed and mortally wounded, 60 wounded, 164 captured and missing, 574 aggregate.Dyer, Frederick H., A Compendium of the War of Rebellion (Des Moines: The Dyer Publishing Company 1908), p. 590. Confederate casualties were comparatively low (14 killed and 86 wounded), and Union casualties were high. Of the 585 to 605 Union men present, 277 to 297 were reported as dead. Jordan in the mid-20th century suggested the Union deaths were exaggerated. Historians agree that defenders' casualties varied considerably according to race. Only 58 (around 20%) black soldiers were marched away as prisoners, whereas 168 (about 60%) of the white soldiers were taken prisoner. Not all of the prisoners who were shot were black; Major Bradford was apparently among those shot after surrendering.Eicher, p. 657; U.S. Congress JCCW, p. 103. Confederate anger at the thought of black men fighting them and their initial reluctance to surrender (many of the black troops believed they would be killed if they surrendered in Union uniform) resulted in a tragedy. The Confederates evacuated Fort Pillow that evening, and so gained little from the battle except causing a temporary disruption to Union operations. Union forces used the \\"Fort Pillow massacre\\" as a rallying cry in the following months. For many, it strengthened their resolve to see the war to its conclusion. On April 17, 1864, in the aftermath of Fort Pillow, General Grant ordered General Benjamin F. Butler, who was negotiating prisoner exchanges with the Confederacy, to demand that black soldiers be treated identically to whites in the exchange and treatment of prisoners. He directed that a failure to do so would \\"be regarded as a refusal on their part to agree to the further exchange of prisoners, and [would] be so treated by us.\\"Fuchs, pp. 143‚Äì44. This demand was refused; Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon in June 1864 wrote: The Union already had established a policy to discourage killing and enslaving prisoners of war. On July 30, 1863, before the massacre, President Abraham Lincoln wrote his Order of Retaliation: This policy did not lead to any action, but the threat of action led the Confederate army tacitly to treat Union negro soldiers as legitimate soldiers, rather than insurrecting slaves, for the remainder of the war. Nevertheless, the same merciless behavior was exhibited by Southern troops after the Battle of the Crater in July 1864, where surrendering black soldiers were shot rather than taken prisoner. Political aftermath On May 3, 1864, Lincoln asked his cabinet for opinions as to how the Union should respond to the massacre.Lincoln, Abraham. \\"Abraham Lincoln to Cabinet, Tuesday, May 03, 1864 (Fort Pillow massacre)\\". Abraham Lincoln Papers at the Library of Congress. May 3, 1864 (accessed December 1, 2012). Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P.

Legacy Fort Pillow, preserved as the Fort Pillow State Historic Park, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. The remains of the killed were moved to Memphis National Cemetery in 1867. 109 of the graves have been identified. As the signage at the Fort Pillow site makes little reference to the black soldiers killed, a wreath-laying ceremony, with color guard and 21-gun salute, was held on April 12, 2017 at the Cemetery to commemorate them. James Lockett compared the Confederacy's policy toward colored Union troops‚Äî\\"no quarter\\"‚Äîwith the lynching and other violence against blacks subsequent to the war. In Southern minds, according to this writer, just as slaves could not be voters or office-holders, they could not be soldiers either, and thus were not treated, at Fort Pillow and elsewhere, as surrendering soldiers. In popular culture Numerous novelists have included the Fort Pillow story, including Frank Yerby's The Foxes of Harrow, James Sherburne's The Way to Fort Pillow; Allen Ballard, Where I'm Bound; Jesse Hill Ford, The Raider; and Charles Gordon Yeager, Fightin' with Forest. * At the start of chapter 29 of his Life on the Mississippi (1883), Mark Twain mentions passing by \\"... what was once the formidable Fort Pillow, memorable because of the massacre perpetrated there during the war ... we must bunch Anglo-Saxon history together to find the fellow to the Fort Pillow tragedy.\\" * African- American novelist Frank Yerby provided a brief narration of the massacre in his 1946 novel, The Foxes of Harrow (chapter XXXVI). * Perry Lentz's novel The Falling Hills (1967, paperback 1994) centers on the Fort Pillow Massacre as its main plot element, with the book's two protagonists as members of the opposing sides in the battle. * The film Last Stand at Saber River (1997), based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, featured a character (played by Tom Selleck) who was a Confederate soldier at the Fort Pillow massacre. The character returns to his home in the U.S. Southwest, where he describes the events as murder. * In 1999, Stan Armstrong produced the documentary The Forgotten Battle of Fort Pillow. It explores the details of the battle and Confederate General Bedford G.

Early life Holloway was born in Devonport, Plymouth, Devon, the eldest son of Thomas and Mary Holloway (n√©e Chellew), who at the time of their son's birth had a bakery business. They later moved to Penzance, Cornwall, where they ran The Turk's Head Inn. In the late 1820s, Holloway went to live in Roubaix, France, for a few years. He returned to England in 1831 and worked in London as a secretary and interpreter for a firm of importers and exporters. In 1836, he set himself up as a foreign and commercial agent in London. Success in business Holloway had business connections with an Italian, Felix Albinolo, who manufactured and sold a general purpose ointment. This gave Holloway the idea to set up a similar business himself in 1837. He began by using his mother's pots and pans to manufacture his ointment in the family kitchen. Seeing the potential in patent medicines, Holloway soon added pills to his range of products. Holloway's business was extremely successful. A key factor in his enormous success in business was advertising, in which Holloway had great faith. Holloway's first newspaper announcements appeared in 1837, and by 1842 his yearly expenses for publicity had reached over ¬£5,000 (GBP). By the time of his death, he was spending over ¬£50,000 a year on advertising his products. The sales of his products made Holloway a multi-millionaire, and one of the richest men in Britain at the time. Holloway's products were said to be able to cure a whole host of ailments, though scientific evaluation of them after his death showed that few of them contained any ingredients which would be considered to be of significant medicinal value. Holloway's medicine business slowly declined and was bought by rival Beecham's Pills in 1930.TAB Corley: Holloway, Thomas (1800‚Äì1883, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 4 April 2013 Philanthropy Holloway is best remembered for the two large institutions which he built in England: Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey, and Royal Holloway College, a college of the University of London in Englefield Green, Surrey. Both were designed by the architect William Henry Crossland, and were inspired by the Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, and the Ch√¢teau de Chambord in the Loire Valley, France. They were founded by Holloway as \\"Gifts to the nation\\". Holloway claimed that it was his wife, Jane Holloway, who inspired him to found the college, which was a women-only college and did not accept male undergraduates until 1965, although postgraduates were accepted in 1945.Bingham, Caroline (1987). The history of the Royal Holloway College 1886‚Äì1986. London: Constable. . Holloway also paid over ¬£80,000 to acquire 77 Victorian era paintings which he donated to the college at the time of its founding. Most of these pieces of art still belong to the college, and remain on display today in the college's Picture Gallery. Three of the paintings, by Turner, Constable and Gainsborough were sold in the 1990s. Tittenhurst Park Holloway had become extremely wealthy by the late 1860s and bought a Georgian House at Sunninghill, near Ascot, Berkshire called Tittenhurst Park. Holloway lived there with his wife, Jane. Her sister, Sarah Anne Driver, also lived there with her husband George Martin, as did Holloway's sister Matilda, an invalid who died soon after. Jane died in 1875, aged 61; Holloway died there on 26 December 1883, aged 83. A century later, from 1969‚Äì71, the building became the home of John Lennon with his then new wife Yoko Ono, having been married on 20 March 1969 in Gibraltar. Another member of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, lived there after Lennon until the late-1980s. In 1988, the property was sold to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi. Since then major renovation of the manor has been carried out, and the interior no longer resembles the house lived in by Lennon and Starr. Death Thomas Holloway's grave at St. Michael and All Angels Church, Sunninghill, Berkshire. A philanthropic and somewhat eccentric donor (he had an unconcealed prejudice against doctors, lawyers and parsons), Holloway died of congestion of the lungs at Sunninghill in 1883, eighteen months before the opening of the Holloway Sanatorium. He is buried with his wife Jane in a family grave at Sunninghill churchyard. A display about his life was unveiled at the church in October 2014 by Royal Holloway's Principal, Professor Paul Layzell.

Early life Wojtowicz was the son of a Polish father and an Italian-American mother. He served in the United States army and was posted to Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Personal life Wojtowicz married Carmen Bifulco in 1967. They had two children and separated in 1969. In 1971, Wojtowicz met Elizabeth Eden at the Feast of San Gennaro in New York City. The two had a public wedding ceremony that year. Bank robbery On August 22, 1972, Wojtowicz, along with Salvatore Naturale and Robert Westenberg, attempted to rob a branch of the Chase Manhattan bank at 450 Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The Los Angeles Times reported the heist was meant to pay for Eden's gender reassignment surgery. However, Arthur Bell, a respected Village Voice columnist and investigative journalist who knew Wojtowicz (and was tangentially involved in the negotiations), reported that paying for Eden's gender confirmation was only peripheral to the real motive. The attempted heist was, according to him, a well-planned Mafia operation that went horribly wrong. First-person account by reporter and Gay Liberation activist, of his acquaintance with Wojtowicz and his involvement in events. Wojtowicz and Naturale held seven Chase Manhattan bank employees hostage for 14 hours. Westenberg fled the scene before the robbery got underway after he saw a police car on the street. Wojtowicz, a former bank teller, had some knowledge of bank operations. Naturale was killed by the FBI during the final moments of the incident; Wojtowicz was arrested. Aftermath According to Wojtowicz, he was offered a deal for pleading guilty, which the court did not honor, and on April 23, 1973, he was sentenced to 20 years in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, of which he served five. Wojtowicz was released from prison on April 10, 1978, but was arrested again and served two more sentences in prison for parole violations in 1984 and from 1986-87. He was released in April 1987 and, he said, Eden visited him in New York about once a month. Eden, who married someone else and then divorced, died of AIDS-related pneumonia at Genesee Hospital, in Rochester, New York, on September 29, 1987. Wojtowicz attended her funeral and delivered a eulogy. =Dog Day Afternoon= Wojtowicz's story was used as the basis for the film Dog Day Afternoon (released in 1975), starring Al Pacino as Wojtowicz (called \\"Sonny Wortzik\\" in the film) and John Cazale, one of Pacino's co-stars in The Godfather, as Naturale. Elizabeth Eden, known as \\"Leon\\" in the film, was portrayed by actor Chris Sarandon. In 1975, Wojtowicz wrote a letter to The New York Times out of concern that people would believe the movie version of the events, which he said was only 30% accurate. Wojtowicz's main objection was the inaccurate portrayal of his wife Carmen Bifulco as a plain, overweight woman whose behavior led to his relationship with Eden, when in fact he had left Bifulco two years before he met Eden. Other concerns he had that were fictionalized in the movie were that he never spoke to his mother and that the police refused to let him speak to his wife Carmen. In addition, the movie insinuated that Wojtowicz had \\"sold out\\" Naturale to the police, and although Wojtowicz claimed this was untrue, several attempts were made on his life following an inmate screening of the movie. Wojtowicz praised Pacino and Sarandon's characterizations of himself and Elizabeth Eden as accurate. In a 2006 interview, the movie's screenwriter, Frank Pierson, said that he tried to visit Wojtowicz in prison many times to get more details about his story when he wrote the screenplay, but Wojtowicz refused to see him because he felt he was not paid enough money for the rights to his story. Either way, the film was very successful, receiving good reviews and winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 1976 ceremony. Documentary The Making of Dog Day Afternoon, Disc 2 of the two-disc Special Edition DVD. Later years and death In 2001, The New York Times reported that Wojtowicz was living on welfare in Brooklyn. Section E; Part 2. He died of cancer on January 2, 2006, in his mother's home, aged 60. Documentaries Wojtowicz was the subject of multiple documentaries: *The Third Memory (1999), directed by artist Pierre Huyghe and first exhibited in a museum context at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and The Renaissance Society in Chicago (in the format of a two-channel video), took Dog Day Afternoon as its starting point and depicts Wojtowicz recreating the events of bank robbery with actor look-a-likes and props on a reconstruction of the set of Lumet's film. Juxtaposed with footage from Dog Day Afternoon, it demonstrates that Wojtowicz's memory appears to have been irrevocably altered by the film about his life. For example, he speculated that President Richard Nixon personally ordered the FBI killing of Salvatore because live news media coverage following the bank robbery that evening was cutting into the network television broadcast of Nixon's re-election acceptance speech at the 1972 Republican National Convention, at The Convention Center in Miami Beach. *Based on a True Story (2004) *The Dog (also known as Storyville: The Great Sex Addict Heist), 10 years in the making by directors Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2013.

He was the Member of Parliament for Midlothian from 1906 to 1910. He became the Earl of Rosebery and Midlothian in 1929 and was thus a member of the House of Lords until his death. Early life and education He was born at Dalmeny House west of Edinburgh on 8 January 1882. His parents were Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (from 1894‚Äì95) and Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery, a member of the Rothschild family. He was the brother of Neil Primrose and the writer Lady Sybil Grant. He was educated at Eton then undertook military training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Military career Lord Dalmeny was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards as a Second lieutenant 12 February 1902. During the First World War, he served in France from 1914‚Äì17 as Camp Commandant and ADC to General Allenby and subsequently in Palestine as Allenby's Military Secretary. Cricket career As Lord Dalmeny he was a prominent cricketer. He played two first-class matches for Middlesex in 1902. He served as captain of Surrey from 1905 to 1907. He played in 102 first-class matches in all, scoring 3551 runs at an average of 22.47, including two centuries. His highest score was 138 against Leicestershire in 1905, when he added 260 for the sixth wicket in 130 minutes with J. N. Crawford.Wisden 1975, p. 1082. He was a hitter of notable powerWisden 1906, p. 136. and though never consistent he could on occasions \\"knock the best bowling all over the field\\", as when he hit 58 against Nottinghamshire on a difficult wicket at The Oval in 1905. Against Essex in 1906 he scored 52 in 37 minutes in the first innings and 58 not out in 45 minutes in the second.Cricket, 22 August 1907, p. 362. Rosebery was also a notable race-horse owner. He won The Derby with Blue Peter and Ocean Swell, and won most other classic British flat races, with horses bred at his Mentmore and Crafton Studs. Political career and later life He commenced his political career by being elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Scottish seat of Edinburghshire. This was a county, better known by its modern name of Midlothian, which was an area where the Roseberys had long been prominent landowners. Dalmeny was one of almost 400 Liberals returned in the great landslide victory of the 1906 election. He retired from the House of Commons in January 1910. At the time of his death he was the last survivor of the 1906 Liberal MPs. Rosebery entered the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1929. The same year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Midlothian, a post he held until 1964. In 1938 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Hugh Macmillan, Baron Macmillan, Sir Thomas Henry Holland, James Pickering Kendall and James Watt. In February 1941, during the Second World War, he was appointed Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence in Scotland. When the wartime coalition government broke up in 1945, Winston Churchill formed a caretaker administration to hold office until the 1945 general election. The new government was composed of members of the Conservative Party and the small groups which had allied with it in the National governments in office 1931‚Äì1940. Amongst these allies was the National Liberal Party to which Rosebery belonged. One of the most unexpected appointments Churchill made was to install Rosebery as a member of the Privy Council and Secretary of State for Scotland. Both men had served together in the Liberal Parliamentary Party in the 1906‚Äì1910 Parliament. The caretaker Ministry was in office May to July 1945. So brief was his tenure at the Scottish Office that during the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs (1952-4) he declined to give evidence on the grounds that he did not know what to say.Pottinger, George, The Secretaries of State for Scotland, 1926-1976 (Scottish Academic Press, 1979), p.100. Reputedly, his last words prior to his departing from the Scottish Office were \\"Well. I didn't make a bad job of this, did I? Didn't have the time\\".Young, Kenneth, Harry, Lord Rosebery, (London, 1974) He was created a Knight of the Order of the Thistle (KT) in 1947 by King George VI. Rosebery was President of the National Liberal Party 1945‚Äì1957. He was also appointed Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland in 1952. He died at Mentmore House in Buckinghamshire on 30 May 1974. Family In 1909, Harry Primrose married Dorothy Alice Margaret Augusta Grosvenor, daughter of Lord Henry George Grosvenor. They had a son, Archie Primrose, Lord Dalmeny (1910‚Äì1931), and a daughter, Lady Helen Dorothy Primrose (1913‚Äì1998). They divorced in 1919. Harry Primrose remarried in 1924, to Dame Eva Isabel Marian Strutt (DBE), daughter of the 2nd Baron Aberdare of Duffryn. Their only child, Neil Archibald Primrose, was born in 1929, and became the 7th Earl of Rosebery on the death of his father on 31 May 1974.

InsP3R is very diverse among organisms, and is necessary for the control of cellular and physiological processes including cell division, cell proliferation, apoptosis, fertilization, development, behavior, learning and memory. Inositol triphosphate receptor represents a dominant second messenger leading to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites. There is strong evidence suggesting that the InsP3R plays an important role in the conversion of external stimuli to intracellular Ca2+ signals characterized by complex patterns relative to both space and time, such as Ca2+ waves and oscillations. Discovery The InsP3 receptor was first purified from rat cerebellum by neuroscientists Surachai Supattapone and Solomon Snyder at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The cDNA of the InsP3 receptor was first cloned in the laboratory of Katsuhiko Mikoshiba. The initial sequencing was reported as an unknown protein enriched in the cerebellum called P400. The large size of this open reading frame indicated a molecular weight similar to the protein purified biochemically, and soon thereafter it was confirmed that the protein p400 was in fact the inositol trisphosphate receptor. Distribution The receptor has a broad tissue distribution but is especially abundant in the cerebellum. Most of the InsP3Rs are found integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum. Structure The asymmetric structure consists of an N-terminal beta-trefoil domain and a C-terminal alpha helical domain with a folding pattern similar to an armadillo repeat fold. The split formed by the two terminals contains multiple arginine and lysine residues that coordinate the three phosphoryl groups of InsP3R. The InsP3R complex is formed of four 313 kDa subunits. In amphibians, fish and mammals, there are 3 paralogs and these can form homo- or hetero-oligomers. InsP3R-1 is the most widely expressed of these three and is found in all tissue types and all developmental stages of life. It is additionally the means for further InsP3 receptor diversity in that it has as many as four splice sites with as many as 9 different optional exons or exon variants. Combinations of these can be introduced into a given transcript in order to modulate its pharmacological activity.

By 1949 the group had official connections with the Czech Philharmonic. The first foreign tour was in 1949, to Poland, and the first recording was of a quartet by Bed≈ôich Smetana in 1950. Rybensk√Ω was obliged to retire after ill health in 1952, and was replaced by Milan ≈†kampa. The performers were appointed professors at the Academy of Musical Arts in 1967.

There are currently two versions available: Korean Mir and Chinese Mir. The European version (published by Game Network) came to a close on 31 March 2009, after running for 8 years, and the North American version (published by Gamepot) came to a close on 14 May 2012. Whilst being moderately successful in Europe, it has been incredibly well received in Asia and was the most popular MMORPG in China in 2002 and 2003, with over 250,000 simultaneous users being reported. The game has also claimed to have 120 million players worldwide. The sequel, The Legend of Mir 3, has a very similar gameplay but has updated graphics, as well as providing larger maps. It has not quite reached the popularity levels of its predecessor and has so far been released in the same countries as Mir 2, as well as in North America.  Gameplay  = Characters = Players have the option of playing one of four professions, with no more than three characters per server. Professions range from Taoist, healers who use magical and melee attacks. This is the support class of mir and not suited to solo game play. Taoists can summon pets to assist in battle, poison targets and heal. Warriors, who are the \\"tanks\\" of Mir use melee attacks and have the highest defense and attack attributes of all classes. Wizards depend on magic and can kill multiple monsters with ease using AoE spells. Wizards have low health and defense against physical damage and are especially weak against higher level warrior magic attacks. Assassins have taken over as the primary melee damage dealing class but have much weaker defense attributes than warriors. Conversely this instead of undermining the warrior class, has strengthened its position and clarified its role as the 'tank'. = PK/PVP = Players are allowed to attack and kill other players ingame for any given reason, though it is generally frowned upon. Once a player has killed another player they are labeled with either yellow or later, red, that informs other players that they have killed somebody recently. Red players are not allowed in most cities and are generally ignored by NPC's. Red players are also fair game to other players, a punishment for their PK status. Another punishment is the chance of having one's weapon cursed by killing another player. Curses cause weapons to deal less of a melee blow. Increased number of curses will render a weapon useless. While attacking another player, the attacker will be labeled with a Brown player name. Any other player can attack and kill the offending player without accumulating PK points. =Point System= Players are labeled with a PK status after successfully killing another player. Each kill is considered 100 PK points. One point is removed every minute. Following the point system * 0-99 Points - The player continues to have a white character name, even though the character still has PK points. * 100-199 Points - The player's name will turn yellow, a symbol that the player has killed somebody recently. * 200 and above - The player's name will be red, showing that the player has killed at least Two people. While red the player can be killed without any ill effect to the attacking player. Red players will lose almost all of their bag when dying. Some players joined guilds specific to player killing, resulting in characters that could spend months if not years waiting for their PK points to expire. Any towns that are guarded by a Guard, Archer Guard or a Town Archer will attack any red named player on sight. This stops any red named players from entering towns, or if they're already in the town it decreases their safe areas dramatically. The damage caused by a guard or archer is considerably high, requiring only a few strikes to take down even the highest level character.  History  = European Mir = The Italian games company Game Network (originally owned by Digital Bros) was responsible for the operation of the European version of the game. Game Network originally had their own satellite television channel (which also has a dedicated show to it, Me in Mir), but it was later closed in 2005 (in Italy) and 2006 (in UK) due to lack of funding. January 5, 2006 - Phoenix server player gwyl is the first in Europe to reach the level 50 milestone and has a statue of his character erected in game In the 2007 yearly review and the September quarterly review, Digital Bros made it clear that they not only intended to replace The Legend of Mir 2 but also another MMORPG service they provided, the Myth of Soma. Digital Bros cited declining subscription revenues (from ‚Ç¨178,000 the previous year, to just ‚Ç¨32,000) as the reason. Microsoft Word - Relazione trimestrale consolidata in inglese al 30 settembre 2007 Gruppo Digital Bros.doc On January 2009 GNOnline released a statement on their website stating that the Legend of Mir 2, Legend of Mir 3, and the Myth of Soma would all be closing at the end of March that year.

It also went by the name Melos Quartett Stuttgart, partly to distinguish itself from the equally prominent chamber group the Melos Ensemble of London.  Origins and activities  Melos Quartett Stuttgart was founded in October 1965 by four young members of well-known German chamber orchestras. The name Melos, an ancient Greek word for the singing, and the root of the word melody, was suggested by the combination of the names Melcher and Voss, to indicate their purpose as distinct individuals seeking musical harmony together.Information in this section is drawn from Ursula von Rauchhaupt, 'Melos Quartett Stuttgart', in Franz Schubert, Die Streichquartette (Polydor International GmbH, 1975, DGG Discs 2563 425‚Äì431), Insert. Leader Melcher of Hamburg studied with Erich R√∂hn and with both Pina Carmirelli and Arrigo Pelliccia of the Boccherini Quintet in Rome. He won the International Chamber Music Competition in Venice in 1962 and became concertmaster of the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra the next year.This detail is from the article by Joseph Stevenson, in Allmusic. The Voss brothers are Rhinelanders. They studied with Sandor V√©gh, and Hermann continued as a pupil of Ulrich Koch, becoming solo violist of the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra. Cellist Buck is a Swabian who studied in D√ºsseldorf and Freiburg and with Ludwig Hoelscher in Stuttgart. Gerhard Voss and Buck were members of the W√ºrttemberg Chamber Orchestra. In 1966 the group gave its first recital, won a prize in the Villa-Lobos-Quartet competition in Rio de Janeiro, represented West Germany at the World Congress of Jeuness Musicale in Paris, and, most influentially for their future success, won the Prix am√©ricain as the best quartet at the Geneva International Congress of Musical Performance. Then, giving up their orchestral positions to concentrate solely on the Quartet, they began touring in 1967 and in 1968 performed in seven European countries. In 1969 they gave 105 concerts throughout the world, and had their first television appearance. Contract with Deutsche Grammophon In 1969 the group signed a five-year contract with the D.G.G. record company, and spent 25 days that year making recordings for radio and commercial release. They obtained the first prize of the String Quartet Foundation sponsored by German industry in 1970, and in 1972 they entered into a further contract with D.G.G. for complete recordings of the Schubert and Cherubini string quartets. After this they undertook tours around the world, in North and South America, Africa,Melos quartet 1972, during an acclaimed tour of Southern Africa all European countries, the Near East and Far East, getting as far as Novosibirsk in Russia. They became the first West German musicians to play in Volgograd (Stalingrad), in 1973, in concerts commemorating the events of 1943. By 1975, when the Schubert integral recordings were completed and issued, the Quartet also held a teaching post at the Stuttgart School of Music. By 1975 the group had built up a repertoire of 120 works, including the complete Beethoven, Schubert, Cherubini and Bart√≥k quartets, and works by Haydn, Mozart, Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Pfitzner, Verdi, Donizetti, Debussy, Smetana, Kod√°ly, Jan√°ƒçek, Hindemith, Alban Berg, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Milko Kelemen, Robert Wittinger and Josef Maria Horv√°th. They made a conscious decision to have a wide-ranging repertoire in order to avoid getting stuck to any particular period. For most of the Schubert recordings the instruments were a cello by Francesco Ruggieri (1682), a viola by Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi (18th century), first violin by Domenico Montagnana (1731) and second violin by Carlo Annibale Tononi (18th century). They were planning a farewell tour in 2005, when Wilhelm Melcher, the first violinist died unexpectedly just before his 65th birthday. Among others, the Quartet collaborated with Arthur Rubinstein, Mstislav Rostropovich, Georg Solti, Narciso Yepes, Piero Farulli and Dietrich Fischer- Dieskau. Members The membership was unusually stable: * Wilhelm Melcher (1940‚Äì2005), violin I * Gerhard Voss (b.1939), from 1965 to 1993 violin II * Ida Bieler (b.1958), from 1993 to 2005 violin II * Hermann Voss (b.1934), viola * Peter Buck (b.1937), cello Recordings They recorded a performance of the Schubert String Quintet with Mstislav Rostropovich as the second cellist on the Deutsche Grammophon label. They recorded a 3-CD set of Mozart's Haydn-Quartette, the complete Mendelssohn, Luigi Cherubini and Schubert String Quartets and the complete Beethoven Quartet Cycle for their 25th Anniversary as a Limited Edition Set for DGG label.

The cars' primary marketing focus is on customization, and they are available in a variety of body styles and types traditionally favored by tuners. Fall 2005 saw the introduction of a new model line dubbed \\"Evolution\\" which also features a line of trucks. The cars are distributed by RadioShack in the United States, by Hobby Products International (HPI Racing) in Japan and by Carson Modellsport (Subdivision of Tamiya Germany) in Europe. Nissan Skyline with available body kit. Models =Generation 1= The original, first- generation XMODS were released in the Fall of 2003, featuring semi- proportional steering and modular construction enabling parts to be swapped. Eleven body styles have been released (one exclusive to Europe and Asia). Hobby Products International continues to distribute the generation 1 car, though RadioShack has discontinued the line in the United States. For the U.S. models, each car comes with a mini-magazine (Super Street for the Japanese models and Hot Rod for the American models), featuring write-ups on selected models and upgrade accessories. 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V.spec * Yellow or Black; Blue version available only in Europe and Asia through HPI.HPI - Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 Silver version available only in Germany on Evolution chassis. 1997 Toyota Supra * Red or White 2000 Honda Civic Si Coupe * Blue or Black 2003 Honda Integra/Acura RSX * Silver black 2004 Honda/Acura NSX * Yellow; White version available only in Europe and Asia through HPI.HPI - Honda NSX 2004 Nissan 350Z * Copper; Silver version available only in Europe and Asia through HPI.HPI - Nissan Fairlady Z Blue version available only in Germany on Evolution chassis. 2003 Chevrolet Corvette C5 * Silver 1967 Chevrolet Camaro * Red; Orange version available only in Germany on Evolution chassis. 1965 Ford Mustang coupe * Light Blue; Dark Blue available only in Germany on Evolution chassis. 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX STI * Blue; White, Orange HPI and Yellow Fujitsubo Racing Colors version available only in Europe and Asia through HPIHPI - Subaru Impreza WRX STI (white)HPI - Subaru Impreza WRX STI (HPI Racing)HPI - Subaru Impreza WRX STI (Fujitsubo Racing) 2004 Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren * Silver; available only in Europe and Asia through HPI.HPI - Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren In addition to body kits for the models above, other body shells were available separately.

They had substantial construction differences from the previous model and are available with either a car or truck chassis. The electronics were vastly improved, with one main board compared to two separate pieces in the generation 1 version. The motor was mounted transversely in contrast to generation 1's longitudinal layout. While the generation 1 chassis had a separate battery housing (each holding two AAA batteries) on each side, the Evolution chassis had one battery housing (holding four AAA batteries) at the bottom. This series was discontinued in the U.S. by RadioShack in mid-2007. It was possible to swap bodies and most parts between the Evolution and generation 1 cars. Some models sold outside the U.S. by HPI featured repainted generation 1 bodies. Like the previous generation models, each XMODS Evolution car came with a Super Street (Japanese models) or Hot Rod (American models) mini-magazine. Truck models had a Truckin' mini-magazine. 1967 Pontiac Firebird * Purple 2004 Hummer H2 * Black 2004 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII * Graphite Gray 2005 Ford Mustang * Dark Blue 2005 Nissan Skyline V35/Infiniti G35 * Red 2005 Ford F-150 * Orange 2006 Ford Mustang * Dark Blue 2006 Scion tC * Silver 2006 Nissan Titan * Red In addition to body kits for the models above, A blue Ford F-150 body shell was available separately for the truck series. It came with body kits, controller steering wheel and compatible drive shafts and chassis extension parts. Also, Yellow and Red Hummer H2 bodies were available through Carson in Germany. These had body color bumpers. =XMODS Evolution Transformers= Stock Xmods based on Transformer's Barricade In June 2007, RadioShack released two XMODS Evolution models to coincide with the release of the film Transformers. Unlike other XMODS, which come in reusable plastic cases, these models came in standard boxes. Special body and light kits were available for these models. RadioShack stores were told not to sell them during a period in January due to a defect in the chassis. Under pressure, the chassis will crack and eventually break.

Currents differences of the XMODS chassis are: * Crystals have been removed and soldered onto the electronics board and inside the controller. Each car has one of two dedicated channels (out of a total of 10 different channels). * Foam inserts in XMODS plastic box have been replaced with plastic similar to holding body kit pieces. * Decals include flames and XMODS stickers. No magazine is included. * Rubber is used to protect parts of the motor * Less wheel wobble, a concern with older XMODS Evolution models. * Rear A-Arms and motor cradle have been reinforced. * The Nissan GT-R has rubber side mirrors, similar to the ones on the Bumblebee Camaro XMODS. * There are no body kit options for any of the cars. The bumpers and spoiler are molded onto the body of all of the cars. =XMODS Generation 3= In fall 2013 RadioShack released a new XMOD with two brand new chassis designs, touring and buggy. The new models are 1:24 in scale as opposed to the previous generations' 1:28 and feature generic bodies. New features include a 2.4 GHz radio, a lithium ion upgrade, and staggered tires. Two other bodies are also available separately, one in a set with lights, and the other in a set with a \\"nitrous boost\\" ultracapacitor that allows a 3-5 second speed boost when a button on the controller is pressed. The other modifications available are extra tires, a high speed rear end and rear end with a faster motor, and an all wheel drive upgrade. This new generation of Xmods did not have licensing from any automotive maker and therefore featured generic bodies. As of 2015, Xmods have once again been discontinued and RadioShack does not have any plans to reintroduce the Xmods line. =XMODS Micro RC= Chevrolet Camaro SS Chevrolet Corvette RadioShack relaunched the ZipZaps Micro RC line under the XMODS banner on October 2008. Aside from the new labels that bear the XMODS Micro RC logo, the packaging is similar to the ZipZaps line. All parts, (motors, wheel covers, bodies, etc.) are backwards and forwards compatible between Zipzaps and XMODS Micro, with the exception of the 2009 models, which have one-piece wheels that do not allow the swapping of wheel covers. However, all other ZipZap and XMODS Micro parts will fit on the 2009 chassis. The cars use the traditional box-type controller, as opposed to the gun-type controller of the ZipZaps SE line. Current models include the following: 1959 Chevrolet CorvetteXMODS Micro RC - 1959 Chevrolet Corvette *Red 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SSXMODS Micro RC - 1967 Chevrolet Camaro SS *Blue 2009 Nissan GT-R *Silver 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X *Red Modifications Nissan Titan Xmods with a servo modification XMODS can be extensively modified using parts supplied by RadioShack and other aftermarket vendors. The starter kits advertise the ability to change the motor, wheels, tires, trim kit, springs/shocks, and bearings (From nylon bushings to steel bearings), add lighting kits, and swap the crystal to allow the cars to operate on multiple frequencies. (Note: The crystal has been discontinued.) Tutorials for modifications are also available on various XMODS forum sites. In Japan, HPI distributes XMODS, in Europe distributed by CARSON Modellsport, with the cars having the same colors as those offered in the U.S. by RadioShack, but also some exclusive body colors and body tops not available to the US market. Even though each model has a different body, all models in a particular line share the same or similar chassis. The most notable difference in the chassis is its length relative to its body top. You can also add motor upgrades onto them for faster speeds. While using non-RadioShack upgrades, it is possible to achieve up to and over 40 MPH. Some people have used servo motors in their XMODS trucks to achieve higher torque, resulting in easier crawling, but with a very limited top speed. People have modified the electronics by using hobby grade electronics, improving the speed, range, and smoothness of the servo in XMODS.

Contemporaries, such as Adrian Willaert (as quoted by the renowned Venetian theorist Zarlino) grouped him with Josquin, Ockeghem, and Jean Mouton as among the finest composers of the time. Compared with those others, however, little of his output has survived. Life Little is known for certain about his life, and there are two principal theories regarding where he lived and worked. The first is that he was associated with the French royal court, for he wrote several motets for official occasions (such as the coronation of King Francis I in 1515); this would have put him there at the same time as Jean Mouton and just after Antoine de F√©vin. In addition, one document describes him as a priest of the Meaux diocese, and also associates him with the cathedral in Tours; it also names him as a singer in the royal chapel in 1517‚Äì1518. A second theory is that he was associated with a group of composers active at Cambrai, since his music appears in manuscripts there. Possibly both theories are correct, and he was active in Paris in the first decades of the 16th century, and at Cambrai later. Music and influence Gascongne wrote masses, motets and chansons. Nine masses have been attributed to him, but not all survive complete. Of his motets, two are settings of the Magnificat. The chansons were famous, and Gascongne has been called the inventor, along with Antoine de F√©vin, of the Parisian chanson rustique . Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian school, also held Gascongne in high regard, stating that he was on the level of Josquin, Ockeghem, and his own teacher Jean Mouton. Most of his sacred music is for four a cappella voices; he uses as source material chansons by Pierre de la Rue, Jean Mouton and Josquin des Prez. His chansons are mostly for three voices, but there are numerous works which are attributed to him in one source but to another composer in other sources (Mouton is a common competitor for attribution). Stylistically his music is typical of French music of the early 16th century, with smooth, balanced polyphony and pervasive imitation.

The core was formed by the French composer Maurice Ravel, the Spanish pianist Ricardo Vi√±es and the writer and critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi. The group was private but never formal, and the wider membership was fluid; over 20 unofficial members would attend meetings of Les Apaches until it came to an end during World War One. During their active years, Les Apaches met weekly. The meetings were a chance for the members to perform and show new works or ideas to a small group, discuss contemporary artistic interests and collaborate.  Origins  In the early 20th century the term Les Apaches was used to describe European street gangs who were of intense interest to the French media at the time. Supposedly, the term was adopted by the diverse circle of artists after a newspaper seller mockingly called \\"attention! Les Apaches\\" as members of the group were returning from the premiere of Claude Debussy's opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande, a work they praised and rallied around. It is possible that this was an ironic insult or a reference to their modernist artistic output. They found the name amusing, especially as they saw art as being at odds with conservative tastes. The precise beginnings of the group are unclear. Many of the regular members were approximate contemporaries, most had met previously and some had been friends for over a decade; four members had been taught by the French composer Gabriel Faur√© and it is likely that some of the other artists had met at the √âcole des beaux-arts or in Salon exhibitions. Throughout 1901, √âmile Vuillermoz hosted regular musical events at his home, and members had gathered at events such as the premiere of Ravel's Jeux d'eau - by the time the group was calling itself Les Apaches there was already a circle of artists who met regularly.  Active years  The first theme of Borodin's second symphony (whistled) From around 1903, the group met each Saturday. For several years, the meetings usually took place in the city studio of the painter Paul Sordes (dubbed 'Ravel with a palette'), a neighbor of the composer Claude Debussy.They later moved to a property that the French composer Maurice Delage rented. Ravel suggested that they adopt the first melody of Borodin's 2nd Symphony as their theme, an idea with which they all agreed. To enter Sordes' apartment or attract the attention of other Apaches after concerts, the member would have to whistle the first few bars of the music; Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade was the initial choice, although it was deemed too difficult to whistle. Ricardo Vi√±es in 1901 Many in the group were amateurs and enthusiasts of the arts from which they did not make a living, and so the members were not limited to one artistic faction within Les Apaches. The meetings were lively, and would often last until the early hours of the morning; they would discuss art, argue about contemporary issues, perform music for each other (Vi√±es being the favoured pianist), play duets together, read poetry, drink coffee and smoke. Symbolism, Javanese music, Russian composers, Edgar Allan Poe, St√©phane Mallarm√© and Paul Cezanne were all topics that fascinated Les Apaches. The music of Debussy was a particular passion. Ideas and fragments of larger unfinished works would often be performed or shown at the meetings; this mingling of ideas would influence several Apaches and lead to various artistic collaborations. The meetings of the group were vibrant occasions, and when other neighbors complained about the noise so late at night, the group began meeting in a more isolated hut rented by Delage, which they called their 'wigwam'. Outside of the meetings, the members would support each other; Vi√±es premiered works by the composers, the critics would encourage new music, and the poets would collaborate with the musicians to set words to music. The wider membership of the group was always shifting. The group (or as they called themselves, 'the band') attracted many members during its existence, some who would meet with the group occasionally, and others whose association with Les Apaches was brief. Despite this somewhat fluid nature of Les Apaches, the group was highly exclusive in other ways; women were strictly forbidden.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01zh1kf Due to the nature of the group, many of the members became close. Ravel, who dedicated each movement of Miroirs to a member of Les Apaches, used the French familiar form tu with only three friends outside his close family - all of them were part of Les Apaches. There is speculation that the one romantic relationship in Ravel's life was with the poet and fellow apache L√©on-Paul Fargue. In 1910, the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky became a member of Les Apaches. According to Stravinsky‚Äôs letters, he frequently visited Paris, staying at the home of his closest friend in the city, Maurice Delage, who helped him deliver manuscripts and set up interviews with the press. In a letter to the apache composer Florent Schmitt, Stravinsky noted that for a time he only listened to the music of Ravel, Schmitt, and Debussy. Although some of the members remained friends, the meetings petered out during World War I and eventually stopped altogether.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p01cc5pn = Debussy and Les Apaches = Claude Debussy in 1908 Contrary to popular belief, Claude Debussy was never part of Les Apaches.http://www.jstor.com/stable/23358736 \\"Debussy the man, his music, and his legacy: an overview of current research\\", Notes, December 2012, p. 201 However, the music of Debussy was of particular importance within Les Apaches, who all greatly admired his compositions, supporting them when they received unfavourable reviews. Pell√©as et M√©lisande was a work they openly admired despite the mixed critical reception. Ravel was a particular fan, attending every one of the opera's performances in its first run - a total of fourteen. Debussy's music also featured in the meetings held by Les Apaches. Ravel had made transcriptions of Debussy's Nocturnes and his Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune for two pianos and piano duet respectively, compositions praised by fellow Apaches. Although Debussy was not close with any one of the Apaches, he was acquainted with several members. The most notable relationship Debussy had with an Apache was Vi√±es, with whom Debussy had a professional relationship for several years. Vi√±es (a pianist Debussy admired) regularly premiered Debussy works and, during his regular meetings with Debussy, Vi√±es would perform works by Ravel for him. Through Vi√±es, Les Apaches were indirectly linked with Debussy. Ravel was often compared with Debussy, and the followers of the composers began to form rough factions; those who supported the younger Ravel, and those who defended Debussy. Similarities in the music of the two composers, as well as the association through Vi√±es, lead to accusations of plagiarism by Ravel. Les Apaches had always been avid supporters of Debussy, although made a point of defending Ravel when it was claimed that he had imitated Debussy.

History and development * 1910: Shankar Abaji Bhise (pronounced sunker bisey), an Indian inventor, who was dying in Paris, France, of a severe malarial infection was treated with a crude, thick, black liquid, used as a household remedy for fevers, made out of seaweed. He made a full recovery. * 1913‚Äì1931: Bhise researches the seaweed liquid, and starts producing and selling it in England and later in the U.S, naming it Beslin (Best Liquid Iodine). Bhise goes into partnership with Laboratoire Durveaux. * 1931: Bhise goes to Virginia and receives channelled \\"readings\\" (readings #358-1 & -2) by American mystic Edgar Cayce about making his product better. It involved treating the iodine by a specific electrical charging process that was outlined in detail. * 1932: Bhise forms Atomidine Company after taking Cayce's term \\"atomic iodine\\" and creating a brand from it using iodine from seaweeds in saline solution instead of elemental iodine in alcohol, which was not the instructions Cayce gave. Bhise tried making it according to Cayce's instruction for Electrified Atomidine in alcohol as a tincture & succeeded but never marketed it (likely because of cost, was during great depression). * 1935‚Äì1974: Shankar Bhise dies and his son, Harold, ran the company until 1948, with Schieffelin and Company of New York manufacturing the Atomidine products. In 1949 The Company was turned over to Dr. Bhise‚Äôs son-in-law. In early 1974, the Heritage Store of Virginia Beach, Virginia acquired the company, manufacturing and selling Atomidine. * Late 1990s: A Cayce researcher by the name of Phillip \\"Phil\\" Thomas, experimented with a 1% tincture of iodine for over a decade, and achieves detoxified Iodine Cayce reading #358-2 process; Iodine molecule energized. * 2004: John Brookshire, a follower of Cayce's teachings since the 1970s, an american aerospace engineer, modernizes the process and formulates nascent iodine in consumable form 1% Tincture of Iodine, Cayce reading #358-1 process. Diatomic bond is broken and atom is highly energized to nascent state in electromagnetic field. The discovery was made in the struggle to assist his good friend, a missionary in Africa, with a treatment for drug resistant malaria. The original purpose was to supply a product that could be used by the missionary to treat malaria, but as he shared his iodine, both on the mission field and with friends at home in the US, word spread of its encouraging results in a variety of applications. This led to the need to produce more and more product and to accept payment for the iodine, and started the Magnascent company. Brookshire donates tinctures to missionaries in Zambia and doctors in India on a regular basis. * 2011: Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment acknowledges John Brookshire's 2004 nascent iodine formula. Edgar Cayce The preparation was first conceived in 1931 by American Christian mystic Edgar Cayce in two channelled \\"readings\\" for an Indian inventor by the name of Shankar Bhise who inquired about how to improve an iodine medicine. Cayce regarded this specially formulated \\"atomic\\" iodine as far easier to assimilate than other forms. Cayce recommended this atomic iodine or Atomidine as a therapeutic measure, in over 600 \\"readings\\". Extracts from some of his readings: \\"This will not only be a curative property, but a preventative ‚Ä¶ especially for any form of disorder in glands or tissue of body\\" (358-2), and \\"with the use of this product, a more equal balance is to be gained and maintained in the system‚Äîbut used properly!\\" (358-1) Reiterated throughout this body of information is its purpose, when taken orally, as a gland purifier and cleanser, especially affecting the thyroid, thymus, adrenals, and other ductless glands, and stimulating \\"the circulation through lungs, heart, liver and kidneys.\\" (3535-1) This reaction upon the glands would create ‚Äúperfect coordination between the glandular forces of the body‚Äù (1933-1) and \\"build strength to the whole anatomical condition of the body.\\" (1475-1) Another reading stated that \\"most glands function as machinery would under oil. The iodine being the oil for the gland, see?\\" (294-130). (the numbers that follow each quote from the readings refer to the reading filing code in the A.R.E. files) Manufacture Cayce gave two separate readings for Shankar Bhise and gave him directions with two different manufacturing methods: * Reading #358-2: In a three gallon bath, 16 ounces of iodine (a 1% solution in alcohol, commonly referred to as a tincture) is bathed for five minutes in an electromagnetic field of 10 amps of resistance. This method produces the weaker less active \\"Detoxified\\" Iodine w /added energy but the % of monoatomic iodine is much less. It allegedly was born out of Cayce's frustration from Bisey's complaints that the 358-1 took too much time & money. This method is much faster and cheaper, using weak electromagnetic fields and much shorter exposure times with no heat build up. * Reading # 358-1: In a one gallon bath, just one ounce of iodine (a 1% solution in alcohol) is bathed for 15 to 20 minutes in an electromagnetic field with a current of 30 amperes. This method produces the stronger more active atomic State (monoatomic = 1 molecule) using a stronger electromagnetic field and longer exposure times, which needed stabilizing it after cooling. It yields smaller amounts of finished product per batch, but is significantly more active than the plain 358-2 method. This second method, it was theorized, achieves a nascent state of iodine by breaking the diatomic bond (the bond between two molecules) and elevating the energy of the iodine atom. Today, Cayce's prescribed \\"Atomic iodine\\" is made in different ways by different manufacturers, and is generally named nascent iodine, atomic iodine or detoxified iodine, each with different interpretations of the Edgar Cayce readings in which it was first recommended. Some manufacturers mix nascent iodine with other supplements (such as herbs) in the bottle, which would bond when this free form of iodide is exposed to a positively charged ion, such as sodium or potassium, as it would be in a liquid supplement, it will bind with these to form sodium iodide or potassium iodide, basically nullifying its nascent state. Trademark The name Atomidine is an unregistered trademark of The Heritage Store (was a registered trademark between 2001 and 2008). Their formula contains iodine in the form of iodine trichloride and aqueous solution, which is treated with several herbal compounds.Atomidine, Association for Research and Enlightenment The name Atomic Iodine is an unegistered trademark of Baar Products, Inc. Baar is the official Supplier of A.R.E.'s Edgar Cayce Health Care. Baar Atomic Iodine is made with 1% iodine- trichloride in aqueous solution, with an added proprietary blend of herbs. The name Detoxadine is a registered trademark of Global Healing Center. Their formula is made of elemental iodine in glycerin aqueous solution. They state \\"Historically, nascent iodine has been made using electricity to break iodine‚Äôs diatomic bond and create a single, highly energized atom. However, it is difficult to use this method on the scale necessary to produce sufficient quantities\\". They use nanoemulsion technology (smaller drops) for their Iodine formula. Alex Jones's Infowars Life brand uses the same formula. The name Magnascent is a registered trademark of John Brookshire, owner of the 2004 nascent iodine patent. LL Magnetic Clay Nascent Iodine is also based on his patent. Research Other patented applications of nascent iodine are produced chemically or through electrolytic means or by laser, and their half- life is very short and none of them is a consumable form of nascent iodine. While the improvement recommended by Cayce is produced electromagnetically and is consumable. The consumable nascent iodine hypothesis is that splitting of the diatomic bond through homolytic cleavage then each atom becomes paramagnetic in nature, able to take magnetic charging. If this charge is sufficient to keep the atom from entering the nascent state until the energy is dissipated through electromagnetic relaxation, such as water, then there is a period of activation or usefulness to the body, of two or three hours. Brookshire patented nascent iodine tincture formulated according to Cayce's reading #358-1, showed efficacy both as a therapeutic and chemoprophylaxis agent against malaria in a 2012 clinical trial. Criticism In 1929 the FDA Bureau of Chemistry stated on Atomidine advertised health claims \\"As far as our records go, all of these claims are without a scintilla of printed scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that Atomidine is superior or even the equal to tincture of iodine...\\". Biologist Wojciech Rychlik in an article for orthomolecular.org about iodine supplementation, wrote: > The diatomic form of elemental iodine I2, has no electrical charge. > Monoatomic iodine also has no electrical charge, but is unstable and highly > reactive (free radical, labeled as an I with a dot, I* ).

Tredegar supplied about half the artillery used by the Confederate States Army, as well as the iron plating for CSS Virginia, the first Confederate ironclad warship, which fought in the historic Battle of Hampton Roads in March 1862. The works avoided destruction by troops during the evacuation of the city, and continued production through the mid-20th century. Now classified as a National Historic Landmark District, the site serves as the main building of the American Civil War Museum. The name Tredegar derives from the Welsh industrial town that supplied much of the company's early workforce. History =Founding (1836‚Äì1841)= Death of Rhys Davies from stab wound 1838 In 1836, a group of Richmond businessmen and industrialists led by Francis B. Deane, Jr. set about to capitalize on the growing railroad boom in the United States. The group hired Rhys Davies, then a young engineer, to construct a new facility, brought a number of his fellow iron workers from Tredegar, Wales, to construct the furnaces and rolling mills. The foundry was named in honor of the town of Tredegar, where iron works of the same name were constructed in the early 19th century. The new works opened in 1837, yet the Panic of 1837 and accompanying downturn resulted in hardship for the new company. Davies died in Richmond in September 1838 from stab wounds sustained in a fight with a workman and was buried on Belle Isle in the James River. =Management under Joseph Reid Anderson (1841 ‚Äì Civil War)= Joseph Reid Anderson in Confederate officer's uniform In 1841, the owners turned management over to a 28-year-old civil engineer named Joseph Reid Anderson who proved to be an able manager. Anderson acquired ownership of the foundry in 1848, after two years of leasing the works, and was soon doing work for the United States government. Anderson began introducing slave labor to cut production costs. By the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, half of the 900 workers were slaves, including many in skilled positions. By 1860, Anderson's father-in-law Dr. Robert Archer had joined the business and Tredegar became a leading iron producer in the country. The commissioning of 900 miles of railroad track in Virginia, largely financed by the Virginia Board of Public Works between 1846 and 1853, offered a further market in steam locomotives and rail stock. One of those attributed with starting the Tredegar Locomotive Works with John Souther was Zerah Colburn, the well-known locomotive engineer and journalist. The company produced about 70 steam locomotives between 1850 and 1860. From 1852 to 1854, John Souther also managed the locomotive shop at Tredegar. Its locomotive production work is sometimes listed with combinations of the names Anderson, Souther, Delaney, and Pickering. Tredegar also produced the steam propulsion plants for the USS Roanoke (1855) and the USS Colorado (1856). Prior to the Civil War, industry expanded at the Tredegar site under Anderson's direction to include a new flour mill on land leased to Lewis D. Crenshaw and a stove works on land leased to A.J. Bowers and Asa Snyder.\\"A Guide to the Tredegar Iron Works Records, 1801-1957\\" By 1860, Crenshaw and Co. had established the Crenshaw Woolen Mill on adjoining land they owned. This enterprise employed more than 50 people.The Richmond Dispatch, October 31, 1860, p. 1, c. 6. The Crenshaw Woolen Mill became \\"the principal source of supply for the [Confederate] Army's requirements of uniform material\\" during the first half of the Civil War.\\"Captain William G[raves] Crenshaw, C.S.A., The War Years,\\" William G. Crenshaw III, Virginia State Library, Richmond, VA, Archives #25261. A May 16, 1863 fire on the Tredegar/Crenshaw site damaged the mill, which was not rebuilt, and Tredegar purchased the land from Crenshaw and Co. by 1863.Richmond Dispatch, Saturday Morning, May 16, 1863 , p. 1.The Richmond Sentinel, December 17, 1863, p. 1, c. 2. American Civil War Trunnion from a bronze cannon stamped \\"J R A & CO, T F\\" (J.R. Anderson & Company, Tredegar Foundry) made at the Tredegar Iron Works By 1860, the Tredegar Iron Works was the largest of its kind in the South, a fact that played a significant role in the decision to relocate the capital of the Confederacy from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond in May 1861. Tredegar supplied high- quality munitions to the Confederacy during the war. Its wartime production included the iron plating for the first Confederate ironclad warship, the CSS Virginia which fought in the historic Battle of Hampton Roads in ; credit for approximately 1,100 artillery pieces during the war, about half of the South's total domestic production of artillery between the war years of 1861‚Äì1865, including the development of the Brooke rifle; a giant rail-mounted siege cannon. The company also manufactured railroad steam locomotives in the same period. As a result of his difficulties competing with Northern industries due to his higher labor and raw material costs, Anderson was a strong supporter of southern secession and became a Brigadier General in the Confederate Army as the war broke out. He was wounded at Glendale during the Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula Campaign in 1862 and served in the Ordnance Department for the duration of the Civil War. As the war continued with more and more men conscripted into the Confederate armies, Tredegar experienced a lack of skilled laborers. Scarce supplies of metal also hurt the company's manufacturing abilities during the war and as the conflict progressed it was noticed that Tredegar's products were beginning to lose quality as well as quantity. Even in the summer of 1861, soon after the beginning of the Civil War, metal was so scarce that the iron works failed to produce a single piece of artillery for an entire month. During the evacuation of Richmond by the Confederates on the night of April 2‚Äì3, 1865, the retreating troops were under orders to burn munitions dumps and industrial warehouses that would have been valuable to the North. Anderson reportedly paid over 50 armed guards to protect the facility from arsonists. As a result, the Tredegar Iron Works is one of few Civil War-era buildings that survived the burning of Richmond. =After the Civil War= At the outset of hostilities, Anderson had wisely secured Tredegar assets overseas for the duration of the Civil War and, therefore, was able to restore his business when the Confederate currency collapsed. He petitioned U.S. President Andrew Johnson for a pardon for himself and Tredegar and was back in business before the end of 1865, regaining full ownership in 1867. That same year, Tredegar incorporated with a stock of $1,000,000. Francis Thomas Glasgow, the father of Virginia writer and suffragist Ellen Glasgow, was a manager at Tredegar Iron Works, and Joseph Reid Anderson was her maternal uncle. By 1873, Tredegar Iron Works was employing 1,200 workers and was a profitable business. However, the Panic of 1873 hit the company hard, and as a result of financing difficulties it did not transition to steel, and so faded from national prominence. The neighborhood of Oregon Hill cropped up as a company town-like development. When Joseph Anderson died on a vacation in New Hampshire in 1892, he was succeeded by his son Colonel Archer Anderson. The Tredegar company remained in business throughout the first half of the 20th century, and supplied requirements of the armed forces of the United States during World War I and World War II. In 1957, Anderson's descendants sold the land to Ethyl Corporation, who began restoration of some of the surviving structures. Preservation as a Civil War museum site and tourist attraction The Pattern Building, now used as the main visitors' center for Richmond National Battlefield Park In the 21st century, the buildings at the Tredegar site have been preserved through development of the site to commemorate the Civil War. The site is also used for various festivals and public events such as the Richmond Folk Festival. The American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar is a separate museum at the former Tredegar Ironworks The Pattern Building is used as the main visitors' center for Richmond National Battlefield Park. The American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar is a separate museum at the former Tredegar Ironworks. =Valentine Riverside= In the 1990s, the Court End-based Valentine Museum opened a second museum site at the Tredegar Ironworks. The focus of the museum experience was industrial history. Interpretive tours to and from the site covered industrial history, African American history, and Civil War history. The venture, however, was short- lived. The \\"Valentine on the James\\" opened on Memorial Day 1994 and closed to the public on Labor Day 1995. =Civil War Visitor Center at Tredegar Iron Works = The main visitor center for Richmond National Battlefield Park opened at the Tredegar Iron Works site in . The Civil War Visitor Center at Tredegar Iron Works is located in the restored pattern building and offers three floors of exhibits, an interactive map table, a film about the Civil War battles around Richmond, a bookstore, and interpretive NPS rangers on site daily to provide programs and to aid visitors.Old Wall at Tredegar =Lincoln statue = Statue of Abraham Lincoln and his son In 2000, the former Tredegar Iron Works facility overlooking the James River near downtown Richmond became the site of the main Visitor's Center of the Richmond National Battlefield Park. Sculptor David Frech of Newburgh, New York, was commissioned by The United States Historical Society of Richmond to commemorate the historic arrival of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad Lincoln and their tour of the burnt-out Union-captured Richmond, Virginia, April 4, 1865, 10 days before his assassination. Funds were raised by the Historical society through donations and the selling of miniature versions of the statue as well as bronzed resin copies.Lincoln Statue To Be Put Up In Richmond The statue, much like the Arthur Ashe Monument, received a wide array of criticism for its placement. Traditionally reserved for statues of key figures of the Confederacy protests were held at the unveiling April 5, 2003, namely by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Robert H. Kline, chairman of the historical society, the Richmond- based nonprofit company that commissioned the statue stated that the statue was for the purpose of reconciliation \\"He came on a mission of peace and reconciliation and I think the statue will serve that purpose for a very long time\\" Opponents of the statue claim that the statue commemorates Lincoln's arrival into Richmond a proud victor. Bragdon Bowling, Virginia division commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, was among the speakers protesting the statues unveiling stating that it represented \\"a slap in the face of a lot of brave men and women who went through four years of unbelievable hell fighting an invasion of Virginia led by President Lincoln.\\" and that \\"As a Southerner, I'm offended. You wouldn't put a statue of Winston Churchill in downtown Berlin, would you? What's next, a statue of Sherman in Atlanta?\\". Other notable protesters include Fred Taylor, president of the Heritage Preservation Association; and Elliott Germain, chairman Virginia League of the South. Dignitaries at the installation ceremony included former governors Douglas Wilder and Gerald L. Baliles, former Mayor of Richmond, then-Lt. Governor, and future Governor Tim Kaine, and then-Mayor of Richmond Rudy McCollum. The dedication ceremony was buzzed by a plane trailing a banner proclaiming Sic semper tyrannis, which is not only Virginia's motto (meaning \\"Thus always to tyrants\\"), but also what John Wilkes Booth, according to his diary, called out while assassinating Lincoln. The statue is made of a bronze cast depicting Lincoln and his son Tad on a bench with Lincoln's arm around his son. The bench was deliberately made long enough so that viewers may sit next to either statue on the bench to take photographs. The words \\"To Bind Up The Nation's Wounds\\" from Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address are carved into granite behind them. =American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar= The idea of another museum on the site was later realized on Saturday, October 7, 2006, The American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar opened to the public. James M. McPherson described the museum as \\"a truly comprehensive exhibit and education center weaving together Union, Confederate, and African-American threads ... much needed for future generations to understand how the Civil War shaped the nation.\\" The Center contains interactive theaters, plasma-screen maps, and artifacts. The museum's exhibits were put together by a team of historians that included James M. McPherson of Princeton, Bill Cooper of Louisiana State University, John Fleming of the Cincinnati Museum Center, Charles Dew of Williams College, David W. Blight of Yale and Emory Thomas at the University of Georgia. In November 2013 the Civil War Center was merged with the Museum of the Confederacy and became the American Civil War Museum in January 2014. In Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory Series of alternate history novels, in which the South wins the Civil War, the Confederate Army's standard rifle is called the Tredegar, produced by what is by then called the Tredegar Steel Works.

The group is best known for launching the career of rapper and producer Zev Love X, who later became MF DOOM. Zev Love X and his younger brother DJ Subroc formed the core of KMD. The group's original third member, Rodan, left before the group signed with Elektra Records; he was replaced with Onyx the Birthstone Kid. History Zev Love X, DJ Subroc and Rodan formed KMD in Long Beach, New York, in 1988. The three were Black Muslims active in the Nuwaubian Nation. KMD began as a graffiti crew, which also practiced breakdance. Onyx the Birthstone Kid soon replaced Rodan, who left the group in order to finish high school. MC Serch, a native of nearby Far Rockaway, met the group at community functions and recruited them for a guest spot on \\"The Gas Face,\\" a single off 3rd Bass' The Cactus Album. The guest appearance caught the attention of A&R; executive Dante Ross, who signed KMD to Elektra Records. KMD released their debut album Mr. Hood in 1991. Its songs focus on racism and black empowerment in a comical manner. Subroc heavily sampled old children's television shows and recordings, including drops of Sesame Street character Bert on the singles \\"Who Me?\\" and \\"Humrush.\\" Skits featuring KMD interacting with \\"Mr. Hood\\" (a series of samples from a language instruction tape) tie the album together. Stimulated Dummies co-produced Mr. Hood; the album also featured fellow Five Percenters, Brand Nubian appearing on \\"Nitty Gritty.\\" The group recorded their follow up, Black Bastards, in 1993. The album was a departure from their lighthearted previous release with songs celebrating sex (\\"Plumskinnz\\"), drugs (\\"Smokin' That S*#%\\", \\"Contact Blitt\\", \\"Suspended Animation\\") and drinking (\\"Sweet Premium Wine\\"). Onyx left the group during the recording sessions. His verse was removed from \\"Plumskinnz\\" (the B-side to the \\"Nitty Gritty\\" single off Mr. Hood), which was included on Black Bastards as two separate tracks, \\"Plumskinnz (Loose Hoe, God & Cupid)\\" (Zev Love X's verse) and \\"Plumskinnz (Oh No I Don'T Believe It!)\\" (Subroc's verse). Zev Love X created the cover art, a Sambo caricature being hanged in a game of hangman. Shortly before Black Bastards scheduled release date Subroc was killed while attempting to cross the 878 Nassau Expressway. Elektra Records dropped KMD later the same week. The album's title and cover art proved too controversial for Elektra's management, who instructed Dante Ross to give Zev Love X the Black Bastards master tapes and $20,000 as incentive to leave the label. The album was heavily bootlegged until it was formally released on Bobbito Garcia's Fondle 'Em Records in 1998. Zev Love X dropped out of the New York hip hop scene until 1997 when he reemerged as MF Doom. On August 16, 2017, MF DOOM premiered the first new KMD track in ten years, \\"True Lightyears\\", on NPR Music. The release also featured Jay Electronica.

It is inspired by and set in the background of the Sannyasi Rebellion in the late 18th century, it is considered one of the most important novels in the history of Bengali and Indian literature. Its importance is heightened by the fact that it became synonymous with the struggle for Indian independence from the British Empire. Its first English publication was titled The Abbey of Bliss (literally Anand=Bliss and Math=Abbey). Vande Mataram, \\"Hail to the Mother\\", first song to represent Bengal - or India, which is almost synonymous at that time as far as nationalism is concerned - as the Motherland was published in this novel. Plot summary The book is set in the years during the famine in Bengal in 1770 CE. It starts with introduction to a couple, Mahendra and Kalyani, who are stuck at their village Padachinha without food and water in the times of famine. They decide to leave their village and move to the next closest city where there is a better chance of survival. During the course of events, the couple gets separated and Kalyani has to run through the forest with her infant to avoid getting caught by robbers. After a long chase, she loses consciousness at the bank of a river. A Hindu ‚ÄúSantana‚Äù( who were not true sanyasis but common people who took the symbol of sanyasis and left their household so as to rebel against tyrannical Muslim rulers) , Jeevanand took the daughter to his home handing her to his sister while he shifted Kalyani to his ashram. The husband, Mahendra, at this point is more inclined towards joining the brotherhood of the monks and serving the Mother Nation. Kalyani wants to help him in attaining his dreams by trying to kill herself, thereby relieving him of worldly duties. At this point, Satyananda joins her but before he can help her, he is arrested by the British soldiers, because other monks were fuelling revolt against the British rule. While being dragged away he spots another monk who is not wearing his distinctive robes and sings, The other monk deciphers the song, rescues Kalyani and the baby, taking them to a rebel monk hideout. Concurrently, Kalyani's husband, Mahendra, is also given shelter by the monks, and they are reunited. The leader of the rebels shows Mahendra the three faces of Bharat-Mata (Mother India) as three goddess idols being worshipped in three consecutive rooms: # What Mother Was ‚Äì An idol of Goddess Jagaddhatri # What Mother Has Become ‚Äì An idol of Goddess Kali # What Mother Will Be ‚Äì An idol of Goddess Durga Gradually, the rebel influence grows and their ranks swell. Emboldened, they shift their headquarters to a small brick fort. The British attack the fort with a large force. The rebels blockade the bridge over the nearby river, but they lack any artillery or military training. In the fighting, the British make a tactical retreat over the bridge. The Sannyasis' undisciplined army, lacking military experience, chases the British into the trap. Once the bridge is full of rebels, British artillery opens fire, inflicting severe casualties. However, some rebels manage to capture some of the cannons, and turn the fire back on to the British lines. The British are forced to fall back, the rebels winning their first battle. The story ends with Mahendra and Kalyani building a home again, with Mahendra continuing to support the rebels. The song Vande Mataram is sung in this novel. Vande Mataram means \\"I bow to thee, Mother\\". It inspired freedom fighters in the 20th century and its first two stanzas became the national song of India after independence.  Characters  *leading role Mahendra: A wealthy Zamindar (landowner), living in Padachihna with his wife (Kalyani) and daughter (Sukumari). They are forced to leave the village to find a new mode of living. Mahendra is initiated to the Anandamath by Guru Satyananda. The Guru orders Mahendra to use his wealth to manufacture ammunition for the Anandamath. *Satyananda: The founder and main Guru of Anandamath, a rebel group to oppose the British rule in India. His disciples are required to renounce their attachments until India is freed. Satyananda was acting upon the orders of his Guru, a mysterious saint, who explains his true motives. The Guru explains Satyananda that Indians need objective knowledge from the British to once more understand the subtle truths of the ancient scriptures. Satyananda goes with his Guru to the Himalayas for penances. *Bhavananda: A brave commander of Anandamath who dies during the battle against the British. *Jivananda: The most accomplished and loyal disciple of Satyananda. He rescues Mahendra's family and reunites them. His wife and lover, Shanti, later becomes the first and only woman to join the Anandamath and fights alongside Jivananda. In the end Jivananda is grievously injured in battle but is revived by Shanti. The young married couple decide to go on a pilgrimage and live as ascetics. *Navinananda a.k.a. Shanti: She is the tomboyish daughter of a Brahmin and is well educated. Shanti was orphaned at a young age and became physically fit and strong. Shanti met Jivananda who married her out of pity as Shanti had no one to take care of her. Jivananda left Shanti as a part of renouncing his attachments and to fight for Anandamath. Shanti is left in the care of Jivananda's married sister. However, Shanti is deeply in love with her husband and cannot bear to live away from him. She disguises herself as a man and joins Anandamath as a freedom fighter. Satyananda tries to forbid her from entering, but he is shocked at Shanti's physical strength when she strings a mighty bow which only he and Jivananda were the only Sannyasins to be able to do so. Satyananda allows Shanti to stay and gives her the name Navinananda. Shanti rescues Kalyani from dacoits. She gathers intelligence from the British and fights in battles alongside her husband. At the end of the battle, at nightfall, Shanti discovers Jivananda's seemingly lifeless body and grieves for him. Satyananda's Guru gives Shanti a herb, with which she revives Jivananda. Shanti suggests Jivananda that they go on a pilgrimage and live together in a forest as ascetics, to which her husband reluctantly agrees. Commentary The plot background was based on the devastating Bengal famine of 1770 under the British Raj and unsuccessful Sannyasi rebellion. Bankim Chandra Chatterjee imagined untrained but disciplined Sannyasi soldiers fighting and beating the experienced English forces. Film adaptation The novel was later adapted into a film, Anand Math in 1952, directed by Hemen Gupta, starring Prithviraj Kapoor, Bharat Bhushan, Pradeep Kumar, Ajit and Geeta Bali. The music was composed by Hemant Kumar, who gave a version of the Vande Mataram sung by Lata Mangeshkar, which became a cult success.Pradeep Kumar Rediff.com.

Founders The founding partners had wide experience in both electronics and music. Cockerell, who was EMS' main equipment designer in its early years, was an electronics engineer and computer programmer. In the mid-1960s Zinovieff had formed the electronic music group Unit Delta Plus with Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Cary was a noted composer and a pioneer in electronic music--he was one of the first people in the UK to work in the musique concrete field and built one of the country's first electronic music studios; he also worked widely in film and TV, composing scores for numerous Ealing Studios and Hammer Films productions, and he is well known for his work on the BBC's Doctor Who, notably on the classic serial The Daleks. VCS 3 Front view of the Synthi (VCS 3) II (DK1 keyboard not shown) The company's first commercial synthesiser, the VCS 3, designed by David Cockerell, was produced in 1969. It was developed in the basement of Zinovieff's house and was nicknamed \\"The Putney\\" after the London suburb where he was living at the time. (renamed from: ) EMS' original aim was to create a versatile monophonic synthesiser that would retail for just ¬£100. While this proved unattainable in practice, the company nevertheless succeeded in manufacturing and selling the VCS3 for just ¬£330, less than its nearest American competitor the Minimoog (which originally retailed for US$1495 when released in 1970) and far cheaper than Moog's modular systems, which cost thousands of dollars. EMS also released the DK1, a velocity sensitive dynamic monophonic keyboard controller for use with VCS3; this included an extra VCO and VCA and retailed for ¬£145. (moved from: - duophonic version of DK1, released in 1971. The DK1 was nicknamed \\"The Cricklewood\\" after the London suburb where Cockerell lived. EMS used to have a R&D; department based over a DIY shop in Cricklewood Lane, Cricklewood, London, so that could have influenced the name of the mechanical keyboard. It is not widely known that EMS electronic equipment was mostly made by another company \\"Hilton Electronics\\" based in Wareham, Dorset. The VCS3 consisted of 3 voltage- controlled oscillators (VCOs), a noise generator, two input amplifiers, ring modulator, voltage-controlled low-pass filter, trapezoid envelope generator, voltage-controlled reverberation, level meter, two output amplifiers thus providing a stereo output, and a joystick providing 'X' and 'Y' modulation control. Matrix plugboard A distinctive design feature of the VCS3 (and later EMS systems) was that, rather than using patch cords to route audio and control signals between modules, Cockerell employed a small matrix plugboard (patchboard) into which the user stuck special conductive pins that connected an input (listed on the X-axis of the matrix) to an output (on the Y-axis). This matrix plugboard gave the VCS3 a high degree of inter-connectivity, comparable to that of much larger modular systems, and far greater than similar small synthesisers like the Minimoog. It was also much easier to examine than the tangle of patch cords used to interconnect other modular systems of the day, such as the Moog modular synthesizer and was many times smaller than the cumbersome Moog patch bays, which used patch cord leads capped with 1/4-inch 'phone' jacks. A live performance version, the VCS4, was built later the same year but was never put into production. It comprised two VCS3s side-by-side with a keyboard, mixer and signal processing in front, all in a single wooden cabinet. Although EMS lost track of the instrument in 1983, it survived and in the United States,, until 2019 when musician Simon Desorgher sold it to the Goldsmiths College, University of London Electronic Music Studios. The company's next project, the Synthi KB1 (1970), designed by Cockerell, also never went into production. It featured the same synthesis modules as the VCS3, but housed in a horizontal box casing, with a 29-note mini-keyboard controller and two small built in speakers. Only one prototype unit was built and this was subsequently sold to the progressive rock group Yes. Synthi 100 EMS Synthi 100 EMS moved into direct competition with Moog in 1971 with the development of its first large-scale modular synthesiser, the \\"Synthi 100\\", which originally retailed for ¬£6,500. This unit was first known as the \\"Digitana\\" another was later dubbed \\"The Delaware\\", after Delaware Rd, Maida Vale, the location of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Mounted in a free- standing console cabinet, the Synthi 100 was the third development level of the original VCS3, being in essence 28 VCS3 units by circuit board count. It was driven by twelve VCOs and eight VCF oscillators. Featured a built-in oscilloscope, two 60 x 60 patchbays, two joystick controllers, dual five- octave velocity-sensitive keyboard controllers and a 10,000 clock event with 6x6bit D/A outputs. e.g. 256 duophonic events (512 CV events) digital sequencer. About 30 units were built by EMS, and these enjoyed wide use in the 1970s and beyond; one model was sold to the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and was used extensively on BBC productions including Doctor Who, Blake's 7 and the original radio version of The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy. The sequencer module of the Synthi 100 was also made available as a separate unit, the Synthi Sequencer 256, which originally sold for ¬£1,100. Synthi A / Synthi AK / Synthi AKS A later-model, with capacitive keyboard In 1971 EMS released a portable version of the VCS3, the EMS Synthi A, originally called the \\"Portabella\\", a pun on London's Portobello Road. Built into a compact Spartanite attach√© case, this unit was even cheaper than the original VCS3 and retailed for just ¬£198. The following year EMS released an expanded version, the Synthi AKS, which retailed for ¬£420 and featured a sequencer and a small keyboard built into the lid. The first 30 AK units featured a black and silver touch pad, a Spin-and-touch random note selector and a resistive touch-sensitive keyboard; these original keyboards proved difficult to use, so they were subsequently replaced with blue capacitive touch-sensitive keyboard with integrated sequencer, and became known as the KS version. The Synthi AKS proved very popular and AKS units owned by Eno, Pink Floyd and Jean-Michel Jarre featured prominently in music by these artists in the early 1970s; one of the best-known appearances of an AKS on record is the track \\"On the Run\\" from Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), and it can be seen being used by Roger Waters and David Gilmour during the recording of the album in footage included in the 1st Director's Cut of Live at Pompeii and in the DSOTM episode of the BBC documentary series Classic Albums, respectively (Gilmour used his to demonstrate the sequence used in the song). EMS synthesisers in music and the media Dick Mills, BBC Radiophonic Workshop at the Roundhouse EMS synthesisers and their London studios were used by many prominent rock and electronic artists including Pink Floyd (Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall), The Who (Won't Get Fooled Again), BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Brian Eno and Roxy Music, Tangerine Dream (all early albums), Hawkwind, Tim Blake, Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk and David Vorhaus (White Noise 2). As noted above, the Synthi 100 \\"Delaware\\" owned by the Radiophonic Workshop was used extensively for BBC radio and television productions in the 1970s. David Gilmour's 'EMS Synthi Hi-Fli' (aka 'The Sound Freak'), purchased 1972, used on The Dark Side of the Moon The EMS Synthi Hi-Fli analog multi effect processor was used extensively by Tony TS Mcphee of The Groundhogs and was used on the album SOLID in 1974. Footage exists of them live at the Marquee Club in London and it is clearly visible on its stand on stage. This footage was broadcast on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1974. In late 2010 Zinovieff put his original Synthi A synthesiser (serial number 4016) up for sale. This instrument, which he believes was the one featured in the \\"Every Picnic Needs a Synthi\\" press advertisement, was fully restored by Robin Wood at EMS. (See also EMS Dr Zinovieff's original Synthi A (Sphere item # 8024) at VEMIA) EMS equipment can be seen in the 1978 British horror film The Shout starring Alan Bates, John Hurt and Susannah York, the equipment featured includes a Synthi Sequencer 256, a Vocoder 2000 and a VCS3, the film is available on DVD (Network 79527630), the equipment was loaned to \\"The Rank Organisation\\" by Dartington College in Devon, and the featured Synthi Sequencer 256 was recently sold on the \\"Vintage Electronic Musical Instrument Auction\\" VEMIA (See also other EMS exhibits at VEMIA) website in April 2011.

It is in the Great Lakes Basin, and is home to a cottage community, including game fishing, a marina and lodges. Geography Kasshabog Lake is located north of the community of Havelock. The lake receives flow from several smaller tributary lakes. The major inflow at the north and outflow at the south is the North River, which flows to Belmont Lake, and then via the Crowe River and Trent River to Lake Ontario. Although the lake has many islands and bays, only MacDonald (Bill's) Bay appeared to be hydrologically separated from the main lake, but it is not. , the lake had 16 permanent residences, 504 cottages, and four cottage rental units. MacDonald Bay has 81 cottages along its shoreline. The unincorporated area and dispersed rural community of Kasshabog Lake is on the west shore. (community) Hydrology The volume of water in MacDonald Bay flushes itself about twice during the year, while the rest of the lake flushes only about once a year. Kasshabog Lake has soft, slightly acidic water with a moderately low amount of apparent colour. The hardness, alkalinity, and conductivity levels indicate the lake is well mixed. Thermal stratification (temperature layers) were found in almost all the bays and monitoring stations. Water clarity was moderately good throughout the lake, and the secchi disk results indicate the lake is mesotrophic, or moderately enriched. Dissolved oxygen distribution throughout the lake showed a gradual decline with increasing depth, probably due to the decomposition of organic matter in the bottom waters. No significant accumulations of nutrients in the bottom waters was found at any of the monitoring stations. The density and composition of the phytoplankton (microscopic water plants) indicated an \\"unenriched\\" lake condition. The density and composition of the zookplankton (microscopic animals) indicated \\"moderately enriched\\" lake conditions. Sportfish The most popular sportfish of Kasshabog lake are Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Smallmouth Bass. The lake also contains Rock Bass, Perch, and Walleye (Pickerel). Tornado There was a tornado in the summer of 2002, it was most likely anEF0 or EF1. There was tree damage and a few houses damaged.  Fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana)  Fanwort is an aquatic perennial herbaceous plant and is considered invasive. The first verified report of an established population of fanwort in Ontario was made in the summer of 1991 in the North River, immediately downstream of Kasshabog Lake. It is the only reported established population of this plant in Canada. Fanwort is a popular aquarium plant and was likely introduced to the lake by dumping aquarium remains into the lake. Pollution from Unimin Ltd. on Kasshabog Lake In August 2012, the Medical Officer of Health of Peterborough County issued a health advisory to the residents of Kasshabog Lake and Bottle Lake. For details see www.pcchu.ca.To the Residents of Bottle Lake and Kasshabog Lake, Peterborough County City Health Unit, undated September 4, 2012 In February 2013 the Ministry of the Environment released an exhaustive study on the air quality Impacts of Unimin Ltd. on Kasshabog Lake. The report concludes that: \\"Unimin is the source of contaminants that are being released to the atmosphere in an amount and manner that is causing the following adverse effects, contrary to the general provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, RSO 1990 (EPA), Section 14: a)impairment of the quality of the natural environment for any use that can be made of it, b) damage to property, c)harm or material discomfort to any person, d)loss of enjoyment of normal use of property.

That report concluded that \\"the noise impacts from both plants at the monitoring locations were below the applicable MOE guideline limites for Class 3 (Rural) areas\\".Report of Off-site Sequential Noise Monitoring Results, Pinchin Project: 79222, March 6, 2013 Following orders from the Ministry of the Environment early in the year, Unimin mine has embarked on a plan to cover tailings areas with vegetations. As shown in aerial photographs at the Annual Meeting of the Lake Association, significant progress has been made on the Blue Mountain site. At the Nephton tailings site the areas covered by vegetation are, as yet, limited. On Friday, July 22, 2013 there was a discharge of dust from the Nepthon tailings area documented through a number of eyewitness accounts, videos and photographs. \\"In response to these observations the Ministry issued a Provincial Officer‚Äôs Order to Unimin requiring them to update their dust control action plan and to implement additional controls before the end of this week to prevent dust from leaving the Nephton tailings area. While in the past, Unimin has given the impression to the Ministry that they had full control of their dust problems; Friday‚Äôs observations certainly show that they do not.

Description The magnificent sea anemone is characterized by a flared oral disc, which reaches between 20 and 50 cm in diameter, but in some specimens, this can reach 1 m.Weinberg S., 1996, DECOUVRIR LA MER ROUGE ET L‚ÄôOCEAN INDIEN, ed. Nathan nature, France, 415p. The oral disc, the base of the tentacles, and the oral orifice have the same color, going from light beige to white. The numerous tentacles exceed 8 cm long. The sea anemone, being a member of the Hexacorallia, usually carries tentacles in multiples of six that are positioned in concentric circles. Their tips are fingered and often lighter in coloration than the tentacle body and are sometimes vividly colored. Its specific scientific name, magnifica, and its vernacular name come from the bright color of the column, which is the visible outer structure when the animal retracts, and these range from electric blue to green, red, pink, purple, or brown. Distribution and habitat The magnificent sea anemone is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific area, from the eastern coasts of Africa, the Red Sea included, to Polynesia and from south Japan to Australia and New-CaledoniaFautin, D. 2007. Actinaria of New Caledonia. In: Payri, C. & Richer De Forges, B. [Eds]. Compendium of marine species of New Caledonia. Doc. Sci. Tech. IRD, Noum√©a. II7(2): 135. This anemone likes hard substrates well exposed to light and current from the surface to 20 m deep. It has been observed down to 40 m deep. Biology The magnificent sea anemone has two feeding methods. The first one is through the photosynthesis of its symbiotic zooxanthellae, living in its tissues. The second method is through using its tentacles to stun, immobilize, and consume prey (small invertebrates, fry, or juvenile fish). The reproduction of the anemone can be sexual by simultaneous transmission of male and female gametes in the water or asexual by scissiparity,Scott A., Harrison P.L., 2007, Embryonic and Larval Development of the Host Sea Anemones Entacmaea quadricolor and Heteractis crispa, Biol. Bull., 213, 110-121. which means that the anemone divides itself into two individuals, separating from the foot or the mouth. The magnificent sea anemone is found as solitary specimens throughout its range with aggregations only being found in the rim areas of its distribution. Genetic analyses does not suggest a difference between solitary specimens in the central distribution and clustering specimens at the rim. Asexual reproduction is found only in the rim areas and is probably the origin of the large aggregations. The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is highly nested in structure. With 12 species of hosted anemonefish, the magnificent sea anemone is highly generalist. The anemonefish it hosts are also mostly generalist, the exceptions being Amphiprion pacificus, only hosted by H magnifica, and A. akallopisos, which is also hosted by Stichodactyla mertensii. The species of anemonefish hosted by the magnificent sea anemone are: *Amphiprion akallopisos (skunk anemone fish) *A. akindynos (Barrier Reef anemonefish) *A. bicinctus (two-band anemonefish) *A. chrysogaster (Mauritian anemonefish) *A. chrysopterus (orange-fin anemonefish) *A.clarkii (Clark's anemonefish) *A. leucokranos (white-bonnet anemonefish) *A. melanopus (red and black anemonefish) *A. nigripes (Maldive anemonefish) *A. ocellaris (false clown anemonefish) *A. pacificus (Pacific anemonefish) *A. percula (clown anemonefish) *A. perideraion (pink skunk anemonefish) H. magnifica also hosts Dascyllus trimaculatus, the threespot dascyllus, and various commensal shrimps.

It is owned and operated by the DeKalb County School System, which announced in May 2012 it was considering closing the facility to cut its annual budget, then quickly shelved the plan after public outcry. The nearby Fernbank Museum of Natural History is a private non-profit organization that is separate from the Science Center.  Overview  The Fernbank Science Center opened in December 1967, and is an educational facility and an integral part of the DeKalb County School System. It provides programs for the science education of local students, pre-K-12. Both its planetarium and observatory are open for public shows on specific occasions. The mission of the Science Center is to provide and promote an understanding of science and technology and to communicate to its visitors the harmony and order of the natural world. Fernbank contains many materials for instruction, including dinosaur skeletons, rocks and minerals, a collection of tektites, an Aeronautics Education Laboratory and an electron microscope lab. The center also has an authentic Apollo spacecraft from the unmanned Apollo 6 Saturn V test flight, and is home to a planetarium with a -diameter projection dome.  Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium  The Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium is a 500-seat celestial theater in the round, equipped with a , a Mark V Zeiss star projector, and over 100 special effects projectors. The planetarium, which was built in the 1960s is the largest planetarium within the state of Georgia and one of the largest in the U.S. It was also the first planetarium to be owned and operated by a public school system in the United States of America. In 2012 Fernbank Science Center was the recipient of a grant from Lockheed Martin which was used to refurbish the Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium, and give the theater a technological upgrade bringing it into the 21st century and the digital age. A major component of technological upgrade is the fulldome/immersive projection system, produced by e-Planetarium of Houston. The fulldome system is intended to complement the planetarium's iconic Zeiss star projector not replace it. Prior to the 2012 upgrade, Fernbank staff had been using standard projectors for the video portions of the shows, which put an image on only a small segment of the dome. Since the upgrade, a digital immersive projection system throws extraordinarily bright light onto a spherical mirror tuned to the exact shape of the planetarium dome so video and other images cover the entire dome. Before the upgrade, science center staff had the capability to project images like a slide show. Since the 2012 upgrade, animated images can move across the entire surface. Robotics Team Fernbank LINKS (Linking Ideas and Networking Kids with Science) was established in 2002. Since then, the robotics team has participated in two robotics competitions, while winning many awards. All of their members graduate high school and pursue a college degree. In the fall, Fernbank LINKS competes in and hosts the free Georgia BEST Robotics Competition. During their original tenure from 2004-2014, LINKS had been one of the more successful BEST Teams in Georgia, consistently qualifying for the South's BEST Regional Championship at Auburn University. However, in 2015, they forfeited their chance to compete in order to host the Georgia BEST hub. Under their leadership, 12 BEST teams competed, with 2 qualifying for the South's BEST Regional Championship. In 2016, LINKS plans to expand the Georgia BEST hub to 24 teams, thus allowing more teams to experience the fun of STEM. In the spring, Fernbank LINKS competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Like the BEST Robotics Competition, teams are challenged to build a robot in 6 weeks. Following the main build season, teams prepare for and compete in competitions to advance to the FIRST Championship. In 2016, Fernbank LINKS became the first team in Georgia to win a district qualifier. They also became the first team from DeKalb County to win the Engineering Inspiration Award at the Peachtree District State Championship, qualifying them for the FIRST World Championship in St. Louis as part of the Tesla Division. At the FIRST Championship, they were ranked #16 out of 75 teams, but were eliminated in quarterfinal play. During the Fall and Winter, LINKS has been heavily involved with FIRST Lego League. Every Fall, LINKS hosts 6 free trainings for FLL teams in DeKalb County. In addition, they host the DeKalb FLL Regional Tournament and the Atlanta Super Regional tournament.

It is part of the Gilgo census-designated place.  History  West Gilgo Beach was founded in the late 1930s by residents of High Hill Beach, who were displaced by the creation of Jones Beach State Park. Some of their original houses were moved by barge, from Jones Beach to the new community; the others were moved by road over the newly constructed causeway connecting Jones Beach to Captree State Park. Since then, the West Gilgo Beach Association has grown to approximately 80 houses.  Description  Originally almost entirely a summer community, over half of the houses are now winterized, and there is a mix of full-time and second home residents. The community hosts a small non-denominational church, a self-service library, an unmanned post office, and small firehouses that have hoses on carts. Residents depend on central well water and individual septic tanks. Cable television remains inaccessible. The land is not owned by the residents, but is on long term lease from the Town of Babylon. In the early 1990s, there was litigation by New York State to not extend the lease. After much negotiation, the lease was renewed, with a ramp up in costs.  Noteworthy projects  In July 2011, West Gilgo Beach residents united to beautify the community via a large-scale mural painting in the beach-access tunnel. (Documentary)  Geography  West Gilgo Beach is located on Jones Beach Island, a barrier island situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great South Bay of Long Island. West Gilgo Beach is an L-shaped community with two roads: Ocean Walk, which begins at the border of Nassau County and Suffolk County and extends east along Ocean Parkway, and Bay Walk, which begins at the gate and heads north towards the South Oyster Bay. West Gilgo Beach is a Right-in/right-out exit from Ocean Parkway, between Tobay Beach and Gilgo Beach.

Rudolf II was born in Rheinfelden, Swabia, the youngest son of Count Rudolf of Habsburg and his first wife Gertrude of Hohenberg to survive infancy. In 1273 his father was elected king of Germany, the first of the Habsburg dynasty, whereafter he seized the \\"princeless\\" duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia from the Bohemian king Ottokar II. After King Ottokar was defeated and killed in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, King Rudolf in December 1282 vested his sons Albert and Rudolf II with the Austrian and Styrian duchies. However, in the Treaty of Rheinfelden on 1 June 1283 Rudolf II had to relinquish his share in favour of his elder brother Albert. In compensation Rudolf II was designated as future king and his father appointed him a \\"duke of Swabia\\" - more or less an honorific title, as the former stem duchy had been in long-term disarray after the last Hohenstaufen duke, the underage Conradin, was killed in 1268. In Swabia the former counts of Habsburg only held various smaller home territories, later summed up as Further Austria, of which Rudolf II never got hold. In the course of the reconciliation process with the Bohemian P≈ôemyslid dynasty, Rudolf II in 1289 married Agnes (1269-1296), daughter of the late King Ottokar II. Rudolf II died suddenly at the age of 20 in Prague, where he stayed at the court of his brother-in-law King Wenceslaus II. In the same year his son, John Parricida, was born. His brother's failure to ensure that Rudolf II would be adequately compensated for relinquishing his claim on the throne caused strife in the Habsburg dynasty, leading to the assassination of Albert I by Rudolph's son, John, in 1308. 1270 births 1290 deaths 13th- century rulers of Austria Rudolf 2 Rudolf 2 13th-century House of Habsburg Rulers deposed as children Medieval child rulers ","title":"Rudolf II, Duke of Austria"},{"id":"1213204","text":"Taleggio may refer to: *Taleggio, Lombardy, a comune in the Province of Bergamo *Val Taleggio, a valley mainly in the Province of Bergamo *Taleggio cheese, a cheese native to Val Taleggio ","title":"Taleggio"},{"id":"1213210","title":"PepsiCo"},{"id":"1213218","text":"Ricardo Vi√±es in 1919 Ricardo Vi√±es y Roda (, , ; 5 February 1875 - 29 April 1943) was a Spanish pianist.

He was the piano teacher of the composer Francis Poulenc and the pianists Marcelle Meyer, Joaqu√≠n Nin-Culmell and L√©o-Pol Morin. Life and career Vi√±es was born in Lleida, Spain. He studied the piano at the Paris Conservatoire under Charles-Wilfrid de B√©riot, and composition and harmony with Benjamin Godard and Albert Lavignac.Timbrell, Charles and Esperanza Berrocal. \\"Vi√±es, Ricardo\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, retrieved 19 September 2014 In 1895 Vi√±es made his d√©but at the Salle Pleyel, Paris. From 1900 he had an international career, touring in Russia and throughout Europe and South America. Between 1930 and 1936 he lived in Argentina, returning to Paris in 1936 where he continued to play until the final year of his life. According to Charles Timbrell and Esperanza Berrocal in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Vi√±es's keyboard technique was magnificent and his repertoire extensive. In addition to the established classics he championed new works by the many composers of whom he was a close friend. They included Ravel, Debussy, Satie, Falla, Granados, Alb√©niz and D√©odat de S√©verac. He was also a proponent of Russian music, and introduced to France pieces by Mussorgsky (Pictures at an Exhibition), Balakirev (Islamey) and Prokofiev (Sarcasmes). Grove lists among the many works dedicated to him Ravel's Oiseaux tristes, Debussy's Poissons d‚Äôor and Falla's Noches en los jardines de Espa√±a. Vi√±es composed a small number of works, the best known of which are the two Hommages, for S√©verac and Satie. He also wrote several articles, mostly on Spanish music, and his diaries are much quoted by biographers of his musical contemporaries. His piano students included Marcelle Meyer, Joaqu√≠n Nin-Culmell, L√©o-Pol Morin and Francis Poulenc. Poulenc later said of his teacher: An annual International piano competition \\"Ricard Vi√±es\\" has been held since 1995 in his birth town Lleida.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988 and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley. Early life Born on June 19, 1947, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Albert Kostyra and Jean Swetz, Eugene Michael Kostyra was educated at Ralph Brown Elementary School and Isaac Newton Junior High School. He dropped out of St. John's High School and worked as a clerk-typist and journeyman electrician. He became involved in Manitoba's trade union movement before entering politics, holding a prominent position in the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). Career = Politics = In the provincial election of 1981, Kostyra was elected for the north-end Winnipeg riding of Seven Oaks. On November 30, 1981, he was named Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, Minister of Culture, Heritage and Recreation and Minister of Urban Affairs, with responsibility for the Manitoba Housing and Renewal Corporation. He lost the last of these positions on February 12, 1982, although not before establishing the first rent controls in the province. On August 20, 1982, Kostyra was removed from the Consumer and Corporate Affairs portfolio and given responsibility for the Public Print Act and the Office of the Queen's Printer. On November 4, 1983, he was relieved of these latter responsibilities and the Urban Affairs portfolio, and named Minister of Industry, Trade and Technology, with responsibility for Manitoba Data Services and the Manitoba Development Corporation. On January 30, 1985, he was also given responsibility for the Manitoba Lotteries Foundation. Kostyra was re- elected in the provincial election of 1986. Following a cabinet shuffle on April 17, 1986, he was promoted to the senior position of Finance Minister and Chairman of the Manitoba Treasury Board, with responsibility for the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Special Supplementary Benefit Act, and the Public Servants Insurance Act. He also retained responsibility for the Manitoba Development Corporation until February 4, 1987. On September 21, 1987, he was named minister responsible for A.E. McKenzie Co. Ltd. In early 1988, Kostyra introduced his government's annual budget to the legislature, with the expectation that it would be passed by the narrow NDP majority in parliament. Instead, the government was defeated when disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding voted against the budget, despite having promised Kostyra that he would support it. The NDP had lost considerable support in the two years since their 1986 re-election, primarily as a result of the increased automobile insurance rates in the province and significant revenue shortfalls in the province's publicly owned telephone system. The NDP entered the 1988 election with almost no hope of retaining government, and retained only twelve seats; Kostyra himself was defeated in Seven Oaks by Liberal Mark Minenko. = Later career = Kostyra remained active in the labour movement after his loss, serving as a Regional Director of CUPE Manitoba. He was also an active promoter of credit unions over large banks in this period. In 1999, he was appointed by the NDP government of Gary Doer to head the province's powerful Community and Economic Development Committee of Cabinet. In 2003, Kostyra supported Bill Blaikie for the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party.  Death  Kostyra died on May 3, 2020 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

William was born in Dorchester County in the Province of Maryland, the second son of Jacob Hindman (1713‚Äì1766) and Mary Trippe Hindman (died 1782). Jacob was a plantation owner from Talbot county who served as sheriff of Talbot County from 1745 to 1748, and as a member of the colonial Assembly. William studied law at the Inns of Court in London, returning to Maryland in 1765. He was admitted to the bar, and practiced law in Talbot County. From 1775 and 1777, Hindman served in Maryland‚Äôs revolutionary government, as the state‚Äôs Treasurer for the Eastern Shore. He resigned this post when he was elected to the state Senate in 1777. He was re-elected several times, and served until 1784. Maryland sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1785 and 1786. Hindman returned to Maryland and served on the governor‚Äôs executive council from 1789 to 1792. In 1792 voters returned him to the state Senate, but later that year he was elected to the United States House of Representatives after the resignation of Joshua Seney.

The members were all prot√©g√©s of Jen≈ë Hubay (violin), a Hungarian pupil of Joseph Joachim and David Popper (cello), a Bohemian. Hubay and Popper had helped to make Budapest a major center for musical education, attracting famous students such as Joseph Szigeti. Hubay and Popper had supported S√°ndor V√©gh and Feri Roth in the formation of two other quartets bearing their respective names, and were themselves part of an earlier Budapest Quartet, the new quartet being named in its honor. The debut recital of the new Budapest String Quartet (in Hungarian: Budapesti Von√≥sn√©gyes), took place in December 1917 in Kolozsv√°r, then in Hungary, now called Cluj-Napoca in present-day Romania.Brandt (1993) pp 32-38 The quartet was established with the following rules: #All disputes, musical or business, were to be resolved by a vote. In case of a tie, no change. #Players were not allowed to take engagements outside the quartet. #Players were paid equally, with nothing extra for the leader (first violin). #No wives or girlfriends were permitted at rehearsals or discussions. No previous quartet had attempted to live entirely on the proceeds of its concerts. It was a brave decision for that time. Much later, in July 1930, the current members added another rule to resolve tied votes: One player, chosen by lot, would have a deciding vote. His initials would be written on the music, and he would always have the extra vote for that piece. If he was replaced, his successor would inherit his voting rights.Brandt p 50 The original members were Emil Hauser, aged 24, from Budapest; Alfred Indig, 25, from Hungary; Istv√°n Ipolyi, 31, from √öjvid√©k in Hungary; and Harry Son from Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. In 1920, Indig resigned in the hope of advancement; he was replaced by Imre Pogany, a native of Budapest who had studied under Hubay and Zolt√°n Kod√°ly. After resigning, Indig became a soloist with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra; and 1931 he became concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic. When the Nazis came to power, Indig fled to Paris where he led another quartet for a while. He then relocated to Amsterdam until 1951, and thereafter returned to Paris. His date and place of death remain unknown.Brandt pp 62-63 =Move to Berlin= In 1921 or 1922, owing to political unrest in Budapest, the quartet moved to Berlin where the group developed a large repertoire but received only mixed reviews. In 1925 the quartet debuted in London and signed a recording contract with His Master's Voice, making recordings at His Master's Voice Studio B at Hayes and the Queen's Small Hall .Alan Kelly: The Gramophone Company Limited His Master's Voice Matrix Series prefixed Bb/Cc Recorded by Various Experts for Head Office 15 March 1921 to 31 December 1930. August, 2000. In May 1927, without telling the others, Pogany traveled to Cincinnati to see his friend conductor Fritz Reiner about a job in the symphony orchestra there. He was offered the post of principal second violin, but refused it at that time. The other members of the quartet were furious because if he had left, they would have found it very difficult to find and rehearse a replacement player in time for the new season. In the ensuing row, Pogany resigned.Brandt pp 38-40 He then emigrated to America, and this time decided to join the Cincinnati Symphony and teach at the local conservatory. In 1929, he moved on to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini as principal second violin, remaining there until his retirement in 1958. =Josef Roisman ‚Äì second violin= The man recommended to replace Pogany was Josef Roisman, familiarly known as Joe. Roisman was born on 25 July 1900 in Odessa, and was started on the violin at the age of six with Pyotr Stolyarsky, who was also the first teacher of David Oistrakh and Nathan Milstein. After the tragic early death of Joe's father, a wealthy Odessa woman made it possible for him, his sister and mother to relocate to Berlin so that he could study with Alexander Fiedemann. There he befriended Boris Kroyt, another Odessan studying with Fiedemann. At the outbreak of World War I, the family returned to Odessa where Joe continued his studies with Naoam Blinder, another Odessan, who had just returned from England.Brandt pp 27-31 After the Russian revolution, Roisman was co-opted to play at farms and factories. He managed to escape in 1923 while working near Poland. He traveled to Prague, then to Berlin. In Berlin he met with Kroyt again, who found work for him in a film orchestra. It was during this time that the quartet offer came. Joe was comfortable and secure in the orchestra, but his first love was chamber music. In the end, his wife Polo persuaded him to take the financial risk and sacrifice involved. Immediately he began to regret it. Hauser and Son were constantly in dispute and soliciting his vote. Moreover, Roisman had his own issues, in particular involving Hauser and Ipolyi's inability to play in spiccato (German Springbogen, or with \\"bouncing\\" bow), so that the quartet was forced not to use it. The rest of the quartet had had to become expert in using another bowing technique (German Spitzen, or staccato at the point, or tip, of the bow) to get around Hauser and Ipolyi's lack of spiccato technique. Roisman found it very hard to readjust his bowing style accordingly. He had to spend many hours practicing, and was unhappy with the result. In Germany, the quartet was called das Spitzenquartett (not a compliment) because it substituted Spitzen (staccato) for Springbogen (spiccato).Brandt pp 41-42 Finally, in 1930/31, Son could stand the persistent arguments no longer and resigned. He emigrated to Palestine, and played in concerts there and abroad. Shortly before World War II, however, he made the unfortunate decision to return to Rotterdam. After the Germans invaded the Netherlands, he and his wife Marianne were arrested in Amsterdam, and died in 1942 in the notorious Auschwitz-Monowitz concentration camp.Nat Brandt makes no mention of Son's death in Auschwitz in \\"Con Brio\\"; this was first discovered and entered on Joods Community Monument and German Wikipedia in 2012; See entry for Henri Son at Joods Community Monument which includes a copy of his Amsterdam police registration card. =Mischa Schneider ‚Äì cellist= The new cellist was originally named Mojzesz Sznejder, later Germanized as 'Mischa Schneider'. Born in 1904 in Vilna, Russia (though some place it in Poland at that time) (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where celebrated violin virtuoso Jascha Heifetz was born in 1901, he had a difficult upbringing. The family had little money, and his father was a tyrant. Mischa often found himself defending his younger brother Sasha against their father. In 1920, at the age of 16, Mischa left home to study in Leipzig under Julius Klengel, his teacher's eminent teacher. Fellow students included Emanuel Feuermann, Gregor Piatigorsky and Jascha's brother Benar Heifetz. After graduating he moved to Frankfurt, where he taught at the Hoch Conservatory. He found that he suffered from stage fright when playing solo, a problem that did not exist when playing in a quartet. He joined the Prisca Quartet, but resigned after a while due to a personality clash with two of the other members. The Prisca had often played in Cologne and there he got to know the Reifenbergs, whose daughter Eva had married Emanuel Feuermann. It was Frau Reifenberg who introduced Schneider to the Budapest Quartet.Brandt pp 42-53 =American debut= In January and February 1931, the quartet made its first United States tour. Reviews were fairly good, but financially the tour was unrewarding. Arguments about Spitzen vs. Springbogen bowing and other matters persisted, and relations became difficult. Then in 1932, Hauser wanted to play some concerts with Alice Ehlers. The quartet refused to allow this deviation from the rules; there was an argument and he resigned.Brandt pp 50-53 He emigrated to Jerusalem, formed a quartet and founded the Palestine Music Conservatory. He helped eminent Polish-Jewish concert violinist Bronis≈Çaw Huberman rescue many Jews from Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany, and was instrumental in founding the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. In 1940 he moved to the U.S., teaching first at Bard College in upper New York State, and later at the Juilliard School of Music. Hauser returned to Israel in 1960, where he died in 1978 at the age of 84. =Roisman becomes the leader and Alexander Schneider the second violinist= Having lost Hauser, the quartet needed a new leader. Introducing an unknown player as first violin is a risky step for a quartet. Owing to the established relationships and 'comfort level', a transition from second violin to first is safer. For this reason, Roisman was persuaded to make the switch from second to first.Brandt pp 52-53 The new second was Mischa Schneider's younger brother Alexander (Sasha), born Abram Sznejder. At 13, he almost died of tetanus after an accidental knee injury. The tetanus distorted his joints, and recovery was long and painful. Sasha left Vilna in 1924 and joined his brother in Frankfurt, securing a scholarship to study violin with Adolf Rebner, the principal violin pedagogue at the Hoch Conservatory. In 1927, Alexander became leader (concertmaster) of an orchestra in Saarbr√ºcken; and in 1929, leader of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk Orchestra in Hamburg until 1932, when he was fired as a consequence of the ongoing Nazi campaign against Jews. It was time for him to leave Germany, and the Budapest vacancy happened at just the right moment.Brandt pp 53-59 After Sasha's arrival, the Quartet's level of performance improved immediately and the group began attracting larger audiences. Successful tours of the U.S., Dutch East Indies, Australia and New Zealand ensued; and in exchange for relocating to Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation guaranteed the quartet six months of work a year. Still, personal relations within the Quartet were poor. Sasha was often outvoted; he hated this, but Ipolyi was usually able to pacify him. Ipolyi himself had personal problems, Mischa had divorced his wife and remarried, and the group was still not profitable.Brandt pp 59-62 By 1934, Jews had been expelled from all German orchestras but the Quartet, as 'Hungarian' visitors, had been spared until one night, when they received threats from a Nazi group. They switched headquarters from Berlin to Paris overnight, never to return to Germany. They toured Europe and the U.S., but always lived in inexpensive hotels and ate cheaply.Brandt pp 60-62 =Last founding member leaves= Ipolyi became an isolated member of the quartet, the only Hungarian among three Russians. He was also the only Spitzen player left, old-fashioned in style and on the verge of a nervous breakdown as well. In 1936, the others persuaded him to resign. He settled in Norway, and during the German occupation was arrested but freed thanks to the intervention of Count Bernadotte, head of the International Red Cross. He fled to Sweden, but returned to Norway after the war. He became a Norwegian citizen, coached a quartet in Bergen and became a professor. Mischa Schneider made sure that Ipolyi received the royalties due him until the latter's death in 1955. =Boris Kroyt becomes violist= Finding a new violist to replace Ipolyi was urgent. The Australian Broadcast Corporation had engaged the Quartet for a twenty-week tour to start in May 1937 with four performances a week and the option of another ten weeks in New Zealand. They needed the money despite regular engagements in Europe and America. Roisman nearly hired Edgar Ortenberg, whom he had known when they were both children in Odessa and then again in Berlin in 1926, but Ortenberg's wife wanted him to stick to the violin. Roisman then tried to locate his teenage friend Boris Kroyt in Berlin. Until the Nazis became all-powerful Kroyt had lived well, but the Nazis stopped all Jews from working except in Jewish groups. He had a wife and a child to support, and they were all in danger. The Budapest offer came at the ideal moment. He was such a natural player that he could get away without practicing very much. They took time to get used to one another, but eventually attained a very high technical standard.Brandt pp 64‚Äì78 In November 1936, they reached New York and critics were impressed as never before, comparing them with Toscanini and Schnabel. Concerts were well attended. In spring 1937 they went on to Australia, New Zealand and Dutch East Indies with equally good results. When the time came to return to Europe, they considered settling in Australia and held a vote on it. The Spanish Civil War had closed many venues in Italy and all in Spain. The Schneiders voted for Australia, while the other two opted to move on. In accordance with their longstanding rule, a tie meant \\"no change\\" so they moved on. After playing in France and Britain, they reached New York again in March 1938.Brandt pp 78‚Äì80 All the U.S. concerts were negotiated by Annie Friedberg in New York. This continued throughout their time in the U.S., starting with very little money but eventually ending with excellent returns for them and her.Brandt pp 52, 84, 95, 96 They had made five U.S. tours with no difficulty, but this time they were refused entry. Their Nansen passports were not good enough, apparently. They were ignominiously carted off to Ellis Island in a coal barge. It took frantic string-pulling by Friedberg ‚Äì involving Mayor La Guardia ‚Äì to get them out just in time for their first concert. They weren't in optimal condition for a concert and thought their performance wasn't too good, but nonetheless they got a rave review from The New York Times. This, finally, opened the door to real success in the U.S. Suddenly all the critics were praising them as never before, and audiences and bookings flooded in.Brandt pp 3‚Äì6, 81‚Äì83 Considering the Munich Agreement of 1938 when Chamberlain appeased Hitler and what soon happened in Europe, the break came just in time. On April 25, 1938, they recorded the Mozart Clarinet Quintet with Benny Goodman for the Victor label. It sold well, although Goodman regretted not having first performed it live. He and the quartet made only three concerts together: October and November 1938 and August 1941. Each time, reviewers justifiably felt the result accurate (i.e., merely perfunctory) but uninspired as hoped for and expected.Brandt pp 86‚Äì88 In 1939 they again had good results in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, Norway and Britain but not in Spain and Italy, where fascism reigned and people were consequently more concerned with political issues. From the U.S., the group was commissioned to play five Stradivarius string instruments which needed regular use as part of the instrument collection at the Washington Library of Congress. These instruments had been purchased and donated by longtime influential contributor Gertrude Clarke Whittall. The recital hall on the grounds of the Library had been built in 1925 with funding donated by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, a major benefactress of chamber music and of several music festivals. At that time, the quartet felt it would keep them away from troublesome existing conditions in war-torn Europe.Brandt pp 12‚Äì26 =U.S. becomes the home base= In the summer they were back in the U.S. for three months at Mills College in Oakland, California, where they could relax. The Pro Arte Quartet was normally in summer residence there, but this year they preferred to stay in their home territory of Belgium. They never returned, their leader Alphonse Onnou died suddenly in Milwaukee during an American tour, and the Budapest resided at Mills for the next fifteen summers. The first summer there, they learned that World War II had broken out in Europe, where their contracts had consequently been voided. The Library of Congress offer now sounded quite attractive, and they accepted it. Their concerts there continued for many years, and the Library was an extremely important venue for them.Brandt pp 14-15 Since 1925 they had been making recordings for His Master's Voice, first at the Beethoven Saal in Berlin, then at the Abbey Road Studio in London and from 1938 on in Camden, New Jersey for RCA Victor, the U.S. subsidiary of His Master's Voice. The HMV contract was valid until June 1940. It was not paying well, RCA had a good stock of recordings not yet published and was not keen to make any more recordings in 1939. The quartet found it difficult to persuade RCA to give them as much work as they wanted, or to pay them as their new reputation might justify. Nor was RCA eager to extend the existing contract. The quartet felt that with their increasing reputation in the U.S., it could do better signing with, and recording for, Columbia Records. Columbia was delighted to sign the group and make as many recordings as the quartet wished, since it had no existing stock. The deal was made, and kept secret as long as possible. When RCA finally learned about it they protested, \\"We are astonished. ... [this is] close to a definite breach of faith.\\" They should have realized that they had no right to be the only negotiators in a deal. Over 35 years the quartet recorded 89 individual works, some of them several times. For many years it was Columbia's leading classical music seller, and so quite a loss to RCA.Brandt pp 89-91 Early on, however, there were difficulties. First the American Federation of Musicians, protecting American jobs, demanded that someone should pay two members to be \\"standbys\\" during recordings. The quartet and Columbia argued about which of them should pay. After this was settled, the AFM struck Columbia in a dispute over royalties that lasted until February 1945. Also, after war was declared, the U.S. Government rationed materials for making records. Even so, between 1941 and 1946, the quartet earned $60,000 from Columbia in royalties in addition to $16,000 from HMV.Brandt pp 91-93 =Alexander Schneider replaced by Edgar Ortenberg= Sasha felt he could and needed to work outside the quartet. As second violinist, he did not get the same challenges or independence as the leader. After thinking about this a lot, he finally reached his decision and told the others on November 26, 1943. He was still only 35, having spent eleven years in the quartet, and needed to expand his range. On January 1, 1944 the quartet selected the new second, Edgar Ortenberg, the man who had nearly become the violist a decade before.Brandt pp 97-102 Like Joe and Boris, Edgar had grown up in Odessa. Until the Russian Revolution his father had been a bank manager, but afterwards the Ortenbergs were very short of money. In 1921 he won the gold medal at the Odessa Conservatory, and was immediately hired to teach there. In 1924 he moved to Berlin for greener pastures just as Joe, the Schneiders, and Boris had done, where he immediately got a scholarship at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. He changed his name from Eleazer to Edgar, and started a quartet which toured Europe until 1933 when the Nazis sacked them all. He then quickly moved to Paris, where the Russian Conservatory there formed a quartet under his leadership which had some success in Europe. When war was threatened, he joined the French army but in April 1940 (just before the disastrous defeat by the invading Germans) was discharged due to illness, and he and his wife left Paris just ahead of the Germans. They went to Portugal and caught the very last Spanish ship departing for the U.S. After struggling in New York for some time, he received that second offer from the Budapest Quartet in December 1943 and this time accepted it.Brandt pp 102-104 Edgar was generally considered a fine replacement for Sasha except that some critics and all the players felt he should play more forcibly. On the other hand, he felt their playing was a bit rough. He also wanted to spend more time rehearsing since he needed to get used to their methods and accustomed to their large repertory. The others, especially Boris, were not so keen to rehearse. It took Edgar two years to feel fully at home, but still the others felt he should practice more on his own and he was becoming noticeably nervous. Critics still felt the quartet was wonderful, but not quite as good as before. Ortenberg was also exhausted by the constant traveling, and late in 1948 the others told him they wanted a different second violinist. As soon as it was made public, Ortenberg was swamped by other offers and last performed with the quartet on March 10, 1949 at Cornell University. He joined the Settlement Music School in Philadelphia, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. He also taught at Temple University from 1953 to 1978.Brandt pp 101-109 =Jac Gorodetzky= The new second violinist was Jac Gorodetzky. He was born in Odessa but the family moved to London when he was only one, to avoid a pogrom. They moved to the U.S. before the war, settling in Philadelphia. He was well thought of as a student and secured good positions in orchestras and quartets. Although his playing, like Ortenberg's, was a little quiet, he was well thought of during the Budapest auditions, when in his mid-thirties.Brandt pp 109-113 In 1950, the quartet went to Europe for the first time after the war. They agreed not to go to Germany, especially because Schneider had lost his mother and sister in Auschwitz. This tour, together with the continual demands in the U.S., heavily stressed Gorodetzky. He developed stage fright, and sometimes pleaded for extra rehearsals of works they had already played.Brandt pp 113-115 Then in September 1952, they played in Japan as the first quartet to tour there after the war. The whole season was sold out in two hours. Three thousand attended their first concert. There were staff to attend to their every need, and cars to take them everywhere. One night they felt the need to get some exercise in Okayama. They were walking on a narrow road, when Joe fell into a nine-foot ditch and broke his left wrist. They had it set at the U.S. military hospital in Tokyo. On their return to the U.S., they were told the wrist had been improperly set and had to be re=broken and reset. Concerts were switched to trios and piano quartets during Roisman's recovery. After months of hard work, he rejoined the quartet in Portland, Oregon on January 12, 1953.Brandt pp 110-118 A second Japanese tour in 1954 was even more successful, but Jac was getting more uncomfortable. In February, he told the others he wanted to leave. They hoped to talk him out of it, but none of them realized how unwell he was. Finally, in November 1955, he committed suicide in a small hotel in Washington. The other players felt awful, and played benefit concerts for his family at the Settlement Music School. Later, Mischa left them most of his music and on his death Joe left them most of his money.Brandt pp 119-122 =Alexander Schneider returns= Joe refused to accept another new second violinist, and fortunately they managed to persuade Sasha to return. Against their prior rule, they allowed him to spend some time working independently because they needed him and they did not want to take as many engagements as before. As soon as he returned, they all felt happier than they had for many years, their playing showed resultant rejuvenated strength and the critics were fulsome in their praise.Brandt pp 122-126 In the ten years away from the quartet, Sasha had been very busy. He rejected offers to lead the Pro Arte and Paganini Quartets, but toured and recorded with harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick, played and recorded unaccompanied Bach, and played and recorded trios and piano quartets with prominent New York chamber players. He studied with Pablo Casals in Prades, whom he persuaded to start festivals in Prades, San Juan (Puerto Rico), Israel and Marlboro (Vermont). He started his own Schneider Quartet to record all the Haydn quartets for the Haydn Society label, although the Society ran out of money before the project was finished. He persuaded Mrs Coolidge to sponsor free outdoor concerts in Greenwich Village, and played guest second violin with the Budapesters when Ortenberg or Gorodetzky was indisposed. =Decline= As the 1960s approached, the quartet was quite happy. It was the most popular and world-famous quartet, with 55 record albums published by Columbia and two million copies sold, and was playing in many famous venues and festivals. But then Joe's intonation began to fail him at times, apparently in the aftermath of a mild heart attack at the end of 1960. Only then did he tell the others that as long ago as 1939, he had been told of a problem with high blood pressure. He had occasionally had intonation problems before, which worsened late in 1960.Brandt pp 167-171 In March 1962, they played their final concert in the Library of Congress in the aftermath of several problems of which Joe's intonation had been the worst. Critics, listeners and Mrs Coolidge herself had complained. They were replaced by the brilliant young Juilliard Quartet of New York.Brandt pp 171-174 That autumn, in Europe, Joe suddenly suffered a slipped disc. He restarted playing in early 1963, however, and they returned to Australia after a 26-year absence. But Joe's energy level was declining, and they cut down the number of concerts year by year.Brandt pp 174-177 , =Marlboro College= In 1955, Sasha had joined the Marlboro Music School and Festival at Marlboro College in southern Vermont (see above). It was a school, a music festival and a summer retreat. Like a human whirlwind, he pushed the young players to stretch their talents. In time, he brought in the other Budapest players (see below), who helped make the place a breeding ground for a new generation of chamber musicians. The school had been founded in 1950 by incomparable chamber violinist Adolf Busch and eminent flautist Marcel Moyse, and their families. Busch died in 1952 before Sasha arrived, but his son-in-law, pianist Rudolf Serkin, was still quite active and he and Sasha became staunch friends, the latter spending the next twenty summers there.Brandt pp 177-185 In 1962 Sasha persuaded Mischa to come too, and the next year the whole quartet came, followed by many other outstanding experienced musicians and many talented younger players, all reaching high standards. Some students found Sasha assertive to the point of aggressively demanding, and his manner was a bit hard on those who were nervous or not dedicated to strive for the highest standards, while Mischa and Boris were gentler. They were very willing to try new ideas from their students, and each generation was inspired by the enthusiasm of the other. Sasha persuaded Michael Tree, Arnold Steinhardt, John Dalley and David Soyer to form a brilliant new quartet ‚Äì a daunting challenge for any player ‚Äì and Boris suggested the name Guarneri. They spent a lot of time together at Marlboro, and the Guarneri Quartet may be regarded as the musical heirs of the Budapest. Sasha advised them, \\"Whenever you play string trios and piano quartets, make it a rule that the second violin plays it and not the first. ... If you play only second violin, you get stale for other things.\\" He said that, after he left the Budapest, it took him three years to get back to good playing condition.Brandt p 99 The newest super-virtuosic New York group, the Emerson String Quartet, takes a similar view, and solves it by the two violinists, Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer, alternating between first and second. In later years, the Budapest played fewer concerts and saw each other only for concerts, but still to admiring capacity audiences, but no longer practiced very often either individually or together. Errors in detail were the inevitable result, but the general effect was still good. Sasha felt he wanted to share what he was still learning, but Joe wanted to stay as he was.Brandt pp 186-189 =Conclusion= In January 1965 the group spent twelve days recording Dvo≈ô√°k's F major \\"American\\" Quartet and Smetana's E minor Quartet \\"From My Life\\". Joe had major intonation problems during the sessions, and Mischa had trouble with his back. A recording of the Dvo≈ô√°k was spliced together from multiple takes and published, but the players refused to accept a similar splice of the Smetana. Then Mischa, Boris and the Guarneri performed and recorded Tchaikovsky's D minor Sextet ‚ÄúSouvenir de Florence‚Äù with success. Immediately thereafter Mischa needed back surgery, which had troubled him since 1930. The operation failed, as did a second procedure. He never played again but he did teach extensively, including 25 summers at the Marlboro Music Festival, until his death on October 3, 1985 in Buffalo, New York.Bernard Holland, \\"MISCHA SCHNEIDER DIES AT 81; CELLIST FOR BUDAPEST QUARTET\\", The New York Times, October 5, 1985Brandt pp 190-195 In 1977, Sasha abruptly left Marlboro. He never explained why, but he and Serkin remained fast friends. In 1969, Boris died of cancer. In 1974, Joe suffered a fatal heart attack. In 1993 Sasha succumbed to heart failure, having played almost to the end. The Budapest String Quartet had a huge influence on chamber music in the United States and internationally. When they relocated to the U.S. in the late 1930s, it was hard to attract large audiences. The concerts in Washington and New York, the radio broadcasts and the many records gradually raised audience numbers, made them famous and wealthy, and set high performance standards for later quartet and other chamber groups to follow and even improve upon.Brandt pp 196-203 Jascha Heifetz was once quoted as saying: \\"One Russian is an anarchist. Two Russians are a chess game. Three Russians are a revolution. Four Russians are the Budapest String Quartet.\\"Brandt dust jacket  Recordings  The following listings begin with 1932; this is the year in which Josef Roisman became the quartet's leader as 1st Violin, replacing Emil Hauser, and Alexander Schneider joined the quartet as 2nd violin. Thus with the exception of Istv√°n Ipolyi, who stayed until 1936, the quartet had nearly completed its transformation to its relatively stable line-up of four Russians, and achieved its long-lasting reputation.

By killing his uncle, King Albert I of Germany, he foiled the first attempt of the Habsburg dynasty to install a hereditary monarchy in the Holy Roman Empire. Life John was born shortly before or after the death of his father Rudolf II, the younger son of King Rudolf I of Germany. His mother was Agnes, daughter of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. He passed his early days at the Bohemian court and the town of Brugg in the Swabian home territory of the Habsburgs, where he is mentioned as titular duke in a 1294 deed. As John's father had been forced to waive his right to the Habsburg duchies of Austria and Styria in favour of his elder brother Albert I according to the 1283 Treaty of Rheinfelden, he felt deprived of his inheritance. When he came of age, he demanded a portion of the family estates from his uncle, who had finally prevailed in the election as King of the Romans against Adolph of Nassau in 1298. His wishes, however, were not gratified nor did he receive any of the compensations in the Swabian territories of Further Austria, awarded to his father by the Rheinfelden Treaty. In 1306, King Albert even placed his son, Duke Rudolf III, on the Bohemian throne, denying his nephew's right of inheritance. Thereupon John, mocked as \\"Duke Lackland\\" (Hertzog Anlant), with several companions of Swabian nobility formed a plan to murder the king. A Habsburg family banquet in Winterthur, held by Albert on the evening of 30 April 1308, gave rise to a scandal, when the invitee John rejected a floral wreath offered by his uncle, exclaiming that he won't let himself be fobbed off with flowers. The next day, King Albert on his way home became separated from his attendants when crossing the Reuss River near Windisch, and was at once attacked by John and his conspirators. John rode toward his uncle and split his skull without a word. He escaped the vengeance of Albert's sons, and from that point his fate remained unknown. In the same year, the prince- electors chose the Luxembourg count Henry VII as Albert's successor, who placed John under the imperial ban (Reichsacht). John allegedly fled to Italy and found refuge in a Pisa monastery, where, in 1313, he is said to have been visited by Emperor Henry VII. After the defeat of Albert's son Frederick the Fair at the 1322 Battle of M√ºhldorf, the Habsburg dynasty was not able to regain the German crown until the election of Albert II in 1438. Fictional character The character of John is rendered by Friedrich Schiller in his 1804 drama William Tell:Act V, scene 2 John on the run arrives at Tell's house begging for help and arguing that he had to take revenge on his enemy ‚Äî like Tell on bailiff Albrecht Gessler. Tell rejects the comparison but directs him to Italy, advising him to seek papal absolution. John's fate was further perpetuated in the poem Der Graf von Thal (1838) by Annette von Droste- H√ºlshoff and by the Austrian writer Johann Nepomuk Vogl, whose ballad Der M√∂nch zu Pisa was set to music by Carl Loewe (Op. 114) in 1846. Historical dramas were written by August Gottlieb Mei√üner (Johann von Schwaben, 1770) and Julius Grosse (Johann von Schwaben, 1870).

Aslaug in legend King Heimer and Aslaug. Painting by August Malmstr√∂m (1856). According to the 13th-century Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, Aslaug was the daughter of Sigurd and the shieldmaiden Brynhildr, but was raised by Brynhildr's foster father Heimer. At the deaths of Sigurd and Brynhildr, Heimer was concerned about Aslaug's security, so he made a harp large enough to hide the girl. He then traveled as a poor harp player carrying the harp containing the girl. √Åke and Grima discover Aslaug. Painting by M√•rten Eskil Winge (1862). They arrived at Spangereid at Lindesnes in Norway, where they stayed for the night in the house of the peasants √Åke and Grima. √Åke believed the harp contained valuable items and told his wife Grima. Grima then persuaded him to murder Heimer as he was sleeping. However, when they broke the harp open, they discovered a little girl, whom they raised as their own, calling her Kr√°ka (\\"Crow\\"). In order to hide her beauty ‚Äì the accepted sign of her noble origins ‚Äì they rubbed her in tar and dressed her in a long hood. However, once as she was bathing, she was discovered by some of the men of the legendary king Ragnar Lodbrok. Entranced by Kr√°ka's beauty, they allowed the bread they were baking to burn; when Ragnar inquired about this mishap, they told him about the girl. Ragnar then sent for her, but in order to test her wits, he commanded her to arrive neither dressed nor undressed, neither fasting nor eating, and neither alone nor in company. Kr√°ka arrived dressed in a net, biting an onion, and with only a dog as a companion. Impressed by her ingenuity and finding her a wise companion, Ragnar proposed marriage to her, which she refused until he had accomplished his mission in Norway. Scholarship According to Marilyn Jurich, Aslaug's tale in the Saga of Ragnar Lodbrok is the prototype of the \\"Clever Peasant Girl\\" folk tale, Aarne‚ÄìThompson no. 875. The saga matches the tale closely up to Aslaug's marriage to Ragnar, but even after that there are similarities: The saga highlights Aslaug's resolve (she refuses sex to Ragnar until after marriage) and her seemingly preternatural wisdom: because Ragnar insists on bedding her immediately after the wedding, contrary to her advice, their first son Ivar was born weak, \\"boneless\\". The Brothers Grimm discuss the similarities of their tale 1815 #8 \\"Die kluge Bauerntochter,\\" with the Nordic tale of Kraka in the appendix entry of the text. They also discuss similarities to a tale in Johannes Pauli's \\"Schimpf und Ernst\\" from 1519/1522. In other fiction The romantic poem The Fostering of Aslaug by William Morris is a retelling of Aslaug's relationship with Ragnar, based on the version of the tale in Benjamin Thorpe's Northern Mythology (1851). It is changed in tone and emphasis by Morris' romanticism, excising the saga's more somber and complicated motifs and portraying Ragnar as the typical hero wooing the maiden. She appears in Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√©'s \\"Aslauga's Knight,\\" published in 1810 with two other Icelandic romances as Der Held des Nordens (The Hero of the North). A principal character in the television series Vikings (2013), played by Alyssa Sutherland, is loosely based on the legend, and introduced to Ragnar in the manner it described.

He was born in Berlin into a middle-class Protestant family. Dertinger briefly studied law and economics. After his study he became a journalist and later editor for the Magdeburger Volkszeitung and the nationalistic newspaper Der Stahlhelm. He broke with the Stahlhelm because of its rigid right-wing philosophy. He sympathized with the German National People's Party, a right-wing nationalist party. Dertinger later became a member of the political circle around Chancellor Franz von Papen. He accompanied Papen to Rome as a journalist, a representative for the Hamburger Nachrichten, for the signature of the Concordat between Germany and the Holy See, shortly after Hitler became Chancellor. In 1934 Dertinger returned to Berlin and became publisher of Dienst aus Deutschland, a news agency that provided news to foreign newspapers. After World War II Dertinger co-founded the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the SBZ (Soviet Occupied Zone) of Germany. From 1946 to 1949 he was General Secretary of the East- German CDU and from 1949 to 1953 Vice-Chairman of the party.

Rudolph of Habsburg had been chosen King of the Romans in 1273 and had defeated his rival Ottokar II of Bohemia who was killed at the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. Ottokar's son Wenceslaus II retained the Bohemian Kingdom, while Ottokar's estates in Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola fell back to the Holy Roman Empire. King Rudolph had reached an agreement with the Prince-electors to award these territories to his sons and at the Diet of Augsburg in 1282 Albert I and his brother Rudolph II \\"jointly and severally\\" received Austria, Styria, Carniola and the Windic March. However in 1286 Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol became Duke of Carinthia as recompensation for supporting King Rudolph against Ottokar and also retained Carniola and the Windic March as a fief. Deviating from these decisions the Rheinfelden Treaty set down the primogeniture order: then eleven-year-old Duke Rudolph II had to waive all his rights to the thrones of Austria and Styria to the benefit of his elder brother Albert I. According to the terms of the agreement, Rudolf should receive some territories in Further Austria in return but was never compensated until his death in 1290. This fact induced his son John Parricida to murder Albert in 1308. The adoption of the primogenitur right crucially strengthened the Habsburg influence within the Holy Roman Empire as it allowed the dynasty to constitute a compact allodial territory (Hausmacht) it could rely on. It nevertheless did not prevent the partition by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg.

He worked, largely isolated from most other scientists of the period, at the Berlin Aquarium where he took care of fishes, reptiles and birds, especially waterfowl.  Biography  Heinroth was born in Mainz-Kastel. He studied medicine and graduated in 1895 but later studied zoology at Berlin while working at the Zoological Garden and at the Natural History Museum. He joined an expedition to the Bismarck Archipelago in 1900-1901 serving as a zoologist to Bruno Mencke, the South Seas expedition leader who was attacked and killed in an encounter with indigenous peoples while Heinroth himself escaped with a spear wound. In 1904 Heinroth became an assistant at the Berlin Zoological Garden. He began his studies of duck and goose behavior while working as a scientific assistant from 1898 to 1913. In 1911 he became the director of the Berlin Aquarium, a post he held for more than 30 years. He married Magdalena n√©e Wiebe (1883-1932) who was also interested in animals and was a skilled taxidermist and aviculturist. After her death, Heinroth married Katharina Heinroth n√©e Berger in 1933, a herpetologist who headed the Berlin Zoo after World War II. He died in Berlin on 31 May 1945. Heinroth was largely self taught and was not affiliated to any academic institution but his second wife Katharina had received a doctorate in 1925 under Otto Koehler (1889‚Äì1974) and together they published numerous pioneering works on animal behaviour.  Contributions to zoology  Heinroth made extensive studies of behavior in the Anatidae (ducks and geese) and made bold hypotheses that many of their instinctive behavior patterns and morphological features correlated with their life histories. He suggested for instance that the conspicuous wing patterns of ducks might serve to guide flocks in flight. He also recognized that ducks with sexual dimorphism tended to have polygamous males with large testes. Heinroth noted behaviours of ducks and those of hybrids and suggested that there behavioural cues could be used to deduce taxonomic relationships. Heinroth had noted that chickens were alarmed by long-tailed and short-necked birds suggesting that these were the key characteristics of birds of prey. The idea that this response was instinctive was examined in greater detail by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. He also rediscovered the phenomenon of imprinting, reported in the 19th century by Douglas Spalding but not followed up at the time. His results were popularized by Konrad Lorenz, his pupil. Heinroth introduced the word \\"ethologie\\" as it is currently understood in his 1910 Beitrage zur Biologie, namentlich Ethologie und Psychologie der Anatiden. Lorenz regarded Heinroth as the true founder of the study of animal behavior seen as a branch of zoology. Lorenz also credited Heinroth with creating an important method for understanding instincts in birds. Commemorative plaque in Berlin Bibliography * The Birds (with Katharina Heinroth).

Traditional techniques for micronization focus on mechanical means, such as milling and grinding. Modern techniques make use of the properties of supercritical fluids and manipulate the principles of solubility. The term micronization usually refers to the reduction of average particle diameters to the micrometer range, but can also describe further reduction to the nanometer scale. Common applications include the production of active chemical ingredients, foodstuff ingredients, and pharmaceuticals. These chemicals need to be micronized to increase efficacy. Traditional techniques Traditional micronization techniques are based on friction to reduce particle size. Such methods include milling, bashing and grinding. A typical industrial mill is composed of a cylindrical metallic drum that usually contains steel spheres. As the drum rotates the spheres inside collide with the particles of the solid, thus crushing them towards smaller diameters. In the case of grinding, the solid particles are formed when the grinding units of the device rub against each other while particles of the solid are trapped in between. Methods like crushing and cutting are also used for reducing particle diameter, but produce more rough particles compared to the two previous techniques (and are therefore the early stages of the micronization process). Crushing employs hammer-like tools to break the solid into smaller particles by means of impact. Cutting uses sharp blades to cut the rough solid pieces into smaller ones. Modern techniques Modern methods use supercritical fluids in the micronization process. These methods use supercritical fluids to induce a state of supersaturation, which leads to precipitation of individual particles. The most widely applied techniques of this category include the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the SAS method (Supercritical Anti-Solvent) and the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions). These modern techniques allow for greater tuneability of the process. Parameters like relative pressure and temperature, solute concentration, and antisolvent to solvent ratio are varied to adjust the output to the producer's needs. The supercritical fluid methods result in finer control over particle diameters, distribution of particle size and consistency of morphology. Because of the relatively low pressure involved, many supercritical fluid methods can incorporate thermolabile materials. Modern techniques involve renewable, nonflammable and nontoxic chemicals. = RESS = In the case of RESS (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions), the supercritical fluid is used to dissolve the solid material under high pressure and temperature, thus forming a homogeneous supercritical phase. Thereafter, the mixture is expanded through a nozzle to form the smaller particles. Immediately upon exiting the nozzle, rapid expansion occurs, lowering the pressure. The pressure will drop below supercritical pressure, causing the supercritical fluid - usually carbon dioxide - to return to the gas state. This phase change severely decreases the solubility of the mixture and results in precipitation of particles. The less time it takes the solution to expand and the solute to precipitate, the narrower the particle size distribution will be. Faster precipitation times also tend to result in smaller particle diameters. = SAS = In the SAS method (Supercritical Anti- Solvent), the solid material is dissolved in an organic solvent. The supercritical fluid is then added as an antisolvent, which decreases the solubility of the system. As a result, particles of small diameter are formed. There are various submethods to SAS which differ in the method of introduction of the supercritical fluid into the organic solution. = PGSS = In the PGSS method (Particles from Gas Saturated Solutions) the solid material is melted and the supercritical fluid is dissolved in it. However, in this case the solution is forced to expand through a nozzle, and in this way nanoparticles are formed. The PGSS method has the advantage that because of the supercritical fluid, the melting point of the solid material is reduced. Therefore, the solid melts at a lower temperature than the normal melting temperature at ambient pressure. Applications Pharmaceuticals and foodstuff ingredients are the main industries in which micronization is utilized. Particles with reduced diameters have higher dissolution rates, which increases efficacy. Progesterone, for example, can be micronized by making very tiny crystals of the progesterone.wdxcyber.com >Progesterone - Its Uses and Effects Frederick R.

As a songwriter, he was known as Jesse Oris Farrow. He is best known for writing the quintessential 1960s love-and-peace anthem \\"Get Together\\", and for writing and singing on Quicksilver Messenger Service's two best-known songs, \\"Fresh Air\\" and \\"What About Me?\\" History Before serving in the United States Air Force and playing in the coffeehouses of Boston and Provincetown, Massachusetts, Powers had already performed as \\"Dino Valenti\\" with small rock bands in New England lounges. In the early 1960s, he performed in Greenwich Village and North Beach coffeehouses such as the Cock 'n' Bull and the Cafe Wha? at the height of the American folk-music revival, often with fellow singer-songwriter Fred Neil, and occasionally with Karen Dalton, Bob Dylan, Lou Gossett, Josh White, Len Chandler, Paul Stookey, David Crosby and others. He influenced other performers, most notably Richie Havens, who continued to perform some of Powers' early \\"train songs\\". Powers was prevented from acquiring a cabaret license due to an earlier arrest, a requirement that was beginning to be imposed on Village entertainers at the time. By 1963, Valenti/Powers moved to Los Angeles, where many luminaries in the imminent folk rock movement had already begun to coalesce. During this period, he wrote and popularized \\"Let's Get Together.\\" Frequently covered as \\"Get Together,\\" the song was performed by a diverse array of groups throughout the decade, including The Kingston Trio, We Five, The Dave Clark Five, H. P. Lovecraft, Jefferson Airplane and in particular The Youngbloods, whose 1967 rendition peaked at No. 5 and attained a RIAA gold certification in the United States upon its 1969 re-release (prompted in part by the National Conference of Christians and Jews employing the song as their theme in television and radio commercials). He also popularized and controversially claimed the copyright of Billy Roberts's \\"Hey Joe.\\" Valenti/Powers then returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he recorded for Autumn Records (an acetate of these sessions exists in a Quicksilver collector's possession), though no album was ever issued. He had been friendly with Roger McGuinn in Los Angeles and it is said that drummer Michael Clarke played in a band with Valenti/Powers in Big Sur before joining McGuinn in The Byrds. He is said to have played in an early (albeit undesignated) line-up of the San Francisco psychedelic rock group Quicksilver Messenger Service when John Cipollina, David Freiberg, and Jim Murray all joined his backing group in 1964. Powers' career was blighted by several drug busts. After an arrest for possession of marijuana, he was searched again by police (who found more marijuana and amphetamines in his apartment) while awaiting trial. He received a one-to-ten-year sentence served in part at Folsom State Prison. To raise money for his defense, he sold the publishing rights for \\"Get Together\\" to Frank Werber, the manager of The Kingston Trio. After completing his sentence, Valenti/Powers signed as a solo artist with CBS's Epic Records, releasing an eponymous album under a variation of his pseudonym (Dino Valente) in 1968. Shortly thereafter, he served as the opening act for Jimi Hendrix at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom from October 10‚Äì12, 1968, which exposed his solo work to a broader audience. He traveled with Quicksilver's Gary Duncan to New York in January 1969 to form a new band (to be called The Outlaws) shortly before Quicksilver's noted album Happy Trails appeared in March. While Valenti/Powers and Duncan were in New York, British keyboardist Nicky Hopkins joined Quicksilver for their third album, Shady Grove (December 1969). As 1969 progressed, The Outlaws came to naught, eventually leading to Duncan's reinstatement and Valenti/Powers formally joining Quicksilver at the band's New Year's Eve concert. Eight of the nine songs on the group's next album, Just for Love (August 1970) were written by Valenti/Powers, six of them under the pseudonym of \\"Jesse Oris Farrow,\\" including the single \\"Fresh Air,\\" a moderate American hit that peaked at No. 49 in November 1970. He remained the primary songwriter on their next album, What About Me? (December 1970). The Valenti/Powers-penned title track scraped the Billboard 100 in March 1971, peaking at No. 100. While not big as singles, both of these songs became hits on progressive rock and album- oriented rock radio formats, and would later be heard in the classic rock format. Following the departure of Cippolina and Freiberg (who had been convicted of marijuana possession), the band subsequently released Quicksilver (1971) and Comin' Thru (1972) as various Valenti/Powers-fronted lineups (always including Duncan and drummer Greg Elmore) continued to tour irregularly through 1974. The 1969‚Äì1971 lineup (with Hopkins only contributing as a session musician on select tracks) briefly reunited in 1975 for Solid Silver and a promotional tour; however, the much-anticipated album only reached No. 89 in the United States. Although Freiberg (then a multi- instrumentalist in Jefferson Starship) and Cippolina soon departed, an iteration of the band including Valenti/Powers, Duncan and Elmore once again continued to tour through 1979. Powers underwent surgery for a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (CAVM) in the late 1980s. In spite of suffering from short-term memory loss and the effects of anti-convulsive medications, he continued to write songs and play with fellow Marin County musicians. His last major performance was a benefit at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall. He died suddenly at his home in Santa Rosa, California on November 16, 1994, leaving behind a younger sister, Katherine (Kay), and three sons, Paul, Joli and Sterling.

The faithful climb up to the temple and obtain Darshan of the shivling and obtain blessings of the Lord. It is also possible to take an elevator up to the temple. The temples is visited by lakhs of devotees on annual Mahashivratri festival. Since Raja Bhimdev's Time Front view of the Temple' Babulnath Temple Shiva Linga and Idols were originally consecrated in the 12th century by the then Hindu king Bhimdev of the region. Over a period of time the temple was buried and lost over a period of time. The idols were re-discovered (unearthed) during the period of 1700 to 1780. The first temple was built in the 1780 year. 'Babulnath, Maharashtriyan style' When rediscovered, 5 original idols were dug out. That of the main Shiva Linga, Ganesh, Hanuman, Parvati and one more. Out of this the first four are in the temple. The fifth one was immersed in the sea because it was broken when it was dug out in the 18th century. Very famous temple in the 21st century, known for the active blessings. History When the first temple was built, the land belonged to the Parsi community. There were 5 Dakhma's (Parsi final resting place) existing in the vicinity. There was a lot of resistance for the Parsi community at that time for the building of the temple. This resistance continued till late 1800 when the issue was settled by the courts in favour of the temple. Old Temple The Babulnath Temple was patronised when built for the first time by Hindu merchant of that time and mainly the Gujarati community. A bigger temple was built in 1890 by contributions from the Gujarati merchants and the likes of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaikwad of Baroda state. The current temple structure can be dated back to 1890. The temple height was considerable when built in 1890 but a lightning strike in the 1960s and damage to the spire lowered the height of the present temple considerably. Till the 1980s Babulnath Temple was one of the Tallest structure & location in the city of Mumbai. There is limited reference to Babulnath Temple in the historical texts, because in the initial days the temple was frequented by yogis who used to stay there for \\"Dhyan\\" (Quiet & Concentrated Meditation) and remain quietly in the vicinity/radius of the Shivling's vibrations. However the temple famed in the 20th century. Currently the temple is thronged by people on Mondays and during Mahashivratri & Shravan months.

Life Little is known of his life, but internal evidence in his compositions indicates he was probably at the French royal chapel during the first two decades of the 16th century, at least, and was also associated with the cathedral in Meaux, on the Marne east of Paris. He composed music for ceremonial occasions, for example a sombre lament for the death of Queen Anne of Brittany (1514), and he also composed a motet which lists all the composers which he considered to be the most celebrated in France, arranged chronologically, and ending with Josquin. Documents from the Vatican (1505‚Äì1513) help establish his identity, as they indicate that a \\"Petrus Moulu\\" held various clerical positions at Meaux Cathedral. He may have written his mass Stephane gloriose, for the cathedral of St Etienne (Saint Stephen) in this town.Zwitser, Missa Paranymphus Music Moulu's music was clearly influenced by Josquin, and though Pierre Ronsard wrote that Moulu studied with Josquin, no documentary evidence survives to substantiate this claim. The motet Anxiatus est in me spiritus meus which laments Queen Anne's death is modeled on a similar, and much more famous composition by Josquin for the death of Ockeghem, La D√©ploration sur la mort Ockeghem. Moulu's music shows the style of pervasive imitation and smooth polyphony with exactly equal voices which was prevalent in the generation after Josquin (well exemplified by, and perhaps most famous in, the music of Nicolas Gombert). Of Moulu's music, five masses survive, the most famous being his mass on the Marian antiphon Alma Redemptoris Mater, which can be sung in two different manners: with or without rests longer than a quarter. The latest discovery is the mass Paranymphus, based on a motet by Loyset Comp√®re. In addition to the masses, Moulu wrote motets and chansons, some of which are of doubtful authorship (Mouton and Josquin are also suggested as the composer for several of these pieces). =Masses= # Missa Alma Redemptoris mater, 4vv # Missa Missus est Gabriel angelus (based on the motet by Josquin), 4vv # Missa Mittit ad virginem, 4vv # Missa Paranymphus (based on the motet by Comp√®re), 4vv # Missa Stephane gloriose, 4vv =Motets= # Adest nobis dies laetitiae, 4vv; # Alleluia, Regem ascendentem, 4vv; # Domine Dominus noster, 4vv; (by Mouton) # Fiere attropos, 5vv; # Induta est caro mea, 4vv; # In hoc ego sperabo, 3vv; # In illo tempore, 4vv; (probably by Mouton) # In omni tribulatione, 4vv; (by Mouton) # In pace, 5vv; # Mater floreat florescat, 4vv; # Ne projicias, 6vv; # Oculi omnium, 3vv; # O dulcis amica Dei, 5vv; # Oremus pro conctis, 4vv; # Quam dilecta, 3vv; # Quam pulchra es 4vv; (also attributed to Mouton) # Regina caeli, 4vv; # Salve Barbara martyr, 7vv; # Salve regina Barbara, 4vv; # Sancta Maria, Dei mater, 4vv; (only alt-voice) # Saule, Saule, quid me persequeris, 4vv; (by Jean le Brung) # Sicut malus, 3vv; # Tu licet (same as the 'Crucifixus' from the Missa Alma Redemptoris mater), 2vv; # Virgo carens criminibus, 4vv; (by Andreas de Silva) # Vivo ego, 3vv; # Vulnerasti cor meum, 5vv. =Chansons= # Amy souffrez, 3vv; (by Heinrich Isaac) # Au bois, au bois, madame, 4vv; # En despit des faux mesdisans, 6vv; # Et dout ven√®s vous, 3vv; # Hellas, hellas madame, 4vv; # J'ay mis mon cueur, 7vv; (probably by Descaudain) # La rous√©e de moys de may, 6vv; (by Mouton) # N'aym√©s jamais ces gens, 3vv; # Voicy le may, 4vv. In addition some works of Moulu have survived without text. For example, as late as 1592, an untexted 3-voice canon appears in Lodovico Zacconi's Prattica de musica under the name 'Pietro Molu'. This canon already appeared in 1503, printed by Petrucci, so Moulu's atrribution is very unlikely.

Born in a family of high social status and of noble descent, Fa Zheng travelled to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) in the late 190s and became a subordinate of Liu Zhang, the provincial governor. However, his feelings of alienation and perception of Liu Zhang as an incompetent governor eventually led him to betray Liu Zhang and defect to Liu Bei in 211. Between 211 and 214, Fa Zheng assisted Liu Bei in overcoming Liu Zhang and seizing control of Yi Province, and became one of Liu Bei's most trusted advisers. In 217, he urged Liu Bei to launch the Hanzhong Campaign to capture the strategic Hanzhong Commandery from a rival warlord, Cao Cao, but died a year after Liu emerged victorious in the campaign. Fa Zheng's keen foresight and brilliance in formulating strategies earned him praise from his contemporaries such as Zhuge Liang and Chen Shou. In less than a decade serving under Liu, Fa showed an near unmatched sense of timing where military geniuses like Cao Cao and his best advisers fell victim to his schemes. However, he was also notorious for his vindictive personality. When he held office, he abused his power by taking revenge against those who had offended him before, and by killing them without reason. Nevertheless, he was still highly regarded and trusted by Liu Bei ‚Äì to the point where Zhuge Liang once said that Fa Zheng might have been the only person capable of preventing Liu Bei from starting the disastrous Battle of Xiaoting in 221 if he were still alive. Family background Fa Zheng's ancestral home was in Mei County (), Youfufeng Commandery (), which is in present-day Mei County, Shaanxi. His ancestor was Tian Fazhang, who is historically known as King Xiang of the Qi state in the Warring States period. Tian Fazhang's descendants changed their family name from \\"Tian\\" to \\"Fa\\" after the fall of Qi in 221 BCE.(Ê≥ïÈõÑÂ≠óÊñáÂΩäÔºåÊâ∂È¢®ÈÉø‰∫∫‰πüÔºåÈΩäË•ÑÁéãÊ≥ïÁ´†‰πãÂæå„ÄÇÁß¶ÊªÖÈΩäÔºåÂ≠êÂ≠´‰∏çÊï¢Á®±Áî∞ÂßìÔºåÊïÖ‰ª•Ê≥ïÁÇ∫Ê∞è„ÄÇÂÆ£Â∏ùÊôÇÔºåÂæô‰∏âËºîÔºå‰∏ñÁÇ∫‰∫åÂçÉÁü≥„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 38.

Although Fa Zheng served as the Prefect () of Xindu County () and later as a Colonel Who Advises the Army () under Liu Zhang, he felt alienated because he neither held any important appointments nor made any significant achievements in his career under Liu Zhang. Besides, some of his fellows from Youfufeng, who had also moved to Yi Province, spoke ill of him in front of Liu Zhang. He maintained a close friendship with his colleague Zhang Song, who shared the same views as him about Liu Zhang being an incompetent and incapable governor.(Âª∫ÂÆâÂàùÔºåÂ§©‰∏ãÈ•ëËçíÔºåÊ≠£ËàáÂêåÈÉ°Â≠üÈÅî‰ø±ÂÖ•ËúÄ‰æùÂäâÁíãÔºå‰πÜ‰πãÁÇ∫Êñ∞ÈÉΩ‰ª§ÔºåÂæåÂè¨ÁΩ≤ËªçË≠∞Ê†°Â∞â„ÄÇÊó£‰∏ç‰ªªÁî®ÔºåÂèàÁÇ∫ÂÖ∂Â∑ûÈÇë‰ø±ÂÉëÂÆ¢ËÄÖÊâÄË¨óÁÑ°Ë°åÔºåÂøóÊÑè‰∏çÂæó„ÄÇÁõäÂ∑ûÂà•ÈßïÂºµÊùæËàáÊ≠£Áõ∏ÂñÑÔºåÂøñÁíã‰∏çË∂≥ËàáÊúâÁÇ∫ÔºåÂ∏∏Á´äÊ≠éÊÅØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 37.

Zhang Song travelled to Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to meet the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. After returning to Yi Province, Zhang Song advised Liu Zhang to break ties with Cao Cao and build friendly relations with another warlord, Liu Bei. When Zhang Song recommended Fa Zheng to be Liu Zhang's representative to meet Liu Bei, Fa initially refused to accept the task but eventually relented. When Fa Zheng returned from his mission, he told Zhang Song that Liu Bei had grand ambitions and persuaded Zhang to follow him to serve Liu Bei.(ÊùæÊñºËçäÂ∑ûË¶ãÊõπÂÖ¨ÈÇÑÔºåÂã∏ÁíãÁµïÊõπÂÖ¨ËÄåËá™ÁµêÂÖà‰∏ª„ÄÇÁíãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË™∞ÂèØ‰ΩøËÄÖÔºü„ÄçÊùæ‰πÉËàâÊ≠£ÔºåÊ≠£Ëæ≠ËÆìÔºå‰∏çÂæóÂ∑≤ËÄåÂæÄ„ÄÇÊ≠£Êó£ÈÇÑÔºåÁÇ∫ÊùæÁ®±Ë™™ÂÖà‰∏ªÊúâÈõÑÁï•ÔºåÂØÜË¨ÄÂçîË¶èÔºåÈ°òÂÖ±Êà¥Â•âÔºåËÄåÊú™ÊúâÁ∑£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 37. Their opportunity came in 211,Zizhi Tongjian vol. 66. when Liu Zhang became fearful upon receiving news that Cao Cao was planning to attack the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery. As Hanzhong Commandery was located strategically at the northern route leading into Yi Province, Liu Zhang would be in great peril if Hanzhong fell into Cao Cao's hands. Zhang Song proposed to Liu Zhang to invite Liu Bei to Yi Province to assist them in countering the threat posed by Cao Cao. Liu Zhang agreed and sent Fa Zheng as his envoy to contact Liu Bei. When Fa Zheng met Liu Bei, he secretly told him, \\"General, with your brilliance, you can overcome our incompetent and weak Governor Liu. Zhang Song, as a trusted adviser (of Liu Zhang), will serve as your spy. Upon acquiring Yi Province's wealth and resources, and having its natural barriers as protection, you can easily realise your grand ambitions.\\" Liu Bei accepted Fa Zheng's advice and led his forces into Yi Province, where he met Liu Zhang at Fu County (Ê∂™Á∏£; present-day Fucheng District, Mianyang, Sichuan).

He suggested that Liu Zhang adopt a scorched earth policy against Liu Bei by forcing the residents of Baxi () and Zitong () commanderies to relocate elsewhere and destroy all the granaries and supply depots in the commanderies, and then fortify their defences while avoiding direct conflict with Liu Bei. He claimed that if this strategy was implemented, Liu Bei would run out of supplies within 100 days and retreat, and then Liu Zhang could attack him while he was retreating. Liu Bei felt frustrated when he heard about Zheng Du's plan and consulted Fa Zheng about it. Fa Zheng predicted that Liu Zhang would not heed Zheng Du's suggestion and was proven right: In response to Zheng Du's plan, Liu Zhang not only rejected it on the grounds that it would cause disturbance to the people, but also dismissed Zheng from office.(ÈÑ≠Â∫¶Ë™™ÁíãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ∑¶Â∞áËªçÁ∏£ËªçË•≤ÊàëÔºåÂÖµ‰∏çÊªøËê¨ÔºåÂ£´Ë°ÜÊú™ÈôÑÔºåÈáéÁ©ÄÊòØË≥áÔºåËªçÁÑ°ËºúÈáç„ÄÇÂÖ∂Ë®àËé´Ëã•Áõ°È©ÖÂ∑¥Ë•ø„ÄÅÊ¢ìÊΩºÊ∞ëÂÖßÊ∂™Ê∞¥‰ª•Ë•øÔºåÂÖ∂ÂÄâÂª©ÈáéÁ©Ä‰∏ÄÁöÜÁáíÈô§ÔºåÈ´òÂ£òÊ∑±Ê∫ùÔºåÈùú‰ª•ÂæÖ‰πã„ÄÇÂΩºËá≥ÔºåË´ãÊà∞ÔºåÂãøË®±Ôºå‰πÜÁÑ°ÊâÄË≥áÔºå‰∏çÈÅéÁôæÊó•ÔºåÂøÖÂ∞áËá™Ëµ∞„ÄÇËµ∞ËÄåÊìä‰πãÔºåÂâáÂøÖÁ¶ΩËÄ≥„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖà‰∏ªËÅûËÄåÊÉ°‰πãÔºå‰ª•ÂïèÊ≠£„ÄÇÊ≠£Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁµÇ‰∏çËÉΩÁî®ÔºåÁÑ°ÂèØÊÜÇ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÁíãÊûúÂ¶ÇÊ≠£Ë®ÄÔºåË¨ÇÂÖ∂Áæ£‰∏ãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêæËÅûÊãíÊïµ‰ª•ÂÆâÊ∞ëÔºåÊú™ËÅûÂãïÊ∞ë‰ª•ÈÅøÊïµ‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÊñºÊòØÈªúÂ∫¶Ôºå‰∏çÁî®ÂÖ∂Ë®à„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 37.

Liu Zhang felt that he was already at the brink of destruction so he did not punish Xu Jing. He eventually surrendered and relinquished his control of Yi Province to Liu Bei. After taking over Yi Province, Liu Bei treated Xu Jing coldly because he felt that Xu was a disloyal person. Fa Zheng advised him, \\"Xu Jing is someone with an exaggerated reputation. However, my lord, you've recently built your foundation and you can't possibly explain the facts to everyone. Xu Jing's name is already well known throughout the Empire.

However, Zhuge Liang replied, \\"When our lord was in Gong'an, he was wary of Cao Cao's influence in the north and fearful of Sun Quan's presence in the east.

Fa Zheng and Zhuge Liang did not share the same moral beliefs but they had a good working relationship because of their common goal, which was to serve Liu Bei well. Zhuge Liang was very impressed with Fa Zheng's brilliance. In 221, before the Battle of Xiaoting, many of Liu Bei's subjects advised their lord against going to war with his former ally, Sun Quan, who seized Jing Province from Liu in 219 and executed Liu's general Guan Yu. Liu Bei ignored them and proceeded with his campaign against Sun Quan. In the following year, he lost to Sun Quan's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting and had to retreat to Baidicheng, where he died in 223. Zhuge Liang sighed, \\"If Fa Xiaozhi was still alive, he could have prevented our lord from going on this eastern campaign; even if our lord did go on this campaign, he wouldn't have ended up in this disastrous situation (if Fa Xiaozhi was with him).\\"(Ë´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆËàáÊ≠£ÔºåÈõñÂ•ΩÂ∞ö‰∏çÂêåÔºå‰ª•ÂÖ¨Áæ©Áõ∏Âèñ„ÄÇ‰∫ÆÊØèÂ•áÊ≠£Êô∫Ë°ì„ÄÇÂÖà‰∏ªÊó£Âç≥Â∞äËôüÔºåÂ∞áÊù±ÂæÅÂ≠´Ê¨ä‰ª•Âæ©ÈóúÁæΩ‰πãËÄªÔºåÁæ£Ëá£Â§öË´´Ôºå‰∏Ä‰∏çÂæû„ÄÇÁ´†Ê≠¶‰∫åÂπ¥ÔºåÂ§ßËªçÊïóÁ∏æÔºåÈÇÑ‰ΩèÁôΩÂ∏ù„ÄÇ‰∫ÆÊ≠éÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≥ïÂ≠ùÁõ¥Ëã•Âú®ÔºåÂâáËÉΩÂà∂‰∏ª‰∏äÔºå‰ª§‰∏çÊù±Ë°åÔºõÂ∞±Âæ©Êù±Ë°åÔºåÂøÖ‰∏çÂÇæÂç±Áü£„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 37. Zhuge Liang might be right about Fa Zheng, as inferred from an incident during the Hanzhong Campaign. During one battle, when the odds turned against Liu Bei, Liu's subjects urged their lord to retreat but he stubbornly refused. They did not dare to advise him again for fear of incurring his wrath. Fa Zheng rushed forth and stood in front of Liu Bei when Cao Cao's forces rained arrows on their camp. Liu Bei told Fa Zheng to stay under cover to avoid the arrows, but Fa insisted on braving the arrows with his lord. Liu Bei then decided to retreat together with Fa Zheng.(ÂÖà‰∏ªËàáÊõπÂÖ¨Áà≠ÔºåÂã¢Êúâ‰∏ç‰æøÔºåÂÆúÈÄÄÔºåËÄåÂÖà‰∏ªÂ§ßÊÄí‰∏çËÇØÈÄÄÔºåÁÑ°Êï¢Ë´´ËÄÖ„ÄÇÁü¢‰∏ãÂ¶ÇÈõ®ÔºåÊ≠£‰πÉÂæÄÁï∂ÂÖà‰∏ªÂâçÔºåÂÖà‰∏ª‰∫ëÔºö„ÄåÂ≠ùÁõ¥ÈÅøÁÆ≠„ÄÇ„ÄçÊ≠£Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊòéÂÖ¨Ë¶™Áï∂Áü¢Áü≥ÔºåÊ≥ÅÂ∞è‰∫∫‰πéÔºü„ÄçÂÖà‰∏ª‰πÉÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ≠ùÁõ¥ÔºåÂêæËàáÊ±ù‰ø±Âéª„ÄÇ„ÄçÈÅÇÈÄÄ„ÄÇ) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 37.

Laurence's brother Robert joined the business shortly thereafter. The Tisch brothers began to invest their profits in expanding the hotel business. By 1956, the brothers were in a position to build their first hotel, the Americana in Bal Harbour, Fla., for $17 million in cash.Rosenberg, Hilary. Like Fathers, Like Sons; As the Generations Shift, The Loews Style Remains. New York Times, 1999-05-30 In the wake of the landmark 1948 U.S. Supreme Court antitrust ruling, United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., all the major movie studios, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), were ordered to sell off the movie theater chains they owned and operated. New York City hotel developers Robert and Laurence Tisch purchased a controlling interest in Loew's Theatres, Inc. from MGM in 1959, a nationwide chain of 102 movie theaters, which formed the foundation of modern-day Loews, by the summer of 1960 they had gained control of the company; the brothers became co-chairmen. The Loew's theaters were aging and not suited to then-current movie-going trends which anticipated the multiplex; however, the theaters were located on highly valuable city property. Almost immediately the Tisch brothers began closing many of these theaters, demolishing them, hastening the end of the classic movie theater palaces from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and selling the vacant lots to developers. Loews sold the theater business in 1985. The two founders developed a conservative and flexible value-oriented philosophy which continues to be a cornerstone of Loews today. The Tisch brothers soon diversified the Loews business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas as the 1960s and 1970s progressed. Loews acquired Lorillard, a tobacco company, in 1968; CNA Financial in 1974, and the Bulova Watch Company in 1979. Through acquisitions, Loews' revenues grew from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion by a decade later. Laurence Tisch briefly owned, through Loews, a significant portion of U.S. television and radio broadcaster CBS in the 1980s.

They are a harmless benign tumour, containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, and have no relationship to cancer. They are the most common kind of angioma, and increase with age, occurring in nearly all adults over 30 years. Campbell de Morgan is the nineteenth-century British surgeon who first described them. Signs and symptoms Cherry hemangioma, H&E; stain Cherry angiomas are made up of clusters of capillaries at the surface of the skin, forming a small round dome (\\"papule\\"), which may be flat topped . They range in colour from bright red to purple. When they first develop, they may be only a tenth of a millimeter in diameter and almost flat, appearing as small red dots. However, they then usually grow to about one or two millimeters across, and sometimes to a centimeter or more in diameter . As they grow larger, they tend to expand in thickness, and may take on the raised and rounded shape of a dome. Multiple adjoining angiomas form a polypoid angioma. Because the blood vessels comprising an angioma are so close to the skin's surface, cherry angiomas may bleed profusely if they are injured. One study found that the majority of capillaries in cherry hemangiomas are fenestrated and stain for carbonic anhydrase activity. Cause Cherry angiomas appear spontaneously in many people in middle age but can also, less commonly, occur in young people. They can also occur in an aggressive eruptive manner in any age. The underlying cause for the development of cherry angiomas is not understood. Cherry angioma may occur through two different mechanisms: angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels), and vasculogenesis (the formation of totally new vessels, which usually occurs during embryonic and fetal development). One study published in 2010 found that a regulatory nucleic acid suppresses protein growth factors that cause vascular growth. This regulatory nucleic acid was lower in tissue samples of hemangiomas, and the growth factors were elevated, which suggests that the elevated growth factors may cause hemangiomas. The study found that the level of microRNA 424 is significantly reduced in senile hemangiomas compared to normal skin resulting in increased protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1. By inhibiting mir-424 in normal endothelial cells they could observe the same increased protein expression of MEK1 and cyclin E1 which, important for the development of senile hemangioma, induced cell proliferation of the endothelial cells. They also found that targeting MEK1 and cyclin E1 with small interfering RNA decreased the number of endothelial cells. A study published in 2019 identified that somatic mutations in GNAQ and GNA11 genes are present in many cherry angiomas. These specific missense mutations found in hemangiomas are also associated with port-wine stains and uveal melanoma. Chemicals and compounds that have been seen to cause cherry angiomas are mustard gas, 2-butoxyethanol, bromides, and cyclosporine. A significant increase in the density of mast cells has been seen in cherry hemangiomas compared with normal skin. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on the clinical appearance of the lesions. Examination with a dermatoscope shows characteristic red, purple, or blue-black lagoons. Treatment These lesions generally do not require treatment. If they are cosmetically unappealing or are subject to bleeding angiomas may be removed by electrocautery, a process of destroying the tissue by use of a small probe with an electric current running through it. Removal may cause scarring. More recently pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment has also been used. Future treatment based on a locally acting inhibitor of MEK1 and Cyclin E1 could possibly be an option. A natural MEK1 inhibitor is myricetin Prognosis In most patients, the number and size of cherry angiomas increases with advancing age. They are harmless, having no relation to cancer at all. Epidemiology Cherry angiomas occur in all races, ethnic backgrounds, and sexes.

Glaser Safety Slug is a frangible bullet made by Cor-Bon/Glaser, a subsidiary of Dakota Ammo, an American ammunition company based in Sturgis, South Dakota. The Glaser Safety Slug was developed by Jack Canon in 1975, the same year the company was founded by Armin Glaser. History The original round was a hand-made hollow point bullet filled with No. 12 birdshot (0.05\\") with a flat polymer cap. To improve ballistic performance, a polymer-tipped round ball was introduced in 1987, and the current compressed core form was first sold in 1988. The formulation of the polymer was also changed in 1994 to improve fragmentation reliability. Performance The company produces bullets in calibers from .25 to .45 for pistols and from .223 to .30-06 for rifles. Each caliber comes in two forms, \\"blue\\" and \\"silver\\", the latter having greater penetrating power due to the use of no. 6 birdshot rather than no. 12. The projectile in the cartridge is of a lighter weight than more conventional types of cartridges and so the projectiles exit the bore at significantly higher muzzle velocities. The current bullet has a stable core of compressed lead shot. On impact, the bullet fractures along manufactured stress lines in the jacket‚Äîimparting all the bullet's energy very quickly rather than over- penetrating a target or ricocheting on a miss. The light weight and fragility of the projectile make it unsuitable for long-range firing or against protected targets. The bullet design can produce deep wounds while failing to pass through structural barriers thicker than drywall or sheet metal. These qualities make it less likely to strike unintended targets, such as people in another room during an indoor shooting. Also, when it strikes a hard surface from which a solid bullet would glance off, it fragments into tiny, light pieces and creates much less ricochet danger.

At the time he was the youngest acting lieutenant colonel in the British Army. Background Keyes was the oldest son of Admiral of the Fleet Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes, a British naval hero of the First World War and the first Director of Combined Operations during the Second World War. He attended King's Mead School in Seaford, Sussex, then Eton and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Keyes was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Second World War =Early actions= Geoffrey Keyes was commissioned into the Royal Scots Greys. He saw action at Narvik and was later attached to No. 11 (Scottish) Commando, which was sent to the Middle East as part of Layforce. Following the allied invasion of Syria on 8 June 1941, No. 11 Commando was sent to successfully lead the crossing of the Litani River in Lebanon, fighting against troops of the French Vichy r√©gime, during which Keyes played a leading part. In this operation, Keyes earned the Military Cross. Following the action, 11 Commando returned to Cyprus, then to Egypt in August 1941, where the unit was left in limbo. Keyes, who had assumed command of the unit after his commanding officer, Colonel Richard Pedder, was killed during the Litani River offensive, was authorized to retain 110 volunteers as a troop in the Middle East Commando. =Operation Flipper= In October‚ÄìNovember 1941, a plan was formulated at Eighth Army headquarters to attack Axis headquarters, base installations and communications. One objective was the assassination by a Commando team of Erwin Rommel, the commander of the Axis forces in North Africa. The raid was intended to disrupt enemy organisation before the start of Operation Crusader. Operation Flipper was led by the acting Lieutenant Colonel Keyes with his superior, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Laycock, joining as an observer. Keyes, who had been present throughout the planning stage, selected the most hazardous task for himself: the assault on the supposed headquarters of the Afrika Korps in a house near Beda Littoria. Following a botched landing by submarine, where over half the raiding party and their equipment failed to get ashore, the men endured an exhausting approach in torrential rain. Keyes tried to enter the house but was confronted by a sentry. Keyes struggled in the doorway with the sentry until the guard was shot by his second-in-command. Surprise lost, Keyes, his second-in-command and a sergeant entered the building. Keyes felt faint and collapsed. Shortly after a confused period inside the house Keyes's body was carried outside by his men and left. The best explanation for this was that he was shot in the back by his second-in- command. The men retreated to a position from which they were later taken prisoner. The second-in-command also had to be left since he was shot in the leg by one of his own men. On Rommel's orders, Keyes was buried with full military honours in a local Catholic cemetery. It was later ascertained that the house was not Rommel's HQ but a supply center that he seldom if ever visited; he had been in Italy at the time of the attack. Despite the debacle, Keyes was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the citation read: Author Michael Asher has pointed out that Keyes' VC citation was written by an officer who was not an eye-witness (Robert Laycock), and is at odds with the accounts of the survivors of the raid, and with German accounts; according to Asher, there is scarcely any statement in the citation that is verifiably true.Michael Asher: Get Rommel, The Secret British Mission to Kill Hitler's Greatest General. 2004. Indeed, as author James Owen points out, the post- mortem conducted by the Germans showed that he had in fact been killed accidentally by one of his own men.James Owen. Commando. 2012. Asher's view is that the operation grew out of Keyes' desire to achieve the heroic status of his father, the World War I naval hero, Admiral Roger Keyes. \\"The Rommel Raid was born out of one man's ambition to achieve glory,\\" he has written,\\"and as so many times in British history, it was rescued from ignominy by the valour and determination of ordinary enlisted men, none of whom played a part in its planning, nor were even told the nature of their mission before they embarked.\\" Memorials Grave of Lieutenant-Colonel Geoffrey Charles Tasker Keyes, VC, MC (18 May 1917 ‚Äì 18 November 1941) Benghazi War Cemetery, Benghazi, Libya His body was later moved to Benghazi War Cemetery in Libya.

As founder and CEO of the Vancouver‚Äìarea based Paralink Group of Companies, Parasiuk organizes private sector/public sector partnerships in the export of Canada's health care, education and governmental expertise. Paralink also provides advice on energy development matters within Canada and internationally. In his early career as a politician, he was an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, Canada from 1977 to 1988, and a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley from 1981 to 1988.MLA Biographies - Living  Early life and education  Born in Stenen, Saskatchewan, Canada into a farming family, the son of William Peter Parasiuk and Lillian Gogal, he moved with his family to Transcona, a Winnipeg suburb when he was five. Parasiuk went on to obtain a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) and Master of Arts, Political Science and International Relations at the University of Manitoba and subsequently became a Rhodes Scholar (Manitoba 1966), studying at Oxford University (also playing for the University's ice hockey team in 1967 and 1968) and obtaining a Master of Arts at St.John's College. In 1967, Parasiuk married Wilma Dorothy Hewitson.  Early public career (1968-1988)  Parasiuk returned to Canada in 1968 and worked for the Canadian federal government's Department of Regional Economic Expansion as an Economic Development Planner in Ottawa, Ontario. In 1970, Parasiuk returned to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and began work with the Provincial Government of Manitoba. Appointed Assistant Deputy Minister for the Cabinet Planning Secretariat by then Premier Edward Schreyer, Parasiuk held several positions over the following years, including Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic and Resource Development, Chairman of the Lake Winnipeg Management Board, Chairman of Northern Manpower Corporation, Deputy Minister to the Premier and Deputy Minister to the Cabinet Planning Secretariat. From 1971 to 1977, Parasiuk was Chairman of the Leaf Rapids Development Corporation, Chairman of the Communities Economic Development Fund and Ex Officio Member of the Boards of Crown Corporations of the Government of Manitoba. Parasiuk led the development of the community of Leaf Rapids, Manitoba, which won former Governor General Vincent Massey's Award for Excellence in the Urban Environment in 1975, awarded by the Vincent Massey Foundation, the Canada Council and the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Parasiuk first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1973, losing to Progressive Conservative candidate Donald Craik by about 2,000 votes in the suburban Winnipeg riding of Riel. In the 1977 election, he was elected in his home riding, the traditional New Democratic Party stronghold of Transcona in east Winnipeg, even as the NDP government of Edward Schreyer was defeated by the Progressive Conservatives under Sterling Lyon. In 1979 Parasiuk went to China on a fact-finding tour led by prominent New Democrat, Tommy Douglas. This led to a lifelong interest and activities in an emerging China and the impact of this emergence on the rest of the world. Parasiuk remained neutral in the Manitoba NDP leadership race which ultimately elected Howard Pawley as party leader. Parasiuk was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, as Pawley's NDP won a majority government. Parasiuk had acted as the Co-Chairman of the election campaign with Eugene Kostyra. On November 30, 1981, Parasiuk was named Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for Manitoba Hydro, the Development Corporation Act, Manitoba Data Services and Manfor Resources Ltd. On January 20, 1982, he was also named Minister for Crown Investments. He was relieved of the DCA and MDS responsibilities on May 19, 1982, and the Crown Investments portfolio and the Manfor responsibility on November 4, 1983. As Minister Responsible for Manitoba Hydro, Parasiuk was instrumental in organizing an electricity export sales agreement with Northern States Power in Minnesota which led to the development of the Limestone hydro-electric dam and generating station in northern Manitoba. The dam development and its economic spin-offs had influence in the re-election of the Pawley government March 18, 1986. Parasiuk was easily re-elected in the 1986 provincial election. He resigned his portfolios on May 20, 1986 amid a conflict-of-interest allegation, but was reinstated on August 29, 1986 after his name was cleared by the Honourable Samuel Freedman, the retired Chief Justice of the Manitoba Court of Appeal. On September 21, 1987, he was appointed Minister of Health, with responsibility for Sport, the Boxing and Wrestling Commission Act and the Fitness and Amateur Sports Act. Parasiuk had not intended to run again in the next election, expected sometime in 1990. However, the 1988 election, brought on by the unexpected defeat of the government in the legislature, left Parasiuk no option but to run in his Transcona riding. During this election, Pawley resigned as leader and Parasiuk supported Gary Doer as Pawley's replacement. The NDP lost power in 1988 and Parasiuk himself was upset by Richard Kozak in the 1988 election, and has not sought a return to political life since then.  Private and public sector career and activities (1989-present)  Parasiuk moved from Winnipeg, Manitoba, to the Lower Mainland of British Columbia in 1989, accepting the position of founding President of Vancity Enterprises, a real estate investment and development subsidiary of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union. Under his leadership, Vancity Enterprises went through an innovative and successful start-up with award winning developments such as private residences providing assisted care at Queens Park Hospital, subsidized housing located over a Vancity Community branch and the Vancouver City Savings Credit Union Headquarters, constructed on previously unusable land due to the Skytrain rapid transit unit, which now passes through the building. In 1992, Parasiuk was hired by the government of then British Columbia Premier Michael Harcourt to work as Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the British Columbia Trade Development Corporation until he left in 1995. Parasiuk was an advocate of developing Vancouver as the gateway to Asia and focused on expanding trade and investment to and from Asia, especially China and India. He also pursued the expansion of the film industry in B.C. Parasiuk was the Director of Quorum Growth Inc., then a publicly traded venture capital company, from 1993 to 1997, Director of Quorum Growth International Ltd. from 1994 to 2000 and was named President of Quorum Funding International in 1995. From 1995 to 1997, Parasiuk was Chairman of the British Columbia International Power Group Inc. During his entire career, Parasiuk has been a board member for several private, non-profit and public organizations outside of his primary work activities. From 1989 to 1991, Parasiuk was a Director of the Canada West Foundation and in 1992 acted as Moderator for the B.C. Premier's Summit on Trade and Economic Opportunity. He was a member of the World Economic Forum from 1992‚Äì1995, as well as a member, from 1992 to 1998, of the Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on Government Restructuring (now the Advisory Committee on the Public Service) and Director of the Public Policy Forum during that time. Parasiuk has remained active in health-care policy research in Canada, having been a Director of Interhealth Canada Ltd. from 1994 to 2002 and Chairman of Interhealth Canada (China) Inc. from 1995 to 2003 and Chairman of the Beijing Toronto International Hospital Co-operative Joint Venture from 1996 to 2001, the first-ever private healthcare facility in Beijing, China. This project has not been completed due in large part to funding problems brought on by the East Asian financial crisis of the mid to late 1990s. In 1999, Parasiuk became the Managing Director of Interhealth Canada Limited Abu Dhabi, overseeing the start-up of the then Sheikh Khalifa Medical Center, a 335 bed, 1500 staff, accredited Western standard international hospital, now known as the Sheikh Khalifa Medical Pavilion, a central piece in the Sheikh Khalifa Medical City. When Parasiuk left Interhealth Canada Limited in 2002, he held the positions of Vice-Chairman of the Board, President and CEO. Since 1995, Parasiuk and his company, Paralink Management Ltd., have been involved in organizing private/public sector partnerships in the export of Canada's expertise with emphasis on Canada's healthcare, education and civics expertise. Paralink also provides advice on energy development matters. The Paralink group of companies are also involved in the recruitment and placement of foreign workers in Canada. Parasiuk has not remained active in partisan politics, although in 2003 he publicly supported Bill Blaikie's campaign to lead the federal New Democratic Party. Married since 1967 to Wilma Dorothy Parasiuk (n√©e Hewitson), also of Winnipeg, Manitoba, he has two children and resides in the Vancouver area.

History While some scattered items from the Bronze Age were discovered in Fisibach, the first evidence of a settlement is a Roman era watchtower along the Rhine River. The modern village of Fisibach is first mentioned in 1050 as Fusibach. The owners of Waldhausen Castle in the hamlet of Waldhausen, granted St. Blaise's Abbey extensive landholdings around their castle in 1113. However, by the 15th century, the castle was abandoned. On a rock in the Rhine was the Schwarzwasserstelz Castle. This castle, after 1363, was in the possession of the Bishop of Constance, and from 1589 to 1831 in the hands of the Tschudi family of Glarus. In 1875 it was demolished during the construction of the Rhine Valley Railway. The railroad did not have a station in Fisibach. The owner of Schwarzwasserstelz held the low court rights over Fisibach, while the Vogt of Baden held those rights in Waldhausen and H√§gelen.

It is the sequel to Klane's 1989 comedy Weekend at Bernie's. Andrew McCarthy, Jonathan Silverman and Terry Kiser reprise their roles. The film was panned by critics and was a modest success at the box office, grossing $12.7 million against a $7 million budget.  Plot  Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser). Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel (Barry Bostwick), the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the $2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu (Novella Nelson) is hired by mobsters to find the $2 million Bernie stole. She sends two servants‚ÄîHenry (Steve James) and Charles (Tom Wright)‚Äîto go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd Street‚ÄìGrand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. Later that night, Larry and Richard sneak into their office building to check Bernie's account, only to find that Bernie is the only one that can open it. They are soon arrested by the police for breaking and entering. After their release, they find Bernie (whom they believe is still dead), stuff him into a suitcase, bring him with them to the Virgin Islands, and put him into a small refrigerator in their hotel room. Unbeknownst to the two, Hummel is following them to recover the embezzled cash. The guys successfully use Bernie to open his safety deposit box but they only find a map. Meanwhile, Larry befriends a lovely native girl named Claudia (Troy Beyer), and gives her the map. Later, he and Richard are captured by Henry and Charles, who take them to Mobu. With one of the mobsters holding a gun to his head, she forces Richard to drink a poisonous concoction and tells them they must find the map by sundown to get the antidote. When Larry, Richard, and Claudia are reunited, they are shocked to discover that Bernie is moving and realize he is leading them towards the $2 million. To keep him moving, they put a Walkman with headphones on his head. As Bernie finds a large chest underwater they cheer, due to which Larry accidentally shoots Bernie in the head with an underwater speargun and destroys the headphones. They attempt to bring Bernie back to the surface but he will not let go of the chest, which is too heavy to hoist out of the water. They end up attaching Bernie to a horse carriage with music playing. It seems to work at first, but when they go downhill, the carriage goes out of control. Eventually, the carriage ends up at Mobu's place. Bernie hits a large tree branch and spins into a somersault before knocking out Mobu. The crash also causes Bernie to drop the chest on the ground and it breaks open. Larry tries to scoop up the money but is caught by Hummel (now slightly unhinged upon seeing the undead Bernie walk) and he relinquishes the $2 million to him. With Mobu out of commission, Claudia's father, a medical doctor, says that he can cure Richard if he can get the blood of a virgin (which Larry confesses he can provide). The mobsters and Mobu are arrested, and Bernie is last seen leading Henry and Charles, who have been transformed into goats by voodoo, in a carnival parade. Larry confesses to Richard that he returned the $2 million to the insurance company, but only after learning Bernie actually stole $3 million. Larry and Richard use some of the remaining million to purchase a yacht crewed by attractive women.

The cast and crew, who were mainly from the Los Angeles area, were on location when the Los Angeles riots of April 1992 broke out and they stated in a St. Thomas interview that they were worried for their loved ones. The Bernie dummy used in the film had been on display for the film's debut shortly before the riot's outbreak, and was robbed of its painter's hat and $400 sunglasses.TV Guide, May 11th, 1992  Reception  Weekend at Bernie's II earned mostly negative reviews from critics, earning a 10% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 29 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"It would appear to be all but impossible to make a worthwhile sequel to a comedy about a corpse's exploits ‚Äì odds Weekend at Bernie's II never comes close to beating.\\" Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"C+\\" on scale of A+ to F. Hal Hinson of the Washington Post wrote: \\"If the premise of the first film was mindless and repetitive, it's doubly so this second time around.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave it a grade \\"F\\". David Rooney of Variety called it \\"a mildly diverting farcical caper.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film 3 out of 5 and praised Terry Kiser for his performance: \\"Through it all, Mr. Kiser, who says not a word, exudes the foolish amiability of a partygoer who is beyond plotzed and is living in a private world of his own.\\" =Box office= The movie had modest box office success, grossing $12,741,891 in the US and Canada.  In popular culture  Weekend at Bernie's II is mentioned in the eighth season episode of Seinfeld, \\"The Comeback\\". The movie is featured in the staff picks shelf at a video rental store, under \\"Gene's Picks\\". Kramer recommends it to Elaine (as \\"a hilarious premise\\") instead of a staff pick by \\"arthouse goon\\" Vincent. Elaine rents it, only to be disappointed and eventually yell \\"Bernie's dead, you morons!\\" at the television while watching it. Similarly, in an episode of NCIS a character who needs to establish an alibi is too embarrassed to say which film he had been watching. The team assume he was watching a porn film, but he eventually admits it was Weekend at Bernie's II, to which film geek Agent DiNozzo says, \\"Even worse.\\"NCIS, season 3, episode 13 - Deception, January 17, 2006.

Activities during the First Republic In the newly independent state (First Republic of Czechoslovakia), Chvalkovsk√Ω first became a secretary of interior minister Anton√≠n ≈†vehla. In 1920, he joined the diplomatic service and participated in the negotiations of the Treaty of Trianon. He later served as ambassador to Japan, the United States, Germany and Italy. After Munich Agreement First Vienna Award: Franti≈°ek Chvalkovsk√Ω, Galeazzo Ciano, Joachim von Ribbentrop, K√°lm√°n K√°nyaThe Munich Agreement ended the First Republic of Czechoslovakia. Its previous pro- democratic and anti-totalitarian policies gave way to calls for authoritarian government and closer cooperation with Nazi Germany (more: Second Czechoslovak Republic). The political elite, connected with former President Edvard Bene≈°, had to leave office and Chvalkovsk√Ω became foreign minister. He tried to maintain the independence of the rump state by making concessions to neighbours, hoping to gain time for a more favorable outcome in the future. He grossly underestimated Hitler's desire to occupy Central Europe and the hunger for revenge from Poland and Hungary, who had been forced to make painful concessions to Czechoslovakia after World War I. He represented Czechoslovakia during the Vienna Arbitration. Due to insufficient preparation, Czechoslovakia had to concede significant parts of Slovak territory to Hungary. When Slovakia declared independence on 14 March 1939, Chvalkovsk√Ω traveled with President Emil H√°cha to Berlin, hoping that further concessions would preserve the independence of Czech lands. Under Nazi rule With the establishment of the Protectorate, there was no official place for the Czech diplomatic service. As a last ruling, under German pressure, the Foreign Ministry ordered all Czechoslovak ambassadors to close their embassies and to transfer them to the Germans. Patriotic clerks hoped that the ambassadors, free from direct Nazi pressure, would disobey the order and keep the embassies for the future benefit of the government-in-exile. As a last resort, if the host government were hostile to them, they should transfer their embassy to the host government, rather than Germany. However, many ambassadors did not read between the lines and obeyed the order literally, as they usually did, causing significant damage to Czechoslovak interests. Given the sequence of events shaped by Chvalkovsk√Ω, many countries, such as France, a signatory of the Munich Agreement, initially considered the fall of Czechoslovakia a result of internal forces, rather than German aggression. Chvalkovsk√Ω thus caused considerable damage to Czechoslovakia during this critical period. After the Foreign Ministry was closed in 1939, Chvalkovsk√Ω became an envoy of the Protectorate in Germany. He was killed on a highway outside Berlin during an Allied Air raid, strafed by a low-flying aircraft.Hamburger Zeitung, 28 March 1945 The German High Command reported British strafing attacks near Berlin on that day.OKW Bericht for 25 February 1945 References External links * Franti≈°ek Chvalkovsk√Ω's biography on the web site of Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs In Czech. * History of Czech diplomats in Germany In German. * Franti≈°ek Chvalkovsk√Ω's last days in the Third Reich In English with links to German documents. * 1885 births 1945 deaths People from J√≠lov√© u Prahy People from the Kingdom of Bohemia Foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia Government ministers of Czechoslovakia Ambassadors of Czechoslovakia to Japan Ambassadors of Czechoslovakia to the United States Ambassadors of Czechoslovakia to Germany Ambassadors of Czechoslovakia to Italy Deaths by airstrike during World War II ","title":"Franti≈°ek Chvalkovsk√Ω"},{"id":"1213334","text":"Colonel Edward Douglas Browne-Synge-Hutchinson, (6 March 1861 ‚Äì 3 March 1940) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Phillips (born November 1942) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988, and served as speaker of the assembly from 1986 to 1988. Phillips was born in Roland, Manitoba. Before entering politics, she was active in feminist organizations such as the Equal Rights and Opportunities Commission, and in community programs such as Place for Kids Daycare. She was also a member of the Wolseley Residents's Association in central Winnipeg. Phillips worked for the provincial government from 1974 to 1981, also working for Great West Life and the Manitoba Telephone System. She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Len Domino by 1,468 votes in the Wolseley constituency. The NDP won a majority government in this election, and Phillips served in the assembly as a backbench supporter of Howard Pawley's administration. She was easily re-elected in the 1986 election. On May 8, 1986, Pawley appointed Phillips as speaker of the legislature. The previous speaker, Jim Walding, had become unpopular with his own party in 1984, when he allowed the opposition Progressive Conservatives to delay passage of a bill entrenching French language rights in Manitoba. The PCs boycotted house proceedings for several weeks, and Walding refused to call the house to order for a vote. Many questioned the validity of his actions. The Progressive Conservatives supported Walding, and refused to co-nominate Phillips as his successor. Phillips generally avoided the controversies of her predecessor, although she was once criticized for attending an NDP caucus meeting during her tenure as speaker. The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in early 1988, when Jim Walding voted against his party's budget in an evenly divided house. A new election was held, which the NDP lost. Phillips was personally defeated in Wolseley, losing to Manitoba Liberal Party candidate Harold Taylor by 506 votes. After leaving politics, Phillips worked with the National Democratic Institute in Palestine. She also returned to work in the provincial civil service, retiring in 2001. She endorsed Kristine Barr for the Wolseley NDP nomination in the 2003 provincial election. In August 2012, Phillips was named to the Manitoba Law Reform Commission.

The name \\"Spryfield\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the general area of Halifax's South Mainland, which includes a number of communities along the Herring Cove and Purcell's Cove Roads. History The land now known as Spryfield was first occupied by the Mi'kmaq people, who hunted and fished at Beaver Lake (now called Long Lake). The Mi'kmaq would later help the first Europeans in settling upon their arrival by the mid-18th century.We are Spryfield. (2006) Captain William Spry Community Centre, 6. Retrieved July 22, 2008, from http://www.anccommunity.ca/Downloads/Spryfield_community_profile_2006.pdf The community gets its name from Captain Lieutenant-General William Spry, who purchased land in the area in 1769. Originally known as Spry's Field, the town is centred on Spry's former estate. The availability of land suitable for farming, and the relative close proximity to the Halifax market attracted the European settlers. These included the Drysdale, Kidston, Brunt, Connors, Henneberry, Moor, Norris, Sutherland, Warner, Findlay, Umlah, Yeadon, Oakley, and McInnis families, many of whom still reside in the community today. Of particular note was Henry Lieblin, a Halifax baker who held of land by the latter 18th century. A large development begun in the early 1950s, Lieblin Park, was named in his honor. Lieblin's farm was about where Elmsdale Crescent is today. Spryfield's first public school opened in 1859. Its teacher, Elizabeth Sutherland, taught the town's early residents. In 1958, Elizabeth Sutherland Memorial School opened in her honour.Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management. (1967) Place-Names and Places of Nova Scotia. Public Archives of Nova Scotia, 641-643. Retrieved June 30, 2008, from http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/cap/places/page.asp?ID=641 Until 1968, Spryfield was a part of Halifax County. It voted to become a part of the City of Halifax in that year, via a general referendum. Geography Strictly speaking, Spryfield \\"proper\\" is bounded to the north by Armdale, to the south by Long Pond and to the east by the Purcell's Cove Road. The major roads are # Herring Cove Road, off of which all other roads in Spryfield branch either primarily or secondarily, # William's Lake Road, which connects Herring Cove and Purcell's Cove Roads, # Old Sambro Road, which leads to Harrietsfield, Williamswood, then Sambro and # the Northwest Arm Drive, which connects Old Sambro Road to the St. Margaret's Bay Rd., Clayton Park and Highway 102. The Northwest Arm Drive permits one to bypass the Armdale Rotary, which would otherwise be the only exit from the Mainland South area of the Halifax Regional Metropolitan (HRM) area. The community =Recreation= Spryfield has numerous lakes of various sizes for swimming and non-motorized boating in the summer months. There is also a public pool in the middle of the community at the Captain William Spry Community Centre, which is built on the site of the former West School. The Centre also contains a library, community service offices and meeting rooms available to the general public. There are baseball and soccer fields, basketball and tennis courts, a skate park (next to the library) and a skating rink (next to J.L. Ilsley High School), and the school gyms are often available for community use as well. In addition, the community is home to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Halifax, which offers programs to children and youth year-round. For those interested in gardening, there is a community gardening operation near Thornhill Park, on part of what was once the old Kidston farm. A masonic lodge, Duke of Kent 121, also meets in Spryfield, on the border with Long Pond. Spryfield is surrounded by forested areas, and in addition to the lakes there are numerous opportunities for hiking, berry-picking and exploring. =Schools and services= To service the continuing development of subdivisions, apartment complexes and homes, there are schools located in Spryfield for all ages. This includes day cares, elementary schools, junior high schools, and one high school (J. L. Ilsley High School). Children may attend French immersion or English speaking classes starting in elementary school. Spryfield is also home to Chebucto Connections, a local non-profit organization that works with the community to organize programs, services and research that can help address priorities and interests that the local community has identified as important. In 2010, they brought Pathways to Education to the community to address concerns about high drop-out rates from high school. As of September 2013, it was serving 280 Spryfield students in grades 9 to 12. Chebucto Connections also works in partnership with IWK, CDHA, and a wide number of other non-profit organizations and acts as a connector that brings people, agencies, services and government together. Public sector services are well represented in or near the community, with a Halifax Regional Police Community Office, fire stations, a complete selection of schools, and community service offices at the Captain William Spry Center and the Spryfield Mall. Provincial governmental services are available at numerous locations nearby, including the Halifax Shopping Center. Since Halifax is the capital (and largest city) of the province, provincial and federal services are well represented in area, especially in the downtown district which is a 20-minute drive from Spryfield. Businesses and industry Until approximately 1960, there was relatively (i.e., compared to overall population density) more business and industrial activity in the Spryfield area than subsequently. At the intersection of Dentith Road and Herring Cove Roads, for example, a hotel existed. There were farms in many portions of the community until the early 1950s, such as the Umlah Farm just south of Long Lake, and the Kidston farm near what is now Thornhill Park. Most of Spryfield has been logged at least once, and the last logging and sawmill operation existed on the east side of Kidston Lake until the mid-1960s. Gravel and aggregate pits such as the operation to the south of Elizabeth Sutherland Memorial School (now a fine baseball diamond), helped provide material for building local roads until the late 1950s, and in the early part of the 20th century there was a granite quarrying operation in what is now the northern portion of Long Lake Provincial Park. Much of this granite can still be seen in historic buildings and walls in downtown Halifax. In the 1960s and 1970s, many people began to travel to the Halifax downtown area and later on, to the shopping centers and malls in the region to do their purchasing, and the community took on a \\"bedroom community\\" aspect: the great majority of the residents work elsewhere, with relatively few local thriving local businesses. The establishment of the Spryfield Mall in the mid-1970s was an attempt to reverse this trend, but it has struggled to fill its floorspace in recent years. However, there is still a vigorous and growing business community in the Spryfield area, with a good amount of recent development occurring. 2009 forest fire Spryfield has a history of large forest fires, which in more recent decades seems to have peaked in the 1960s, when a number of large fires burned a significant proportion of the forests in the area. The largest Spryfield fire of the 21st century began on April 30, 2009 when a forest fire erupted in the afternoon in the Green Acres area, forcing as many as 1,000 people to flee their homes. As many as 12 houses were destroyed and an area of approximately 800 hectares burned, between the Herring Cove and Purcell's Cove Roads: the fire travelled quickly between these major highways but did not cross either of them. The cause was not determined but dead wood from trees downed during Hurricane Juan fueled the blaze. Firefighters from Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency and the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources fought the fire.Spryfield Fire CBC News Schools * J. L.

Developments Initially, Spryfield mainly consisted of homes and roads off of the three main roads mentioned above. However, after World War II developers began to build subdivisions to accommodate some of the many new residents of the still rapidly growing greater Halifax region as well as the Baby Boomer generation. These now contain the majority of the community's residents. Leiblin Park and Thornhill Park were among the first, being built from 1955 to 1965. Later developments include Elgin subdivision, Green Acres (which was left unfinished), Cowie Hill, the Greystone (formerly Carson St.) subdivision, three subdivisions off of William Lake Road, a modest co-op development by the Macintosh Runs across from B.C. Silver Junior High School, and a large development in the Colepitt's Lake barrens area which as of 2009 is about halfway completed. Initially, these were single-family dwellings, but higher densities began to be achieved by the late 1970s, when the Cowie Hill subdivision was built with mostly townhouses and two large apartment buildings. Greystone is mostly row houses, and there are now a number of apartment building complexes in the area, such as the one off of River Road, facing J.L.

It forms part of Greatest Hits Radio North West  History  = Early years = The station began broadcasting at 5am on Tuesday 2 April 1974 as Piccadilly Radio on 261 m (1151 kHz then) AM/MW and on 97.0 MHz FM (from the same transmitter in Saddleworth that is now used by Hits Radio Manchester). The station was named after Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester, and Piccadilly Plaza was home to the station's first studios until 1996, when Piccadilly 1152 and Hits Radio were relocated to the Castlefield area of Manchester. Piccadilly's founding managing director was Philip Birch, who previously ran the highly influential pirate station Radio London until it closed down ahead of the Marine Offences Act in August 1967. The first presenter on air was Roger Day ‚Äì himself an ex-pirate radio presenter ‚Äì and the first song played on air was Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys. Many of Britain's best-known broadcasters started their careers at Piccadilly, including Chris Evans, Mike Sweeney, Steve Penk, James H Reeve, Andy Peebles, Gary Davies, Tim Grundy, Timmy Mallett, Pete Mitchell, Geoff Lloyd, Mark Radcliffe, James Stannage, Stu Allan, Nick Robinson and Karl Pilkington. Journalist Paul Lockitt joined Piccadilly in 1979 and became the station's longest serving on-air employee, working as a producer, presenter and newscaster until his departure in 2017. = FM/MW split = Piccadilly Radio split into two services in 1988, with Key 103 broadcast on FM with a contemporary music format, while Piccadilly continued on AM, initially under its full service format, gradually adopting a 'golden oldies' music playlist as Piccadilly Gold. In the mid-1990s, Piccadilly Gold became Piccadilly 1152 as the playlist moved away from \\"golden oldies\\" to a mix of classic and current easy-listening music. The late-night phone-in with James Stannage became the most popular radio talk show outside London, whilst the Dave Ward and Umberto breakfast show helped the station to become one of the biggest AM stations. In 1994, a rival station, Fortune 1458 (later renamed 1458 Lite AM, today broadcasting as 1458 Capital Gold) commenced on BBC GMR's former AM frequency. Despite heavy marketing, and many ex-Piccadilly presenters on the new station, Piccadilly 1152 remained Manchester's most popular station, other than sister station Key 103, until the late 1990s when smaller, localised FM stations in Oldham, Warrington and Bury began to erode away Piccadilly's audience base. = Magic 1152 = In 1994, Piccadilly (Key 103/Piccadilly 1152) were part of the Transworld Radio Group, which was bought by present owners Bauer Radio (then EMAP). In 1999/2000, parent company EMAP re-branded the station as Magic 1152, to fall in-line with the other nine Magic stations they owned across London and the north of England. The idea of a \\"Magic brand\\" of stations was seen to be beneficial when selling air time to national advertisers. This change in name also coincided with the 25th birthday of Piccadilly Radio. The station was branded as \\"Piccadilly 1152 ‚Äì the magic of Manchester\\" during the transition. Except for a short spell in 2000 ‚Äì when Key 103 was briefly renamed Piccadilly Key 103 ‚Äì the Piccadilly brand was finally retired. In December 2001, EMAP decided that it was more economical for the Magic network to share off-peak programmes. Magic 1152, in line with the other seven Magic AM stations in northern England, began networking 10am2pm, and 7pm6am by carrying programming from Magic 105.4 in London. During these hours, it was simply known as Magic, although there were local commercial breaks, and local news on the hour. In January 2003, after a sharp decline in listening, the station ceased networking with the London station, and a regional northern network was created with the Manchester station providing networked output at weekends while sister station Magic 1152 in Newcastle provided weekday programming.

Other common names are \\"shadberries\\" (as their blossoming coincides with the shad runs in New England), \\"Juneberries\\" (because the berries usually set on in June), and \\"Service\\" or \\"Sarvice\\" berries because their blooms mean that the muddy back roads into the \\"coves and hollers\\" of Appalachia will soon be passable for circuit-riding preachers and the communities will be able to have Sunday services again. (Some say, more morbidly, that it means the ground is soft enough to dig, which means that those who died over winter can be buried and have services said over them.) Amelanchier arborea is generally tall. Occasionally, it can grow up to tall and reach into the overstory. The trunk can be up to in diameter (rarely to ). The bark is smooth and gray. The buds are slender with a pointed tip, and usually more than two scales visible. The leaves are ovate or elliptical, , rarely , long and wide, with pointed tips and finely serrated margins. A characteristic useful for identification is that the young leaves emerge downy on the underside. The fall color is variable, from orange-yellow to pinkish or reddish. Flower details It has perfect flowers that are in diameter, with 5 petals, emerging during budbreak in early spring. The petals are white. Flowers are produced on pendulous racemes long with 4-10 flowers on each raceme. The flowers are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a reddish-purple pome, resembling a small apple in shape. They ripen in summer and are very popular with birds.Bioimages: Amelanchier arborea images It also commonly hybridizes with other species of Amelanchier, the hybrid Amelanchier √ó grandiflora being one example, and identification can be very difficult as a result. Cultivation This species tolerates varying light levels, but is at its best in full sun. It requires good drainage and air circulation and should be watered during drought. It is often confused with other species in the nursery trade. Propagation is by seed, divisions and grafting. The edible fruit is drier than some other serviceberries, and it is harvested locally for pies and jams, and has been known to be used for wine; they were also used by Native Americans to make bread. Some report that the sweetened juice tastes like Dr. Pepper and some nurseries sell them as \\"The Dr. Pepper Tree\\", but the fruit is not used in the soft drink.

As a social construct, reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self- interest model; conversely, in response to hostile actions they are frequently much more nasty and even brutal. Reciprocity makes it possible to build continuing relationships and exchanges. Fukuyama states that ‚ÄúIf the institutions of democracy and capitalism are to work properly, they must coexist within certain premodern cultural habits that ensure their proper functioning‚Äù (p. 11). He goes on to say ‚ÄúLaw, contract, and economic rationality and prosperity‚Ä¶. must as well be leavened with reciprocity, moral obligation, duty toward community, and trust‚Ä¶. The latter are not anachronisms in a modern society but rather the sine qua non of the latter‚Äôs success‚Äù (p. 11) According to the sociologist Alvin Gouldner (1960), this norm is nearly universal, and only a few members of society‚Äîthe very young, the sick, or the old‚Äîare exempt from it. Reciprocal actions differ from altruistic actions in that reciprocal actions only follow from others' initial actions, while altruism is the unconditional act of social gift-giving without any hope or expectation of future positive responses. Some distinguish between ideal altruism (giving with no expectation of future reward) and reciprocal altruism (giving with limited expectation or the potential for expectation of future reward). For more information on this idea, see altruism or altruism (ethics).  History  Reciprocity dates as far back as the time of Hammurabi (c. 1792‚Äì1750 BC). Hammurabi's code, a collection of 282 laws and standards, lists crimes and their various punishments as well as guidelines for citizens' conduct. The code was formalized example that demanded the individual act in terms of the public interest. The \\"eye for an eye\\" principles in which the laws were written mirror the idea of direct reciprocity. For example, if a person caused the death of another person, the killer would be put to death: Law #196: \\"If a man destroy the eye of another man, they shall destroy his eye. If one break a man's bone, they shall break his bone. If one destroy the eye of a freeman or break the bone of a freeman he shall pay one gold mina. If one destroy the eye of a man's slave or break a bone of a man's slave he shall pay one-half his price.\\" Reciprocity was also a cornerstone of ancient Greece. In Homeric Greece, citizens relied on reciprocity as a form of transaction as there was no formal system of government or trade. In Homer's Iliad, he illustrates several instances of reciprocal transactions in the form of gift giving. For example, in Book VI of the Iliad, Glaucus and Diomedes exchange armor when they discover that their grandfathers were friends. However, there were times when direct reciprocity was not possible, specifically in times of great need when a citizen had nothing to give for repayment. Thus, deferred reciprocity was also prevalent in Greek culture at this time. Deferred reciprocity refers to giving a person gifts or favors with the understanding that they will repay this favor at another time when the initial giver is in great need. This form of reciprocity was used extensively by travelers, particularly in the Odyssey. Odysseus often had to rely on the kindness of human strangers and other mythological creatures to secure resources along his journey. In the classical Greek polis, large-scale projects such as construction of temples, building of warships and financing of choruses were carried out as gifts to individual donors. In Rome, wealthy elite were linked with their dependents in a cycle of reciprocal gift giving. As these examples suggest, reciprocity enjoyed a cultural prestige among ancient aristocracies for whom it was advantageous.  An adaptive mechanism  Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin attribute the very nature of humans to reciprocity. They claim humans survived because our ancestors learned to share goods and services \\"in an honored network of obligation\\". Thus, the idea that humans are indebted to repay gifts and favors is a unique aspect of human culture. Cultural anthropologists support this idea in what they call the \\"web of indebtedness\\" where reciprocity is viewed as an adaptive mechanism to enhance survival. Within this approach, reciprocity creates an interdependent environment where labor is divided so that humans may be more efficient. For example, if one member of the group cares for the children while another member hunts for food for the group, each member has provided a service and received one in return. Each member can devote more time and attention to his or her allotted task and the whole group benefits. This meant that individuals could give away resources without actually giving them away. Through the rule of reciprocity, sophisticated systems of aid and trade were possible bringing immense benefits to the societies that utilized them. Given the benefits of reciprocity at the societal level, it is not surprising that the norm has persisted and dictates our present cognition and behavior.  The power of reciprocity  Reciprocity is not only a strong determining factor of human behavior; it is a powerful method for gaining one's compliance with a request. The rule of reciprocity has the power to trigger feelings of indebtedness even when faced with an uninvited favor and irrespective of liking the person who executed the favor. In 1971, Dennis Regan tested the strength of these two aspects of reciprocity in a study where participants believed they were in an art appreciation experiment with a partner, Joe, who was really Regan's assistant. During the experiment, Joe would disappear and bring back a soft drink for the participant. After this phase of the experiment was over, Joe would ask the participant to buy raffle tickets from him. The more the participants liked Joe, the more likely they were to buy raffle tickets from him. However, when Joe had given them a soda and thus indebted them to reciprocate, it made no difference whether the participants liked Joe or not, the rule of reciprocity overpowered liking. Thus, individuals who we might not even like have the power to greatly increase our chances of doing them a favor simply by providing us with a small gift or favor prior to their request. Furthermore, we are obliged to receive these gifts and favors which reduces our ability to choose to whom we wish to be indebted. In 1976, Phillip Kunz demonstrated the automatic nature of reciprocity in an experiment using Christmas cards. In this experiment, Kunz sent out holiday cards with pictures of his family and a brief note to a group of complete strangers. While he expected some reaction, holiday cards came pouring back to him from people who had never met nor heard of him and who expressed no desire to get to know him any better. The majority of these individuals who responded never inquired into Kunz's identity, they were merely responding to his initial gesture with a reciprocal action. Politics is another area where the power of reciprocity is evident. While politicians often claim autonomy from the feelings of obligation associated with gifts and favors that influence everyone else, they are also susceptible. In the 2002 election, U.S. Congress Representatives who received the most money from special interest groups were over seven times more likely to vote in favor of the group that had contributed the most money to their campaigns. Fehr and G√§chter (2000) showed that, when acting within reciprocal frameworks, individuals are more likely to deviate from purely self-interested behavior than when acting in other social contexts. Magnanimity is often repaid with disproportionate amounts of kindness and cooperation, and treachery with disproportionate amounts of hostility and vengeance, which can significantly surpass amounts determined or predicted by conventional economic models of rational self-interest. Moreover, reciprocal tendencies are frequently observed in situations wherein transaction costs associated with specific reciprocal actions are high and present or future material rewards are not expected. Whether self-interested or reciprocal action dominates the aggregate outcome is particularly dependent on context; in markets or market-like scenarios characterized by competitiveness and incomplete contracts, reciprocity tends to win out over self-interest. = Positive and negative reciprocity = Positive reciprocity occurs when an action committed by one individual that has a positive effect on someone else is returned with an action that has an approximately equal positive effect. For example, if someone takes care of another person's dog, the person who received this favor should then return this action with another favor such as with a small gift. However, the reciprocated action should be approximately equal to the first action in terms of positive value, otherwise this can result in an uncomfortable social situation. If someone takes care of another person's dog and that person returns the favor by buying that individual a car, the reciprocated gift is inappropriate because it does not equal the initial gesture. Individuals expect actions to be reciprocated by actions that are approximately equal in value. One example of positive reciprocity is that waitresses who smile broadly receive more tips than waitresses who present a minimal smile. Also, free samples are not merely opportunities to taste a product but rather invitations to engage in the rule of reciprocity. Many people find it difficult to accept the free sample and walk away. Instead, they buy some of the product even when they did not find it that enjoyable. Negative reciprocity occurs when an action that has a negative effect on someone is returned with an action that has an approximately equal negative effect. For example, if an individual commits a violent act against a person, it is expected that person would return with a similar act of violence. If, however, the reaction to the initial negative action is not approximately equal in negative value, this violates the norm of reciprocity and what is prescribed as allowable. Retaliatory aspects i.e. the aspects of trying to get back and cause harm, are known as negative reciprocity. This definition of negative reciprocity is distinct from the way negative reciprocity is defined in other domains. In cultural anthropology, negative reciprocity refers to an attempt to get something for nothing. It is often referred to as \\"bartering\\" or \\"haggling\\" (see reciprocity (cultural anthropology) for more information).  Reciprocal concessions  There are more subtle ways of initiating the reciprocity rule than merely doing something nice for someone so you may expect something in return. One form of this more subtle form of reciprocity is the idea of reciprocal concessions in which the requester lowers his/her initial request, making the respondent more likely to agree to a second request. Under the rule of reciprocity, we are obligated to concede to someone who has made a concession to us. That is, if an individual starts off by requesting something large and you refuse, you feel obligated to consent to their smaller request even though you might not be interested in either of the things they are offering. Robert Cialdini illustrates an example of this phenomenon by telling a story of a boy who asks him to buy five-dollar circus tickets and, when Cialdini refuses, asks him to buy some one dollar chocolate bars. Cialdini feels obligated to return the favor and consents to buying some of the chocolate bars. The rule of reciprocity operates in reciprocal concessions in two ways. First, an individual is pressured to reciprocate one concession for another by nature of the rule itself. Second, because the individual who initially concedes can expect to have the other person concede in return, this person is free to make the concession in the first place. If there were no social pressure to return the concession, an individual runs the risk of giving up something and getting nothing in return. Mutual concession is a procedure that can promote compromise in a group so that individuals can refocus their efforts toward achieving a common goal. Reciprocal concessions promote compromise in a group so that the initial and incompatible desires of individuals can be set aside for the benefit of social cooperation. = The door in the face technique = The door in the face technique, otherwise known as the rejection-then-retreat technique, involves making an outrageous request that someone will almost certainly turn down, and then make the smaller request that was the favor of interest all along. If done skillfully, the second request is seen as a concession so compliance with the second request is obtained. However, one must proceed with caution when using this technique. If the first request is so big that it is seen as unreasonable, the door in the face technique proves useless as the concession made after is not perceived as genuine. The door in the face technique is not to be confused with the foot in the door technique where individuals getting a person to agree with a large request by first getting them to agree to a moderate request.

He is one of the most influential and controversial personalities in the development of modern Mexico. His philosophy of the \\"cosmic race\\" affected all aspects of Mexican sociocultural, political, and economic policies. Early life Vasconcelos was born in Oaxaca, Oaxaca, on February 28, 1882, the son of a customs official.Krauze, Redeemers; p. 53 Jos√©'s mother, a pious Catholic, died when Jos√© was 16. The family moved to the border town of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, where he grew up attending school in Eagle Pass, Texas.Krauze, Redeemers, p. 53> He became bilingual in English and Spanish,Krauze, Redeemers, p. 53 which opened doors to the English-speaking world. The family also lived in Campeche while the northern border area was unstable. His time in living on the Texas border likely contributed to fostering his idea of the Mexican \\"cosmic race\\" and rejection of Anglo culture. Private life At 24, he married Serafina Miranda of Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, in 1906. Their children were Jos√© Ignacio and Carmen. He also had a long-term relationship with Elena Arizmendi Mejia and throughout his life many other shorter liaisons, including one with Berta Singerman.Krauze, Redeemers, pp. 55, 67. His troubled relationship with Antonieta Rivas Mercado led to her suicide inside Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral in 1931. When his wife of forty years died in 1942, their daughter Carmen is reported to have said, \\"When the coffin was lowered into the ground, Vasconcelos sobbed bitterly. At that moment he must have known and felt who he really had as a wife; perhaps they were tears of belated repentance.\\"quoted in Krauze, Redeemers, p. 84. He remarried the pianist Esperanza Cruz and they had a child, H√©ctor.Krauze, Redeemers, p. 84. Mexican Revolution Jos√© Vasconcelos Although Vasconcelos was interested in studying philosophy, the Porfiriato's universities focused on the sciences, influenced by French positivism. Vasconcelos attended the National Preparatory School, an elite high school in Mexico City, and he went on to Escuela de Jurisprudencia in Mexico City (1905). In law school, he became involved with radical students organized as the Ateneo de la Juventud (Youth Atheneum).Vera Cuspinera, \\"Jos√© Vasconcelos\\", p. 1519. The Ateneo de Juventud was led by a Dominican citizen, Pedro Henr√≠quez Ure√±a, who had read Uruguayan essayist Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥'s Ariel, an influential work published in 1900 that was opposed to Anglo cultural influence but also emphasized the redemptive power of education.Krauze, Redeemers, p. 54. The Ateneo de la Juventud had a diverse membership, composed of university professors, artists, other professionals, and students. Some other members included Isidro Fabela and Diego Rivera. Opposed to the D√≠az regime, it formulated arguments against it and its emphasis on positivism by employing French spiritualism, which articulated \\"a new vision of the relationship between individual and society.\\" After graduating from law school, he joined a law firm of Warner, John, and Galston in Washington, DC. Vasconcelos joined the local Anti-Re-election Club in Washington, D.C. It supported the democratic movement to oust the longtime Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az in 1910 and was headed by Francisco I. Madero, the presidential candidate of the Anti-Re-election Party. Vasconcelos returned to Mexico City to participate more directly in the anti-re-election movement, became one of the party's secretaries, and edited its newspaper, El Antireelectionista. After D√≠az was ousted by revolutionary violence that was followed by the election of Madero as elected president of Mexico, Vasconcelos led a structural change at the National Preparatory School. He changed the academic programs and broke with the past positivistic influence. After Madero's assassination in February 1913, Vasconcelos joined the broad movement to defeat the military regime of Victoriano Huerta. Soon, Vasconcelos was forced into exile in Paris, where he met Julio Torri, Doctor Atl, Gabriele D'Annunzio, and other contemporary intellectuals and artists. After Huerta was ousted in July 1914, Vasconcelos returned to Mexico. The Convention of Aguascalientes in 1914, the failed attempt of anti-Huerta regime to find a political solution, which split the factions. The leader of the Constitutionalists, Venustiano Carranza, and General √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n split with more radical revolutionaries, especially Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Vasconcelos chose the side of the Convention and served as Minister of Education during the brief presidential period of Eulalio Guti√©rrez. Villa was defeated by the Constitutionalist Army under Obreg√≥n in the Battle of Celaya in 1915, and Vasconcelos went into exile again. Venustiano Carranza became president of Mexico (1915‚Äì1920), but he was ousted and killed by the Sonoran generals who had helped put him in power. Rector of National University Logo of the National University of Mexico that was designed by Vasconcelos as its rector Vasconcelos returned to Mexico during the interim presidency of Sonoran Adolfo de la Huerta and was named rector the National Autonomous University of Mexico (1920)Krauze, Redeemers, p. 61 As rector, he had a great deal of power, but he accrued even more by ignoring the standard structures, such as the University Council, to govern the institution.Krauze, Redeemers, p. 62. Rather, he exercised personal power and began implementing his vision of the function of the university. He redesigned the logo of the university to show a map of Latin America, with the phrase \\"Por mi raza hablar√° el esp√≠ritu\\" (The spirit will speak for my race), an influence of Rod√≥'s arielismo.Krauze, Redeemers, p. 62 It also had an eagle and a condor and a background of the volcanic mountains in central Mexico. Vasconcelos is said to have declared, \\"I have not come to govern the University but to ask the University to work for the people.\\"Quoted in Krauze, Redeemers, p. 62. Secretary of Public Education Statue of Jos√© Vasconcelos in Mexico City When Obreg√≥n became president in 1920, he created the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) in 1921 and named Vasconcelos as its head. Under Obreg√≥n, the national budget had two key expenditures; not surprisingly, the military was one, but the other was education. Creating the Secretariat entailed changing the Constitution of 1917, and so Obreg√≥n's government had to muster support from lawmakers. Vasconcelos traveled throughour Mexico while he was rector of the university to seek that support. His effort succeeded, and Vasconcelos was named head of the new cabinet-level secretariat in July 1921.Dulles, Yesterday in Mexico, p. 119. His tenure at the Secretariat gave him a powerful position to implement his vision of Mexico's history, especially the Mexican Revolution. Vasconcelos printed huge numbers of texts for the expanded public school system, but in the 1920s, there was no agreement about how the Mexican Revolution should be portrayed and so earlier history texts by Justo Sierra, the head of the ministry of public education during the D√≠az regime, continued to be used. Although Vasconcelos was no advocate of Mexican indigenous culture, as Secretary of Education, he sent Brazil a statue of the last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtemoc, for their centennial celebrations of independence in 1923 to the disdain and the amazement of the South American recipients. Later life He resigned in 1924 because of his opposition to President Plutarco El√≠as Calles. He worked for the education of the masses and sought to make the nation's education on secular, civic, and Pan-American (americanista) lines. He ran for president in 1929 but lost to Pascual Ortiz Rubio in a controversial election and again left the country. He later directed the National Library of Mexico (1940) and presided over the Mexican Institute of Hispanic Culture (1948). Philosophical thought bust) of Jose Vasconcelos at the Instituto Campechano, Mexico. Vasconcelos' first writings on philosophy are passionate reactions against the formal, positivistic education at the National Preparatory School, formerly under the influence of Porfirian thinkers like Justo Sierra and Gabino Barreda. A second period of productivity was fed by a first disappointment in the political field, after Madero's murder. In 1919, he wrote a long essay on Pythagorism, as a dissertation on the links between harmony and rhythm and its eventual explanation into a frame of aesthetic monism. As he argued that only by the means of rhythm can humans able to know the world without any intermediation, he proposed that the minimal aspects of cognition are conditioned by a degree of sympathy with the natural \\"vibration\\" of things. In that manner, he thought that the auditive categories of knowledge were much higher than the visual ones. Later, Vasconcelos developed an argument for the mixing of races, as a natural and desirable direction for humankind. That work, known as ('The Cosmic Race'), would eventually contribute to further studies on ethnic values as an ethic and for the consideration of ethnic variety as an aesthetic source. Finally, between 1931 and 1940, he tried to consolidate his proposals by publishing his main topics organized in three main works: ('Metaphysics'), ('Ethics'), and ('Aesthetics'). In the final part of his life, he gradually fell into a deeply Catholic political conservatism. Before the Second World War, he had begun writing sympathetically about Francisco Franco, and he retracted some of his earlier liberal positions. One of his last published works, Letan√≠as del atardecer (1957) is a pessimistic tract that hinted that the use of nuclear weapons might be necessary because of the postwar order. Influence Jos√© Vasconcelos (left) with Jos√© Urquidi, Rafael Zubar√°n Capmany and Peredo. Vasconcelos is often referred to as the father of the philosophy. In recent times, it has come under criticism from Native Americans because of its negative implications concerning indigenous peoples. To an extent, his philosophy argued for a new, \\"modern\\" mestizo people, at the cost of cultural assimilation for all ethnic groups. His research on the nature of Mexican modern identity had a direct influence on the young writers, poets, anthropologists, and philosophers who wrote on this subject. He also influenced the point of view of Carlos Pellicer with respect to several aesthetic assumptions reflected in his books. Together, Pellicer and Vasconcelos made a trip through the Middle East (1928‚Äì1929) and were looking for the \\"spiritual basis\\" of Byzantine architecture. Other works, particularly and , had a decisive influence in Octavio Paz's ('The Labyrinth of Solitude'), with anthropological and aesthetic implications. Paz wrote that Vasconcelos was \\"the teacher\\" who had educated hundreds of young Latin American intellectuals during his many trips to Central and South America. Vasconcelos was a guest lecturer at Columbia University and Princeton University, but his influence on new generations in the United States gradually decreased. Nevertheless, his work has been used by Chicano and Mexican-American movements since the 1970s, which assert the ('retaking' or literally 'reconquest') of the American Southwest, based on their Mexican ancestry. Contributions to and education Vasconcelos caused the National Symphonic Orchestra (1920) and the Symphonic Orchestra of Mexico (1928) to be officially endorsed. Muralists Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros were given the right to paint the inner walls of the most important public buildings in Mexico (such as the National Palace in Mexico City), creating the Mexican mural movement.

It contrasts with Halifax Peninsula, which lies across the Northwest Arm. History The area lies west of the Northwest Arm and Bedford Basin and extends several kilometres inland, encompassing an area of Halifax County that the former City of Halifax had annexed in 1969. This includes the former communities of Armdale, Clayton Park, Fairview, Rockingham, Purcell's Cove and Spryfield. The term \\"Mainland Halifax\\" became the official descriptionHRM - Planning of the area after the municipal merger in 1996 which saw the creation of the Halifax Regional Municipality, or HRM, as a single-tier municipal unit within Halifax County, resulting in the disincorporation of the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, as well as the town of Bedford and the Municipality of the County of Halifax. The City of Halifax became a provincial metropolitan area, and the HRM divided the former city into two separate community planning areas, Halifax Peninsula and Mainland Halifax, with separate community councils inside of the regional government.

Julias lay in an administrative district known as Gaulonitis. Historians have suggested that the name is also referenced in rabbinic literature under the epithet ·π¢aidan ().Historical geographer Samuel Klein opines that this place is to be recognised in the name (·π¢aidan) of Mishnah Gittin 7:5, Mishnah Avodah Zarah 3:7, Mishnah Gittin 4:7 (BT Gittin 46a), and Jerusalem Talmud (She·∏≥alim 6:2). Klein wrote: \\"\`Bethsaida = Julias at the confluence of the Jordan in the lake, [a place] not proven in Jewish tradition.\` (Sch.) ‚Äì However, I suspect that Bethsaida occurs in the Talmudic literature called ·π¢aidan. ...The fact that the name ·π¢aidan () is not preceded by the word 'Beth' () presents no difficulty in explaining the two names as being identical, since similar things are more common among Galilean names (e.g. Maon and Meron; Beth-Maon and Beth-Meron)\\" (Klein 1915:167‚Äì168). Herbert Danby, in his English translation of the Mishnah, erroneously transliterated the proper name in all places as \\"Sidon\\" in Phoenicia, even though Sidon is almost always spelt in Hebrew as , with a waw (). Marcus Jastrow also follows the general view that is none other than Sidon of Phoenicia. Conversely, the Yemenite Babylonian Talmud, punctuated by Yosef Amir, has distinguished between the two sites, assigning the vowels pata·∏• and qama·π£ for ·π¢aidan = , but ·∏•iraq and ·∏•olam for the Phoenician city Sidon = . German theologian H.W. Kuhn, citing archaeologist Richard A. Freund (Freund 1995:267‚Äì311), further supports this view, and writes: \\"The Rabbinic literature in which Bethsaida appears, as already mentioned, is never called 'Julias', but rather speaks of '(Beth-)saida' ( = ·π¢aidan, etc.; [whereas] = Beth ·π£aidan, or anything similar, also does not appear in rabbinic texts), so like the canonical gospels, it uses this name for the village. From these texts I refer merely to one [village] presumably\\" (Kuhn 2015:153). An anecdote has been passed down in the Midrash Rabba (Kohelet Rabba 2:11), where Hadrian asked Rabbi Yehoshua b. Hananiah about the preeminence of the Land of Israel over other lands, particularly where the Scripture (Deuteronomy 8:9) imputes of the country that it is \\"a land wherein you shall eat bread without scarceness, [and] you shall not lack any thing therein.\\" When asked whether or not the country could produce for him three things: peppercorns, pheasants (phasianum) and silk, the rabbi brought for him peppercorns from Nas·∏•ana, pheasants from ·π¢aidan and silk from Gush Halav, ‚Äì meaning, the place was reckoned as in the Land of Israel proper.In the Jerusalem Talmud (She·∏≥alim 6:2), after mentioning Lake Hulah and the Sea of Galilee, Saidan is then mentioned as a place where there was an abundance of different kinds of fish, as alluded to in Ezekiel 47:8‚Äì10, and where it was said of a certain river that \\"their fish shall be after their kinds.\\" Klein has speculated that this Saidan refers to Bethsaida along the Jordan River (Klein 1915:167‚Äì168). Cf. Ishtori Haparchi, Kaftor wa-Ferach vol. 2, (3rd edition, published by ed. Avraham Yosef Havatzelet), chapter 11, Jerusalem 2007, p. 54 (note 30) (Hebrew). In the Gospels According to , Bethsaida was the hometown of the apostles Peter, Andrew, and Philip. In the Gospel of Mark (), Jesus reportedly restored a blind man's sight at a place just outside the ancient village of Bethsaida. In , Jesus miraculously feeds five thousand near Bethsaida. Location: historical sources Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, places Bethsaida on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. The historian Josephus says that the town of Bethsaida - at that time called Julias (), was situated 120 stadia from the lake Semechonitis, not far from the Jordan River as it passes into the middle of the Sea of Galilee.Josephus, The Jewish War 3.10.7 De Situ Terrae Sanctae, a 6th-century account written by Theodosius the archdeacon describes Bethsaida's location in relation to Capernaum, saying that it was distant from Capernaum.Rami Arav & Richard Freund (eds.), Bethsaida: A City by the North Shore of the Sea of Galilee, vol. 3, Truman State University 2004, p. xii, The distance between Bethsaida and Paneas is said to have been . Identification: the candidates Although Bethsaida is believed to be located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, there is disagreement among scholars as to precisely where. Since the nineteenth century, three places have been considered as the possible location of Biblical Betsaida: the Bedouin village of Messadiye; the small, deserted settlement of El-Araj (Beit HaBek, \\"House of the Bey\\"); and the archaeological site (tell) of Et-Tell.Shpigel, Noa and Schuster, Ruth. \\"The Lost Home of Jesus' Apostles Has Just Been Found, Archaeologists Say\\", Haaretz, August 6, 2017 Over time, the latter two locations have come to appear more likely. While Messadiye and El-Araj are closer to the Sea of Galilee, Et-Tell shows significant archaeological remains including fragments of fishing equipment. No trace of the name Bethsaida has been found in the district, but any one of the sites named would meet the requirements. * Et- Tell, a site on the east bank of the Jordan River, is promoted by the Bethsaida Excavations Project, lead by Rami Arav. * El-Araj is proposed by a second group, led by Mordechai Aviam, under the auspices of the Center for Holy Land Studies.Pfister, Samuel DeWitt. \\"Where Is Biblical Bethsaida?\\", Bible History Daily, Biblical Archaeological Society, June 16, 2019. Et- Tell Archaeologists tend to agree that the capital of the kingdom of Geshur was situated at et-Tell, a place also inhabited on a lesser scale during the first centuries BCE and CE and sometimes identified with the town of Bethsaida of New Testament fame. The first excavations of the site were conducted in 1987‚Äì1989, by the Golan Research Institute. In 2008‚Äì2010, and in 2014, archaeological excavations of the site were conducted by Rami Arav on behalf of the University of Nebraska of Omaha, Nebraska.Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2008, Survey Permit # G-31; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2009, Survey Permit # G-45; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010, Survey Permit # G-42; Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2014, Survey Permit # G-46 According to Arav, the ruin of et-Tell is said to be Bethsaida, a ruined site on the east side of the Jordan on rising ground, from the sea. This distance poses a problem, however, insofar that if it were a fishing village, it is situated far from the shore of the Sea of Galilee. In an attempt to rectify the problem, the following hypotheses have been devised: #Tectonic rifting has uplifted et-Tell (the site is located on the Great African-Syrian Rift fault). #The water level has dropped from increased population usage, and land irrigation. In fact, the excavation of Magdala's harbor has proven that the ancient water-level was much higher than it is today.F. D. Troche, ‚ÄúAncient Fishing Methods and Fishing Grounds in the Lake of Galilee‚Äù Palestine Exploration Quarterly, 148,4 (2016) 290-91. #The Jordan River delta has been extended by sedimentation.\\"Bethsaida- An Ancient Fishing Village on the shore of the Sea of Galilee\\", Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 21 Mar 2000 Basalt gate of city, at Tel Bethsaida =Bronze and Iron Ages= Excavations indicate that the settlement was founded in the 10th century BCE, in the biblical period. Et-Tell was inhabited during both the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. The fortified town there is associated by researchers with the biblical kingdom of Geshur. Imposing archaeological finds, mainly the Stratum V city gate, date to the post-Geshurite 8th century BCE, but there are indications, as of 2016, that the archaeologists are close to locating the 10th-century BCE, that is: Geshurite, city gate as well. The et-Tell site would have been easily the largest and strongest city to the east of the Jordan Valley during the Iron Age II era. In July 2018, a group of twenty archaeologists led by Rami Arav discovered a structure identified as a city gate. They tentatively identified the city with biblical Zer, a name used during the First Temple period. =Hellenistic and Roman periods= Et-Tell was inhabited on a lesser scale during the first centuries BCE and CE than in the Bronze Age and Iron Ages. Archaeological excavations at site have revealed fishing gear, including lead weights used for fishing nets, as well as sewing needles for repairing fishing nets. The findings indicate that most of the city's economy was based on fishing on the Sea of Galilee. Two silver coins dating to 143 BCE, as well as Slavonic bronze coins, bronze coins from the time of Alexander Jannaeus, King of the Hasmonean dynasty (reigned c. 103-76 BCE), and one coin from the time of Philip the Tetrarch (a son of Herod the Great), ruler of the Bashan (reigned 4 BCE - 34 CE), were discovered at the site.Aryeh Kindler, \\"The Coins of the Tetrarch Philip and Bethsaida\\", Cathedra 53, September 1989, pp. 26-24 (Hebrew) Philip the Tetrarch applied the name \\"Julias\\" () to the site, which he named after Caesar's daughter.Josephus, Antiquities 18.2.1. (18.26) Al- Araj According to Josephus, around the year 30/31 CE (or 32/33 CE) Herod Philip II raised the village of Bethsaida in Lower Gaulanitis to the rank of a polis and renamed it \\"Julias,\\" in honor of Livia, the wife of Augustus. It lay near the place where the Jordan enters the Sea of Galilee.Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XVIII, ii, 1; The Jewish War, II, ix, 1; III, x, 7; The Life of Flavius Josephus, 72. Julias/Bethsaida was a city east of the Jordan River, in a \\"desert place\\" (that is, uncultivated ground used for grazing). If this is the location to which Jesus retired by boat with his disciples to rest a while. The multitude following on foot along the northern shore of the lake would cross the Jordan by the ford at its mouth, which is used by foot travelers to this day. The \\"desert\\" of the narrative is just the barrƒ´yeh of the Arabs, where the animals are driven out for pasture. The \\"green grass\\" of , and the \\"much grass\\" of John 6:10, point to some place in the plain of el-BatÃ£eihÃ£ah, on the rich soil of which the grass is green and plentiful, compared to the scanty herbage on the higher slopes. =Excavation= In 2017, archaeologists announced the discovery of a Roman bathhouse at el-Araj, which is taken as proof that the site was a polis in the Roman Empire period. The bathhouse was located in a layer below the Byzantine layer, with an intervening layer of mud and clay that indicated a break in occupation between 250 and 350 CE. They also found what might be the remains of a Byzantine church building, matching the description of a traveller in 750 CE. On account of these discoveries, the archaeologists believe that el-Araj is now the most likely candidate for the location of Bethsaida. In 2019, what some describe as the Church of Apostles was unearthed by the El-Araj excavations team during the fourth season at the site of Bethsaida-Julias / Beithabbak (El-Araj), on the north shore of Sea of Galilee near where the Jordan river enters the lake. The excavation was carried out by Prof. Mordechai Aviam of Kinneret College and Prof. R. Steven Notley of Nyack College. This Byzantine period church is believed by some to have been built over the house of the apostle brothers, Peter and Andrew. Only the southern rooms of the church were excavated. A well-protected ornamental mosaic floor, gilded glass tesserae, and a marble chancel decorated with a wreath have been found in some of the excavated rooms. According to Professor Notley: El- Mesydiah El-Mesydiah, also spelled el-Mes‚Äõadƒ´yeh is a third, but generally considered least likely possibility. It is located on the present shoreline, but preliminary excavations, including the use of ground penetrating radar, initially revealed only a small number of ruins dating from before the Byzantine period. Some were inclined to favor el-Mes‚Äõadƒ´yeh which stands on an artificial mound about from the mouth of the River Jordan. However, the name is in origin radically different from Bethsaida. The substitution of sƒ´n for ·π£ƒÅd is easy, but the insertion of the guttural ‚Äõain is impossible. One or two Bethsaidas? Many scholars maintain that all the New Testament references to Bethsaida apply to one place, namely, Bethsaida Julias. The arguments for and against this view may be summarized as follows. =A Golan site could be called \\"Galilean\\"= Galilee ran right round the lake, including most of the level coastland on the east. Thus Gamala, on the eastern shore, was within the jurisdiction of Josephus, who commanded in Galilee.Flavius Josephus, The Jewish War, II, xx, 4. Judas of GamalaFlavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XVIII, i, l. is also called Judas of Galilee.Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XVIII, i, 6 If Gamala, far up the slope towering over the eastern shore of the sea, were in Galilee, a fortiori Bethsaida, a town which lay on the very edge of the Jordan, may be described as in Galilee. =Gaulanitis distinct from Galilee= Josephus makes it plain that Gamala, while added to his jurisdiction, was not in Galilee, but in Gaulanitis.Flavius Josephus, The Jewish War, II, xx, 6 Even if Judas were born in Gamala, and so might properly be called a Gaulanite, he may, like others, have come to be known as belonging to the province in which his active life was spent. \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" for instance was born in Bethlehem in Judaea. Josephus also explicitly says that Bethsaida was in Lower Gaulanitis .Flavius Josephus, The Jewish War, II, ix, 1 Further, Luke places the country of the Gerasenes on the other side of the sea from Galilee (Luke 8:26) ‚Äì antip√©ra t√™s Galila√≠as (\\"over against Galilee\\"). =\\"The other side\\": meaning= *To go to the other side ‚Äì eis t√≤ p√©ran (Mark 6:45) ‚Äì does not of necessity imply passing from the west to the east coast of the lake, since Josephus uses the verb diaperai√≥≈ç of a passage from Tiberias to Taricheae.Flavius Josephus, The Life of Flavius Josephus, 59 But *#this involved a passage from a point on the west to a point on the south shore, \\"crossing over\\" two considerable bays; whereas if the boat started from any point in el-BatÃ£eihÃ£ah, to which we seem to be limited by the \\"much grass\\", and by the definition of the district as belonging to Bethsaida, to sail to et-Tell or el-Araj, it was a matter of coasting not more than a couple of miles, with no bay to cross. *#No case can be cited where the phrase eis t√≤ p√©ran certainly means anything else than \\"to the other side\\". *#Mark says that the boat started to go unto the other side to Bethsaida, while John, gives the direction \\"over the sea unto Capernaum\\" (John 6:17). The two towns were therefore practically in the same line. Now there is no question that Capernaum was on \\"the other side\\", nor is there any suggestion that the boat was driven out of its course; and it is quite obvious that, sailing toward Capernaum, whether at Tell HÃ£≈´m or at KhƒÅn Minyeh, it would never reach Bethsaida Julias *The words of Mark (), it is suggested,William Sanday, Sacred Sites of the Gospels, 42. have been too strictly interpreted: as the Gospel was written probably at Rome, its author being a native, not of Galilee, but of Jerusalem. Want of precision on topographical points, therefore, need not surprise us. But as we have seen above, the \\"want of precision\\" must also be attributed to the writer of . The agreement of these two favors the strict interpretation. Further, if the Gospel of Mark embodies the recollections of Peter, it would be difficult to find a more reliable authority for topographical details connected with the sea on which his fisher life was spent. =Arguments for one Bethsaida= In support of the single-city theory it is further argued that *#Jesus withdrew to Bethsaida as being in the jurisdiction of Philip, when he heard of the murder of John the Baptist by Herod Antipas, and would not have sought again the territories of the latter so soon after leaving them. *#Medieval works of travel notice only one Bethsaida. *#The east coast of the sea was definitely attached to Galilee in AD 84, and Ptolemy (c. 140) places Julias in Galilee. It is therefore significant that only the Fourth Gospel speaks of \\"Bethsaida of Galilee\\". *#There could hardly have been two Bethsaidas so close together. =Arguments for two Bethsaidas= But: *#It is not said that Jesus came hither that he might leave the territory of Antipas for that of Philip; and in view of , and Luke 9:10, the inference from Matthew 14:13 that he did so, is not warranted. *#The Bethsaida of medieval writers was evidently on the west of the Jordan River. If it lay on the east, it is inconceivable that none of them should have mentioned the river in this connection. *#If the Gospel of John was not written until well into the 2nd century, then John the Apostle was not the same person as the author John the Evangelist. But this is a very precarious assumption. John, writing after AD 84, would hardly have used the phrase \\"Bethsaida of Galilee\\" of a place only recently attached to that province, writing, as he was, at a distance from the scene, and recalling the former familiar conditions. *#In view of the frequent repetition of names in Palestine the nearness of the two Bethsaidas raises no difficulty. The abundance of fish at each place furnished a good reason for the recurrence of the name.  1217 battle  During the Fifth Crusade, the well-mounted crusader army led by King Andrew II of Hungary defeated Sultan Al-Adil I at Bethsaida on the Jordan River on 10 November 1217.

His maternal grandfather was The Earl of Mayo, Lord Archbishop of Tuam. After completing his education at Wotton-under-Edge, he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, and obtained his B.A. in 1835 and M.A. in 1838.\\"Hale, Matthew Blagden (HL830MB)\\". In Venn, J. A. 1947 A Cambridge Alumni Database. University of Cambridge. During his time at Cambridge he met Harold Browne and they became lifelong friends. Both came under the influence of Charles Simeon who celebrated fifty years of evangelical ministry at (Holy) Trinity Church in 1832. The antislavery movement driven by William Wilberforce also influenced Hale and he wanted to minister to the newly emancipated slaves, particularly in the West Indies, but was not encouraged to do so neither by his family nor by the missionary society working in that region.Gourlay 2015, pp. 5-11. Hale was ordained a deacon in the Church of England in 1836, and priest in 1837 by the Bishop of Bristol and Gloucester. From 1836 to 1838 he was curate of Tresham. In 1838 he acted as curate of Wootton-under-Edge, then from 1839 to 1845 Perpetual Curate of Stroud, an expanding woollen-cloth manufacturing centre in Gloucestershire. In 1840 Hale married Sophia Clode, with whom he would have three children, the eldest of whom died in infancy. Sophia died in early 1845 followed by Hale's mother a few months later. Hale had an emotional breakdown and resigned.Gourlay 2015, p. 14. Subsequently, he served briefly as Rector of Alderley in 1845 and 1846, and then as Perpetual Curate of Atworth with Wraxhill in 1846 and 1847.Venn 1947 South Australia In 1847 he met Bishop Short at a friend's house, and was persuaded to accompany him to Adelaide. Hale, with his two surviving daughters and two servants in late December 1847 arrived in South Australia, where he was appointed first Archdeacon of Adelaide. The following year during a pastoral visit to Western Australia with Bishop Short he married Sabina, eldest daughter of John and Georgiana Molloy.Gourlay 2015, p. 19-21. Subsequently, after Hale returned to Adelaide, he was appointed the first rector of St Matthew's church at Kensington.South Australian 27 Mar 1849, p. 2; 12 Jun 1849, p. 2. In early 1850 Hale approached the Governor of South Australia proposing an institution for young Aborigines where they would live in one little community to learn practical skills in farming and domestic arts and to receive Christian teaching. Later that year he volunteered his services as mission superintendent. His offer was accepted and the Natives' Training Institution was opened at Poonindie, near Port Lincoln, in October 1850. Hale and his family moved to Poonindie soon afterwards and Mathew and Sabina's eldest surviving son, Mathew, was born there in July next year. The Institution prospered and when Bishop Short visited in February 1853, there were 54 Aborigines resident, eleven of whom were baptised by the Bishop.Gourlay 2015, pp. 25-36; Hale, M. B., 1889.

Mitchell at the Swan River Colony In 1856 Hale resigned to accept an invitation to serve as Bishop of Perth. In July 1856 he arrived in Western Australia on the Guyon, which had diverted to Port Lincoln to pick him up,Adelaide Observer 31 May 1856, p.4. along with his two eldest daughters and sister-in-law Georgiana Molloy,Adelaide Times 17 Jun 1856, p. 2. and in November the rest of his family arrived there from South Australia. In March 1857, Hale returned to England with his family, where on 25 July 1857 he was consecrated as the first Bishop of Perth at the Lambeth Palace Chapel. The sermon was preached by Hale's longtime friend from their university days, Professor Harold Browne. According to its usual custom Cambridge University awarded the new bishop an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. While Hale accepted this academic honour, he was reluctant to adopt the style and title of \\"My Lord\\", maintaining that as a colonial bishop he would be better without it. However, the legal authorities ruled that he must accept it and he did so.Gourlay 2015, p. 39. Leaving his family in England Hale returned to Western Australia on the convict ship Nile early in 1858, to take up office as Bishop of Perth. It had been an eventful and dangerous voyage. The problems arising from transportation were evident when Hale had made his initial tour of his diocese-to-be and he had prepared a report on The Transportation Question,Hale, M. B., 1857. The Transportation Question: or why Western Australia should be made a Reformatory Colony instead of a Penal Settlement. Macmillan, Cambridge, UK, 98 p. advocating measures to make Western Australia a reformatory colony rather than a penal settlement. This was published while he was in England. Hale's report demanded change in the colony's penal system. When copies reached Perth before he returned from England, there was a storm of criticism in the local news media, claiming that Hale's report was \\"full of misrepresentations and errors\\".Inquirer & Commercial News (Perth, WA) 18 Nov 1857, p. 3. However, when Hale's own account of his voyage on the Nile and the behavior of the convicts on it was published, he was vindicated and newspaper editors were commending Hale, even as the Colonial Governor was disapproving because of \\"embarrassment to Her Majesty‚Äôs Government\\".Perth Gazette 10 Sep 1858, p. 2. In June 1858, after he returned from England, Hale opened a boys' school for both boarders and day pupils.Perth Gazette 18 Jun 1858, p. 2. The Bishop's School was modelled after England's public schools. Many of the pupils who attended it came from leading families in the colony; many of them went on to become prominent in Western Australian business and politics. Hale had continuing problems in finding suitable schoolmasters and funds to support his school. Eventually this proved too much for him and the Bishop's School closed on 1 March 1872. However it continued on under different management and eventually became today's Hale School. Bishop Hale is generally recognised as the pioneer of secondary education in Western Australia.Gourlay 2015, pp. 45-47. Communications with the eastern colonies and England were made by sailing ship when Hale arrived in the colony in 1856 and by steamship when he left in 1875. Albany was the first port of call on the Australian continent. Hence Hale was the first Australian bishop to receive his invitation to the first Lambeth Conference held in 1867 and was the only one to attend it.Gourlay 2015, p. 52. In 1870 a crisis arose when the lady running an orphanage for indigenous children in Albany was unable to continue this work. Hale decided to resign as bishop, apply for the vacant chaplaincy at Albany, and carry on this orphanage work himself. As soon as his intention to resign became known in Perth, a large deputation from the Protestant community called on Hale and persuaded him to withdraw it. In explaining his intentions to his friends Hale reminded them that \\"I have no hesitation in saying that a European population disregarding the welfare of the natives, whom it has displaced from their country, will not ensure God‚Äôs blessing and therefore I do hope that the public generally will support the Mission at Albany\\".Perth Gazette & West Australian Times 21 Jun 1870, p. 1; Gourlay 2015, pp. 53-56. In July 1871 Hale met with his clergy and laity to draw up the constitution for a Diocesan synod and the first synod was held in Perth in August 1872. He opened this synod with a significant sermon Being all things to all menHale, M. B., 1872. Being All Things to All Men; The duty of the individual Christian and the duty of the Church with reference thereto - a Sermon. Proceedings of the First Session of the First Synod of the Diocese of Perth, Western Australia. August 1872. M. Shenton, Perth, WA, (12 p). on the responsibilities of both individual Christians and the Church in their relationships with the world.Gourlay 2015, pp. 56-59. =Leaving= Hale was Bishop of Perth until 1875. On 5 April that year he received letters from Bishop Barker of Sydney and Bishop Short of Adelaide asking for his consent to be nominated as second Bishop of Brisbane. He was reluctant to accept this new responsibility, since he was in his mid sixties and looking forward to retirement in a few years time, and did so only on the condition that he had the unanimous support of all the Australian bishops.Gourlay 2015, p. 61. There was a public farewell to Bishop Hale on 30 October 1875 at which an address from the congregation of St George's Cathedral and members of other Christian communions was read.West Australian Times 26 Oct 1875, p. 2; 2 Nov 1875, pp. 2-3. Hale's ministry and influence in Western Australia had not been confined to the Anglican Church but involved active co-operation with other Christian groups in matters of common interest. In particular the Congregationalists commended him for originating and fostering \\"institutions for promoting the moral and religious welfare of the community\\" and for his \\"truly missionary spirit\\". They were pleased that he was always ready to contend for the truth \\"as it is in Jesus, ...\\" They attributed the \\"truly evangelical and peaceful character of his episcopate to his true love for the Bible, the word of God; ... . \\" They also recognised his \\"hearty co-operation with others\\" not belonging to his Church, concluding that they united with members of his Church and all Protestant fellow colonists, in praying for his future welfare, peace and happiness.West Australian Times 29 Oct 1875, p. 2. The Bishop acknowledged each address, thanking \\"his dear friends\\" for their very kind words, sometimes suggesting that his own contribution was not as much as stated, other times reminding \\"his Sons and Daughters in the Lord Jesus Christ\\" to whom he had ministered, that \\" ........ my sole aim in my teaching has been to set forth faithfully and simply the blessed truths which are to be found in God‚Äôs Holy Word\\". He also referred to the \\"mutual kindness and good will which exists between members of the different religious bodies in this country who hold to those great Scriptural doctrines which were ......... brought to light a second time at the period of the Reformation, and which are to us more precious than rubies\\". In concluding his various replies he asked for their prayers for him in his difficult new task and assured them of his continuing prayers and interest in their affairs.Gourlay 2015, p. 63; West Australian Times 2 Nov 1875, p. 3. The editors of the local newspapers were lavish in their praise of the departing bishop. The Western Australian Times farewell editorial began with the words \\"We admire great men and give genius its due need of fame, but the good man gains not only our admiration but our hearts ... . After outlining Hale‚Äôs many contributions to the life of the colony the editorial concluded with the following commendation of Hale \\"He has shown us what a true christian pastor can do, and how the holding of a high and honoured office is not inconsistent with a brotherly bearing towards all, and that a helping hand and a kind word, go more to make up real christianity, than austere looks, and obstinate theories; and without disparagement of others, we fear we may say that 'take him all in all we‚Äôll never see his like again'.\\"West Australian Times 22 Oct 1875, p. 2. The Perth Inquirer in its valedictory tribute commented \\"There are few individuals among the more conspicuous leaders of any religious community upon whom suspicion ....... has never breathed its taint. Bishop Hale is one of those few\\".Inquirer & Commercial News (Perth, WA) 2 Nov 1875, p. 2. Hale not only left the people of Perth with much goodwill and positive memories of his ministry, he also presented to the church the Bishop's house and grounds which were his own private property. The value of these and other money given by him while he was in Western Australia probably totaled nearly ¬£10,000 - about A$1,000,000 in current (2014) value.West Australian 12 Apr 1895, p. 2; Robin, A. de Q., 1976 , Mathew Blagden Hale: the life of an Australian pioneer bishop Hawthorn Press, Melbourne Vic..p. 112. Queensland Hale in his later years Hale received an enthusiastic welcome when he was installed as second Bishop of Brisbane in St John's Church on 15 December 1875.Brisbane Courier 16 Dec 1875, p. 3. In his first address to his new flock Hale made it clear that he had been brought to Queensland to deal with the problem of providing ministry to people in vast areas of country where there were no churches or clergymen. He would be powerless to do anything about it because of his lack of resources; resources, which in the absence of any state aid for religion in the colony, only could come from the freewill offerings of established congregations and individuals.Gourlay 2015, pp. 69-71. To deal with this lack of resources the General Church Fund was launched at a meeting in Brisbane on the evening of 23 March 1876.Brisbane Courier 23 Mar 1876, p. 1. It was intended that each congregation in the diocese would contribute to the fund by passing on to the Diocesan Council the money received from weekly offerings on two Sundays every year. At the same time direct contributions were to be solicited from individuals to build up the capital sum. Hale himself was disappointed that some of the speeches at the meeting did not indicate a sense of \\"the importance and the gravity of the matter which we met together to discuss\\". His opinion was supported by the lack of donations received.Gourlay 2015, pp. 74-76; Queenslander 29 Apr 1876, p. 14. Hale toured his region widely. He hoped and devoutly prayed that his visits from place to place would serve to bind Church of England people in the colony more closely together. Hale's determined goal was to see the church \\"act more in concert one with another than we have done\\". We must realise \\"that we are all one body, united in our blessed Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, as to one Head, being all members one of another, as members of His body\\". Hale felt the concern of the present period of commercial depression, commenting \\"That which hinders the performance of good works and holds people back from making adequate offerings to God, is very rarely the real inability to give. The hindrance arises in almost all cases from the want of a proper estimate of what is really owing to God, and from the weakness of men‚Äôs faith ....... \\"Australian Churchman 3 Jun 1876, pp. 781-782 Twelve months after Hale had arrived in Brisbane what had been given to the fund so far was completely inadequate. Hale felt that this situation indicated that his coming to Brisbane had been a mistake and so in January 1877 he submitted his resignation to Bishop Barker. After intervention by Bishop Barker, the people and churches in Brisbane were shamed into a commitment to support the General Church Fund and Hale withdrew his resignation. Nevertheless, despite Hale's generous personal donations, the funds received were never sufficient to meet the needs.Gourlay 2015, pp. 83-86. At the second General Synod in Sydney in October 1876 Hale was appointed President of the Executive Council of the Board of Missions (later Australian Board of Missions).Proceedings of the Second General Synod of the Dioceses in Australia and Tasmania [October 1876]. Joseph Cook, Sydney, NSW, 1877, p. 40, 45. In July 1878, with Hale's encouragement, the Brisbane Synod established a Clergy Superannuation and Widows and Orphans Fund,Robin 1976, p.168. while in the following year, after discussions between Hale and Bishop Barker, Synod recognised the establishment of the Diocese of North Queensland.Rayner, K., 1962. The History of the Church of England in Queensland. Thesis (PhD), University of Queensland, St Lucia, Qld, 317 p. www.anglicanarchives.org.au/raynerthesis.pdf In October 1881, as the senior bishop attending, Hale presided over the third General Synod in Sydney.Proceedings of the General Synod of the Dioceses in Australia and Tasmania, Session 1881. Joseph Cook, Sydney, NSW, 1882. Subsequently, he was involved in the negotiations which led to the appointment of Alfred Barry as Bishop of Sydney. In April 1884 he welcomed Barry and participated in his installation in Sydney.Sydney Morning Herald 25 Apr 1884, p. 3. A mark of Hale's ministry in Brisbane as in Perth was his association with members of other Christian churches in causes of common interest. He presided at annual meetings of the local auxiliary of the Bible Society; he addressed a large gathering of Sunday school children in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens in May 1884; he identified himself with the Social Purity Society and its lobbying to change legislation that controlled prostitution; he laid the foundation stones for the Loyal Orange Institution's New Protestant Hall in Ann Street and for the Lutheran Church in Wickham Terrace; he supported the YMCA, having chaired its inaugural meeting in December 1882, and also the work of Temperance societies concerned with the abuse of alcohol, as well as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.Gourlay 2015, pp. 99-104. The Bishop was farewelled on 19 March 1885 at a public gathering in the Exhibition Building, Bowen Hills by 700 to 800 people - Church of England, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Lutheran, Scandinavian, Primitive Methodist, Congregational and Baptist. The Baptist Association in its farewell address had commended him for \\"true catholicity\\" and faithfulness to the principles of his own church. Hale responded \\"There are in existence here evils of fearful magnitude, .... which are threatening to eat into the very heart of the social and domestic happiness of this community. By making common cause with others, and by working heartily with them, I may have been, I trust, through God‚Äôs mercy, able to do at least something towards checking these evils\\".Brisbane Courier 20 Mar 1885, p. 5. The Fortitude Valley branch of the Church of England Temperance Society concisely expressed its appraisal of Hale's ministry. \\"Your many acts of unostentatious charity, the ready help which you have always given to the promotion of evangelical religion, the generous sympathy which you have ever displayed in the cause of temperance, and the liberal and consistent spirit of Christianity which has characterised your Episcopate, have greatly endeared you to all classes of men among whom you have diligently laboured\\".Brisbane Courier 20 Mar 1885, p. 5. The Toowoomba Chronicle was forthright in its commendation of Hale's goodness and openness to cooperation with others and scathing of those Anglicans who refused to follow his example. \\"That the Church of England has not progressed during the past decade in the same ratio as the population is not the Bishop‚Äôs fault. He has had to exercise episcopal functions in a diocese divided against 'itself.' ...... The evangelical breadth of the Bishop has overstrained the unelastic charity of a few of the clergy\\".Toowoomba Chronicle 24 Mar 1885, p.2. The Chronicle's editorial ended with an appreciation of Sabina Hale's contribution to social work in the community, referring particularly to her good relationships with all the other ladies she had worked with, both Anglicans and those of \\"other religious persuasions\\".Toowoomba Chronicle 24 Mar 1885, p.2.

He is the former chairman and president of Duquesne Capital, which he founded in 1981. He closed the fund in August 2010 because he felt unable to deliver high returns to his clients.Forbes: The World's Billionaires - Stanley Druckenmiller March 2013 At the time of closing, Duquesne Capital had over $12 billion in assets. From 1988 to 2000, he managed money for George Soros as the lead portfolio manager for Quantum Fund. He is reported to have made $260 million in 2008. Early life and education Druckenmiller was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Anne and Stanley Thomas Druckenmiller, a chemical engineer.Pittsburgh Post- Gazette: \\"Steelers' suitor Stanley Druckenmiller has always been good at making money\\" By Bill Toland August 17, 2008] He grew up in a middle-class household in the suburbs of Philadelphia. His parents divorced when he was in elementary school and he went to live with his father in Gibbstown, New Jersey (a section of Greenwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey) and then in Richmond, Virginia (his sisters, Helen and Salley, would stay with their mother in Philadelphia). Druckenmiller is a graduate of Collegiate School, Richmond, Virginia. In 1975, he received a BA in English and economics from Bowdoin College (where he opened a hot dog stand with Lawrence B. Lindsey, who later became economic policy adviser to President George W. Bush). He dropped out of a three-year Ph.D. program in economics at the University of Michigan in the middle of the second semester to accept a position as an oil analyst for Pittsburgh National Bank. Investment career Druckenmiller began his financial career in 1977 as a management trainee at Pittsburgh National Bank. He became head of the bank's equity research group after one year. In 1981, he founded his own firm, Duquesne Capital Management. In 1985, he became a consultant to Dreyfus, splitting his time between Pittsburgh and New York, where he lived two days each week. He moved to Pittsburgh full-time in 1986, when he was named head of the Dreyfus Fund. As part of his agreement with Dreyfus, he also maintained management of Duquesne. In 1988, he was hired by George Soros to replace Victor Niederhoffer at Quantum Fund. He and Soros famously \\"broke the Bank of England\\" when they shorted British pound sterling in 1992, reputedly making more than $1 billion in profits, in an event known as Black Wednesday. They calculated that the Bank of England did not have enough foreign currency reserves with which to buy enough sterling to prop up the currency and that raising interest rates would be politically unsustainable. He left Soros in 2000 after taking large losses in technology stocks. Since then, he has concentrated full-time on Duquesne Capital. He is profiled in the book The New Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager. According to Bloomberg News, on August 18, 2010, Druckenmiller announced the closing of his hedge fund \\"telling investors he'd been worn down by the stress of trying to maintain one of the best trading records in the industry while managing an 'enormous amount of capital.'\\" Duquesne Capital Management posts an average annual return of 30 percent without any money-losing year. His funds were down for about 5 percent when he announced his retirement in August. However, they had since erased the losses and closed with a small gain through successful bets that the market would rally in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would announce further \\"Quantitative Easing\\" to assist in reducing unemployment and avoid deflation. According to The Wall Street Journal, on August 18, 2010, Druckenmiller \\"told clients that he's returning their money and ending his firm's 30-year run, citing the 'high emotional toll' of not performing up to his own expectations.\\" He indicated it was not easy to make big profits while handling very large sums of money. His biggest investments are Mirosoft and Amazon in 2020. Investment philosophy Druckenmiller is a top-down investor who adopts a similar trading style as George Soros by holding a group of stocks long, a group of stocks short, and uses leverage to trade futures and currency. In early 2019 he held large positions in Microsoft, Abbott Laboratories, Salesforce.com, Delta Airlines, and American Airlines. Personal life Druckenmiller has been married twice. In 1976, he married his high school sweetheart; they divorced in 1980. In 1988, Druckenmiller married Fiona Katharine Biggs, a Barnard College graduate and niece of investor Barton Biggs, in an Episcopalian ceremony.\\"Fiona K. Biggs Wed in Nevada\\". The New York Times, September 4, 1988 Druckenmiller has three daughters with Biggs: Sarah, Tess, and Hannah. Political and economic views Druckenmiller advocates reducing spending on entitlement programs such as Social Security. Druckenmiller was a major supporter of Republican Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. In 2015, Druckenmiller donated $300,000 total to the presidential candidacies of Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich. In 2020, after the stock market crash and subsequent rally above pre-crash levels, Druckenmiller said he expects inflation in the US economy due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve. Wealth and philanthropy In 2009, Druckenmiller was the most charitable man in America, giving $705 million to foundations that support medical research, education, and anti-poverty, including a $100 million gift to found a Neuroscience Institute at the NYU School of Medicine. Druckenmiller is also Chairman of the Board of Harlem Children's Zone, a multi-faceted, community-based project. Harlem Children's Zone was founded by Druckenmiller's college friend and fellow Bowdoin College alumnus Geoffrey Canada. In 2006, Druckenmiller gave $25 million to the organization. In 2013, Druckenmiller and Canada toured college campuses urging reform in taxation, health care, and Social Security to ensure intergenerational equity. Druckenmiller and his wife are also principal sponsors of the New York City AIDS walk. The Stanley F. Druckenmiller Hall, built in 1997 at Bowdoin College, is named after Druckenmiller's grandfather and was dedicated to Bowdoin by Druckenmiller himself. =Pittsburgh Steelers= In July 2008, Druckenmiller emerged as a potential investor in the Pittsburgh Steelers franchise of the National Football League. The five sons of Steelers founder Art Rooney Sr. were working to restructure ownership of the team, and Druckenmiller was contacted by a member or representative of the Rooney family about buying the shares of several of the Rooney brothers. On September 18, Druckenmiller withdrew his bid to purchase the team. Former Steelers President Dan Rooney stated that he has no ill will toward Druckenmiller, mentioning that he hopes the financier remains a great Steelers fan.

The municipality borders the Czech Republic in the south. The municipality was formed on 1 January 1999 by the merger of the former municipalities Bad Gottleuba, Berggie√üh√ºbel, Langenhennersdorf and Bahratal.Gebiets√§nderungen vom 01.01. bis 31.12.1999 Surrounded by forests and near a water dam Bad Gottleuba-Berggie√üh√ºbel has several facilities, including a spa health park, a plant garden and a heated open air pool. Geography The following villages are part of the municipality: Oelsen in the southeast, Markersbach and Hellendorf in the southeast, Hartmannsbach, Breitenau, B√∂rnersdorf and Hennersbach in the southwest, Bad Gottleuba and Berggie√üh√ºbel in the central part and Zwiesel, Bahra and Langenhennersdorf in the north. The municipality extends up to the foothills of the eastern Ore Mountains and into the Saxon Switzerland. The united spa town is located between the rivers Gottleuba and Bahra. The main settlements Bad Gottleuba and Berggie√üh√ºbel are on the river Gottleuba. Distances from Berggie√üh√ºbel which is more or less in the centre of the combined spa town: *25‚Äì35 km from Dresden *7‚Äì11 km from Pirna *200 km from Berlin *135 km from Prague Since 2005 the town has been easily accessible via the A17 express motorway Dresden - Prague. History In 1459, the boundaries were fixed between Bohemia and Saxony by a contract between the Bohemian king and Frederick II and Duke William III of Saxony, and the area of the current municipality came to Saxony. In 1813, during the Napoleonic Wars, the area suffered damages from battles between the Russians and the French. In 1880, a railway line from Pirna to Berggie√üh√ºbel was opened. As the Gottleuba Valley Railway it was extended to Gottleuba in 1905, and closed in 1976. The Gottleuba Dam in the Gottleuba river was built between 1965 and 1974. =Oelsen= Oelsen is the oldest settlement of the municipality, first mentioned in 1169 as Olesnice.Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Oelsen The name originates from the Czech ole≈°n√°, meaning alder bush. It was one of the first colonised areas of the Knights Hospitaller in the Ore Mountains. In 1429, the Hussites destroyed Oelsen. It wasn't rebuilt until the end of the 15th century. In 1517, the manor of Oelsen was acquired by the B√ºnau family, that held it until 1762. In 1996, Oelsen joined Bad Gottleuba. =and Hellendorf= Markersbach was first documented as Marquardi villa in 1363.Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Markersbach Hellendorf was first mentioned as Heldisdorf in 1379.Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Hellendorf Its school was opened in 1837 and another in 1858. The current school was inaugurated in 1927. In 1970, the two villages were merged into the new municipality Bahratal. =Gottleuba= Coat of arms of Bad Gottleuba View into the Gottleuba valley near Gottleuba Gottleuba was first mentioned in 1363 as Gotlavia,Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Bad Gottleuba but probably already existed at the end of the 13th century. In 1298 Gottleuba together with Pirna became a part of Bohemia. In 1405 Pirna and Gottleuba were taken back by the Margrave of Meissen. Already at the end of the 14th century Gottleuba was a center for mining: mainly iron, silver and copper. The last silver mine was closed in 1889. In 1463, Gottleuba received town privileges. In the 16th century, Gottleuba developed guilds with special commercial laws (for example, holding of spring and autumn markets and grant of weekly markets). Wars, disease, large town fires in 1746 and 1865 and the flood disasters of 1552, 1897 and 1927 and 1957 again brought considerable setbacks to the city. A recuperation centre belonging to the Landesversicherungsanstalt Sachsen was built in Gottleuba in 1909. In 1936 the name was officially changed to Bad Gottleuba. Since 1991, the sanatorium which is named Gesundheitspark Bad Gottleuba has been under the charge of TRIA Immobilienanlagen und Verwaltungs-GmbH in Berlin. =Berggie√üh√ºbel= Coat of arms of Berggie√üh√ºbel Berggie√üh√ºbel was first mentioned as Gy√ühobel in 1412.Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Berggie√üh√ºbel The origin of the name is disputed, one likely explanation is the mountain where ore is melted and poured. In 1548 it received town privileges. The Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) interrupted the iron works. In 1717, medicinal water was found and Berggie√üh√ºbel became a spa town. The baths were damaged in the Napoleonic Wars, but in 1822 the business was rebuilt by Friedrich August Freiherr von Ley√üer. With the opening of a railway line from Pirna to Berggie√üh√ºbel in 1880, the region attracted more visitors. In 1993, the MEDIAN-klinik was opened in the area of Friedrichstal. =Langenhennersdorf and Bahra= former manor in Langenhennersdorf Langenhennersdorf was first mentioned as Hennici villa in 1356Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Langenhennersdorf and was assigned to the Margrave of Meissen in 1404. Bahra was mentioned for the first time in 1524.Digitales Historisches Ortsverzeichnis von Sachsen, Bahra The name originates from the Old High German bar and para, meaning \\"cleared forest\\". Bahra was assigned to the knightly manor (Rittersgut) of Langenhennersdorf in 1548. In 1838, a school was opened in Langenhennersdorf. In 1971, Langenhennersdorf and Bahra became a single municipality. Local council The local council has 16 members. Since the elections in May 2014 the CDU has 11 seats and the Left has 5 seats.

As the son of Archduke Leopold V and Claudia de' Medici, he succeeded his father upon the latter's death in 1632, under his mother's regency. He took over his mother's governatorial duties when he came of age in 1646. To finance his extravagant living style, he sold goods and entitlements. For example, he wasted the exorbitant sum which France had to pay to the Tyrolean Habsburgs for the cession of their fiefs west of the Rhine (Alsace, Sundgau and Breisach). He also fixed the border to Graub√ºnden in 1652. Ferdinand Charles was an absolutist ruler, did not call any diet after 1648 and had his chancellor Wilhelm Biener executed illegally in 1651 after a secret trial. On the other hand, he was a lover of music: Italian opera was performed in his court.  Marriage, children and death  Ferdinand Charles married Anna de' Medici.

BSBI News 73. It may be called true service tree, to distinguish it from wild service tree Sorbus torminalis. Foliage and fruit It is a deciduous tree growing to 15‚Äì20 m (rarely to 30 m) tall with a trunk up to 1 m diameter, though it can also be a shrub 2‚Äì3 m tall on exposed sites. The bark is brown, smooth on young trees, becoming fissured and flaky on old trees. The winter buds are green, with a sticky resinous coating. The leaves are 15‚Äì25 cm long, pinnate with 13-21 leaflets 3‚Äì6 cm long and 1 cm broad, with a bluntly acute apex, and a serrated margin on the outer half or two thirds of the leaflet. The flowers are 13‚Äì18 mm diameter, with five white petals and 20 creamy-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 10‚Äì14 cm diameter in late spring, and are hermaphrodite and insect pollinated. The fruit is a pome 2‚Äì3 cm long, greenish-brown, often tinged red on the side exposed to sunlight; it can be either apple-shaped (f. pomifera (Hayne) Rehder) or pear-shaped (f. pyrifera (Hayne) Rehder). Ecology It is generally rare, listed as an endangered species in Switzerland and Austria, and uncommon in Spain. In the UK, one very old tree that existed in the Wyre Forest before being destroyed by fire in 1862 used to be considered native, but it is now generally considered to be more likely of cultivated origin, probably from a mediaeval monastery orchard planting. More recently, a small population of genuinely wild specimens was found growing as stunted shrubs on cliffs in south Wales (Glamorgan) and nearby southwest England (Gloucestershire). It is a very rare species in Britain, occurring at only a handful of sites. Its largest English population is within the Horseshoe Bend Site of Special Scientific Interest at Shirehampton, near Bristol. A further population has been discovered growing wild in Cornwall on a cliff in the upper Camel Estuary. It is a long-lived tree, with ages of 300‚Äì400 years estimated for some in Britain. The largest and perhaps one of the oldest known specimens in Europe is on an educational trail near the town of Str√°≈ænice in the province of Moravia, Czech Republic. Its trunk measures in circumference, with a crown high and across. It is estimated to be around 450 years old.http://www.treeforeurope.com/ Cultivation and uses Some mature fruits fruits The fruit is a component of a cider-like drink which is still made in parts of Europe. Picked straight off the tree, it is highly astringent and gritty; however, when left to blet (overripen) it sweetens and becomes pleasant to eat.Bean, W. J. (1980). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 4. John Murray . In the Moravian Slovakia region of the Czech Republic, there is a community run museum with an educational trail and festival for this tree, with products like jam, juice and brandy made from its fruit.Hrdousek V. et al: \\"Oskeru≈°e - strom pro novou Evropu\\". Brazda, Hodonin, 2014, 240 pages; 550 pictures The sorb tree is cited in the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Ketubot page 79a. The example refers to a purchase of Abba Zardasa, in a translation by Rashi, an early Medieval scholar, as a forest of trees called Zardasa, that was used for lumber, because the fruit was not commercially important. The Aramaic word 'zardasa' may be the origin of the English word 'sorb'. In Ancient Greece the fruit was cut in half and pickled, which Plato in the Symposium (190d7-8) lets Aristophanes use as a metaphor for the cutting in half of the original spherical humans by Zeus. Service Tree wood was often used for manufacturing wooden planes of all types used for working wood, because Service Tree wood is fairly dense and holds a profile well. Etymology and other names The English name comes from Middle English serves, plural of serve, from Old English syrfe, borrowed from the Latin name sorbus; it is unrelated to the verb serve.Oxford English Dictionary Other English names include sorb, sorb tree, and whitty pear‚Äî\\"whitty\\" because the leaves are similar to rowan (i.e. pinnate), and \\"pear\\" due to the nature of the fruit.

Description It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. The bark is smooth and greyish, but flaky, peeling away in squarish plates to reveal darker brown layers. The leaves are long and broad with a petiole, dark green on both sides, with five to nine acute lobes; the basal pair of lobes are spreading, the rest more forward-pointing and decreasing in size to the leaf apex, and with finely toothed margins; the undersides have small hairs when young, but both sides are smooth and shiny when older; the autumn colour is yellow to red-brown. The flowers are diameter, with five white petals and 20 creamy-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs diameter in late spring to early summer, and are hermaphrodite and insect pollinated. The fruit is a globose to ovoid pome diameter, greenish to russet or brown, patterned with small pale lenticel spots when mature in mid to late autumn.Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Taxonomy There are two varieties: * Sorbus torminalis var. torminalis. Europe, northwest Africa. * Sorbus torminalis var. caucasica. Caucasus and Alborz Mountains. Leaves less deeply lobed than in var. torminalis. The species has sometimes been placed in its own genus, Torminalis. Recent molecular phylogenetics confirms an earlier taxonomic opinion that the genus Sorbus as defined in the broad sense is not monophyletic, but the simple-leafed species traditionally included in Sorbus are a monophyletic group; this species would be included in a clade called Aria (genus Aria or Sorbus subgenus Aria) as the species Aria torminalis Beck. It is a sexually reproducing diploid species that forms diploid and polyploid hybrids with members of subgenus Aria (whitebeams). A number of often very localised stable apomictic polyploid species of ultimately hybrid origin between Sorbus torminalis and various species in the subgenus Aria occur in Europe, including Sorbus latifolia (service tree of Fontainebleau), and Sorbus bristoliensis (Bristol whitebeam). Distribution It is found from England and Wales east to Denmark and Poland, south to northwest Africa, and southeast to southwest Asia from Asia Minor to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins . Ecology Foliage and fruit The wild service tree favours deep fertile soils, but can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions, from chalky, superficial, dry soils to temporarily waterlogged soils. It can adapt to a variety of climatic conditions, but occurs most often in lowlands. Wild service tree is a light-demanding species, often out-competed by other hardwood species. It is relatively rare and in Britain is now usually confined to pockets of ancient woodland, although it can also be found growing in hedgerows. It can often be found associated with oak and ash woods, preferring clay and lime based soils. In Britain, summer temperatures are often too low for the seeds to ripen, so its principal method of propagation is by suckers. Uses and etymology Wood of Sorbus torminalis The wild service tree is one of the most valuable hardwoods in Europe. The wood is fine-grained, very dense and has good bending strength. It was used in the past to make screws for winepresses, billiard cue sticks, musical instruments and turnery. Today, it is usually only used for decorative veneers. The fruits are eaten by many birds and a few mammals, making the tree ecologically important and appreciated by hunters. The fruit, sometimes called \\"chequers\\", are edible and taste similar to dates, although they are now rarely collected for food. They are usually too astringent to eat until they are over-ripe and bletted. They were traditionally known as a herbal remedy for colic; the tree's Latin name, torminalis means \\"good for colic\\". Before the introduction of hops, the fruit were used to flavour beer, which may be related to the ancient symbol of a pub being the chequer-board.G. J. Monson-Fitzjohn gives three possible origins for chequers as a pub name: the chequer board suggests the passing away of odd hours by a game of \\"draughts\\"; others were named from the custom of painting signposts sometimes found outside pubs in alternate black and white squares; and others from the \\"chequy field\\" of the coat of arms of a local landowner. 270 hotels, tavern and inns then bore the name.--Monson-Fitzjohn, G. J. (1926) Quaint Signs of Olde Inns. London: Herbert Jenkins (reissued by Senate, London, 1994 ); pp. 34, 45 Alternatively, the name \\"chequers\\" may have been derived from the spotted pattern of the fruit,Oxford English Dictionary though some suggest it comes from the pattern of the bark on old trees.

History The label was started in 1965 by Marvin Norcross for the label's Southern gospel quartets. Their biggest artist to date is the Happy Goodman Family. After being absent from the southern gospel music industry for several years, Word Entertainment revived the Canaan Records label in 2007, placing Dave Clark as the General Manager of the label and announcing Canaan's relaunch on June 6, 2007. The first group to sign with the label after the relaunch was southern gospel veteran group, The Hoppers, who released their first Canaan Records album, The Ride on September 4, 2007. Early labels were red with black print. Later, the label changed to black with a color logo and a distinctive vertical row of colored dots down the middle of the label. In the mid-1980s, the label changed to a full color label showing a desert town (presumably Canaan) at sunset, with colors fading from green to yellow to orange in the sky, and tones of brown for the sand. For the 2007 relaunch of Canaan Records, the logo was changed to display the word \\"Canaan\\" in a script-style font with the word \\"RECORDS\\" below in a sans-serif font, with the label name surrounded on either side by arching curves, implying an oval shape around the words.

United States Army Brigadier General Henry W. Lawton succeeded in capturing the town, fort, and blockhouses, and protected the right flank of the main American attack on the Heights of San Juan to the south.Nofi, A.A., 1996, The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 2020, Pennsylvania: Combined Books, Background At El Caney, Cuba, 514 Spanish regular soldiers, together with approximately 100 armed Spanish and Cubans loyal to SpainOssad, Steven L., Henry Ware Lawton: Flawed Giant and Hero of Four Wars, Army History (Winter 2080), p. 13 under the command of Brigadier General Joaqu√≠n Vara de Rey y Rubio were instructed to hold the northwest flank of Santiago de Cuba against the American 2nd Division, Fifth Army Corps, commanded by Brigadier General Henry W. Lawton. Battle Although the Spanish defenders had no machine guns, they were well equipped with modern smokeless powder rifles and a battery of two modern breech-loading 80mm mountain howitzers (Ca√±√≥n de 8 cm Plasencia Modelo 1874, designed by Colonel Plasencia of the Spanish Army) that also utilized smokeless ammunition. The Spanish regular infantry was armed with fast-firing M1893 7mm Mauser rifles, while the loyalists were equipped with single-shot Remington Rolling Block rifles in .43 Spanish (using blackpowder).Roosevelt, Theodore, \\"The Rough Riders\\", Scribner's Magazine, Vol. 25 (January‚ÄìJune), New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 572Tucker, Spencer C., The Encyclopedia of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican Wars, Santa Barbara CA: ABC-CLIO Press (2009), p. 840 Denied promised reinforcements from Santiago, Vara de Rey and his forces held over 6,000 Americans from their position for nearly twelve hours before retreating, preventing General Lawton's men from reinforcing the U.S. assault on San Juan Hill. Some of the American forces were hindered by their equipment; in the case of the 2nd Massachusetts, the men were equipped with antiquated black- powder single-shot .45-70 Springfield rifles. According to Frederick E. Pierce, a trooper of the 2nd Massachusetts, the Americans \\"received such a shower of bullets that it seemed at one time as if the company must be wiped out of existence.\\"Nofi, Albert A., From ‚ÄòDagoes‚Äô to ‚ÄòNervy Spaniards‚Äô: American Soldiers‚Äô Views of their Opponents, 1898, On War and Warfare. Because of this unequal contest, the 2nd Massachusetts was later taken out of the line and replaced with troops armed with more modern weapons.Dierks, Jack, A Leap to Arms: The Cuban Campaign of 1898, Philadelphia PA: J.B. Lippincott Company (1970), p. 103 The American forces also lacked effective support fire, as the single Gatling Gun Detachment had been sent to support the troops assaulting San Juan heights. General Lawton's artillery support consisted of a single battery of four 3.2-inch (81 mm) Model 1885 field guns‚Äîlight breech-loading rifled cannon using black-powder ammunition.Gilman, Daniel, Peck, Harry, et al. (ed.), The New International Encyclopedia: Artillery, Vol. II, New York: Dodd, Mead & Co. (1902), p. 71 The relatively short range of the American gun battery‚Äîtogether with the signature cloud of black smoke generated with each volley‚Äîforced gun crews to endure a fusillade of Mauser rifle fire from the Spanish defenders. General Lawton's initial decision to continually shift the battery's fire to multiple targets resulted in minimal effect on the Spanish strongpoints.Tucker, Spencer C., The Encyclopedia of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican Wars, Santa Barbara CA: ABC-CLIO Press (2009), p. 200 Continued assaults took a heavy toll of the attackers. During the fighting, General Vara del Rey was wounded in both legs. While being evacuated on a stretcher, Vara del Rey and his escorts came under intense American fire. Vara del Rey and several Spanish officers accompanying the group (including one of the General's sons) were killed by American fire as they tried to evacuate.Fernando Puell De La Villa, F. Martinez Canales, EL DESASTRE DE CUBA, 1898 (GUERREROS Y BATALLAS), Editorial Almena His body was later found after the battle by a group of Spanish officers sent to locate him, and he was buried nearby. Despite Vara del Rey's death, Spanish resistance continued. After an initial repulse, Lawton ordered his battery of four 3.2-inch guns, commanded by Capt. Allyn Capron, to concentrate fire on the El Viso strongpoint in the Spanish defenses.Tucker, p. 200 Capron's guns successfully breached the strongpoint walls at a range of 1,000 yards. An attack was then launched by two U.S. infantry regiments, the 12th Infantry and the 25th Infantry, and after a bloody firefight, El Viso was captured. Private T. C. Butler, Company H, 25th Infantry, was the first man to enter the blockhouse at El Caney, and took possession of the Spanish colors. Once El Viso was taken, the U.S. battery reduced each Spanish strongpoint in turn. The fighting ended about 5:00pm with the withdrawal of the Spanish troops. Aftermath Though eventually successful, the attack on the fortifications of El Caney had proved to be of little real value. The attack on two strongly defended points at both El Caney and San Juan diluted the strength of American forces, resulting in delays and additional casualties. About 185 Spanish escaped to the north, but Vara del Rey, his two sons, and his brother perished. One of the Spanish wounded was Colonel Salvador Diaz Ord√≥√±ez, who commanded the Spanish artillery and was the designer of the Ord√≥√±ez guns that the Spanish used as coastal artillery in Cuba. Approximately 400‚Äì600 of the retreating Spanish defenders at El Caney later participated in a hastily organized counterattack against troopers of the U.S. 3rd Cavalry and the 1st Volunteer Cavalry atop Kettle Hill.Parker, John H. (Lt.), The Gatlings At Santiago, Middlesex, UK: Echo Library (reprinted 2006), pp. 59‚Äì61 After closing to within 200 yards of Kettle Hill, they were taken under fire at a range of 600 yards by a single ten-barrel .30 Gatling Gun atop San Juan Hill manned by Sgt. Green of the Gatling Gun Detachment. According to Spanish commanders captured after the battle, all but 40 of the 600 attacking Spanish troops were killed by the Gatling gun fire.Parker, John H. (Lt.), The Gatlings At Santiago, pp. 59‚Äì61: Capt. Henry Marcotte, U.S. Army (ret.), correspondent of the Army and Navy Journal who accompanied the Gatling Gun Detachment, stated that Spanish officers in charge of the counter-attack against Kettle Hill told him that the enemy consisted of about 600 troops who had withdrawn from El Caney, and whose attack was repulsed by machine gun fire so effective that only forty troops ever got back to Santiago, the rest being killed. General Vara del Rey's body was relocated where it had been buried and was exhumed five months after the battle by a Spanish commission. The commission members were accompanied by Cuban Captain Alberto Plochet and a sergeant, who recognized the general by his insignia, his long beard, and an enormous Remington bullet hole in his skull.

His literary work, which had a profound influence on the Bolivian social thought in the first half of the twentieth century, addresses issues related to national identity, miscegenation, and indigenous affairs. His most significant work, Raza de bronce (\\"Bronze Race\\") (1919), is considered one of the most influential Bolivian literary works and a precursor of indigenism. Background and political and diplomatic roles Son of Fructuoso Arguedas and Sabina Diaz, Arguedas studied in the Ayacucho school and then Law and Political Science (1904) at the Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s and sociology in La Paz. He began working in various forms of media as a student, beginning with the Peruvian newspaper El Comercio, moving on to columns for El Diario, the short- lived Revista de Am√©rica and El Mundial, and eventually becoming deputy editor of El Debate in 1915. As a diplomat, he was second secretary of the Legation of Bolivia in Paris (1910), where he would meet Rub√©n Dar√≠o and Francisco Garcia Calderon and would have as boss the ex-president Ismael Montes. Subsequently, he was sent to London. After returning to Bolivia, he was elected deputy of the Bolivia's Liberal Party in 1916, and served as Bolivian representative to the creation of the League of Nations (1918). He also was consul general in Paris (1922) and minister plenipotentiary in Colombia (1929), where he was dismissed for criticizing the President Hernando Siles (1930). He maintained a critical stance toward certain political administrations, for which he was removed from office, exiled, and even slapped by then-President Germ√°n Busch. He became senator for the department of La Paz and eventually led the Liberal Party. Under the administration of President Enrique Pe√±aranda, he served as Minister of Agriculture, Colonization, and Immigration (1940), and then left for Venezuela as minister plenipotentiary (1941). Writer Arguedas is one of Bolivia's best-known writers. His work describes the relationship between Bolivian society and its indigenous peoples, often cynically. Through his books, full of social analysis, he sought a solution for his country's permanent state of conflict. Some of the issues for which he contributed a significant amount of thought‚Äîconflicts between cultures, the complexities of mestizaje, and the sometimes violent relationship between the indigenous and creole/mestizo worlds‚Äîwere later taken up by other currents of thought, including indigenismo, albeit from a different perspective. His first literary works date from his student days, and the first book he published was Pisagua, a novel which appeared in 1903. In the subsequent year, he wrote Wata-Wara. His novelistic production would continue with Vida criolla (1912) and culminate with Raza de bronce. His essay Pueblo enfermo (\\"sick people\\" or \\"sick town\\"), published in Barcelona in 1909, solidified his importance in Latin American letters, earning praise from major writers such as Miguel de Unamuno and Amado Nervo. However, it created controversy in Bolivia, and Franz Tamayo responded critically to his ideas in a series of editorials that would later be compiled as his book Pedagog√≠a de la educaci√≥n nacional. Arguedas coined the term \\"radical pessimism\\" for his stance on indigenous issues, explaining that it came from \\"a mixture of fatal biological laws, historical reasons and environmental circumstances [that] have made the indigenous an atrophied or infirm race\\".Jos√© Miguel Oviedo. Historia de la literatura hispanoamericana. 3. Postmodernismo, Vanguardia, Regionalismo, Alianza Editorial, Madrid, 2001, p.115 Unsurprisingly, some critics identify Arguedas with some of the more distasteful aspects of the Bolivia of his time and reject his relationship with indigenismo However, in his most important novel, Raza de bronce (\\"Bronze Race\\"), Arguedas lays out several themes that would later be instrumental in the development of Bolivian literature: the creole-mestizo oppression against indigenous peoples, their capacity to rise in the face of these abuses, the social placement of the \\"cholo-mestizo\\" (a term, now more commonly a slur, for those mestizos whose indigenous parentage exceeds their European), and the rift between creole and indigenous societies in Bolivia. Arguedas worked on this novel almost until his death. Although he published his first edition in 1919, he continued correcting and re-editing it until he released the definitive edition in 1945. The plot of Raza de bronce is an evolution of his second novel, Wata-Wara, which went relatively unnoticed at the time of publication. In retrospect, despite widespread criticism, it was listed by experts as one of the essential works of Bolivian literature. Over the years, Arguedas found history to be a more direct medium for reflecting upon and interpreting Bolivian social reality. His first historical book, La fundaci√≥n de la Rep√∫blica, was published in 1920. This marked a turning point in Arguedas's life: from here, history and politics came to the fore and his work in literature became secondary. The first volume of his Historia general de Bolivia was published two years later under the auspices of industrialist and millionaire Simon I. Patino. He completed only five of the eight projected volumes of that collection, ranging from the colonial period to its violent 19th-century era of caudillismo. Arguedas received the Rome Prize in France for his autobiographical book La danza de las sombras in 1935. Death He died in Chulumani, a district of La Paz.

Fakhita and Hizam had 10 children: Hakim (Fakhita took by her kunya Umm Hakim and Hizam took by his kunya Abu Hakim), Hizam, Hisham, Khalid, Abdullah, Yahya, Umm Hashim (Hashima), Umm Amr (Amira), Umm Sumaya (Sumaya), Umm Khawla (Khawla). It was said that he was born within the Kaaba enclosure of Mecca, only one person being true to be born in Kabba. He married his cousin, Zaynab bint al-Awwam ibn Khuwaylid, and they had at least three sons: Abdullah, Khalid (from whom he took his kunya Abu Khalid) and Yahya. He had a fourth son, Hisham, who may have been another son of Zaynab; but an alternative tradition names this son's mother as Mulayka bint Malik of the Al-Harith clan of the Quraysh.

He was the original purchaser of the slave Zayd ibn Harithah, for whom he paid 400 dirhams and whom he gave to Khadija. Among his acts of charity, he manumitted a hundred slaves and he slaughtered a hundred camels to distribute in alms.Bukhari 3:46:715.Muslim 1:225. His house was part of the same building as Khadija's; and his uncle Awwam ibn Khuwaylid lived next door. Hence, when Muhammad married Khadija, Hakim became his near neighbour. Early Islam (610‚Äì630) When Muhammad declared himself to be a prophet in 610, Hakim took no interest. He was neither a strong ally nor a leader among the opposition. It is said that at the time of the boycott of the Hashim clan (616-619), Hakim sold flour to his aunt Khadija. On his way to deliver it, he met Abu Jahl, who restrained him and said: \\"Are you taking food to the Hashim clan? Before you and your food move from here, I will denounce you in Mecca!\\" Hakim's cousin Abu'l-Bakhtari arrived on the scene, asked what was going on and told Abu Jahl that he should let Hakim deliver his aunt's own food. Abu Jahl still refused, and the quarrel came to blows. Abu'l-Bakhtari hit Abu Jahl with a camel's jaw, knocking him to the ground, and trod on him.The qualification \\"It is said\\" is Ibn Ishaq's. Nevertheless, in September 622 (after Khadija's death and the Second pledge at al-Aqabah), Hakim was among the council of elders who plotted to assassinate Muhammad. He fought with the Meccans at the Battle of Badr. In later life he was very reluctant to speak about this.Muhammad ibn Umar al-Waqidi. Kitab al- Maghazi. Translated by Faizer, R. (2011). The Life of Muhammad. London & New York: Routledge. On being pressed for information, he claimed that he had hated marching towards Badr; that it was all Satan‚Äôs fault; and that he had seen the angels who assisted the Muslims in the battle. When he heard that Abu Sufyan's caravan had been saved, he urged the Quraysh to make peace with Muhammad. Nevertheless, he was not among those who turned back to Mecca; he fought the battle, and bore witness that the Quraysh were defeated when Muhammad threw a handful of pebbles at them. He continued to advance even when it was obvious that the battle was over. Eventually two of his cousins overtook him and carried him home on their camel. Hakim was present at the killing of Khubayb bin Adi in Mecca in 625. Khubayb's dying prayer was: \\"O Allah, count them all and kill them one by one. Do not leave even one of them.\\" Hakim was so frightened by this prayer that he hid himself in a tree. Conversion to Islam When the Quraysh expected Muhammad to invade Mecca, Abu Sufyan went out by night scouting for information about Muhammad's movements, and Hakim was one of his assistants. But they did not learn anything useful. Hakim was taken by surprise when he was approached by Muhammad's uncle Al-Abbas, who warned him that Muhammad had brought an army of ten thousand. \\"Convert! I will protect you until you reach Allah's Messenger, for I fear that you may be cut to pieces before you reach him.\\" Hakim accompanied Al-Abbas to Muhammad's tent, where he was interrogated and his declaration of faith was accepted. The next day, he assisted Abu Sufyan in shouting to the Meccans: \\"O people of the Quraysh, why are you killing yourselves? Anyone who enters his house is protected. Anyone who lays down his weapons is protected.\\" The people heeded their call and ran to their houses. Later that day, Hakim's four sons all converted to Islam. Hakim fought with Muhammad at the Battle of Hunayn. Afterwards, when Muhammad was distributing gifts to his new followers \\"to win over their hearts,\\" Hakim asked for a gift of a hundred camels, and then another hundred, and then a third hundred. Muhammad obliged him, but at the third donation he said: \\"Hakim, this wealth is sweet greenness. Whoever takes it with generosity of soul will be blessed by it. Whoever takes it with pride will not be blessed by it, like a man who eats but is not satisfied. The upper hand [that gives] is better than the lower hand [that receives]. When you begin, start with your dependants!\\" Hakim then declared, \\"From this moment, I will never take anything from anyone!\\" He took the first hundred camels and departed. Later, when Umar tried to give him gifts, he would not accept them.See also Nasa'i 3:23:2532. Hakim's family then emigrated to Medina and settled there. Narration of Hadith Hakim consulted Muhammad on matters related to trade. As he narrated: \\"I bought some food and made food [i.e., cooked it] and made a profit on it before I took possession of it. I came to Allah's Messenger and told him about that. He said: 'Do not sell it until you take possession of it.'\\"Nasa'i 5:44:4607. This hadith is considered very important in the development of Islamic contract law as it deals with the issue of short selling, options or futures contracts. He narrated Muhammad's teaching: \\"The seller and the buyer have the right to keep or return goods as long as they have not parted or till they part; and if both the parties spoke the truth and described the defects and qualities, then they would be blessed in their transaction, and if they told lies or hid something, then the blessings of their transaction would be lost.\\"Bukhari 3:34:293. On being asked, Muhammad told Hakim that all his good deeds performed before he became a Muslim remained credited to him afterwards.Bukhari 3:34:423; 3:46:715. After his conversion, Hakim freed another hundred slaves and donated another hundred camels in alms. He also reported Muhammad's prohibition on taking retaliation, reciting verses or inflicting hudud punishments inside a mosque.Abu Dawud 39:4475. Later life In 656, when his cousin Al-Zubayr died leaving 2,200,000 (presumably dirhams) in debt, Hakim offered to relieve the family; however, it is not clear how much money he was offering them, as they did not accept anything.Bukhari 1:202. When Marwan was appointed Governor of Medina in 662, Hakim was one of the welcoming party of elders who officially greeted him. Before Islam Hakim had bought for a bargain price the door to Mecca's town hall. In the reign of Muawiyah I he sold it for 100,000 dirhams. The Caliph accused him of \\"selling his family's honour for a hundred thousand.\\" Hakim countered that modern nobility was measured by piety, and since he intended to donate the full proceeds to charity, nobody had been cheated. The Caliph asked him what food he ate, and he replied that he no longer had teeth. Soon afterwards, Muawiyah sent him a camel so that he could drink its milk, together with a cash present. Hakim returned the money with a reminder that he had never accepted his allotted share from the state treasury since the death of Muhammad. He died in Medina in 674, claiming an age of 120 years.

He is widely recognized as one of Australia's greatest writers. He was awarded the Neustadt International Prize for Literature in 2000, his 1993 novel Remembering Babylon won the International Dublin Literary Award in 1996, he won the inaugural Australia-Asia Literary Award in 2008, and he was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In 2016, he received the Australia Council Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, David Malouf was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as an \\"Influential Artist\\".  Personal life  Malouf was born in Brisbane, Australia, to a Christian Lebanese father and an English-born mother of Portuguese Sephardi Jewish descent. His paternal family had immigrated from Lebanon in the 1880s, while his mother's family had moved to England via the Netherlands, before migrating to Australia in 1913. He is openly gay and has one sister, Jill Phillips. He was an avid reader as a child, and at 12 years old was reading such books as Wuthering Heights, Bleak House and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.Gilling, Tom, \\"David Malouf: Writer\\", The Weekend Australian Magazine, 2‚Äì3 August 2008, p. 28 These books, he says, taught him about sex: \\"They told you there was a life out there that was amazingly passionate\\". He attended Brisbane Grammar School and graduated from the University of Queensland in 1955. He lectured for a short period before moving to London, where he taught at Holland Park School before relocating to Birkenhead in 1962. He returned to Australia in 1968, taught at his old school, and lectured in English at the Universities of Queensland and Sydney. He has lived in England and Tuscany; for the past three decades, most of his time has been spent in Sydney. Like many writers, he values his privacy and enjoyed living in Tuscany \\"where he could think and write in anonymity\\". Career His first novel, Johnno (1975), is the semi-autobiographical tale of a young man growing up in Brisbane during World War II. It was adapted for the stage by La Boite Theatre in 2004. In 1982, his novella about three acquaintances and their experience of World War I, Fly Away Peter, won The Age Book of the Year fiction prize. His epic novel The Great World (1990) tells the story of two Australians and their relationship amid the turmoil of two World Wars, including imprisonment by the Japanese during World War II; the novel won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and the French Prix Femina √âtranger. His Booker Prize-shortlisted novel Remembering Babylon (1993) is set in northern Australia during the 1850s amid a community of English immigrant farmers (with one Scottish family) whose isolated existence is threatened by the arrival of a stranger, a young white man raised from boyhood by Indigenous Australians. It also won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize (South East Asia and South Pacific Region, Best Book), and in 1996, it won the first International Dublin Literary Award. In 2007, his short-story collection Every Move You Make won The Age Book of the Year Award for Fiction and the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards, Australian Short Story Collection ‚Äì Arts Queensland Steele Rudd Award. Australian critic Peter Craven described it as \\"as formidable and bewitching a collection of stories as you would be likely to find anywhere in the English-speaking world\\". He goes on to say that \\"No one else in this country has: the maintenance of tone, the expertness of prose, the easeful transition between lyrical and realist effects. The man is a master, a superb writer, and also (which is not the same thing) a completely sophisticated literary gent\\". Malouf has written several volumes of poetry, three collections of short stories, and a play, Blood Relations (1988). He has written libretti for three operas (including Voss, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Patrick White and first produced in the 1986 Adelaide Festival of Arts conducted by Stuart Challender), and Baa Baa Black Sheep (with music by Michael Berkeley), which combines a semi-autobiographical story by Rudyard Kipling with Kipling's Jungle Books. His memoirs, 12 Edmondstone Street, were published in 1985. Malouf was awarded the Pascall Prize for Critical Writing in 1988. In 2008, Malouf won the Australian Publishers Association's Lloyd O'Neil Award for outstanding service to the Australian book industry\\"Brooks wins Book of the Year award\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 15 June 2008 He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2008. Malouf says, on being a writer: \\"I totally reject the idea of being representative in any way. This whole idea of role models. It's a terrible idea. I don't like the idea of being some kind of representative consciousness of the country. You do what you do, the way you do it, out of a kind of necessity. I can't see how that would be useful to anyone else\\". Themes and subject matter Malouf's writing is characterised by a heightened sense of spatial relations, from the physical environments into which he takes his readers‚Äîwhether within or outside built spaces, or in a natural landscape. He has likened each of his succession of novels to the discovery and exploration of a new room in a house, rather than part of an overarching development. \\"At a certain point, you begin to see what the connections are between things, and you begin to know what space it is you are exploring.\\", accessed 30 August 2009 From his first book Johnno, his themes have focused on \\"male identity and soul-searching\\". He said that much of the male writing that preceded him \\"was about the world of action. I don't think that was ever an accurate description of men's lives\\". He believes that it was Patrick White who turned this around in Australian writing‚Äîthat White's writing was the kind \\"that goes behind inarticulacy and or unwillingness to speak, writing that gives the language of feeling to people who don't have it themselves\\". He said that \\"I knew that the world around you is only uninteresting if you can't see what is really going on. The place you come from is always the most exotic place you'll ever encounter because it is the only place where you recognise how many secrets and mysteries there are in people's lives\\". However, after nearly four decades of writing, he has concluded that in older writers there's sometimes \\"a fading of the intensity of the imagination, and ... of the interest in the tiny details of life and behaviour‚Äîyou see [writers] getting a bit impatient with that.\\", accessed 30 August 200.9 Bibliography =Novels= An Imaginary Life (1978) * Fly Away Peter (1982) * Child's Play (1982) * Harland's Half Acre (1984) * The Great World (1990) * Remembering Babylon (1993) * The Conversations at Curlow Creek (1996) * Ransom (2009) =Short story collections= * Antipodes (1983) * Untold Tales (1999) * Dream Stuff (2000) * Every Move You Make (2006) * The Complete Stories (2007; Australia- Asia Literary Award) =Poetry collections= * Bicycle and Other Poems (1970) * Neighbours in a Thicket: Poems (1974) * Poems 1975‚Äì76 (1976) * Wild Lemons: Poems (1980) * Selected Poems 1959‚Äì1989 (1994) * Guide to the Perplexed and Other Poems (2007) * Typewriter Music (2007) * Revolving Days (2008) * Winner: Kenneth Slessor Prize for Poetry, New South Wales Premier's Awards. =Non- fiction= * 12 Edmondstone St (memoirs ‚Äì 1985) * \\"A Spirit of Play: The Making of Australian Consciousness\\", Boyer Lectures (1998) \\"Made in England\\" (Quarterly Essay, Black Inc ‚Äì 2003) * On Experience (Little Books on Big Themes ‚Äì 2008) * \\"The Happy Life\\" (Quarterly Essay, Black Inc ‚Äì 2011) * The Writing Life: Book 2 (2014) =Plays= * Blood Relations (1988) =Libretti= * Voss (1986) * Mer de glace (1991) * Baa Baa Black Sheep (1993) * Jane Eyre (2000) References Further reading *Giffuni, Cathe. \\"The Prose of David Malouf\\", Australian & New Zealand Studies in Canada, No. 7 June 1992.

This included large cash incentives to the cathedral chapter and a promise that Sigismund would be a very hands off ruler. After the 1662 death of his brother Archduke Ferdinand Charles, he became Archduke of Further Austria, and therefore withdrew from the candidacy for the bishopric. He was more able than his brother and could have made him a good ruler, but with his early death in 1665 the younger Tyrolean line of the Habsburg house ended.

The label was in operation from 1969 to 1979. Janus was founded in July 1969 as a joint venture of GRT and British label Pye Records.\\"GRT, Canada, Go Into Discs, Distribute Five More Labels.\\" Billboard, August 9, 1969.

Its first major hit was \\"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\\" by Jefferson, in late 1969. Other acts in Janus' early years included Pye artists Status Quo, Pickettywitch and Sounds Orchestral. Up to the early 1970s, the label's president was Marvin Schlactner, who later ran the ill-fated U.S. Pye label, which by 1976 evolved into Prelude Records. GRT assumed sole ownership of Janus in 1971, after Pye pulled out of the venture.\\"Pye May Quit Janus As GRT Is Reshuffled\\" by Mike Gross. Billboard, March 20, 1971.

Allan Mason was Vice President in charge of A&R.; Artists who had hits on Janus included Potliquor, Mungo Jerry, The Whispers, Cymande, Charlie, Al Stewart, Ian Thomas, Dickie Goodman and Ray Stevens on Barnaby Records. Janus also released Scott English's original recording of \\"Brandy\\", which would be covered in 1974 by Barry Manilow as \\"Mandy\\". Chess Records was administered as a division of Janus in the early 1970s. Janus also distributed Westbound Records from 1970 until 1975, and Barnaby Records from 1974 to 1979. In the early 1970s Janus also released American editions of recordings made by Bill Haley & His Comets for the European Sonet Records label (including the 1971 single \\"A Little Piece at a Time\\" (Janus 162), which would be Haley's final North American 45 rpm single release).

He was the inventor of the Odhner Arithmometer, which by the 1940s was one of the most popular type of portable mechanical calculator in the world.Trogemann G., Nitussov A.: Computing in Russia, page 39-45, GWV-Vieweg, 2001, According to a brochure distributed by Odhner's company at the Paris World exposition of 1900 \\"...Odhner had, in 1871, an opportunity to repair a Thomas calculating machine and then became convinced that it is possible to solve the problem of mechanical calculation by a simpler and more appropriate way\\". It took him 19 years to perfect the design of this new machine so it could be manufactured effectively. Early years Odhner studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from 1864 to 1867 but left before graduating. At age 23, in 1868, he moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, even though he didn't speak any Russian. As soon as he arrived, he went to the Swedish consulate, which found him a job in a local mechanical workshop. A few months later he joined the Nobel's mechanical factory owned by a Swede named Ludvig Nobel (1831‚Äì1888), brother of Alfred Nobel of Nobel Prize fame, where he worked until 1877. In 1878 he joined the Expedition, a large paper mill and printing house, and worked there until 1892. Manufacturing of the Arithmometer While working at the Expedition, Odhner started his own workshop in 1885, building high quality production machines for local manufacturing businesses. One of his biggest project was the manufacturing of printing presses, he also made cigarette-making machines and all kind of scientific instruments. Odhner officially started the production of his arithmometer in this workshop in 1890. Early on, Mr. F. N. Hill, a British citizen, became his associate but he left the company around 1897, making Odhner the sole proprietor until his death in 1905. After Odhner's death, his sons Alexander and Georg and son-in- law Karl Siewert continued the production and about 23,000 calculators were made before the factory was forced to close down in 1918. Independent clone makers from all over the world, including Russia, carried the design from 1893 well into the 1970s. An early machine built by W.T. Odhner in St. Petersburg before 1900 Family In 1871 he married Alma Sk√•nberg the daughter of Fredrik Sk√•nberg, a Nobel coworker. They had seven children. Unfortunately Emilia, their second child, died at age 2 in 1877, the same year Alma, their third child was born. W. T. Odhner died of a heart attack on 15 September 1905 (Gregorian calendar) in Saint Petersburg, Russia. See also * Timeline of computing Notes External links * Timo Leip√§l√§: The life and works of W.

His earlier books were published under the name Brian M. Stableford, but more recent ones have dropped the middle initial and appeared under the name Brian Stableford. He has also used the pseudonym Brian Craig for a couple of very early works, and again for a few more recent works.

Biography =Early life and education= Kay is a native of New York and a nephew of actor Danny Aiello. A big fan of the Yankees, Kay wore number 1 in Little League for his favorite player, Bobby Murcer. Wanting to be the Yankees announcer when he grew up, he did all the school reports that he could about the Yankees, so he could know all about them.Foward-Pinstripe Pride-by Marty Appel Kay began reporting as a youth at the Bronx High School of Science and then at Fordham University for WFUV. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in communications from Fordham. =Broadcasting career= Kay started his professional career with the New York Post in 1982 as a general assignment writer, with sports-specific assignments to college basketball, the National Basketball Association and the New Jersey Nets coming over time. He received the Yankees' beat writing assignment in 1987. In 1989, Kay left the Post for the Daily News, still primarily working on the Yankees. At this time, Kay also served as the Madison Square Garden Network Yankee reporter starting in 1989. From 1992-99, he served as MSG's locker room reporter for the New York Knicks. He had previously worked for the network as a contributor on the news-format sports show MSG SportsDesk. Kay left the Daily News to host a sports talk show on WABC in 1992, briefly returning to write \\"Kay's Korner\\" for the Daily News in 1993, before taking the microphone job for radio broadcasts of New York Yankee games beside John Sterling. =Announcer for the New York Yankees (1992-present)= Paul O'Neill, Ken Singleton, and Ryan Ruocco providing play- by-play commentary for the Yankees on YES. Kay spent a decade partnered with Sterling as the radio announcers of the team on WABC from 1992 to 2001.\\"YES Network announcer bio\\", yesnetwork.com; accessed March 28, 2018. Kay and Sterling also paired together in 1998 for Sports Talk with John Sterling and Michael Kay, a nightly radio show which aired on WABC. During the baseball season, the duo hosted Yankee Talk, a weekend pre-game radio show. From 1992 to 1993 Kay hosted his own show on WABC. Kay continued during that time as a spot reporter on ABC Radio, doing off-season shows with Sterling and as a fill-in sports reporter on WABC-TV. When ESPN Radio began leasing (and later purchasing) WEVD radio in 2001, Kay was chosen to host a daily radio show on the newly rechristened \\"1050 ESPN Radio\\". When WCBS acquired the radio rights to the Yankees broadcasts in 2002, Kay moved to the debuting YES Network on television and Sterling remained on the radio. Kay has been the Yankees' lead television play-by-play announcer ever since. Kay has worked with a series of partners on YES, often with three or four different partners in the same season. Most have been former professional players, including Ken Singleton, David Cone, Al Leiter, Paul O'Neill, Jim Kaat, John Flaherty, Joe Girardi, Lou Piniella, and Bobby Murcer. Kay calls approximately 125 games a year for the YES Network and local television affiliates like Pix 11 in New York City. In 2008, Major League Baseball invited Kay to call the Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium during that year's All Star festivities. On September 21, 2008, he joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan to call the seventh inning of ESPN's broadcast of the final home game at Yankee Stadium against the Baltimore Orioles. According to Miller, Kay was brought in because ESPN felt that they should include the local aspects of broadcasting for the Yankees for this special game, as the YES Network was not allowed to cover the game.

Since the late 1990s, Kay and Sterling have co-emceed such events as the Yankees' annual Old-Timers' Day ceremonyMarisa Scolamiero (July 19, 2009). \\"New York Yankees Tradition: Old-Timers' Day Still a Hit\\", Bleacher Report; accessed March 28, 2018. as well as players' number retirements, anniversary celebrations for the team's World Series victories, and the City Hall celebrations after Yankees' World Series victories. =Other announcing work= Kay and Sterling also provided play-by-play commentary for Nintendo 64's All-Star Baseball video games from 1999 to 2001. In addition to his Yankees work, Kay has called play-by-play of several postseason games on ESPN Radio, including the 2008 NLDS between the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers, the 2013 ALDS between the Detroit Tigers and Oakland Athletics, and Game 3 of the 2016 ALDS between the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays. The Michael Kay Show Kay at Yankee Stadium in 2010 In 2002, he began hosting a drive-time talk show on WEPN (the former WEVD). The show is now co-hosted by Don La Greca and Peter Rosenberg. That same year, he also hosts the YES Network's CenterStage, a sports and entertainment interview- format show. During baseball season, Kay frequently broadcasts live from the vicinity of the stadium that the Yankees are playing in that evening. (Contractual exclusivity prohibits him from hosting the show from inside Yankee Stadium). From 2009 until 2011, the 6:00 hour had been co-titled New York Baseball Tonight throughout the baseball season. Kay did not usually appear during that hour if he was broadcasting a Yankee game that evening. Don La Greca often hosted this segment and appeared with Kay on the rest of The Michael Kay Show. When Kay is on the air for the end of his program, he usually signs off with the following: \\"In the words of Billy Joel, life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, and I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again,\\" before promoting the following program. Kay opened his first ever simulcast on the YES Network on February 3, 2014 by dumping a bottle of Diet Coke into the garbage, a move meant to poke fun of the channel's former occupant Mike Francesa. The canned action was widely criticized. =Personal life= Kay married television journalist Jodi Applegate on February 12, 2011, with former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani officiating. Guests included former Yankees such as Al Leiter, Tino Martinez, Paul O'Neill, actor Robert DeNiro, actor Bobby Cannavale, and actor/uncle Danny Aiello.Matthew Abrahams (February 13, 2011) \\"Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay marries news anchor Jodi Applegate\\".

Awards In 2007, Kay was nominated for a number of New York Emmy Awards for his work with the YES Network, both for Yankees broadcasts and for his highly rated interview program Centerstage.

Greider then worked for the Louisville Times, and was sent to Washington, D.C. in 1966 to cover Washington for the Times and for the Louisville Courier-Journal.

Greider also wrote a book on globalization ‚Äì One World, Ready or Not: The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism (1997) ‚Äì which suggested vulnerabilities and inequities of the global economy. The credibility of this work was heavily criticized by economist Paul Krugman, who claimed that Greider ignored the fallacies of composition that run rampant in the work, misinterpreted facts (some of which were incorrect), and misled readers with false assumptions ‚Äì all possibly due to his lack of consultation with economists.

On 11 June 2013, the Greek government announced the closure of the state broadcaster ERT from 12 June 2013 as an austerity measure. As of 24 June 2013, The Voice of Greece from ERT Open was broadcasting intermittently again on shortwave on 9420 kHz, 9935 kHz, 11645 kHz, but the live online streaming internet transmission had not resumed. A live internet broadcast stream began operating again in mid-2015 at the link below.Live Streaming History The first state radio of Greece the \\"Athens Radio\\" was inaugurated in spring 1938 with a 15 kW transmitter at Liosia suburb and studios of the Zappeion Mansion. The first attempt for establishing a shortwave radio station took place immediately after the Greco-Italian War broke out in October 1940. Athens Radio programmes were transmitted from a small transmitter in the centre of Athens to the front and the Balkans. A special Short Wave programme was created after the German- Italian occupation in 1947: transmissions began from a 7.5 kW transmitter to Cyprus, Egypt, Turkey, the Balkans and the Soviet Union, while four transmissions were made to Greek navigators. The daily news bulletins were broadcast in 12 foreign languages (Arabic, German, Russian, Spanish, Romanian, Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Albanian, French, Polish, English) and once a week in Arabic. A music programme was also broadcast. The short wave transmission centre was established in 1972 with two 110 kW transmitters and in Avlis - northeast of Athens - with transmitting antennas directed to the five continents. After the collapse of the military junta in 1975, the Short Wave programme was named \\"The Voice of Greece\\" and came under the then Radio News Management. Almost 15 years later, with the institutionalization and implementation of the Unified ERT body, it became autonomous and was named \\"The Fifth Programme - The Voice of Greece\\", coming under the ERA General Management. Profile It is a voice that reaches the whole planet since ERA 5 transmits to 14 basic geographical destinations of the globe. The voice of ERA 5 meets no borders. It is heard in all five continents, where Greeks live, from the Balkans and the rest of Europe to Africa, Japan, the United States and Australia. It transmits at short wavelength (9420 kHz, 9935 kHz and 11645 kHz) continually for 23 hours and at a medium wave for about 10 hours. 19 Greek bulletins are broadcast from the studios of ERA 5 on a daily basis. The programme also includes informative programmes of political, cultural and folklore interest, as well as musical programmes that promote good Greek songs. But ERA 5 is mainly characterized by programmes that bring it to direct contact with Hellenism through telephone calls and letters. In parallel, ERA5 is not only intended for the Greeks living abroad, but also for foreigners living in Greece and abroad. It accomplishes this through a daily programme in many languages at short and medium wavelengths. This programme is transmitted in 12 languages: English, German, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Albanian, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian, Turkish and Arabic. Thus, ERA5 becomes a source of a timely and direct briefing of the various developments in Greece and the world. The Voice of Greece is intended for the millions of Greeks living in the five continents, for the hundreds of thousands of Greek students mainly in Europe and the USA, for the tens of thousands of Greek sailors at sea, as well as for the numerous Greeks living abroad, who are not speaking Greek and for foreign listeners. The Voice of Greece has also joined the world community of the Internet with live transmission of its programme 24 hours a day. With a special programme intended for the Greeks living abroad, and with a unique and complete bulletin intended for them and with its transmission to the World Wide Web, ERA 5 reaches the Greeks living in all parts of the world.

In 1978, Sequential released the Prophet-5, the first programmable polyphonic synthesizer, used by artists including Michael Jackson, Madonna, and John Carpenter. Sequential was also pivotal to the development of MIDI in 1982, which synchronizes electronic instruments by different manufacturers. In 1987, Sequential went out of business and was purchased by Yamaha. Smith continued to develop instruments through a new company, Dave Smith Instruments. In 2015, Yamaha returned the Sequential Circuits trademark to Dave Smith Instruments, which rebranded as Sequential in 2018.  History  = 1974 ‚Äî1980: Founding and first Prophets = Engineer Dave Smith founded Sequential Circuits in San Francisco in 1974. The first Sequential Circuits product was an analog sequencer for use with Moog and ARP synthesizers, followed by a digital sequencer and the Model 700 Programmer, which allowed for programming on Minimoog and ARP 2600. The Model 800, launched in 1975, was controlled and programmed with a microprocessor. The Prophet-5 (1978), the first Sequential synthesizerAt the same time, Smith had a full-time job working with microprocessors, then a new technology, and conceived the idea of combining them with synthesizer chips to create a programmable synthesizer. In early 1977, he quit his job to work full-time on a design for the Prophet-5, a programmable polyphonic synthesizer. He demonstrated it at NAMM in January 1978 and shipped the first models later that year. Unlike its nearest competitor, the Yamaha CS-80, the Prophet-5 had patch memory, allowing users to store sounds rather than having to reprogram them manually. The Prophet-5 became a market leader and industry standard. It has been used by pop and hip hop musicians such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Dr Dre, and by film composers such as John Carpenter. It was followed by the larger Prophet-10, which was less successful as it was notorious for unreliability. The smaller Pro-One, essentially a monophonic Prophet-5, saw more success. = 1981‚Äî1982: MIDI = Prophet 600 (1982), the first Sequential Circuits synthesizer with MIDI functionality In 1981, Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi contacted Smith about creating a standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments manufactured by different companies. Smith and Sequential engineer Chet Wood designed an interface using Roland's Digital Control Bus (DCB) as a basis. This standard was discussed and modified by representatives of Roland, Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai.Holmes, Thom. Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition. New York: Routledge, 2003 The protocol was named Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and unveiled by Kakehashi and Smith, who received Technical Grammy Awards in 2013 for their work. In 1982, Sequential released the Prophet 600, one of the first MIDI-equipped synthesizers. = 1987: Closure = In 1987, Sequential Circuits went out of business. Smith blamed the decision to move to computer audio in 1985: \\"We were too small and under-capitalized, and we were a few years too early in the market ... It drained our resources, so by the time we pulled back to professional instruments, it was too late.\\" Sequential Circuits was purchased by Yamaha, who shut it down in 1989. Smith moved to Korg, where he worked mainly on the Wavestation synthesizer. = 2002 ‚Äî2014: Dave Smith Instruments = In 2002, after several years working on software synthesis, Smith opened a new company, Dave Smith Instruments (DSI), to build new hardware. Its first product was the Evolver synthesizer in 2002. In 2008, DSI launched the Prophet '08, conceived as an affordable analog eight-voice synthesizer. = 2015 ‚Äîpresent: return to Sequential = In January 2015, Yamaha returned the Sequential Circuits brands to Smith in a goodwill gesture. This was at the encouragement of Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi, who had worked with Smith to create MIDI. Kakehashi said: \\"I feel that it‚Äôs important to get rid of unnecessary conflict among electronic musical instrument companies. That is exactly the spirit of MIDI. For this reason, I personally recommended that the President of Yamaha, Mr. Nakata, return the rights to the Sequential name to Dave Smith.\\" In 2015, Smith announced the Prophet-6, described as a spiritual successor to the Prophet-5. In May 2018, Sequential announced the Prophet-X, featuring both sample playback and digitally controlled oscillators. On August 31, 2018, the 40th anniversary of the Prophet-5, Dave Smith Instruments rebranded as Sequential. On September 30, 2020, Sequential announced the Prophet-5 rev4 and Prophet-10.

Along with Washington Crossing the Delaware by Emanuel Leutze, the painting is one of the most famous depictions of the early days of the United States. Christy created the painting in April 1940; it is so large (20 √ó 30') that he painted it in a sail loft. It currently is displayed along the east stairway in the House of Representatives wing in the Capitol building. Description Only 39 of the 55 delegates are pictured in the painting; not included are the three delegates who did not sign the Constitution or the 13 delegates who left the convention. On the right side of the painting, on the dais, George Washington, president of the convention, stands upright and looks out over the delegates. The Constitution and the Syng inkstand are on a desk before him, and Richard Spaight of North Carolina is signing the document. The windows are open and an aura of light surrounds Washington's upper body. Behind him are displayed American flags and a drum. Also behind him James Wilson of Pennsylvania and Richard Bassett of Delaware are talking. Behind them on the far right is Delaware delegate George Read; below them is Pennsylvania delegate Robert Morris, and standing slightly to the right of Washington is Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer from Maryland. William Jackson, the convention's secretary, is prominently placed directly in the center. Standing, in red, and holding up four fingers, he apparently is counting the votes. At his left elbow, James Madison observes the proceedings. Between Jackson's right hand and head is William Paterson. Benjamin Franklin is seated in the center, and Alexander Hamilton leans toward him. Standing directly behind Hamilton is Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania. The South Carolina delegation is depicted in the painting's left corner. Also seated on the left, distinguished by their multi- colored silk coats, are Jonathan Dayton, Rufus King (on Dayton's left) and Nathaniel Gorham. Commissioning Representative Sol Bloom, the Director General of the United States Constitution Sesquicentennial Commission, first proposed that the painting be commissioned in 1937 as part of the 150th anniversary of the Constitution. Howard Chandler Christy, one of the most popular illustrators and portrait painters of the time, had created an historically accurate scene of the signing for the commission to reproduce. His first small painting included a maiden representing \\"We the People\\" and numerous other symbolic figures, but these were eliminated in the final version. In the three years during which Representative Bloom worked with Christy to locate early portraits of the signers and to fill in historical details, he became aware that there was no scene of the signing of the Constitution in the U.S. Capitol, and few other paintings in existence included all the signers. A Joint Resolution was first introduced in the House in 1937 to pay Christy $35,000 to paint Signing of the Constitution. Heated debate arose, however: some members of Congress were in favor of memorializing one of the greatest events in American history, but others held deep reservations about spending the funds for art during a period of severe economic depression, and the bill did not pass. The Joint Resolution failed again in 1938. Finally, in 1939, a modified resolution, P.R. 11, 76th Congress, was accepted to set up a commission consisting of the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, and the Architect of the Capitol to employ an artist to paint a 20-by-30-foot scene of the signing at a price of $30,000. The contract with Christy was signed on July 24, 1939. On October 29, 1940, the Congress approved $1500 for the purchase of a frame, which was accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library on December 26, 1940. Research and work To achieve the greatest possible accuracy, Christy searched for portraits by the best artists of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, such as Charles Willson Peale and Gilbert Stuart. He located portraits of thirty-seven out of the thirty-nine delegates and the Secretary, William Jackson. Christy took some liberties in composing his scene: John Dickinson, whose signature was added by proxy, is included, and three men who were present but did not sign are not shown. He obscured the faces of the two signers (Thomas FitzSimons and Jacob Broom) of whom no portraits were found. He also researched authentic costumes, including a pair of George Washington's breeches borrowed from the Smithsonian Institution, and he depicted the furniture and artifacts used by the delegates. The books beside Franklin's chair were part of Thomas Jefferson's library; Christy borrowed them from the Rare Book Room of the Library of Congress and included them in the scene to acknowledge Jefferson's importance to the Constitution. He made the sketch for the painting in Independence Hall in September, at the same time of day as the signing, to show accurately the angle of sunlight in the room with its glass chandelier. The artist said that the flags he depicted are the Stars and Stripes, one from a Maryland dragoon regiment, and regimental colors from Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The huge 18-by-26-foot canvas was painted in the sail loft of the Washington Navy Yard, where Christy at times used enlisted men as models for the figures. After five years of research and seven months of painting, the canvas was dedicated in May 1940 in the Rotunda of the Capitol, where it was on view for 16 months. The 20-by-30-foot frame, made in nine sections including the central eagle and crest, was hand carved and given a gold-leaf finish by Azeglio Pancani of New York. After much debate about where it could be hung, another painting was moved and the Christy in its frame was installed in the east grand stairway of the House, where it remains today. Vandalism and restoration In 1967 the painting was vandalized by being slashed along the bottom; the canvas had to be removed from the stretcher to be transported for repair in 1968. The fills made then were apparent, however, and over time dust, grime, and yellowed varnish obscured the original brilliant colors. In 2006 the painting was cleaned and conserved in place by conservators working from a large four-level scaffold from mid- October through December. The cleaning of areas that had looked dull brown revealed lively expressions, detailed costumes and impressionist colors, such as lavender and pink, applied with scintillating brushwork. The vandalized area was given special attention and is now barely visible. Finally, a new coating of clear protective varnish was applied. The frame, which had been covered with bronze powder paint in 1968, was taken apart in sections and conserved off site. It was cleaned and repaired, regilded with 22-karat gold leaf similar to the color of the original metal leaf, and toned to complement the painting.

Originally a separate borough, Grey Lynn amalgamated with Auckland City in 1914. Grey Lynn is centred on Grey Lynn Park, which was not part of the original subdivision of 1883, since the land was too steep and too wet for house construction. In 1914 the land was drained and levelled for playing fields. The park is home to the annual Grey Lynn Park Festival, which attracts around 100,000 visitors on the third Saturday in November. The character of the area is often seen as \\"arty\\", and one of being a \\"traditional home to free-thinkers and anti-establishment types\\". Demographics Grey Lynn, comprising the statistical areas of Grey Lynn North, Grey Lynn West, Grey Lynn Central and Grey Lynn East, had a population of 11,733 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 891 people (8.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,491 people (14.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 4,173 households. There were 5,751 males and 5,985 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female, with 1,695 people (14.4%) aged under 15 years, 3,291 (28.0%) aged 15 to 29, 5,994 (51.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 753 (6.4%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 78.7% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.7% MƒÅori, 12.4% Pacific peoples, 9.8% Asian, and 3.4% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 29.6%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 60.5% had no religion, 28.2% were Christian, and 6.7% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 4,884 (48.7%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 564 (5.6%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 6,591 (65.7%) people were employed full-time, 1,392 (13.9%) were part-time, and 318 (3.2%) were unemployed. History Grey Lynn takes the first part of its name from Sir George Grey (14 April 1812 ‚Äì 19 September 1898), Governor of South Australia, twice Governor of New Zealand, Governor of Cape Colony (South Africa), Premier of New Zealand, and (towards the end of his life), Member of Parliament for Auckland West. Grey's service as member of parliament for the area was apparently widely appreciated, since following his retirement from politics and death in 1898 the north-western portion of the suburb of Newton was renamed Grey Lynn in his honour. The original subdivision was , which is still the formal extent of Grey Lynn. Most of the houses were built between the 1880s and the beginning of the First World War of 1914‚Äì1918. Very few of the houses have been completely replaced by new structures. Williamson Avenue and Crummer Road are two of the major streets in Grey Lynn. James Williamson and Thomas Crummer jointly owned a farm in the area. In 1883 Williamson and Crummer sold the property to the Auckland Agricultural Company. The Surrey Hills farm was subdivided into 272 building sections to form the neighbourhood between Surrey Crescent and the southern end of Ponsonby Road. Shops are located at the intersection of Great North Road and Williamson Avenue. The developers largely laid out Grey Lynn's streets as straight roads (as opposed to the earlier farm roads such as Richmond Road, which twists and turns following the curve of the landscape.) Several street-names echo the names of early landowners; Williamson, Crummer, Mckelvie, Pollen, Prime etc. But there is a prevalence of cultural personages from Britain: Sir John Millais, Lord Elgin, Alfred Lord Leighton, Coleridge, the Earl of Beaconsfield, Dr Arnold, Dickens, Dryden etc. This was obviously intended to give an artistic ambience to the area. Most of the houses in the area were built between the 1890s and the beginning of the First World War. They were constructed quickly and with little variation in layout. Their fa√ßades were differentiated by the application of mass-produced items; wooden fretwork, stained-glass panels, turned balusters and pressed tin (intended for interior ceilings ‚Äì this \\"new\\" product occasionally appears on the gable ends of some villas). The most important feature was the bay window‚Äîhence the name \\"Bay Villa\\"‚Äîan important feature which marked the owner as middle class. The new inhabitants tended to be young couples, mostly white-collar workers such as clerks and office workers, teachers or skilled crafts-people. The adjacent area north of Richmond Road was probably similar. This was different from the nearby working-class area of Freeman's Bay or from the upper-middle-class area of Herne Bay. Grey Lynn slip, December 1981 By the 1930s and 1940s the original owners were beginning to age and the fussily detailed houses of Grey Lynn on their cramped sections were seen as very old-fashioned and undesirable. The increased ownership of motorcars meant suburban development was expanding exponentially, resulting in the mid-20th century ideal of the quarter-acre section. All the inner suburbs of Auckland became less desirable, and areas like Grey Lynn became very rundown. Many properties became owned by people who lived elsewhere and were often divided into flats or operated as boarding houses. Repairs were kept to a minimum and in some cases houses were not repainted for almost half a century. The fact that so many houses of this period still stand today despite the depredations of fire, rot and borer is an indication of how well they were built. By the 1950s the very low rents in places like Grey Lynn and Ponsonby attracted students and immigrant workers from the Pacific Islands. By the 1960s Grey Lynn had developed a definite Polynesian flavour. Although in recent years this has greatly diminished, there are still a large number of Tongan and Samoan churches in the area. The 1970s saw a renewed interest in older Victorian properties, and from that period onwards many young professionals began buying dilapidated kauri villas in areas like Grey Lynn and renovating them. On 3 December 1981 a landslide destroyed homes around Herringson Avenue and Shirley Road. From the early 1990s this gentrification began to visibly change the area, resulting in an increase in house prices and in higher rents. Major corporate projects have gradually replaced lower-end retail enterprises. An influx of middle-class people has resulted in a reduction of student flats and the slow but steady displacement of Polynesian families. A number of recent housing developments in the suburb have attracted controversy for their perceived contribution to the area's increasing population density. =Mayors (1885‚Äì1914)= Grey Lynn had a local government like other suburbs of Auckland at that time. The local government was called Grey Lynn Borough Council, which started in 1885 and in 1914 merged into Auckland City Council and then merged into Auckland Council in 2010. *Richard T.

It is the last independent community event in the city. The event, which attracts on average 100,000 visitors each year, is organised by four people who raise money from stall fees and charitable grants. It started as a local community get-together with working- class and Pasifika roots, though the appeal has broadened through the decades. Local band Unity Pacific first performed at the festival in 1987, and have appeared many times since. They headlined in 2009. Education and sports Grey Lynn School and Newton Central School are contributing primary (years 1-6) schools with rolls of and , respectively. St Joseph's School is a Catholic state-integrated full primary (years 1-8) school with a roll of . All these schools are coeducational. Rolls are as of Secondary schools serving the area include Auckland Girls' Grammar School, Mount Albert Grammar School, and Western Springs College. Grey Lynn Park is the home ground of the Richmond Rovers rugby league club. Transport The suburb is served by public transport. It lies within walking distance of the central business district via Ponsonby. Buses run down Great North Road, Richmond Road, Surrey Crescent and Williamson Avenue. Notable buildings * Grey Lynn Fire Station: The former Borough Council Chambers and Fire Station. This building is distinguished by a wooden spire (recently restored) which originally housed the fire bell. Standing at the Ponsonby Road end of Williamson Avenue, this brick building dates from 1889, was designed by John Mitchell. It resembles many American fire stations of the period. The upstairs was used as the Borough Council Chamber until the suburb was amalgamated with Auckland City in 1914. * Former Auckland Savings Bank: Located on Ponsonby Road near the intersection with Karangahape Road. This italianate building was designed in 1885 by Edward Bartley ‚Äì originally a single story building it received a second story designed by the same architect in 1900. The former banking chamber is distinguished by the use of New Zealand marble. In the 1920s the lower part of the room was lined with panelling made of Cloudy Bay Marble from Nelson. Currently occupied by an Art Gallery. * Allendale House: At the corner of Crummer Road and Ponsonby Road stands the large 1890s Italianate Mansion of George Allen, a saddle and harness maker. \\"Allendale\\" is a local landmark, having been successively a doctor's surgery, Maori girls hostel, boarding house, refuge for alcoholic men, and a restaurant. In the 1990s it was purchased by the ASB Community Trust as its headquarters and restored. * Carlile House: A large Italianate building at 84 Richmond Road. Built in 1886 as an industrial school named the Costley Training Institute as part of the bequest of Edward Costley who left money for several Auckland charities.

As the seat of the Iowa General Assembly, the building houses the Iowa Senate, Iowa House of Representatives, the Office of the Governor, and the Offices of the Attorney General, Auditor, Treasurer, and Secretary of State. The building also includes a chamber for the Iowa Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Iowa Supreme Court building. The building was constructed between 1871 and 1886, and is the only five-domed capitol in the country. Located at East 9th Street and Grand Avenue, the Capitol is set atop a hill and offers a panoramic view of the city's downtown and the West Capitol Terrace. Various monuments and memorials are to its sides and front, including the Soldiers and Sailors' Monument and the Lincoln and Tad statue. History =Construction= Not long after achieving statehood, Iowa recognized that the Capitol should be moved farther west than Iowa City, and the 1st General Assembly, in 1846, authorized a commission to select a location. In 1847, the town of Monroe City, in Jasper County, was selected as the new location of the capitol and platted out, but the 1848 Legislature decided not to move the capitol from Iowa City. In 1854, the General Assembly decreed a location ‚Äúwithin two miles of the Raccoon fork of the Des Moines River.‚Äù The exact spot was chosen when Wilson Alexander Scott gave the state nine and one-half acres where the Capitol now stands. Final legislative approval for the construction of a permanent statehouse was given on April 8, 1870.Iowa Official Register, 2007-2008. Old Capitol in Des Moines A three-story brick building served as a temporary Capitol and was in use for 30 years, until destroyed by fires: in the meantime, the permanent Capitol was being planned and built. In 1870, the General Assembly established a Capitol commission including local businessman and politician Peter A. Dey to employ an architect, choose a plan for a building (not to cost more than $1.5 million), and proceed with the work, but only by using funds available without increasing the tax rate. John C. Cochrane and Alfred H. Piquenard were designated as architects, and a cornerstone was laid on November 23, 1871. However, much of the original stone deteriorated through waterlogging and severe weather, and had to be replaced. The cornerstone was relaid on September 29, 1873. Although the building could not be constructed for $1.5 million as planned, the Cochrane and Piquenard design was retained, and modifications were undertaken. Cochrane resigned in 1872, but Piquenard continued until his death in 1876. He was succeeded by two of his assistants, Mifflin E. Bell and W.F. Hackney. Bell redesigned the dome so that it better fit the proportions of the building. with Hackney was the only architect who stayed on the project until the end. The capitol building was dedicated on January 17, 1884, and it was completed sometime in 1886. The building commission made its final report on June 29, 1886, with a total cost of $2,873,294.59. The audit showed that only $3.77 was unaccounted for in the 15 years of construction. =Fire and restoration= On January 4, 1904, a fire was started when the gas lights were being converted into electricity. The fire swept through the areas that housed the Supreme Court and Iowa House of Representatives. A major restoration was performed and documented, with the addition of electrical lighting, elevators, and a telephone system. Little information is available about who performed the actual restoration during these early years. However, Elmer Garnsey created the ceiling artwork in the House Chamber. These earlier efforts to preserve the Capitol mostly dealt with maintaining and upgrading its interior. It was not until 1965, when the dome was regilded, that legislators made significant investments in preserving the building's exterior. By the early 1980s, the exterior of the Capitol had noticeably deteriorated. Sandstone pieces had begun falling from the building, prompting the installation of steel canopies at all entrances of the building to protect pedestrians. Decorative stone, whose deterioration had first been documented as early as the start of the 20th century, had also eroded. Work on the exterior restoration began in the spring of 1983 and was completed in nine phases. Phase 9 work began in the spring of 1998, and the entire project was completed in the fall of 2001, at a cost of $41 million. =International stature= North side view of Capitol building While its primary use is as the house of the legislative branch of Iowa government, the Capitol also functions as a living museum and state and international cultural facility. Since 1987, the World Food Prize laureate award ceremony is held annually in October in the House of Representatives chamber of the statehouse. The ceremony rivals that of the Nobel Prize, drawing over 800 people from more than 75 countries. Each year, world-class performers take the stage to honor the World Food Prize Laureate. Past performers have included Ray Charles, John Denver, and Noa to name a few. Following the ceremony, the celebration continues at a laureate award dinner held in the Capitol rotunda. Architecture The architectural design of the Capitol, rectangular in form, with great windows and high ceilings, follows the traditional pattern of 19th-century planning for public buildings. A modified and refined Renaissance style gives the impression of strength and dignity combined with utility. The building measures from north to south and from east to west. Exterior The central dome. The exterior of the building is entirely of stone with elaborate columns and handsomely designed cornices and capitals. Iowa stone is the foundation for the many porticoes of the building. The building is brick with limestone from Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, and Illinois. The substructure is of dark Iowa stone topped by a heavy course of wari-colored granite cut from glacial boulders gathered from the Iowa prairie. The superstructure, or main part of the building, is of bluff colored sandstone from quarries along the Mississippi River in Missouri. Both front and back porticoes have pediments supported by six Corinthian columns each. The pediment over the front entrance discloses a fine piece of allegorical sculpture. The commanding feature is the central towering dome constructed of iron and brick and covered with tissue- paper thin sheets of pure 23-carat gold. There is a protective layer sealing the gold from the weather. The gold leafing was replaced in 1964‚Äì1965 at a cost of $79,938. The most recent regilding of the dome was carried out from 1998 to 1999, at a cost of about $482,000. The dome is surmounted by a lookout lantern that may be reached by long and winding stairs, and it terminates in a finial that is above the ground floor. From its opening during 1884 until 1924, it was the tallest building in Des Moines, and likely the entire state. The rotunda beneath the dome is in diameter. Four smaller domes of simple design rise from the four corners of the Capitol. Interior The beauty, dignity, and arrangement of the interior become apparent as a visitor stands under the dome of the first floor. Broad, lofty corridors extend west, north, and south. Walls are highly decorated and the rooms and chambers of the capitol have a wide variety of Iowa wood as well as imported marble. Twenty- nine types of imported and domestic marble were used in the interior; and the wood used‚Äîwalnut, cherry, catalpa, butternut, and oak‚Äîwas nearly all from Iowa forests. The marble grand staircase between the second and third floors is to the east and is the focal point of the building. Suites opening from the south corridor are those of the Governor, Auditor of State, and Treasurer of State. The historical Supreme Court Chamber is to the north; the Secretary of State's suite is to the west. The grand staircase ascends to a landing and divides north and south to bring visitors to the floor above, where the House of Representatives is on the north, the Senate is on the south side, and the Law Library on the west. The Victorian-styled Law Library features four stories of balcony shelves surrounding a central atrium and is open to the public on weekdays. The ground floor houses a cafeteria and administrative offices. =Art= Iowa State Capitol dome as viewed inside from rotunda Around the rotunda on the frieze above the columns is the famous quotation from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: \\"This nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\\" Extending the full width of the east wall over the staircase is the great mural painting Westward, an idealized representation of the coming of the people who made Iowa. The painting was completed shortly after the start of the 20th century. Edwin H. Blashfield, the artist, wrote of it: \\"The main idea of the picture is a symbolical presentation of the Pioneers led by the spirits of Civilization and Enlightenment to the conquest by cultivation of the Great West.\\" In the central rotunda, suspended beneath the ceiling on wires is a very large banner of the insignia of the Grand Army of the Republic, which between 1894 and 1953 had a room in the state capitol dedicated for their use. They are the only non-state agency to have ever occupied space in the capitol. =Displays= The battle flags carried by the Iowa regiments in various wars are preserved in niches on the main floor: Civil War, 1; Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, 13; World War I, 26. In the west hall is a plaque done by Nellie V. Walker in commemoration of the work of Iowa women in the fight for political equality and a memorial to those Iowans killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Also in the west hall is a model of the battleship on loan from the U.S. Department of the Navy. The model is 18 feet 7 inches long and weighs about 1,350 pounds. It is a perfect scale model, inch equaling 1 foot. The Iowa was the lead ship of her class of battleship and the fourth in the United States Navy to be named in honor of the 29th state. It is also the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships, and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. On July 7, 2012, the retired Iowa opened to the public as a floating educational and naval museum at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California. In the south hall across from the Governor's office is a collection of porcelain dolls representing the 41 Iowa First Ladies in miniature replicas of their inaugural gowns. Where actual descriptions of the gowns could not be found, they are typical of the period. As future First Ladies take their place, they, too, will be represented.

Musically, the band evolved over their career. Their early sound was characterized by psychedelic elements, such as delayed guitars and noise washes. Their unique sound gained a growing local following (winning several Philly music awards), however, did not increase marketability. Later, Zen Guerrilla fused blues, rock and gospel to create a sound which could be likened to bands such as the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. History Zen Guerrilla formed in Newark, Delaware in the late 80s. Band members Andy Duvall (drums), Marcus Durant (vocals/harmonica), Carl Horne (bass), Daniel McMullen (keyboard) and Rich Millman (guitar) came together from local bands Marcus Hook, The Gollywogs, Stone Groove and No Comment. Their early sound was characterized by psychedelic elements, such as delayed guitars and noise washes played by The Sloth (before leaving the band in 1991). This unique sound gained a growing local following (their first two color-vinyl 45's winning several Philly music awards), while avoiding increased marketability. Later, the band released their self-titled CD on Philadelphia-based Compulsiv Records in 1992 and Recorded at the world-famous Third Story Recording Studio in Walnut Hill with producer/engineer, Scott \\"Turkey Lips\\" Herzog.See the liner notes on their records and CD's Soon after, Zen Guerrilla moved to Philadelphia and were regular performers around the city at clubs such as the Khyber Pass Pub. Around this time the band began a heavy touring schedule, which would have them cross the country multiple times through the end of the decade. Zen Guerrilla relocated to San Francisco in 1994. Their constant touring increased their exposure, and, combined with their explosive live show, helped to release albums first with Alternative Tentacles and later Sub Pop, which is known for being the original record company of Nirvana. The band's version of the song \\"Empty Heart\\" was featured in the 2000 PlayStation game Grind Session. The band dissolved sometime around 2003.

He has been a professor of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara since 1966, and he is currently a member of the external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute. Hartle is known for his work in general relativity, astrophysics, and interpretation of quantum mechanics. Work In collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann and others, Hartle developed an alternative to the standard Copenhagen interpretation, more general and appropriate to quantum cosmology, based on consistent histories. With Dieter Brill in 1964, he discovered the Brill‚ÄìHartle geon, an approximate solution realizing Wheeler's suggestion of a hypothetical phenomenon in which a gravitational wave packet is confined to a compact region of spacetime by the gravitational attraction of its own field energy. With Kip Thorne, Hartle derived from general relativity the laws of motion and precession of black holes and other relativistic bodies, including the influence of the coupling of their multipole moments to the spacetime curvature of nearby objects, as well as writing down the Hartle-Thorne metric, an approximate solution which describes the exterior of a slowly and rigidly rotating, stationary and axially symmetric body. Working at the Enrico Fermi Institute at the University of Chicago in 1983, he developed the Hartle‚ÄìHawking wavefunction of the Universe in collaboration with Stephen Hawking.

This approach attempts to answer open questions of classical physical cosmology, particularly those related to the first phases of the universe. Classical cosmology is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity (GTR or simply GR) which describes the evolution of the universe very well, as long as you do not approach the Big Bang. It is the gravitational singularity and the Planck time where relativity theory fails to provide what must be demanded of a final theory of space and time. Therefore, a theory is needed that integrates relativity theory and quantum theory.Stephen Hawking wrote 1999: So what the singularity theorems are really telling us, is that the universe had a quantum origin, and that we need a theory of quantum cosmology, if we are to predict the present state of the universe.

The name is an abbreviation of the Russian internatzionalny dom or \\"International House\\". It was created in on March 26, 1933 by the textile women of the city under the direction of the Soviet section of International Red Aid (also known as –ú–ûPR, its Russian acronym). The boarding school was later named after founder Elena Dmitrievna Stasova. It was conceived as a school for children of repressed democratic leaders and activists from all over the world. Interdom underwent major extensions in the years 1961, 1969 and especially around 1990. As the Soviet Union collapsed, Interdom also became home for many children victims of the Chernobyl disaster. At the beginning of the 21st century plans to transform the international school into a military academy for cadets (see Suvorov Military School) were successfully blocked. This was achieved thanks to a major effort by the school staff, the Russian Red Cross and the prompt response of the Russian Committee for Peace, in particular the influence of its president, the former chess world champion Anatoly Karpov.

Biography  Omn√®s is currently Professor Emeritus of Theoretical Physics in the Facult√© des sciences at Orsay, at the Universit√© Paris-Sud XI. He has been instrumental in developing the consistent histories and quantum decoherence approaches in quantum mechanics.  Philosophical work  In his philosophical work (especially in Quantum Philosophy), Omn√®s argues that: # Until modern times, intuitive, rational thought was sufficient to describe the world; mathematics remained an adjunct, simply helping to make our intuitive descriptions more precise. # In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, we arrived at a Fracture between common sense and our best descriptions of reality. Our formal description became the truest picture (most consistent with how things are, experimentally) and common sense was left behind. Our best descriptions of reality are now incomprehensible to common sense alone, and our intuitions as to how things are, are often negated by experiment and theory. # However it is, finally, possible to recover common sense from our formal, mathematical description of reality. We can now demonstrate that the laws of classical logic, classical probability and classical dynamics (of common sense, in fact) apply at the macroscopic level, even in a world described by a single, unitary wavefunction. This follows from the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, with no need for extralogical constructs such as wavefunction collapse. We will never, Omn√®s believes, find a common sense interpretation of quantum law itself. Nevertheless, it is now possible to see that common sense and quantum reality are compatible with each other: we can enter the world at either starting point, and we will find that each leads to the other: experiment leads to theory, and the theory can now recover the common sense framework in which the experiment was conducted (and in which our lives are lived).  The new 'Copenhagen Interpretation'?  Omn√®s' work is sometimes described as an updating of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. This is somewhat misleading. The relationship between the two accounts is as follows. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (argued for most centrally by Niels Bohr) tells us to \\"shut up and calculate\\". It says that there are certain questions we simply cannot ask, and that there are inexplicable rules which we have to apply in order to get from a quantum description of reality (which we know is experimentally correct to at least 10 decimal places of accuracy) to the reality of our day-to-day, common sense lives (which seems self-evidently correct, and yet is apparently in contradiction with quantum law). Omn√®s tells us that we no longer have to shut up in order to calculate: there is now a self-consistent framework which enables us to recover the principles of classical common sense - and to know, precisely, their limits - starting from fundamental quantum law.

It was written by Osamu Tezuka as a critique of the Japanese government's approval of recombinant DNA research that year. Synopsis Deep in the South American jungle, a 20-year-old Japanese hunter named Ryosuke (‚ÄúRyo‚Äù for short), and a local boy named Chico, stalk a monster that has been terrorizing the local countryside. Ryosuke, however, is quite familiar with this beast, and the story flashes back to his childhood. 15-year-old Ryosuke Ishigami, the delinquent son of a crime reporter and a geneticist, is out with a motorcycle gang when they encounter a mysterious woman. Some of the rougher members of the gang accost her, and she turns out to be anything but normal, landing the gang with serious injuries. The gang leader returns to the woman's hideout for revenge, but the gang members are torn apart, except for Ryosuke. The woman, named Bagi, turns out to be a \\"cat-woman\\" - a cross between a human and a mountain lion. She recognizes Ryosuke as the boy who had rescued her and raised her as a kitten when he was 6 years old. As Bagi grew and people became suspicious of the precocious \\"cat\\", who was able to walk on her hind legs and even learned to write her own name and speak, she escaped and grew to adulthood on her own and nine years have passed until she met Ryosuke again. Upon their reunion, Ryosuke and Bagi join forces to find out the truth of her origins. Ryosuke's own mother is found responsible for Bagi's creation -- Bagi is a product of recombinant DNA research between human and mountain lion cells. They then follow Ryosuke's mother to South America to confront her about the reason for Bagi's existence, but find a far greater peril. The officials in charge of the laboratories there are creating a strain of rice that has the potential to destroy humanity. Ryosuke's mother sacrifices her life to have Bagi destroy the \\"Rice Ball\\" and Ryosuke mistakenly pins the blame on Bagi, vowing revenge. Meanwhile, Bagi is quickly losing her human traits and becomes extremely feral, attacking any humans that come near. Ryosuke catches up to her and stabs her when she attacks, but then finds a hand-written note held in a locket around her neck. He reads his mother's last words, expressing remorse for being both a bad scientist and a bad mother, and Ryosuke realizes his mistake and is filled with regret. He returns to the site the next morning to find Bagi's body gone, a set of footprints leading off to the distant mountains, meaning that Bagi has survived the stabbing and run off. He prays for Bagi to live on in solitude, far away from mankind. Characters (in order of appearance) ; Ryo / Ryosuke Ishigami : A young Japanese man and the main protagonist. His father is a crime reporter, and his mother, Prof. Ishigami, works in a laboratory without mentioning much about it not coming home often. Believing he doesn't have much to live for, he joins a biker gang. He reunites with Bagi on his 15th birthday and becomes a hunter five years later. Bagi was his \\"pet\\" when she was not yet fully grown. ; Chiko / Chico : A Mexican boy who suspects that Bagi killed his father and seeks revenge. He meets Ryo and helps him track down Bagi in the nearby wilderness. He wears a sombrero and is skilled in the use of bolas. ; Bagi : A creature genetically modified to contain both human and feline DNA (her specific origins are not disclosed in the story). Bagi and her mother were the only survivors of an animal outbreak at the SuperLife Center, though her mother was eventually hunted down. Bagi wandered as a kitten until she met Ryo and became his \\"pet cat\\". As she grew and developed human characteristics and intelligence, she was forced to leave and disguised herself as a human girl, searching for more of her own kind until she meets Ryo again. ; Prof. Yoko Ishigami : Ryo's mother and a leading research professor at the SuperLife Center. She believes that anything can be improved with science. She is responsible for the creation of Bagi and others like her. After the President coerces her to mass-produce poisonous \\"rice balls\\", she is overwhelmed with guilt and arranges to have Bagi destroy the rice balls. She is killed in the process, and Ryo mistakenly blames Bagi. Her last letter to Ryo expresses remorse for being a bad scientist and a bad mother. ; The Chief : The man in charge of the SuperLife Center, who is cunning and ambitious. He has a short, almost comical stature (possibly from dwarfism) with long hair that sticks up in a fashion similar to that of Albert Einstein and a small moustache similar to that of Adolf Hitler. He explains Bagi's origins after she and Ryo infiltrate the Center, then is hypnotized into arranging transport for them to South America to meet with Professor Ishigami. ; Colonel Sado : The head of the Imperial Guards of Monica. He mistakes Ryo and a driver for rebels after Ryo and Bagi hijack a circus truck. After making Bagi perform a jump through a thirty-meter flaming coil (under threat of execution), he knocks Bagi and Ryo out and takes them to the Cucaracha Research Lab without their knowledge. He's seen again with the President as he and Professor Ishigami discuss the change in the genetically-engineered rice before they found out it had a strong poison in it. When Ryo tried to escape, Sado attempted to start a sword fight with him. This leads to doing so on a pair of bikes. Sado meets his possible end when he falls off the tower of the Research Lab. It is also possible that he may have survived. ; The President of Monica : The malevolent president of the North American country where the Cucaracha Research Lab is located, he is rather heavyset and dresses in gaudy attire, including a robe that appears to be made from dyed animal tails. He comes to inspect the work being done at the Research Lab, and then gets the idea to use a poisonous genetically-engineered rice created there to eliminate guerrilla rebels that have been opposing his government for years, as well as anyone else who opposes him. When Prof. Ishigami refuses to cooperate with his plan, he has her killed by his attack dogs. His plans are ultimately defeated thanks to Bagi and Ryo, Bagi escaping the lab with the only samples of the rice while Ryo destroyed the lab. ; Cemen Bond : The man responsible for keeping Ryo in custody at the Cucaracha Research Lab, known for his remarkable marksmanship. His decisions solely depend on coin flipping. Following Ryo's escape from the Research Lab, he is fired and then agrees to teach the boy everything he knows about shooting. He appears to be a loose parody of James Bond, evidenced by his last name and music that plays during most of his appearances. Distribution elsewhere Currently, the anime has not received official distribution in North America in any form at all, save a subtitled version available for viewing on YouTube and on Viki.com. However, it has been released in other countries, but as of 2020, an official English dub has not yet been produced. A crowdfunder for a North American DVD was attempted at Anime Sols, but was not successful.

In the European Parliament, he sat with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. He became involved in politics in the mid-1990s, and announced on 29 December 2007 that he would run for president in the 2008 Cypriot presidential elections. He gained 0.77% of the national vote, coming fourth behind the three main candidates. Early life Matsakis was born in Limassol. He graduated from the University of London in 1976 with a BSc in microbiology and was awarded a PhD in biochemistry in 1981. He gained his medical degree from the University of Cambridge in 1984, and specialised in forensic medicine at the University of Glasgow, where he was awarded an MPhil in 1992. He then moved to Greece, where he continued his studies in forensic pathology. He returned to Cyprus in 1994. He initially assumed a position in the medical field, but soon became interested in politics and was elected as an MP in 1996. Controversy =Smuggling claims= On 30 October 2005, the Cyprus Mail reported that Matsiakis' home in Pyrga had been raided twice during the week by police and CID officials, accusing him of smuggling antiquities. The newspaper said that he had \\"enough chests, amphoras and other artefacts for three antique stores\\". The first raid took place on 23 October 2005. Matsiakis can be prosecuted under Cypriot law, as the European Parliament lifted his immunity earlier in the month. He will also be charged with attempts to blackmail a drug squad officer in an unrelated case. Police officials found more than 110 chests and hundreds of Grecian urns on his property. Matsakis protested his innocence, stating, \\"It looks like some people do not want my voice to be heard in Cyprus or Europe.\\" The Cyprus Mail reported on 22 August 2007 that all cases against Matsakis had collapsed and that he had been cleared. He called for an independent inquiry to examine possible police corruption, and to identify suspected political motives for the initiation of the whole affair, which started only three days after he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament. After two years, authorities returned 250 items that were confiscated from his home. The Attorney General of Cyprus, after studying the case, decided that no charge could be brought against Matsakis and all items seized from his home were to be returned to him. =Racism and homophobia= In 2008, Matsakis asked not to be sent \\"offensive\\" emails by fellow MEPs. The emails were invitations to the European Parliament's \\"Different Families, Same Love\\" exhibition, which showcased LGBT and mixed race families. He also complained to the president of the European Parliament about posters for the exhibition being stuck up near his office. LGBT activists in Cyprus pointed out Matsakis' hypocrisy regarding his stance against \\"non-normal\\" families, as his family situation included a child out of wedlock despite his Greek Orthodox beliefs. While participating on the talk show Tolmo in 2012, Matsakis claimed that \\"homosexuality is not normal\\" yet asserted that there is no homophobia in Cyprus, despite several studies by the EU and other organisations concluding that Cyprus is one of the most homophobic nations in Europe.

On the strength of his work in Tormentor, he was invited to perform vocals on the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album by Norwegian black metal band Mayhem after Dead committed suicide. His groundbreaking new ways of singing added a special character to Mayhems sound. Ultimately Csihar performed no live concerts with the band until his second tenure in 2004. Void ov Voices live in Malm√∂, 2011 Hole In The Sky 2011 After Mayhem, Csihar continued to work in various bands, such as Plasma Pool, Aborym, and Korog; he also performed as Caiaphas in the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar in Hungary.

They can be contrasted with \\"free-sites\\", which do not charge a membership fee.Williams, p. 57 Most paysites offer \\"free tours\\" which allow non-members to view a limited number of short trailers.Williams, p. 69 The vast majority of paysite memberships are bought by men.Williams, p. 77 Some of the earliest paysites began by scanning images from pornographic magazines.Williams, p. 100 The number of sites then grew until the market was saturated, and now many thousands of sites cater to every legal pornographic niche. Because there is free porn available on the Internet (e.g. in the form of thumbnail gallery post (TGP) and streaming video sites, as well as piracy), and some individuals cannot afford to or do not wish to purchase paysite memberships or to give their personal and credit card information to such sites, some consumers of pornography view only free pornography. However, paysites are often one of the main originators of new content; they are one way an administrator can pay for the bandwidth costs and they are one of the most conspicuous ways in the industry to try to turn a profit. Theoretically, the more revenue a site takes in, the higher quality content it can produce. Payment methods include credit card or checking account billing. Bills routinely appear on statements as transactions under the name of a billing entity with a neutral-sounding company name (ostensibly for discretionary reasons) and may not be readily recognized as paysite billing transactions upon casual perusal of bank statements. Most paysites prevent unauthorized access to their members area by means of a username and password. A problem that paysites have is copyright protection, even with well-secured sites: there are cases of so-called \\"site rips\\", i.e. sites are either hacked, or subscribers redistributed content from a members' area without authorization; there have thus been sightings of original content on other TGP sites or entire site rip archives on file sharing networks. Some sites sell site rips of paysites.Porn piracy wars get personal Administrators may try to counter these problems by employing digital rights management technologies. Because members must confirm some details of their identity when they make their payment, a touted advantage of paysites is the potential to keep minors from viewing their content, which, in several jurisdictions, including the United States, is illegal. The issue of how to protect these Internet audiences from pornographic material deemed harmful to them has been widely debated in the U.S. in light of the 1998 federal Child Online Protection Act, although websites hosted in the United States are required by law to publish contact information for the custodian of records. Many paysites attract potential paying customers by providing a portion of their content for free via free hosted galleries (FHGs),Williams, p. 59 and use an affiliate program to drive new traffic to those FHGs.Williams, p. 65 The percentage of unique visitors to FHGs who become paying members is known as the conversion ratio. With so many paysites and so much free porn being readily available the pricing of many paysites has dropped in recent years to increase subscriptions. This has seen the rise of discount sites that offer reduced price memberships to a variety of paysites. Paysites have also increased the quality of their content to attract memberships, with many now offering 4K videos to their members.

He is best known for his book on Beethoven's string quartets, which was the most widely read and quoted book on the subject prior to Joseph Kerman's 1966 book The Beethoven Quartets. In addition to his work on Beethoven, he published numerous essays on other composers. Some of his book on Beethoven was a translation and paraphrase of the 1885 book in German by Theodor Helm. Marliave was a close friend of Gabriel Faur√©, who wrote the preface to the original French edition of the book on the Beethoven quartets. Marliave was also a captain in the French army, and he was killed in action in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the World War I. Maurice Ravel memorialized him in his Le tombeau de Couperin, dedicating the closing Toccata to him (the sixth part of the piano version, but absent in the orchestral arrangement).

They are spoken in the 'Old Bavarian' regions of Upper Bavaria (with Munich), Lower Bavaria and in the adjacent parts of the Upper Palatinate region around Regensburg, in Upper and Lower Austria, in Vienna (see Viennese German), in the state of Salzburg, as well as in the northern and eastern parts of Styria and Burgenland. Differences There are noticeable differences in the language within the group, but changes occur along a west-east dialect continuum on both sides of the historic border of the Bavarian stem duchy with the later Duchy of Austria. That means that the distinct languages of Vienna and Munich are very different from each other, but the dialects of any two neighbouring towns in between will be quite similar. However, due to influences of the corresponding political centres, discontinuous change is nowadays noticeable along the national border between Austria and Germany. Generally, Viennese has some characteristics differentiating it from other Bavarian dialects due to the influence of languages spoken by people moving to Vienna from many areas of Austria-Hungary during the 19th century. Characteristics A characteristic of Central Bavarian is the vocalization of l and r after e or i. E.g. the standard German viel becomes either vui (in Western Central Bavarian) or v√º√º (in Eastern Central Bavarian). The border between the western and eastern subgroups roughly coincides with the border between Bavaria and Austria. In all subgroups, hard consonants such as p, t, k are softened to become b, d, g.

Retrieved 17 September 2016 (22 November 1877 ‚Äì 30 July 1930), known in Catalonia as Joan Gamper (), was a Swiss football pioneer, versatile athlete and club president. He founded football clubs in Switzerland and Spain, most notably FC Barcelona and FC Z√ºrich.  Early years  Hans-Max Gamper (his mother's maiden name ‚Äì Haessig ‚Äì is generally appended in Spanish sources) was born in Winterthur, Switzerland. He was the eldest son and third of five children born to August Gamper and Rosine Emma Haessig. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was eight and the family moved to Z√ºrich. He became a citizen of the city and in his later youth started to learn his craft as a tradesman in an apprenticeship at the silk trade house Grieder at the centrally located Paradeplatz. As a youngster, Gamper was a keen cyclist and runner. Throughout his life he was a lover of all sports and, apart from football, he also played rugby union, tennis and golf. In Switzerland, he was highly regarded as a footballer. His first football club was Excelsior Z√ºrich which was playing in the same colours (red and blue) as later FC Barcelona. After some members of Excelsior split off to form FC Turicum Z√ºrich, they reunited with Excelsior in 1896 to form FC Z√ºrich. Gamper was a co-founder and the first captain of the club's history. In the early years of football in Switzerland, it was allowed to play for an indefinite number of teams from other cities as a guest player in friendly games ‚Äì Gamper is known to have played among others two games for FC Winterthur and FC Basel. Hans Gamper representing FC Z√ºrich (founded as a polideportivo) was in 1898 holder of the Swiss records over the 800m and 1600m track distances.Leichtathletik: Beim FCZ seit 1896 He also organised the first international athletics competition in Z√ºrich during autumn of the same year. Today, this event is one of the most renowned international athletics events worldwide, the Weltklasse Z√ºrich (organised by FC Z√ºrich spin-off LC Z√ºrich). In 1897, work took him temporarily to Lyon in France, where he played rugby for Athletique Union. The other names they called him, all came from the difficulty the Catalan people had, pronouncing the German \\"H\\" and \\"G\\": Hans became Kans, Gamper became Kamper. But he is most known as Johannes, becoming Joan Gamper.  Founding FC Barcelona  In 1899, he went to Barcelona to visit his uncle, Emili Gaissert, who was living there. He was on his way to Africa to help set up some sugar trading companies but fell in love with the Catalan city and decided to stay put. He would later become a fluent Catalan speaker and adopt the Catalan version of his name, Joan Gamper. As an accountant, he found work with Cr√©dit Lyonnais, the Sarri√† Railway Company and as a sports columnist, he worked for two Swiss newspapers. He joined the local Swiss Evangelical Church and began playing football within the local Christian Protestant community in the district of Sarri√†-Sant Gervasi. He also attended the Gimnasio Sol√© and helped publish a magazine, Los Deportes. The ad in Los Deportes. On 22 October 1899 Gamper placed an advert in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club. A positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Sol√© on 29 November and Football Club Barcelona was born. The founders included a collection of Swiss, British and Spanish enthusiasts. It is not known, if Gamper chose the legendary club colours, blaugrana, after FC Basel or FC Excelsior Z√ºrich. However, the other Swiss teams Gamper played for, and Merchant Taylors' School in Crosby, Merseyside have all been credited and/or claimed to be the inspiration. Although Gamper was the driving force behind the club, initially he chose only to be a board member and club captain. He was still only 22 and wanted to concentrate on playing the game he loved. He played 48 games for FC Barcelona between 1899 and 1903, scoring over 100 goals. His teammates included Arthur Witty. In 1900‚Äì01 he was a member of the FC Barcelona team that won the club's first trophy, the Copa Macaya. This competition is now recognised as the first Catalan championship. In 1902 he played in the very first Copa del Rey final. Barca lost 2‚Äì1 to Club Vizcaya.  Club President and death  In 1908 Joan Gamper became president of FC Barcelona for the first time. Gamper took over the presidency as the club was on the verge of folding. Several of the club's better players had retired and had not been replaced. This soon began to affect the club's performances both on and off the field. The club had not won anything since the Campionat de Catalunya of 1905 and its finances suffered as a result. He was subsequently club president on five separate occasions (1908‚Äì09, 1910‚Äì13, 1917‚Äì19, 1921‚Äì23 and 1924‚Äì25) and spent 25 years at the helm. One of his main achievements was to help Bar√ßa acquire their own stadium. Until 1909 the team played at various grounds, none of them owned by the club. Gamper raised funds from local businesses and on 14 March 1909, they moved into the Carrer Ind√∫stria, a stadium with a capacity of 6,000. He also launched a campaign to recruit more club members and by 1922 the club had over 10,000. This led to the club moving again, this time to Les Corts. This stadium had an initial capacity of 20,000, later expanded to an impressive 60,000. Gamper also recruited the legendary player Paulino Alc√°ntara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917 appointed Jack Greenwell as manager. This saw the club's fortunes begin to improve on the field. During the Gamper era FC Barcelona won eleven Championat de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Coupe de Pyren√©es and enjoyed its first golden age. As well as Alc√°ntara the Bar√ßa team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, F√©lix Ses√∫maga and Franz Platko. His final presidency ended in controversial circumstances and personal tragedy. On 24 June 1925, FC Barcelona fans jeered the Spanish national anthem and then applauded God Save the King performed by a visiting British Royal Marine band. The dictatorship of Primo de Rivera accused Gamper of promoting Catalan nationalism. Les Corts was closed for six months. Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and money problems and was laid to rest on the Cemetery of Montju√Øc. The funeral of Joan Gamper was attended by many people in the city.  Legacy  In 1966 the FC Barcelona president, Enric Llaudet, created the Joan Gamper Trophy in his honour. This is a pre-season tournament featuring international teams as guests and is traditionally used by the club to unveil the team for the forthcoming season. The club also permanently retired his club membership number and the city named a street, Carrer de Joan Gamper in Les Corts district, after him. In 2016 also in Zurich a small street in a central location of the city already named \\"Gamperstrasse\\" has been dedicated to him. In 2002 FC Barcelona marked the 125th anniversary of his birth. In 2004 the Winterthur Group, a Swiss insurance company with offices in Barcelona since 1910, became sponsors of the FC Barcelona basketball team, which led to the team featuring the birthplace of Gamper on their shirts and in their name Winterthur FCB until 2007, after Winterthur Group was purchased by AXA. Perhaps this and the fact that the club developed into a polideportivo, the very personification of Gamper, is the most fitting tribute to this all-round sportsman. Today Barcelona is \\"more than just a football club\\". It promotes amateur track and field sports and has rugby union and cycling teams. All of these were sports played by Gamper. Bar√ßa also has professional basketball, handball and roller hockey teams as well as amateur indoor football, women's football, volleyball, baseball and field hockey teams. Over the years they have even had an ice hockey team.

St. Louis School (), located in Sai Ying Pun (historically West Point, Hong Kong) is a privately run, Catholic primary and (government-subsidized) secondary English grammar school. There are currently about 800 secondary students and 350 primary school students. History =Early history= During the 1840s, the present location of St. Louis School was the site of a small battery, called the West Point Battery or Elliot's Battery. St. Louis School was founded in 1864 by the Fathers of the Catholic Mission; St Aloysius was chosen as the Patron of the school.Antiquities and Monuments Office. Central and Western Heritage Trail. St. Louis School The school was initially known as the West Point Reformatory. The Brothers of the Christian Schools (commonly known as the La Salle Brothers) succeeded the Fathers in the management of the school in 1875 and managed the school until 1893. In 1921, Bishop Pozzoni, the Ordinary of Hong Kong, requested the Maryknoll Fathers to take over. Some of the boys were orphans while the rest were remanded by the Hong Kong government, the government giving a small monthly grant for each student. The Maryknoll Fathers renamed the school 'St Louis Industrial School' and equipped it with a printing press. The students became expert in this line and seven years later when the Paris Foreign Missions Society started their celebrated polyglot press at Nazareth in Pokfulam, they took into their employ many of these boys. When Brother Albert Staubli arrived, he added manual training to its curriculum in the way of carpentry. The American Maryknoller, Fr James Edward Walsh, who was one of the first four American missioners to arrive in China and the last Western missioner to be released by the Communist China in 1970, spent some time at the school too. Early in 1926, Maryknoll's Father Superior and one of the co-founders, Fr James Anthony Walsh, made a visitation of his fledgling mission fields in South China and spent some weeks in Hong Kong before visiting Kongmoon (now called Jiangmen) and Kaying (in Meixian). In the course of his stay, the position of the industrial school was reviewed and it was eventually handed back to the Diocese. =Salesian Fathers= In 1927 the school was given to the Salesian Fathers and has been run by them since then.Antiquities Advisory Board.

The school was transformed from a vocational school to an English grammar school in 1948. The primary section of St Louis School was particularly famous in the 1970s and the 1980s, for it won almost all the inter-school quiz competitions organized by Radio Television Hong Kong. Facilities The school consists of four wings: East, North, Central and West. The oldest one is the East Wing (Block A), which was built in 1936. The North Wing was damaged by a typhoon in 1936, and a new building was subsequently erected. The Central and West Wings were constructed and opened in 1951 and 1969 respectively. The school's sports facilities include a football playground (with a stand for about 1,300 people), a basketball court and a covered playground. The football playground is the largest among those of all the schools in West Point.

It could not run from the rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries available at the time, but a hardware modification was available that made this possible. The computer's only available form of mass storage was the port for a cassette audiotape recorder, which was notoriously finicky and unreliable.

A Disk/Video Interface expansion box was released in 1984, with one single-sided double- density 180KB 5-1/4 inch disk drive and a CRT video adapter. This allowed the Model 100 to display 40 or 80 column video on an external television set or video monitor. One empty drive bay permitted the installation of a second disk drive (which proved handy for backing up disks). Another popular form of data backup was that of file transfer to a desktop computer, via either the modem connected to a telephone line, or the RS-232 serial port connected to a null modem cable. The built-in TELCOM firmware made this a convenient option. Not coincidentally, the TRS-80 Model 4's TRSDOS 6 operating system included a utility called TAPE100 that used the Model 4's cassette port to read and write tapes created by a Model 100, the data of which were stored in TRSDOS disk files. Also because TRSDOS 6 included a communications application (COMM/CMD), the Model 100 proved a popular \\"peripheral\\" for the Model 4 customer. A bar code reader wand was also offered.  ROM firmware  When first switched on, the Model 100 displays a menu of applications and files and the date and time. The ROM firmware-based system boots instantly, and the program that was running when the unit was powered off is ready to use immediately on power-up. Cursor keys are used to navigate the menu and select one of the internal or added application programs, or any data file to be worked upon. The 32 kilobyte read-only memory of the Model 100 contains the N82 version of the Microsoft BASIC 80 programming language. This is similar to other Microsoft BASICs of the time and includes good support for the hardware features of the machine: pixel addressing of the display, support for the internal modem and serial port, monophonic sound, access to tape and RAM files, support for the real-time clock and the bar code reader, and I/O redirection between the machine's various logical devices. Like previous Microsoft BASIC interpreters, variable names were restricted to two characters and all program lines and subroutines were numbered and not named. However, the default for floating point numbers is double-precision. This was reportedly the last application software with code written by Bill Gates. The ROM also contains a terminal program, TELCOM; an address/phone book organizer, ADDRSS; a to-do list organizer, SCHEDL; and a simple text editor, TEXT. The TELCOM program allows automation of a login sequence to a remote system under control of the BASIC interpreter. As with other home computers of the era, a vast collection of PEEK and POKE locations were collected by avid hobbyists. The Model 100 TEXT editor was noticeably slow in execution, especially for fast touch typists. This was due partly to the slow 8085 CPU and due partly to the slow response time of the LCD screen. Often after speed-typing a sentence or two, the user would have to wait several seconds for the computer to \\"catch up\\". As a small compensation, many users found it somewhat amusing watching the text appearing on the display, particularly text inserted into the body of a paragraph. A perhaps not well-known but documented feature of TEXT was that it partially supported the WordStar command interface. The supported commands were the cursor movement and character deletion key combinations on the left hand side of the keyboard; the commands for activating Wordstar menus, like the Block menu, were not functional. Invisible files in the system RAM named \\"Hayashi\\" and \\"Suzuki\\" commemorate the names of designers Junji Hayashi and Jay Suzuki. Another invisible deleted file named \\"RickY\\" refers to Rick Yamashita. Title and author obtained via Google translation from the original Japanese. The Model 100 firmware was the last Microsoft product that Bill Gates developed personally, along with Suzuki. According to Gates, \\"part of my nostalgia about this machine is this was the last machine where I wrote a very high percentage of the code in the product\\". Added applications and data files are stored in the internal battery-backed RAM; these can be loaded from and stored to an audio cassette tape recorder or external floppy disk drive. Optional ROMs can be installed in the Model 100, providing a range of customized application software. Only one optional ROM can be installed at a time. Some commercial software applications for the Model 100 were also distributed on cassette. The Model 100 ROM has a Y2K bug; the century displayed on the main menu was hard- coded as \\"19XX\\". Workarounds exist for this problem. Since the century of the date is not important for any of the software functions, and the real-time clock hardware in the Model 100 does not have a calendar and requires the day of the week to be set independently of the date, the flaw does not at all impair the usability of the computer; it is cosmetic.  Applications  When introduced, the portability and simplicity of the Model 100 made it attractive to journalists,Bruce Garrison Computer-assisted reporting, Routledge, 1998 , page 192 who could type about 11 pages of text and then transmit it for electronic editing and production using the built-in modem and TELCOM program. The keyboard is full-size and uses a standard (QWERTY) layout; reviewers praised it but reported that it was noisy. To quiet the computer, owners put orthodontic rubber bands under the keys. The computer is otherwise silent when it operates, except for the speaker, and runs for 20 hours on 4 readily available and easily replaceable AA batteries. Data is protected by a built-in rechargeable (Ni-Cd) battery when the AA batteries discharge or are removed for replacement. There are several simple programs available on the Internet for transferring files between a Model 100 and a modern personal computer (or a vintage one). The Model 100 was also used for industrial applications and in science laboratories as a programming terminal for configuration of control systems and instruments. Its compactness (ease of handling and small space requirements), low maintenance needs, lack of air vents (a plus for dusty or dirty environments), full complement of ports, and easy portability made it very well suited for these applications. Third-party peripherals for the Model 100 extended its battery life and file storage capacity. Software was designed, and is still available, to extend the display capabilities (to 60 columns and 10 rows of text using smaller characters) and to provide more advanced word-processing or calculation software than the supplied programs. To this day, hobbyists continue to design games, applications, and hardware for this device. Simple drawing programs and games using the pixel-addressable display were favorites among users. As with virtually all other contemporary home computers, users are able to create their own applications using the included BASIC programming language. There are no built-in facilities for 8085 assembler programming, but the thoroughly-documented BASIC interpreter by Microsoft offered the clever coder tricks for accessing machine code subroutines. These tricks usually involved packing the raw object code into strings or integer arrays, and would be familiar to veteran programmers for the older TRS-80 Models I and III.  Peers and successors  The Tandy 200 was introduced in 1984 as a more capable sister product of the Model 100. The Tandy 200 has a flip-up 16 line by 40 column display and came with 24 KB RAM which can be expanded to 72 KB (3 banks of 24 KB). Rather than the \\"button\\" style keys of the Model 100, its four arrow keys are a cluster of keys of the same size and shape as those comprising the keyboard, though the function and command \\"keys\\" are still of the button type. The Tandy 200 includes Multiplan, a spreadsheet application. It also added DTMF tone dialing for the internal modem, whereas the Model 100 only supports pulse dialing. On a phone line that doesn't support pulse dialing, users may dial manually using a touch-tone phone and then put the Model 100 online. The last new model that could be considered part of this line was the Tandy 600, introduced in October 1985. Similar to the Tandy 200, it features a flip-up screen, but with 80 columns rather than 40. Built-in features include a 3.5\\" diskette drive, rechargeable batteries, and 32K of RAM expandable to 224K. The underlying software platform was Microsoft's 16-bit Hand Held Operating System (Handheld DOS or HHDOS), along with word processing, calendar, database, communication and spreadsheet software. Unlike earlier models, BASIC was an extra-cost option rather than built in. The last refresh to the product line was the Tandy 102, introduced in 1986 as a direct replacement for the Model 100, having the same software, keyboard, and screen, and a nearly identical, but thinner, form factor that weighed about one pound less than the Model 100. This reduction in size and weight was made possible by the substitution of surface-mount chip packaging. Standard memory for the 102, 24K RAM, was upgradable to 32K with an ordinary 8K SRAM chip. Later portables from Tandy no longer featured a ROM-based software environment, starting with the Tandy 1400LT, which ran a diskette- based MS-DOS operating system. = Similar computers from other companies = The NEC PC-8201 computer As mentioned previously, the Olivetti M-10 and the NEC PC-8201 and PC-8300 were also built on the same platform as the original Kyocera design. The earlier and smaller Epson HX-20 of 1983 used a much smaller LCD display, four lines of twenty characters, and had an internal cassette tape drive for program and file storage. There were several other \\"calculator-style\\" computers available at the time, including the Casio FP-200, the Texas Instruments CC-40, and the Canon X-07.14 notebook computers in brief: Creative Computing Vol 10 No 1, January 1984 Systems of about the same size and form-factor as the Model 100, aimed at journalists, were sold by companies such as Teleram, as the Teleram T-3000The Portable Companion, June/July 1982 and GRiD Systems, as the GRiD Compass, which was used by NASA. GRiD was later acquired by Tandy. The Bondwell 2 of 1985 was a CP/M laptop in a similar form factor to the Model 200. Data General developed the Data General-One (DG-1), a much more powerful (but more costly) MS-DOS portable computer with disk drives and a full-sized LCD screen, similar to the Tandy LT1400. It was released in 1984. The Zenith ZP-150, also of 1984, was introduced prior to the Tandy 600. The two computers were notably similar, although the ZP-150 did include BASIC and could be configured with more memory, but did not have a built-in diskette drive. Computers from two other British companies were similar in form and functionality to the Model 100. The Cambridge Z88 of 1987, developed by British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, had greater expansion capacity due to its built-in cartridge slots. It had a far more sophisticated operating system called OZ that could run multiple applications in a task-switched environment. The firmware contained a powerful application called Pipedream that was a spreadsheet that could also serve capably as a word processor and database. The other British computers were the Amstrad NC100 and NC200, produced from 1992. Many modern laptop computers are larger and heavier than the Model 100. However, practically none of them run 20 hours on batteries without a battery change. The electronic word processing keyboards AlphaSmart Dana and the Quickpad Pro bear some resemblance to the physical format of the TRS-80 Model 100. In Japan Pomera still makes and sells dedicated word processors under model names Pomera DM100, Pomera DM200 etc. The Laser 50 educational computer is in the same size and form factor as the Model 100, and was sold by Video Technology. Reception Tandy stated that the Model 100's sales \\"have only been moderate\\", and an InfoWorld columnist later claimed that \\"it was only journalists\\" who had been buying it. The system's popularity with journalists, however, probably helped Radio Shack improve the company's poor reputation with the press and in the industry. The magazine's reviewer called the computer \\"remarkable\\", praising its power relative to size and price and noting that he wrote the review \\"at the lofty height of 37,500 feet aboard a United DC-10\\". He concluded, \\"I'm not used to giving Radio Shack kudos, but the Model 100 is a brave, imaginative, useful addition to the realm of microcomputerdom\\" and \\"a leading contender for InfoWorlds Hardware Product of the Year for 1983\\", an award which it indeed won. BYTE described the Model 100 as \\"an amazing machine\\". While noting the lack of mass storage, the reviewer praised \\"one of the nicest keyboards I've used on any machine, large or small\\" and the \\"equally impressive\\" built-in software, and concluded \\"the designers of this machine ... should be congratulated\\". The magazine later stated that \\"Tandy practically invented the laptop computer\\". PC Magazine criticized the Model 100 display's viewing angle, but noted that the text editor automatically reflowed paragraphs unlike WordStar. It concluded that the computer \\"is an ingenious, capable device ... an exciting example of the new wave of portable computers\\". Creative Computing said that the Model 100 was \\"the clear winner\\" in the category of notebook portables under $1000 for 1984, although cautioning that \\"the 8K version is practically useless\\".

It incorporates some method of predicting what the NCAA Selection Committee will use as its Ratings Percentage Index in order to determine at-large (non- conference winning) teams to complete the field of 64 teams, and, to seed the field by ranking all teams from first through sixty-eighth. Bracketology also encompasses the process of predicting the winners of each of the brackets. In recent years the concept of bracketology has been applied to areas other than basketball.Sorting It All Out... with Brackets : NPRThe Tournament of Books at The Morning News Background Joe Lunardi is credited with inventing the term bracketology. Lunardi had been editor and owner of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook, a preseason guide roughly 400 pages long. In 1995, Blue Ribbon added an 80-page postseason supplement which was released the night the brackets were announced. So that the release could be timely, Lunardi began predicting the selection committee's bracket. On February 25, 1996, The Philadelphia Inquirer referred to Lunardi as a bracketologist, which is the first known instance the term was applied to a college basketball expert. While Lunardi did not recall using the term before its use in the article, Inquirer writer Mike Jensen credits its origins to Lunardi. Lunardi soon started the website Bracketology.net, and ESPN began running his predictions in exchange for a link to his website. By 2002, Lunardi had his own Bracketology page with ESPN. He also teaches an online course at Saint Joseph's University titled \\"Fundamentals of Bracketology\\".Bracketology  Saint Joseph's University Predicting participants Using the NCAA basketball tournament selection process, the RPI, and the seeding and balancing process, a \\"bracketologist\\" places teams in the tournament in the various regions (most commonly East, West, Midwest, and South however sometimes the region names are changed to reflect the host cities). Some bracketologists go as far as placing teams in which \\"pods\\" they will play in the first and second rounds.Columns - CBSSports.com Generally, the lists also show the last four teams in and the first four teams out. However, these brackets change daily as conference tournaments continue and teams automatically qualify for the tournament. A bracketologist's credibility is judged on how many teams he predicts correctly being in the tournament and the average difference between the bracketologist's projected seed and the actual seed assigned by the NCAA Selection Committee. The difference between projected matchups and the differences between the \\"pods\\" selected in the first and second rounds are less important. Predicting winners Various methods are used to predict the winners in a bracket. While some use math and statistics, others make selections based on team mascots or colors. President Barack Obama became famous for his bracket predictions. After entering office, he presented his projected winners annually on ESPN in a segment called Barack-etology. However, in 2015 he was bested by his former political rival, Mitt Romney, who ranked in the top 0.1 percent of entrants in ESPN's 2015 Tournament Challenge, correctly predicting six \\"Elite Eight\\" teams, each \\"Final Four\\" team, and the championship game matchup, while also correctly predicting Duke would win the title. Non-basketball applications Bracketology as a discipline has spread beyond a focus on basketball, into other sports, as well as pop culture, history, nature, and other topics where a loose application of binary opposition may be profitable for study or enjoyment, albeit without the label of \\"bracketology\\" itself. This spread has been helped along by literary agent and writer Mark Reiter and sports journalist Richard Sandomir, who have edited two books on bracketology as applied to the world around them, most recently The Final Four of Everything,The Final Four of Everything  Book by Mark Reiter, Richard Sandomir - Simon & Schuster which was published by Simon & Schuster in May 2009.

The term \\"redskin\\" underwent pejoration through the 19th to early 20th centuries and in contemporary dictionaries of American English it is labeled \\"usually offensive\\", \\"disparaging\\", \\"insulting\\", or \\"taboo\\". The origin of the choice of \\"red\\" to describe Native Americans in English is debated. While related terms were used in anthropological literature as early as the 17th century, labels based on skin-color entered everyday speech around the middle of the 18th century. \\"At the start of the eighteenth century, Indians and Europeans rarely mentioned the color of each other's skins. By midcentury, remarks about skin color and the categorization of peoples by simple color-coded labels (red, white, black) had become commonplace.\\" Although the term has almost disappeared from common use, it remains as the name of many sports teams. Most prominent was the National Football League team in Washington, D.C. After decades of resistance to change by the owner, management and fans; major sponsors responded to calls to end systemic racism in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by advocating a name change. In July 2020 the name \\"Washington Redskins\\" was retired, with a new name to be selected later. Red as a racial identifier Documents from the colonial period indicate that the use of \\"red\\" as an identifier by Native Americans for themselves emerged in the context of Indian-European diplomacy in the southeastern region of North America, before later being adopted by Europeans and becoming a generic label for all Native Americans. Linguistic evidence indicates that, while some tribes may have used red to refer to themselves during the Pre-Columbian era based upon their origin stories, the general use of the term was in response to meeting people who called themselves \\"white\\" and their slaves \\"black\\". The choice of red rather than other colors may have been due to cultural associations, rather than skin color. Red and white were a dichotomy that had pervasive symbolic meanings in southeastern Native cultures which was less prevalent among northern tribes. While there was occasional use of \\"red\\" in Indian-European diplomacy in the northeast, it was still rare there even after it had become common in the southeast. Instead, \\"Indian\\" was translated into the native languages there as \\"men\\", \\"real people\\", or \\"original people\\". Usage in the northeast region by Europeans may have been largely limited to descriptions of tribes such as the Beothuk of Newfoundland, whose practice of painting their bodies and possessions with red ochre led Europeans to refer to them as \\"Red Indians\\". Early ethnographic writers used a variety of terms; olivastre (olive) by Fran√ßois Bernier (1684),Anonymous [F. Bernier], \\"Nouvelle division de la terre par les diff√©rentes esp√®ces ou races qui l'habitent\\", Journal des S√ßavants, 24 April 1684, p. 133-140. rufus (reddish, ruddy) by Linnaeus (1758)Linnaeus, Syst. Nat. ed. 10 Vol. 1. p. 21. kupferroth (\\"copper-red\\") by Blumenbach (1779),Blumenbach, J. F. 1779. Handbuch der Naturgeschichte vol. 1, pp. 63f and eventually simply \\"red\\" by Ren√© Lesson (1847).Charles Hamilton Smith, Samuel Kneeland, The Natural History of the Human Species (1851), p. 47, listing \\"Red Race\\" as one of the six races identified by Ren√© Lesson, Description de mammif√®res et d'oiseaux r√©cemment d√©couverts; pr√©c√©d√©e d'un Tableau sur les races humaines (1847), i.e. White (Caucasian), Dusky (Indian), Orange-colored (Malay), Yellow (Mongoloid), Red (Carib and American) and Black (Negroid). Early explorers and later Anglo-Americans termed Native Americans \\"light-skinned\\", \\"brown\\", \\"tawny\\", or \\"russet\\", but not \\"red\\" prior to the 19th century; In the modern debate over sports teams with the name, it is sometimes asserted that Oklahoma translates from Choctaw as \\"red people\\" (okla, people + humma, red). However, \\"humma\\" has a number of possible meanings in Choctaw, one of which is \\"humma, an addition to a man's name which gives him some distinction, calling on him for courage and honor.\\" The alternative meaning of Oklahoma becomes \\"honorable/courageous nation\\" or \\"a brave people\\". Origins of redskin in English Use of the English adjective \\"red\\" in reference to American Indians as a race is first recorded in the 1720s. The combination with \\"skin\\", to form the term \\"redskin\\", can be dated to 1769. It arises from a translation of French peaux rouges, which in turn had been written by the French translator from the Miami-Illinois language, in a letter sent by three chiefs of the Piankashaws to Col. John Wilkins. The term here refers to warriors specifically. The term \\"redskin\\" enters wider English usage only in the first half of the 19th century. Ives Goddard (2005) pointed out that what had previously been considered the earliest attestation of the term, a letter purported to have been written to an Englishman living in Hadley, Massachusetts in 1699, was spurious. The letter supposedly contains both \\"ye Red Skin Men\\" and \\"ye Red Skins\\". Based on this source, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) had suggested that the term was specifically applied to the Delaware Indians and \\"referred not to the natural skin color of the Delaware, but to their use of vermilion face paint and body paint\\". Goddard pointed out that OED had mis-dated the source, the letter was in fact a piece of historical fiction written in 1900.The OED agreed with Goddard's findings, stating that the quotation was \\"subsequently found to be misattributed; the actual text was written in 1900 by an author claiming, for purposes of historical fiction, to be quoting an earlier letter\\". =Roots in Native American language= Goddard's alternative etymology is that the term emerged from the speech of Native Americans themselves, and that the origin and use of the term in the late 18th and early 19th century was benign when it first appeared \\"it came in the most respectful context and at the highest level. ... These are white people and Indians talking together, with the white people trying to ingratiate themselves\\". The word later underwent a process of pejoration, by which it gained a negative connotation. Goddard suggests that \\"redskin\\" emerged from French translations of Native American speech in Illinois and Missouri territories in the 18th century. He cites as the earliest example a 1769 set of \\"talks\\", or letters, from chiefs of the Piankeshaw to an English officer at Fort de Chartres. One letter included \\"si quelques peaux Rouges\\", which was translated as \\"if any redskins\\", and the second included \\"tout les peaux rouges\\", which was translated as \\"all the redskins\\". However, in an interview Goddard admitted that it is impossible to verify whether the native words were accurately translated. The term appeared in an August 22, 1812, meeting between President James Madison and a delegation of chiefs from western tribes. There, the response of Osage chief \\"No Ears\\" (Osage: Tetobasi) to Madison's speech included the statement, \\"I know the manners of the whites and the red skins,\\" while French Crow, principal chief of the Wahpekute band of Santee Sioux, was recorded as having said, \\"I am a red-skin, but what I say is the truth, and notwithstanding I came a long way I am content, but wish to return from here.\\" The earliest known appearance of the term in print occurred in 1813, in an article in the Weekly Register quoting a letter dated August 27, 1813. It concerned an expedition during the War of 1812 led by General Benjamin Howard against Indians in the Illinois and Mississippi territories: \\"The expedition will be 40 days out, and there is no doubt but we shall have to contend with powerful hordes of red skins ...\\" However, while these usages may have been earlier, they may not have been disseminated widely. (For instance, while the 1812 meeting with President Madison was contemporaneously recorded, the records were not published until 2004. Goddard suggests that a key usage was in a 20 July 1815 speech by Meskwaki chief Black Thunder at the treaty council at Portage des Sioux, in which he is recorded as stating, \\"My Father ‚Äì Restrain your feelings, and hear ca[l]mly what I shall say. I shall tell it to you plainly, I shall not speak with fear and trembling. I feel no fear. I have no cause to fear. I have never injured you, and innocence can feel no fear. I turn to all, red skins and white skins, and challenge an accusation against me.\\" This speech was published widely, and Goddard speculates that it reached James Fenimore Cooper. In Cooper's novels The Pioneers (published in 1823) and The Last of the Mohicans (1826), both Native American and white characters use the term. These novels were widely distributed, and can be credited with bringing the term to \\"universal notice\\". The first time the term appears in Bartlett's \\"Dictionary of Americanisms\\" (in 1858), Goddard notes, the illustrative reference is to Last of the Mohicans. Johnathan Buffalo, historic preservation director of the Meskwaki, said that in the 1800s \\"redskins\\" was used by the tribe for self-identification. Similarly, they identified others as \\"whiteskins\\" or \\"blackskins\\". Goddard's evidence for Native language usage includes a 1914 phonetic transcription of the Meskwaki language in which both eesaawinameshkaata 'one with brown skin' and meeshkwinameshkaata 'one with red skin' were used to refer to Indians, while waapeshkinameshkaanichini 'one with white skin, white person' was used to refer to Europeans. However, the pre- contact Meskwaki use of \\"red\\" in identifying themselves did not refer to skin color, but to their origin stories as the \\"red-earth\\" people. Historian Darren Reid of Coventry University states it is difficult for historians to document anything with certainty since Native Americans, as a non-literate society, did not produce the written sources upon which historians rely. Instead, what is cited as Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Any use of \\"red\\" in its various forms, including redskin, by Native Americans to refer to themselves reflected their need to use the language of the times in order to be understood by Europeans. Sociologist James V. Fenelon makes a more explicit statement that Goddard's article is poor scholarship, given that the conclusion of the origin and usage by Natives as \\"entirely benign\\" is divorced from the socio-historical realities of hostility and racism from which it emerged. =Pejoration= \\"Pawnee the Redskin Giant\\", 1906 photograph The pejoration of the term \\"redskin\\" arguably begins as soon as its introduction in the early 19th century. A linguistic analysis of 42 books published between 1875 and 1930 found that negative contexts for the use of \\"redskin\\" were significantly more frequent than positive ones. However, the use of the word \\"Indian\\" in a similarly selected set of books was nearly the same, with more frequent negative than positive contexts, indicating that it was not the term \\"redskin\\" that was loaded pejoratively, but that its usage represents a generally negative attitude towards its referent. The word was first listed in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 1898 as \\"often contemptuous.\\" Sociologist Irving Lewis Allen suggests that slang identifiers for ethnic groups based upon physical characteristics, including \\"redskin\\", are by nature derogatory, emphasizing the difference between the speaker and the target. However, Luvell Anderson of the University of Memphis, in his paper \\"Slurring Words\\", argues that for a word to be a slur, the word must communicate ideas beyond identifying a target group, and that slurs are offensive because the additional data contained in those words differentiates those individuals from otherwise accepted groups. In the same sense that \\"nigger\\" originated as meaning nothing more than \\"black-skinned\\", redskin also took on an increasingly negative meaning. Some Native American activists in the 21st century, in contradiction of the etymological evidence discussed above, assert that \\"redskin\\" refers directly to the bloody, red scalp or other body part collected for bounty. \\"Hunting redskins for the time being became a popular sport in New England...\\" While this claim is associated in the media with litigants in the Washington Redskins trademark dispute; Amanda Blackhorse and Suzan Shown Harjo, the NCAI's support indicates that the belief is widespread. Goddard (2005) denies any direct connection to scalping, and says there is a lack of evidence for the claim. King (2016) argues that the lack of direct evidence for the assertion does not mean that those making the claim are \\"wrong to draw an association between a term that empathizes an identity based upon skin color and a history that commodified Native American body parts\\". The term \\"red-skin\\" was, in fact used in conjunction with scalp hunting in the 19th century. In 1863 a Winona, Minnesota, newspaper, the Daily Republican, printed an announcement: \\"The state reward for dead Indians has been increased to $200 for every red-skin sent to Purgatory. This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the Red River are worth.\\" A news story published by the Atchison Daily Champion in Atchison, Kansas, on October 9, 1885, tells of the settlers' \\"hunt for redskins, with a view of obtaining their scalps\\", worth $250. In his early career as the owner of a newspaper in South Dakota, L. Frank Baum wrote an editorial upon the death of Chief Sitting Bull in which he advocates the annihilation of all remaining Redskins in order to secure the safety of white settlers, and because \\"better that they die than live the miserable wretches that they are.\\" The Redskin Duel, 1914 silent film. The Native American roles were played by Native and Japanese actors. When Hollywood westerns were most popular, roughly 1920‚Äì1970, the term \\"redskins\\" was often used to refer to Native Americans when war was imminent or in progress. In the Washington Redskins trademark dispute, the main issue was the meaning of the term in the period when the trademark registrations were issued, 1967‚Äì1990. The linguistic expert for the petitioner, Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, successfully argued that whatever its origins, \\"redskins\\" was a slur at that time based upon passages from books and newspapers and movie clips, in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. John McWhorter, an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University, had compared the evolution of the name into a slur to that of other racial terms such as \\"Oriental\\" which also acquired implied meanings associated with contempt. Current use The Redskin Theater in Anadarko, Oklahoma. The town proclaims itself to be the \\"Indian Capital of the Nation\\", and its population is 41% Native American. In the United States, \\"redskin\\" is regarded as a racial epithet by some,\\"Slang epithet ... Redskin is regarded as highly offensive\\" to Native Americans but as neutral by others, including some Native Americans. The American Heritage style guide advises that \\"the term redskin evokes an even more objectionable stereotype\\" than the use of red as a racial adjective by outsiders, while others urge writers to use the term only in a historical context. In modern dictionaries of American English it is labeled \\"usually offensive\\", \\"disparaging\\", \\"insulting\\", or \\"taboo\\". =Use among Native Americans= Three predominantly Native American schools use the name for their athletic teams, two of which serve reservations: Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos, Arizona where the student body is 99% Native American. and Wellpinit High School, Wellpinit, Washington. The principal of Red Mesa said in 2014 that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate \\"the legacy of negativity that the term has created.\\" In 2014, Wellpinit High School, located on the Spokane Indian Reservation, voted to keep the Redskins name. Native American writer and attorney Gyasi Ross compares Native American use of variations of the word \\"Redskin\\" with African-American use of variations of the word \\"Nigger\\". Use of these terms by some members of minority communities does not mean that these words may be used by outsiders. Ross also notes that while activism on the issue may be from a minority of Native Americans, this is due to most being concerned with more immediate issues, but also says \\"The presentation of the name 'Redskins' is problematic for many Native Americans because it identifies Natives in a way that the vast majority of Natives simply don't identity ourselves.\\" =Sports teams= Numerous civil rights, educational, athletic, and academic organizations consider any use of native names/symbols by non- native sports teams to be a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping which should be eliminated. Washington Redskins The controversy regarding Native mascots in general, and use of the name Redskins, had been most prominent in the name used by the Washington National Football League team from 1933 to 2020. Public protest of the name began in 1968, with a resolution by the National Congress of American Indians. Native American groups and their supporters argue that since they view the word \\"redskin\\" as offensive, it is inappropriate for an NFL team to continue to use it, regardless of whether any offense is intended. After decades of opposition to the name of the team by Native Americans, major sponsors responded to opponents of systemic racism in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. FedEx, Nike, and PepsiCo advocated changing the name. On July 3, 2020, Washington owner Daniel Snyder and team management announced a process of review of the name. On July 13, 2020 the team made an official statement that their review would result in the retirement of the Redskins name and logo. On July 23, the team temporarily changed its name to the \\"Washington Football Team\\" until a more permanent name can be revealed at a later date. =Opinion polls= The results and conclusions of public opinion polls with regard to the use of Native American mascots have been criticized by scholars and Native American leaders. While polls indicate that a large majority of Native American individuals are not offended by the term \\"Redskins\\", a 2020 study at UC Berkeley which found that 49% of self-identified Native Americans responded that the Washington Redskins name was offensive or very offensive, while only 38% were not bothered by it. In addition, for study participants who were heavily engaged in their native or tribal cultures, 67% said they were offended, for young people 60%, and those with tribal affiliations 52%. These results are similar to that found in a study by the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University, San Bernardino. A survey of 400 individuals, with 98 individuals positively identified as Native Americans, found that 67% agreed with the statement that \\"Redskins\\" is offensive and racist. The response from non- natives was almost the opposite, with 68% responding that the name is not offensive. In a 2004 poll by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, 90% of those who identified themselves as American Indians answered that they were \\"not bothered\\" by the name \\"Redskins\\" being used for the Washington football team. However, in a commentary published soon after that poll, fifteen Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. In August 2015, a memo prepared by Annenberg's Managing Director of Survey Research made it clear that the survey should not be taken as an accurate reflection of Native American attitudes at the time, since the methods used to survey the general population are not effective for generating representative samples for Native Americans, a population having unique characteristics (e.g., multiple languages, unusual residential patterns) that require specialized survey designs if they are to be measured rigorously. In May 2016, The Washington Post asked the same question from the Annenberg survey in its general opinion poll when a respondent identified themselves as Native American, producing the same results, that 90% of the 504 respondents were \\"not bothered\\" by the team's name. While taking steps to address some of the issues in the 2004 survey, many of the conditions remained the same, and the results were immediately criticized for similar reasons. =Trademark case= On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) cancelled the six trademarks held by the team in a two-to-one decision that held that the term \\"redskins\\" is disparaging to a \\"substantial composite of Native Americans\\", and this is demonstrated \\"by the near complete drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s\\". Evidence of disparagement submitted by the petitioners in the TTAB case include the frequent references to \\"scalping\\" made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game, and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using \\"redskin\\" to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy. A linguistics expert for the team unsuccessfully argued that the name is merely a descriptive term no different than other uses of color to differentiate people by race. The linguistic expert for the petitioners, Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg, argued that whatever its origins, \\"redskins\\" was a slur at the time of the trademark registrations, based upon the passages from books and newspapers and movie clips, in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt, derision, condescension, or sentimental paeans to the noble savage. Although the USPTO decision was upheld upon appeal, on June 19, 2017 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in another case, Matal v. Tam, that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violated the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department withdrew from any further litigation, the legal issue being moot. College and secondary school teams College teams that formerly used the name changed voluntarily: * The University of Utah Redskins became the Utah Utes in 1972. * The Miami University (of Ohio) Redskins became the RedHawks in 1997. * The Southern Nazarene University Redskins became the Crimson Storm in 1998. The number of high schools using the Redskins name‚Äî45‚Äîhas been in steady decline. In a survey conducted in 2013, 40% had local efforts to change the name, with 28 high schools in 18 states had done so. By December 2017, the number of high school \\"Redskins\\" had continued to decline from 62 to 49, including four affected by a 2015 California law. In 2019 Teton High School in Idaho and in March 2020 Paw Paw High School in Michigan retired the name. In July, 2020 Anderson High School in Ohio and Clinton Community Schools in Michigan quickly voted to change their mascots after the decision by the Washington Football Team.

The habit of some plants to move in the direction of the sun, a form of tropism, was already known by the Ancient Greeks. They named one of those plants after that property Heliotropium, meaning sun turn. The Greeks assumed it to be a passive effect, presumably the loss of fluid on the illuminated side, that did not need further study. Aristotle's logic that plants are passive and immobile organisms prevailed. In the 19th century, however, botanists discovered that growth processes in the plant were involved, and conducted increasingly ingenious experiments. A. P. de Candolle called this phenomenon in any plant heliotropism (1832). It was renamed phototropism in 1892, because it is a response to light rather than to the sun, and because the phototropism of algae in lab studies at that time strongly depended on the brightness (positive phototropic for weak light, and negative phototropic for bright light, like sunlight). A botanist studying this subject in the lab, at the cellular and subcellular level, or using artificial light, is more likely to employ the more abstract word phototropism, a term which includes artificial light as well as natural sunlight. The French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan was one of the first to study heliotropism when he experimented with the Mimosa pudica plant. The phenomenon was studied by Charles Darwin and published in his penultimate book The Power of Movement in Plants in 1880, a work which included other stimuli to plant movement such as gravity, moisture and touch. Floral heliotropism Daisies (Bellis perennis) facing the sun after opening in the morning Heliotropic flowers track the sun's motion across the sky from east to west. Daisies or Bellis perennis close their petals at night but open in the morning light and then follow the sun as the day progresses. During the night, the flowers may assume a random orientation, while at dawn they turn again toward the east where the sun rises. The motion is performed by motor cells in a flexible segment just below the flower, called a pulvinus. The motor cells are specialized in pumping potassium ions into nearby tissues, changing their turgor pressure. The segment flexes because the motor cells at the shadow side elongate due to a turgor rise. This is considered to be turgor-mediated heliotropism. For plant organs that lack pulvini, heliotropism can occur through irreversible cell expansion producing particular growth patterns. This form of heliotropism is considered to be growth-mediated. Heliotropism is a response to light from the sun. =Explanations= Several hypotheses have been proposed for the occurrence of heliotropism in flowers: * The pollinator attraction hypothesis holds that the warmth associated with full insolation of the flower is a direct reward for pollinators. * The growth promotion hypothesis assumes that effective absorption of solar energy and the consequent rise in temperature has a favourable effect on pollen germination, growth of the pollen tube and seed production. * The cooling hypothesis, appropriate to flowers in hot climates, assumes that the position of flowers is adjusted to avoid overheating. In general, flower heliotropism could increase reproductive success by increasing pollination, fertilization success, and/or seed development, especially in the spring flowers. Some solar tracking plants are not purely heliotropic: in those plants the change of orientation is an innate circadian motion triggered by light, which continues for one or more periods if the light cycle is interrupted. Tropical convolvulaceous flowers show a preferred orientation, pointing in the general direction of the sun but not exactly tracking the sun. They demonstrated no diurnal heliotropism but strong seasonal heliotropism. If solar tracking is exact, the sun‚Äôs rays would always enter the corolla tube and warm the gynoecium, a process which could be dangerous in a tropical climate. However, by adopting a certain angle away from the solar angle, this is prevented. The trumpet shape of these flowers thus acts as a parasol shading the gynoecium at times of maximum solar radiation, and not allowing the rays to impinge on the gynoecium. Sunflowers in full bloom are not heliotropic, so they do not follow the Sun. The flowerheads face east all day, so in the afternoon, they are backlit by the Sun. In the case of sunflowers, a common misconception is that sunflower heads track the Sun across the sky throughout the whole life cycle. The uniform alignment of the flowers does result from heliotropism in an earlier development stage, the bud stage, before the appearance of flower heads. The apical bud of the plant will track the sun during the day from east to west, and then will quickly move west to east overnight as a result of the plant's circadian clock. The buds are heliotropic until the end of the bud stage, and finally face east. Phototropic bending can be catalyzed in the hypocotyls of juvenile sunflower seedlings while heliotropic bending in the shoot apex does not start occurring until the later developmental stages of the plant, showing a difference between these two processes. The flower of the sunflower preserves the final orientation of the bud, thus keeping the mature flower facing east. Leaf heliotropism Leaf heliotropism is the solar tracking behavior of plant leaves. Some plant species have leaves that orient themselves perpendicularly to the sun's rays in the morning (diaheliotropism), and others have those that orient themselves parallel to these rays at midday (paraheliotropism). Floral heliotropism is not necessarily exhibited by the same plants that exhibit leaf heliotropism.

He was one of the first faith healers in the United States with a touring tent ministry after World War II. Coe was ordained in the Assemblies of God in 1944, and began to preach while still serving in World War II. In the following twelve years, he traveled the U.S. organizing tent revivals to spread his message. Coe was frequently the center of controversy, preached extensively through the South, and employed some 80 persons.\\" Early life Jack Coe was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the seventh child of George Henry and Blanche Zoe (Mays) Coe of Pleasantville, Venango County, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma City. His parents later placed him in an orphanage. He left there in 1935 at the age of 17. A heavy drinker, he joined the Army after World War II began. He later claimed to have experienced a miracle during his time in the military that caused him to become a Christian minister. Coe had close ties with the Assemblies of God, and preached several meetings while he was in the Army. He was ordained in 1944, and began his career as an itinerant preacher.Harrell 1975, p. 58 Tent evangelist and ministries Coe was dynamic and enthusiastic in his beliefs. He knew Oral Roberts and was impressed by the size of Roberts' revival tent. One day Coe went to a Roberts' tent meeting and measured the tent; he then ordered a larger one.Harrell 1975, p. 59 Coe was not bashful about announcing that his tent was the largest in the world; bigger, he claimed, than the one Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus used.Harrell 1975, p. 60 Coe was co- editor of fellow evangelist Gordon Lindsay's Voice of Healing magazine until 1950, when he began his own magazine, the Herald of Healing. By 1956 its circulation was approximately 250,000. Coe also opened a children's orphanageHarrell 1975, p. 175 and built a large church building known as the Dallas Revival Center.Harrell 1975, p. 61 Conflict with denomination and controversy Coe‚Äôs revival messages centered upon healing, and he was adamant about not taking medicines and not visiting doctors.Harrell 1975, p. 62 In 1953, the Assemblies of God expelled him on the grounds that he was \\"misleading the public\\" and \\"antagonizing Dallas Civil Authorities\\". He was also accused of having an extravagant lifestyle and home. Upon hearing that, Coe printed pictures of four large homes owned by some top officials in the Assemblies of God and the smaller homes of himself and three other revivalists. Coe also charged that the Assemblies of God were \\"fighting divine healing\\". Other revivalists soon came into conflict with Pentecostal denominations as well.Harrell 1975, p. 111‚Äì112 Coe's arrest and case dismissed Coe taught and preached fervently on divine healing, claiming to have healed visitors to his revivals. In a 1955 revival service in Miami, Florida, Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he had healed their son of polio. Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's leg braces. However, the boy was not cured, and removing the braces left him in constant pain. As a result, Coe was arrested and on February 6, 1956 and was charged with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A judge dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law.  Death In November, a few months after the charges were dismissed, Coe became sick while in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He returned to Texas and underwent a tracheotomy to help his breathing after his muscles became paralyzed. He was diagnosed with bulbar polio, and died a few weeks later at Dallas' Parkland Hospital on December 16, 1956. He was 38. After his death, A. A. Allen bought his tent and continued to hold large tent meetings.Robbins 2010, p.85 The Dallas Revival Center was later led by W. V. Grant.Harrell 1975, p. 172 Coe's wife, Rev. Juanita Geneva Scott of Lancaster, Texas, died on September 27, 1996, and was buried in Laurel Land Memorial Park in Dallas. Jack Coe's son, Jack Coe, Jr., also became a preacher with a healing ministry.

Over time, his cartoons have become an iconic feature of the magazine. In a doodler's style, they usually feature an older everyman, -woman, or couple beset by modern complexity, perplexing each other, and interacting with cats and dogs (frequently large numbers of them). Biography Born in Cainsville, Missouri, Booth was the son of schoolteachers; his mother, Irma, was also a musician and fine artist and cartoonist, and his father, William, became a school administrator in Fairfax, Missouri, where Booth grew up on a vegetable farm. Booth attended but did not graduate from the Corcoran College of Art and Design, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, the School of Visual Arts, and Adelphi College. Drafted into the United States Marine Corps in 1944, Booth was invited to re-enlist and join the Corps' Leatherneck magazine as a staff cartoonist; when re-drafted for the Korean War, he was ordered back to Leatherneck. As a civilian, Booth moved to New York City where he struggled as an artist, married, then worked as an art director in the magazine world. He also worked on the comic strip Spot in 1956. Fed up, Booth quit and pursued cartooning full-time, beginning successful in 1969, with the sale of his first New Yorker cartoon. One signature element of Booth's generally messy or run- down interiors is a ceiling light bulb on a cord pulled by another cord attached to an electrical appliance such as a toaster. Most of the household features in his cartoons were drawn from his own home.

Its six points symbolize transportation, labor, commerce, finance, populousness, and salubrity (health). * Added in 1933: This star represents the Century of Progress Exposition (1933‚Äì34). Its points refer to: Chicago's status as the United States' second largest city at the time of the stars addition (Chicago became third largest in a 1990 census when passed by Los Angeles); Chicago's Latin motto, ' (\\"City in a garden\\"); Chicago's \\"I Will\\" motto; the Great Central Marketplace; Wonder City; and Convention City. Additional stars have been proposed, with varying degrees of seriousness. The following reasons have been suggested for possible additions of a fifth star: Flag of Chicago (2015) City of Chicago Flag, with the Star Spangled Banner and Illinois State Flag at its sides at Navy Pier * A fifth star could represent Chicago's contribution to the nuclear age (see Metallurgical Laboratory), an idea first suggested in a 1940s letter published by the Chicago Tribune and later championed by Mayor Daley in the 1960s. * In the 1980s, a star was proposed in honor of Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor of Chicago. * The 1992 Chicago Flood was suggested as an additional natural disaster deserving of a star, in line with the existing star for the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. Another fifth star was in the works from a group of Chicago real estate professionals to represent Chicago's entrepreneurial spirit in the early 1990s. * When Chicago was bidding to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, the Bid Committee proposed that a fifth star be added to the flag in commemoration, but the bid was won instead by Rio de Janeiro. * Anne Burke, Tim Shriver, and others have proposed adding a fifth star to commemorate the Special Olympics, which were founded in Chicago. * Other sports-related suggestions include recognizing the Chicago Bulls' dominance of the NBA in the 1990s and a proposal for a fifth star if the Chicago Cubs should ever win the World Series, which did not happen between their long drought of series wins in 1908, up to 2016. * The Chicago History Museum has an ongoing exhibition where the public is encouraged to vote for a potential fifth star.https://www.chicagohistory.org/exhibition/the-fifth-star-challenge * Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot suggested that Chicago's response to the COVID-19 pandemic could warrant adding a fifth star to Chicago's flag.https://news.wttw.com/2020/05/08/lightfoot-outlines-5-phase-plan-reopen- chicago Unlawful private use Per the Municipal Code of Chicago, it's unlawful to use the flag, or any imitation or design thereof, except for the usual and customary purposes of decoration or display. Causing to be displayed on the flag any letter, word, legend, or device not provided for in the Code is also prohibited. Violators are subject to fines between $5.00 and $25.00 for each offense. History In 1915, Mayor William Hale Thompson appointed a municipal flag commission, chaired by Alderman James A. Kearnes. Among the commission members were wealthy industrialist Charles Deering and impressionist painter Lawton S. Parker. Parker asked lecturer and poet Wallace Rice to develop the rules for an open public competition for the best flag design. Over a thousand entries were received. The 318th Cavalry Regiment (United States) incorporated the flag into their insignia. File:Sketches tribuneoct11892.jpgSketches for the flag from a contest from 1892.

It is attached to the side of a rocket. Unlike solid rocket boosters, LRBs can be throttled down, and can be shut down safely in an emergency for additional escape options in human spaceflight. History By 1926, US scientist Robert Goddard had constructed and successfully tested the first rocket using liquid fuel at Auburn, Massachusetts. Launch of Ariane 44LP two solid rocket booster (smaller) and two liquid rocket boosters (larger, with no visible plumes) For the Cold War era R-7 Semyorka missile, which later evolved into the Soyuz rocket, this concept was chosen because it allowed all of its many rocket engines to be ignited and checked for function while on the launch pad. The Soviet Energia rocket of the 1980s used four Zenit liquid fueled boosters to loft both the Buran and the experimental Polyus space battlestation in two separate launches. Two versions of the Japanese H-IIA space rocket would have used one or two LRBs to be able to carry extra cargo to higher geostationary orbits, but it was replaced by the H-IIB. The Ariane 4 space launch vehicle could use two or four LRBs, the 42L, 44L, and 44LP configurations. As an example of the payload increase that boosters provide, the basic Ariane 40 model without boosters could launch around 2,175 kilograms into Geostationary transfer orbit, astronautix.com while the 44L configuration could launch 4,790 kg to the same orbit with four liquid boosters added. astronautix.com. Various LRBs were considered early in the Space shuttle development program and after the Challenger accident, but the Shuttle continued flying its Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster until retirement. After the Space Shuttle retired, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne and Dynetics entered the \\"advanced booster competition\\" for NASA's next human rated vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS), with a booster design known as \\"Pyrios\\", which would use two more advanced F-1B booster engines derived from the Rocketdyne F-1 LOX/RP-1 engine that powered the first stage of the Saturn V vehicle in the Apollo program. In 2012, it was determined that if the dual-engined Pyrios booster was selected for the SLS Block 2, the payload could be 150 metric tons (t) to Low Earth Orbit, 20 t more than the congressional minimum requirement of 130 t to LEO for SLS Block 2. In 2013, it was reported that in comparison to the F-1 engine, the F-1B engine was to have improved efficiency, be more cost effective and have fewer engine parts. Each F-1B was to produce of thrust at sea level, an increase over the of thrust of the initial F-1 engine. Many Chinese launch vehicles have been using liquid boosters. These include China's man-rated Long March 2F which uses four liquid rocket boosters each powered by a single YF-20B hypergolic rocket engine. The retired Long March 2E variant also used similar four liquid boosters. as did Long March 3B and Long March 3C variants. China developed semi-cryogenic boosters for the Long March 7 and Long March 5, its newest series of launch vehicles as of 2017 . Current usage The Delta IV Heavy consists of a central Common Booster Core (CBC), with two additional CBCs as LRBs instead of the GEM-60 solid rocket motors used by the Delta IV Medium+ versions. At lift off, all three cores operate at full thrust, and 44 seconds later the center core throttles down to 55% to conserve fuel until booster separation. The Angara A5V and Falcon Heavy are conceptually similar to Delta IV Heavy. The Falcon Heavy was originally designed with a unique \\"propellant crossfeed\\" capability, whereby the center core engines would be supplied with fuel and oxidizer from the two side cores until their separation. Operating all engines at full thrust from launch, with fuel supplied mainly from the side boosters, would deplete the side boosters sooner, allowing their earlier separation to reduce the mass being accelerated. This would leave most of the center core propellant available after booster separation. Musk stated in 2016 that crossfeed would not be implemented. Instead, the center booster throttles down shortly after liftoff to conserve fuel, and resumes full thrust after the side boosters have separated.

One of the black basses, it is native to subtropical waters in Florida and Georgia. It is also occasionally found in rivers and streams of East Alabama where it has been declared an endangered species and cannot legally be kept if caught by fishermen. Of typical size for a black bass, M. cataractae reaches a maximum recorded length of and a maximum published weight of 8 pounds, 12 ounces. Only described for the first time in 1999, ichthyologists are still expanding what is known about the species. The shoal bass is often confused with the redeye bass, due to its red-tinted eyes. It is also often confused with the smallmouth bass, due to its faint vertical stripes along the side of its body. Description This species was formerly considered either a redeye bass or subspecies of the redeye bass. In 1999 it was described as a new species. The red color of eyes associates this species with the redeye and Suwannee bass at first glance. However, it is more closely related morphologically to the spotted bass. Shoal bass are generally olive green to nearly black along the back. A dusky dark blotch about 50 to 67 percent of the size of the eye occurs on the back edge of the gill cover. Three diagonal black lines radiate along the side of the head looking like war paint. Ten to fifteen vertical blotches appear along the sides with tiger-stripes often appearing in between. The belly is creamy or white and wavy lines may appear slightly above the white belly on the sides. The dorsal, caudal and anal fins are dark olive green to grayish black. Pelvic fins may have a cream colored leading edge with dark spots. The shoal bass has scales on the base portion of the soft-rayed dorsal fins, clearly connected first and second dorsal fins, and an upper jaw bone that does not extend beyond the eyes. There are no known subspecies of the shoal bass. Range and habitat The shoal bass is becoming increasingly uncommon in the Apalachicola and Chipola Rivers because so few shoals exist and competition with non-native spotted bass has increased. It is also known in the Chattahoochee river drainage; and is most plentiful in the relatively undammed Flint River of Georgia, as well as lakes such as Blackshear and West Point. Shoal bass are closely associated with rock shoals and are uncommon in other habitat due to its unique spawning requirements. The conservation status of shoal bass is vulnerable throughout its range. Good fishing still exists in Georgia's Flint River, but anglers are encouraged to catch and release. Conversely, anglers are urged to keep all spotted bass caught on the Flint River because of its competition with and potential for hybridizing with the shoal bass. Behavior Shoal bass spawn in coarse gravel at the heads of creek pools in April and May, to early June. They prefer a spawning temperature of . Like the largemouth, the male prepares the nest and guards the eggs and fry. Shoal bass feed mainly on aquatic insects on the surface. They also feed on larval insects, crayfish and fish. Shoal bass grow much faster than redeye bass. Sporting quality Shoal bass caught on ultralight tackle Shoal bass offer similar sporting quality to that of other species of black bass. They can be caught using worms, minnows, or crayfish as well as small spinners and a wide variety of small surface lures. Some have been known to reach more than eight pounds. As a sport fish, specific bag and size limit regulations apply, and you can register a qualifying catch as part of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's \\"Big Catch\\" program. The shoal bass has white, flaky meat, which tends to be drier than that of a largemouth or spotted bass. The world record shoal bass was 8 pounds, 12 ounces according to the International Game Fish Association. The fish was caught October 23, 1977, in the Apalachicola River, Florida. This bass was a shoal bass, but originally reported as the Apalachicola form of redeye bass. Shoal bass are also popular targets for fly fishers, who find them easy to access in their preferred river environments. The practice of fly fishing for shoal bass is becoming more widespread. The shoal bass fights harder than its cousin, the largemouth bass, and has more stamina. They prefer moderate to heavy current and will take crawdad patterns aggressively. Five pound shoal bass are considered trophies, but fish above seven pounds are caught each year.

The Codex Mendoza is an Aztec codex, believed to have been created around the year 1541. It contains a history of both the Aztec rulers and their conquests as well as a description of the daily life of pre-conquest Aztec society. The codex is written in the Nahuatl language utilizing traditional Aztec pictograms with a translation and explanation of the text provided in Spanish. It is named after Don Antonio de Mendoza, the viceroy of New Spain, and a leading patron of native artists. Mendoza knew that the ravages of the conquest had destroyed multiple native artifacts, and that the craft traditions that generated them had been effaced. When the Spanish crown ordered Mendoza to provide evidence of the Aztec political and tribute system, he invited skilled artists and scribes who were being schooled at the Franciscan college in Tlatelolco, to gather in a workshop where they could recreate, under the supervision of Spanish priests, the document for himself and the King of Spain. The beautiful and revealing pictorial document that they produced became known as the Codex Mendoza: It consists of seventy- one folios made of Spanish paper measuring 20.6 √ó 30.6 centimeters (8.25 √ó 12.25 inches). The document is crafted in the native style, and today it is bound at the spine in the manner of European books. The codex is also known as the Codex Mendocino and La colecci√≥n Mendoza, and has been held at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University since 1659. It was removed from public exhibition on 23 December 2011. The Bodleian Library holds four other Mesoamerican codices: Codex Bodley, Codex Laud, Codex Selden and the Selden Roll. History The Codex Mendoza on display at the Bodleian Library The manuscript must date from after 6 July 1529, since Hern√°n Cort√©s is referred to on folio 15r as 'marques del Valle'. It must have been produced before 1553, when it was in the possession of the French cosmographer Andr√© Thevet, who wrote his name on folios 1r, 2r, 70v, 71v. The final page of the manuscript explains some of the circumstances in which it was produced. The manuscript was therefore finished in haste and designed to be sent to Spain. More precise information regarding the exact date of the manuscript and the reasons it was produced is controversial. The testimony of the conquistador Jer√≥nimo L√≥pez, probably dating from 1547, may be relevant. Silvio Zavala argued this the book referred to was the Codex Mendoza, and his arguments were restated by Federico G√≥mez de Orozco. If this is the case, then the Codex was written circa 1541 ('six years ago more or less' from L√≥pez's recollection) and was commissioned by Mendoza. As H. B. Nicolson has pointed out, however, the description is not an exact fit for the Codex, and the identification is not certain. According to a later account by Samuel Purchas, a later owner of the Codex, writing in 1625, the Spanish fleet was attacked by French privateers, and the codex, along with the rest of the booty, taken to France. It was certainly in the possession of Andr√© Th√©vet, cosmographer to King Henry II of France. Th√©vet wrote his name in five places on the codex, twice with the date 1553. It was later owned by the Englishman Richard Hakluyt. According again to Samuel Purchase, Hakluyt bought the Codex for 20 French francs. Some time after 1616 it was passed to Samuel Purchase, then to his son, and then to John Selden. The codex was deposited into the Bodleian Library at Oxford University in 1659, five years after Selden's death, where it remained in obscurity until 1831, when it was rediscovered by Viscount Kingsborough and brought to the attention of scholars. Content Written on European paper, it contains 71 pages, divided into three sections: *Section I, folios 1r to 17r or 18r, is a history of the Aztec people from 1325 through 1521 ‚Äî from the founding of Tenochtitlan through the Spanish conquest. It lists the reign of each ruler and the towns conquered by them. It is uncertain whether folios 17v and 18r belong to Section I or Section II. *Section II, folios 17v or 18v to 54v, provides a list of the towns conquered by the Triple Alliance and the tributes paid by each. This section is closely related to, and probably copied from, the Matr√≠cula de Tributos, but the Codex Mendoza contains five provinces not included in the Matr√≠cula.

It is restricted to creeks and rivers (including the Guadalupe River, hence the name Guadalupe bass), and is listed as near threatened. Today, most fly fishermen and anglers practice catch-and-release techniques to improve fish populations. The Guadalupe bass is often difficult to distinguish from the smallmouth bass or spotted bass, and the fish is known to hybridize.  Description and range  Guadalupe bass, like most black bass, are lime to olive green in color, this particular species being lighter in shade usually in river specimens. They have a lateral line covered in mostly separate diamond-shaped or circular spots, which with age fade from black to olive. Also, many smaller diamond marks are scattered on the back, which are less distinguished than the ones on the lateral line. They have a rectangular tooth patch on the tongue.Curtis, S. G., Perkin, J. S., Bean, P. T., Sullivan, M. L., & Bonner, T. H. (2015). Guadalupe Bass Micropterus treculii (Vaillant & Bocourt, 1874). In Black bass diversity: multidisciplinary science for conservation. American Fisheries Society, Symposium (Vol. 82, pp. 55-60). http://sites.tntech.edu/jperkin/wp- content/uploads/sites/29/2015/07/Curtis_et_al_2015.pdf Its physical traits are very similar to the spotted bass (i.e. small mouth that does not extend past the eye, sleek figure, etc.) with one exception; the green coloring tends to extend lower on the body past the lateral line than their relatives.https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/gdb/ So far, the record catch is 3.71 lb (3 lb, 11.36 oz), caught by Dr. Bryan Townsend of Austin in 2014. The fish is only found in Edward's Plateau in central Texas. Its main habitats are the San Marcos, Colorado, Llano, and Guadalupe Rivers.https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/species/gdb/ They can also be found in run-off creeks such as Barton Creek, Onion Creek, San Gabriel River, and the Comal River. The species has also been farm-raised and stocked in the Llano River.  Threats and predators  The Guadalupe bass has almost no predators. Its main threat is not predation, but hybridization with the introduced smallmouth bass. The two species are very closely related and in some rivers almost half the Guadalupe bass are hybrids. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept stated it will likely stock many bass in the future to beat out the hybrid population. This will be a pilot for several other areas where rare spotted bass subspecies are having the same problems.  Habitat  Typically, Guadalupe bass are found in streams and reservoirs; they are absent from extreme headwaters. They prefer flowing waters of streams within native variety, and use covers such as large rocks, cypress trees, or stumps for refuge. Juvenile fish are often found in fast-moving water but begin transitioning to deeper, moderate current towards the end of their first year.Curtis, S. G., Perkin, J. S., Bean, P. T., Sullivan, M. L., & Bonner, T. H. (2015). Guadalupe Bass Micropterus treculii (Vaillant & Bocourt, 1874). In Black bass diversity: multidisciplinary science for conservation. American Fisheries Society, Symposium (Vol. 82, pp. 55-60). http://sites.tntech.edu/jperkin/wp- content/uploads/sites/29/2015/07/Curtis_et_al_2015.pdf  Diet  The fish (especially juveniles and very old fish), unlike other bass, have an inclination towards insects. Guadalupe bass at their predatory peak prefer larger bait fish such as shad and small bass or bluegills.Curtis, S. G., Perkin, J. S., Bean, P. T., Sullivan, M. L., & Bonner, T. H. (2015). Guadalupe Bass Micropterus treculii (Vaillant & Bocourt, 1874). In Black bass diversity: multidisciplinary science for conservation.

It is prized for its long, tough fights, in which it manipulates the current and its unusually strong muscles, and beautiful colors which tend to be more natural and bright than those of spotted bass. Its preference for strong current and its large diet of insects earned it the name \\"Texas brook trout\\" and make it popular for fly fishermen. It fights similarly to both smallmouth bass and rainbow trout‚Äîmaking long runs and manipulating current, but also making sharp turns and attempting to entangle the line on structures, and even making large jumps like both species. The IGFA all-tackle world record for the species stands at 1.67 kg (3 lb 11 oz) caught in Lake Travis in Texas in 1983.

Modified by Carroll Shelby for 1987 and in Graphic Red only, the Shelby Lancer was intended to be an American counterpart to such European sedans as the BMW 3 Series and Peugeot 405. It was well equipped inside with many amenities not offered on the normal Lancer, including a special 10-speaker Pioneer CD audio system, one of the first Compact Disc systems offered in an American car. There were only 800 of these cars made in total; 400 came with a 3-speed Automatic transmission (A413) and leather interior, and 400 with a 5-speed Manual transmission (A520) and cloth interior. Other Shelby-branded items included a numbered plaque attached to the dashboard along with Shelby 15 inch wheels, a Shelby steering wheel, and a Shelby valve cover. The various VIN plates and build labels on the car all indicated \\"Shelby Automobiles\\" instead of the typical Chrysler or Dodge labels found on normal production vehicles. Power came from a Chrysler supplied, Shelby tuned Turbo II 2.2 Liter Intercooled SOHC I4, with 175 hp (130 kW) and 175 ft¬∑lbf (237 Nm). Weight was just over 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) with the average driver, so performance was not as good as the lighter and lesser-equipped Shelby GLHS. It took about 7.2 seconds to get to and quarter mile times were in the mid to high 15-second range with factory boost levels peaking at about 12 PSI. Road handling was quite good for a sedan at the time, pulling an advertised 0.85 g on the skidpad. Ride comfort was stiff but not unbearable, providing a good balance between a sport suspension coupe and a touring sedan. Goodyear Gatorback tires, Monroe Formula GP struts and larger sway bars were used to provide a firmer suspension with better grip. Shelby also used an experimental (at the time) 4-wheel disc brake system to improve braking. Dodge carried on the car with the 1988 and 1989 Lancer Shelby, which is not to be confused with the true Shelby car which was assembled in Whittier, California. The Dodge version is actually more rare despite being factory produced but wasn't numbered and had different Shelby-specific parts.

He is known for his role on the hit TV series Baywatch playing a fictional lifeguard sharing his real name. He became an actor on the show after having been originally hired as a consultant. Early life Newman started his career as a lifeguard at the age of 10 when he joined the junior lifeguards. He excelled at swimming and water sports and attended Pacific Palisades High School. He later attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he majored in advertising. Newman took the firefighter's exam while waiting to be hired as a lifeguard. He soon found the two to be compatible. He has an older brother who is a Los Angeles County Lifeguard. Baywatch In 1989, Newman joined his friend and fellow lifeguard, Greg Bonann, as a technical consultant on Bonann's television show, Baywatch. Newman also made frequent appearances on the show as an actor, making him the only real lifeguard featured on the show. He remained on the show through its entire run, becoming a regular cast member in the opening credits in 1996. The exposure from the show made him an international star over the years. Newman even had his own official fan club at the height of his popularity. Many of the rescue scenes on the show were reenacted from actual rescues Newman participated in as a lifeguard. In 1996, Newman won the lifeguarding National Ironman Championship. Newman currently lives in Pacific Palisades, California with his wife, Sarah, and their two children, a son, Chris and a daughter, Emily, where he sells real estate. In November 2011, Newman revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease after seeking medical attention for a hand tremor.

He represented Silicon Valley as a member of the California State Assembly for 30 years and a California State Senator for 8 years. His lifelong interest in psychology led to his advocacy of the self-esteem movement in California politics. Early life Vasconcellos came from Portuguese (paternal) and German (maternal) roots. He graduated from Bellarmine College Preparatory and Santa Clara University. After graduating magna cum laude and valedictorian of his class from Santa Clara, Vasconcellos spent two years as a lieutenant in the United States Army, serving in West Germany. Upon his return, he reenrolled in SCU, obtaining a law degree in 1959. He joined the law firm of Ruffo & Chadwick; after a year, he joined the staff of Governor Pat Brown for one year before returning to the firm. Career In 1966, Vasconcellos ran for and won a seat in the California State Assembly, taking office January 2, 1967. (Legislative sessions since 1972 have begun on the first Monday in December of even- numbered years.)https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_4,_Rules_Governing_State_Legislative_Sessions_(1972). By 1980 he was one of the longest serving members of the Assembly, second only to Speaker Willie Brown. Due to the Assembly's policy of awarding leadership positions based on seniority, he became the chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful assignments in the California Legislature. Vasconcellos proposed the State Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem in October 1986. In 1989, Brown appointed Vasconcellos to chair the Select Assembly Committee on Ethics. Vasconcellos held the positions until he was forced out of the Assembly in 1996 by term limits. He then ran for, and won, a seat in the California State Senate, again representing Silicon Valley. In the State Senate, he chaired the Public Safety, Education, and Economic Development committees. Vasconcellos served two terms in the State Senate, again forced to retire by term limits. Throughout his long public career Vasconcellos worked to illuminate the link between personal psychology and politics.John Vasconcellos: The New Politics by Hal Plotkin San Jose Metro 1992-10-29. In March 2004, Vasconcellos introduced Senate Bill 1606, known as Training Wheels for Citizenship, which would allow people 14 or older to vote. The votes of 14- and 15-year-olds would count as a quarter of a vote, and of 16- and 17-year-olds a half. The National Youth Rights Association supported the bill, but Republican legislators criticized it. Bob Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies, compared this bill's fractional vote to the policy of the Three-Fifths Compromise, which gave slaves three-fifths representation in the early history of the U.S. Vasconcellos abandoned the bill after it fell one vote short in the final committee. Vasconcellos was also a leading champion of medical marijuana. In 1995, he sponsored AB 1529, a bill to legalize personal possession and cultivation of marijuana for medical use. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Wilson, but provided the blueprint for California's pioneering medical marijuana initiative, Proposition 215. He went on to sponsor the California Research Act of 1999 (SB 847), which established the California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at U.C. San Diego, and the Medical Marijuana Program Act of 2004 (SB 420), which created a state ID card system for medical marijuana patients and authorized the distribution and cultivation of medical marijuana by patient collectives or cooperatives, laying the groundwork for the legal establishment of California's many medical marijuana clubs and dispensaries. =Later career= After representing the Silicon Valley for 38 years in the California Legislature, Vasconcellos retired on November 30, 2004. In order to carry forward the vision and leadership of Vasconcellos' politics, friends and colleagues created The Vasconcellos Project. As its first initiative, The Vasconcellos Project launched the Politics of Trust Network (PTN), a civic engagement enterprise that seeks to become a prime mover in advancing this new vision and practice of politics. Vasconcellos had the second-longest career of an elected state legislator in California history (after Ralph C. Dills of southern California) and the longest in terms of continuous service. He was known for his work on public education and the state budget during his career in the legislature. Death Vasconcellos died in San Jose, California from multiple organ failure, thirteen days after his 82nd birthday.

This procedure is most commonly performed to treat oncologic conditions of the pelvis. Hemipelvectomy can be further classified as internal and external hemipelvectomy. An internal hemipelvectomy is a limb-sparing procedure where the innominate bone is resected while preserving the ipsilateral limb. An external hemipelvectomy involves the resection of the innominate bone plus amputation of the ipsilateral limb.  Medical Uses  Hemipelvectomy is generally reserved for the treatment of pelvic neoplasms. Examples of malignancies that are treated with hemipelvectomy include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. Rarely, hemipelvectomy is performed in settings of traumatic injury and osteomyelitis. Indications for external hemipelvectomy include neoplastic extension into the sciatic nerve, where loss of function of the lower extremity is anticipated. Internal hemipelvectomy is preferred when complete resection of the tumor is possible without sacrificing the lower extremity. If external hemipelvectomy cannot provide a greater degree of tumor resection compared to internal hemipelvectomy, internal hemipelvectomy is recommended. Internal hemipelvectomy must only be considered when the surgical approach can ensure the preservation of critical neurovascular structures in the region.  Complications  As with any surgical procedure, risks include infection, blood loss, damage to surrounding structures, cardiac/pulmonary complications, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. Risks of external hemipelvectomy include: * Disfigurement * Loss of ambulation * Phantom limb pain * Bladder dysfunction * Sexual dysfunction * Bowel dysfunction Risks of internal hemipelvectomy include: * Leg-length discrepancy * 'Flail hip' or 'floating hip' (referring to hypermobility of the hip joint) * Hip instability  Technique  Prior to performing a hemipelvectomy, surgeons must possess detailed knowledge of the pelvic anatomy and its relation to the pelvic tumor. Imaging studies such as conventional radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging help the surgeon visualize the anatomy and its relationship to the local pathology. Surgical oncology techniques are utilized when resecting tumors of the pelvis. Such techniques ensure that adequate resection margins are obtained at the time of surgery to minimize tumor recurrence. The Enneking and Dunham classification system was developed in 1978 to aid surgeons in characterizing pelvic resections. This classification scheme breaks down pelvic resections into 3 subtypes: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Type I resections involve removal of the ilium. Type II resections involve removal of the peri-acetabular region. Type III resections involve removal of the ischial and/or pubic region. Resection of pelvic bone typically requires subsequent reconstruction to ensure stability of the hip joint, particularly in internal hemipelvectomy. Examples of pelvic reconstruction include the use of an allograft, autograft, or prosthesis to bridge the remaining ends of pelvic bone following resection. Arthrodesis is a technique that can be used in internal hemipelvectomy to fix the proximal femur to a segment of pelvic bone for the purposes of stabilizing the lower extremity.

It first flew in 1990, intended for the Soviet Air Forces, and it entered service in 2014 with the Russian Air Force. Based on the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker air superiority fighter, the Su-34 has an armored cockpit for side-by-side seating of its two-man crew. The Su-34 is designed primarily for tactical deployment against ground and naval targets (tactical bombing/attack/interdiction roles, including against small and mobile targets) on solo and group missions in daytime and at night, under favourable and adverse weather conditions and in a hostile environment with counter-fire and electronic Warfare (EW) counter-measures deployed, as well as for aerial reconnaissance. The Su-34 will eventually replace the Su-24 tactical strike fighter and the Tu-22M3 long-distance bomber. Development The Su-34 had a muddied and protracted beginning. In the mid-1980s, Sukhoi began developing a new tactical multirole combat aircraft to replace the swing-wing Su-24, which would incorporate a host of conflicting requirements. The bureau thus selected the Su-27, which excelled in maneuverability and range, and could carry a large payload, as the basis for the new fighter-bomber. More specifically, the aircraft was developed from , the naval trainer derivative of the Sukhoi Su-27K. The development, known internally as T-10V, was shelved at the end of the 1980s sharing the fate of the aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk; this was the result of the political upheaval in the Soviet Union and its subsequent disintegration. In August 1990, a photograph taken by a TASS officer showed an aircraft making a dummy approach towards the aircraft carrier Tbilisi. The aircraft, subsequently and erroneously labelled Su-27KU by Western intelligence, made its maiden flight on 13 April 1990 with Anatoliy Ivanov at the controls. Converted from an Su-27UB with the new distinctive nose, while retaining the main undercarriage of previous Su-27s, it was a prototype for the Su-27IB (IB stands for istrebitel-bombardirovshchik, or \\"fighter bomber\\"). It was developed in parallel with the two-seat naval trainer, the Su-27KUB. However, contrary to earlier reports, the two aircraft are not directly related.Andrews, Thomas, \\"Sukhoi Su-27/Su-30 Family,\\" International Air Power Review, Volume 8, Spring 2003. Flight tests continued throughout 1990 and into 1991. RAF over the Baltic in 2015 In 1992, the Su-27IB was displayed to the public at the MosAeroshow (later renamed \\"MAKS Airshow\\"), where it demonstrated aerial refuelling with an Il-78, and performed an aerobatic display. The aircraft was officially unveiled on 13 February 1992 at Machulishi, where Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the CIS leaders were holding a summit. The following year the Su-27IB was again displayed at the MAKS Airshow. The next prototype, and first pre-production aircraft, T10V-2, first flew on 18 December 1993, with Igor Votintsev and Yevgeniy Revoonov at the controls. Built at Novosibirsk, where Su-24s were constructed, this aircraft was visibly different from the original prototype; it had modified vertical stabilizers, twin tandem main undercarriage and a longer \\"stinger\\", which houses an N012 rearward-facing warning radar, plus the drag chute and as well as fuel jettison outlet. The first aircraft built to production standard made its first flight on 28 December 1994. It was fitted with a fire-control system, at the heart of which was the Leninets OKB-designed V004 passive electronically scanned array radar. It was different enough from the earlier versions that it was re-designated the \\"Su-34\\". However, at the 1995 Paris Air Show, the aircraft was allocated the \\"Su-32FN\\" designation, signalling the aircraft's potential role as a shore-based naval aircraft for the Russian Naval Aviation. Sukhoi also promoted the Su-34 as the \\"Su-32MF\\" (MnogoFunksionalniy, \\"multi-function\\"). Budget restrictions caused the programme to stall repeatedly. Nevertheless, flight testing continued, albeit at a slow pace. The third pre-production aircraft first flew in late 1996. Russia's Ministry of Defence plans to modernize the Su-34; according to the deputy head of the military department, Yuriy Borisov, \\"We are planning to modernize the aircraft: prolong its service life, increase the number of airborne weapons. Plane is in great demand in our armed forces, and it has a great future.\\" Russia is developing two new versions of the aircraft: one for electronic warfare (L700 Tarantul ECM pod can provide electronic cover for a group of aircraft) and one for Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Su-34M modernised version will feature a new electro-optical infrared targeting pod, a Kopyo-DL rearward facing radar that can warn the pilots if missiles are approaching, combined with automatic deployment of countermeasures and jamming. = Orders and deliveries = An initial batch of eight aircraft was completed by the Novosibirsk factory in 2004. In March 2006, Russia's Minister of Defence Sergei Ivanov announced the purchase of the first five pre-production Su-34s for the Russian Air Force. In late 2008, a second contract was signed for delivery of 32 aircraft by 2015. A total of 70 aircraft were to be purchased by 2015 to replace some 300 Su-24s in service at the time, which were then undergoing a modernization program. Ivanov claimed that as it is \\"many times more effective on all critical parameters\\", fewer of these newer bombers are required than the old Su-24 it replaces. In December 2006, Ivanov revealed that approximately 200 Su-34s were expected to be in service by 2020; and was confirmed by Air Force chief Vladimir Mikhaylov on 6 March 2007. Two Su-34s were delivered in 2006‚Äì2007, and three more were delivered by the end of 2009. MAKS 2013 On 9 January 2008, Sukhoi reported that the Su-34 had begun full-rate production. The final stage of the state tests were completed on 19 September 2011. The Russian Air Force received another four Su-34s on 28 December 2010, as combat units in airbases first received six Su-34s in 2011. Delivery came in the form of two contracts, the first in 2008 for 32 aircraft and the second in 2012 for a further 92 aircraft, totaling 124 to be delivered by 2020.https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2012-03-09/russia-orders- another-92-su-34-strike-fighters In December 2012, Sukhoi reportedly delivered five aircraft under the 2012 State Defence Order. In January 2013, Sukhoi delivered a batch of five Su-34s, flying directly from the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant to an air base in Voronezh. On 6 May 2013, the first Su-34s under the 2013 defence procurement plan were delivered. On 9 July 2013, three more Su-34s were delivered in an official acceptance ceremony held at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. By the end of 2013, Sukhoi completed the 2008 contract and started deliveries of aircraft under the 2012 contract.https://www.ruaviation.com/news/2013/12/16/2093/ In August 2013, Sukhoi signed a contract with the Kazan-based Radiopribor holding company for 184 Identification friend or foe transponders for the Russian Su-34s to be delivered by 2020. On 10 June 2014, a further delivery of Su-34s was made to the 559th Bomber Aviation Regiment at Morozovsk Air Base. Another three aircraft were delivered on 18 July 2014. In total, 18 aircraft were delivered in 2014, with 20 planned to be delivered in 2015. Sukhoi has delivered the first batch of Su-34s under the 2015 defence procurement plan on 21 May 2015. On 16 July 2015, the Sukhoi Company handed over another batch of Su-34 frontline bombers to the Russian Defence Ministry. The transfer took place in the framework of the Unified Military Hardware Acceptance Day in the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association Plant. After eight years of negotiations, Rosoboronexport received official request to supply the Su-34 for the Algerian Air Force. Last two Su-34s of the 2012 contract were delivered to the 968th Fighter Aviation Regiment at the Lipetsk Air Base in August 2020. This brought the total number of operational aircraft delivered to the Russian Air Force to 129 (not counting crashes and aircraft written off). Apart from this, seven pre-production units were also built under previous contracts. On 25 August 2020, the Russian Defence Ministry signed third contract to deliver a further 24 Su-34 aircraft for the Russian Air Force. The deliveries will stretch over 3 years. Design Russian Air Force Su-34 The Su-34 shares most of its wing structure, tail, and engine nacelles with the Su-27/Su-30, with canards like the Su-30MKI, Su-33, and Su-27M/35 to increase static instability (higher manoeuvrability) and to reduce trim drag. The Su-34 is powered by a pair of Saturn AL-31FM1 turbofan engines, the same engines used on the Su-27SM; giving the aircraft a maximum speed of Mach 1.8+ when fully loaded. Although having a slower maximum speed than the standard Su-27, the Su-34 can still handle high G-loads and perform aerobatic maneuvers. When equipped with a full weapons load, the Su-34 has a maximum range of without refuelling, this can be extended further via aerial refueling. The airframe is also cleared to perform maneuvers of up to +9 g. The noise level of the Su-34 is two times lower than the level of its predecessors. The Su-34 is a three-surface design having both a conventional horizontal tailplane at the rear and a canard foreplane in front of the main wings. The foreplane provides both additional lift (force) and greater maneuverability. It has twin tail fins like those of Su-27 from which it is derived. The Su-34 has 12 hardpoints for 8,000 kg (17,600 lb) of ordnance, intended to include the latest Russian precision-guided weapons. It retains the Su-27/Su-30's 30 mm GSh-30-1 cannon, and the ability to carry R-77 air-to- air missiles (6 pcs) and R-73 (also 6), with the air-to-air missiles being primarily for defense against pursuers if detected by the rearward facing radar. The maximum weight of any single munition carried is 4000 kg, its stand-off weapons have range up to . A Khibiny electronic countermeasures (ECM) system is fitted as standard. Sukhoi Su-34 cockpit simulator Compared to other members of the Su-27 family, the Su-34 has an entirely new nose and forward fuselage with an armored cockpit providing side-by-side seating for a crew of two, and the flattened nosecone earned it the nickname \\"Duckling\\" or the \\"Duckbill\\". This gives the aircraft its most distinctive feature, the unusually large flight deck. Much of the design work went into crew comfort. The two crew members sit side by side in a large cabin, with the pilot- commander to the left and navigator/operator of weapons to the right in NPP Zvezda K-36dm ejection seats. An advantage of the side by side cockpit is that duplicate instruments are not required for each pilot. Since long missions require comfort, the pressurization system allows operation up to without oxygen masks, which are available for emergencies and combat situations. The crew members have room to stand and move about the cabin during long missions. The space between the seats allows them to lie down in the corridor, if necessary. A galley and toilet are located behind the crew seats. A ladder attached to the nose landing gear and a hatch in the cockpit floor is used to enter the cockpit. The cockpit is a continuous capsule of armour (17 mm). The Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS) acts as a command center: precision target designation of all onboard weapons is tied to the movement of the pilot's head and eyes. The multifunctional Leninets V-004 main radar has terrain-following and terrain avoidance modes. Maximum detection range for the passive electronically scanned array forward radar is 200‚Äì250 km (against large surface targets), to cover the rear a second aft-facing radar is mounted. The main radar can simultaneously track ten air targets and attack four targets (in the air, on land or on the water). The radius of detection for fighter-sized targets is up to 120 km, the range of the survey is +/- 60 degrees. The rear warning radar system can warn of attack from behind and allow it to fire its R-73s against pursuers without needing to turn the aircraft. The rear radar is from Phazotron/Rassvet, and is unofficially called the N-012. The Su-34 reportedly has a frontal radar cross-section that is an order of magnitude smaller than prior generation fighters. A new 4th generation radar Pika-M of the complex BKR-3, having a range up to 300 km, passed state tests in 2016. Operational history =Russia= Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bomber The Su-34 is rumoured to have performed its combat debut during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. In July 2010, several Su-34s and Su-24Ms conducted a 6,000 km non-stop flight from air bases in European Russia to the Russian Far East. The exercise included aircraft carrying weapons at full load, simulated delivering them on targets and first shown the Su-34's long- range capability. Su-24Ms were refuelled three times, while the Su-34s were refuelled twice. The final stage of Su-34's state trials was complete on 19 September 2011, and the aircraft entered service in early 2014. Russia plans to have 124 aircraft in use by 2020. This is planned to increase to 200 aircraft later. On 4 June 2015, a Su-34 slid off the runway and flipped over when its parachute failed to open after landing. Nobody was injured. The aircraft was returning from a routine training mission in Russia's Voronezh region. In June 2016, the damaged aircraft was transferred on board an Antonov An-124 to the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association plant for repairs, and was likely returned to service the same year. On 18 January 2019, two Su-34s collided mid-air in Russia's Far East region, while performing a scheduled training flight. Two pilots were killed, one was rescued and one remains missing.https://tass.com/emergencies/1040770 All Su-34 flights have been suspended throughout Russia following the accident. On 6 September 2019, two Su-34s collided mid-air once again, this time in western Russian city of Lipetsk. According to a Russian the collision had happened due to pilots‚Äô error. Despite damages, both pilots managed to land after the accident.https://theaviationgeekclub.com/two-russian-su-34-fullbacks-collided- twice-during-the-same-training-sortie-both-aircraft-landed- safely/https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/russia-2-su-34-fighter-bombers- collide-/1574727 2015 Russian military intervention in Syria An Su-34 at Bassel Al-Assad International Airport in Latakia, Syria, in late 2015, early in Russia's intervention in Syria. In September 2015, six Su-34s arrived at Latakia airport in Syria, for attacks against rebel and ISIL forces. Russian air attacks in Syria started on the 30 September, in the Homs region. On 1 October, the Su-34 was used to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria. The Russian Air Force Su-34 fighter-bombers destroyed an Islamic State command center and training camp south-west of the city of Raqqa. These included precision strikes from an altitude of over 5,000 m (16,400 ft). Russian Su-34 and Su-25 attack aircraft carried out air strikes the next day against Islamic State targets in Syria's Hama province using precision bombs. According to Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, Su-34s hit an ISIL fortified bunker in the Hama province with guided bombs. Fortifications, ammunition depots, seven units of the military equipment near Syria's Maarrat al-Numan were also destroyed by the Russian Air Force. An ISIL command center and underground depot were also destroyed with explosives near Raqqa. Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said in a statement on 3 October, \\"Accurate delivery of a concrete-piercing bomb BETAB-500 launched from a Su-34 aircraft near Raqqa destroyed a hardened command centre of one of the illegal armed groups as well as an underground bunker with explosives and ammunition depot.\\" A Russian Air Force representative stated Su-34s acquire targets using the GLONASS satellite system for bombing. During this time six Su-34s were in Syria maintaining a 70 percent availability rate for sorties. Eight more Su-34s arrived in Syria on 20 November 2015. Following the downing of a Su-24 by Turkey, Russia announced on 30 November 2015 that Su-34s in Syria had begun flying combat missions while armed with air-to-air missiles. On 16 August 2016, Tu-22M3 long-range bombers and Su-34 bombers, having taken off from their base in Hamadan Islamic Republic of Iran, carried out group airstrikes against targets belonging to ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist groups in the provinces of Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor and Idlib. On August 17, 2016, Russian Su-34 bombers carried out strikes from the Hamadan airfield on the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran against targets of the ISIS terrorist group in the province of Deir ez-Zor. Aircraft carried high- explosive bombs OFAB-500. On 3 October 2017, Russian Su-34s and Su-35s were deployed to strike \\"the place of the Al-Nusra leadership meeting\\" whose location uncovered by Russian military intelligence in Syria subsequently eliminating 12 Al-Nusra field commanders and some 50 militants of the group including Ahmad al-Ghizai, Al-Nusra's security chief according to the Russian Defense Ministry. On 28 May 2018, it was reported that Russian Su-34s intercepted two Israeli Air Force F-16s over Tripoli, Lebanon, forcing them to retreat. On 27 February 2020, two Russian Su-34s allegedly carried out an airstrike on a Turkish military convoy killing up to 36 soldiers and injuring at least 60 more in Balyun, Syria. On 6 October 2020, two Russian Su-34s conducted air strikes against underground structures in the Eastern bank of Euphrates, Deir Ez-Zor province inside Rojava territory resulting in the death of an ISIL field commander Abu Qatada who was involved in the preparation of a terrorist attack against the Russian military personnel which killed Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh. Additionally, the strike also destroyed two underground shelters and killed some 30 militants. Other usage The Su-34s were used for bombing ice dams on the rivers in Vologda oblast to prevent the floods during the spring of 2016. =Algeria= In January 2016, Algeria was negotiating a purchase of 12 aircraft for its Air Force. The deal should have been signed in late 2016, but in 2017 the talks were still ongoing and no sale was made. On 27 December 2019, Algeria has reportedly signed a contract for 14 aircraft as part of large military deal that also includes purchase of Su-35 and Su-57 fighters. However, neither Russian nor Algerian governments ever confirmed that such deal exists.

It features the group's interpretations of ten American blues and rhythm and blues songs, including their most popular live number, Howlin' Wolf's \\"Smokestack Lightning\\". The album contains some of the earliest recordings with guitarist Eric Clapton. Recorded at the Marquee Club in London on 20 March 1964, it was released in the United Kingdom by Columbia Records nine months later. Despite several favourable retrospective reviews, the album did not reach the UK album charts. It was not issued in the United States; however, four songs were included on the Yardbirds' second American album, Having a Rave Up. Background and recording In October 1963, the Yardbirds took over the Rolling Stones' position at the Crawdaddy Club and had signed a management contract with club owner Giorgio Gomelsky. After touring with Sonny Boy Williamson II, the band signed a contract with Columbia Records. In 1964, they recorded two singles, \\"I Wish You Would\\" and \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\". These had limited success and Gomelsky was able to persuade Columbia to release a live album as the Yardbirds' debut album. The Yardbirds were a popular live attraction at music clubs. Much of their reputation was built on their use of a \\"rave up\\" musical arrangement, an instrumental interlude that builds to a climax. Clapton credits the rave up to bassist Paul Samwell-Smith and explains: \\"While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, we were taking three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy\\". It was at such performances that Clapton often broke a guitar string. While he was putting on a new one, the audience would slowly clap their hands (slow handclapping). This led manager Gomelsky to nickname him \\"Eric 'Slowhand' Clapton\\". Five Live Yardbirds was recorded at the Marquee Club in London. Yardbirds' biographer Gregg Russo describes the conditions and equipment for recording at the club was less than ideal, but they were able to capitalise on their greater popularity there than at the Crawdaddy. He adds: Composition and musical style All of the songs that appear on Five Live Yardbirds were written by American blues and rhythm and blues artists and several of the original recordings appeared on the American record charts. The band's early material reflects the repertoires of the early British rhythm and blues groups, such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals. Clapton biographer David Bowling described the album as \\"a lot of straight electric blues, but at times they come close to a rock sound.\\" Their version of Chuck Berry's \\"Too Much Monkey Business\\", which is the album opener, is the most rock-oriented song on the album. Several songs feature extended instrumental improvisation. Bo Diddley's \\"Here 'Tis\\" and the Isley Brothers' \\"Respectable\\" are high-energy tunes, which represent the use of double-time feature of the rave up for the entire songs. AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes \\"Here 'Tis\\" as \\"driven by a furious \\"Bo Diddley\\" beat and rhythm ... Clapton's interplay with bassist Paul Samwell-Smith is one of the great moments in the band's recorded history\\". The instrumental spotlight was also shared with singer and blues harmonica player Keith Relf. Clapton and Relf trading riffs is one of the highlights of \\"Smokestack Lightning\\". The Howlin' Wolf song was the Yardbirds' most popular live number and a regular in their sets. Performances of the song could last up to 30 minutes. Howlin' Wolf reportedly referred to the group's 5:35 album version as \\"the definitive version of his song\\". The slow blues standard, \\"Five Long Years\\", features extended guitar soloing by Clapton in a style he further developed with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Clapton and Samwell- Smith share the lead vocals on \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\", which is based on the version by the American R&B; duo Don and Bob. Bo Diddley's \\"I'm a Man\\" (which became a hit when the Yardbirds later recorded it with Jeff Beck) and songs by Slim Harpo and John Lee Hooker round out the album. Release and critical reception Clapton biographer Christopher Sandford notes, \\"When Five Live Yardbirds was released that winter, to generally favourable reviews ('Raucous interplay ... great guitar ...feral energy of the ensemble') it, too, failed to materially benefit the group.\\" The album did not appear in British record charts and subsequently was not issued in the US. Later critics have given favourable reviews. AllMusic's Eder awarded it four and a half out of five stars and described it as \\"the first importantindeed, essentiallive album to come out of the 1960s British rock & roll boom. In terms of the performance captured and the recording quality, it was also the best such live record of the entire middle of the decade\\". In a separate review for AllMusic, Rick Clark noted \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" [and other songs] were open-ended improvisations that helped lay the groundwork for groups like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience.\\" Bowling calls the material \\"raw and powerful\\" and Russo adds it is \\"a completely faithful reproduction\\" of the group's early shows. \\"Ultimate Classic Rock\\" listed the album in its list of \\"Top 100 Live Albums\\", calling it an \\"explosive document of a British blues band fueling a decidedly American music with power, fireworks and amped-up resourcefulness\\". Aerosmith's Joe Perry described himself as \\"a huge fan of Clapton's work on Five Live Yardbirds. Their version of Chuck Berry's 'Too Much Monkey Business' was such a blueprint for a lot of what Aerosmith tried to do. The 'Rave Ups' [instrumental interludes] which were backing up Eric, the solosit was like the band was a slingshot and, as soon as it hit that pocket, he went sailing.

These cars were offered by Shelby Automobiles Inc. from 1987 through 1989. CSX The first of the 750 built 1987 Shelby CSX The first Shelby CSX appeared in 1987. Power came from Shelby's intercooled Turbo II 2.2 L inline-four, producing 175 hp (130 kW) at 5300 rpm and 175 ft¬∑lbf (237 Nm) of torque from 2200-4800 rpm, with a 0 to time of 6.8 seconds. Shock absorbers and springs were replaced, and Daytona Shelby Z rear discs were added. Once again, Shelby used his own wheels. Outside badging was more restrained than other Shelby offerings. Black was the only color available. 750 of the 1987 CSX's were sold, priced at $13,495. There was no optional equipment. CSX-T 1988 Shelby CSX-T In 1966, Shelby created a special line of Shelby Mustangs for the Hertz car rental company. Shelby repeated this method in 1988 with the creation of the CSX-T for the Thrifty rental company. The CSX-T was only sold to Thrifty. All 1,001 units produced were white with grey and blue trim. The CSX-T was mechanically similar to the 1987 CSX, except the non-intercooled Turbo I engine was used. Two variations were made, an intercooled version given to the president of Thrifty and a version with a factory sunroof given to the president's daughter. CSX-VNT The final CSX was 1989's CSX-VNT. This would also be the final Shelby Dodge, and marked two notable technological advances: the introduction of a Garrett variable-nozzle turbo (VNT), which was the first application of variable turbine technology in a production car, and the application of composite wheels designed by Shelby and produced by Motor Wheel Corporation, known as \\"Fiberrides\\", which were lighter than contemporary aluminum wheels. The first 1989 CSX VNT, Carroll Shelby's own car 1989 Shelby CSX VNT The engine was Chrysler's new intercooled Turbo IV equipped with a Getrag A555 5-speed transmission. The variable geometry turbo vanes were computer controlled and needed no wastegate. Instead, they adjusted the flow of exhaust gases to spool up instantly and provide strong power. Chrysler kept the horsepower rating at 175 hp (130 kW), but upped the torque rating to 205 ft¬∑lbs (278 Nm) at 2100 rpm. Full torque was available from this low rpm to well past redline. Turbo lag was eliminated, with full boost (15 psi spike) available at 2100 rpm. Car and Driver magazine called it \\"a high-tech hot rod\\" and \\"a technological showcase\\" and were impressed with the engine's flexibility and top-gear acceleration. (They tested it to .) Synthetic oil and premium fuel were specified for use with this car to prevent turbo overheating and prolong engine life. Rather than a proper tune-up (the VNT's control systems were advanced for the time), replacing the VNT with the simple but lag-prone turbo II was common. Examples with the VNT system intact are today considered more valuable to collectors. Shelby installed emblems in the engine compartment specifying Mobil 1 synthetic oil only, as he did on other Shelby Dodges. These are often missing on long running examples. The suspension was also modified, as the alignment specs are radically different from the other Shelby Dodges. On the exterior, Shelby chose Exotic Red, a mix of bright red and maroon, with gold wheels and trim and a ground effects package produced by Kaminari Aerodynamics to set the VNT apart from the standard CSX. The MSRP was $15,995. Production was limited to 500 vehicles (including two prototypes) and with the completion of cars, Carroll Shelby's direct involvement with Dodge was complete (although he continued to work on projects with Chrysler, often taking advisory roles, which included the development of the Dodge Viper and Viper GTS). The 89 Shelby CSX production figures can be broken down into the following: 15 were equipped as 'two option', coming factory with 225 wide tire option as well as RECARO bucket seats; 2 were used as prototypes; 2 were equipped with non- RECARO and wide optioned tires. The remaining were either RECARO or non-RECARO equipped cars with regular size tires. The front air dams and rear wing can still be purchased from Kaminari Aerodynamics. The wing is now equipped with an LED brake light built into it. The front air dams are slightly different than the original factory piece.

It was manufactured by American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) from May 1950 to August 1956, and 1,418 were produced -- 1,265 for American railroads, 98 for Canadian railroads, 48 for Brazilian and 7 for Mexican railroads. It has a single, 12 cylinder, model 244 engine. Competition ALCO built the RS-3 to compete with EMD, Fairbanks-Morse, and Baldwin Locomotive Works. In 1949, EMD introduced the EMD GP7. In 1950, Fairbanks-Morse introduced the H-16-44. Also in 1950, Baldwin introduced the Baldwin AS-16. In the case of ALCO, Fairbanks-Morse, and Baldwin, each company increased the power of an existing locomotive line from , and added more improvements to create new locomotive lines. All of this was to be more competitive with EMD. ALCO's line was the RS-2, although 31 were built in 1950 with . Fairbanks-Morse's line was the H-15-44. Baldwin's line was the Baldwin DRS-4-4-1500.

Canadian Communications Foundation. It aired on Sunday at noon EST and Tuesday at 11:00 pm EST on CBC Radio One and Saturday at 9 am EST on CBC Radio 2. The program is also available as a podcast, although the podcasts are usually just McLean's stories for studio episodes because of copyright restrictions on recorded music. CBC Radio also formerly aired a separate weekday afternoon program, under the title Vinyl Cafe Stories, which consisted of two previously recorded Dave and Morley stories per episode. The show was produced independently by McLean and sold to the CBC. Each season had approximately 22 new episodes. Half of those were recorded in the studio and the other half were done with live audiences in theatres across Canada and the United States. One episode was recorded onboard VIA Rail's transcontinental passenger train The Canadian from the dome observation car, complete with an audience of passengers and featured a rail travel theme. The musical guest was singer songwriter Reid Jamieson. The Vinyl Cafe stopped touring and producing new episodes following McLean's diagnosis with melanoma in November 2015. McLean announced on December 13, 2016 that he required a second round of treatment, meaning further delay in producing new episodes, and that repeats of past shows would stop airing on CBC Radio One effective January 2017 to \\"make room for others to share their work on the radio.\\" McLean died on February 15, 2017. Content The show featured essays, fiction and music; while frequently humorous, the weekly programs were also often wistfully nostalgic. The live episodes often began with Stuart reciting a complimentary description of the venue's community about its character and history. The show also endeavoured to introduce listeners to new Canadian musical talent, through playing recordings in studio episodes and performances in the live audience ones. A major feature of many of McLean's shows were the \\"Dave and Morley Stories\\", which featured a fictional Toronto family. The name \\"Vinyl Cafe\\" referred both to the show's musical content and the fictional record shop owned by McLean's character Dave. This aspect of the show had spawned a number of books of short stories, as well as audio recordings. Another feature was \\"The Vinyl Cafe Story Exchange\\", where listeners were invited to send in personal true stories to the producers who read selections on air. The series also presented an annual set of awards that were called the \\"Arthur Awards\\", which were intended to commend various people who had performed extraordinary good deeds in the preceding year. Every episode ended with McLean's signature sign-off, \\"I'm Stuart McLean, so long for now\\" and followed by the show's folksy guitar theme song, \\"Happy Meeting In Glory\\" (as performed by Ry Cooder). The show was produced by Jess Milton. Meg Masters was the \\"long- suffering\\" story editor and the show's founding producer was Dave Amer. Julie Penner was the musical director. Since 2012 the show has also aired a \\"best of\\" spin-off series under the new title of Vinyl Cafe Stories. It features previously recorded stories about Dave and Morley and organized around a common theme, and with one or two studio-recorded musical tracks, but without the live music or local introductions typical of the original run of the show. = Dave and Morley Stories = Although they are not featured in every episode of The Vinyl Cafe, the \\"Dave and Morley Stories\\" were by far the show's most famous segment. The stories, written and read by McLean, himself, described the many misadventures of Dave, his wife Morley, their children and pets, as well as friends and neighbours. For his live performances, McLean often altered his more well-known stories to keep his audience engaged.

Born and reared in South Carolina to a prominent, wealthy planter family, she moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the 1820s and became a Quaker, as did her younger sister Angelina. The sisters began to speak on the abolitionist lecture circuit, joining a tradition of women who had been speaking in public on political issues since colonial days, including Susanna Wright, Hannah Griffitts, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Anna Dickinson. They recounted their knowledge of slavery firsthand, urged abolition, and also became activists for women's rights. Early life Sarah Grimk√© - her parents sometimes called her \\"Sally\\"- was born in South Carolina, the sixth of 14 children and the second daughter of Mary Smith and John Faucheraud Grimk√©. Their father was a rich planter, an attorney and judge in South Carolina, and at one point Speaker of the South Carolina House of Representatives. Sarah's early experiences with education shaped her future as an abolitionist and feminist. Throughout her childhood, she was keenly aware of the inferiority of her education when compared to her brothers' classical one. Although her family recognized her remarkable intelligence, she was prevented from obtaining a substantive education or pursuing her dream of becoming an attorney, as these goals were considered \\"unwomanly.\\"Lumpkin, Shirley. \\"American Women Prose Writers: 1820‚Äì1870\\" in Hudock, Amy E. and Rodier, Katharine. (eds.) Dictionary of Literary Biography v. 239. Detroit: Gale Group, 2001. From Literature Resource Center She was educated by private tutors on subjects considered appropriate for a young Southern woman of her class,Taylor, Marion Ann and Heather E. Weir (2006).

VanBurkleo, and Mary Jo Miles. Grimk√©, Sarah Moore, American National Biography Online, February 2000. Retrieved November 26, 2015. Her father allowed Sarah to study geography, history, and mathematics from the books in his library, and to read his law books; however, he drew the line at her learning Latin. Sarah's mother Mary was a dedicated homemaker and an active member in the community. She was a leader in Charleston's Ladies Benevolent Society. Mary was also an active Episcopalian and consequently often devoted herself to the poor and to women incarcerated in a nearby prison. Mary's beliefs were rigid; in addition, her many charitable activities kept her from developing affectionate relationships with her children.Durso (2003). Feeling confined in her role, Sarah developed a connection to her family's slaves to an extent that unsettled her parents. From the time she was 12 years old, Sarah spent her Sunday afternoons teaching Bible classes to the young slaves on the plantation, an experience she found frustrating. While she desperately wanted to teach them to read the Scripture for themselves, and they had a longing for such learning, her parents prohibited this, as teaching slaves to read was illegal. Her parents also said that literacy would only make the slaves unhappy and rebellious, making them unfit for manual labor. Teaching slaves to read had been prohibited since 1740 in South Carolina. Sarah secretly taught Hetty, her personal enslaved girl, to read and write, but when her parents discovered the young tutor at work, the vehemence of her father's response proved alarming. He was furious and nearly had the young slave girl whipped. Fear of causing trouble for the slaves themselves prevented Sarah from undertaking such a task again. Years afterward, she reflected on the incident, writing \\"I took an almost malicious satisfaction in teaching my little waiting maid at night, when she was supposed to be occupied in combing and brushing my locks. The light was put out, the keyhole screened, and flat on our stomachs before the fire, with the spelling book under our eyes, we defied the laws of South Carolina.\\" Sarah's brother Thomas went to Yale Law School in 1805. During his visits back home, Thomas continued teaching Sarah new ideas about the dangers of Enlightenment and the importance of religion. (Thomas, a \\"colonizationist\\", died young, and was described in an obituary as most proud of his piety.) These ideas, combined with her secret studies of the law, gave her some of the basis for her later work as an activist. Her father told her that if she had been a man, she would have been the greatest lawyer in South Carolina. Lerner gives a somewhat different version, in which her father said \\"she would have made the greatest jurist in the country.\\" Lerner (1998), p. 25. Sarah believed her inability to get higher education was unfair. She wondered at the behavior of her family and neighbors, who encouraged slaves to be baptized and to attend worship services, but did not consider them true brothers and sisters in faith. From her youth, Sarah believed that religion should take a more proactive role in improving the lives of those who suffered most. Her religious quest took her first to Presbyterianism; she converted in 1817. After moving to Philadelphia in 1821, she joined the Quakers, whom she had learned about in an earlier visit with her father. There, she became an outspoken advocate for education and suffrage for African Americans and women.Grimk√©, Sarah. Letter addressed to Mary S. Parker, President of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, in Letters on the Equality of the Sexes. Becoming an abolitionist By 1817, Sarah's father was seriously ill, and the doctors of Charleston recommended he travel to Philadelphia to consult Philip Syng Physick. Despite her vehement objections, her father insisted that Sarah, then 26 years old, accompany him as his nursemaid. Sarah relented, and they left Charleston for the north in May, 1819. When Physick found he could not help, he suggested that they take in the sea air of the fishing village of Long Branch, New Jersey. The pair settled into a boardinghouse, where, after just a few weeks, John Faucheraud Grimk√© died.Ceplair (1989), p. xv. As a result of this experience, Sarah became more self-assured, independent, and morally responsible. She decided she would not make her home in South Carolina: She stayed in Philadelphia a few months after her father died and met Israel Morris, who would introduce her to Quakerism, specifically the writings of John Woolman.Lerner (1998) She returned to Charleston but decided that she would go back to Philadelphia to become a Quaker minister and leave her Episcopalian upbringing behind. She was stymied, however, when she was repeatedly ignored and shut out by the male-dominated Quaker council. Becoming alienated, she later wrote, \\"I think no criminal under sentence of death can look more fearfully to the day of execution than I do towards our Yearly Meeting.\\" She returned to Charleston in the spring of 1827 to \\"save\\" her sister Angelina from the limitations of the South. Angelina visited Sarah in Philadelphia from July to November of the same year and returned to Charleston committed to the Quaker faith. After leaving Charleston, Angelina and Sarah traveled around New England speaking on the abolitionist circuit, at first addressing women only in large parlors and small churches. Their speeches concerning abolition and women's rights reached thousands. In November, 1829, Angelina joined her sister in Philadelphia.Ceplair (1989). They had long had a close relationship; for years, Angelina called Sarah \\"mother\\", as Sarah was both her godmother and primary caretaker. In 1868, Sarah discovered that her late brother had three illegitimate mixed-race sons by a \\"personal\\" enslave woman. Welcoming them into the family, Sarah worked to provide funds to educate Archibald Grimk√© and Francis James Grimk√©, who went on to successful careers and marriages, and were leaders in the African-American community. John, the youngest, was not interested in formal education and returned to the South to live. Activism Sarah and Angelina had come to loathe slavery and all its degradations. They had hoped that their new faith would be more accepting of their abolitionist beliefs than their former had been. However, their initial attempts to attack slavery caused them difficulties in the Quaker community. The sisters persisted despite their belief that the fight for women's rights was as important as the fight to abolish slavery. Although Sarah had the desire to 'equip women for economic independence and for social usefulness' [22], they continued to be attacked, even by some abolitionists, who considered their position extreme. In 1836, Sarah published An Epistle to the Clergy of the Southern States. In 1837, Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Women was published serially in a Massachusetts newspaper, The Spectator, and immediately reprinted in The Liberator, the newspaper published by radical abolitionist and women's rights leader William Lloyd Garrison. The letters were published in book form in 1838. When the sisters were together in Philadelphia, they devoted themselves to charity work and to the Society of Friends (the proper name for the religion often called \\"Quaker\\"). Sarah began working toward becoming a clergy member but was continually discouraged by male members of the church. Sarah realized that, though the church was something she agreed with in theory, it was not delivering on its promises. It was around this time that anti-slavery rhetoric began entering public discourse. Joining her sister in the American Anti- Slavery Society in 1836, Sarah originally felt that she had found the place where she truly belonged, in which her thoughts and ideas were encouraged. However, as she and Angelina began speaking not only on abolition but also on the importance of women's rights, they began to face much criticism. Their public speeches were seen as unwomanly because they spoke to mixed-gender audiences, called \\"promiscuous audiences\\" at the time. They also publicly debated men who disagreed with them. This was too much for the general public of 1837 and caused many harsh attacks on their womanhood; one line of thought suggested that they were both just poor \\"spinsters\\" displaying themselves in order to find any man who would be willing to take one. In 1838, Angelina married Theodore Weld, a leading abolitionist who had been a severe critic of their inclusion of women's rights into the abolition movement. She retired to the background of the movement while being a wife and mother, though not immediately. Sarah completely ceased to speak publicly. Apparently Weld had recently written her a letter detailing her inadequacies in speaking. He tried to explain that he wrote this out of love for her, but said that she was damaging the cause, not helping it, unlike her sister. However, as Sarah received many requests to speak over the following years (as did Angelina), it is questionable whether her \\"inadequacies\\" were as bad as he described. During the Civil War, Sarah wrote and lectured in support of President Abraham Lincoln. Sarah Moore Grimk√© was the author of the first developed public argument for women's equality. She worked to rid the United States of slavery, Christian churches which had become \\"unchristian,\\" and prejudice against African Americans and women. Her writings gave suffrage workers such as Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott several arguments and ideas that they would need to help end slavery and begin the women's suffrage movement.Million, Joelle, Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement. Praeger, 2003. , pp. 36, 68, 160. Sarah Grimke is categorized as not only an abolitionist but also a feminist because she challenged the Society for Friends, which touted women's inclusion but denied her. It was through her abolitionist pursuits that she became more sensitive to the restrictions on women. She so opposed being subject to men that she refused to marry. Both Sarah and Angelina became very involved in the anti-slavery movement and published volumes of literature and letters on the topic. When they became well known, they began lecturing around the country on the issue. At the time women did not speak in public meetings, so Sarah was viewed as a leader in feminist issues. She openly challenged women's domestic roles. She is remembered on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.  Views on faith and creation  Sarah Grimke's view on abolition is clear based on her activism and she was a major female player in the abolition movement. These views were rooted in her Quaker faith and she believed, similar to her sister, that slavery was contrary to God's will. Similarly, her views on women's rights were rooted in the Bible. She had strong opinions especially on the story of creation. She believed Adam and Eve were created equally, unlike many who believed Eve was created as a gift for Adam. She also assigns much of the blame for the fall on Adam, who was tempted by an equal, instead of Eve, who was tempted by a supernatural evil, which is more forgivable given their innocence. This view was a main argument in her \\"Letter 1: The Original Equality of Woman\\"Grimke, Sarah. \\"Letter 1: The Original Equality of Woman\\" (July 11, 1837). pp. 205‚Äì207 which is the foundation of her views of equality of the sexes, which is discussed in more detail in her \\"Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and the Condition of Woman\\". Sarah Grimke used Scripture in most of her writings that demonstrated her dedication to the Quaker faith and her genuine belief in it compatibility with activism. In 1837 Sarah responded to a Pastoral Letter that reinforced Biblical interpretations supporting the role of females in the \\"private sphere\\" only, using Scripture to provide the benefits and power of this position. Sarah responded to this letter also with Scripture, encouraging women to take on a motto of \\" 'The Lord is my light, and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; whom shall I be afraid?' She must feel, if she feels rightly, that she is filling one of the most important duties laid upon her as an accountable being, and that her character, instead of being 'unnatural', is in exact accordance with the will of Him,\\". Her faith and closeness to God were a critical factor in her ability to be unafraid during times of opposition and to argue on behalf of women and slaves well.  Writings  Sarah composed a plethora of letters regarding women and their place in society, specifically within the church, that were later compiled in to a book titled Letters on the Equality of Sexes and the Condition of Women. It is in these letters that she discusses the wrongs done to women that are inconsistent with the Bible and gives advice on how women ought to combat these issues. This book was published in 1838, but her writings and letters, as well as her sister's, had been circulating for years due to the publications of her sisters letters in The Liberator by William Lloyd Garrison. In her first letter, dated January 11, 1837, she states that she relies solely on Scripture because she believes \\"almost everything that has been written on this subject [women's sphere], has been the result of a misconception of simple truths revealed in the Scriptures\\" outlining a clear intent and purpose for the analysis that follows. It is in these letters that she condemns the behavior of American men's treatment of women and slaves simply as a means to promote and benefit themselves. Letters 5-8 are dedicated to the evaluation of the condition of women in different countries, including Asia, Africa, Greenland, and the US, revealing the depth and breadth of her interest in women's issues stretched. Later, she declares that men are equally guilty in \\"the fall\\" (of Adam and Eve in the Bible) of mankind and therefore disproving the eternal punishment previously laid upon women as a result of their irresponsibility. In the conclusion of her letters she acknowledges the striking ideas they pose and the newness to these discussions among Christians, but urges them to \\"investigate them fearlessly and prayerfully, and not shrink from the examination,\\" which was characteristic of her writing and speeches. In popular culture *In 1973 Ruth Bader Ginsburg quoted Sarah Grimk√© as saying \\"I ask for no favor for my sex. All I ask of our brethren is that they take their feet off our necks,\\" when she gave her first oral arguments to the Supreme Court in Frontiero v Richardson; she recited this again in the film RBG (2018). *In 1998, Grimk√© was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.National Women's Hall of Fame, Sarah Grimk√© *Sarah Grimk√© and her sister Angelina Grimk√© Weld appear as main characters in Ain Gordon's 2013 play If She Stood, commissioned by the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia.Salisbury, Stephen. \\"Painted Bride productions on 19th century women touch familiar issues\\", Philadelphia Inquirer (April 26, 2013) *Author Sue Monk Kidd based her novel The Invention of Wings (2014) on the life of Sarah Grimk√©.Bosman, Julie. \\"Oprah Winfrey Picks ‚ÄòInvention of Wings‚Äô for Her Book Club\\", New York Times (December 10, 2013).

The materials used in building these homes were of sound quality and have withstood the wear and tear of the baby boomer generation as well as the test of time. Sharpstown Mall sign History Sharp donated a 300-foot-wide strip of land through the development to the state of Texas for construction of the Southwest Freeway (Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59). This routing ensured easy access from Downtown Houston to homes in the neighborhood, as well as to PlazAmericas (formerly Sharpstown Mall and Sharpstown Center) (1961), Houston's first air- conditioned, enclosed shopping mall. From the 1980 U.S. Census to the 1990 Census, many African-Americans left traditional African-American neighborhoods and entered parts of Southwest Houston such as Sharpstown. The Hispanic population increased by an amount between 1,000 and 3,500 per square mile. Many Asian-Americans also moved into the Sharpstown area, creating one of the largest concentrations of Asian-Americans in Houston. Glenda Kay Joe, an Asian community leader, said in a 1991 Houston Chronicle article that the Sharpstown Civic Association and the Southwest Advocate newspaper opposed Asian-American settlement in Sharpstown.

The 3.9 L V6 was removed in favor of the company's 5.2 L V8 with throttle-body injection. On paper, the swap looked simple since both engines were similar, but the tight space in the Dakota's engine compartment meant removing the engine-driven fan in front and using electric ones instead.

U.S. Gold published various games for home computers, released in 1989, while Sega developed two similarly themed beat 'em up video games in 1990; one released for arcades and another released for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System. Each of the games' stories loosely follow the story of the film, in which Michael Jackson must rescue kidnapped children from the evil Mr. Big, and incorporate synthesized versions of some of the musician's songs.  Home computer versions  Versions of the game were released for the popular 8-bit and 16-bit home computers of the time. They were developed by two small software houses, Irish Emerald Software Ltd and American Keypunch Software, and published by U.K. company U.S. Gold. = Home computer gameplay = The game features four different levels. The first level is a top-down maze-style level. The next level has similar gameplay, riding the motorcycle collecting tokens. The third level is a side- scrolling level based on the \\"Smooth Criminal\\" clip. The player collects ammunition and shoots at gangsters in openings above the player character. The last level involves morphing into a robot and shooting at soldiers in openings, with the player controlling a crosshair.  Arcade version  Different from the home computer version, is an arcade video game by Sega (programming) and Triumph International (audiovisuals), with the help of Jackson which was released on the Sega System 18 hardware. This game suffered from Sega's suicide battery on its arcade board (a battery that, accidentally or otherwise, renders the game unplayable at the end of its lifespan). The arcade has distinctively different gameplay from its computer and console counterparts, focusing more on beat 'em up gameplay elements rather than platform. = Arcade gameplay = The game is essentially a beat-em-up, although Jackson attacks with magic powers instead of physical contact, and has the ability to shoot short-ranged magic power at enemies. The magic power can be charged by holding the attack button to increase the range and damage of the magic power. If up close to enemies, Jackson executes a spinning melee attack using magic power. Screenshot of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker arcade game If the cabinet supports it, up to three people can play simultaneously. All three players play as Jackson, dressed in his suit (white for player 1, red for player 2, black for player 3). Jackson's special attack is termed \\"Dance Magic\\". There are three different dance routines that may be performed, and the player starts with one to three of these attacks per credit (depending on how the machine is set up). Bubbles the chimpanzee, Michael's real-life pet, appears in each level. Once collected or rescued, the chimp transforms Michael into a robotic version of the pop singer that has the ability to shoot laser bursts and missiles and absorb significantly more damage.  Console versions  Home versions of the game were released for Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System home video game systems though the gameplay was completely different from the arcade version. A version was also rated by PEGI for release on Virtual Console, but it never materialized, and it was never specified which version was considered for rerelease. The home console versions were actually based on an evolved version of the home computer version of the game (with gameplay somewhat similar to the Shinobi series), in contrast to the arcade version which was a three-quarters view shooter/fighter type game. The game involves the player controlling the pop star in a quest to save all the kids that have been kidnapped by Mr. Big. The game's levels and music were borrowed from the film (though many of the music tracks were taken from Jackson's Thriller album as well) and the player has the ability to destroy enemies by making them dance. Jackson can become a robot by rescuing a certain child and then grabbing a comet that falls from the sky. Michael Jackson's Moonwalker (Genesis) All Secret Shooting Stars. YouTube. = Home console gameplay = The gameplay is focused on finding children, all of whom resemble Katie from the movie, who are scattered throughout the level, some behind objects such as doors. Most of the objects are empty or contain enemies. Jackson's standard attack is a stylized high kick that is commonly incorporated into his dance routines. If the player continues to hold the kick button, and moves Jackson backwards, he performs his Moonwalk dance move.  Reception  Critical reviews were mixed. Your Sinclair compared the Spectrum version of the game to Gauntlet and Operation Wolf, saying it was well animated and \\"a surprising amount of fun\\". MegaTech said that the Megadrive version was an addictive platform game that had \\"excellent graphics\\". Mega Magazine placed the game at number 91 in their list of the best Megadrive games of all time, saying it was average.Mega(magazine), Top 100 issue 1, page 84  Legacy  Jackson later would go on to have a cameo role in Sega's Space Channel 5 and Space Channel 5: Part 2 music/rhythm games for the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2. Jackson also appeared as a secret character in Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2. The Genesis version of the game is the subject of episode # 63 of \\"Angry Video Game Nerd.\\"  Prototype  A prototype of the Sega Genesis version dated April 24, 1990 surfaced that contains various differences from the final version. Most notably a full Thriller music track is present in the graveyard stage as well as a different final boss battle which is incomplete. Other differences include but are not limited to: changes in level layouts, different cutscenes, as well as minor differences in sound samples and other musical tracks.

Released in July 1965, it contains new studio recordings along with previously released singles. The album features some of the earliest recordings by guitarists Eric Clapton and his replacement Jeff Beck. The Yardbirds' manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, who selected the songs, planned to capitalise on the group's hit \\"For Your Love\\". The album, released as the Yardbirds were preparing for their first American tour, reached number 96 in Billboard's Top LPs chart. It was unissued in the UK, although the songs with Beck were released in August 1965 on the Five Yardbirds EP. Recording and composition For Your Love features three songs from Jeff Beck's first recording sessions with the Yardbirds: \\"I'm Not Talking\\", \\"I Ain't Done Wrong\\", and \\"My Girl Sloopy\\". Eric Clapton provided the guitar for the remainder of the tracks, that include the three Yardbirds singles (with B-sides) released up to that time and two demos which were not released in the UK until the 1980s (see discography for singles information). Clapton, who had left the band four months earlier, is not pictured on the album cover nor mentioned in the liner notes. Group chronicler Gregg Russo notes, \\"The cover was somewhat of a joke, as Jeff Beck was humorously seated in front of a keyboard that he did not play on the album.\\" Charts and reception The album reached number 96 in Billboards Top LPs chart. It was the Yardbirds' first charting album; their British debut, Five Live Yardbirds, did not reach the UK Albums Chart and was not issued in the US. In a retrospective review, AllMusic writer Bruce Eder gave the album three out of five stars, who notes the inconsistency of the Gomelsky-selected material. He describes the songs with Beck as \\"hard, loud, blazing showcases... show[ing] where the band was really heading\\" and although the material with Clapton is \\"primitive\\" compared to his later efforts, it \\"was some of the best blues-based rock & roll of its era [1964].\\" Track listing =Original album= Songwriter credits are taken from the original Epic LP.

Geometric group theory is a relatively new area of mathematics beginning around the late 1980sM. Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups, in \\"Essays in Group Theory\\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75‚Äì263. which explores finitely generated groups, and seeks connections between their algebraic properties and the geometric spaces on which these groups act. He has worked on what mathematicians refer to as billiards, which are dynamical systems based on a convex shape in a plane. He has explored geometric iterations involving polygons, and he has been credited for developing the mathematical concept known as the pentagram map. In addition, he is a bestselling author of a mathematics picture book for young children. His published work usually appears under the name Richard Evan Schwartz. In 2018 he is a professor of mathematics at Brown University. Career Schwartz was born in Los Angeles on August 11, 1966. In his youth he played tennis and enjoyed video games. He attended John F. Kennedy High School in Los Angeles from 1981 to 1984, then earned a B. S. in mathematics from U.C.L.A. in 1987, and then a Ph. D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1991 under the supervision of William Thurston.http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=18909 He taught at the University of Maryland. He is currently the Chancellor's Professor of Mathematics at Brown University. He lives with his wife and two daughters in Barrington, Rhode Island. Schwartz is credited by other mathematicians for introducing the concept of the pentagram map. According to Schwartz's conception, a convex polygon would be inscribed with diagonal lines inside it, by drawing a line from one point to the next point‚Äîthat is, by skipping over the immediate point on the polygon. The intersection points of the diagonals would form an inner polygon, and the process could be repeated. Schwartz observed these geometric patterns, partly by experimenting with computers. He has collaborated with mathematicians Valentin Ovsienko and Sergei Tabachnikov to show that the pentagram map is \\"completely integrable.\\" In his spare time he draws comic books, writes computer programs, listens to music and exercises. He admired the late Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold and dedicated a paper to him. He played an April Fool's joke on fellow mathematics professors at Brown University by sending an email suggesting that students could be admitted randomly, along with references to bogus studies which purportedly suggested that there were benefits to having a certain population of the student body selected at random; the story was reported in the Brown Daily Herald. Colleagues such as mathematician Jeffrey Brock describe Schwartz as having a \\"very wry sense of humor.\\" In 2003, Schwartz was teaching one of his young daughters about number basics and developed a poster of the first 100 numbers using colorful monsters. This project gelled into a mathematics book published in 2010, entitled You Can Count on Monsters for young children which became a bestseller. Each monster has a graphic which gives a mini- lesson about its properties, such as being a prime number or a lesson about factoring; for example, the graphic monster for the number five was a five- sided star or pentagram. He estimated that he wrote the book during 1000 hours. A year after publication, it was featured prominently on National Public Radio in January 2011 and became a bestseller for a few days on the online bookstore Amazon as well as earning international acclaim. The Los Angeles Times suggested that the book helped to \\"take the scariness out of arithmetic.\\" Mathematician Keith Devlin, on NPR, agreed, saying that Schwartz \\"very skillfully and subtly embeds mathematical ideas into the drawings. He's been compared to a mathematical version of Dr. Seuss.

It is the only bird in the genus Psarisomus. The long-tailed broadbill is about 25 cm (10 inches) in length and weighs between 50 and 60 grams. It can be identified by its shrill call. The Long-tailed Broadbill displays a yellow plumage on the throat. Blueish-green plumage on the belly, back, and wings. The long-tailed broadbill is a forest bird that lives on insects. It is very sociable and normally travels in large, noisy parties except during the mating season. It builds a pear-shaped nest in a tree. The female usually lays between 5 and 6 eggs that are incubated by both sexes; both sexes also help to feed the young.  Taxonomy  The long-tailed broadbill is a songbird (Passeriformes) that belongs in the family Eurylaimidae, a group of birds that have broad heads and have flat, broad beak. It is the only bird that belongs to the genus Psarisomus. The scientific name commemorates Christina Broun, Countess of Dalhousie (1786‚Äì1839), wife of George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie. There are currently five subspecies that are recognized: * P. d. dalhousiae ‚Äì Himalayan foothills E from N India (Uttarakhand) and Nepal, SE Bangladesh, and from N Myanmar and S China (W & S Yunnan, SW Guizhou, SW Guangxi) S to N Thailand, Laos and C Vietnam (C Annam); reported also from SE Tibet. * P. d. cyanicauda ‚Äì SE Thailand and Cambodia. * P. d. divinus ‚Äì S Vietnam (S Annam). * P. d. psittacinus ‚Äì Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra. * P. d. borneensis 1904 ‚Äì N Borneo.  Description  Adult long-tailed broadbills have a bright yellow throat and face, where the yellow patch ranges on each side of the occiput. The yellow feathers continue down to a form a thin band around the neck. There is a thin layer of pale-yellow/whitish feathers that envelops the yellow patch below their throat. Some even have a hint of pale yellow-green on their chin. They have a helmet-like black cap with a sleek blue patch on the crown and a smaller blue patch at the back of their neck. The feathers along the back, belly and top of the wings are bright green produced by a combination of pigmentary and structural color. The underparts of the wings are a lighter green or blueish green. The primary feathers are black, with a metallic blue margin at the base of the external web and a white spot on the base of the inner web.From Naina Devi Himalayan Bird Conservation Reserve, Uttarakhand, India.Long-tailed broadbill have a long blue tail, but the under-tail is black.Jeyarajasingam, Allen. A Field Guide to the Birds of Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 2012. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/mcgill/detail.action?docID=886477. They have strong, broad bill that is yellowish green in color with lighter edges. They have a pea-green toes and brown legs. Juvenile long-tailed broadbills have a shorter tail, green head with duller plumage. A full-grown adult stand about 10 inches in length (25 cm) and weighs anywhere between 50 and 60 grams.  Habitat and Distribution  From alt=The long-tailed broadbill is found in the Himalayas and Myanmar and discontinuously found through South-East Asia and the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra and Borneo. They are distributed in a variety of countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, China, Malaysia and Indonesia. They are commonly found in broad- leaved evergreen forests, ranging in altitudes from 150 to 2500 meters. Their natural habitats include: forests, streams and creeks, tropical and subtropical moist lowland forests, tropical and subtropical moist mountain forests. They seem to have a habitat preference nears small bodies of water such as streams, freshwater and wetlands. They are resident, non-migratory species. The populations of long-tailed broadbills that live in the higher altitudes of the Himalayas often move down to lower altitudes during cold winter months.  Behavior  Long-tailed broadbills are social birds that are usually seen foraging about in small flocks. They have also been seen in mixed-species flocks. Despite their loud high-pitched calls, they are relatively shy birds that usually hide among the foliage of trees. They are especially noisy during breeding season. = Diet = These birds are insectivorous and are commonly found foraging forests for small insects. They can be seen foraging in small parties of up to 15 individuals during non- breeding seasons. They feed primarily on grasshoppers, crickets, locust, beetles, aphids, dipteran flies, bugs, moths and spiders. They may occasionally feed on small frogs, berries and other fruits.In John Gould's Birds of Asia = Breeding and Nesting = The breeding seasons of the long- tailed broadbill may vary according to location. Populations that live in the Indian Subcontinent breed from March to April, while populations residing in/near Myanmar begin breeding from April. The female will lay between 5 and 6 eggs, which are white and oval shaped. Both sexes incubate and feed the chicks. It is even suggested that Long-tailed broadbills may be cooperative breeders, since more than two individuals have been observed around the nest.Tellkamp, Markus Patricio. \\"Broadbills (Eurylaimidae).\\" Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia, edited by Michael Hutchins, et al., 2nd ed., vol. 10: Birds III, Gale, 2004, pp. 177-186. Gale eBooks, Accessed 14 Oct. 2019. They build a large pear-shaped nest that is attached to the branch of a tall tree. The nest has a small 1-2 inch circular entrance on the side of the structure, which is usually protected by a cushion of leaves. The nest is composed of fine roots, dead leaves, creepers, mosses and other stringy vegetable matter. Once the young chicks become independent juveniles, they often disperse and settle in new locations within the habitat range. = Vocalization = The long-tailed broadbill's call is a series of loud, sharp, downward-inflected whistles, ‚Äúpseeu..pseeu..pseeu‚Äù and ‚Äútseeay..tseeay‚Äù sounds on a descending scale. They may also make a sharp rasping ‚Äúpseeup‚Äù sound.  Conservation  According to the ICUN Red list of threatened species, the long-tailed broadbill is of least concern. They are fairly common throughout their range and are found in many national parks where they are protected throughout its range.

The Series 1 is the only car ever designed and engineered by Carroll Shelby from a clean sheet of paper, and built from the ground up. All other Shelbys are re-engineered models produced by other manufacturers and modified by Shelby. Prior to production of the Series 1, significant costs were incurred in testing and certification required to conform to 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Once completed, a total of 249 production Series 1 were constructed by Shelby American, Inc., all as 1999 models. During production, Venture Corporation purchased Shelby American, Inc. The purchase included the Series 1 model, but not the rights to produce the \\"Continuation Series\\" Shelby Cobrashttps://classiccobra.com. In 2004, after a subsequent bankruptcy by Venture Corporation, Carroll Shelby's new company, Shelby Automobiles, Inc., purchased the Series 1 assets for pennies on the dollar. Included in the asset purchase were enough components to produce several more complete Series 1s. Because the 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards certificate had expired, and the cost to re-certify the car was prohibitive, all Series 1's produced after that date were completed as \\"component cars\\" and delivered with no engine or transmission. Those \\"component car\\" models built in 2005 are identified with a seven digit vehicle identification number (VIN) and were designated with a CSX5000 series serial number. The original 249 were production cars with a seventeen digit VIN. A lot of the interior components came from General Motors, such as a Monsoon premium sound system, an A/M-F/M cassette player and CD player radio from Buick, an instrument cluster and climate controls from Pontiac, and a few other parts. After the bankruptcy of Venture Corporation, new investors approached Carroll Shelby with plans to build a Series II (a.k.a.: \\"Series 2\\"). The design was much like the Series I, but with restyled bumpers, headlamp assemblies, improved powertrain, more horsepower and other refinements. Three prototype Series II‚Äôs were built for introduction at the 2006 Concorso Italiano in Monterey, CA. They were introduced at a price of $225,000 for the production models. Orders with deposits were placed for a limited production run. All but a few production slots sold out in a relatively short time. After the prototypes were completed and before production began, more restrictive US DOT emission and safety standards became law, pushing the cost of Series II homologation well beyond what was originally anticipated. With the significant changes and additional testing required to meet new standards, the project ran out of money and was put on hold. Over $5,000,000 US was invested into the Series 2 project, but only the three Series II prototypes were built. Mark Logan, Shelby Cars NW, Dynamic Motorsports, 2016 Technical specifications Series 2 with a brushed aluminium body The Series 1 was produced in both supercharged and naturally aspirated versions. Supercharged cars were also outfitted by the factory with larger brakes and a heavy duty clutch. Performance is in the \\"supercar\\" category with a 0-60 time at 3.2 seconds. Nicely optioned, Series 1 had power steering, power disc brakes, factory air conditioning, Cruise Control, Traction Control, Stability control, power windows, and an AM/FM/CD audio system. The convertible top folded away out of sight in a compartment located behind the cockpit. Some component cars were sold as a roadster with no convertible top. The Series 1 had dual wishbone suspension with coil-over remote reservoir dampers mounted inboard, and actuated by \\"rocker arms\\". The engine was mounted completely behind the front axle and drove a drive shaft supported in a \\"torque tube\\" that spun a 6 speed ZF trans-axle specially modified for the Series 1. The chassis was made of extruded and formed 6061 aluminum. It was welded together and then post-heat-treated for maximum strength throughout. Then aluminum honeycomb panels specially designed were bonded into the floor boards and rocker panels for added structure and stiffness. The body panels were carbon fiber and fiberglass laminate. The engine, torque-tube, trans-axle, and damper mounts were all rubber-isolated from the frame. The supercharged prototypes produced near 600 bhp and of torque.

Designed by Walter Extra, it was introduced to the United States market in 1996. The Extra 200 is slightly smaller than the Extra 300, and is powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) rather than the Extra 300's 300 hp (224 kW) Lycoming engine making it a great choice for those on a restricted budget. It offers the flying characteristics of the EA-300, is capable of all unlimited maneuvers, and makes a great all-round training/sports aerobatic aircraft. Design The Extra 200 is based on the design of the Extra 300, and the two aircraft share many similarities. The Extra 200 has a welded steel (4130) tube fuselage covered in fiberglass and fabric with a carbon/glass hybrid composite empennage (i.e., the tail assembly, including the horizontal and vertical stabilizers, elevators, and rudder), and a bubble canopy. The monocoque wings have a carbon fiber composite spar with fiberglass skins and an integral fuel tank. A symmetrical airfoil, mounted with a zero angle of incidence, provides equal performance in both upright and inverted flight. The landing gear is fixed taildragger style with composite main legs and fiberglass wheel pants. The piston-engined powerplant is a fuel-injected Lycoming AEIO-360-A1E that produces 200 horsepower (149 kW), and it is equipped with a 3-bladed constant- speed MTV-12-B-C/C 183-17e propeller made of laminated wood encased in glass- fiber reinforced plastic.

It was released in November 1965, eight months after Jeff Beck replaced Eric Clapton on guitar. It includes songs with both guitarists and reflects the group's blues rock roots and their early experimentations with psychedelic and hard rock. The title refers to the driving \\"rave up\\" arrangement the band used in several of their songs. The album contains some of the earliest live recordings with Clapton. Recorded in March 1964, they appeared on the band's British debut album, Five Live Yardbirds, which was not issued in the United States. The songs with Beck were recorded in the studio in the months after he joined the group in March 1965. These include several charting singles and introduced \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", one of the Yardbirds' most copied arrangements. Although most were not written by the group, the songs became a fixture of the group's concert repertoire and continued to be performed after Jimmy Page replaced Beck. Next to their 1967 Greatest Hits collection, Having a Rave Up is the Yardbirds' highest-charting album in the US and remains their longest- lasting release. The album continues to be reissued, often with bonus material, such as the next single \\"Shapes of Things\\", demo recordings for their follow-up album, and \\"Stroll On\\", featuring dual lead guitar by Beck and Page, from the Blow-Up soundtrack. Several music critics have cited the album's influence, particularly on hard rock guitar. Background Singer and harmonica player Keith Relf, rhythm guitarist Chris Dreja, bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, drummer Jim McCarty, and lead guitarist Top Topham formed the Yardbirds near London in mid-1963. The group were a part of the early British rhythm and blues scene that produced bands such as the Rolling Stones, whom they replaced as the resident act at the Crawdaddy Club. Songs by American blues and rhythm and blues artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Bo Diddley made up the repertoire of the early British R&B; groups. The Yardbirds' set lists included \\"I Wish You Would\\", \\"Smokestack Lightning\\", \\"Who Do You Love?\\", \\"You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover\\", and \\"Too Much Monkey Business\\". Eric Clapton replaced Topham in October 1963 and by early 1964, the Yardbirds had expanded their following on the home counties club circuit. The group made several attempts at recording in the studio, but were unable to reproduce their live sound to their satisfaction. Manager Giorgio Gomelsky then arranged to have a March performance at London's Marquee Club recorded. A key element of the Yardbirds' live shows was an extended instrumental section during some songs. Clapton recalled, \\"While most other bands were playing three-minute songs, we were taking three-minute numbers and stretching them out to five or six minutes, during which time the audience would go crazy\\". Dubbed a \\"rave up\\", this musical arrangement usually came during the middle instrumental section, in which the band shifted the beat into double-time and built the instrumental improvisation to a climax. The rave up has roots in jazz and became a signature part of the Yardbirds' sound. Musicologist Michael Hicks describes it: Several songs recorded at the Marquee show use this arrangement and are included on the debut album, Five Live Yardbirds, which was released in the UK in December 1964. Although AllMusic critic Bruce Eder calls it \\"the best such [British rock] live record of the entire middle of the decade\\", it did not reach the charts and was not issued in the US. Four songs from the album made their first American appearance on Having a Rave Up. After their first two singles, \\"I Wish You Would\\" and \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\", had limited success, the Yardbirds were under pressure to deliver a hit record by their label, Columbia Records. Samwell-Smith interested the group in recording \\"For Your Love\\", a new pop rock-oriented song written by Graham Gouldman. Clapton expressed displeasure over departing from the group's blues roots, and he left the Yardbirds two days before the song was released on 5 March 1965. \\"For Your Love\\" became their first Top 10 hit in both the UK and the US. To replace Clapton, the group needed a lead guitarist who was experienced with blues and R&B;, but also willing to explore more progressive and experimental material. They approached Jimmy Page, but he was unwilling to give up his steady employment as one of London's most popular studio guitarists. Page recommended Jeff Beck, who was invited to an informal audition. Drummer McCarty recalled the tryout: \\"Not only could he play all the Eric stuff, but also a lot more ... There was the Les Paul thing, the rockabilly thing, the whole lot. His style was also kind of futuristic. We were impressed.\\" Beck was asked to join and played his first gig with the Yardbirds the same day \\"For Your Love\\" was released. Shortly thereafter, the Yardbirds began recording a successful string of forward-looking singles with Beck's pioneering hard rock and psychedelic guitar work. Their first American album, For Your Love, which included Beck's earliest recordings with the group and earlier singles and demos with Clapton, was rush-released in June 1965 as they were preparing for their first American tour. In November 1965, Having a Rave Up was released less than a month before the beginning of the Yardbirds' second tour of the US and also combined songs recorded with both Clapton and Beck. Composition and musical style With the exception of \\"Still I'm Sad\\", the songs on Having a Rave Up were not composed by the Yardbirds. Two of the album's hits, \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" and \\"Evil Hearted You\\", were written for the group by Gouldman, who had composed \\"For Your Love\\". Both songs saw the group continuing to move beyond their blues-rock beginnings with Beck's experimental guitar work. \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" is one of the earliest rock songs to incorporate Indian musical influences. Several months before the Beatles popularised the sound with \\"Norwegian Wood\\", demos for \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" were attempted with sitar accompaniment. However, the Indian sitar player had difficulty with the 4/4 metre and the instrument lacked the power the group desired. Instead, Beck produced a sitar-like effect by bending the higher notes on his guitar in an Eastern-sounding scale and using a Tone Bender distortion device to get a more distinctive tone. The minor key, pop- oriented \\"Evil Hearted You\\" also incorporates exotic-sounding elements. Rock critic Richie Unterberger notes the \\"haunting Middle Eastern-influenced melody ... typically eerie backup harmonies, [and] Keith Relf's menacing, hurt lead vocal\\". Beck provides a steel guitar-like slide solo, which biographer Martin Power describes as a \\"shimmering two-octave slide solo sounding almost ghostly\\". \\"You're a Better Man Than I\\" was written by Mike Hugg and his brother Brian. The song reflects the folk-rock style of the time with socially conscious lyrics. Relf's folk-ballad vocal is complemented by Beck's vibrato- and sustain-heavy guitar solo. \\"Still I'm Sad\\" is the album's sole original tune by the band, written by Samwell-Smith and McCarty. It is a slow, brooding piece with psychedelic pop elements. Built on a mock-Gregorian chant, the song has seven vocal parts with producer Gomelsky adding a droning bass vocal under Relf's melody. The balance of the songs are blues and R&B; numbers. Two versions of the Bo Diddley tune \\"I'm a Man\\" are on the album ‚Äì a live rendering with Clapton and a re-worked studio version with Beck. These two recordings illustrate differences between Clapton's and Beck's styles during their tenures with the Yardbirds. Clapton employs a more traditional sound with chording, whereas Beck takes a more novel approach, which Power describes: \\"[T]hings changed radically at one minute, 28 seconds into the song when Beck's foot smashed into his Tone Bender [and he] and Relf chased after each other in a manic harmonica/guitar interface, notes swooping in and out of the mix\\". Although just over two and a half minutes, critic Cub Koda calls the Beck version \\"perhaps the most famous Yardbirds rave-up of all\\" and Power asserts \\"it was the closest the group had yet come to capturing the sound of the 'rave-up' on tape\\". The remaining three live songs with Clapton feature extended instrumental improvisation. Bo Diddley's \\"Here 'Tis\\" and the Isley Brothers' \\"Respectable\\" are fast-tempo, rhythmic-based songs that are essentially rave ups. On \\"Here 'Tis\\", Clapton adds an uncharacteristically energetic rhythm guitar over Samwell-Smith's driving bass lines. In his autobiography, Clapton identifies Howlin' Wolf's \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" as the Yardbirds' most popular live number. They usually played it every night and performances of the song could last up to 30 minutes. On the 5:35 album version, Clapton trades guitar licks with Relf's harmonica lines. Howlin' Wolf reportedly referred to the group's \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" as \\"the definitive version of his song\\". The Yardbirds based their version of \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" on the 1956 rockabilly arrangement by Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio. However, their recording adds a brief rave up section, new guitar parts, and a harmonica solo. Beck biographer Annette Carson notes, \\"the Yardbirds' recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity and turned it into a classic among classics\\". Recording and production The recordings with Beck for Having a Rave Up took place at various studios between April and September 1965. Three were recorded during the Yardbirds' first American tour ‚Äì \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" and \\"You're a Better Man than I\\" were recorded 12 September 1965 by Sam Phillips at his Phillips Recording studio in Memphis, Tennessee, and \\"I'm a Man\\" (studio version) at the Chess Studios in Chicago by Ron Malo 19 September 1965. Further refinements to the three songs were recorded at the Columbia Recording Studio in New York City by Roy Halee 21 and 22 September 1965. Another three songs with Beck were recorded by Roger Cameron at Advision Studios in London ‚Äì \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" 20 April 1965, \\"Still I'm Sad\\" 17 August 1965 (also at Olympic Studios by Keith Grant 27 July 1965), and \\"Evil Hearted You\\" 23 August 1965. The four remaining live songs with Clapton were recorded in March 1964 at the Marquee Club in London ‚Äì \\"Smokestack Lightning\\", \\"Respectable\\", \\"I'm a Man\\", and \\"Here 'Tis\\". These were taken from the UK debut album Five Live Yardbirds. The album was produced by the Yardbirds' manager Gomelsky with Samwell-Smith. Clapton acknowledges that Samwell-Smith was behind the group's rave up sound and on \\"For Your Love\\", Samwell-Smith assumed the role of de facto producer. He received a credit as \\"Musical Director\\" for their first American album as well as Having a Rave Up. By the time Samwell-Smith left the group in June 1966, Koda notes, \\"he was shouldering most, if not all, of the production and arranging responsibilities\\". Release and charts Having a Rave Up was released in the US on 15 November 1965 by the Yardbirds' American label, Epic Records. The album cover photo shows the group posing in matching black suits in a mock performance; Yardbirds' biographer Adam Clayson compares it to \\"more of a tea dance than a rave-up\\". Clapton, who left the band eight months earlier, is not pictured on the album cover. The liner note reads like ad copy, with no mention of the band members or recording information. The album entered Billboard magazine's Top LPs chart in December 1965 at number 137 and reached number 53 in February 1966. In total, it spent 33 weeks in the chart. Having a Rave Up remained in print until 1972, longer than any other Yardbirds album on Epic. Having a Rave Up or an equivalent was not released in the UK, where it was the practice at the time not to include singles on albums. The live tracks with Clapton appeared on Five Live Yardbirds, which was issued on 4 December 1964. Between June and October 1965, \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", \\"Evil Hearted You\\", and \\"Still I'm Sad\\" were released as singles and reached the pop chart Top 10. In February 1966, \\"You're a Better Man than I\\" became the UK B-side of \\"Shapes of Things\\". \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" and \\"I'm a Man\\" (studio version) were not released in the UK until 1976 and 1977, well after the group had disbanded. In January 1966, the Yardbirds' UK label, Columbia, pressed Having a Rave Up for export to Germany and Sweden. In Canada, the album was issued by Capitol Records in 1966. Live and film performances Five songs from Having a Rave Up, plus the following two singles, made up the core of the Yardbirds' concert repertoire: \\"Smokestack Lightning\\", \\"I'm a Man\\", \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", \\"You're a Better Man Than I\\", \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", \\"Shapes of Things\\", and \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\". Numerous live performances were recorded beginning in mid-1965 and include these songs. They were also recorded by the BBC on various dates for broadcast. In 1991, several were released on Yardbirds ...On Air (reissued in 1997 as BBC Sessions). During one of many appearances on Ready Steady Go!, the UK pop music variety television programme, the Yardbirds performed an updated version of \\"Here 'Tis\\" with Beck. After Page joined the group in June 1966, film director Michelangelo Antonioni wanted to add a scene of the Yardbirds performing \\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" to his 1966 film Blowup. Relf wrote new lyrics and the group worked out a new instrumental arrangement with both Beck and Page on lead guitars, retitled \\"Stroll On\\". The performance is included in the film and on the Blow-Up soundtrack album. When Beck left the group in October 1966, Page became the sole guitarist. Although several new songs were added, set lists still included their earlier material. A 1968 live performance in New York City (released in 1971 as Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page) features the core songs, plus the Page solo piece \\"White Summer\\" and an early version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\". Page carried over these songs to Led Zeppelin and \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" became a medley, which developed into \\"How Many More Times\\". Dreja sums up the lasting appeal: \\"We all feel, I think, that the period Jeff spent with the band was the most creative. His scope of inventiveness was probably the widest of the three guitarists we played with‚Äîand none of them were exactly slouches.\\" Critical reception and influence Having a Rave Up was released before the advent of critical rock music journalism. A December 1965 staff review in Billboard indicated the album's potential to enter the Top LPs chart. Several retrospective reviews have been favourable. AllMusic's Eder gave the album four and a half out of five stars and describes it as \\"one of the best LPs of the entire British invasion, on a par with the greatest mid-1960s work of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones\\". Author Denise Sullivan noted, \\"Among British blues-rock albums, this Giorgio Gomelsky production is the pick for its wealth of hits and its influence on garage rock and hard rock lead guitar.\\" Clapton biographer David Bowling calls the album \\"early and important rock 'n' roll ... It remains an important step in the evolution of rock music.\\" A review in Guitar Player magazine included: Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album at number 355 on its list of the \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\". The accompanying review noted, \\"Freed from Eric Clapton's blues purism and spurred by Jeff Beck's reckless exhibitionism, the Yardbirds launched a noisy rock & roll avant-garde. This is the bridge between beat groups and psychedelia.\\" Ultimate Classic Rock identified the album as one of \\"The Top 100 '60s Rock Albums\\" in 2015. The accompanying listing statement focuses on the guitarists: \\"Half Eric Clapton (on the live blues part), half Jeff Beck (on the more experimental pop stuff), this is the two sides of the Yardbirds reaching for a common ground. Take your pick: The electricity surging through both guitarists powers a band that had songs and chops to spare.\\" Track listing =Original album= Songwriters and track running times are taken from the original American Epic LP.

Originally, there was to be one disc, but so many musicians wanted to be part of the sessions that over 160 minutes of music was recorded. At this point, the remaining members Warren Haynes and Matt Abts decided to split the project into two releases. The Deep End, Volume 1 was issued in 2001, and Vol 2 was generally the harder sounding of the two releases although it also featured country and jazz tracks as well.

Peel produced her debut album Ask Me No Questions. She also recorded a large number of BBC Radio and Peel sessions and toured regularly on the British college and festival circuit. St John appeared at leading folk venues in the UK, along with other folk and pop luminaries of the time such as Nick Drake, Paul Simon, and David Bowie, among others.Brumbaugh, Sam. \\"Bridget St John, Interview\\".

Cherry Red Records, 19 April 2009. She took piano lessons at her mother's behest, but she didn't get along with her teacher and quit when she was 11. After studying the viola for two years and then the trumpet for two years, St John bought a guitar with 20 pounds her grandmother gave her shortly before she finished high school. Her first performances were at Sheffield University in 1964‚Äì5, and her very first \\"proper gig\\" was at a pub in Rotherham. In 1967 St John spent 3 months in Aix- en-Provence as part of her French studies. During this period she met American singer-songwriter Robin Frederick. =Solo career, 1968‚Äì1974= When it was time to return to England, St John travelled back to London with Robin Frederick. It was through Frederick that St John met John Martyn when he was living in Richmond. He was instrumental in getting St John's music out to a larger audience. In 1968 a mutual poet friend of theirs, Pete Roche, put St John in touch with John Peel for his \\"Nightride\\" radio show. St John's first recording sessions for Peel were recorded by Al Stewart in 1968 on Stewart's ReVox. The four songs she recorded were released on John Peel Presents Top Gear, Peel's 1969 compilation of BBC demos. The four songs were: \\"The River\\" (written by Martyn), \\"Song To Keep You Company\\" (written by St John), \\"Night In The City\\" (written by Joni Mitchell), and \\"Lazarus\\" (traditional). Peel and Clive Selwood formed Dandelion initially to release St John's music. St John's 1969 debut album for Dandelion, Ask Me No Questions, was produced by Peel and recorded in nine to ten hours.Adams, Owen. \\"Label of love: Dandelion Records\\". The Guardian 7 October 2009. \\"Curl Your Toes\\" and \\"Ask Me No Questions\\" featured Martyn on second guitar. Richie Unterberger reviewing for Allmusic called the album \\"music for wandering through meadows on overcast days\\", while admitting that the songs are not as good as those of the musically similar Nick Drake. In 1970, St John recorded a vocal duet with Kevin Ayers on \\"The Oyster and the Flying Fish\\" for his Shooting at the Moon release. Her second album, Songs for the Gentle Man, was produced by Ron Geesin and released in 1971. This album was a significant step up from her debut, and contained string arrangements mostly by Geesin himself, particularly striking on the opening track \\"A Day A Way\\" and \\"Seagull- Sunday.\\" Her third album Thank You For..., released in 1972, was even more ambitious and used more musicians with a folk-rock sound. The album was her last album for John Peel's Dandelion label, however, which folded due to its artists' lack of commercial success. St John's adventurous fourth album Jumble Queen, released through Chrysalis Records in 1974, garnered critical praise in Spare Rib.Conboy, Martin & Steel, John, eds.

It was first published by Eug√®ne Demets in 1906. The third and fourth movements were subsequently orchestrated by Ravel, while the fifth was orchestrated by Percy Grainger, among others. Structure Miroirs has five movements, each dedicated to a member of Les Apaches: Orchestrated versions \\"Une barque sur l'oc√©an\\" and \\"Alborada del gracioso\\" were orchestrated by Ravel himself. \\"La vall√©e des cloches\\" has been orchestrated by Roberto Halffter for triple woodwind, four horns, timpani, percussion, two harps, celesta and strings; and Percy Grainger for a typical Grainger ensemble with multiple pianos and percussion, plus strings. \\"Oiseaux tristes\\" has been scored by Felix G√ºnther for double woodwind plus piccolo, two horns, two trumpets, percussion, harp, celesta and strings; though aimed at intermediate rather than advanced players, transposed down a semitone and with some of Ravel's rhythms simplified. The earliest known orchestration of \\"Noctuelles\\" is by the British pianist Michael Round, an orchestration commissioned by Vladimir Ashkenazy and recorded by him with the NHK Symphony Orchestra (Exxon, 1993) ‚Äì the recording also includes Round's scorings of the Fugue and Toccata from Le tombeau de Couperin. In orchestrated form \\"Noctuelles\\" is scored for triple woodwind (including E clarinet) minus one contrabassoon; four horns, three trumpets, three trombones and tuba, timpani, percussion, two harps, celesta and strings. There is a more recent orchestration (2001) of \\"Noctuelles\\" by American composer Steven Stucky. It is published by Theodore Presser Company and is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (3rd doubling English horn), 2 clarinets, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, 2 percussionists, celesta, two harps, and strings.

The movie follows the two sisters as they try various strategies to get their widower father, Max (Tom Amandes) (who is a talented artist and sculptor) a girlfriend. After their first attempts end in failure, Tess and Emily team up with their friend Cody to paint an advertisement on a giant billboard situated high above Sunset Boulevard. Many women answer the advertisement through letters and through random chance, Max answers a letter submitted by a woman named Debbie. Debbie brings along her friend Brooke as a back-up in preparation for the former's date with Max. Brooke and Max coincidentally meet and take a liking to each other and Debbie agrees they should start dating. At first, Tess and Emily don't like Brooke's son, Ryan, but when an elaborate scheme by Max's business manager, Nigel, to break up the romantic relationship between Max and Brooke arises, Ryan and the girls learn to put aside their differences in order to foil the break-up plan.

It was engineered and purpose built for auto racing, specifically to take on Ferrari and its 250 GTO in the GT class. The original project had six Shelby Daytona Coupes built for racing purposes between 1964 and 1965, as Carroll Shelby was reassigned to the Ford GT40 project to compete at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, again to beat Ferrari in the highest level prototype class. With the Shelby Daytona, Shelby became the first American constructor to win a title on the international scene in the FIA International Championship for GT Manufacturers in 1965. The Shelby Daytona has recently been chosen for historic preservation as a significant vehicle in the history of auto racing.

During this period, Shelby Daytona Coupes raced in GT Division III, for engine displacements over 2000 cc. They competed at numerous 500 km, 1000 km, 2000 km, 12 hour and 24 hour races on the International Championship for GT Manufacturers series, including events at Le Mans, Daytona, Sebring, Imola, Reims, Spa Francorchamps, Goodwood Circuit, Oulton Park, Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, the multi-race Tour de France Automobile, Enna, Rouen, Monza, and N√ºrburgring.

The Shelby Daytona Coupes won the GT III class (by 19 points) for the 1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers. A partial list of competitions and results includes: * 1964 12 Hours of Sebring (GT class win, fourth overall, Dave MacDonald/Bob Holbert) * 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans (GT class win, fourth overall, Dan Gurney/Bob Bondurant) * 1964 RAC Tourist Trophy (GT class win) * 1965 24 Hours of Daytona (GT class win) * 1965 12 Hours of Sebring (GT class win) * 1965 Italian Grand Prix at Monza (GT class win) * 1965 N√ºrburgring 1000 km (GT class win) * 1965 12 Hours of Reims (GT class win, clinched 1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers) * 1965 Enna-Pergusa (GT class win) * 1965 25 land speed records at Bonneville The Ferrari/Mulsanne problem Carroll Shelby, after winning Le Mans in 1959, wanted to return to Europe to beat Enzo Ferrari at Le Mans with a car of his own design. Having developed the AC Cobra/Shelby Cobra into a successful GT race car, he realised that the weakness of the open-cockpit sports cars at Le Mans was the aerodynamic drag which limited top speed on the long Mulsanne Straight to around , nearly less than the Ferrari 250 GTO, which itself could hold speeds of circa . Given the length of this straight, this speed differential represented a loss of over 10 seconds per lap which could negate any power and acceleration advantage that the Cobra had in the slower sections. Shelby asked employee Pete Brock to design the Daytona's aerodynamic bodywork and Bob Negstad to design the car's suspension. Negstad also designed the chassis and suspension for the GT40 and the CSX 3000 series Shelby Cobra, often referred to as the \\"coil-Spring Cobra\\" chassis. After sketching the proposed design on the floor of the Shelby America workshop, starting with the roadster chassis crashed at the 1963 Le Mans race, Brock removed the bodywork and placed a seat and steering wheel in alignment of where he felt that they should be. He then placed driver Ken Miles in the car, and using scrap wood and gaffer tape, designed the windscreen - the first component to be manufactured for the car. He then interspaced wooden formers and, using these as a guide, hand-made the aluminum bodywork for chassis #CSX2287 around them. Shelby conferred with an aerodynamics consultant from Convair who said that the design needed to be extended on the tail by at least , but Brock stood by his design. Miles took the car to the Riverside Raceway, and on the main straight, took the car on his first five laps to , admittedly after it had been found to have \\"almost flown, lightening the steering a great deal\\" at speeds above . It took another 30 days of development before Miles signed off the car, clocked at that point capable of speeds over . CSX2287 was transported to Daytona Speedway for its debut race in the February 16, 1964 Daytona Continental 2000 km. Driver Dave MacDonald earned the pole position with a time of 2:08.200 and average speed of 106.464 MPH. Chassis numbers The first Shelby Daytona Coupe was built at the Shelby American race shop in Venice, California. The remaining five were built at Carrozzeria Gransport (Italian for \\"Grand Sport Coachbuilders\\") in Modena, Italy. A seventh semi-related car, the 427 \\"Type 65\\" Shelby Daytona Super Coupe # CSB3054 prototype that was developed but never officially completed by Shelby, is not included in this article. = Chassis # CSX2286 = Owned and successfully vintage raced by S. Robson Walton, but crashed at Laguna Seca Raceway in August 2012. The car has since been repaired and fully restored. = Chassis # CSX2287 - The Original = Chassis #CSX2287 was the very first prototype Cobra Daytona Coupe, and is the only coupe that was built entirely at the Shelby American race shop in Venice, California. It has an extensive race history, competing at Daytona, Sebring, Reims, Spa Francorchamps, Oulton Park TT, Le Mans, Tour de France and Bonneville Salt Flats. It was driven by Dave MacDonald, Bob Holbert, Jo Schlesser, Phil Hill, Jochen Neerpasch, Chris Amon, Innes Ireland, Andr√© Simon, Maurice Dupeyron, Bob Johnson and Tom Payne. Chassis CSX2287 won the GT class at the 12 Hours of Sebring in March 1964 with MacDonald and Holbert behind the wheel. The race at Sebring marked the first victory for a Cobra Daytona Coupe. At Le Mans in June 1964, the car was finished in Viking Blue metallic very distinctive white painted front fenders. The drivers were Amon and Neerpasch. They led the GT class until the car was disqualified in the 10th hour for an illegal jump start due to battery and alternator failure. This coupe ended its racing career by setting 25 USAC/FIA world records at the Bonneville Salt Flats, Utah, in November 1965, while driven by Craig Breedlove, Bobby Tatroe and Tom Greatorex during a Goodyear tire testing session. Shortly thereafter, it was reconditioned and was advertised for sale. Slot car racing magnate, Jim Russell bought the car from Shelby in 1966 after seeing an ad in the newspaper, for about $4-$5k. Russell eventually listed the car for sale and music producer Phil Spector bought it from him. The car was not suited for street driving, however certain features were added including traditional rear-exit mufflers and interior carpeting, in order to make it more user- friendly. It is unknown if these were added by Spector or Russell. All trace of CSX2287 was lost by the mid-1970s, with car historians and collectors fearing the car had been destroyed. In 2001 the car was rediscovered in a rental storage unit in California. The owner Donna O'Hara had committed suicide by burning herself alive. The car had remained undiscovered for almost 30 years. Due to its estimated worth of over $4,000,000 the car was part of an extensive legal battle between her mother who sold the car to Dr. Frederick A. Simeone, and a friend of Ms O'Hara who was the recipient in her will of the contents of the storage unit. An earlier owner of the car appears to have been music producer Phil Spector who had been known to drive it on the streets of Los Angeles. Built for high-speed sprints, the cab became uncomfortably warm as the car engine heated up, among other problems. \\"It wasn't a street car; it was a race car\\", Shelby said. Still, Spector drove it on the streets, and legend is that Spector racked up so many speeding tickets, his lawyer advised him to get rid of the car before he lost his license. CSX2287 is restored. It has been preserved and mechanically reconditioned. It is part of the permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA. In January 2014 CSX2287 became the first vehicle added to the Historic Vehicle Association's National Historic Vehicle Register in the United States. Concurrently it became the first automobile to be recorded under the United States Secretary of the Interior Standards for Heritage Documentation, kept on file in the Library of Congress. In November 2014, CSX2287 won the International Historic Motoring Awards \\"Car of the Year\\", which is voted on by the public. In addition to being the first American car to win the award, the Cobra Daytona Coupe is also the first American car nominated for this award. = Chassis # CSX2299 = This was the second Coupe built and the first completed at Carrozzeria Gransport. It competed in nine FIA races (LeMans, Reims, Goodwood Tourist Trophy, Tour de France, Daytona, Sebring, Oulton Park TT, LeMans, Enna), won four FIA events (LeMans '64, Tourist Trophy '64, Daytona '65, Sebring '65) and one event during the Tour de France (Rouen). The car was driven through this period by Dan Gurney, Bob Bondurant, Maurice Trintignant, Bernard de St. Auban, Jo Schlesser, Hal Keck, Jack Sears and Dick Thompson. At LeMans in 1964, drivers Gurney and Bondurant, clocking over on the Mulsanne Straight, took First Place in the GT III Class. CSX2299 was painted Viking Blue with two white stripes in 1964 and repainted Guardsman Blue with two larger longitudinal white stripes and a transverse white stripe across the nose in 1965. In 1964 this car set lap records at Le Mans, Reims and Rouen and the race distance record at Le Mans and Goodwood. In 1965 the car set the lap record at Oulton Park. CSX2299 was the last Daytona coupe sold by Shelby with a Bill of Sale which read \\"the number one Cobra Daytona coupe\\". It is currently owned by Larry H. Miller Group and is displayed at the Shelby American Collection in Boulder, Colorado. = Chassis # CSX2300 = This Shelby Daytona Coupe was leased from Alan Mann Racing by Ford of France, to race as the national \\"Tri-Colore\\" entry in the 1965 Nurburgring 1000 km race, for which it was painted a white body finish with blue and red stripes. Well known French drivers Andr√© Simon and Jo Schlesser drove this coupe to 3rd in the GT 3 category (behind the GT winning Alan Mann entry driven by Bondurant and Neerpasch), and 12th overall. After the race, this white coupe was returned to Alan Mann Racing and was repainted in the official Guardsman Blue metallic and white stripe of the 1965 Shelby American team. Carroll Shelby himself owned this Daytona before it was sold by RM Auctions for $4.4 million on August 19, 2000. = Chassis # CSX2601 = This was the fourth Coupe built and the third completed at Carrozzeria Gransport. It competed in eight FIA races in 1965 (Daytona, Sebring, Monza, Spa, N√ºrburgring, LeMans, Reims, Enna), won four times in GT III class (Monza, N√ºrburgring, Reims, Enna), and driven by Bob Johnson, Tom Payne, Bob Bondurant, Allen Grant, Jochen Neerpasch and Jo Schlesser. At Reims, 3‚Äì4 July 1965, drivers were Bondurant and Schlesser. It was painted Guardsman Blue. They won the GT III Class, while also earning the points needed to secure the 1965 International Championship for GT Manufacturers. This car was featured in the 1965 film Red Line 7000, then was purchased by its driver Bob Bondurant, who sold it in 1969. The car sold for $7.25 million on August 15, 2009, and it is currently owned by Perez Companc family from Argentina. = Chassis # CSX2602 = This was the fifth Shelby Coupe built and the fourth completed at Carrozzeria Gransport. It competed in six 1965 races (Daytona, Sebring, Monza, Spa, N√ºrburgring and LeMans) and was driven by Rick Muther, John Timanus, Lew Spencer, Jim Adams, Phil Hill, Jack Sears, John Whitmore, Peter Sutcliffe and Peter Harper. Prior to the Le Mans race, chassis CSX 2602 was also raced at Daytona (driven by Muther and Timanus) in 1965, Sebring (driven by Spencer, Adams, and Hill) in 1965, Monza (driven by Sears and Whitmore) in 1965, and Nurburgring (driven by Sears and Gardner) also in 1965. Racing with the #59 at Le Mans on June 19‚Äì20, 1965, British drivers Sutcliffe and Harper ran CSX2602 with the distinctive Red & White Swiss colors for the famous Swiss racing team \\"Scuderia Filipinetti\\". The latter had already earned a reputation for themselves racing Ferraris. When Ford used up their allotment of entries for the 1965 Le Mans race, they asked team owner Georges Filipinetti to buy a Shelby Coupe from Alan Mann Racing and race it as his own annual entry. The red and white Cobra ran until the 10th hour, when a blown engine put it out of the race. After Le Mans, chassis CSX2602 was returned to Alan Mann Racing. It was repainted in the Shelby American team colors and never raced again. Continuation model In July 2015 Shelby American announced that they would produce a limited run of 50 continuation Daytonas to honor the 50th anniversary of the Daytona's win in the International Championship for GT Manufacturers. Some of the 50 are to be aluminum-bodied, while others will have cheaper fiberglass bodies. Ford Shelby GR-1 In 2004 Ford and Shelby created a sports coupe dubbed the Ford Shelby GR-1, with a sleek body and the new V10 powering the new Shelby Cobra. Carroll Shelby has explained that he does not want it to be called a Cobra, but it does bear resemblance to the Daytona.

It is the administrative center of Rivne Oblast (province), as well as the surrounding Rivne Raion (district) within the oblast. Administratively, Rivne is incorporated as a city of oblast significance and does not belong to the raion. Population: Between World War I and World War II, the city was located in Poland as a district-level (county) seat in Wolyn Voivodeship. At the start of the World War II in 1939, Rivne was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and received its current status by becoming a seat of regional government of Rivne Oblast which was created out of the eastern portion of the voivodeship. During the German occupation in 1941‚Äì44 the city was designated as a capital of the German Ukraine (Reichskommissariat Ukraine). In the spring of 1919, it also served as a provisional seat of the Ukrainian government throughout the ongoing war with the Soviet Russia. Rivne is an important transportation hub, with the international Rivne Airport, and rail links to Zdolbuniv, Sarny, and Kovel, as well as highways linking it with Brest, Kyiv and Lviv. Among other leading companies there is a chemical factory of Rivne-Azot (part of Ostchem Holding). History Rivne was first mentioned in 1283 in Polish annals \\"Rocznik kapitu≈Çy krakowskiej\\"Bovhyria, A. Rivne (–†–Ü–í–ù–ï). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine.History of Rivne (–Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è –†—ñ–≤–Ω–µ). Ukraine-in portal. as one of the inhabited places of Halych-Volhynia near which Leszek II the Black was victorious over an army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Following the partition of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia after Galicia-Volhynia Wars, it was under the rule of Great Duchy of Lithuania and in 1434 the Grand Duke of Lithuania ≈†vitrigaila awarded the settlement to a Lutsk nobleman Dychko. In 1461 Dychko sold his settlement to Prince Semen Nesvizh. In 1479 Semen Nesvizh died and his settlement was passed to his wife Maria who started to call herself princess of Rovno. She turned the settlement into a princely residence by building in 1481 a castle on one of local river islands and managed to obtain Magdeburg rights for the settlement in 1492 from the King of Poland Casimir IV Jagiellon. Following her death in 1518, the city was passed on to the princes of Ostrog and declined by losing its status as a princely residency. In 1566 the town of Rovno became part of newly established Volhynian Voivodeship. Following the Union of Lublin in 1569, it was transferred from the realm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Crown of Poland. The city had a status of privately held by nobles (Ostrogski and Lubomirski families). Following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 Rivne became a part of the Russian Empire, and in 1797 it was declared to be a county level (uyezd) town of the Volhynian Governorate. During World War I and the period of chaos shortly after, it was briefly under German, Ukrainian, Bolshevik, and Polish rule. In April‚ÄìMay 1919 Rivne served as the temporary capital of Ukrainian People's Republic. In late April 1919 one of the Ukrainian military leaders Volodymyr Oskilko attempted to organize a coup-d'√©tat against the Petliura's-led Directory and cabinet of Borys Martos and replace them with Yevhen Petrushevych as a president of Ukraine. In Rivne, Oskilko managed to arrest most of ministers from the cabinet including Martos himself, but Petliura at that time was in neighbouring Zdolbuniv and managed to stop Oskilko's efforts. At the conclusion of the conflict, in accordance with the Riga Peace Treaty of 1921 it became a part of Polish Volhynian Voivodeship, a situation which would last until the Second World War. In 1939, as a result of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the partition of Poland, Rivne was occupied by the Soviet Union. From December of the same year Rivne became the centre of the newly established Rivne Oblast, within the Ukrainian SSR. On June 28, 1941 Rivne was invaded by the 6th army of Nazi Germany, which later established the city as the administrative centre of Reichskommissariat Ukraine on August 20, 1941. A prison for the Gestapo was created in Belaia Street. At the time, roughly half of Rivne's inhabitants were Jewish; of these, about 23,000 were taken to a pine grove in Sosenki and killed between November 6 and 8. At the same period the well known German actor Olaf Bach was flown over to the city to perform for the German forces, for morale and to support the troops. He remained in Rivne from November 8 to the 13th. A ghetto was established for the remaining 5,000 Jews. In July 1942, its population was sent north to Kostopil where they were killed; the ghetto was subsequently liquidated. In 1992, a memorial complex of 20 thousand square meters was established, integrating the mass grave with an obelisk inscribed in Yiddish, Hebrew and Ukrainian to commemorate the killing of 17,500 Jews there in November 1941 during the Holocaust. On June 6, 2012, the World War II Jewish burial site was vandalized, allegedly as part of an anti-Semitic act. On February 2, 1944, the city was captured by the Red Army in the Battle of Rovno, and remained under Soviet control until Ukraine regained its independence on the break-up of the USSR in 1991. In 1958, the TV tower began broadcasting in the city; in 1969, the first trolley ran through the city; in 1969, Rivne airport was opened. In 1983, the city celebrated its 700th anniversary.

The average annual precipitation is June and July being the wettest months and January and February the driest. Industry During Soviet times the provincial town was transformed into an industrial center of the republic. There were two significant factories built. The first a machine building and metal processing factory capable of producing high-voltage apparatus, tractor spare parts and others. The other a chemical factory and synthetic materials fabrication plant. Light industry, including a linen plant and a textile mill, as well as food industries, including milk and meat processing plants and a vegetable preservation plant have also been built. In addition the city became a production center for furniture and other building materials. Attractions Cathedral of the Intercession As an important cultural centre, Rivne hosts a humanities and a hydro-engineering university, as well as a faculty of the Kyiv State Institute of Culture, and medical and musical as well as automobile-construction, commercial, textile, agricultural and cooperative polytechnic colleges. The city has a historical museum. Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the monument for the Soviet hero D.N.Medvedev was removed, and the N.I.Kuznetsov monument was moved to another location within the city. Instead, in order to reflect the controversial history of the region the monuments for \\"People who died in the honour of Ukraine\\", and \\"Soldiers who died in local military battles\\" were installed. =Buildings= *Church of the Assumption (1756) *Cathedral of the Intercession (2001) *Cathedral of the Ascension (1890) *A classicism-style gymnasium building (1839) *During Soviet times the centre of the city from Lenin street to Peace Avenue (1963 architects R.D.

History  = Early history = Cherkasy Castle The history of Cherkasy has not been thoroughly explored. The year of establishment is considered to be 1286 on the Kyivan Rus territory. There are few facts about the beginning of the city, but it is documented that Cherkasy existed in the 14th century. The first record about Cherkasy dates from 1305 in the Gustynskiy Chronicle, which is the Kyivan Rus chronicle. The city is mentioned as an existing city among other Kyivan Rus cities, including Kyiv, Kaniv, Zhytomyr and Ovruch. The city became one of the centers of the Cossack movement. Citizens took part in the Khmelnychchyna of 1648-1657 and in the Koliyivschyna of 1768‚Äì1769. The city was influenced by the cruel social and economical experiments of Soviet authorities and by World War II. In 1954 Cherkasy became the administrative center of Cherkasy Oblast (province), the youngest oblast of Ukraine. = Under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania = Dmytro Baida-Vyshnevetskiy, Cherkasy headman Ostafiy Dashkevich, Cherkasy headman In the 1360s the city entered a new period in its development, becoming a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Cherkasy became an important defender of the southern borders of the Grand Duchy. In 1384 the city was recognized as a fortified town on the southern edge (of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania), forming along with Vinnytsia, Bratslav and Kaniv part of a defensive line against Crimean Tatars. The city started to be ruled by a headman (starosta). From the end of the 15th until the beginning of the 16th centuries, the post of was held by the prominent persons of that time ‚Äì (in office: 1488-1495), (in office: 1494-1500), Vasyl Dashkevych (, in office: 1504-1507), Andriy Nemyrovych (in office: 1511-1514), Ostafiy Dashkevych (in office: 1514-1535), Vasyl Tyshkevych, Dmytro Baida-Vyshnevetskiy (in office: 1550-1553) etc. During the 15th and 16th centuries Cherkasy was one of the main centers that helped the Cossacks in the peopling of the Ukrainian south. Citizens took part in military campaigns against Tatars and Turks, including operations led by Ivan Pidkova (died 1578). New Cherkasy Castle, built in 1549‚Äì52 on the place of the old one, was the center of city life. = Under Polish rule, Khmelnytsky Uprising = Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky After the Union of Lublin in 1569 Cherkasy became a part of Poland. Cherkasy Regiment, which was created in 1625, played a big role in history of the city. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising the regiment became administrative-territorial subdivision (until 1686). During that time Cherkasy's Regiment was one of the most powerful military units and took part in all of the battles for Bohdan Khmelnytsky army. After a successful campaign, Khmelnytsky in 1654 signed an alliance with Muscovy at Pereyaslav. The war ended in 1667 with the Truce of Andrusovo. Cherkasy remained part of Poland, but territories east of the Dnieper River including left-bank Ukraine and Zaporizhia were secured for Muscovy. While in the Polish Kingdom the city was a seat of the county (poviat) which belonged to a greater unit ‚Äì the Kyiv Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province until 1793. In 1768 during the Koliyivshchyna turmoils the city was severely damaged and pillaged. In 1791 the city gained Magdeburg rights. It was a royal city of Poland. After the Second Partition of Poland the city was incorporated into the Kyivan Guberniya of Imperial Russia. = 19th ‚Äì early 20th centuries = City plan as of 1826 Since the beginning of the 19th century the city was planned by Russian architect, civil engineer and town planner of Scottish descent, William Heste. After the second division of Poland in 1793, Cherkasy became part of the Russian Empire. From 1797 it was a town of Kyiv Governorate. In the second half of the 19th century the city experienced a great economical growth. After the railroad appeared in the city, a lot of new industrial enterprises were built. Sugar, tobacco, metalwork, mechanical engineering and trade industries were at peak development at that time. Architect William Heste made a general development plan for the city, which involved building square blocks with straight streets. = 20th century (Soviet era) = After the October revolution in 1917 Cherkasy fell under Bolshevik control. After that, however, the city changed its ruler at least 18 times ‚Äì during the civil war it was conquered by hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, then again by Bolsheviks, later by Nikifor Grigoriev. On 1 January 1920, the city finally and for a long period fell under Soviet rule. As with all villages and towns in the area, it was a victim of man-made famine in 1932‚Äì1933 (Holodomor) and a Great Purge (a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union organised by Joseph Stalin in 1936‚Äì1938).Monument to Holodomor victims Memorial to the Warriors of the 254th Infantry Division, Liberators of Cherkasy The Second World War damaged the city greatly. On 22 June 1941, German bombers attacked Cherkasy. For two months soldiers defended the city, but on 22 August, the invaders took the city. On 14 December 1943, Cherkasy was set free from German invaders. After the end of the war, the city began to recover after being almost destroyed. According to 5-year plans, the city began to re-develop its economy, infrastructure and socio-cultural sphere. In 1954 the city became the administrative center of Cherkasy Oblast (province), the youngest among other oblasts in Ukraine. In the 1960s Cherkasy became the chemical giant of the Ukrainian SSR, after \\"Azot\\" (the biggest nitrogen fertilizer producing plant), \\"Himvolokno\\" (artificial fiber manufacturing plant), \\"Himreaktyv\\" (chemical reagents for military purposes) and many others were built in the city. In 1961 a Kremenchuk hydro power plant was built, forming the Kremenchuk Water Reservoir, which Cherkasy is now standing on. This makes the city a big transport hub, serving the longest dyke in Ukraine (15 km) with rail and road on it. = Independence from the Soviet Union = Since gaining independence, industry in the city has declined, along with the number of citizens and living standards. A lot of big and powerful factories and plants were privatized but couldn't survive in a competitive market. Some enterprises changed their profile ‚Äì several (3) factories and plants around the city were united under the \\"Bogdan Corporation\\" and started production of buses and cars. Some of the companies remained working and became successful, like \\"Azot\\". On 28 November 2008, the monument of Lenin was removed from the central square. This caused different reactions in different people. Now the central square, formerly called \\"Lenin Square\\", is called \\"Soborna Square\\" (Cathedral Square). The square was recently renovated. In 2009, Cherkasy airport received International Airport status (IATA: CKC ‚Äì ICAO: UKKE).  Transportation  = Public transportation = Public transportation is represented by trolleybuses and buses. Trolleybuses started serving the city in 1965, and now are operating on 10 routes, from approximately 6 am till 11 pm. The fleet is old, and mostly consists of ZiU-9 and ZiU-10 vehicles. Recently, 3 new trolleybuses (manufactured by LAZ) appeared in the city. Buses are mostly represented with \\"Etalon\\", \\"Bohdan\\", and \\"PAZ\\" buses. Cherkasy City Bus is the authority that controls the buses in the city, it consists of several private contractors which actually operate the transport system.

Two major automobile routes go through the city - H16 (Uman-Zolotonosha, national route) and P10 (Kaniv- Kremenchuk, regional route). There is a 4-lane highway between Cherkasy and Smila (which is a part of Cherkasy Urban Agglomeration).

Her story is told in the book Pandora, one of two novels in the New Tales of the Vampires series. Plot summary Pandora was born with the name Lydia in the Roman Republic in the year 15 BC to a Senatorial family. She is tall, with rippling brown hair and gold-brown eyes. Like many Patrician Roman females of the time Pandora was taught how to read and write and is well versed in epic poems, especially Ovid's works. She meets Marius for the first time when he is twenty-five and she is ten. Marius asks for Lydia's hand in marriage, but her father rejects Marius' offer. Five years later, Lydia sees Marius at a festival and begs her father to allow her to marry Marius. Her father again refuses. Pandora's father holds a high rank as a Senator. But when a new emperor takes power, her family is betrayed by her own brother and killed. Only Pandora and her traitorous brother survive the massacre, and she is taken to Antioch (after changing her name) by a man who was very close to her father. There she meets Marius again, twenty years after their last encounter. Unbeknownst to her, Marius is now a vampire. She eventually finds out what Marius has become, and also that he protects and hides the Queen and King of all Vampires. Another vampire, Akabar, wants to steal the Queen's powerful and ancient blood. Marius and Pandora try to prevent him from carrying out his plan. To gain access to the Queen, Akabar uses Marius's love for Pandora against him and drains Pandora to the point of death. In order to save her, Marius is forced to make Pandora into a vampire and forced to let Akabar see the Queen, who then destroys Akabar. The pair stay together for the next two hundred years, taking care of the King and Queen of all vampires, before arguing and separating. Marius later characterized the breakup (of which he left her and she spent six months or more waiting for him to return) as being entirely his fault: He considers himself a teacher who longs to impart what he knows upon his pupils, but Pandora‚Äîbeing as free-spirited and highly educated as she was‚Äîhad no patience to be his student. During their time together, against his objection, she did turn one of her beloved slaves into a vampire. As soon as he was turned he left the pair and was not seen again. The next time they meet again is in a Dresden ballroom in the early to late-17th century. Marius tries in vain to make Pandora leave her companion and fledgling, Arjun, and come back to him. Pandora's relationship with Arjun is of great concern to Marius, who fears Pandora is being held against her will. While she outwardly denies this, Pandora overcomes her embarrassment and admits to David in her writing that she could not bring herself to leave Arjun, citing that his stronger will propelled them both through time. The next and last time that they meet is in 1985, when she is among thirteen vampires who survived Akasha's killing spree and gathered at Maharet's house in the Sonoma compound to battle against Akasha. Pandora remains quiet and withdrawn throughout the whole ordeal, staring out the windows and saying little, rousing herself only once to say that Akasha is trying to justify deplorable \\"reasons\\" for a holocaust. Like many vampires, Pandora is a morose, despairing immortal who initially wanted immortality but soon regretted her choice and turns into a dark, indifferent cynic. Lestat thinks that Pandora was troubled in some deep, fundamental way even before she became a vampire, because she's the only vampire who doesn't receive visions of Maharet and Mekare in her dreams. During the confrontation in Sonoma, when Akasha directly asks Pandora to join with her or die, Pandora merely responds in a quiet, indifferent voice that she can't do what Akasha is asking of her, and stoically accepts the idea of being killed. Even after Akasha herself is destroyed and the thirteen vampires regroup in Armand's Night Island in Florida, Pandora still acts withdrawn from her fellow vampire kin, watching music videos all day long and completely ignoring Marius, who dotes on her lovingly. There is no sense of recovery or security in her as there is with the other vampires, and she departs from Night Island alone, still just as morose as ever. Other novels David Talbot encounters her in Paris shortly after the events of Memnoch the Devil and before the story of The Vampire Armand. He asks her to write the story of her life, which she does in a cafe by writing in some notebooks he gave her. She recalls the details of her life before becoming a vampire and briefly discusses the period when she was with Marius. After she has finished, she writes that she plans to go to New Orleans to look for Marius and to look into the eyes of Lestat, and try to understand what it is he saw. She is last seen at the end of Blood and Gold, alongside Marius. Pandora is again seen in the novel Prince Lestat when she comes to confront Arjun of his burning fledglings and old ones in Mumbai after being told by \\"The Voice\\". There she meets Gremt Stryker Knollys, who confides in her that he is also searching for \\"The Voice\\". He also claims to be the founder of the Talamasca in the year 748, along with the vampire who created Marius and the ghost of a vampire that was just killed named Hesketh. Gremt is the spirit Pandora meets towards the end of her novel when the writer Cassiodorus dies.

History The first structure at the site was a 2-mile-long wooden toll span with a draw bridge inaugurated in 1928. It was located just north of the current span, crossing from Orangedale to the present Shands pier on the west side of the river. The current bridge was dedicated on October 30, 1963, and features concrete beam-type construction for a total of two lanes. Until the building of the I-295 Buckman Bridge it was the only crossing of the St. Johns River between Jacksonville and Palatka. On October 7, 2016 the eastern approach to the bridge was eroded by Hurricane Matthew, so the bridge was closed to traffic for an indefinite time period. On October 9, the bridge reopened. In 2004, proposals were made to replace or upgrade the span. Problems cited include increasing traffic in the Clay County and St. Johns County areas, safety, and the inability of large boats to travel upriver. One plan proposed a new bridge north of the existing one, connecting to extensions of SR 9B and SR 23. Eventually a planned span just to the south was selected. In the fall of 2005, the railings of the bridge were upgraded to solid concrete barriers in an effort to reduce over- bridge fatalities. First Coast Expressway Replacement The third and final segment of the First Coast Expressway (also known as SR 23, which will connect I-10 and I-95 as a partial outer beltway around Jacksonville and Orange Park) includes a new four-lane bridge over the St. Johns River just south of where the Shands Bridge currently stands, as well as construction of new roadway connecting to I-95 in St. Johns County. Right-of-way acquisition, design and permitting for this $763 million segment is expected to be completed in 2020, with construction beginning in 2023. The current bridge will be partially or fully removed. The vertical clearance height of the new bridge will be 65 feet from the water line, compared to the existing 45 feet of clearance. The additional 20 feet will match the Buckman Bridge's clearance and is an improvement for marine commerce in the region.

These measures exhibit alt=Ma m√®re l'Oye (Mother Goose; \\"Oye\\" is correctly capitalized, being a proper name) is a suite by French composer Maurice Ravel. The piece was originally written as a five- movement piano duet in 1910. In 1911, Ravel orchestrated the work. Piano versions Ravel originally wrote Ma m√®re l'Oye as a piano duet for the Godebski children, Mimi and Jean, ages 6 and 7. Ravel dedicated this work for four hands to the children (just as he had dedicated an earlier work, Sonatine, to their parents). Jeanne Leleu and Genevi√®ve Durony premiered the work at the first concert of the Soci√©t√© musicale ind√©pendante on 20 April 1910. The piece was transcribed for solo piano by Ravel's friend Jacques Charlot the same year as it was published (1910); the first movement of Ravel's Le tombeau de Couperin was also dedicated to Charlot's memory after his death in World War I. Both piano versions bear the subtitle \\"cinq pi√®ces enfantines\\" (five children's pieces).

Beauty and the Beast is based upon the version by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont. The origin of The Fairy Garden is not entirely known, although the ballet version interprets this as Sleeping Beauty being awakened in the garden by her prince. On several of the scores, Ravel included quotes to indicate clearly what he is trying to invoke. For example, for the second piece, he writes: Orchestrated version In 1911, Ravel orchestrated the five-piece suite. This form is the most frequently heard today. Later the same year, he also expanded it into a ballet, separating the five initial pieces with four new interludes and adding two movements at the start, Pr√©lude and Danse du rouet et sc√®ne.

He is also Honorary Member of the Russian Academy of Creative Endeavors. For his contributions to particle and solid state physics he was awarded the Max Born Prize 2008 with Medal. His contribution to the memorial volume celebrating the 100th birthday of Lev Davidovich Landau earned him the Majorana Prize 2008 with Medal. He is married to Dr. Annemarie Kleinert since 1974 with whom he has a son Michael Kleinert. Publications Kleinert has written ~420 papers on mathematical physics and the physics of elementary particles, nuclei, solid state systems, liquid crystals, biomembranes, microemulsions, polymers, and the theory of financial markets.His Papers. He has written several books on theoretical physics,His books. the most notable of which, Path Integrals in Quantum Mechanics, Statistics, Polymer Physics, and Financial Markets, has been published in five editions since 1990 and has received enthusiastic reviews. Education He studied physics at the Leibniz University Hannover between 1960 and 1963, and at several American universities including Georgia Institute of Technology, where he learned general relativity as a graduate student from George Gamow, one of the fathers of the Big Bang theory. Kleinert earned his doctorate in 1967 at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Career As a young professor in 1972, Kleinert visited Caltech and was impressed by noted US physicist Richard Feynman. Later, Kleinert was to collaborate with Feynman in some of the latter's last work. This collaboration led to a mathematical method for converting divergent weak-coupling power series into convergent strong- coupling ones. This so-called variational perturbation theory yields at present the most accurate theory of critical exponents Kleinert, H., \\"Critical exponents from seven-loop strong-coupling œÜ4 theory in three dimensions\\". Physical Review D 60, 085001 (1999) observable close to second-order phase transitions, as confirmed for superfluid helium in satellite experiments. He also discovered an alternative to Feynman's time-sliced path integral construction which can be used to solve the path integral formulations of the hydrogen atom and the centrifugal barrier, i.e. to calculate their energy levels and eigenstates, as special cases of a general strategy for treating systems with singular potentials using path integrals. Within the quantum field theories of quarks he found the origin of the algebra of Regge residues conjectured by N. Cabibbo, L. Horwitz, and Y. Ne'eman (see p. 232 in reference ). Discoveries For superconductors he predicted in 1982 a tricritical point in the phase diagram between type-I and type-II superconductors where the order of the transition changes from second to first. The predictions were confirmed in 2002 by Monte Carlo computer simulations. The theory is based on a disorder field theory dual to the order field theory of L.D. Landau for phase transitions which Kleinert developed in the books on Gauge Fields in Condensed Matter. In this theory, the statistical properties of fluctuating vortex or defect lines are described as elementary excitations with the help of fields, whose Feynman diagrams are the pictures of the lines. At the 1978 summer school in Erice he proposed the existence of broken supersymmetry in atomic nuclei, which has since been observed experimentally. His theory of collective quantum fields and the Hadronization of Quark Theories are prototypes for numerous developments in the theory of condensed matter, nuclear and elementary particle physics. Together with K. Maki he proposed and clarified in 1981 a possible icosahedral phase of quasicrystals. This structure was discovered three years later in aluminum transition metal alloys by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize 2011. In 2006, he considered the existence of a novel Riemann particle. The experimental verification is still missing. See historical notes. String theory contributions In 1986 he introduced stiffness into the theory of strings, which had formerly been characterized by tension alone. This greatly improved the description of the physical properties of strings. The Russian physicist A. Polyakov simultaneously proposed a similar extension, and so the model is now known as the Polyakov-Kleinert string. Theory of distributions Together with A. Chervyakov, Kleinert developed an extension of the theory of distributions from linear spaces to semigroups by defining their products uniquely (in the mathematical theory, only linear combinations are defined). The extension is motivated by the physical requirement that the corresponding path integrals must be invariant under coordinate transformations, which is necessary for the equivalence of the path integral formulation to Schr√∂dinger theory. String theory alternative As an alternative to string theory, Kleinert used the complete analogy between non-Euclidean geometry and the geometry of crystals with defects to construct a model of the universe called the World Crystal or Planck-Kleinert crystal. In this model, matter creates defects in spacetime which generate curvature. This curvature reproduces all the effects of general relativity, but leads to different physics than string theory at the scale of the Planck length. This theory inspired Italian artist Laura Pesce to create glass sculptures entitled \\"world crystal\\" (see also lower left on this page). Current work Kleinert is a senior member of the faculty for the International Relativistic Astrophysics Ph.D. (IRAP) Project, which forms part of the international network for astrophysics (ICRANet). He was also involved in the European Science Foundation's project Cosmology in the Laboratory. Kleinert's 60th birthday was honored by a Festschrift and a Festcolloquium with 65 contributions by international colleagues (for instance Y. Ne'eman, R. Jackiw, H. Fritzsch, R. Ruffini, C.

In the 19th century the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time - in a similar manner to the way in which people compiled an encyclopedia. The chosen time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure resembled that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series produced by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of \\"academic history\\" its own historicity, or \\"cubbyhole in time\\", challenged by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th century there weren't any more new academic histories. Historians no longer subdivided their subject-matter in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the academic-history projects mentioned above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. Some new global histories resemble the academic histories, in that they are large and done by many people using a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.

Malone took on the bankers who wanted to call in their loans, and effectively saved the company from bankruptcy. Magness made Malone CEO but remained as chairman. By 1981, Malone had made TCI the largest cable company in the United States.Retrieved on 2009-03-12.Retrieved on 2009-04-02. In 1982, Malone hired Peter Barton, who called himself the company's \\"Jimmy Olsen\\" because he just did whatever was needed, fresh from Harvard Business School. Barton went on to become president of TCI's Cable Value Network (later QVC) in 1986, and in 1991, president of TCI spinoff Liberty Media. Barton had a playful side and even kept toys in his Liberty Media office, and a gorilla costume to represent his status as \\"second banana\\" to Malone. Yet he had a reputation as \\"a shrewd and sometimes vicious negotiator\\".Retrieved on 2009-04-02. =First Merger = In May 1991 United Artists announced a merger deal with their largest shareholder TCI ( Liberty Media) to form the largest cable operator in the US, a deal valued at $142.5m for the 50% not already owned by TCI. TCI and US West announced a joint venture, and in 1992 the joint venture company became Telewest Communications. By June the deal was approved. A week later on June 8 the deal was finalized with TCI acquiring the remaining 46% of United Artists, to allow full control. =Flextech= During the autumn of 1993 talks were also held with Flextech (a British television programming provider). Under the original terms of the proposed deal, Flextech would acquire TCI's European programming business in exchange for shares. By January the deal was complete with TCI acquired 40-60% of Flextech while Flextech acquired 100% of UK Bravo, 25% of UK Gold, and 31% of UK Living and 25% of the Children's Channel which increased its share in that channel. =Mile High Cablevision= In Spring of 1995 TCI Purchased Mile-Hi Cablevision, the CATV Provider for the city of Denver, Colorado & the city of Glendale, Colorado Mile-Hi Cablevision had been in business since 1983. And prior to the merger, TCI Served only the suburbs around the city & county of Denver. =Merger with Liberty Media = In Spring 1993, Bell Atlantic began looking at merger partners, including cable companies. TCI and Liberty Media would be acquired for $11.8 billion in stock and assumption of $9.8 billion in debt. And $5 billion in Liberty properties could likely be added to the deal. Numerous regulatory concerns made the deal tricky; regional telephone companies could not offer long distance service or transmit satellite television services such as Discovery Channel. TCI would also have to sell operations in Bell Atlantic territory. As for antitrust concerns, Bell Atlantic argued that competing telephone services could be offered where TCI had cable systems, and video services could compete with TCI. Vice President Al Gore supported the idea of improving the nation's infrastructure, and the business community took his statement to mean administration approval of the merger. The $33 billion deal, based on a $54 per share price for Bell Atlantic stock, would have been the largest in American telecommunications history, the resulting company serving one in four cable TV customers. But it fell apart for many reasons, including declining stock prices for both companies. Malone, who would have made over $1 billion, wanted more shares of Bell Atlantic when its price dropped below $54, which Ray Smith refused to do because it would lessen the value of existing shares. The two companies also had different cultures. Bell Atlantic paid dividends and was used to being regulated, while TCI tended to invest in the business rather than pay dividends. And thus ended a $20 billion project to expand the information superhighway, though other mergers promised to put the project back on track, with a more local emphasis rather than attempting a nationwide system upgrade.Retrieved on 2009-04-02. The Bell Atlantic deal also fell victim to new federal regulations that reduced cable bills up to 16 percent, costing TCI $300 million over two years. Higher spending coupled with lower cash receipts made TCI less attractive to investors, and the stock price dropped to $17 a share, half what experts believed the company was worth. Bill Nygren of Harris Associates, known for profiting from TCI's Liberty Media, said TCI could make a comeback, and Michael Mahoney of GT Capital expected the proposed deregulation of the cable and telephone industries to increase cable company revenues. Both expected TCI to benefit, especially since TCI owned 30 percent of a joint venture that included Sprint and 10 cable companies with the ability to serve 40 percent of American homes. Cable and phone companies could both offer each other's services, benefiting both companies and customers with product bundling. TCI had plans to upgrade to digital cable and offer more channels and services. Satellite TV providers would be competing to offer digital service, but TCI owned a share of Primestar, and predicted a 28 percent share of the satellite market by the end of 1995.Retrieved on 2009-04-02. In Fall 1995, Time Warner agreed to exchange $8 billion in stock for 82 percent of Turner Broadcasting System. TCI would trade its 21 percent interest in Turner for the third largest stake in Time Warner, or 9 percent. Since the resulting companies would have 40 percent of cable households, enough to cause anti-trust concern, TCI agreed to let Time Warner's Gerald Levin represent TCI.Johnnie L. Roberts, \\"The Friendly Giant: Is Time Warner Favoring Its Merger Partners?\\" Newsweek, Feb 19, 1996. This did not satisfy federal regulators. Malone ended the 15 percent discount on Turner programming that would have lasted 20 years, and Time Warner had to pay $67 million to cover TCI's taxes due.Retrieved on 2009-04-02. Magness died in November 1996, with a 26 percent share of the company. No one believed this meant the end of Malone's tenure as head of TCI, even though Malone called Magness his \\"mentor\\" and \\"father figure\\". Still, TCI had $15 billion in debt and negative cash flow of $400 million for 1996. Malone believed he could turn the company around. This meant higher rates for customers as well as programmers. Malone even succeeded in getting Fox News Channel to pay $200 million for his companies to add the network. At the same time, cost cutting had to take place, and many of the cable customers were in rural areas with old equipment and limited offerings. Upgrading to fiber optic service, which could be used for Internet and telephone service, would be cost-effective only in urban areas. Satellite TV, while not a major threat yet, represented a possible problem in the future. The good news: satellite companies could not offer local channels or phone service, and individual dishes served only one TV. The new technologies had two benefits for TCI. First, customers would need set-top boxes, which TCI already had ordered from General Instrument. Another advantage was technology developed by a new company called Imedia which would allow four times as many channels to be delivered using existing technology, even in areas not getting fiber-optic service. On the other hand, digital service had its disadvantages. Customers who did not even want a box would still lose channels so that digital channels could be added. And General Instrument only reluctantly agreed to allow multiple suppliers to bring TCI's costs down.Retrieved on 2009-04-02. In 1997 TCI sold ten of its cable systems in NJ and NY to Cablevision. TCI improved its fortunes, hiring Leo Hindery as president and making Malone chairman and CEO. Still, it was regarded as a company likely to be taken over. TCI was acquired by AT&T; in 1999 and in 2002, Comcast acquired the rest of TCI's cable television systems. Merger In 1997 TCI merged with the Kearns- Tribune Corp., publisher of The Salt Lake Tribune, Utah's largest newspaper. Kearns-Tribune Corp. was a large holder of TCI stock. On June 24, 1998, AT&T;, the nation's largest provider of telephone service, announced a plan to buy TCI, second to Time Warner among cable operators with 13 million customers, for $32 billion in stock and $16 billion in assumed debt. This marked the first major merger between phone and cable since deregulation. The new company, to be called AT&T; Consumer Services, planned to \\"significantly accelerate\\" efforts to offer digital telephone, data and video services as the companies combined the long distance, wireless and dial-up Internet service of AT&T; with the cable, high-speed Internet and telecommunications services of TCI. For the first time, AT&T; would be able to offer local telephone service. To do this, the company could have bought a Baby bell such as SBC Communications (which purchased AT&T; in 2005 and took the AT&T; name), but this would have meant regulatory problems. Liberty Media stockholders would receive separate tracking stock.Retrieved on 2009-04-02. Federal regulators and the two companies' shareholders approved the merger February 17, 1999. By that time, the value of the stock portion of the deal had increased to $43.5 billion. The Federal Communications Commission did not require TCI to give other companies access to its cable lines, despite requests by America Online and others. TCI had made its cable lines capable of providing Internet access, and AT&T; wanted those same lines to provide local phone service, which it was already doing in another agreement with Time Warner. AT&T; completed its acquisition March 9, 1999, and TCI became AT&T; Broadband and Internet Services, the company's largest unit, with Hindery its chief executive. Malone moved over to Liberty Media, which remained a separate stock and included newer TCI businesses under the heading of TCI Ventures.

New York Airways was a helicopter airline in the New York City area, founded in 1949 as a mail and cargo carrier. On 9 July 1953 it may have been the first scheduled helicopter airline to carry passengers in the United States, with headquarters at LaGuardia Airport.No other helicopter airlines in the world were carrying passengers at that time, but BEA had scheduled passenger flights on S-51s starting in 1950. American Aviation 1 July 1947 p15 says Skyway was carrying passengers to Boston Airport on S-51s in 1947.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. May 3, 1957. 608. Although primarily a helicopter airline operator with scheduled passenger operations, New York Airways also flew fixed wing aircraft, such as the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 19-passenger STOL twin turboprop aircraft.airliners.net, New York Airways DHC-6 Twin Otter photostimetableimages.com, New York Airways July 7, 1969 system timetable History Boeing Vertol 107-II after landing at JFK Passenger flights started with Sikorsky S-55 helicopters, with three Sikorsky S-58s added to its five S-55s in 1956; in 1958 the Boeing Vertol V-44, a 15-seat civil version of the Piasecki H-21, took over.Aviation Week for 9 Jan 1961 says direct operating costs for a Vertol 44 were 31 cents per seat-mile, so with it the airline would need permanent subsidy. In 1962 they transitioned to the tandem rotor, twin turbine engine powered Boeing Vertol 107-II TurbocopterAviation Week for 9 January 1961 says with the Vertol 107 \\"it will be possible to operate with vertical takeoff capability instead of the takeoff roll necessary with the single-engine piston H-44B. This feature will be of utmost importance in serving community center sites...\\" and later operated the twin turbine engine Sikorsky S-61. In February 1955 the one-way fare from LaGuardia to Idlewild was $4.50 (~$43 2019 dollars). The aircraft was a Sikorsky H-19, registration number N418A. The trip took ten minutes and their phone number was DEfender 5-6600. The first scheduled passenger flights to Manhattan arrived in December 1956 at the new heliport west of the West Side Highway at 30th St. The downtown heliport on East River Pier 6 opened in 1960 and New York Airways moved all its Manhattan passenger flights down there around December 1960. Due to route restrictions on the single-engine Vertol 44, nonstop flights from Manhattan to Idlewild had to await the twin-engine Boeing Vertol 107. Moody's says in 1962 the \\"operating revenue\\" of $3.9 million included $2.2 million federal subsidy. In June 1964 they had 32 daily flights from JFK to Newark Airport and 33 returning; all flights each way between about 0900 and 1930 stopped at Wall Street. The only other flights were 15 round trips a day between JFK and the Port Authority building at the World's Fair, as La Guardia was still under construction. Scheduled flights to the top of the Pan Am Building (now MetLife Building) began in December 1965; they ended in 1968, then resumed for a few months in 1977. In April 1966 23 flights a day flew nonstop to Pan Am's terminal at JFK, scheduled 10 minutes; passengers could check in at the Pan Am Building 40 minutes before their scheduled departure out of JFK. The downtown heliport had 13 flights a day to Newark, 5 nonstops to TWA's terminal at JFK and 12 to LGA, all of which continued to JFK. (Downtown had no weekend flights.) Soon after Pan Am Building flights resumed the March 1977 Official Airline Guide (OAG) showed 48 weekday S-61 departures from there: 12 to EWR, 14 to LGA then JFK, and 22 nonstops to JFK. New York Airways employed the first African American airline pilot. Perry H. Young made his historic first flight on February 5, 1957. Young had previously made history as the first African American flight instructor for the United States Army Air Corps. Destinations At its peak the airline partnered with 24 international and domestic airlines. At various times it served: * John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) * LaGuardia Airport (LGA) * Newark Airport (EWR) * West 30th St, Manhattan * \\"Wall Street\\" Heliport * Stamford, Connecticut Heliport * Teterboro Airport (TEB) * Westchester County Airport (HPN) * Downtown Trenton * New Brunswick * Hadley Field * Morristown Municipal Airport In 1969 the Official Airline Guide (OAG) listed some inter-airport flights using STOL Twin Otters along with the Vertol flights. Fuel prices soared after the 1973 oil crisis, damaging profitability. The airline could not recover after the 1977 Pan Am Building accident and the 1979 oil crisis, and New York Airways filed for bankruptcy on May 18, 1979. The number of passengers boarded, in thousands, scheduled flights only were 68 in 1957, 144 in 1960, 537 in 1967, 268 in 1970. Fleet Interior shot of N6682D as it prepares to depart the Pan Am Building in September, 1967.

N6682D is in the 1968 film Coogan's Bluff, starring Clint Eastwood, taking off atop the Pan Am Building. N108PA is the helicopter arriving with Eastwood. N6676D is shown taking off from the Downtown Manhattan/Wall St. Heliport in the last of the Secret Agent 077 trilogy of films, 1966's Special Mission Lady Chaplin. It appears in the 1967 spy thriller Matchless, arriving and taking off from the Pan Am Building. Accidents On October 14, 1963 New York Airways Flight 600, a Boeing Vertol 107, registration N6673D, crashed shortly after takeoff from Idlewild Airport (now JFK) en route to Newark via Wall Street. All three passengers and all three crew members died. The accident was caused by mechanical failure due to contaminated lubricants. On May 16, 1977, the landing gear failed on a Sikorsky S-61L (N619PA) while it was taking on passengers on the roof of the Pan Am Building. The aircraft rolled onto its side. Its spinning rotor blades killed four passengers waiting to board (including movie director Michael Findlay) and injured a fifth. Parts of a broken blade fell into the streets below, killing one pedestrian and injuring another. The accident precipitated the permanent closure of the heliport. On April 18, 1979, a Sikorsky S-61L (N618PA), while on departure climbout from Newark International Airport, experienced a fracture of one of the tail rotor blades, resulting in severe vibrations and an immediate return and descent to the airport. At about 150 feet altitude, the entire tail rotor gearbox was torn from the aircraft, resulting in an immediate and radical center of gravity change to the aircraft. This caused a severe nose down attitude and uncontrolled contact with the ground. Compounding the accident was the failure of both hydraulic systems due to the loss of the tail rotor gear box, which rendered the aircraft virtually uncontrollable. There were three fatalities and thirteen serious injuries. The airline ceased flying that day and never resumed operations, filing for bankruptcy the following month.

The suburb is oriented along a ridge running north‚Äìsouth, which is followed by the main street of the suburb, Ponsonby Road. A predominantly upper-middle class residential suburb, Ponsonby today is also known in Auckland for its dining and shopping establishments ‚Äì many restaurants, cafes, art galleries, up-market shops and nightclubs are located along Ponsonby Road. The borders of Ponsonby are often seen as being rather fluid, taking in St Mary's Bay and Herne Bay to the north and including Freemans Bay to the east and Grey Lynn to the south - Ponsonby is properly bounded by Jervois Road to the North and Richmond Road to the south but extends down Ponsonby road all the way to the Karangahape road corner - the boundary with Freemans Bay to the east is less clear. The area was originally a working class to middle class area. From the Great Depression until the 1980s it contained many rundown buildings, and had a somewhat 'colourful' reputation. This was partially due to some criminal elements, its many Maori and Pacific Island residents and (from the 1970s onwards) student flats and an association with Auckland's arts and gay/lesbian scenes. Ponsonby includes an area called Three Lamps which is located at the north end of the street. This name is derived from a 19th-century Lamppost (now reconstructed - see below), There are other locations called Three Lamps for the same reason; intersections in the UK - Crewe and Totterdown in Bristol which might conceivably have influenced the derivation here. There was also a Pub with that name in Swansea, Wales and a location in Macau in China. The suburb has undergone extensive gentrification over the last two decades, arguably returning it to its largely middle class origins. Its postcode is 1011. The MƒÅori name for the ridge is Te Rimu Tahi ('The Lone Rimu Tree', referring to an ancient tree which, it is claimed, stood in a prominent position at what is now the intersection of Ponsonby Road and Karangahape Road).Ponsonby Heritage Walks ‚Äì Mace, Tania; Ponsonby Road Promotions & Auckland City Council, ca. 2005 Ponsonby is named after Ponsonby Road which runs the length of the ridge from the Karangahape Road intersection to the south to the Three Lamps intersection to the north. En route there are three major intersections; Williamson Avenue, which is the main thoroughfare of Grey Lynn to the west, Richmond Road (again to the west), which divides Grey Lynn and Ponsonby and Franklin Road, which is the main road in Freemans Bay to the east.  Name  The area now referred to as Three Lamps was originally called Dedwood in 1845, after a farm in Shelly Beach Road, which was apparently named after a Captain Dedwood. The name was changed to Ponsonby in 1873, apparently derived from Ponsonby Road which first appears on an 1850s Map of Auckland. Ponsonby is now applied to a larger area (as described above). There are various people who might have inspired the name Ponsonby: * Major-General Sir Henry Ponsonby (private secretary to Queen Victoria, 1870‚Äì1895) * The Honourable Ponsonby Peacocke, a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council * Colonel Frederick Cavendish Ponsonby * Major-General Sir William Ponsonby Sir Henry Ponsonby became private secretary to the Queen just before the name change in 1873; it is unlikely however that his name would have been very well known and Ponsonby Road appears as early as the mid 1850s. His surname is thus the least likely source for the naming of the road (and eventually the new name for the suburb) The Hon. Colonel Stephen Ponsonby Peacocke (also known as Ponsonby Peacocke) was a member of the Legislative Council (1866). He was living on Ponsonby Road in the 1860s and died in 1872. His Christian name is an unlikely source for the naming of the road and there is a map from the mid 1850s showing Ponsonby Road which may predate Peacocke's arrival in New Zealand in 1858. The Vandeleur connection: It is widely believed that what is now Ponsonby Road was originally called Vandeleur Road, but this is not backed up by evidence. One of the earliest maps of Auckland (1841 by the Surveyor General, Felton Mathew), does show a Vandeleur Road in the general area. However it does not run in the same direction as the existing Ponsonby Road and it was probably never laid out - if it had been it would run north‚Äìsouth and sit between the existing Howe and Hepburn Streets (basically where Western Park is located). Many of the early street names of Auckland were derived from military men involved in the Napoleonic Wars; this includes Wellington and Nelson. The Ponsonby area contains several examples; Collingwood, Cockburn, Anglesea, Picton, Vandeleur and Ponsonby. Major-General Sir John Vandeleur was a Divisional Commander at Waterloo and Colonel Frederick Ponsonby was a regimental commander under him. His relative Major-General Sir William Ponsonby was also at Waterloo. Neither Frederick or William Ponsonby or Vandeleur came to New Zealand but they are probably the source for the street names and ultimately the suburb's name.  History  1841 Jane Griffin (Lady Franklin), wife of Sir John Franklin the Governor of Tasmania, visits Auckland. During her time in Auckland she walks up a track in the Ponsonby area subsequently named for her as Franklin Road. mid1840s Governor Hobson's secretary James Stuart Freeman lives in the area subsequently known as \\"Freemans Bay\\". 1848 The area now known as Ponsonby is included in the \\"Hundred of Auckland\\". 1851 The \\"Suburban West Ward\\" is created which includes what is now Ponsonby. 1854 James O'Neill's house becomes St. Anne's School for Maori Girls run by the Sisters of Mercy. Responding to a Maori request for holy women to teach the children, the sisters of Mercy had arrived in Auckland from Ireland in 1850 already fluent in the Maori language. Their first school and orphanage was situated near St Patrick's Cathedral. 1854 St Mary's College for Catechists on the North Shore is transferred to St Mary's Bay, St. Marys School for Boys & a Seminary are built on of Crown Grant land at the end of Waitemata St. 1858 The Church of the Immaculate Conception is built (it is demolished in 1869 ‚Äì 70, the site is now the Pompalier Tennis Club). 1859 New Street is put through the middle of the St Mary Mount estate and Bishop Pompallier presents land on the eastern side of the street for the creation of St. Mary's College. Almost unaided the sisters erect a three-storey convent building and open it in 1861. The only surviving building from this period is the Kauri St Mary's Chapel constructed in 1865 by Edward Mahoney for ¬£1100. 1860s Many Roman Catholics buy land in the new subdivisions in order to be near the Catholic centre with its Church, Convent & Schools. Names such as \\"Dublin\\" & \\"Green\\" reflect this development. 1860 Bishop Pompallier returns from Europe with a group of French nuns. Under his direction they form the Congregation of the Holy Family, which concentrates on teaching Maori girls. 1861 St. Anne's boarding school occupies O'Neill's former house. 1862 The Convent is completed. The new order of the Holy Family takes over teaching at the school. The order now consists of Maori as well as French Sisters. 1862 The Bishop takes over O'Neill's former house as his official residence. 1863 The Bishop sells more land, retaining the with the Bishop's House, The Church of the Holy Family and the Convent of the Holy Family. The Nazareth Institute for Maori and Half-Caste Girls is founded. 1863 The 1863 map of Auckland shows the road from Karangahape Rd to Franklin Rd labelled as Ponsonby Rd. At this time Jervois Rd is also called Ponsonby Rd. The map does not show the piece of road from Franklin Rd to College Hill that is called Vandeleur Rd. 1866 All Saints ParishAll Saint Parish website is formed and a Sunday School opened. 1866 St. Mary's Convent, with its dormitories and Chapel, is built. 1865-68 The Suffolk Hotel (now the Cavalier Tavern) is built on College Hill. 1869 - 70 The Convent of the Holy Family is destroyed by fire. The Catholic Bishop is forced by his mortgagee to sell his remaining land, including the Bishop's House. The buyer is a Mr. Bennett who demolishes the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The Bishop resigns and leaves, leading to the dissolution of the order he had formed; the Order of the Holy Family. St. Mary's Convent remains. 1871 The Ponsonby and Dedwood Highway District is formed. 1871 Dedwood Post office is opened. 1872 The Anglican parish of All Saints is officially defined. 1872 The Ponsonby Anglican householders meet with local Education Board. The schoolroom of All Saints Church is rented at 30 per year to house Dedwood School. By 1874 Dedwood School is attended by 100 girls and 74 boys. 1873 The name of the area is officially changed from Dedwood to Ponsonby. 1873 Bishop Croke, the second Catholic Bishop of Auckland, buys back the land with the Bishop's house on it. In 1874 the wooden house is moved to its present location at 57 St. Mary's Road. 1873 A contest for the design of City Park (now known as Western Park) is held. Sir George Grey and Judge Thomas Gillies donate specimen trees. 1876 Ponsonby becomes part of the Newton Constituency. 1876 St Stephens Presbyterian Church, Jervois Rd, is built. 1877 St Johns Church, Ponsonby Road, is built. 1879 Western Park opens. However work on the project continues for several decades. 1879 A school opens in Beresford St known as Harrison's School named after its headmaster. 1882 Ponsonby is amalgamated with the Auckland City Council area. 1883 Lieutenant-General Sir William Jervois becomes Governor of New Zealand [1883-1889]. Part of Ponsonby Road is renamed Jervois Road after him. 1884 The first horse tram service from Queen Street to Ponsonby is started. The route is from Three Lamps to Queen St via K'Rd, Pitt St, & Grey St. The fare is threepence. Trams ran every 15 minutes from 6.30am to 10.30pm at an average speed of an hour. 1885 to 1890 An economic slump follows the stock market crash. \\"[W]hole streets such as John Street and Clarence Street had not a soul living in them. Workmen's cottages handy to Queen Street brought half a crown per week: further out, say Ponsonby, such cottages were gladly let free of rent\\". 1886 The water reservoir at the corner of K'Rd and Ponsonby road is built. 1886 The Ponsonby Baptist Church is built. The 1778 Avery pipe organ is said to be originally from Windsor Castle, a gift from Queen Victoria to Old St. Pauls, Emily Place, which had been demolished the previous year. 1886 - 1887 The Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart is built on the corner of O'Neill St and Ponsonby Road. This took over the role of Parish Church from St Mary's Chapel. 1887 The Ponsonby Seventh Day Adventist Church in McKelvie Street is opened. 1889 The Grey Lynn Borough Council Chambers & Volunteer Fire Station in Williamson Avenue is built by John Mitchell. 1893 The Ponsonby Catholic Parish School building in O'Neill St is opened; in 1913 when the school is moved to Vermont St the building became a hall. 1894 The New Bishop's Palace is constructed to the designs of Pugin & Pugin (sons of Augustus Welby Pugin, the Gothic enthusiast responsible for much of the decorative work of the Palace of Westminster). The Bishop's Palace was partly funded by donations from all over the world, including 5000 schools in Europe and the US, the Lord Mayor of London and an Archduchess of Austria. An imposing dark brick gothic pile, it is believed to be the first house in Auckland built to include electric lighting. 1897 The Catholic Order of the Little Sisters of the Poor is established in NZ. They were first located in a two-storey house in Hepburn St and from 1904 in Tweed St. 1902 The Ponsonby Fire Station in St Marys Road is built. [Goldsbo'ro & Wade architects] 1903 The brick building housing the Auckland Gas Company in Beaumont St is constructed. 1903 3 December after a blazing row the Ponsonby Yacht club take up residence at the Rob Roy Hotel. 1905 Victoria Park is created.

The New Zealand Herald's front-page article for the completion and opening of this building was titled, \\"Ponsonby's on the move again\\". mid 1980s Two high rise apartment blocks are constructed on Jervois Rd. Following this, the Auckland City Council amends the height restrictions to make it impossible for similar buildings to be erected in the future.NZ On Screen: Top Half - Auckland Segments (Ponsonby development controversies) 1990s The LGBT presence in the Ponsonby area is expressed by various annual events, such as Coming Out Day parades & The Hero Parade. 1990s Other festivals develop in the area: the Grey Lynn Festival & Pasifika and the iconic Franklin Road Christmas lights. 1990s Less restrictive liquor laws result in a large increase in small restaurants & bars. Auckland City Council's relaxation of bylaws prohibiting pavement cafes encourages large numbers of cafes to appear. 1990s Grey Lynn is granted heritage protection under the building laws. Grey Lynn is the largest concentration of wooden Victorian buildings in the world. 1990s the Link bus service commences. 2000 A Supermarket is built on the site of the gasholders at the bottom of College Hill. 2002 The Auckland Gas Company buildings in Beaumont street are converted into a retail & residential apartment complex. 2013 2013 sees the return of the LGBT presence in the Ponsonby area with the Auckland Pride Festival Parade =Favoured suburb= From as early as the 1850s St Mary's Bay and Herne Bay were favoured by several prosperous Aucklanders for their harbour views. They built elegant \\"marine villas\\" with extensive gardens and private jetties from which they commuted to the bottom of Queen Street. These were largely accessible only from the water as the Ponsonby and Jervois ridges and the area beyond were mostly coarse scrubland. A number of these 'marine villas' still stand, now surrounded by later Edwardian suburban developments. As College Hill was too steep for horse-drawn vehicles, all traffic from the centre of Auckland came via Karangahape Road (which is why the numbering starts at the K Road end). After the establishment of the horse bus service in the 1880s a small shopping centre developed at the end of the route {what is now Three Lamps but then called Dedwood}. This shopping centre prospered as it was able to serve the larger properties in Herne Bay, the small workers cottages in College Hill and the new middle-class houses of Grey Lynn. Eventually the tram route (first horse drawn and then electric) was extended along Jervois Road, which saw more residential and retail development. The area now called Three Lamps was originally a farm called \\"Dedwood\\", apparently named after a friend of the first owners; a Captain Dedwood, who may, or may not, have served in the armed forces in New Zealand. What is now called Jervois Road was at that time called Ponsonby Road. There was apparently both a Dedwood Road Board and a Ponsonby Road Board as well as references to both a Dedwood District Board and a Ponsonby District Board. Ponsonby definitely sounded more elegant than Dedwood so by the 1870s Ponsonby was apparently used by many people to refer to the whole area. Around 1873 the name was changed from Dedwood to Ponsonby although throughout the mid 1870s public announcements refer to 'Dedwood and/or Ponsonby' just to be safe. The name change may have sounded better in real estate advertisements, but it initially caused problems; in the New Zealand Herald, Volume X, Issue 3608, 4 June 1873, Page 2 it is mentioned that the change caused problems with the area's membership of both the Harbour Board and the Domain Board as their legal documents specified the Dedwood Road Board and Dedwood District Boards. (The) Superintendent, should have intimated to the rate-payers of the Dedwood district, that by their adopting a less funereal name they would disfranchise themselves. This problem was eventually sorted out and in any case in 1882 Ponsonby, along with Karangahape and Grafton was amalgamated with Auckland City. In the 1950s and 1960s a combination of people moving to new outer suburbs, Auckland City Council policy of \\"slum\\" clearances and the construction of the motorway through Freemans Bay, led to plummeting rents and a drastic downturn in the economic fortunes of the area directly west of the CBD. The 1950s and 1960s saw many Pacific Islanders arriving in the country and they tended to take up residence in low cost areas - Ponsonby was one of them. By the 1970s, the combination of artists, bohemians, gays and lesbians, and Polynesian migrant workers, attracted by the low rents created a distinct culture in the area, with which the area is still largely identified in the popular imagination of Auckland. However, beginning in the 1980s a process of gentrification and ethnic transition took place in the area. This was reflective of patterns in other Western cities, but here it dramatically altered the suburb by the late-1990s, as the apparent predominant population of Polynesians was replaced by Pakeha as described in the Ian Middleton novel Mr Ponsonby. By the early 2000s, Ponsonby became widely perceived as a spatial centre of Auckland's so-called creative class. Upper Middle Class Professionals, usually working in the better-paid professions, as well as the culture industry became an obvious (if not dominant) presence in the area. This also reintroduced many more children into the area; the local schools, which through the 1970s and 1980s had had shrinking roles now started growing in size and the children attending them were now predominantly white rather than brown. The retail shops changed in character as well. Ponsonby Road was previously lined with second hand appliance & furniture stores, junk shops, Pacific Island fruit & vegetable shops and cheap eateries. By the late 1990s these had been largely replaced with flash bars, restaurants, 'gorgeous things' shops, dress boutiques and upmarket hairdressers. In the 1960s most people regarded Ponsonby as little better than a slum; now it is seen as a place of consumption of up-market consumer goods (particularly clothing) and dining and drinking experiences for the city's upper middle classes. The 2000s saw a number of traffic accidents (including one death) along Ponsonby Road, which is both an important traffic arterial route and a favourite nightspot. As a result, the speed limit along Ponsonby Road was lowered to 40 km/h zone in 2009. Notable buildings and landmarks Former Ponsonby Post Office Not all the older villas in the area are restored yet. Notable buildings in the suburb include: =Three Lamps Area= * The Three Lamps. Reconstructed Lamp post with the three distinctive Lanterns that gave this area its name. The Giant Lamp-post (then lit by gas) stood in the centre of the intersection and was removed in the 1930s as a traffic hazard. Three lamps of another design were placed on the corner of the gluepot Tavern to remember the name. After many years of lobbying the old Lamp post has finally been rebuilt next to the former Gluepot. (which still sports the other set of three lamps). On 10 August 2012 the Waitemata Local Board celebrated the \\"lighting up\\" and the return of the Three Lamps at the corner of Ponsonby Road and Jervois Road. * Former Ponsonby Post Office. 1‚Äì3 St Marys Bay Road. Architect: John Campbell. Erected in 1911 this is a fine example of the Edwardian Baroque Style. Campbell was Government Architect. Despite what the historic plaque to the right of the front door says, the Postmaster Augustus Braithwaite was not murdered here by Dennis Gunn in 1920 but at his house nearby in Herne Bay. His keys were then used to rob the Post Office. * Former Ponsonby Fire Station. 15 St Marys Bay Road. Architects; Goldsboro & Wade. * The Leys Institute. 20 St Marys Bay Road. Library, Lecture Hall and Gymnasium; the gift of local residents William & Thompson Leys in 1905.

Now part of the Auckland Council Public Library system. * ASB Bank: Jervois Road. This small neo-classical building is one of the many buildings commissioned by the Auckland Savings Bank from the architect Daniel B. Patterson. Similar buildings appear in Auckland suburban centres and in provincial towns throughout the Auckland Province. * Plunket Rooms and Memorial Drinking Fountain. Jervois Road. Behind the unassuming 1940s modernist Plunket Rooms is a small grassed area with a memorial drinking fountain dedicated to local politician Michael Joseph Savage. Savage was MP for the area as well as local resident. He died suddenly in 1940 while in office as Prime Minister. * Former Gluepot Hotel. Cnr Ponsonby and Jervois Roads.

Built in 1910 as a roller-skating rink and remodelled as a cinema in the 1920s. Converted into a shopping plaza in 1982 it is now Three Lamps Plaza. * Renall Street. A Heritage Area. In the 1970s this whole street was demarcated by the Auckland City Council as a special heritage area. The street contains a representative collection of buildings; 19th century workers cottages, Edwardian villas, 1920s bungalows & 1930 houses with an Edwardian Freemasons Hall. * All Saints Church. Architect; Prof Richard Toy. An award-winning building from the 1950s which replaced an earlier wooden Victorian church. =Ponsonby Road= * Former Letholite Luggage Factory: 239 Ponsonby Road. Erected in 1919 for the firm of Palmer, Collins & Whittaker. The factory was extended in 1929 and in the 1970s the business employed 50 workers, making it an important employer for this area. Letholite was a major supplier of good quality luggage to the New Zealand public. From the 1980s to the late 1990s the building was the location of Joes Bargain House, after which the building was extensively renovated as office/retail space. * St John's Methodist Church. 229 Ponsonby Road. Architect; Edward Bartley. Built in the 1880s this is a fine example of a wooden church in the Gothic style. This building includes carved detailing by Anton Teutonberg the first European sculptor in New Zealand. * Doctor's House, 225 Ponsonby Road. From 1908 to 1920 Florence Keller and her husband Martin ran their doctors surgery from this location. The American Florence Keller was a Seventh-day Adventist, who, when she died in her mid 90s was the oldest practising surgeon in the world. * Terrace Houses, 203‚Äì209 Ponsonby Road. Built for E. Marian Edger (sister of Kate Edger and Lilian Edgar). An interesting development dating from around 1900 these brick built houses with cement stucco finish are a half-way point between the London Town houses and the contemporary wooden villas of New Zealand. =Franklin Road intersection= * Vermont Street Shops. 222-224 Ponsonby Road. Fine sey of Edwardian shops - recently restored. * Ponsonby Mosque. 17 Vermont Street.

Later sold to John Klisser the firm has grown into a major manufacturer of baked goods and specifically Vogel's Bread. =Williamson Avenue intersection= * Former Newton Borough Council Chambers & Fire Station 1889. 1 Williamson Avenue. Architect; John Mitchell. The upper floor was built as offices for the Local Borough Council. In 1898 this part of Newton was renamed Grey Lynn, and then in 1914 it was absorbed into Auckland City and the local government function of this building ceased. Now a cafe/bar. * Western Park. The city's oldest park, the result of a competition in 1872. Some of the large specimen trees were donated by notable people such as Sir George Grey and Sir Maurice O'Rorke. Park furniture designed in the 1990s by Micheal Von Sturmer, sculptures by John Radford and mosaic panels by Mark Davidson. * Allendale House. 50 Ponsonby Road.

A group of three Italianate town houses built for Alfred Adams in the 1890s. Adams occupied the middle house for a short time. In the 1970s and 1980s this was the location of \\"The Palace\\" Massage Parlour during which time it was painted a bright pink. These houses were built with double storied wooden verandahs similar to nearby Allandale house. Now bereft of these verandahs the houses look slightly bare but actually more italianate in style. =Karangahape Road intersection= * Former ASB Bank. 8 Ponsonby Road. Architect Edward Bartley.

The first reservoir on this site was designed by the City Engineer William Errington. That structure from the 1880s was rebuilt in the 1950s when the adjoining Pumping Station and Turncock's house were demolished. This reservoir is gravity fed with water from the WaitƒÅkere Ranges. * VAANA PEACE MURAL. Visual Artists Against Nuclear Arms. In 1985, eight founding VAANA artists: Pat Hanly, Margaret Lawlor-Bartlett, Jill Carter-Hansen, John Nicol, John Eaden, Claudia Pond Eyley, Nigel Brown and Vanya Lowry each painted large panels in the main gallery at Outreach (now Artstation) with members of the public giving verbal encouragement. Master potters Peter Lange and Lex Dawson worked with Master Builder Matt Stafford to fix the panels to the wall. The mural was recreated in 2006 with extra panels being added.  Demographics  cafe culture as well as a historical reputation for being Auckland's gay quarter. Ponsonby, comprising the statistical areas of Ponsonby West and Ponsonby East, had a population of 5,730 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 153 people (2.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 243 people (4.4%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,085 households. There were 2,763 males and 2,967 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.93 males per female, with 951 people (16.6%) aged under 15 years, 1,299 (22.7%) aged 15 to 29, 2,970 (51.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 513 (9.0%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 83.4% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 8.8% MƒÅori, 8.6% Pacific peoples, 9.2% Asian, and 3.2% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 29.6%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 58.2% had no religion, 31.2% were Christian, and 5.6% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 2,415 (50.5%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 273 (5.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,063 (64.1%) people were employed full-time, 639 (13.4%) were part-time, and 144 (3.0%) were unemployed. While official statistics are not collected, Ponsonby is also popularly imagined as having a large gay population relative to other Auckland suburbs. A survey by the NZ AIDS Foundation has however found that the stereotype seems to be true, and that the area and the directly adjacent suburbs have a (in comparison) very high percentage of gay people, possibly attracted by the fact that they feel more at ease in an environment where gay people are relatively commonplace. Education St Paul's College is a state- integrated Catholic boys' secondary school (years 7-13) with a roll of students. Marist School is a Catholic coeducational contributing primary school (years 1-6) with a roll of which shares the same site.

It was founded in 1985 in Milwaukee by Randal Sprecher, and is Milwaukee's first craft brewery since Prohibition. Sprecher produces an assortment of beers, flavored malt beverages, and sodas. Sprecher produces another line of beers under its Chameleon Brewing Company label that is well-respected but not widely available. Despite producing a full range of award-winning craft beers, the brewery is arguably best known for its Black Bavarian (schwarzbier) and premium sodas. Sprecher brews more root beer than all of its alcoholic beers combined. History Founder Randal Sprecher, a California native, earned his first degree in oceanography and his second in brewing. He was employed by Pabst in Milwaukee. After just over four years at Pabst, he founded his own brewery in 1985. The new brewery was started on a budget of $40,000. Sprecher purchased equipment to keep costs down, including a 16-oz. bottling machine from Coca-Cola, and some of this equipment remains in use today. The current Sprecher facility was acquired in 1994. Production Raw Wisconsin honey is used as a primary ingredient in its root beer, and Sprecher Ginger Ale uses locally grown ginger. The brewery has started hop production, along with several others Wisconsin craft breweries, and has been producing small batches of fresh \\"green\\" hop brews. =Year-round beers= * Special Amber - Vienna Lager * Black Bavarian - Schwarzbier * Hefe Weiss - Bavaria wheat ale * Pub Ale - British Brown * Abbey Triple - Belgian Triple * Shakparo (gluten free) Sprecher Shakparo * Piper's Scotch Ale - (smokey) Scotch Ale * IPA-2 (Double or Imperial) IPA * Hometown Brew - European-style lager * Grapefruit Radler - Wheat ale with grapefruit flavors * Hard Root Beer - Malt Beverage * Hard Ginger Beer - Malt Beverage * Hard Apple Pie - Malt Beverage =Seasonal beers= Seasonal beers include: * Stout - Dry Irish-style Stout(Spring) * Mai Bock - (Spring Bock) * Summer Pils - Czech Pilsner (Summer) * Oktoberfest - Marzen (Autumn) * Dopple Bock - (Winter) * Imperial stout - (Winter) * Winter Lager - Munich Dunkel Bock(Winter)(formerly Winter Brew) =Limited release beers= * Barley Wine Ale * Czar Brew - Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Stout * Commando - Bourbon Barrel Aged Scotch Ale * Beyon Braggot * XII - Belgian- style Quad * Generation Porter (Porter with cocoa and tart raspberry) * WIPL, Dry hopped with fresh Wisconsin Cascades WI Co-op hop yard)Amber Ale (formerly HopFuzion) * CitraBomb =Sodas= Sprecher root beer * Root Beer * Cream Soda * Puma Kola - Cola with vanilla + Cinnamon * Cherry Cola * Orange Dream - Orange + honey + vanilla * Ginger Ale - (Wisconsin Ginger) * Ginger Beer * Lo- Cal Root Beer * Cherry-Cran (cherry + cranberry + honey +WI ginseng)[formerly Ravin' Red] * Grape * Strawberry (Seasonal) * Red Apple (Seasonal) * Red Raspberry (Seasonal) * Raspberry (Seasonal) * Blueberry (Seasonal) * Maple Syrup Root Beer (Seasonal) The Lo-Cal Root Beer is fairly rare in the soft drink industry in that it is sweetened with Sodium Saccharin rather than a newer artificial sweetner. =Chameleon Beers= * Hop on Top, Aroma Hop Ale * Witty, White Wheat Ale brewed with spices * Firelight, English-style summer ale * Ryediculous, Rye IPA  Brewery Tour  Sprecher Brewery offers year- round tours of its facility, including the brew house, the refrigerated cellar, and the bottling line and warehouse.

He is the primary antagonist of King's eight-volume Dark Tower series, as well as the novels Insomnia (1994) and Black House (2001). Described as \\"Gan's crazy side\\", the Crimson King is the ultimate ruler of the Red (also called the Random and the Outer Dark), and the archetypal embodiment of evil in Stephen King's fictional multiverse. His goal is to topple the Dark Tower which serves as the linchpin of time and space, destroying the multitude of universes which revolve around it so that he can rule in the primordial chaos which follows. Appearances =Literature= The Crimson King is introduced in the Stephen King novel Insomnia, where he is depicted as a powerful and mysterious entity that forces others to do his bidding. He seeks to kill a child named Patrick Danville who is prophesied to aid in bringing the King down; he is defeated during a confrontation with that novel's protagonist, Ralph Roberts. He makes his next appearance at the end of Black House, where he is revealed to be responsible for the events of that novel and is seen to have been weakened by the actions of protagonist Jack Sawyer and his allies. In the Dark Tower novels, the King is revealed to be behind the destruction of the beams that hold up the Dark Tower which holds reality and all of the universes together. He is shown to have gone insane and his intentions are not quite clear beyond that he wishes to destroy the Tower and possibly rule the darkness that would follow. He rules from the lands of Discordia and, as his insanity worsens, he kills nearly everyone in his employ and even kills himself. He thus becomes undead and possibly immune to Roland's guns. He reaches the tower before Roland, but is trapped on a balcony on one of its lower levels. When Roland finally meets the King at the climax of the final Dark Tower novel, he appears as an old man with a white beard and blood- red eyes who throws \\"sneetches\\" from his imprisonment in the Tower. As previously predicted, Roland and Patrick Danville bring about the Crimson King's downfall. Patrick captures the King's image with his supernatural artistic abilities, using a mixture of Roland's blood and a rose's petals to finish the drawing; then he erases the King from existence, forever banishing him to some other world, or to the todash space between the worlds. Only his red eyes remain, trapped eternally on the balcony of the Tower. =Comics= Writer Robin Furth wrote a new backstory for the Crimson King in the Dark Tower comics. Here, the Crimson King was the bastard offspring of Arthur Eld, a legendary gunslinger, and the Crimson Queen, a demonic creature of the Prim ‚Äì the chaotic primordial void from which the Dark Tower, and all universes, arose. With the aid of the wizard Maerlyn, the Crimson Queen took on human form and deceived Arthur Eld to achieve this union. The protagonist of the series, Roland Deschain, is himself a distant descendant of Eld; this makes the Crimson King a half-uncle of Roland, albeit through many generations. This is the key through which Roland can defeat the King, as stated in a prophecy laid out during the course of the series. In the one-shot comic The Dark Tower: The Sorcerer, Randall Flagg and the Pink Grapefruit (one of the thirteen Bends o' the Rainbow) refer to the Crimson King as their cousin.  Characteristics  The Crimson King has taken many forms throughout the series. In The Dark Tower VI, Susannah tells Mia that, in her world, people see the Crimson King as a horned, red-skinned monster called Satan. As evidenced in Insomnia, the Crimson King is a shapeshifter; like the titular creature in It, he takes the form most terrifying to whoever confronts him. When he is injured by Ralph Roberts, he reverts first to a handsome, blonde man, and then to a creature Ralph is unable to see properly, suggesting that his true form cannot be comprehended by human beings. When he finally appears near the end of the Dark Tower series, the Crimson King has the appearance of an old man with white hair and one fang, but in the comics he appears both as a monstrous entity with spiderlike characteristics much like his son Mordred, as well as a bald man with a large tusk or horn on his head. Throughout all of his appearances his one defining characteristic is his blood red eyes, which fascinate anyone who looks into them. Patrick Danville also mentions that the King fades in and out of view due to his transcendent magical powers. The Crimson King prefers to work from behind the scenes. His sigil, a glaring red eye, is seen throughout each of the books in which he has appeared. He employs other people to do his bidding, as well as numerous supernatural beings, including Atropos, Mr. Munshun, Dandelo, Randall Flagg, John Farson, and various vampires, low men, and taheen.  In other King works  The Crimson King is also mentioned in the Stephen King novella Low Men in Yellow Coats, found within the 1999 collection Hearts in Atlantis. He is also hinted at in The Stand by Mother Abagail. As she describes main antagonist Randall Flagg, she mentions that, \\"He ain't Satan, but he and Satan know of each other and have kept their councils together of old.\\"  See also  * Touched by the Crimson King  References   External links  * Official Dark Tower web site * Official site for The Dark Tower Comics * Theories on the Crimson King The Dark Tower (series) characters Fictional demons and devils Fictional kings Fictional mass murderers Fictional shapeshifters Fictional telepaths Marvel Comics demons Literary characters introduced in 1994 Characters in American novels of the 20th century Characters in American novels of the 21st century Male literary villains Stephen King characters Fictional suicides ","title":"Crimson King"},{"id":"1214071","text":"The Carnic Alps (; ; ; ) are a range of the Southern Limestone Alps in Austria and northeastern Italy.

Roberts joined NBC in May 2000 after serving as a sports reporter for almost 12 years at ESPN and ABC Sports where he won 11 Sports Emmy Awards. Biography =Early life and career= Roberts grew up in White Plains, New York, and graduated from White Plains High School in 1975. In high school, he played varsity lacrosse, was the school's morning announcer (originating the morning joke of the day), and occasionally wrote columns for his high-school newspaper, The Orange. His journalism career began in 1975 when he started as a newspaper reporter. Roberts also worked under Howard Cosell as a writer and producer at ABC. His writing is regarded as some of the best in all of broadcast journalism. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park. During his time at Maryland, Roberts worked at the popular campus hangout R.J. Bentley's Filling Station; one of his sports Emmys is on display there. =NBC Sports= Roberts is the interviewer for NBC's golf coverage, in addition to hosting the halftime show for Notre Dame football, being one of the main anchors for NBC's weekend sports updates, anchoring the network's coverage of the French Open, and worked as a field reporter for NBC's coverage of the 2000 American League Championship Series. He also reported on horse racing. Roberts has won two Emmys since joining NBC. Roberts has worked 10 Olympic Games in his broadcasting career. At the Olympics for NBC, he has hosted a nightly feature called the Chevy Olympic Moments, which talk about a different athlete or the history of a certain place at an Olympics. Roberts served as a correspondent for NBC Sports coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics.Medium Well: Your NBC Olympics lineup ‚Äì A blog on sports media, news and networks ‚Äì baltimoresun.com =Other work= Roberts hosted and narrated the Outdoor Life Network's coverage of the 2005 Dakar Rally. In April 2009, Roberts published his first book, Breaking the Slump (HarperCollins), which detailed the struggles of many famous golfers, including Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, George Herbert Walker Bush, and others and how they found their way through the inevitable challenges that plague anyone who plays the game. Roberts also did field reporting for ABC's coverage of the Little League World Series. =Personal life= Roberts and his wife, Sandra Mayer, have three sons and they all live in Westchester County, New York. Roberts' sister-in-law, Debbie Mayer, worked in the south tower on the 56th floor at New York City's World Trade Center. Immediately after American Airlines Flight 11 (the first aircraft of the September 11, 2001, attacks) struck the north tower, Mayer began going downstairs to leave the building. She had gotten to the 29th floor when the second aircraft struck, hitting the building she worked in. However, Mayer escaped safely before the towers collapsed. Roberts told of the ordeal to USA Today: > We had a couple of very anxious hours. My wife couldn't get through to > Debbie. Finally, she went to her Manhattan apartment to wait for her. And > she found her there. Turns out when the first explosion occurred in Building > 1, Debbie started down the stairs.

It is immediately to the west of Saint Helen's Island and west of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the city of Saint-Lambert on the south shore. Together with Saint Helen's Island, it makes up Parc Jean- Drapeau, which forms part of the Hochelaga Archipelago. To the southwest, the island is connected to the embankment separating the seaway and Lachine Rapids. Parc Jean-Drapeau is registered as a leg of the Route Verte and Trans Canada Trail. It houses the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host of the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One. History Notre Dame Island was built in ten months from 15 million tons of rock excavated for the Montreal Metro underground rail in 1965. It was created for Expo 67 to celebrate Canada's centennial. Nearly all of the remaining Expo 67 pavilions were demolished in 1975 to make way for a long rowing and canoeing basin for Montreal's 1976 Summer Olympics. The Olympic Basin is still North America's largest artificial rowing basin. The former pavilion of France and the pavillon of Quebec were gutted, redecorated, and became the Montreal Casino, as a large gambling establishment owned and operated by the Government of Quebec. The Canadian Pavilion now serves the administration of the Soci√©t√© du parc Jean-Drapeau, a para-municipal body of the city of Montreal, manager of Parc Jean-Drapeau. The park area on the island's western tip has a small lake with a beach open throughout the summer for swimming, volleyball and watercraft rentals. During the decades since Expo 67, the city of Montreal has embellished the island with plants and trees, making it look less artificial. In 1980 the greening and beautification of the island was accelerated when it was the host to the Floralies Internationales, a horticultural exhibition and competition gathering plant masterpieces from dozens of countries. Still accessible today from spring to autumn, these magnificent gardens cover over . The Floralies gardens are preserved and arranged creatively by the Parc Jean-Drapeau team of gardeners. In addition, the micro-climate created in part by the lagoons crisscrossing the island promotes the uniqueness of these gardens by allowing plants usually intolerant of Montreal's cold climate to grow. The park hosted the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 1986. Off-season In fall and spring, visitors to Notre Dame Island primarily consist of gamblers at the casino and rowers and canoers at the Olympic Basin. During the coldest part of winter, ice skaters use the basin as a rink. City workers clear the snow from its icy surface as part of the annual winter festival, \\"La F√™te des Neiges de Montr√©al\\". However, the ice rink was located on Saint Helen's Island, close to the Jean-Drapeau metro station, the past few years. Cross-country skiers and snowshoers can also tour the area. Circuit Gilles Villeneuve Each summer, Notre-Dame Island's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve hosts the Canadian Grand Prix Formula One race and used to host the NAPA Auto Parts 200 of NASCAR's Nationwide Series (now known as the Xfinity Series). The Circuit, opened in 1978, is accessible to the public when it is not being used for motorsports.

It is located on a peninsula five kilometres to the east of the city centre, on the shore of the WaitematƒÅ Harbour, which lies to the north, and Hobson Bay and Orakei Basin, two arms of the WaitematƒÅ, which lie to the west and south. To the east is the suburb of Mission Bay. The mouth of the WaitematƒÅ is to the immediate north of Orakei, lying between Bastion Point, in Orakei, and North Head, in Devonport on the North Shore. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"place of adornment\\" for . The suburb achieved national attention in 1977 when MƒÅori protestors occupied vacant land at Bastion Point. Land which had formerly belonged to the NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua iwi had been acquired cheaply for public works many decades before, and members of the tribe occupied the land demanding its return. The site was largely returned to the iwi after a long and not entirely bloodless occupation. Orakei is home to some of Auckland's most expensive real estate. Paritai Drive in Orakei is generally regarded as the most expensive street in Auckland, and most probably New Zealand. House prices on this street start at $3m and range to $12m. The local secondary school is Selwyn College. Bastion Point is the location of the Savage Memorial, the tomb and memorial garden for Michael Joseph Savage, the first Labour Party prime minister of New Zealand and one of the country's most popular prime ministers, who died in office in 1940. This magnificent Art Deco ensemble by Tibor Donner and Anthony Bartlett was officially opened in March 1943 and affords remarkable views of the Waitemata Harbour.

Along with Alan Prince, he developed Optimality Theory, a representational model of linguistics. Optimality Theory is popularly used for phonology, the subfield to which it was originally applied, but has been extended to other areas of linguistics such as syntax and semantics. Smolensky is the recipient of the 2005 Rumelhart Prize for his pursuit of the ICS Architecture, a model of cognition that aims to unify Connectionism and symbolism, where the symbolic representations and operations are manifested as abstractions on the underlying connectionist networks. Among his other important ideas is the notion of local conjunction of constraints - the idea that two constraints can combine into a single constraint that is violated only when both of its conjuncts are violated. Local conjunction has been applied to the analysis of various \\"super-additive\\" effects in Optimality Theory. With Bruce Tesar (Rutgers University), Smolensky has also contributed significantly to the study of the learnability of Optimality Theoretic grammars.

The car was initially sold under the Austin marque as the Austin 1800, then by Morris as the Morris 1800, by Wolseley as the Wolseley 18/85, and later the Austin 2200, Morris 2200 and Wolseley Six. The 1800 was voted European Car of the Year for 1965. Development The Austin 1800 was developed at BMC as a larger follow-up to the successful Mini and Austin 1100 under the ADO17 codename, ADO being an abbreviation for Amalgamated Drawing Office. Additional badge-engineered Morris 1800 and Wolseley 18/85 variants were launched in 1966 and 1967 respectively, catering for the BMC dealerships selling those marques. The 18/85 name had previously been used on the Wolseley 18/85 of 1938 to 1948. The car was unconventional in its appearance in 1964, with its large glasshouse and spacious, minimalist interior including leather, wood, and chrome features plus an unusual instrument display with ribbon speedometer and green indicator light on the end of the indicator stalk. There was a chrome \\"umbrella handle\\" handbrake under the dashboard parcel shelf, and the two front seats met in the middle and could be used, on occasion, as a bench seat. Both Alec Issigonis and Pininfarina worked on its exterior. The technology \\"under the skin\\" was also unconventional and ahead of its time, including Hydrolastic suspension and an example of inertia-controlled brake proportioning, in the form of a valve which transferred braking force between front and rear axles as a function of sensed deceleration rather than as a function of fluid pressure. An interesting feature was a tail/brake/indicator night dipping system. A resistance circuit was connected in such a way so that when the sidelight circuit was energised the resistors dimmed the tail/brake/indicator lights so not to blind or dazzle following drivers. The bodyshell was exceptionally stiff with a torsional rigidity of 18032 Nm/degree.\\"Austin 1800\\". Automobile Engineer. December 1964 Progressive improvement was a feature of most cars in this period, but the number and nature of the changes affecting the early years of the Austin 1800 looked to some as though the car had been introduced with insufficient development. In December 1964, a month after its launch, reclining front seats and the option of an arm rest in the middle of the back seat were added to the specification schedule. A month later, in January 1965, the final drive ratio reverted to the 3.88:1 value used in the prototype, from the 4.2:1 ratio applied at launch: this was described as a response to \\"oil-consumption problems\\". The same month also saw the indicator switch modified. At the same time, higher gearing and reduced valve clearances cut the published power output by 2 bhp but cured the \\"valve-crash\\" reported by some buyers when approaching top speed on one of Britain's recently constructed motorways. The manufacturer quietly replaced the \\"flexible, flat-section dipstick\\" which, it was said, had caused inattentive owners to overfill the sump after inserting the dipstick back-to- front so that the word \\"Oil\\" could not be seen on it. Subsequent modifications included changing, repositioning and re-angling the handbrake in October 1965, removing the rear anti-roll bar and rearranging the rear suspension at the end of 1965, at the same time adjusting the steering to address a problem of tyre scuffing, and fitting stronger engine side covers in January 1966 along with modified engine-mounting rubbers which now were \\"resistant to de-bonding\\". February 1965 saw water shields fitted to the rear hubs and the car's steering rattle cured by the judicious fitting of a spacer, while the propensity of early cars to jump out of first and second gears was addressed by the fitting of a \\"synchroniser\\". Further improvements followed the launch of the Morris 1800 early in 1966. Gear cables were revamped to deal with \\"difficult engagement\\" of first and third gears in cold weather, and the seat mountings were adapted to increase rake in May 1966. In June 1967, without any fanfare or press releases, a modified version of the 1800 started arriving in dealerships with repositioned heater controls, a strip of 'walnut veneer' on the fascia and separate bucket seats replacing the former split bench seat at the front. Various other criticisms seem to have been quietly addressed at the same time, including more highly geared steering which now needed only 3.75 rather than 4.2 turns between locks, although the actual modification had applied to cars produced since September 1966 (and, in the case of Australian cars, some time before that). This was also the point at which the car received a differently calibrated dipstick, giving rise to rumours that engine problems on some of the early models had resulted from nothing more complicated than the wrong calibration of the dipstick, causing the cars to run with the wrong level of engine oil; the manufacturer insisted that the \\"recalibration\\" of the dipstick was one of several (unspecified) modifications, and urged owners not to use the new dipsticks with older engines. A nickname of 'Landcrab' was given to the car by some car enthusiasts, derived from the car's unusual proportions, being much wider and lower than most other cars in its class. The car's successful use in endurance rallies came about because, while it was never a particularly fast car, its strong bodyshell and sophisticated suspension allowed it to reliably maintain competitive average speeds over long distances on poor roads. The car's stance, strength and slow-but-sure nature over rough ground put the BMC rally crews in mind of a terrestrial crab. The nickname stuck and then became widespread in the press and public. The Mark I's doors were later used on the Austin Maxi and larger Austin 3-Litre model. File:Austin 1800 in W-wa blue f.jpgAustin 1800 (Mark I) File:Austin 1800 in W-wa blue r.jpg =Mark II= In May 1968, a Mark II version was launched. This featured a cheaper and more conventional interior, revised front grilles and other trim, and for the Austin and Morris models the slim, horizontal rear lights were replaced by vertical \\"fin\\" lights which gave a family look along with the smaller ADO16 range. The Wolseley retained its unique rear lights. Other changes included a higher second gear and final drive ratio for the manual transmission, and conventional suspension bushes replaced the far superior roller bearings fitted to the Mark I. The compression ratio was increased and maximum power output boosted by 5 bhp to a claimed 86 bhp. The Mark II also had larger wheels.Sedgewick p144 In 1969, the sills and doors from the 1800 (with Mark II exterior handles) were used on the bodyshell of the otherwise new Austin Maxi; apart from that, both models have little interchangeability. The 1800S twin carburettor 95 bhp engine came in from October 1968. By 1970, a \\"S\\" model with twin SU HS6 carburettors, a 120 mph speedometer and sporty-looking badging was available.

This had another change to the front grille (now a shared style for the Austin and Morris) and interior improvements, including a conventional floor-mounted handbrake. At this point, six-cylinder versions were introduced ‚Äì the Austin 2200, Morris 2200 and Wolseley Six. While 1800 versions of the Austin and Morris were continued, the Wolseley 18/85 was dropped.

The British 6-cylinder models were marketed as the Austin 2200, Morris 2200 and Wolseley Six. The ubiquitous doors even appeared on the further upmarket Austin 3-Litre of 1968 and, at prototype stage, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces. File:Austin 2200 Automatic.jpgAustin 2200 File:Wolseley Six Automatic 1972.jpgWolseley Six Sales Some 386,000 examples of all variants were produced in just over a decade, with the Austin-badged versions being the most common; some 221,000 units were produced. There were 95,271 Morris 1800 and 35,597 Wolseley 18/85Sedgewick p231 produced in the UK. Relatively few have survived outside the hands of enthusiasts owing to its original unfashionable image, and more recently, its popularity in the demolition derby and banger racing scenes, owing to the bodyshell's exceptional strength and rigidity. In early 1975, all three models were replaced by the wedge-shaped ADO71, or 18‚Äì22 series, which bore the Austin and Morris (1800 and 2200) names, while the Wolseley variant had no official model name save for being marketed as \\"the Wolseley saloon\\". From late 1975 all ADO71 models were marketed under the Princess name and the Wolseley marque was discontinued. Motor sport The \\"BMC 1800\\" which placed second in the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon The model proved a strong competitor in endurance rallying, finishing second in the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon and achieving three of the top 20 positions in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally. In later life, the ADO17 became a popular car for competing in banger racing and in demolition derbies, owing to the bodyshell's strength, which made it ideal for those sports. Australia =Austin 1800= By 1966 Australia was described as BMC's leading world market. The 1800 was introduced in Australia in November 1965 as the Austin 1800, with a Mark II version being introduced in 1968. Australian-produced vehicles started out with a claimed local content of 65‚Äì70%, along with an undertaking from the manufacturers to raise the level to 95% in line with government requirements by the end of 1968. Initially the cars were generally identical to their British contemporaries; however, the local production was quickly modified to suit the harsher roads and climate of Australia. Modifications to the British Mark I design included raised suspension trim height, the provision of a large, heavy sump guard, and better sealing against dust. The Australian Mark II was notable in retaining the lower final drive ratio of the Mark I's manual transmission (but not the lower second gear), and, with the exception of the initial production run, was fitted with a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system manufactured locally by Paton's Brake Replacements (PBR) Pty. Ltd. Despite offering the safety of a dual-circuit system, it was generally held to be inferior in performance to the earlier Girling equipment. The Australian Mark II was also originally fitted with an alternator manufactured locally by Electricity Meter & Allied Industries Limited (EMAIL), a company better known for its kilowatt-hour meters and household appliances. In the event of failure, most EMAIL alternators were replaced by Australian-made Lucas units. A version unique to Australia was the Austin 1800 Utility, a coupe utility produced from 1968 to 1971.Austin 1800 Utility at www.aronline.co.uk Retrieved on 24 February 2011 Over 2,000 examples were built. The Utility was released near the end of the first series in July 1968 and most of the examples produced were therefore Mk IIs.Larry O'Toole, The Good Old Aussie Ute, 2000, page 215 A cab chassis variant was also offered.In pursuit of trivia, www.bluestreaksix.com Retrieved on 14 July 2014 The 1800 Utility was given the model code YDO10.Building Cars in Australia, 2012, page 78 Per capita, the Australian model sold better than anywhere else in the world. Ironically, it represented the tail-end of the popularity of British-designed cars in Australia. In the Australian market, it offered a roomy and advanced 4-cylinder alternative to the popular 6-cylinder models such as the Holden Kingswood, which used conventional engineering based on American principles. Some versions badged BMC Freeway (a name previously used for a six-cylinder Farina model in Australia) were exported to New Zealand, which also assembled UK-made Austin and Morris 1800s in separate plants. As a one-off engineering prototype, to test production viability, an Australian 1800 Mark II body with subtly extended front guards and modified front internal structure was fitted with an early Rover 3.5 litre V8 mounted in the \\"North-South\\" position in the engine bay and then through a complex mechanical system, drove a heavily modified version of an \\"East-West\\"-mounted Borg Warner 3-speed automatic gearbox and Austin FWD differential. This car became Australia‚Äôs first locally-made FWD V8 car. The car was built by BLMC (Australia) at its Victoria Park works at Zetland, New South Wales. Mass production costs and general viability of the V8 \\"1800\\" were felt to be excessive, and the project was shelved, preference being given to the Australian Leyland P76 project. Some reports state that the vehicle was eventually shipped to British Leyland in the UK and never seen again, while others claim it was simply broken up at the end of its testing by Leyland Australia. =Austin X6 Tasman & Kimberley= In 1970, the Australian subsidiary of BL replaced the 1800 with the modified and facelifted \\"X6\\" models known as the Austin Tasman and the more upmarket Austin Kimberley. These cars featured new front and rear styling and a 2.2-litre 6-cylinder version of the E series OHC four-cylinder engine (becoming one of the first front-wheel-drive cars with a transversely mounted \\"inline\\" six- cylinder engine). Both models had an updated dashboard and interior but retained the \\"bus\\"-like steering wheel position and gearshift approach from the 1800. The MkI Kimberly had a higher power engine fitted with twin SU carburettors (MkII‚Äôs reverted to single carburettors like the Tasman). The X6 series was intended to compete more effectively with the Australian-assembled rear-wheel drive six-cylinder family cars of GM Holden, Ford and Chrysler Australia. Both of the Austin cars were offered with either 4-speed manuals or a 3-speed automatic. Mark II versions of both X6 models were introduced in 1971.Building Cars in Australia, 2012, page 217 The X6 Tasman and Kimberley models were given a model designation code of YDO13 with the Mark II models coded YDO19.Building Cars in Australia, 2012, pages 216 & 217 Despite their technical superiority, updated styling, good ride, comfort, interior space and adequate power the \\"X6\\" series were somewhat underdeveloped due to a limited budget and so became ultimately commercially inferior to their competitors ‚Äì eventually being superseded by the Leyland P76 in 1973. Local distributor New Zealand Motor Corporation initially imported the Australian Tasman and Kimberley models from Zetland, but later assembled most of its stock from CKD kits at its Petone plant near Wellington. The Kiwi cars had different interior trim materials as part of the 40-50% local parts content common at the time but otherwise differed only in detail from Australian made cars. They were, however, sold as Morris models instead of Austin. The Australian-developed 2.2 E6 was also used in UK-built 2200 models Eventually, by 1973, Leyland Australia had modified the L6 engine and extended the stroke of the 2200 motor to 2600 cc for final use in the Leyland P76 and L6 Marina models.

The sleek design previewed the Citroen CX by some seven years. The car was evaluated by BMC, and Pininfarina developed a further smaller model based on the BMC ADO16 model, but the design was not taken up by the then merged British Leyland. This was after BMC had investigated a Mini shaped version. The 1800 version was however used by chief engineer Harry Webster and was know within the Austin Morris division as the Yellow Peril.

The band originally featured Mark Sandman on \\"low guitar,\\" Billy Conway on cocktail drum, David Champagne on guitar, and Jim Fitting on harmonica. Singing and songwriting duties were shared by all but Conway. Champagne and Fitting reformed the band in 2009 with new members Steve Mayone and Billy Beard. Treat Her Right was the forerunner to the successful indie rock band Morphine. Critic Ira Robbins described Treat Her Right as \\"[n]ot quite a blues band, not exactly swamp trash and too stylized for basic rock'n'roll.\\" The Rough Guide to Rock later used the label \\"punk-blues\\" to describe the band. However, \\"punk\\" was not a characteristic associated with the band while it was active. Sandman stated the band's aesthetic: \\"Keep it simple at all costs. Resist the temptation to add. If you're going to do something to a song, subtract.\\" History =Career (1985‚Äì1991)= The band derived its name from the 1965 international smash hit by Roy Head and the Traits, \\"Treat Her Right.\\" Their instrumentation was unusual, with Sandman's \\"low guitar\\" mimicking a bass guitar and Conway eschewing a full drum kit. Conway later observed, \\"When we started that band, one of the parameters was that everyone had to be able to carry their equipment into the gig in one trip. We wanted to keep things small and simple.\\" From the beginning, the band espoused a \\"back to basics\\" approach. Champagne said the idea was to start with the same building materials as the Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin, but to come up with something of their own. A key factor was leaving much space in the music, which came about by circumstances as well as design. Soon after forming, the band got a gig at The Plough and Stars, a small bar in Cambridge whose owner wouldn't let them bring in drums, so Conway played a railing and stamped a trap door to the kitchen. Not long afterward, he acquired the cocktail drum. They intentionally wanted not to have a big kick-snare drum, which at the time was pervasive in rock music production. The group's self-financed and self- titled debut was released on a small Boston record label in 1986 before being issued in the UK by Demon Records. The group signed to RCA Records, which reissued the debut in the United States. Their first recording attempt was a modest success ‚Äì Champagne's \\"I Got a Gun\\" and Sandman's cover of James Blood Ulmer's \\"Where Did All the Girls Come From?\\" received some play on college radio. \\"I Think She Likes Me\\" describes Sandman's experience in a Fairplay, Colorado bar where a woman came on to him. Critic John Dugan described the debut as \\"slick, intelligent, sly, and well worth your while.\\" Tied to the Tracks was issued in 1989. Sales did not meet RCA's expectations. In the notes for their third record, the group wrote, \\"RCA decided that if our little basement tape could do so well, why not spend fifty times more money and it will be fifty times better! (They think everything works like that.)\\" Treat Her Right were dropped from their RCA contract. What's Good for You, their third album, was issued on Rounder Records in 1991. The ragged, live-in-the- studio sound was partly inspired by the model established by Chess Records, which had released many classic blues and early rock and roll records. Shortly after this third release, Treat Her Right disbanded. =Other projects and post-breakup= Fitting later played with The The, The Coots and Session Americana. Champagne remained musically active, playing with groups such as The Jazz Popes. Sandman formed Morphine in 1989, which Conway joined in 1993. Although more blues-based than Morphine, Treat Her Right sowed the seeds of Sandman's later sound with its unusual instrumentation (Sandman's guitar with Treat Her Right was a three string custom model, making it sound more like a bass guitar) and slightly dark focus, most evident on the Sandman-penned songs. Sandman died of a heart attack while onstage with Morphine in Italy in 1999. In 2004, Sandbox: The Mark Sandman Box Set was released. The 2-CD/1-DVD compilation was culled from Sandman's personal archive. It included several Treat Her Right songs, although for some unknown reason, Jim Fitting's name did not appear in the credits. =Reformation (2009‚Äì2011)= The Treat Her Right song \\"Rhythm & Booze\\" was featured on The Hangover soundtrack, released in 2009. That same year, The Lost Album, a record of unreleased Treat Her Right material, was released by Hi-n-Dry. Shortly thereafter, Treat Her Right reunited to mark the ten-year anniversary of Sandman's death at the Mark Sandman Memorial Concert in September, and the band continued activity. Champagne and Fitting led the new version of Treat Her Right, joined by Steve Mayone playing low guitar and Billy Beard (previously of the Boston new wave band Face to Face) playing drums. This incarnation of the band played some gigs in the Boston area, of which the latest appears to have been in 2011. Fitting then devoted his efforts to Session Americana, which had become more active again. = Billy, Jimmy, & Dave (2019‚Äì)= In 2019, Conway, Fitting, and Champagne recorded an album. A live date was announced for January 19, 2020 at Club Passim in Cambridge -- their first appearance together on stage since all were members of Treat Her Right.Club Passim website Conway was unable to participate due to health issues, with Larry Dersch and Jerome Deupree filling in on drums.

Kinnikinnick (First Nations for \\"smoking mixture\\") is a common name in Canada and the United States. It is one of several related species referred to as bearberry. Its specific name uva-ursi means \\"grape of the bear\\" in Latin (), similar to the meaning of the generic epithet Arctostaphylos (\\"bear grapes\\"). Etymology and common names The genus name of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi comes from the Greek words arctos (meaning bear) and staphyle (meaning \\"bunch of grapes\\") in reference to the fruits which form grape-like clusters. In the wild, the fruits are commonly eaten by bears. The specific epithet, uva-ursi, comes from the Latin words uva (meaning grape) and ursus (bear), reflected by the bearberry nickname. The common name, kinnikinnick, is an Algonquin word meaning \\"smoking mixture\\". Native Americans and early pioneers smoked the dried uva-ursi leaves and bark alone or mixed with other herbs, tobacco or dried dogwood bark in pipes. Numerous common names exist, depending on region, such as mealberry, sandberry, mountain-box, fox-plum, hog-crawberry, and barren myrtle.  Distribution  The distribution of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is circumpolar, and it is widespread in northern latitudes, but confined to high altitudes further south: * in Europe, from Iceland and North Cape, Norway south to southern Spain (Sierra Nevada); central Italy (Apennines) and northern Greece (Pindus mountains); * in Asia from arctic Siberia south to Turkey, the Caucasus, the Levant and the Himalaya; * in North America from arctic Alaska, Canada and Greenland, south to California, north coast, central High Sierra Nevada (above Convict Lake, Mono County, California), Central Coast, California, San Francisco Bay Area, to New Mexico in the Rocky Mountains; and the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast United States. It is prevalent across all regions of British Columbia and Alberta. The plant is rare or endangered in several states of the Midwestern United States. Description Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is a small procumbent woody groundcover shrub high. The leaves are evergreen, remaining green for 1‚Äì3 years before falling. The fruit is a red berry. The leaves are shiny, small, and feel thick and stiff. They are alternately arranged on the stems. Undersides of leaves are lighter green than on the tops. New stems can be red if the plant is in full sun, but are green in shadier areas. Older stems are brown. In spring, they have white or pink flowers. Wild stands of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi can be dense, with heights rarely taller than 6 inches. Erect branching twigs emerge from long flexible prostrate stems, which are produced by single roots. The trailing stems will layer, sending out small roots periodically. The finely textured velvety branches are initially white to pale green, becoming smooth and red- brown with maturity. The small solitary three-scaled buds are dark brown. The simple leaves of this broadleaf evergreen are alternately arranged on branches. Each leaf is held by a twisted leaf stalk, vertically. The leathery dark green leaves are an inch long and have rounded tips tapering back to the base. In fall, the leaves begin changing from a dark green to a reddish-green to purple, becoming pale on the underside. Terminal clusters of small urn- shaped flowers bloom from May to June. The flowers are white to pink, and bear round, fleshy or mealy, bright red to pink fruits called drupes. The smooth, glossy skinned fruits range from in diameter. The fruit persist on the plant into early winter. The fruits are bittersweet when raw, but sweeter when boiled and dried. Fruits are edible for humans, but are generally considered to be unpalatable. Each drupe contains 1 to 5 hard seeds, which need to be scarified and stratified prior to germination to reduce the seed coat and break embryo dormancy. There is an average of 40,900 cleaned seeds per pound. It is a fire-tolerant species and may be a seedbanking species. Bears and other animals eat the berries. Pathology Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is an alternate host for spruce broom rust. Subspecies There are some 14 subspecies, including: * Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. uva-ursi. Common bearberry; circumpolar arctic and subarctic, and in mountains further south. * Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. adenotricha. Central high Sierra Nevada. * Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. coactilis. North coastal California, central coast California, San Francisco Bay Area. * Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. cratericola . Guatemala bearberry, endemic to Guatemala at very high altitudes (3000-4000 m). * Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. longifoliosa. Various reports from Canada, U.S.A. May be the same as adenotricha or coactilis. For a list of reported North American subspecies and varietals, see USDA Plants Profile. Uses =Phytochemicals= The plant contains diverse phytochemicals, including ursolic acid, tannic acid, gallic acid, some essential oils and resin, hydroquinones (mainly arbutin, up to 17%), tannins (up to 15%), phenolic glycosides and flavonoids. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi leaves contain arbutin, which metabolizes to form hydroquinone, a potential liver toxin. =Food= Historically, bearberry fruits and leaves were used by the Blackfeet Nation as food. The fruits can be used to make jelly. The berries were used as seasoning and cooked with meat. =Dye= Native Americans used the plant to make yellow dye. =Smoking= Dried bearberry leaves are the main component in many traditional North American Native smoking mixes, known collectively as \\"kinnikinnick\\" (Algonquin for \\"smoking mixture\\") used especially among western First Nations, often including other herbs and sometimes tobacco. =Traditional medicine= Teas and extracts of the leaves have been used in traditional medicine of First Nations people over centuries as urinary tract antiseptics, diuretics, and laxatives. In herbalism, leaf tea is used to treat urinary tract inflammation. Though thought to be an astringent or cure for sexually transmitted diseases, as of 2017, there was no high-quality evidence from clinical research that such treatments are effective or safe. =Precautions and adverse effects= One review indicated that ingestion of large doses can cause allergic reactions, with nausea and seizures, as a potential emergency condition. Preliminary studies indicate that arbutin may be toxic when ingested in high doses. Uva ursi may cause adverse effects in people with liver or kidney disease, or pregnant and breastfeeding women. =Cultivation= There are several cultivars that are propagated for use as ornamental plants. It is an attractive year-round evergreen groundcover for gardens, and is useful for controlling erosion on hillsides and slopes due to its deep roots. It is tolerant of sun and dry soils, and is thus common groundcover in urban areas, in naturalized areas, and in native plant or rock gardens.

He published 17 novels, and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times, winning once for the 1992 novel Sacred Hunger. Biography Unsworth was born on 10 August 1930Some sources say 8 August in Wingate, a mining village in County Durham, England, to a family of miners. His father first entered the mines at age 12 and ordinarily Unsworth would have followed him as a miner. However, when his father was 19, he travelled to the United States for a few years and on returning to Britain entered the insurance business and thus began moving his family up the economic ladder and out of the mines. \\"He rescued my brother and me from that long chain of continuity that happens in mining villages,\\" Unsworth said. He graduated from the University of Manchester in 1951, and lived in France for a year teaching English. He also travelled extensively in Greece and Turkey during the 1960s, lecturing at the University of Athens and the University of Istanbul. His novels about fin-de-siecle Ottoman Empire, The Rage of the Vulture and Pascali's Island, were inspired by these experiences. He published his first novel in 1966, his second novel, The Greeks Have a Word For It, was an outgrowth of his teaching experience in Athens. In 1999 he was a visiting professor at the University of Iowa's Iowa Writers' Workshop. In 2004 he taught literature and creative writing classes at Kenyon College in Ohio. In the last years of his life, he lived in Perugia, a city in the Umbria region of Italy, with his second wife, a Finnish national. His novel After Hannibal is a fictionalised description of his efforts at settlement in the Italian countryside. Unsworth died in Perugia, Italy in 2012, of lung cancer.Fox, Margalit (7 June 2012) Barry Unsworth, Writer of Historical Fiction, Dies at 81 The New York Times. Retrieved 8 June 2012 He was 81. Unsworth died the same day as Ray Bradbury; as Cynthia Crossen said in the Wall Street Journal, \\"Mr. Bradbury invented the future; Mr. Unsworth invented the past.\\" Work Unsworth's first novel, The Partnership, was published in 1966 when he was 36. \\"...in my earlier novels, especially the two written in the early '70s, The Hide and Mooncranker's Gift, there was a baroque quality in the style, a density. The mood was grim, but the language was more figurative and more high-spirited. There was more delight in it, more self-indulgence, too. Among my earliest influences as a writer were the American novelists of the deep south, especially Eudora Welty, and some of that elated, grotesque comedy stayed with me.\\" Mooncranker's Gift (1973) won the Heinemann Award). Other novels included Stone Virgin (1985) and Losing Nelson (1999). In addition to Eudora Welty, he counted William Faulkner and Carson McCullers as his major influences. Unsworth did not start to write historical fiction until his sixth novel, Pascali's Island (1980), the first of his novels to be shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Pascali's Island is set on an unnamed Aegean island during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. Reflecting on this shift, Unsworth explained: \\"Nowadays I go to Britain relatively rarely and for short periods; in effect, I have become an expatriate. The result has been a certain loss of interest in British life and society and a very definite loss of confidence in my ability to register the contemporary scene there ‚Äì the kind of things people say, the styles of dress, the politics etc.‚Äì with sufficient subtlety and accuracy. So I have turned to the past. The great advantage of this, for a writer of my temperament at least, is that one is freed from a great deal of surface clutter. One is enabled to take a remote period and use it as a distant mirror (to borrow Barbara Tuchman‚Äôs phrase), and so try to say things about our human condition ‚Äì then and now ‚Äì which transcend the particular period and become timeless.\\" A film version directed by James Dearden, starring Charles Dance, Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, as the title character, was released in 1988. Morality Play, shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1995, is a murder mystery set in 14th century England about a travelling troupe of players that put on Bible plays. It was adapted as a film, The Reckoning (2003), starring Paul Bettany and Willem Dafoe. Sacred Hunger (1992) centres on the Atlantic slave trade that moves from Liverpool to West Africa, Florida and the West Indies. It was joint winner of the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1992, along with Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient. It is generally considered his masterpiece. The story is set in the mid-18th century and centres around the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship employed in the triangular trade, a central trade route in the Atlantic slave trade. The two main characters are cousins Erasmus Kemp, son of a wealthy merchant from Lancashire, and Matthew Paris, a physician and scientist who goes on the voyage. The novel's central theme is greed, with the subject of slavery being a primary medium for exploring how selfish desire for profit can result in evil and barbarism. The \\"sacred hunger\\" of the title refers to the profit motive. The story line has a very extensive cast of characters, some featuring in only one scene, others continually developed throughout the story, but most described in intricate detail. The narrative interweaves elements of appalling cruelty and horror with extended comedic interludes, and employs frequent period expressions. A sequel, The Quality of Mercy, was published in 2011, it was his last book. Sugar and Rum (1988) was a novel set in contemporary Liverpool about a writer who is trying to write a novel about the Liverpool slave trade, and who is suffering from writer's block; Unsworth wrote this novel to try to get over his own block during the writing of Sacred Hunger. Style Unsworth's style is not heaped in historical minutiae, \\"I don't really care how many buttons someone had on his waistcoat. It would be good to get it right, but what really matters is trying to get hold of the spirit of the age, what it was like to be alive in that age, what it felt like to be‚Ä¶an ordinary person in the margins of history.\\" On writing and growing old, Unsworth said, \\"With time I have grown more sparing with the words. I think less of fire-works and flourishes. I try to get warmth and colour through precision of language. This is more difficult, I think, which may be why I find writing novels so challenging and exacting.\\" Some critics have attacked historical fiction as being un-literary, for example James Wood writing in The New Yorker called it a \\"somewhat gimcrack genre not exactly jammed with greatness.\\" However Unsworth defended the form, saying \\"The term historical fiction is a blunt instrument in literary criticism. When people ask, 'Is it a good historical novel?' they may as well ask, 'Is it a good Protestant novel?' or 'Is it a good transvestite novel?' I write stories that are set in the past. Fiction set in the past should be judged by the same criteria as any other fiction. Does the novel convey a sense of life, touch the reader's mind and heart? Does it belong to what D.H. Lawrence called the one bright book of life?\\" Awards and honours * 1973 Heinemann Award, Mooncranker's GiftObituary: Barry Unsworth, The Times, London, 9 June 2012, page 81 * 1980 Booker Prize, shortlist, Pascali's Island * 1992 Booker Prize, co-winner, Sacred Hunger * 1995 Booker Prize, shortlist, Morality Play * 2006 Booker Prize, longlist, The Ruby in Her Navel * 2012 Walter Scott Prize, shortlist, The Quality of Mercy List of works ;Novels * The Partnership (1966) * The Greeks Have a Word For It (1967) * The Hide (1970) * Mooncranker's Gift (1973) * The Big Day (1976) * Pascali's Island (1980) (US edition first published as The Idol Hunter) * The Rage of the Vulture (1982) * Stone Virgin (1985) * Sugar and Rum (1988) * Sacred Hunger (1992) * Morality Play (1995) * After Hannibal (1996) * Losing Nelson (1999) * The Songs of the Kings (2002) * The Ruby in Her Navel (2006) * Land of Marvels (2009) * The Quality of Mercy (2011) ;Nonfiction * Crete (2004) References External links * Audio recordings from Key West Literary Seminar, 2009: Unsworth reading from Land of Marvels  'The Economy of Truth' (lecture)  'Why Bother with the Past?'

However, some were also built in Spain by Authi, in Italy by Innocenti and at the company's own plant in Belgium. It was the basis for locally adapted similar cars manufactured in Australia and South Africa. Various versions including Austin, Morris, MG, Wolseley and Riley were assembled in New Zealand and Malta from CKD kits from 1963 until the final Austin/Morris versions were discontinued in 1974, a year after the launch of its replacement, the Austin Allegro. The vehicle was launched as the Morris 1100 on 15 August 1962. The range was expanded to include several rebadged versions, including the twin-carburettor MG 1100 (introduced at the end of September 1962), the Austin 1100 (August 1963),Austin.

The Morris badged 1100/1300 models were discontinued on the launch of the Morris Marina in 1971, but the Austin and Vanden Plas versions remained in production in the UK until June 1974. The three-door estate version followed in 1966, called Countryman in the Austin version and Traveller in the Morris one, continuing the established naming scheme. The Austin 1100 Countryman appeared in the Fawlty Towers episode \\"Gourmet Night\\", in which the short-tempered owner of Fawlty Towers Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) gave it a \\"damn good thrashing\\". This episode was first shown in October 1975. In 1964 the 1100 was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year. For most of its production life, the ADO16 was Britain's best selling car. Design and development The ADO16 (Amalgamated Drawing Office project number 16) was designed by Alec Issigonis. Following his success with the Mini, Issigonis set out to design a larger and more sophisticated car which incorporated more advanced features and innovations. Pininfarina, the Italian styling studio that had worked with BMC before on the Austin A40 Farina, was commissioned to style the car. ADO16 had comparable interior space to the larger Ford Cortina. In common with the Mini, the ADO16 was designed around the BMC A-Series engine, mounted transversely and driving the front wheels. As well as single piston swinging caliper disc brakes at the front, which were not common on mass-produced cars in the early 1960s, the ADO16 featured a Hydrolastic interconnected fluid suspension system designed by Alex Moulton. The mechanically interconnected Citroen 2CV suspension was assessed in the mid-1950s by Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton (according to an interview by Moulton with CAR magazine in the late 1990s), and was an inspiration in the design of the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the tyres in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. BMC engineer Charles Griffin took over development work from Issigonis at the end of the 1950s while Issigonis completed work on the Mini. Griffin ensured the 1100 had high levels of refinement, comfort and presentation. Griffin would later have overall responsibility for the Princess, Metro, Maestro and Montego ranges.Obituary. Charles Griffin, The Times, Friday, 26 November 1999; pg. 31; Issue 66682 Autocar reports in October 1973, while the car was still in production, that approximately 2,365,420 ADO16s had been produced.Autocar, Used Car Choice, BLMC 1100/1300, 4 October 1973 Mark I (1962‚Äì1967) The original Mark I models were distinctive for their use of a Hydrolastic suspension. Marketing material highlighted the spacious cabin when compared to competitor models which in the UK by 1964 included the more conservatively configured Ford Anglia, Vauxhall Viva and BMC's own still popular Morris Minor. Unlike almost all of its competitors, the AD016 featured front-wheel drive instead of the rear-wheel drive. The Mark I Austin / Morris 1100 was available, initially, only as a four-door saloon. In March 1966 a three-door station wagon became available, badged as the Morris 1100 Traveller or the Austin 1100 Countryman. Domestic market customers looking for a two-door saloon would have to await the arrival in 1967 of the Mark II version, although the two-door 1100 saloon had by now been introduced to certain oversea markets, including the United States where a two-door MG 1100 was offered. An Automotive Products (AP) four- speed automatic transmission was added as an option in November 1965. In order to avoid the serious levels of power loss then typical in small-engined cars with automatic transmission the manufacturers incorporated a new carburettor and a higher compression ratio in the new 1965 automatic transmission cars: indeed a press report of the time found very little power loss in the automatic 1100, though the same report expressed the suspicion that this might in part reflect the unusually high level of power loss resulting from the way in which the installation of the transversely mounted \\"normal\\" manual gear box had been engineered.

The new car combined the 1275 cc engine block already familiar to drivers of newer Mini Cooper S and Austin-Healey Sprite models with the 1100 transmission, its gear ratios remaining unchanged for the larger engine, but the final-drive being significantly more highly geared. The Mark II versions of the Austin and Morris models were announced, with the larger engine making it into these two makes' UK market ranges in October 1967 (as the Austin 1300 and Morris 1300). An 1100 version of the Mark II continued alongside the larger-engined models. Unusually for cars at this end of the market, domestic market waiting lists of several months accumulated for the 1300-engined cars during the closing months of 1967 and well into 1968. The manufacturers explained that following the devaluation of the British Pound in the Fall / Autumn of 1967 they were working flat out to satisfy export market demand, but impatient British would- be customers could be reassured that export sales of the 1300s were \\"going very well\\". MG, Wolseley, Riley and Vanden Plas variants with the 1300 engines were already available on the home market in very limited quantities, and Austin and Morris versions would begin to be \\"available here in small quantities in March 1968\\". The addition of a larger engined model to the ADO16 range came at a time when most cars of this size were now available with larger engines than the 1100 cc unit which until then had been the only engine available in the whole range. Its key rivals in the 1960s were the Vauxhall Viva (in HA form from 1963 and HB form from 1966) and the Ford Anglia (and from the end of 1967, the Anglia's successor, the Escort). From 1970, it had gained another fresh rival in the form of the HC Viva, and also from a new Rootes Group model, the Hillman Avenger. On the outside, a slightly wider front grille, extending a little beneath the headlights, and with a fussier detailing, differentiated Austin / Morris Mark IIs from their Mark I predecessors, along with a slightly smoother tail light fitting which also found its way onto the FX4 London taxi of the time. Austin and Morris grilles were again differentiated, the Austin having wavy bars and the Morris straight ones. The 1100 had been introduced with synchromesh on the top three ratios: all synchromesh manual gearboxes were introduced with the 1275 cc models at the end of 1967 and found their way into 1098 cc cars a few months later. Mark II versions of the MG, Riley, Vanden Plas and Wolseley were introduced in October 1968, at which time Riley abandoned the Kestrel name. The Riley 1300 Mark II was cancelled in July 1969, and signalled the demise of the Riley marque, proving to be a shade of things to come as the 1970s would see British Leyland discontinue the Wolseley marque and sell most of its model ranges under a solitary brand. At the London Motor Show in October 1969 the manufacturers introduced the Austin / Morris 1300 GT, featuring the same 1275 cc twin carburetter engine as that installed in the MG 1300, but with a black full width grill, a black vinyl roof and a thick black metal strip along the side. This was BMC's answer to the Ford Escort GT and its Vauxhall counterpart. Ride height on the Austin / Morris 1300 GT was fractionally lowered through the reduction of the Hydrolastic fluid pressure from 225 to 205 psi.

By the time the two millionth ADO16 was produced, at the end of June 1971, the Morris- badged version of the car had been withdrawn in order to create space in the range and in the showrooms for the Morris Marina. 1970 turned out to be the 1100/1300's last year at the top of the UK charts. Mark III (1971‚Äì1974) The Mark III models were introduced in September 1971. At the launch of the Morris 1100 in 1962 the manufacturer stated that they intended for the ADO16 models to remain in production for at least ten years, which despite BMC's vicissitudes through the 1960s turned out to be reasonably prescient. The range was gradually reduced, with the MG 1300 dropped in 1971 and the Wolseley 1300 in 1973. The final British ADO16, a Vanden Plas Princess 1300, left the factory on 19 June 1974. British Leyland replaced the ADO16 was replaced variously by the Austin Maxi (1969), the Morris Marina (1971), and the Austin Allegro (1973). The luxury Vanden Plas 1500 version of the Allegro debuted in 1975. By this time, its original rival, the Ford Cortina, had long since grown larger, putting ADO16 into the small, rather than medium-sized class, which British Leyland was now competing in with the Allegro, Austin Maxi, Morris Marina and Triumph Dolomite, as well as the long-running Austin 1800 saloons. The ADO16's final key rivals were the Ford Escort, Vauxhall Viva and Hillman Avenger.

During the Worboys Committee in the 1960s when the British road signage system was being redesigned, the silhouette of the ADO16 (since it was the UK's best selling car of the time) was used in many of the new road sign designs which are all still in use. ADO16 overseas The Austin Victoria was a Pamplona assembled ADO16, introduced in 1972 with a restyled front end and a lengthened rear luggage compartment. The car was sold with various names in different markets. In Spain it was sold as Morris, Austin and MG, starting production in the Pamplona Authi (Autom√≥viles de Turismo Hispano Ingleses) factory in 1966, and evolving by 1972 into the Austin Victoria. In Denmark the ADO16 bore the Morris Marina name from 1962 to 1972 - the same name as the British-built and better-known range of saloons produced in the British Leyland range from 1971 to 1980. The MG models were sold as the MG Sports Sedan there, as it was in North America from 1962, and was available with a two-door bodyshell that was unavailable in the UK until 1968. The Vanden Plas Princess was briefly the MG Princess 1100 in North America, while that market also saw an unusual two-door Austin 1100 (with a hybrid of Mark I and Mark II components). The ADO16 was not a strong seller in the Northern American markets - particularly in the USA where it was by far one of the smallest cars on sale. In the Netherlands the Austin version was sold as the Austin Glider. The Austin America was sold in the US, Canada and Switzerland between 1968 and 1972.

BMC 1100 Aerodinamica In 1967 Pininfarina unveiled at the Turin Motor Show a concept car based on the Landcrab called the BMC 1800 Aerodinamica. The sleek design previewed the Citroen CX by some seven years. The car was evaluated by BMC, and Pininfarina developed a further smaller model based on the BMC ADO16 model, but the design was not taken up by the then merged British Leyland. This was after BMC had investigated a Mini shaped version. The 1800 version was however used by chief engineer Harry Webster and was know within the Austin Morris division as the Yellow Peril.

History  During the early stages of World War II, General Simon Buckner commanded the defense of Alaska and was concerned they would be attacked by air. To protect the troops, General Buckner recommended a facility that was independent of local power plant, bomb-proof, and that had sufficient storage spaces. Whittier, Alaska was the perfect place to have this military base. First, the bay area around Whittier, Alaska has deep-water ports that stay ice-free year round. With Whittier being one of two all-weather railroad ports that supplied Anchorage with military necessities, it was important that it would stay functioning and safeguarded. Second, the almost constant cloud coverage would protect the facility from air strikes. = Annex = The Cold War triggered the United States Army Corps of Engineers to quickly build housing and recreational spaces for 1,000 soldiers moving to Whittier. The Composite Bachelor Housing Service and Recreation Center, also known as the Buckner Building, was completed in 1953. This combined building had a mess hall, sleeping quarters, movie theatre, bowling alley, small jail, and tunnels connecting the town of Whittier, Alaska. The building used to be one of the largest in Alaska, often being referred to as \\"the city under one roof\\". The building is six stories tall, about 500 feet long by 50‚Äì150 feet wide and is approximately 275,000 square feet. The building was cast in place by reinforced concrete on slate/ greywacke bedrock, 8,1. = Earthquake = In, 1964, Whittier, Alaska was hit by the 1964 Alaska earthquake that lasted about three minutes. A total of 13 people died in Whittier and damages to Federal and privately owned land would cost over $5 million. The Buckner Building was slightly damaged though it was minimized due to the foundation being on bedrock, as opposed to the majority of the town which rest on unconsolidated sediment and therefore received more damage. The Buckner Building also runs northeast-southwest, oblique to the seismic motion, decreasing the effect of the earthquake on the building. There was no structural damage to the building, and subsequent inspections found the building to be in good condition. = Decline = The building continued to operate until 1966, at which point the military pulled out and the Port of Whittier was transferred to the General Services Administration. After the military left, the ownership of the Buckner Building went through a handful of people. At one point, it was owned by one Pete Zamarillo who wanted to turn it into the state prison. In 1972 it was purchased by the citizens of the new City of Whittier and soon fell into disrepair. With the windows and doors missing, the elements began to take it over, water infiltrated, leaving the building in a constant state of freezing and thawing. In 2016 the building went into foreclosure and the city assumed ownership. There is now a fence around the building to keep trespassers out. The Whittier Department of Public Works and Public Utilities have done some work. The city would like to maintain it to preserve history but the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation recommends that the building be torn down.

As a leader of the Almohad Movement (since 1130), he became the first Caliph of the Almohad Empire (reigned 1147‚Äì63). Having put his predecessor's doctrinal blend of Zahirite jurisprudence and Ash'arite dogmatics into practice, Abd al-Mu'min's rule was the first to unite the whole coast from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean along with Spain under one creed and one government.Kojiro Nakamura, \\"Ibn Mada's Criticism of Arab Grammarians.\\" Orient, v. 10, pgs. 89-113. 1974 Between 1130 and his death in 1163, Abd al- Mu'min not only defeated the Almoravids, but extended his power over all northern Africa as far as Egypt, becoming Caliph of the Almohad Empire in 1147.  Early life  Abd al-Mu'min was born in the village of Tagra, Kingdom of the Hammadids, and belonged to the Kumiya tribe, which in turn, was part of the larger Berber Zenata tribe. This tribe settled in the north of what is now the province of Oran, not far from Nedroma. The Almohad biographers traced his descent as Abd al-Mu'min ben Ali ben Makhlouf ben Yali ben Merwan ben Nasr ben Ali ben Amer ben Al-Amir ben Musa ben Abdellah ben Yahya ben Ourigh ben Setfour (ben means son of). Ibn Khaldun, however, argued that this was a fabricated lineage, since Abd al-Mu'min was a Berber from a well known tribe and the names reported were, for the most part, Arab. While young, Abd al- Mu'min went to Tlemcen to learn the Fiqh. His tutor died before he could complete his study. He then was made aware of a learned and pious Faqih called Feqih Soussi (later known as Ibn Tumart) who was travelling from the east on his way to his native land in Tinmel, Morocco. Abd al-Mu'min and his peers wanted to convince Ibn Tumart to settle in Tlemcen, so he was sent to Ibn Tumart with a letter from the students inviting him to come to their land. The two met at Mellala near Beja√Øa. Ibn Tumart turned down the invitation, but Abd al-Mu'min stayed with him and they continued the journey together to Morocco.  Rise to power  Some time around 1117, he became a follower of Ibn Tumart, leader of the Masmudas (a Berber tribe of western Morocco), a religious and military leader of renowned piety who had founded the Almohads as a religious order with the goal of restoring purity in Islam. His group had long been at odds with the Almoravids and had been forced into exile in the mountains. He stayed with him as he journeyed slowly towards Marrakesh. It was there that his mentor declared himself the Mahdi (divinely guided one) and that he was opposed to the Almoravid Dynasty. After this pronouncement, the group moved to the Atlas Mountains and gathered followers there. In time they created a small Almohad state. During an attack on Marrakesh, al-Bashir the second in command, was killed and Abd al-Mu'min was named to that position. When Ibn Tumart died in 1128 at his Ribat in Tinmel, after suffering a severe defeat at the hands of the Almoravids, Abd al-Mu'min and the council of ten kept the death of Ibn Tumart secret for 3 years, since the Almohads were going through a difficult time in their fight against the Almoravids. He also feared that the Masmuda (the Berber tribe of Ibn Tumart) would not accept him as their leader since he was an outsider. He did eventually lead the Almohads when a family relationship was arranged between him and Cheikh Abu Hafs, the leader of the Masmuda. He then came forward as the lieutenant of Ibn Tumart, became the leader of the movement, and forged it into a powerful military force. Under him, the Almohads swept down from the mountains, eventually destroying the power of the faltering Almoravid dynasty by 1147. Abd al-Mu'min created his empire by first winning control of the high Atlas Mountains, then the Middle Atlas, into the Rif region, eventually moving into his homeland north of Tlemcen. In 1145, after the Almoravids lost the leader of their Catalan mercenaries, Reveter, the Almohads defeated them in open battle. From this point the Almohads moved west onto the Atlantic coastal plain. After laying siege to Marrakesh, they finally captured it in 1147. After the capture of Marrakesh, to quell any open rebellions, he ordered the elimination of 30,000 Almoravids in a purge. By establishing his capital at Marrakesh, Abd al-Mu'min created a dilemma in that the Almohads considered that it was a city of heretics. He contented himself with the destruction of their palace and all of their mosques. At this point he decided to concentrate his empire building on North Africa and expanded his empire beyond Morocco eastwards to the border of Egypt. By 1151, he had reached Constantine where he confronted a coalition of Arab tribes that had been marching through Berber lands. Rather than the destruction of these tribes, he utilized them in his next phase, Spain and also to quell any internal opposition from the family of Ibn Tumart. He reached the furthest east by 1158/9 by which time he had conquered Tunisia and Tripolitania. Conquests He asks and gets support from his father-in-law and has to rely on the support of his tribe of origin to protect his power and his quality of caliph. After consolidating his government, he decided to conquer the countries of eastern Maghreb, including Ifriqiya, then a prey to anarchy and part of which is under the yoke of the Normans of Sicily of King William the Evil, Put in difficulty by internal revolts and the rebellion of the governor Omar de Sfax. Abd al-Mumin invaded the territory of present-day Algeria, in 1152-1153, defeated the Arab-Muslim tribes who oppose its passage then defeats the Hammadid prince who reigns in Beja√Øa (Kabylie), and annex States. Seven years later, in 1159-1160, he seized Ifriqiya by defeating the Normans. On the 12th of July, 1159, he entered Tunis, while his fleet, of 70 ships, crossed the Gulf of Tunis; A delegation of notables of the city comes to meet the conqueror and solicits the aman; The caliph promised to respect the life and property of the present messengers, but demanded from the other inhabitants half of their property. His empire stretched as far as Tripoli and Andalusia, as far as the valley of the Guadalquivir: Granada, Cordoba and Seville thus fell into his hands. All that remains for him to do is to check the revolt of the Christians of Andalusia led by a certain Muhammad ibn Mardanis. Abd al-Mumin had his son Abu Yaqub Yusuf recognized as his heir and, with the help of the latter, had a fortress built on the left bank of the Bouregreg, opposite the town of Sale, to prepare the fleet destined to invade Spain . This fortress is called the \\"camp of victory\\" (Ribat El Fath), the future Rabat. Abd al-Mumin died in 1163 before he was able to complete his enterprise. During his reign he was supported by four principal viziers: Abu Jafar (1146-1157), Abu al-Salam (1157-1158), Abu Hafs (1158-1160) and Abu al-'Ala (1160-1163) .  Final years  The last years of Abd al-Mu'min's life were spent campaigning in the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia) first conquering the Muslim kingdoms and then campaigning inconclusively against the Christian states.  Legacy  Abd al-Mu'min was a prodigious builder of monuments and palaces. One of the monuments he caused to be erected was a substantial fortress at Chellah to prepare the site as a base for attacks against Iberia. He established a central government that would control North Africa for more than a half century after he died. He added to the traditional clan organizations of the Berbers the concept of Makhzan, a central administration staffed by Spanish Muslims. To keep the revenue flowing, he created a land registry. Abd al-Mu'min also supported the arts, but in keeping with the founders' wishes when mosques were built he kept them simple and plain. He is considered as a national hero in Algeria.

The film reflects on violence, morality, and the representation of violence in film, and touches especially on past colonialism and the current Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. It was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Notre musique received positive reviews from critics. Plot The film is divided into three parts inspired by the Divine Comedy of Dante. \\"Realm 1: Hell\\" is a relatively brief, non-narrative montage composed of appropriated documentary and narrative fictional footage depicting war, carnage, and violence. The second segment, \\"Realm 2: Purgatory\\", makes up the bulk of the film. Godard, playing himself, is waiting at the airport to depart to a European arts conference in Sarajevo. There he meets Ramos Garcia, a nationalized French Israeli, who is going to the conference as an interpreter. Ramos is looking forward to seeing his niece at the conference, Olga Brodsky, a French-speaking Jew of Russian descent. Another young woman at the conference, Judith Lerner, a journalist from Tel Aviv, visits the French ambassador and entreats him to have an on-the-record conversation about Jewish-Palestinian relations (\\"not a just conversation; just a conversation\\"). Later she interviews the poet Mahmoud Darwish, who says that the Palestinian struggle defines Israel. In between these encounters, Judith surveys the city, and visits the Mostar bridge, where she reads Emmanuel Levinas (Entre Nous). Meanwhile, Olga attends Godard's lecture, ostensibly about the relationship between image and text. In addition to touching on a variety of other topics, Godard explains his opposition to the common cinematic trope of \\"shot/reverse shot,\\" the cutting back and forth between two characters in a conversation or an exchange. Godard explains that presenting two characters in such a way, framed identically, regressively effaces their differences, and can be used as a tool of propaganda. Later Olga meets with her uncle Ramos, and discusses with him the philosophical problem of suicide. After the conference, Godard is back home, watering his garden. He gets a call from Ramos Garcia, who tells Godard about a young woman who ran into a theater and declared she had a bomb in her bag. She asked for one person to die with her for Israeli-Palestinian peace; everyone left the theater. The police came and shot her. When they opened her bag, all they found were books. Garcia tells Godard that he is sure it was Olga. In \\"Realm 3: Heaven,\\" a brief postlude, Olga wanders contemplatively through an idyllic lakeside setting that appears to be guarded by American marines. A part on the soundtrack of the movie is made by Meredith Monk, an American composer. Critical reception The film received generally positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 65% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 52 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 77 out of 100, based on 19 reviews.

In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes. The disease is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARŒ± or RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness, with a median survival time of less than a week. Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study. Signs and symptoms The symptoms tend to be similar to AML in general with the following being possible symptoms: * Anemia * Fatigue * Weakness * Chills * Depression * Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) * Low platelets (thrombocytopenia) leading to easy bleeding * Fever * Infection as a result of low neutrophils (neutropenia) * Elevated white blood cells (leukocytosis) * Coagulopathy (including DIC) * Bicytopenia Easy bleeding from low platelets may include: * Bruising (ecchymosis) * Gingival bleeding * Nose bleeds (epistaxis) * Increased menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) Pathogenesis Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene on chromosome 17 (RARA). In 95% of cases of APL, retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15, a translocation denoted as t(15;17)(q24;q21). The RAR receptor is dependent on retinoic acid for regulation of transcription. Eight other rare gene rearrangements have been described in APL fusing RARA to promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF also known as ZBTB16), nucleophosmin (NPM1), nuclear matrix associated (NUMA1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5B), protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1Œ± (PRKAR1A), factor interacting with PAPOLA and CPSF1 (FIP1L1), BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) or oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide- binding fold containing 2A (OBFC2A also known as NABP1) genes. Some of these rearrangements are ATRA-sensitive or have unknown sensitivity to ATRA because they are so rare; STAT5B/RARA and PLZF/RARA are known to be resistant to ATRA. The fusion of PML and RARA results in expression of a hybrid protein with altered functions. This fusion protein binds with enhanced affinity to sites on the cell's DNA, blocking transcription and differentiation of granulocytes. It does so by enhancing interaction of nuclear co-repressor (NCOR) molecule and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Although the chromosomal translocation involving RARA is believed to be the initiating event, additional mutations are required for the development of leukemia. RAR-Œ±/PLZF gene fusion produces a subtype of APL that is unresponsive to tretinoin therapy and less responsive to standard anthracycline chemotherapy hence leading to poorer long-term outcomes in this subset of patients. Diagnosis Acute promyelocytic leukemia can be distinguished from other types of AML based on microscopic examination of the blood film or a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy as well as finding the characteristic rearrangement. The presence of promyelocytes containing multiple Auer rods (termed faggot cells) on the peripheral blood smear is highly suggestive of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Definitive diagnosis requires testing for the PML/RARA fusion gene. This may be done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), or conventional cytogenetics of peripheral blood or bone marrow. This mutation involves a translocation of the long arm of chromosomes 15 and 17. On rare occasions, a cryptic translocation may occur which cannot be detected by cytogenetic testing; on these occasions PCR testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment =Initial treatment= Tretinoin Mitozantrone Methotrexate APL is unique among leukemias due to its sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin), the acid form of vitamin A. Treatment with ATRA dissociates the NCOR-HDACL complex from RAR and allows DNA transcription and differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes by targeting the oncogenic transcription factor and its aberrant action. Unlike other chemotherapies, ATRA does not directly kill the malignant cells. ATRA induces the terminal differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, after which these differentiated malignant cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis on their own. ATRA alone is capable of inducing remission but it is short-lived in the absence of concurrent \\"traditional\\" chemotherapy. As of 2013 the standard of treatment for concurrent chemotherapy has become arsenic trioxide, which combined with ATRA is referred to ATRA-ATO; before 2013 the standard of treatment was anthracycline (e.g. daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin or mitoxantrone)-based chemotherapy. Both chemotherapies result in a clinical remission in approximately 90% of patients with arsenic trioxide having a more favorable side effect profile. ATRA therapy is associated with the unique side effect of differentiation syndrome. This is associated with the development of dyspnea, fever, weight gain, peripheral edema and is treated with dexamethasone. The etiology of retinoic acid syndrome has been attributed to capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating promyelocytes. The monoclonal antibody, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, has been used successfully as a treatment for APL, although it has been withdrawn from the US market due to concerns regarding potential toxicity of the drug and it is not currently marketed in Australia, Canada or the UK. Given in conjunction with ATRA, it produces a response in around 84% of patients with APL, which is comparable to the rate seen in patients treated with ATRA and anthracycline-based therapy. It produces less cardiotoxicity than anthracycline-based treatments and hence may be preferable in these patients. =Maintenance therapy= After stable remission was induced, the standard of care previously was to undergo 2 years of maintenance chemotherapy with methotrexate, mercaptopurine and ATRA. A significant portion of patients relapsed without consolidation therapy. In the 2000 European APL study, the 2-year relapse rate for those that did not receive consolidation chemotherapy (ATRA not included) therapy was 27% compared to 11% in those that did receive consolidation therapy (p<0.01). Likewise in the 2000 US APL study, the survival rates in those receiving ATRA maintenance was 61% compared to just 36% without ATRA maintenance. However, recent research on consolidation therapy following ATRA-ATO, which became the standard treatment in 2013, has found that maintenance therapy in low-risk patients following this therapy may be unnecessary, although this is controversial. =Relapsed or refractory disease= Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is currently being evaluated for treatment of relapsed / refractory disease. Remission with arsenic trioxide has been reported. Studies have shown arsenic reorganizes nuclear bodies and degrades the mutant PML-RAR fusion protein.Soignet,Complete Remission After Treatment of APL with Arsenic Trioxide 1998, 1346 Arsenic also increases caspase activity which then induces apoptosis.Soignet, 1998, 1347 It does reduce the relapse rate for high risk patients.Arsenic Compound Improves Survival in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Patients . Sept 2007 In Japan a synthetic retinoid, tamibarotene, is licensed for use as a treatment for ATRA-resistant APL. =Investigational agents= Some evidence supports the potential therapeutic utility of histone deacetylase inhibitors such as valproic acid or vorinostat in treating APL. According to one study, a cinnamon extract has effect on the apoptotic process in acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells.  Prognosis  Prognosis is generally good relative to other leukemias. Because of the acuteness of onset compared to other leukemias, early death is comparatively more common. If untreated, it has median survival of less than a month. It has been transformed from a highly fatal disease to a highly curable one. The cause of early death is most commonly severe bleeding, often intracranial hemorrhage. Early death from hemorrhage occurs in 5‚Äì10% of patients in countries with adequate access to healthcare and 20‚Äì30% of patients in less developed countries. Risk factors for early death due to hemorrhage include delayed diagnosis, late treatment initiation, and high white blood cell count on admission. Despite advances in treatment, early death rates have remained relatively constant, as described by several groups including Scott McClellan, Bruno Medeiros, and Ash Alizadeh at Stanford University. Relapse rates are extremely low. Most deaths following remission are from other causes, such as second malignancies, which in one study occurred in 8% of patients. In this study, second malignancies accounted for 41% of deaths, and heart disease, 29%. Survival rates were 88% at 6.3 years and 82% at 7.9 years. In another study, 10-year survival rate was estimated to be approximately 77%. Epidemiology Acute promyelocytic leukemia represents 10‚Äì12% of AML cases. The median age is approximately 30‚Äì40 years, which is considerably younger than the other subtypes of AML (70 years). Incidence is higher among individuals of Latin American or South European origin. It can also occur as a secondary malignancy in those that receive treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors (such as the anthracyclines and etoposide) due to the carcinogenic effects of these agents, with patients with breast cancer representing the majority of such patients. Around 40% of patients with APL also have a chromosomal abnormality such as trisomy 8 or isochromosome 17 which do not appear to impact on long-term outcomes.

Tamaki is under the local governance of Auckland Council. It is part of the much larger TƒÅmaki parliamentary electorate. Demographics Tamaki had a population of 4,278 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 324 people (8.2%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 345 people (8.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,167 households. There were 2,118 males and 2,160 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female. The median age was 30.5 years, with 1,026 people (24.0%) aged under 15 years, 1,080 (25.2%) aged 15 to 29, 1,785 (41.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 384 (9.0%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 30.5% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 25.5% MƒÅori, 42.6% Pacific peoples, 18.7% Asian, and 2.7% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 35.8%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 29.9% had no religion, 51.3% were Christian, and 12.6% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 531 (16.3%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 687 (21.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $22,700. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,479 (45.5%) people were employed full-time, 399 (12.3%) were part-time, and 222 (6.8%) were unemployed. Education TƒÅmaki Primary School is a contributing primary school (years 1-6) with a roll of . Sommerville School is a school for students with special educational needs with a roll of .

Rolls are as of Volcano To the west of the suburb is Mount Wellington, a 137-metre volcanic peak which is part of the Auckland volcanic field, and which was formed by an eruption around 9,000 years ago. Related names By a quirk of geographical naming, the suburb of East Tamaki is located several kilometres to the south of Tamaki because it takes its name from the fact that it is on the eastern side of the Tamaki River, rather than from its relationship to Tamaki. The name TƒÅmaki was the MƒÅori name for the Auckland isthmus, and was later applied to the eastern part of early Auckland (towards the Tamaki River), as in the name of the Tamaki Road Board. The name TƒÅmaki is of contested origin. It is an ancient Polynesian word for battle; it can also mean full of people, i.e., heavily populated - an ironic possibility given that the Maori name of the heavily populated Auckland isthmus in MƒÅori is TƒÅmaki-makau-rau. A third possible origin of the names is TƒÅ-Maki, meaning successful attack by Maki, which was the name of a local tribal chief.

Kinney Tunnel, is a highway tunnel that carries U.S. Route 1 underneath the New River and Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The tunnel replaced the Federal Aid Highway Bridge, a drawbridge opened on August 26, 1926 and closed in 1958. Upon its completion in 1960, it was the only operating public tunnel in Florida, until the completion of the Port of Miami Tunnel in 2014, though two private tunnels exist at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista. Alfred Spear built the New River Tunnel. His business, the Thorington Construction Company of Providence, R.I., was responsible for the construction of the project.https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-1985-09-08-8502070552-story.html The tunnel was built after a lengthy debate on whether to construct another bridge or a tunnel. The predecessor drawbridge operated so slowly that it sometimes took motorists 45 minutes to cross from one end of the bridge to the other, creating massive traffic jams in the heart of the city. In 1986 it was renamed in honor of Henry E. Kinney, who had advocated its construction while he was chief of the Fort Lauderdale/Broward Edition of the Miami Herald newspaper.

Formed in 1991 (under the short- lived name Mutual Admiration Society) by Tom Carter, Christina Carter and Kyle Silfer, they have followed in the footsteps of other Texas psychedelic music artists such as the 13th Floor Elevators, and Red Crayola. Later members include Jason Bill and Heather Leigh Murray, but the band has long considered itself primarily a duo between Tom and Christina Carter. The name of the band derives from the surname of a customer at the record shop where Tom and Christina met. Their music contains elements typical of psychedelic music such as reverb, backwards recording, extended instrumental jamming and the use of found sounds. In addition to several major releases on labels such as Kranky, Eclipse Records, and Time-Lag Records, they have also released many small edition CD-Rs on their own Wholly Other label, and other small independent labels, some of which have later been re-issued (Our Bed is Green, and Historic Sixth Ward for example). Core members Tom Carter and Christina Carter are divorced but remain together as a musical unit. They have also released albums on Kranky and Eclipse Records under their own names, as well as several small edition CD-Rs. In addition the two have collaborated with numerous other musicians such as Loren Mazzacane Connors, Yellow Swans and Robert Horton.

Praeger Publishers, 2004.Allan Forte, M. R.: Listening to Classic American Popular Songs, p. 203. Yale University Press, 2001. The term comes from the saying, \\"to carry a torch for someone\\", or to keep aflame the light of an unrequited love. Tommy Lyman started the use in his praise of \\"My Melancholy Baby\\". The term is also explicitly cited in the song \\"Jim\\", popularized by versions by Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald: Someday, I know that Jim will up and leave me / But even if he does you can believe me / I'll go on carryin' the torch for Jim./ I'll go on lovin' my Jim. Torch-singing is more of a niche than a genre and can stray from the traditional jazz-influenced style of singing; the American tradition of the torch song typically relies upon the melodic structure of the blues.

Carolene Products Company, 304 U.S. 144 (1938), was a case of the United States Supreme Court that upheld the federal government's power to prohibit filled milk from being shipped in interstate commerce. In his majority opinion for the Court, Associate Justice Harlan F. Stone wrote that economic regulations were \\"presumptively constitutional\\" under a deferential standard of review known as the \\"rational basis test\\". The case is most notable for \\"Footnote Four\\", wherein Stone wrote that the Court would exercise a stricter standard of review when a law appears on its face to violate a provision of the United States Constitution, restricts the political process in a way that could impede the repeal of an undesirable law, or discriminates against \\"discrete and insular\\" minorities. Footnote Four would influence later Supreme Court decisions, and the higher standard of review is now known as \\"strict scrutiny\\".  Background  The case dealt with a federal law that prohibited filled milk (skimmed milk compounded with any fat or oil other than milk fat to resemble milk or cream) from being shipped in interstate commerce. The defendant, a company that traded in a form of filled milk consisting of condensed skim milk and coconut oil, argued that the law was unconstitutional because of both the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause. The previous term, the Court had dramatically enlarged the activities that were considered to be in or to affect interstate commerce. It had also altered its settled jurisprudence in the area of substantive due process, the doctrine dealing with rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. The changes meant that many New Deal programs that the Court would previously have struck down as unconstitutional would now be found constitutional. The defendant company, charged with breaking the law, at trial filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois granted the defendant's motion, and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling. Decision Justice Harlan Stone, writing for the Court, held that the law was \\"presumptively constitutional\\" properly within legislative discretion. It was not for the courts to overrule because it was supported by substantial public-health evidence and was not arbitrary or irrational. In other words, the Court applied a \\"rational basis\\" test. Footnote Four Carolene Products is best known for its fourth footnote, considered to be \\"the most famous footnote in constitutional law.\\" In U.S. constitutional law it is also considered the most important footnote according to the John Seigenthaler Chair of Excellence in First Amendment Studies. Although the Court had applied minimal scrutiny (rational basis review) to the economic regulation in this case, Footnote Four reserved for other types of cases other, stricter standards of review. Stone said that legislation aimed at \\"discrete and insular minorities\\" without the normal protections of the political process would be one exception to the presumption of constitutionality and justify a heightened standard of judicial review. The idea has greatly influenced jurisprudence on the Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence and judicial review. It recapitulated common law jurisprudence by which evidence of fraud or other significant legal defects in the transaction, such as self-dealing or other impropriety, may justify overturning a rule. The constitutional law scholar John Hart Ely based his major work, Democracy and Distrust, on Footnote Four's second and third paragraphs, which correspond to the \\"Democracy\\" and \\"Distrust\\" of his title. =Text= =Significance= In keeping with the New Deal Revolution, Carolene Products applies the \\"rational basis test\\" to economic legislation. An extremely low standard of judicial review, there is a presumption that the legislation in question is constitutional and the challenging party must show that the law fails the test. Most legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures that deals with economic regulation falls under rational basis review and, therefore, must only be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. However, Carolene Products is most famous for Footnote Four. Footnote Four describes certain legislative acts that might give rise to a higher level of scrutiny. If a law: # appears on its face to violate a provision of the US Constitution, especially in the Bill of Rights, # restricts the political process that could repeal an undesirable law, such as restricting voting rights, organizing, disseminating information etc., or # discriminates against \\"discrete and insular\\" minorities, especially racial, religious, and national minorities and particularly those who lack sufficient numbers or power to seek redress through the political process. This higher level of scrutiny, now called \\"strict scrutiny\\", was applied to strike down an inmate forced sterilization law in Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942) and in Justice Black's infamous opinion in Korematsu v. U.S. (1944) in which Japanese internment was upheld despite being subject to heightened scrutiny. Under strict scrutiny, a law will be struck down unless it serves a compelling governmental interest and is necessary to achieve that end, which means that less restrictive alternatives to the law must be considered by the government even if there is a compelling interest. Therefore, the law must be narrowly tailored to serve the governmental interest and employ the least restrictive alternative. Intermediate scrutiny, which is often applied in gender discrimination cases, did not arise until decades later. When applied, the law must serve an important governmental interest and be substantially related to that end. Some argue that the \\"most famous footnote\\" was in fact written by not Stone but his law clerk, Louis Lusky. In fact, the cited work above, while quite useful on the origin and growth of the footnote, does not claim that the law clerk was the author, and it implies the opposite, based on letters between the justices. In his later work, Our Nine Tribunes: The Supreme Court in Modern America, however, Lusky includes facsimiles of the original drafts of the footnote, the first of which is in his own hand. Stone edited the second, typed draft, and at the behest of the Chief Justice, he added certain passages. See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 304 *Nebbia v.

Background On July 23, 1898, Lieutenant John Heard anchored his force at the mouth of the Mani-Mani River and began unloading supplies intended for the Cuban insurgents operating in northwestern Cuba, unaware that the Spanish had discovered his presence and assembled a large force of cavalry in the environs. Battle Catching the Americans off guard, Spanish cavalry advanced out onto the beach and opened fire upon the landing parties. Heard ordered his men to take cover and return fire. Pounded by accurate American volleys, the Spanish withdrew back into the jungle. Lieutenant Heard used the temporary respite to order an immediate retreat, evacuating his wounded into the USS Wanderer and preparing to lift anchor just as the Spaniards reappeared, unleashing a hail of fire at those on the deck. Aftermath For his remarkable calm and courage in the heat of battle at Manimani, John Heard was later awarded a Medal of Honor noting, \\"after two men had been shot down by Spaniards while transmitting orders to the engine-room on the Wanderer, the ship having become disabled, this officer took the position held by them and personally transmitted the orders, remaining at his post until the ship was out of danger.\\" Battles of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Battles involving Cuba Battle of Rio Manimani Conflicts in 1898 Battle of Rio Manimani Battle of Rio Manimani ","title":"Battle of Rio Manimani"},{"id":"1214257","text":"IIAS could refer to * International Institute for Asian Studies * International Institute of Administrative Sciences * Indian Institute of Advanced Study * Indonesia International Auto Show * Inventory information approval system * International Institute for Advanced Studies in Systems Research and Cybernetics * Institutional Investor Advisory Services * Israel Institute for Advanced Studies ","title":"IIAS"},{"id":"1214265","text":"The Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) is a research institute based in Shimla, India. It was set up by the Ministry of Education, Government of India in 1964 and it started functioning from 20 October 1965. History and establishment The building that houses the institute was originally built as a home for Lord Dufferin, Viceroy of India from 1884‚Äì1888 and was called the Viceregal Lodge. It housed all the subsequent viceroys and governors-general of India. It occupied Observatory Hill, one of the seven hills that Shimla is built upon. The building is designed in Indo-Gothic style. The building was designed by Henry Irwin, an architect in the Public Works Department. The Viceregal Lodge had electricity as early as 1888, much before the rest of the town of Shimla. The building also was equipped with a sophisticated firefighting mechanism through wax-tipped water ducts. Many historic decisions have been taken in the building during the Indian independence movement. The Simla Conference was held here in 1945. The decision to carve out Pakistan and East Pakistan from India was also taken here in 1947. After India gained independence, the building was renamed Rashtrapati Niwas and was used as a summer retreat for the president of India. However, due to its neglect, Dr. S Radhakrishnan decided to turn it into a centre of higher learning. The summer retreat of the president was shifted from here to a building known as \\"The Retreat\\" situated in Chharabra, on the outskirts of Shimla. The Indian Institute of Advanced Study was first created as a society on 6 October 1964. The institute was formally inaugurated by Prof. S. Radhakrishnan on 20 October 1965. The eminent historian, Professor Niharranjan Ray, was appointed as the first Director of the Institute. Around 2004, a rare stick√© court was discovered on the grounds of the Viceregal Lodge complex. A bell made of eight metals which was presented by the king of Nepal was available to be admired by tourists till April 2010. The lawn in front of the lodge is above a water tank. All the rainwater from the building goes to this water tank. This rainwater harvesting system goes back to the 18th century when this building was designed by the Scottish architects. The Institute of Advance Studies is the first electrified building in Shimla. This electricity was run by steam engines which were brought from Britain. Administration The Institute is administered by a Society and a Governing Body, the members of which come from varied backgrounds. A statutory Finance Committee advises the Governing body in financial matters. The director of the institute is assisted by a secretary, a deputy secretary a public relations officer and other supervisory staff. Academics The fellows currently focus on the following areas: * Humanities ** Arts and Aesthetics ** Comparative Study of Literature ** Study of Religion and Philosophy * Social Sciences ** Development Studies ** Comparative Study of Political Institutions ** Socio-economic and Socio- Cultural Formation in Historical Perspective. * Natural and Life Sciences ** State Policies on Science and Technology ** Science, Technology and Development ** Methodologies and Techniques. Fellowship The Institute has two fellowship programs National Fellows and Fellows. The term of National Fellows at the Institute is for a maximum period of two years. For Fellows, the backbone of the Institute, the duration of regular Fellowships ranges from a minimum of six months to a maximum of two years. This depends on the nature of work and its progress. Initially, a Fellowship is awarded for a year. While Fellows of the Institute are primarily engaged in their own research on themes approved by the Institute, the considerable formal and informal interaction amongst them encourages a healthy interdisciplinary dialogue. From April to November, the Fellows' weekly seminar is the primary forum for formal interaction. During their term, Fellows remain in residence from April to November. From December to March, they may engage in field work, library and archival consultations outside Shimla. Upon the completion of their term, Fellows are required to submit their completed research work in the form of a monograph to the Institute. The monographs submitted by them are considered for publication by the Institute - which also retains the first right of publication. = Visiting Professors, Visiting Scholars and Guest Scholars = Apart from Fellows, other scholars also contribute to, and benefit from, the Institute. They come as Visiting Professors, Visiting Scholars and Guest Scholars. Visiting Professors are eminent scholars invited by the Governing Body of the Institute to deliver lectures and give seminars at the Institute. During an in-residence stay of up to four weeks, they also interact informally with Fellows of the Institute. Similarly, Visiting Scholars also come to the Institute on invitation. Like Visiting Professors, they too are distinguished in their respective fields, but their stay is limited to a week and all facilities of the Institute are extended to them. Guest Scholars visit the Institute - subject to the availability of accommodation; they too are welcome to utilize the facilities on a nominal payment. The visiting professors to IIAS includes a large number of philosophers which include Prof. Kanchana Natarajan, and Prof. Enakshi Ray Mitra. The International Centre for Human Development (IC4HD) The International Centre for Human Development (IC4HD) is set up in IIAS to support efforts by governments of the South to integrate human development approaches and ensure improved development outcomes for poor and marginalized people. The IC4HD center was inaugurated on 19 August 2013 in the Institute with the aim to promote policy dialogue on human development in the Global South and work towards translating human development analysis into action. The partnership between the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was officially launched at an event held in Delhi on 4 January 2013. The Centre will provide a range of services to national governments in translating human development approach into policy through a four-pronged approach viz. Policy Advisory Services, South-South Cooperation, Research on HD issues and Monitoring and Evaluation. Tagore Centre On the 150th Birth Anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS) was awarded the Tagore Centre for the Study of Culture and Civilization by the HRD Ministry of Government of India. Activities of the Tagore Centre * There are four fellows in residence at the Centre every year. None of the fellows are permanent and their term is for a minimum of six months to a maximum of two years. They enjoy facilities similar to those enjoyed by the fellows of IIAS. One of the fellows may be either a poet, or a writer, or an artist-in-residence as a tribute to Tagore‚Äôs multifaceted personality. Another may be a scholar from outside India. The fellows are known as Tagore Fellows. * An annual International Seminar on some aspect of Tagore‚Äôs concerns is proposed to be conducted. This will preferably not be of an exegetical nature but more an engagement with his substantial concerns as stated in the vision document. * A study week on Tagore‚Äôs works would be organized every alternate year. * An artist camp could perhaps be organized every alternate year. * An annual Tagore Lecture would be organized. IIAS Library Established in 1965, the Library has been established to facilitate, promote and support research to Fellows of the Institute. It is one of the leading research and reference libraries in Humanities and Social Science in the country. The Social Science collections, in fact, are worldwide in coverage and significance. Publication The Institute has over 450 publications to its credit. These include monographs submitted by its Fellows, edited proceedings of seminars, symposia, workshops and conferences held at the Institute, lectures given by Visiting Professors and occasional papers presented by Fellows and visitors to the Institute. The Institute also publishes a review journal, Summerhill; IIAS Review, which carries reviews of books published by the Institute and those received from outside - as well as interviews and important information about the various academic activities of the Institute. A biannual journal, Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences, is also published under the auspices of the Inter-University Centre for Humanities and Social Sciences.

SKYY Vodka is 40% ABV or 80 proof, except in Australia and New Zealand where it is 37.5% ABV / 75 Proof and in South Africa where it is 43% ABV / 86 Proof. Its creator, Maurice Kanbar, claims the vodka is nearly congener-free due to its distillation process. That is why the popular company slogan is \\"Vodka so filtered - we even took the Russia out of it\\". The bottle is a cobalt blue with a clear, adhesive label. In 2008, SKYY expanded the SKYY Vodka line with seventeen new flavors, referred to as SKYY Infusions. These SKYY Infusions are made with fruit. Brand ownership history SKYY vodka was originally sold by SKYY Spirits LLC, established in 1992 by Maurice Kanbar. In 2009 SKYY Spirits LLC was acquired by Campari Group, and in 2012 was renamed Campari America. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Gruppo Campari, and markets not only the vodka line, but other Campari products as well. Manufacturing Production and bottling of the product was initially outsourced to Frank-Lin Distillers Products in San Jose, California. Bulk ethanol was delivered in railroad tank cars to Frank-Lin's railroad siding near the San Jose rail yards. The ethanol was mixed with filtered and deionized water, flavoring was added, and the product was bottled using a 42-head US Bottlers Machinery Company filling machine to ensure uniform product level. The ethanol was purchased from MGP Ingredients of Atchison, Kansas, a bulk ethanol producer for beverage, industrial, and fuel applications. MGP uses wheat as a feedstock for the process. The distillation plant is in Pekin, Illinois and is currently powered by natural gas, but United States Environmental Protection Agency approval has been requested to convert the plant to burn coal. After the acquisition of the brand by Gruppo Campari, production was moved to Campari facilities. Awards The unflavored SKYY won silver medals at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

It was opened in 1906, on a site bounded by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street. Designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by Woodhouse, Willoughby and Langham in red brick and terracotta, it cost ¬£142,000 to build and was built by J. Gerrard and Sons of Swinton. It has been a Grade II* listed building since 1974. In addition to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for eighty years, housing the firemen, their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles a few years after its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in. The building was the headquarters of the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The fire station closed in 1986, since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals. It was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a compulsory purchase order on the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building after nearly 30 years of dereliction. It was sold to Allied London in 2015 and renovation commenced in 2018 with the building to be redeveloped as a mixed-use comprising leisure and hotel facilities. Construction In 1897 the Manchester Watch Committee was considering a replacement for its fire station on Jackson's Row. A five- man sub-committee was set up and recommended a site on Newton Street. In 1899, George William Parker who had designed fire stations in Bootle and Belfast, and been referred to as the \\"architect of the world's fire service\\" was appointed Chief of the Manchester Fire Brigade and asked his opinion on the proposal. Parker reported that the site on Newton Street was unsuitable and submitted plans for a fire station on a site bounded by London Road, Whitworth Street, Minshull Street South and Fairfield Street. Parker's proposal was for a 7-bay fire station on a site more than double the size of the one proposed on Newton Street. The choice of London Road was influenced by its proximity to a development of warehouses on Whitworth Street and Princess Street. Parker convinced the city council to choose his proposals rather than those on Newton Street. A competition, with prizes of ¬£300, ¬£200 and ¬£100 (equivalent to ¬£, ¬£ and ¬£ in ) was organised to design the new fire station. The competition drew interest from across the country, attracting 25 entries. The winning entry was by John Henry Woodhouse, George Harry Willoughby and John Langham, a team of local architects. Their design was based closely on Parker's initial plans. The fire station was described by Fire Call magazine as \\"the finest fire station in this round world\\" before construction started. The fire station was built between 1904 and 1906 at a cost of ¬£142,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The building's substructure and foundations were built by C. H. Normanton of Manchester. The superstructure was built by Gerrard's of Swinton at a cost of ¬£75,360. It was faced with red brick and terracotta by Burmantofts, a common choice for early 20th-century buildings in Manchester as it was cleanable and resisted the pollution and acid rain caused by local industry. Other notable Manchester buildings from this era making use of terracotta include the Midland Hotel, the Refuge Assurance Building, the University of Manchester's Sackville Street Building and the Victoria Baths. The building's exterior featured sculptural models by John Jarvis Millson representing the functions of the building such as justice, fire and water. The building had stained glass windows and the interior was decorated with glazed bricks, similar to other public buildings of this era in the city, such as the Victoria Baths. The similarities suggest the influence and adoption of a standard design by Henry Price's newly created City Architect's Department. Operation The station's coroner's court The building was opened on 27 September 1906 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester James Herbert Thewlis. In addition to the fire station, it housed a police station on Whitworth Street, an ambulance station on Minshull Street South, a branch of Williams Deacon's Bank at the corner of London Road and Fairfield Street, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station on London Road. The coroner's court and gas-meter testing station replaced the proposed public library and gym. thumb270pxPlan showing the layout of the building. Legend alt=A plan graphically illustrating the layout of the uses of the building discussed in the text. The fire station contained flats for 32 firemen and their families and 6 single firemen. Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert firemen to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened. The building has a hose tower and a ventilation system designed by Musgrave and Company to prevent the odour from the horses' stalls entering the firemens' living quarters. Fresh air was drawn in through the top of the fire station's tower, purified and circulated around the building. When the air reached the end of the circuit, in the stalls, it was extracted from the building. The system meant that the air in the building was replaced every 10 minutes. During the Second World War the basement was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension built in the yard to provide more space in the control room. The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942. After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade was again municipalised, and reorganised. London Road Fire Station was restored as the headquarters of the brigade and became the only fire station serving the city centre. A fire service training centre was established in 1948. At about the same time, the ambulance station closed and was converted into the fire brigade's workshops. The control room was modernised in 1952, becoming the first in the country with equipment to record emergency calls. The interior was refurbished in 1955. The exterior had been cleaned every year since the fire station opened, and as a result was in pristine condition when the building celebrated its Golden Jubilee on 6 October 1956. Decline A alt=Photograph By the end of the 1960s maintenance was becoming increasingly expensive, and the building's design ill-suited to modern fire appliances. Plans to replace the fire station were put on hold pending the formation of the Greater Manchester Fire Service. The building has been Grade II* listed since 1974, the same year that the replacement of the Manchester Fire Brigade by the Greater Manchester Fire Service precipitated the relocation of the brigade's headquarters to a new facility in Swinton. As part of the reorganisation, London Road became the headquarters of the brigade's \\"E Division\\", with the station's control room responsible for two divisions covering the City of Manchester, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport and Tameside. The reorganisation meant the number of appliances was reduced, until only three remained at the station. The control room at London Road closed in 1979, replaced by a single computerised control room at brigade headquarters in Swinton. In the same year, following the establishment of Greater Manchester Police and a reorganisation of policing in the city, the police station in the building also closed. The closure left the ground floor on the Whitworth Street side empty. The last tenants of the bank section, a firm of solicitors, and the fire brigade's workshops, also vacated the building at about the same time. In 1984 construction work began on a ¬£, replacement in Thompson Street and in 1985 the old London Road Fire Station was brought within the Whitworth Street Conservation Area. In 1986 the fire service left London Road for its new fire station, London Road Fire Station closed and the building was sold. Dereliction and redevelopment The entrance to the Coroner's Court. Above the doorway to the left is alt=Photograph After the sale the building was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, with varying degrees of success. The coroner's court was the last to vacate the premises, in 1998. In 2001, the building was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum was building for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act. In February 2006, Argent, developers proposed leasing the building from Britannia Hotels to transform it into a music and arts venue. Manchester City Council backed the plans and refused to rule out a compulsory purchase order (CPO) if the owner did not act to redevelop the building. Britannia Hotels branded Argent's plans \\"unworkable\\" and proposed turning the building into a company headquarters, 200-bed hotel, and fire station museum. A planning application was promised by March 2006, but by May none had been made. Work was carried out by February 2007 to make the building watertight and in autumn 2007 a proposal was made by Britannia to convert the building into a hotel. Fireman's pole in the fire engine room. Britannia Hotels appointed Purcell Miller Tritton to draw up plans to convert the building into a hotel in 2008 but none were produced by May 2009 and the city council lost faith in Britannia Hotels' commitment to its redevelopment. The city council was concerned that the state of the fire station was limiting regeneration in the area, including a proposed government complex on the former Mayfield Railway Station site. The city council set a deadline of July 2009 for progress on redevelopment. Britannia Hotels' proposal in July 2009 was to convert the fire station into a hotel with a 15-storey tower in its courtyard and promised a planning application by October 2009, but none was made and the city council's Chief Executive recommended issuing a CPO. A meeting of the city council in January 2010 approved a request for up to ¬£5.25 million to cover the costs associated with the fire station's acquisition. Britannia Hotels responded by pledging to make a new proposal by February 2010, rendering the CPO unnecessary. Britannia submitted an application to turn the fire station into a 227-bed 4-star hotel in June 2010. The Victorian Society praised the proposed conversion. Manchester City Council decided to continue with the CPO. The city council issued a CPO on 5 August 2010. Despite the plans being approved 16 September 2010, the council continued to pursue a CPO and solicited bids for a development partner in January 2011. Britannia's objection to the CPO led to a public inquiry in April 2011. On 29 November 2011, the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed the CPO had been rejected. Despite Britannia's guarantee at the inquiry to proceed with the development it reconsidered its plans. In a letter to English Heritage, Britannia said the proposed scheme was unsustainable for the foreseeable future. Britannia wanted to return to the rejected tower plan. English Heritage and the city council expressed disappointment. The city council offered to buy the building at market value. In February 2013 after a public meeting the Friends of London Road Fire Station (FoLRFS) was formed to pressurise Britannia Hotels and persuade the council to attempt a second CPO. The group organised an online petition, fundraising events, public meetings, an online survey to discover locals' views, an art exhibition and public engagement with its history, and published the outcome of a Freedom of Information Act request on what the council had done regarding surveying the building and issuing urgent-works notices. In November 2013, Britannia applied to extend the 2010 planning permissions but despite objections the applications were approved on technical grounds in December 2013. The council considered applying for a CPO for the second time in September 2014 and confirmed its intention to do so in December 2014 and meet with FoLRFS in early 2015. FoLRFS received a grant from Locality's Community Assets in Difficult Ownership (CADO) programme to pay for public outreach work.

On the dark blue shield the Sun rises over a lake and peninsula, a man holding a long gun with a raised hand represents peace and the ability to defend his rights. The elk and moose are symbols of Michigan, while the bald eagle represents the United States. The design features three Latin mottos. From top to bottom they are: #On the red ribbon: , \\"Out of many, one,\\" a motto of the United States #On the blue shield: , \\"I will defend\\" #On the white ribbon: , \\"If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you,\\" which is the official state motto. It was adopted in 1835 and said to have been suggested by the tribute to architect Christopher Wren at Saint Paul's Cathedral in London, which reads (Latin \\"If you seek [his] monument, look around you\\"). The seal was adopted on June 22, 1835.

He coined the doctrine of military-political mutual exclusivity that became known as the Schneider Doctrine.Peter Kornbluh (September 11, 2013). The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability. The New Press. p. 22. . Background He was born in Concepci√≥n, Chile, as a descendant of ethnic German immigrants, and joined the army in 1929. After a brilliant career, he was named Commander-in-Chief on October 27, 1969, by President Eduardo Frei Montalva, as a result of the Tacna agreement. Schneider had expressed firm opposition to the idea of preventing Allende's inauguration by means of a coup d'√©tat; as a constitutionalist, he wished to continue the Chilean military's long apolitical history. Assassination After the 1970 Chilean presidential election, a plot to kidnap Schneider was developed. \\"Neutralizing\\" Schneider became a key prerequisite for a military coup; he opposed any intervention by the armed forces to block Allende's constitutional election. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who considered Schneider \\"a major stumbling block for military officers seeking to carry out a coup,\\" supplied a group of Chilean officers led by General Camilo Valenzuela with \\"sterile\\" weapons for the operation which was to be blamed on Allende supporters.CIA Cable Transmissions on Coup Plotting, October 18, 1970, taken from Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973. Peter Kornbluh, National Security Archive =First and second attempts= On October 16, 1970, based on an anonymous tip on Schneider's whereabouts, the first group attempted to kidnap him from his home. The tip turned out to be false as he had been on vacation since two days earlier and didn't return till the next day. On the evening of October 19, 1970, a second group of coup-plotters loyal to General Roberto Viaux, equipped with tear gas grenades attempted to grab Schneider as he left an official dinner. The attempt failed because he left in a private car and not the expected official vehicle. The failure produced an extremely significant cable from CIA headquarters in Washington to the local station, asking for urgent action because \\"Headquarters must respond during morning 20 October to queries from high levels.\\" Payments of $50,000 each to Viaux and his chief associate were then authorised on the condition that they made another attempt.Lubna Z. Qureshi. Nixon, Kissinger, and Allende: U.S. Involvement in the 1973 Coup in Chile. Lexington Books, 2009. p. 64. =Final attempt= On October 22, 1970, the coup-plotters again attempted to kidnap Schneider. His official car was ambushed at a street intersection in the capital city of Santiago. Schneider drew a gun to defend himself, and was shot point-blank several times. According to a report by the Chilean military police, \\"five individuals, one of who, making use of a blunt instrument similar to a sledgehammer, broke the rear window and then fired at General Schneider, striking him in the region of the spleen, in the left shoulder, and in the left wrist.\\" He was rushed to a military hospital, but the wounds proved fatal and he died three days later, on October 25. The attempt to kidnap him was because Schneider was the army Commander-in-Chief and considered a constitutionalist, which in practical terms meant that he would not support a coup. This incident and his death provoked national outrage, and caused the citizens and the military to rally behind the just-elected Allende, who was ratified by the Chilean Congress on October 24. It also helped to ensure an orderly transfer of power to Allende. Military courts in Chile found that Schneider's death was caused by two military groups, one led by Viaux and the other by General Camilo Valenzuela. Viaux and Valenzuela were eventually convicted of charges of conspiring to cause a coup,Peter Kornbluh (September 11, 2013). The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability. The New Press. p. 34. . and Viaux also was convicted of kidnapping. The lawsuit asserted that the CIA had aided both groups, but the charges were never satisfactorily proven, with the expectation of tens of thousands of dollars and also machine guns given to them by the CIA. Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive's Chile Documentation Project, asserts that CIA documents show \\"Viaux was not acting independently or unilaterally, but clearly as a co-conspirator with Valenzuela...\\" On October 26, 1970, President Eduardo Frei Montalva named General Carlos Prats as Commander-in-Chief to replace Schneider. This happened at the same time that $35,000 was given by the CIA to the kidnappers \\"to keep the prior contact secret, maintain the goodwill of the group, and for humanitarian reasons.\\"John Dinges. The Condor Years: How Pinochet And His Allies Brought Terrorism To Three Continents. The New Press, 2005. p. 20. CIA Activities in Chile https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general- reports-1/chile/index.html#15 Lawsuits On September 10, 2001 Schneider's family filed a suit against Henry Kissinger, accusing him of collaborating with Viaux in arranging for Schneider's murder.Family to Sue Kissinger For Death. CBS News. September 6, 2001. While declassified documents show the CIA, displeased with the socialist victory, had explored the idea of supporting Viaux in a coup attempt, they also show that the agency decided on tracking down other members of the Chilean military, deciding that a Viaux coup would fail. Nevertheless, Viaux, acting on the advice of the CIA, teamed up with other coup plotters. CIA documents show unwavering support for Viaux's co- conspirator, Camilo Valenzuela, and also show a $50,000 payment to the kidnap team Viaux had hired. Documents written at the time of the assault on Schneider describe it as part of the \\"Valenzuela group coup plan.\\"Peter Kornbluh (September 11, 2013). The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability. The New Press. p. 33. . On October 15, 1970 Kissinger allegedly told U.S. President Richard Nixon that he had \\"turned off\\" plans to support Viaux, explaining that \\"Nothing could be worse than an abortive coup.\\" The CIA claimed that no such \\"stand-down\\" order was ever received.John Dinges. The Condor Years: How Pinochet And His Allies Brought Terrorism To Three Continents. The New Press, 2005. p. 157. The U.S. government claims it did not intend for Schneider to be murdered, only kidnapped. When Alexander Haig, Kissinger's aide, was asked \\"is kidnapping not a crime?\\" he replied \\"that depends.\\" Such an argument would carry no weight in any court of law.Lubna Z. Qureshi. Nixon, Kissinger, and Allende: U.S. Involvement in the 1973 Coup in Chile. Lexington Books, 2009. p. 65. Christopher Hitchens noted that Chilean authorities treated the crime as a straightforward murder. He argued that, \\"under the law of every law-bound country (including the United States), a crime committed in the pursuit of a kidnapping is thereby aggravated, not mitigated. You may not say, with a corpse at your feet, 'I was only trying to kidnap him.'\\"Christopher Hitchens. The Trial of Henry Kissinger. Verso, 2001. p. 63-64. . The lawsuit against Kissinger was eventually dismissed in the federal district court; the dismissal was subsequently upheld by the D.C. Court of Appeals. A petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was denied.

Located to the north of Auckland, the island is separated from the mainland to the west by Jellicoe Channel, and from the larger Great Barrier Island to the east by Cradock Channel. The two aptly named islands shelter the Hauraki Gulf from many of the storms of the Pacific Ocean. Settled by MƒÅori sometime between 1350 and 1650, the island was occupied by those people until the New Zealand government declared the island a wildlife sanctuary in 1897. Since the island came under control of the government, it has been under limited access, with only a few rangers living on the island. In the MƒÅori language, the name of the island name means \\"the resting place of lingering breezes\\". Along with its larger neighbour Great Barrier, it was given its English name by Captain James Cook in 1769. The island is a nature sanctuary which has been described by the MBIE as \\"the most intact [native] ecosystem in New Zealand\\". However, several invasive species were introduced by both Maori and European settlers, including cats, which were destructive to local small bird and reptile species until they were eradicated between July 1977 and June 1980 in what was possibly New Zealand's costliest pest control programme.  History  Rahui Te Kiri and her daughter were evicted by the Crown from Little Barrier Island in 1896 The island (in the distance) from over Great Barrier Island. MƒÅori occupied the island for centuries prior to the first European visits, probably first settling there between 1350 and 1650 CE. The initial occupation was by descendants of Toi te Huatahi, followed by Tainui, who were then conquered by NgƒÅti Wai. By 1881 only a few NgƒÅti Wai were still living there and the British Crown attempted to buy the island in order to turn it into a nature reserve. After the purchase fell through, the island was instead appropriated through an Act of Parliament in 1894 and became New Zealand's first nature reserve the following year.\\"Features: Little Barrier Island Nature Reserve (Hauturu-o-Toi)\\". Department of Conservation (New Zealand). Retrieved 8 September 2012. Maori such as Rahui Te Kiri were evicted from the island by force in 1896. Since 1897, there has always been a caretaker or ranger resident on the island. In 2011 the crown settled treaty claims with local iwi, Hauturu was returned to iwi who in turn gifted it back to the people of Aotearoa. Access is heavily restricted for conservation reasons, and the island is uninhabited except for rotational conservation staff, scientists and rangers under the authority of the Department of Conservation. Electricity for their needs was provided by a diesel generator linked to a battery bank until 2005, and has since been replaced by twenty 175-watt solar panels, with the generator remaining solely for backup. Over the expected 20-year life-span, the new system is expected to generate fuel savings sufficient to replace its purchase costs. =Stonework= MƒÅori stonework has been found in fourteen locations on the island, primarily around the coastal flats at Te Titoki Point. Man-made cuttings, which were described in 1895 as ruts for hauling canoes, can be seen on the boulder beach ridge at Te Titoki Point. There are also stone rows measuring up to long, wide and high, located near the mouth of Te Waikohare Stream. Stone rows and heaps can be found to from the mouths of Te Waikohare and Tirikawa Streams. The largest is high and wide. The most extensive stonework is located in the northwest of the island, near the ridge south of Te Hue Stream, where it is spread over several hectares. This site includes a number of terraces, which are stone- faced or have stone retaining walls. There are also numerous stone heaps and rows, and several free standing stone walls. Stonework in the northeast of the island is more weathered than in other areas and partially buried. Because of this weathering these features are thought to be older than at the other sites.  Geography  The island is an extinct andesitic stratovolcano, roughly circular in shape, about across, with an area of . Its earliest volcanic activity is estimated to have occurred 3 million years ago and the latest 1.2 million years ago. The volcano is most closely related to two volcanoes over northwest, near Whangarei. The island is steeply sloping, and deeply dissected by ravines radiating from a central range that peaks at Mount Hauturu whose altitude is . Te Titoki Point is the only area of flat land on the island. Environment A dense forest cover shelters numerous rare or endangered animal species. The total number of species of native plants is thought to range around 400, and the island may shelter more endangered birds than any other island in New Zealand. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a nesting site for vulnerable Cook's and Parkinson's petrels. In February 2013, there were reports of the critically endangered New Zealand storm petrel (Oceanites maorianus) breeding on the island. Kakapo (night parrots), also critically endangered, were (re)introduced to the island in 2012; as of July 2017, their population on the island stood at 14. A North Island k≈çkako feeding in a coprosma tree on Little Barrier Island When MƒÅori occupied the island, as much as a third of the island was cleared of forest. However, since the acquisition of the land by the New Zealand government, all but 20 hectares of the island have been reforested. Bryde's whales, Orcas and Bottlenose dolphins live in the waters around the island. Blue whale and Southern right whales rest in this area during migration. In 2012, there were reports that a southern right whale may have calved near the island. =Invasive Species= Mammals The Pacific rat or kiore (Rattus exulans). were likely introduced as invasive species during the initial settlement of the island by MƒÅori. Eradication took place by aerial dropped poison baits in 2004. Feral cats arrived on the island in the early 1870s. As in other places where predatory species were introduced, small animals not accustomed to predation likely experienced a decline in population, being pushed towards endangerment or extinction. In a survey of studies about eradicating the cats, scientist C.R. (\\"Dick\\") Veitch mentions several small species which were likely affected by the cats, including small reptiles and birds, such as the North Island snipe (Coenocorypha barrierensis), which only survived into the European era on this island and was formerly distributed across the entirety of the North Island, North Island saddleback (Philesturnus rufusater), grey-faced petrel (Pterodroma macroptera gouldi), Cook's petrel (Pterodroma cookii) and black petrel (Proeellaria parkinsoni). In the July 1977 to 23 June 1980 period, eradication was completed by a dedicated team, and 151 cats were killed using traps and poison. Insects Introduced wasps (German, Common, Asian Paper, and Tasmanian paper wasps) are all present on the island; in some years wasps are in plague numbers. Plants Prior to 1995 very little attention was paid to weed species on the island. The rangers' garden had been planted in exotics and bird and wind dispersed colonisers were spreading fast. In 1996 a weed control programme based in the successful work on the Kermadecs was implemented with teams of weeders grid searching the island. The main target species were Climbing Asparagus, Mexican Devil and Mist Flower.

A 2003 bill to make the song an official state song failed to pass. History Winifred Lee Brent Lyster of Detroit wrote the original 1862 lyrics of \\"Michigan, My Michigan\\" to the tune of \\"O Tannenbaum\\" (known in English as \\"O Christmas Tree\\"), and which was also the melody of \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". Her husband, Henry, was a physician who rose to be Medical Inspector and Acting Medical Director of III Corps in the Union Army.

Long of Grand Rapids wrote new lyrics in 1886 but kept the original tune and original Civil War sentiment. In 1902, Douglas Malloch wrote the current lyrics for a convention of the Michigan State Federation of Woman's Clubs in Muskegon. He deemed them more suitable for a peacetime anthem. A new tune was also composed for the song by composer W. Otto Miessner of Detroit.\\"Michigan, my Michigan\\": a new state song / words by Douglas Malloch; music by W.

For most of its time on air, The CW Plus and its predecessor, The WB 100+ Station Group, carried the show in most smaller markets. The Daily Buzz was also featured on the schedules of the Youtoo TV and Soul of the South networks; streamed live-to-air on the program's website, and uploaded daily to Hulu.http://www.hulu.com/the-daily-buzz When it was revived as a weekly series, Buzz was re-added to the Youtoo America and Soul of the South schedules, added to the schedule of cable network Pop, and offered to various local stations. Series history =Original series (2002-2015)= The Daily Buzz was conceived out of a desire by station owner ACME Communications to increase original content to its stations' schedules, most of which aired infomercials and reruns in its morning drive hours, and to bolster local ad revenue for those stations.\\"Mayhem in the A.M.,\\" from Orlando Sentinel, 4/10/2005 (accessed 8/12/2017) The Daily Buzz formally launched on the morning of September 16, 2002, airing on 10 ACME-owned stations, all of which were affiliates of The WB Television Network, including the station from which it originated during its first two years on-air, WBDT in Dayton, Ohio.\\"The Daily Buzz,\\" from ALNTV.WordPress.com, 3/23/2009 The original on-air talent included anchors Ron Corning and Andrea Jackson, newsreader Peggy Bunker, and weather and features presenter Mitch English. From its debut, The Daily Buzz employed a personality-driven on-air approach, one that was looser, faster in pace, and sometimes edgy in comparison to tradition-bound network breakfast television shows broadcast by ABC (Good Morning America), CBS (The Early Show), and NBC (Today): Slang terms, pop music, and host commentaries would be interjected in the news summaries. Pop culture segments were liberally employed (see below). The hosts' employed not-as-formal forms of dress and demeanor (dancing in the lead-outs to commercial breaks were not uncommon). And above all, the liveliness trumped the serious. The lively tone was intentional, as it was meant to attract an audience that was younger in age and were more likely to get their news from sources other than traditional local and network TV newscasts. As Andrea Jackson described it to the Orlando Sentinel in 2005, \\"We always talk about [The Daily Buzz] as morning radio on television or late- night television in the morning. It's infotainment.\\" During its early years, The Daily Buzz included several live or prerecorded standing features in its broadcast, all utilizing the show's overall irreverent tone. Among the features were: *\\"Plugged Into the News\\" (the latest news headlines, utilizing content from CNN and Associated Press) *\\"News by the Numbers\\" (a highlighting of numerical figures in notable news stories) *\\"Keeping Them Honest\\" (a clearinghouse for the most ridiculous government- and politically-themed news) *\\"Mitch's World\\" (Mitch English giving his take on the news, ending the segment with a story-related punchline) *\\"Old School\\" (poking fun at vintage commercials, PSAs, and instructional/educational films) *\\"Viewer Calls\\" (calls from actual viewers to a Daily Buzz hotline augmented for TV through the use of 2-frame animation) *\\"Water Cooler\\" (viewer comments shared by Clayton Morris) On January 1, 2004, ACME Communications would sell a 50% interest in The Daily Buzz to fellow broadcaster Emmis Communications. The deal would lead in a relocation of the show in August 2004 from Dayton to the Orlando, Florida area, and into the Lake Mary studios of Emmis-owned WKCF. In early 2007, WKCF moved to WESH's studios in Winter Park after WESH owners Hearst-Argyle Television acquired WKCF to create a duopoly in the Orlando market; soon afterward, Emmis sold its stake in The Daily Buzz back to ACME. In mid-April 2007, The Daily Buzzs previous studios were acquired by Trinity Broadcasting Network and Good Life Broadcasting for new studios for their respective stations, WTGL-TV (now WHLV-TV) and WLCB-TV (the present-day WTGL).http://rogersimmons.com/tv/2006_11_01_archive.html At this time, the show also changed Orlando affiliates, from WKCF to WRDQ, and relocated for six weeks to a temporary home inside the Disney-MGM Studios. The show's time at Disney was an interim period until new, permanent studios were completed on the campus of Full Sail University in Winter Park in June 2007. The Daily Buzz's first show at Full Sail aired on June 19, 2007, and they continued to broadcast there until the show's 2015 cancellation. By the end of the 2000s decade, The Daily Buzz would mature somewhat in tone: Many of the show's looser recurring segments, including some of those mentioned above, were phased out, and The Daily Buzz began to utilize a tone that was tighter and more organized yet still utilizing some of the humor and irreverence it had used since its debut. Also by this time, Buzz producers would allow the show's affiliates two windows each hour to insert their own local content, with national content continuing for stations who did not insert their own segments.\\"'The Daily Buzz' Adds Local Content Slots,\\" from TVNewsCheck, 1/16/2008 The likely genesis for this move was the success of ACME-owned Buzz affiliate WBUW/Madison, Wisconsin, who began adding their own segments (Buzzed Into Madison) in early 2007.\\"Catching a Homespun Buzz\\", from Broadcasting & Cable, March 3, 2008 2010‚Äì2012 logo.In 2010, Fisher Communications joined ACME Communications on a licensing and consulting agreement for The Daily Buzz. The agreement allowed Fisher to take over production of the show on ACME's behalf (they would move production to HD in 2010), and gave Fisher the option of purchasing the show from ACME. The agreement also allowed Fisher to create Buzz Brands, a service that offered multimedia content, both local in nature and from The Daily Buzz, to local affiliates for multiple media platforms (including TV, online, and even radio). The first Buzz Brand platform to launch was \\"GalTime,\\" a female-oriented platform that began with an October 2010 soft launch before expanding nationwide in early 2011;Local With A Multiplatform Focus\\", from tvnewscheck.com, 2/24/2011\\"Fisher Communications Launches GalTime in 134 Markets Nationwide\\", press release from Fisher Communications via marketwire.com, 3/1/2011 \\"HeadDrama,\\" which is geared toward advice on mental health concerns, became the second Buzz Brand platform in May 2011.\\"Fisher Launches 'Head Drama' Localized Web Channel,\\" from Broadcasting & Cable, 5/5/2011 All of the \\"Buzz Brand\\" platforms would eventually be phased out, though content from Emotional Mojo, a Mojo Brands- produced program featuring advice on personal development, would be featured on Buzz segments until the shows' 2015 cancellation. On August 6, 2012, The Daily Buzz unveiled what may have been its most noteworthy transition, introducing a new anchor team that featured actor Charles Divins, veteran TV anchor Lisa Spooner, CMT‚Äôs Top 20 Countdown host Lance Smith, and radio personality Jessica Reyes. Original co-host Andrea Jackson remained with the program to host recurring interview segments until October 2013; fellow Buzz veterans Andy Campbell, Mitch English and Kia Malone left the series outright.\\"‚ÄòThe Daily Buzz‚Äô debuts new team Aug. 6,\\" from Orlando Sentinel, July 16, 2012. By the first quarter of 2013, Daily Buzz owner ACME Communications and operator Fisher Communications had been in the process of a gradual exit from the television business (ACME sold its last remaining TV stations in 2012 and would dissolve as a corporation in 2016;Press release from ACME Communications dated 12/20/2016 Fisher was in the process of being merged into Sinclair Broadcast Group). On April 1, 2013, ACME sold The Daily Buzz, its last remaining TV property, to Mojo Brands Media. As part of the transaction, Sinclair began to broadcast Buzz on some of its stations beginning in the 2013-14 season; the group had previously not carried the show, with many of its The CW Television Network, MyNetworkTV, and independent stations preferring to carry E/I or paid programming in their morning time slots instead. =Cancellation (2015)= The Daily Buzz unexpectedly ceased production after its April 17, 2015 episode. In an interview that day with the Orlando Sentinel, Mojo Brands Media COO Troy McGuire noted the cancellation was due to a disagreement with an investor in Mojo, who as a result withdrew their financial support in the company. McGuire did not elaborate further in the interview, citing legal reasons. Details would surface, however, in court documents related to Mojo's Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation filing on May 5, 2015: One creditor of the company, Richard Botnick, had filed suit against Mojo earlier in 2015, alleging the company fell behind on their debt obligations and had defaulted on a loan they made with Botnick. After Botnick's company obtained a garnishment against their bank accounts, Mojo made the decision to immediately cancel Buzz as well as sister program Emotional Mojo.\\"The Daily Buzz ownership company files for bankruptcy,\\" from Orlando Sentinel, 5/5/2015 The cancellations of both The Daily Buzz and Emotional Mojo resulted in the loss of 37 positions involved in the production of both shows, many of whom, it was revealed in Mojo Brands' bankruptcy filing, were still owed money for wages and other expenses. Since Buzzs demise had a sudden, immediate effect, there was no opportunity for an on-air goodbye from the show's staff, who had hoped to reconvene at a later date and deliver an online farewell and thank-you to the show's audience, a plan that would not come to fruition.\\"'Daily Buzz' owner file for bankruptcy after show's abrupt end,\\" from The Desk, 5/5/2015 Buzz, as a daily show, would leave behind a legacy of being, as termed by reviving company KEF Media, \\"the gold standard of combining news, hot topics, and [product] integration in a fun, seamless format.\\" Indeed, by the mid-2010s, many national breakfast television programs, and news programs in general, would begin to utilize a not-as-staid presentation. Nationally, Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends has long incorporated lively banter and opinions; broadcast shows such as Today and Good Morning America would over time begin to increase their own entertainment, pop culture, and \\"water cooler\\" discussion segments; and Tribune Broadcasting would follow suit, launching EyeOpener on a handful of its stations in 2011 and replacing it with the social media-oriented Morning Dose in 2017. =Revival (2017-present)= In May 2017, two years after Mojo Brands Media's bankruptcy led to the cancellation of The Daily Buzz, broadcast and digital public relations company KEF Media announced that it would revive The Daily Buzz, after acquiring the show's trademark and branding.\\"Morning Show 'The Daily Buzz' Comes Back,\\" from Broadcasting & Cable, 5/2/2017 Contradicting its title somewhat, the show would be offered initially to broadcasters as a one-hour, once-per-week series (also available as a half- hour weekly series, as it airs on Youtoo), in addition having daily updates on digital platforms. Additional broadcast and digital airings would eventually be added as the show grows. The Daily Buzz would return to air the weekend of June 18, 2017 (two weekends later than previously announced).\\"The Daily Buzz Adds McBride,\\" from O'Dwyer's, 6/9/2017 As with the original version of the show, The Daily Buzz includes various features on news, pop culture, gossip, entertainment, and other subjects. The show also offers \\"vertical\\" segments on consumer affairs, fashion, finance, healthy, hospitality, sports, and travel, utilizing integration of content from the show's sponsors. The revived Daily Buzz originates from the same studios as the daily version prior to its 2015 cancellation (Full Sail University in Orlando), and is overseen by many of the creative and production personnel from the first incarnation. Two former Buzz hosts have also returned to host the revival, Lance Smith and Kia Malone. Scott Carty (based in Los Angeles) and Josh McBride (based in New York City), joined at the restart as entertainment correspondents, with Howard Henley and Summer Jackson joining later as West Coast and East Coast correspondents respectively.

(The show reached roughly 175 markets at its peak.) Rather than airing on stations affiliated with the Big 3 broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC), which rely on their own newscasts and that of those networks, Buzz was offered and sold to various larger- or-middle-sized markets affiliated with Fox, MyNetworkTV, The CW, or independents such as WRDQ in Orlando, The Daily Buzz's home city.\\"Fisher Expanding 'Daily Buzz' Franchise\\", from tvnewscheck.com, 9/21/2010 In markets where, for various reasons, The Daily Buzz could not be offered to individual stations, the show was featured on the schedules of cable network Youtoo TV as well as that of digital subchannel network Soul of the South; both networks aired the show on late- morning tape-delay. The show was also featured live-to-air on The CW Plus, The CW network's service for small-market stations (roughly those ranked 100 or lower), an arrangement that ended in September 2014. Though many stations that aired The Daily Buzz showed the full 2-hour broadcast live-to-air during the 5 a.m.-7 a.m. (ET) time slot, a few stations carried only one hour of the program, while others tape-delayed all or part of the show for a mid- or late- morning airing (between 7-11 a.m.). The full Daily Buzz broadcast also streamed live-to-air online, weekday mornings between 5:00 a.m.‚Äì7:00 a.m. (ET) through the program's website.Direct link to The Daily Buzz live streaming The show was also uploaded daily post-broadcast to Hulu. During Mojo Brands Media's 2013 acquisition of The Daily Buzz, the company announced plans to distribute the program to international markets in the Caribbean and Latin America. At the time of Buzzs cancellation, it was unclear if or how the show was offered internationally. The 2015 cancellation of The Daily Buzz left the show's affiliates scrambling for replacement programming to fill the abandoned time slots on their schedules, be it other syndicated shows (a route WCWF/Green Bay would take with second airings of The People's Court),\\"The Daily Buzz Cancelled,\\" from CW14Online.com, 4/17/2015 barter lifestyle programming (the route WCGV-TV/Milwaukee would take), paid programming, straight rebroadcasts of a sister station's morning newscast until the fall (which WFNA/Gulf Shores-Mobile, Alabama would do), or their own local content. One Buzz affiliate's program director, commenting to the Orlando Sentinel the day of Buzzs cancellation, felt \\"more than a little steamed\\" that he learned of the show's demise second-hand. Mojo Brands' McGuire, in that same Sentinel interview, noted that his company, for its part, was in the process of notifying and working with Buzz affiliates post-cancellation, suggesting that the show's demise was \\"as unexpected for us as for the affiliates.\\" Note: The below list is a partial compilation of noteworthy Daily Buzz affiliates at the time of the show's 2015 closure and should not be construed a complete list of stations that aired the program.

The first was against President Eduardo Frei Montalva, and the second sought to prevent Socialist Salvador Allende's election. Prior to his involvement in the Ren√© Schneider case, Viaux was a very well respected and admired military leader. He became famous when he led a small military insurrection (the Tacnazo) on October 21, 1969. In the Tacnazo, Viaux shut himself up with the Tacna regiment inside its barracks and went on a strike. He demanded a pay-raise for the Army and the resignation of both the Defense Minister and the Army Commander-in-Chief. After tense negotiations with the government, he ended his strike when the Commander-in- Chief resigned and the government promised to study his salary demands. On October 22, 1970, coup plotters loyal to Viaux attempted to kidnap constitutionalist Chilean Army Commander-in-chief General Ren√© Schneider, who was adamantly opposed to any prospect of a coup. General Schneider's official car was ambushed at a street intersection in the capital city of Santiago, Chile. When the general drew a gun to defend himself, he was shot point-blank several times. Though he was rushed to a military hospital, General Schneider's wounds proved fatal and he died three days later, on October 25. General Viaux was later convicted of involvement with the plot and imprisoned. Critics of U.S. policy in Chile at the time, including journalist Christopher Hitchens, have accused former U.S. National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of conspiring with Viaux in the murder of General Schneider. Yet declassified U.S. documents show that the Central Intelligence Agency had explored the possibility of supporting a Viaux coup but decided that his ideology was \\"far out\\" and, while maintaining contact with him, did not provide direct support. In a declassified October 15 conversation with President Richard Nixon, Kissinger said, \\"This looks hopeless. I turned it off. Nothing could be worse than an abortive coup.\\" Although contact with the Viaux group was ended, a cable from CIA headquarters to the Santiago station reveals that the CIA did arrange the delivery of submachine guns and ammunition to a group led by General Valenzuela; Schneider was shot later that same day.http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/docs/doc27.pdf The weapons, along with $50,000, were later recovered by U.S. military attach√© to Chile Colonel Wilmert after he \\"pistol-whipped\\" General Valenzuela, who at first refused to hand the money over. Wilmert then drove to Vina del Mar, where he threw the submachine guns into the Pacific Ocean. In August, 1973, Viaux was released and exiled to Paraguay. He was not involved in the successful Chilean coup of 1973, and was allowed to return to Chile only in 1990, by President Patricio Aylwin. Viaux lived quietly in retirement in Santiago, until his death on September 5, 2005.

It was chartered in 1885 following a conference in Baltimore led by local leaders of the Methodist Episcopal Church, including John F. Goucher, the school's namesake.https://archive.org/details/historyofgoucher00knip page 10 It was formerly a women's college before becoming coeducational in 1986. , the school had around 1,480 undergraduates studying in 33 majors and six interdisciplinary fields and 700 graduate students. Goucher also grants professional certificates in areas including writing and education and offers a postbaccalaureate premedical program. Originally situated in central Baltimore, Goucher established its current campus in 1953 on a 287-acre plot of land in downtown Towson. Goucher is a member of the Landmark Conference and competes in the NCAA's Division III in sports including lacrosse, tennis, soccer, volleyball, basketball, and horseback riding. Goucher is among the few colleges in the United States to require a study abroad of all undergraduates and was one of forty institutions profiled in Colleges That Change Lives by Loren Pope. Among its alumni are journalist Jonah Goldberg, former First Lady of Puerto Rico Luc√© Vela, Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander of the District Court for the District of Maryland, 27th Vice Commandant of the United States Coast Guard Sally Brice-O'Hara, former president of First Republic Bank Katherine August-DeWilde, and the third president of California State University, San Marcos, Karen S. Haynes. History = 19th century = John F. Goucher, who was the school's co-founder and second president, became its namesake in 1913. In 1881, the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church passed a resolution to found a seminary. The proposal was met with some objection, with one member stating, \\"I would not give a fig for a weakling little thing of a seminary. We want such a school, so ample in its provisions, of such dignity in its buildings, so fully provided with the best apparatus, that it shall draw to itself the eyes of the community and that young people shall feel it an honor to be enrolled among its students.\\" Minister and conference member John B. Van Meter asserted \\"that the Conference [should] make the foundation and endowment of a female college the single object of its organized effort.\\" Van Meter was joined by fellow minister John Franklin Goucher (1845‚Äì1922) and together they eventually persuaded the conference to found a college, instead.Knipp, Anna Heubeck, and Thaddeus P. Thomas. The History of Goucher College. Baltimore: Goucher College, 1938. https://archive.org/details/historyofgoucher00knip Subsequently, the Women's College of Baltimore City (\\"City\\" was later dropped) was chartered on January 26, 1885. It opened its doors in 1888, and four years later graduated its first class of just five students. John F. Goucher, despite being the school's namesake and his role in its founding, was not the college's first president. Although offered the post, he declined, and it instead went to William Hersey Hopkins, who had served as president of St. John's College in Annapolis. After Hopkins resigned in 1890 to join the faculty, the board of trustees voted unanimously to renominate Goucher for the role. Under pressure from the board, Goucher relented and accepted the position, which he went on to hold for nearly two decades. Goucher and his wife Mary Cecilia Fisher also made significant financial contributions to the college, to which he bequeathed a portion of his estate. = 20th century = During President Goucher's tenure, the college's enrollment grew but it also suffered financial deficits. In 1904, the college became the second in Maryland to establish a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, after Johns Hopkins University. Goucher stepped down in 1908 to resume his international missionary work but remained involved with the school as president emeritus until his death in 1922. In 1910, the school was renamed Goucher College in his honor. In 1913, the college inaugurated its fourth president, William W. Guth, who oversaw the construction of several new residence halls and a successful million-dollar fundraising campaign. A colorized postcard photo of Goucher's Baltimore campus circa 1920 Around this time, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, whose daughter Jessie was a Goucher alumna, expressed support for the college's fundraising efforts in correspondences with the administration, writing in March 1913, \\"It would, indeed, be... evidence that our great educational public does not fully understand its own interests if an institution which has served with such faithfulness... in the cause of woman's [sic] education should be allowed to break up for the lack of money.\\" By 1914, Goucher was one of six \\"Class I\\" colleges for women in the U.S. In 1921, Goucher purchased 421 acres of land in nearby Towson that had belonged to the estate of a prominent Baltimore family for $150,000, some of which was later resold to provide funding for construction and other expenses. The move from Baltimore to the Towson suburbs was completed in 1953 after having been delayed by financial difficulties imposed by the Great Depression and World War II. The college's original seal Before 1950, Goucher hosted nearly a dozen sorority chapters on campus including Kappa Kappa Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Gamma Phi Beta, and Pi Beta Phi. The school has since ceased recognizing an on-campus Greek system. Goucher became coeducational in 1986 when the board of trustees voted to admit men, citing declining enrollment and reduced national interest by women in single-sex colleges. Although the decision was at first controversial among some students and alumnae, it was followed by increased enrollment and sustained support from the school's donor base, with Goucher's endowment growing nearly five-fold from $45 million in 1986. Then-president Rhoda M. Dorsey, who also initially resisted the proposal, presided over the transition. Goucher's former Baltimore campus is now known as Old Goucher. The school no longer maintains any affiliation with the property since its sale. The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Many of its original structures, characterized by Romanesque influences, have been preserved and re-purposed for commercial, public, and residential use. The school's Towson campus was added to the historic register in 2007. Campus A view down Van Meter Road Goucher occupies a green, wooded campus that is proximate and northeast to downtown Towson. Surrounding the central campus infrastructure is a dense forest, owned by the school, which features low hills and hiking and jogging trails. The non-denominational Haebler Memorial Chapel lies near the center of campus. A single road, Van Meter, connects to most of the college's residential, academic, recreational, and athletic buildings. Newsweek magazine described the campus as \\"unusually bucolic.\\" It has also been referred to by CBS Baltimore as one of Baltimore County‚Äôs most scenic college campuses. A scene at the fictional Hammond University from the fourth season of the Netflix series House of Cards was filmed on Goucher's campus, with most shots taking place at the Athenaeum and the Rhoda M. Dorsey College Center. = Academic buildings = The main entrance to the Sanford J. Ungar Athenaeum Goucher's main academic buildings, including Van Meter Hall and Julia Rogers, are located at the northern portion of campus, called the \\"academic quad\\". The Hoffberger Science Building houses the school's science departments and is adjacent to the Meyerhoff Arts Building, which contains a theater, photo studio, and several galleries and out of which the dance, theater, and art departments are based. Student Administrative Services and the admissions office are located in the Rhoda M. Dorsey College Center. Near the center of the campus and opposite Mary Fisher Hall is the Athenaeum, or \\"the Ath,\\" a modern, multipurpose facility built in 2009, comprising the main library, an on-campus restaurant, exercise equipment, classrooms, lecture halls, and an open auditorium. The Athenaeum is where speakers who visit the campus are typically hosted. The Merrick Lecture Hall, a partial amphitheater situated near Van Meter Hall, is also a regular venue for on-campus recitals, performances, sponsored political debates, and other productions. = Housing and residential halls = left The college's residence halls are concentrated on the south side of campus. They are Heubeck, Froelicher, Stimson, Mary Fisher, Sondheim, Stimson, Welsh Hall, known by students as \\"the T\\" for its T-shaped design, which was completed in 2005, and the newer Pagliaro Selz Hall, completed in 2016. In 2018, the school completed construction of the \\"First-year Village\\" for freshmen. Campus housing for students includes singles, doubles, triples, suites, and on-campus apartments. Sondheim is the sole residence hall designated as substance-free. In July 2018, Goucher announced a campus-wide ban on cigarettes and all smoking devices, including electronic cigarettes. = Athletic and recreational facilities = The campus's outdoor sports facilities include a 107,000 square foot turf stadium field known on campus as Gopher Stadium, a track, eight tennis courts as well as separate courts for racquetball and squash, and an equestrian center. The Decker Sports and Recreation Center contains a six-lane, 25-yard pool, dance studios, a basketball court, gymnasium, varsity locker rooms, a fully equipped weight room, and a cardio fitness center. The equestrian center lies on the northernmost edge of campus and contains a set of stables and a riding arena. Welsh Hall, also known as \\"the T\\" = Design, layout, and sustainability = left The architectural design firm responsible for planning the campus, Moore and Hutchins, elected to group buildings together into informal zones based on function, departing from the Romanesque style of the previous Baltimore campus. The buildings on campus are clad in tan-colored Butler stone, which was chosen to reflect a Modernist theme. Over the years, the architecture of the campus has won numerous awards. The campus has also been recognized for its commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency, being called a \\"Top 25 Green College.\\" In 2009, Goucher announced a goal for all new and existing buildings to achieve at least a Silver rating according to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification system. In 2007, the campus was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The campus underwent significant changes when in 2017 several of its primary residential buildings were relocated as part of an extensive plan to construct a \\"First-year Village\\" comprising modernized residential halls and recreational facilities for newly matriculated freshmen. The new freshmen dorms have a capacity of 450 and opened in the fall of 2018. These developments coincided with substantial renovations to Mary Fisher Hall, with its campus cafe upgraded to a full-fledged, 550-seat dining hall. Goucher also announced plans to build a new Science Research Center to provide additional lab space and resources for expanded biology, chemistry, and environmental science departments. In order to raise capital for these projects, Goucher initiated a fundraising campaign to raise $100 million from alumni and other donors, of which it has raised $43 million to date. Academics = Rankings and reputation = In the U.S. News & World Report annual college rankings for 2021, Goucher tied for 120th among national liberal arts colleges, 11th in Most Innovative Schools, 72nd in Social Mobility, and 5th in Study Abroad. Forbes in 2019 ranked Goucher at 138 in Liberal Arts Universities, 161 in the Northeast, 272 nationally among private colleges, and 410 overall among the best 650 colleges and universities in the U.S. Washington Monthly ranked Goucher 67th among liberal arts colleges in 2019. The Princeton Review included Goucher in its 2019 edition of the \\"Best 384 Colleges\\" and ranked it No. 1 in \\"Most Popular Study Abroad Program.‚Äù Goucher was recognized as a top producer of Fulbright scholars by The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2018. It was also profiled in the book Colleges that Change Lives by Loren Pope as one of forty institutions. The school was one of the first in the country to require a study abroad of all undergraduates, along with Susquehanna University and Soka University of America. = Admissions = Goucher's admissions process is rated as \\"selective\\" by U.S. News and World Report. For the class of 2022, Goucher received 3,474 applications and had an acceptance rate of 79%. Goucher has been SAT-optional since 2006. In 2014, the school received national coverage when it announced it would accept video-only applications without transcripts, essays, or test scores. The decision was criticized by some who suggested that doing so represented a lowering of standards. The school defended the decision as part of an effort to increase diversity among the student body and later reported that the average GPA of students admitted via the video application process met or exceeded that of students who submitted traditional applications. =Undergraduate level= As of 2018, students choose from 33 different majors and six interdisciplinary programs; there are also special orientation courses for first-year students. The most popular majors are in the humanities and social sciences, languages, biological sciences, and performing arts. Goucher is also well-known for its creative writing, dance, and pre-med departments. The student-faculty ratio is 10:1, and the average class size is 17. Goucher is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Goucher began requiring all undergraduates to study abroad in 2006, which was the most notable of several reforms to the school's curriculum in that period. A popular choice for students is a three-week course abroad during the winter, spring, or summer. Goucher offers over 60 semester and yearlong study-abroad programs in 30 countries but allows students to register in programs by other schools. Undergraduates are also expected to either complete an internship, participate in community engagement work, or work as a faculty research assistant. Goucher sponsors a competitive grant program for students participating in summer internships. In 2017, Goucher instituted a revamped set of general education requirements into the curriculum called \\"Goucher Commons\\" including a first-year seminar, emphasis on writing, data analytics, and foreign language and culture, a capstone course, and inquiry into at least two areas. In 2018, Goucher announced plans to eliminate seven majors, including mathematics, physics, religion, music, and Russian studies, following a \\"Program Prioritization Process\\" involving faculty which cited low overall interest in those majors among students. The school said that advanced courses in these subjects will remain part of the overall curriculum and that the class of 2022 and students that were studying in those majors will be unaffected by the change. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan speaks with students in the Athenaeum =Graduate level= Goucher's graduate program is run out of the Welch Center for Graduate and Professional Studies, which is named for late former acting president Robert S. Welch. The school grants Master of Arts, Master of Education, and Master of Fine Arts degrees in fields including art and technology and historic preservation. =Certificate and other programs= Since 1993, Goucher has offered a full- time post-baccalaureate pre-medical program with 96% of students over the course of its history gaining acceptance to medical school and 99.7% over the past decade. The program accepts approximately 32 students annually. It has linkage agreements with several schools including the University of Pennsylvania, Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Michigan, Alpert Medical School, George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, Stony Brook, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Hofstra, and the University of Pittsburgh. Goucher also grants certificates through a program for teachers called the AP (Advanced Placement) Summer Institute recognizing specialties with at-risk learners, middle school, reading instruction, improving school leadership, and educational technology. In 2012, Goucher was one of 67 colleges selected by the Department of Education to participate in the Second Chance Pell Grant pilot program to provide prison inmates the opportunity to earn college credits and work towards a bachelor's degree. The program is run through the Goucher Prison Education Partnership, a separate division of the college that operates on funds provided through the federal government as well as private donations. Student life =Clubs and extracurriculars= Goucher has over 60 student- run clubs including the Chem Club, which is the oldest continuously operating club on campus, Hillel, an a capella group called Red Hot Blue, a poetry club, a black student union called Umoja, Model United Nations, and a student-labor action committee. The college also publishes a bi-weekly student newspaper called The Quindecim and a literary arts journal called Preface. Other media run by the school is Goucher Student Radio, which contains a host of student, staff, and faculty programming and is streamed online. Many students also participate in Goucher Student Government, which holds elections, oversees the activities of clubs, passes resolutions, and votes on matters affecting the general student body. Similar to several other private liberal arts schools in the northeast, Goucher does not recognize any fraternities or sororities on campus. =Athletics= alt= Goucher's athletic teams are known as the Gophers. In 2007 the college joined the Landmark Conference after competing as a member of the Capital Athletic Conference from 1991 to 2007. Goucher competes in the NCAA's Division III, fielding men's and women's teams in lacrosse, soccer, basketball, track and field, cross country, swimming, and tennis, as well as women's teams in field hockey and volleyball. Goucher also competes nationally in co-ed equestrian sports through the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association. =Demographics= Goucher has a high female-male ratio: approximately 68% of undergraduates are female. About 35% of the student body identifies as African-American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native- American. Goucher also has one of the highest percentages of Jewish students in the country at 31% according to Hillel International. Goucher attracts students both nationally and internationally; undergraduates in 2017 came from 46 states and 50 countries. Twenty-five percent of students qualify for Pell Grants, and Goucher has been recognized for its success in graduating Pell Grant recipients as compared to the national average. For the class of 2021, the top five represented home states were Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and California, and 24% of the incoming class were first- generation college students. =Other activities on campus= Goucher has, in the past, hosted the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth summer program for gifted students. The school also regularly conducts the Goucher Poll, which operates under the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center. The polling is performed by Goucher students out of a 40-station computer-aided telephone interviewer lab. Goucher students are credited with conceiving the nationally popular campus game Humans vs. Zombies, which is organized by students annually, and the commercial party game Cards Against Humanity. Another of the school's annual traditions is known as GIG, \\"Get into Goucher,\\" in which students participate in campus-wide celebrations, concerts, and other festivities. Goucher also hosts English as a second language and computer literacy classes under a program called the Futuro Latino Learning Center, run by students and college instructors. Notable faculty and alumni Well-known Goucher faculty and professors emeritus include Jean H. Baker and Julie Roy Jeffrey of the history department, Nancy Hubbard from the business and accounting department, president emeritus Sanford J. Ungar, and authors Madison Smartt Bell and Elizabeth Spires, who oversee the college's Kratz Center for Creative Writing. Goucher has over 21,000 living alumni, and many of its graduates have gone on to make contributions in the arts and literature, sciences, journalism, business, academia, government, and other fields.

It is based on the play Orfeu da Concei√ß√£o by Vinicius de Moraes, which is itself an adaptation of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, set in the modern context of a favela in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval. The film was an international co-production among production companies in Brazil, France and Italy. The film is particularly noted for its soundtrack by two Brazilian composers: Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, whose song \\"A felicidade\\" opens the film; and Luiz Bonf√°, whose \\"Manh√£ de Carnaval\\" and \\"Samba de Orfeu\\" have become classics of bossa nova. The songs sung by the character Orfeu were dubbed by singer Agostinho dos Santos. Lengthy passages of the film were shot in the Morro da Babil√¥nia, a favela in the Leme neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro.Valladares, Licia. Social Science Representations of Favelas in Rio De Janeiro: A Historical Perspective.Bellos, Alex. \\"Movie palace\\", The Guardian (14 January 2006). Plot A marble Greek bas relief explodes to reveal black men dancing the samba to drums in a favela. Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (L√©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man - Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume - finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death. When Serafina's sailor boyfriend Chico (Waldemar De Souza) shows up, Orfeu offers to let Eurydice sleep in his home, while he takes the hammock outside. Eurydice invites him to her bed. Orfeu, Mira, and Serafina are the principal members of a samba school, one of many parading during Carnival. Serafina decides to have Eurydice dress in her costume so that she can spend more time with her sailor. A veil conceals Eurydice's face; only Orfeu is told of the deception. During the parade, Orfeu dances with Eurydice rather than Mira. Eventually, Mira spots Serafina among the spectators and rips off Eurydice's veil. Eurydice is forced once again to run for her life first from Mira, then from Death. Trapped in Orfeu's own trolley station, she hangs from a power line to get away from Death and is killed accidentally by Orfeu when he turns the power on and electrocutes her. Death tells Orfeu \\"Now she's mine,\\" before knocking him out. Distraught, Orfeu looks for Eurydice at the Office of Missing Persons, although Hermes has told him she is dead. The building is deserted at night, with only a janitor sweeping up. He tells Orfeu that the place holds only papers and that no people can be found there. Taking pity on Orfeu, the janitor takes him down a large darkened spiral staircase - a reference to the mythical Orpheus' descent into the underworld - to a Macumba ritual, a regional form of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candombl√©. At the gate, there is a dog named Cerberus, after the three-headed dog of Hades in Greek mythology. During the ritual, the janitor tells Orfeu to call to his beloved by singing. The spirit of Eurydice inhabits the body of an old woman and speaks to him. Orfeu wants to gaze upon her, but Eurydice begs him not to lest he lose her forever. When he turns and looks anyway, he sees the old woman, and Eurydice's spirit departs, as in the Greek myth. Orfeu wanders in mourning. He retrieves Eurydice's body from the city morgue and carries her in his arms across town and up the hill toward his home, where his shack is burning. A vengeful Mira, running amok, flings a stone that hits him in the head and knocks him over a cliff to his death with Eurydice still in his arms. Two children, Benedito and Zeca - who have followed Orfeu throughout the film - believe Orfeu's tale that his guitar playing causes the sun to rise every morning. After Orfeu's death, Benedito insists that Zeca pick up the guitar and play so that the sun will rise. Zeca plays, and the sun comes up. A little girl appears, gives Zeca a single flower, and the three children dance.

Mello was walking on the street in Rio de Janeiro, when director Marcel Camus stopped him and asked if he would like to be in a film. * Da Silva, the actor who played Death, was a triple jumper who won two Olympic gold medals, in 1952 and 1956. * The role of Zeca was played by Aurino Cassiano, a young musician from a large musical family. With brother Amaury on cavaquinho and Aurino on pandeiro, they performed in the streets, calling themselves \\"Dupla Chuvisco\\". In 1957, they were invited to perform in a film, Pega Ladr√£o, and then Aurino appeared in another, Vai que √© Mole. It was during the filming of Vai que √© Mole that Marcel Camus saw Aurino performing on location, and invited him to test for Black Orpheus. Awards and honors Black Orpheus won the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, the 1960 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the 1960 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Film and was nominated for the 1961 BAFTA Award for Best Film.

Miliaria is a common ailment in hot and humid conditions, such as in the tropics and during the summer season. Although it affects people of all ages, it is especially common in children and infants due to their underdeveloped sweat glands. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of miliaria include small red rashes, called papules, which are irritated and itchy. These may simultaneously occur at a number of areas on a sufferer's body, the most common including the upper chest, neck, elbow creases, under the breasts and under the scrotum. Other areas include skin folds, areas of the body that may rub against clothing, such as the back, chest, and stomach. A related and sometimes simultaneous condition is folliculitis, where hair follicles become plugged with foreign matter, resulting in inflammation. The symptoms relating to miliaria should not be confused with shingles as they can be very similar. Shingles will restrict itself to one side of the body but also has a rash-like appearance. It is also accompanied by a prickling sensation and pain throughout the region. Those who suspect they have shingles and not miliaria should seek medical advice immediately as the sooner antivirals are taken, the better. Types Miliaria can be classified according to the top level at which obstruction occurs in the sweat glands. =Miliaria crystalline= The most superficial obstruction (with the most mild clinical presentation), is known as miliaria crystalline; instead of a rash, the patient presents with multiple tiny blister-like lesions that look like beads of perspiration and essentially cause no symptoms. Miliaria crystalline is also known as \\"Miliaria crystallina,\\" and \\"Sudamina\\". The superficial vesicles are not associated with an inflammatory reaction. =Miliaria rubra= The most commonly encountered form of the illness is miliaria rubra, in which obstruction causes leakage of sweat into the deeper layers of the epidermis, provoking a local inflammatory reaction and giving rise to the typical appearance of redness (hence rubra) and larger (but still only a few millimetres), blister-like lesions. This form of the illness is often accompanied by the typical symptoms‚Äîintense itching or \\"pins and needles\\" with a lack of sweating (anhidrosis) to affected areas. There is a small risk of heat exhaustion due to inability to sweat if the rash affects a large proportion of the body's surface area or the sufferer continues to engage in heat-producing activity. Miliaria rubra is also known as prickly heat and heat rash. Differential diagnosis should be used to rule out polycythemia vera, which is a rare hematological disorder and appears more often in males than females, generally not before the age of 40. Both disorders share the common denominator of appearing after taking a hot shower. =Miliaria profunda= The most severe form of miliaria, miliaria profunda, sometimes referred to as \\"wildfire\\" due to the rapid spread and severe burning sensations, generally occurs as a complication of repeated episodes of miliaria rubra. The obstruction is deep in the structure of the sweat gland, causing the gland's secretions to leak between the superficial and deep layers of the skin. The rash, and associated symptoms, tend to appear within hours of an activity provoking sweating but similarly fade within hours when the stimulus for the sweating is removed. Miliaria profunda is characterised by non-pruritic, flesh-coloured, deep-seated, whitish papules. The rash tends to be flesh-coloured as opposed to the prominent redness of miliaria rubra, and the risk of heat exhaustion is larger. Miliaria profunda is also less-commonly known as \\"mammillaria\\" G.O. Horne, F.R.C.P.E.‚Ä† and R.H. Mole, M.A., B.M., M.R.C.P., Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg (1951) 44 (4): 465-471. doi: 10.1016/S0035-9203(51)80023-3 =Miliaria pustulosa= Miliaria pustulosa describes pustules due to inflammation and bacterial infection. Miliaria pustulosa is preceded by another dermatitis that has produced injury, destruction, or blocking of the sweat duct. =Postmiliarial hypohidrosis= Postmiliarial hypohidrosis is a skin condition that results from occlusion of sweat ducts and pores, and may be severe enough to impair an individual's ability to perform sustained work in a hot environment. =Tropical anhidrotic asthenia= Tropical anhidrotic asthenia is a skin condition, a rare form of miliaria, with long-lasting poral occlusion, which produces anhidrosis and heat retention. =Occlusion miliaria= Occlusion miliaria is a skin condition that is accompanied by anhidrosis and increased heat-stress susceptibility, all after the application of extensive polyethylene film occlusion for 48 hours or longer. =Colloid milium= Colloid milium is a skin condition characterized by a translucent, flesh-colored, or slightly yellow 1- to 5-mm papule. Pathophysiology Miliaria occurs when the sweat gland ducts get clogged due to dead skin cells or bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common bacterium that occurs on the skin which is also associated with acne. The trapped sweat leads to irritation (prickling), itching and to a rash of very small blisters, usually in a localized area of the skin. Prevention Prickly heat can be prevented by avoiding activities that induce sweating, using air conditioning to cool the environment, wearing light clothing and in general, avoiding hot and humid weather. Frequent cool showers or cool baths with mild soap can help to prevent heat rash. Treatment The primary remedy for prickly heat or rash is to wear lighter clothing, or otherwise avoid overheating one's body. The immediate treatment of the involved skin areas involves the use of a soothing ointment such as calamine lotion. Talcum powder may be used in some cases. Medical assistance should be sought for the first episode of a rash with the appearance of miliaria. The differential diagnosis includes several conditions that an experienced practitioner should be able to recognise and may require treatment distinct from the usual measures taken for miliaria. In most cases, the rash of miliaria will resolve without intervention. However, severe cases can last for weeks and cause significant disability. General measures should be recommended for all patients, including moving to an air-conditioned environment if possible, avoiding sweat-provoking activities and occlusive clothing, and taking frequent cool showers. It has been suggested that the use of topical antibacterials (including antibacterial soaps) may shorten the duration of symptoms in miliaria rubra even in the absence of obvious superinfection. Other topical agents that may reduce the severity of symptoms include anti-itch preparations such as calamine or menthol- or camphor-based preparations, and topical steroid creams. However, caution should be used with oil-based preparations (ointments and oily creams as opposed to water-based or aqueous lotions) that may increase blockage to the sweat glands and prolong the duration of illness. Other agents have been investigated including supplemental vitamin A and C and vitamin A based medications, but it is worth noting that there is little scientific evidence supporting any of the above treatments in reducing the duration of symptoms or frequency of complications. In most tropical areas the local dispensaries sell prickly heat powder, a talc admixture containing drying milk proteins (Labilin) and Triclosan to fight the infection. These include cooling menthol to help alleviate difficulty getting to sleep. This is an effective treatment‚Äîthe powder stays on the skin longer and treats bacteria dispersed into bed linens, providing a reasonably dry refuge area for healing. Miliaria often covers large areas, and generous use of Cortisone may be contraindicated for reasons stated on package warnings. Regular talcum powder will not reduce the rash but can alleviate burning and itching. In cases where the rash has developed into open blisters or pustular lesions a doctor should be consulted since more aggressive, medically monitored treatment may be required.

The grey material is of a higher density than the red material, causing the center of mass of the object (labelled C) to be very low. This means that when the Weeble is wobbled, as in position B, the center of mass will be on the other side of the pivot point (where the Weeble is in contact with the ground), and so gravity will cause it to return to an upright position. Weeble is shaped like an egg‚Äîin order for the physics principles to work as intended, the shape must have a bottom which is a more or less smooth (unfaceted) hemisphere (to allow the Weeble to roll) and from the central vertical axis the shape must be nearly cylindrically symmetrical (that is, any plane cut through the vertical axis line must produce close to the same profile). Next, the shape must be filled with two basic types of unmixed solids, and the volume of the lighter solid must be greater than that of the heavier solid. Next, the overall shape must have constant positive curvature. Next, the relationship between the heavy solid and the light solid must be such that any orientation of the object off of the vertical axis line must cause the object's centroid to raise and to become offset. Lastly, the object must have only one position in which it can achieve stable mechanical equilibrium. Combining these characteristics produces a basic Weeble. In theory, it is not possible to have a Weeble with a centroid that is too low to achieve a stable mechanical equilibrium.  List of playsets  Numerous playsets were made and marketed in the United States throughout the 1970s including a Haunted House, Treehouse, Tarzan, Camper, Playground, Marina, Circus, Fun House, Mickey Mouse Club Set, Mickey Mouse Magic Kingdom, Western Theme Set, Weekender and others. Playsets often came with certain figures, though these could also be purchased separately. There are 44 Weebles sets that include at least one Weebles figure and a vehicle, or larger sets made between 1972 and 1982. A new line of Weebles was created in 2004 that were not egg-shaped but rather shaped like different animals. These were produced for a couple of years. =Weebleville (2004-2005)= Source:WEEBLES ‚Äì browse on Playskool web site *Weebleville Town Center *Weeschool *Wegetable Stand *Weebles Barn Dance *Weehicles (four sets) *Weemobile *Wescue Wagon *Weegoaway Camper *Weebly Wobbly Tree House *Figures *Mini Weebles Pals (larger figures) =Storybook World (2006) = Source: *Hansel and Gretel's Wobbly Adventure *Jack and Jill's Wobbly Adventure *Goldilocks' Adventure Cottage *Cinderella Carriage *Weebly Knight & Ogre Adventure *Weebalot Castle *Figures = New Weebles (2011‚Äìpresent) = * Musical Treehouse * Wobble-Go-Round * Figures * Weebles on the Bus * Bobblin' Boat * Wobblin' Wings * Turnin' Whirlin' Racers * Turn 'n Tumble Home * Rock 'n Wobble Playground  See also  * Weebl and Bob * Okiagari-koboshi * Daruma doll * G√∂mb√∂c References 1970s toys Toy figurines Hasbro products ","title":"Weeble"},{"id":"1214394","text":"OUS may refer to: *Oregon University System *Oxford Union Society *Ohio University Southern Campus *Open University of Sudan ","title":"OUS"},{"id":"1214398","text":"The Short Films of David Lynch (2002) is a DVD collection of the early student and commissioned film work of American filmmaker David Lynch.

Originally untitled, \\"Six Men Getting Sick\\" is a one-minute color animated film that consists of six loops shown on a sculptured screen of three human- shaped figures (based on casts of Lynch's own head as done by Jack Fisk) that intentionally distorted the filmLynch and Rodley 2005. Lynch's animation depicted six people getting sick: their stomachs grew and their heads would catch fire. Lynch made this film during his second year at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art. The school held an experimental painting and sculpture exhibit every year and Lynch entered his work in the Spring of 1966. The animated film was shown on \\"an Erector-set rig on top of the projector so that it would take the finished film through the projector, way up to the ceiling and then back down, so the film would keep going continuously in a loop. And then I hung the sculptured screen and moved the projector back till just what I wanted was on the screen and the rest fell back far enough to disappear\\" (Chris Rodley, editor of Lynch on Lynch). Lynch showed the whole thing with the sound of a siren as accompaniment. The film cost $200 and was not intended to have any successors. It was merely an experiment on Lynch's part because he wanted to see his paintings move.  The Alphabet  The Alphabet (1968) combines animation and live action and goes for four minutes. It has a simple narrative structure relating a symbolically rendered expression of a fear of learning.Lynch and Rodley 2005 The idea for The Alphabet came from Lynch's wife, Peggy Lentz, a painter whose niece, according to Lynch in Chris Rodley's Lynch on Lynch book, \\"was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started The Alphabet going.\\" Based on the merits of this short film, Lynch was awarded an American Film Institute production grant and became a minor celebrity.  The Grandmother  The Grandmother (1970, 33 minutes). After the success of The Alphabet, one of Lynch's friends, Bushnell Keeler, recommended that he check out the American Film Institute.Lynch and Rodley 2005 Keeler's brother-in-law had been involved in setting up the AFI. Lynch submitted The Alphabet, and wrote a script for a short film entitled The Grandmother. He sent the script and a print of The Alphabet to the AFI in Washington. Lynch got a call from George Stevens Jr. and Tony Vellani at the AFI, who wanted to know if Lynch could make The Grandmother for $5,000 (it eventually cost $7,200). The short film combines live action and animation. The story revolves around a boy who grows a grandmother to escape neglect and abuse from his parents. It is mostly silent with only occasional vocal outbursts of gibberish and soundtrack cues used to convey story. The music in the film was provided by a local group known as Tractor, and marked the first time Lynch would work with Alan Splet, who was recommended to the filmmaker by the soundman of The Alphabet. Initially, Lynch and Splet intended to use a collection of sound effects records for the film, but after going through them all they found that none of them were useful. So, Lynch and Splet took sixty-three days to make and record their own sound effects. After finishing The Grandmother, Lynch took the film to be shown at the AFI in Washington, D.C. The head of the AFI at the time, George Stevens, Jr. found that after all the films had been categorized, only Lynch's defied easy categorization. Stevens and Vellani recommended that Lynch apply to the AFI's Center for Advanced Film Studies. This was a filmmaking conservatory that Vellani had recently started in Beverly Hills. Lynch and Splet both applied for scholarships, and on the strength of The Grandmother (which won awards at film festivals in Atlanta, Bellevue and San Francisco), they were accepted into the program.  The Amputee  The Amputee (1974) was made for the American Film Institute while Eraserhead was in financial limbo.Lynch and Rodley 2005 The AFI was testing two different stocks of black and white video, and enlisted Frederick Elmes to test each one. Lynch asked Elmes if he could shoot something with this stock, and he allowed him, so Lynch and Catherine Coulson stayed up all night writing the script. The result was a one shot scene with Catherine Coulson about a woman attempting to write a letter while a nurse (played by Lynch) tends to her leg stumps.

It has become famous as the last residence of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, whose assassination in Sarajevo triggered World War I. The bullet that killed him, fired by Gavrilo Princip, is now an exhibit at the castle's remote museum.  History  The castle as seen from the lake The castle was apparently established in the 1280s by Prague Bishop Tobia≈° as a Gothic fortification in the style of a French castle with a rectangular plan and round towers protruding from the corners, making the most effective defence possible.Di Luca, Mark Czech Republic: The Bradt Travel Guide, pg. 140, Bradt Travel Guides (2006), Accounts show that the Bene≈°√©vic family from nearby Bene≈°ov were the owners in 1318, and that in 1327 the castle passed into the hands of the ≈†ternberks. In 1468, it was conquered by the troops of George of Podƒõbrady after a siege that lasted almost two years. In 1603, the estate was purchased by Dorota Hodƒõjovsk√° of Hodƒõjov, who made Renaissance alterations to the old gothic fortification.Ehrenberger, Toma≈° The Most Beautiful 88 Castles, pg. 72, Kartografie Praha a.s., The Hodƒõjovsk√Ω family fortified their property because of their active participation in the anti-Habsburg rebellion in 1620. Albrecht von Waldstein acquired the castle, and after him it was passed to Adam Michna of Vac√≠nov. Michna gained notoriety through his repression of the serfs, who revolted against him and conquered Konopi≈°tƒõ in 1657. The Swedes occupied and plundered Konopi≈°tƒõ in 1648, and the Vrtba family then purchased the dilapidated structure. After 1725, they had it transformed into a Baroque style ch√¢teau. The drawbridge was replaced by a stone bridge, and near the east tower a new entrance was inserted in the wall. The gate which embellished it was designed by Franti≈°ek Maxmili√°n Ka≈àka and featured statues from the workshop of Matthias Bernard Braun. In 1746, the upper levels of four of the towers were destroyed and one tower was completely demolished. During repair of the interiors, mythological and allegorical frescoes were painted on the ceilings of the great hall, and marble fireplaces with carved decorations by Lazar Wildmann were created. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria bought Konopi≈°tƒõ in 1887 with his inheritance from the last reigning Duke of Modena. He had it repaired between 1889 and 1894 by the architect Josef Mocker into a luxurious residence, suitable for a future Emperor, which he preferred to his official residence in Vienna. The extensive 225 ha (550-acre) English-style park, with terraces, a rose garden and statues, was established at the same time. He invited Wilhelm II, German Kaiser to see his roses early in June 1914. Insofar as they discussed politics, they discussed Romania, but undocumented conspiracy theories about their planning an attack on Serbia or a division of the Austro-Hungarian Empire arose at the time.Sidney Bradshaw Fay, Origins of the World War. Since 1921, the castle has been the property of the Czechoslovak and later Czech state, one of 90 such properties in state ownership. The Ministry of Culture was said to spend more than US$800,000 per year to maintain the castle, and it recovers about as much from entrance ticket sales and rental fees for occasional functions. In 2000, 'Princess' Sophie von Hohenberg, great-granddaughter of Franz Ferdinand and his morganatic wife Sophie von Hohenberg, filed a lawsuit seeking restitution of the castle to the Hohenberg family, which however was never recognized as part of the House of Habsburg.\\"Smith, Craig S. Princess and Heir of Franz Ferdinand Fights to Repeal a Law and Gain a Castle\\" New York Times, February 19, 2007 The lawsuit, filed in Bene≈°ov (former German name: Beneschau), sought restitution of the castle, of woodland and a brewery.  Tourist attractions  Konopi≈°tƒõ has been open to the public since 1971. Visitors can observe the residential rooms of Franz Ferdinand, who was also an enthusiastic hunter, a large collection of antlers, the \\"Obizzi-Este collection\\" (the third largest European collection of armoury and medieval weapons from Castello del Catajo, Padua, Italy), a shooting hall with moving targets, and a garden with Italian Renaissance statues and greenhouses. The castle can be toured from April to October. It is accessible by train from Prague to Bene≈°ov (about a one-hour ride) and then by a walk of about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) from the station, or by one of the infrequent buses.

Viruthachalam (25 April 1906 ‚Äì 5 May 1948),, better known by the pseudonym Pudhumaipithan (also spelt as Pudumaipithan or Puthumaippiththan), was one of the most influential and revolutionary writers of Tamil fiction. His works were characterized by social satire, progressive thinking and outspoken criticism of accepted conventions. Contemporary writers and critics found it difficult to accept his views and his works were received with extreme hostility. He as an individual and his works have been extensively reviewed and debated for over sixty years since his death. His influence has been accepted and appreciated by the present day writers and critics of Tamil fiction.Pudumaipithan's literary legacy remembered, The Hindu 7 May 2007Tamil is not language of just a region, says President Kalam, The Hindu 19 Dec 2006 In 2002, the Government of Tamil Nadu nationalised the works of Pudumaippithan.A heart for Art, The Hindu 25 September 2003 Life and career Pudhumaipithan was born in Thiruppadirippuliyur (Cuddalore district) in a Tirunelveli Saiva Pillai family.Puthumaipithan ‚Äì His Contribution to Modern Tamil Literature His early education was obtained in places like Gingee, Kallakurichi and Tindivanam. He completed his Bachelor of Arts Degree from Tirunelveli Hindu college in 1931. In the same year he married Kamala and moved to Madras. His career as a writer began in 1933 with an essay \\"Gulabjaan Kaadhal\\" (Love for Gulab jamun) published in the magazine Gandhi. His first short story \\"Aatrangarai Pillaiyaar\\" (Pillaiyaar on the river bank) was published in 1934 in \\"Manikodi\\" and from then on his short stories appeared regularly in it. His short stories appeared in a number of magazines like Kalaimakal, Jothi, Sudantira Chanku, Oozhiyan and Thamizh Mani and the annual issue of Dina Mani. He worked briefly as a sub editor at Oozhiyan and later at Dina Mani. In 1943, he left Dina Mani to join Dinasari. He later become the president of India. Remembering Pudumaippithan ‚Äì Frontline Magazine 08-21 April 2006 In 1940, his book \\"Pudhumaipithan Kadhaigal\\"(The stories of Pudhumaipithan), an anthology of his short stories was published. He slowly ventured into the world of Tamil cinema and worked as a scriptwriter in the films Avvaiyaar and KaamaValli. In 1945, he started \\"Parvatha Kumari Productions\\" and made an abortive attempt at producing a film called \\"Vasanthavalli\\".Dinathanthi Film History Series by Ko.Vi. Manisekaran ‚Äì Essay No.777 (in Tamil) While working for the movie \\"Raja Mukthi\\", in Pune he contracted tuberculosis. He died on 5 May 1948 at Thiruvananthapuram. Works and themes Manikodi magazine Pudumaippithan's active writing period was less than 15 years (1934‚Äì46) in which he wrote nearly 100 short stories, an equal number of essays on a variety of subjects, 15 poems, a few plays and scores of book reviews. His writings gave him a reputation as a maverick. His works were influenced by the French short story writer Guy de Maupassant among others.The subjects he wrote on and the characters he chose to portray were completely new to Tamil fiction. He felt that Tamil literature had been crippled by unspoken conventions and openly criticized those who adhered to them. In one of his essays he expressed his displeasure as: He was unfazed by the hostile reception that his works received from contemporary writers and critics alike. Dismissing his critics, he wrote : To voice his views he used a wide range of characters, both common ‚Äì husbands wives, students, children, rickshaw pullers, villagers, beggars, whores, oppressed people, saints, revolutionaries; and uncommon ‚Äì God, ghosts, monsters, hospital beds. Some of his favourite themes were ‚Äì conflicts between emotion and reason, Hindu religion ‚Äì its rules, rituals and laws, caste system, struggles for survival and oppression of women in the Indian society. =Short stories= Palvannam Pillai ‚Äì Shortstory Pudumaipithan is primarily known for his short stories. Of the 108 stories that have been identified as works of Pudumaipithan, only 48 had been published in book form during his lifetime. Most of his works were published in magazines like Manikodi, Kalaimagal, Jothi, Sudantira Chanku, Oozhiyan, Thamizh Mani, Dina mani, Dina Sari and Nandan. The rest have been published posthumously in various anthologies, the latest one being in 2000. He belonged to the Manikodi movement (named for the magazine) which flourished in 1930s. Ku. Paa Rajakoopaalan, B. S. Ramaiya and Va. Ramasamy were his contemporaries in the Manikodi movement. =Translations= He was also a prolific translator of literary works from other languages into Tamil. He translated around 50 short stories, including the works of Moli√®re, Kay Boyle, Maxim Gorky, Sinclair Lewis, Ernst Toller, William Shakespeare, E. M. Delafield, William Saroyan, E. V. Lucas, Moshe Smilansky, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bret Harte, John Galsworthy, Aleksandr Kuprin, Anton Chekhov, Franz Kafka, Ilya Ehrenburg, Guy de Maupassant, Valery Bryusov, Anatole France, Leonid Andreyev, Henrik Ibsen, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Murray Gilchrist, Frances Bellerby, Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson, Leonard Strong, Jack London, Peter Egge, Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov, Thomas Wolfe and James Hanley. He had strong views on doing translations and adaptations. He equated adaptations to literary theft and held the view that translation was the proper way to bring literary works of other languages to Tamil. In 1937, he was involved in a literary feud with Kalki Krishnamurthy on the issue of translations vs adaptations =Poems= Pudumaipithan wrote about fifteen poems in total. His first published poem was Thiru Angila arasanga thondaradipodi azhwar vaibhavam, which appeared in 1934. Most of his poems were written as letters to his friend T. M. Chidambara Ragunathan in the form of Venpas. The fifteen poems were published posthumously in 1954. Like his short stories, his poems are full of wit and satire. The most famous of his poems is the abusive limerick Moonavarunasalamae written in review of a book on Tamil prose, which failed to mention the Manikodi movement. =Political books= Pudumaipithan's political orientation was socialist. Among his political essays and books, four are considered important ‚Äì Fascist Jatamuni (a biography of Benito Mussolini), Gapchip Durbar (a biography of Adolf Hitler), Stalinukku Theriyum and Adhikaram yarukku (both endorsing communism and policies of Joseph Stalin). All the four books contain scathing indictments of fascism and a general agreement with Stalinist policies. Writing style Ponnagaram ‚Äì Shortstory Pudhumaipithan was the first Tamil writer to successfully use a dialect of Tamil other than that of Chennai or Tanjore. Most of his characters spoke the Tirunelveli dialect. His stories were set either in Madras or in Tirunelveli, the two places where he spent considerable portions of his life. His writing style had a mixture of colloquial and classical words. Gentle satire even while handling complicated and serious situations was his hallmark. He used harsh language while arguing with his literary opponents like Kalki KrishnamoorthyA Foreword to Pudhumaipithan katturaigal by M.A. Nuhman ‚Äì Part 2 (in Tamil)Ilakkiyathil Sandai, An essay on literary feuds by Sa. Kandasamy (in Tamil) and wrote insulting limericks in his book reviews. Plagiarism and other criticisms Pudumaippithan has been accused by some of his contemporaries and later critics of having plagiarized from the works of Maupassant.A.R. Venkatachalapathy, Foreword to Annai itta thee (in Tamil) Chief among the accusers were his contemporaries Pe. Ko. Sundararajan (Chitty) and So. SivapathasundaramP.K. Sundararajan obituary, Kalachuvadu Magazine (in Tamil) and literary critic Kaarai Krishnamoorthy. Pudumaipitthan himself published the short story \\"Tamil Paditha Pondaati\\" (The wife who knew Tamil) with the foreword that it was based on Maupassant's work. Pudumaipithan's biographer T.M. Chidambara Ragunathan has identified the stories samadhi, Nondi, Bayam, Kolaikaran kai, Nalla velaikaran and Andha muttal venu as adaptations of Maupassant's works and the story Pithukuli as the adaptation of a Robert Browning poem. A few more stories like Doctor sampath, Naane kondren, Yaar kurravali and Thekkangandrugal have also been tentatively identified as possible adaptations. His defenders (including Ragunathan and historian A R Venkatachalapathy) have argued that those were adaptations and not plagiarizations. Pudumaipithan did not publish the short stories which have been identified (except Tamil Paditha Pondaati) as adaptations when he was alive. They were published posthumously only after 1953. Thus, the defenders infer he would have acknowledged them as adaptations if he had published them himself (as he did in the case of Tamil Paditha Pondaati). Further they contend Pudhumaipithan did not know French and during his lifetime the other Maupassant stories he has been accused of plagiarizing had not been translated into English. In their view, Pudumaipithan has had to suffer the accusation of plagiarism due to the callousness of his posthumous publishers . All of Pudhumaipithan's adaptations were written before 1937, when he became involved in a literary feud with Kalki Krishnamurthy about adapting works from other languages. During the feud he wrote biting essays equating adaptations with literary theft.Review of Pudhumaipithan Mozhipeyarppukal, Kalachuvadu Magazine (in Tamil) He has been criticized for just raising uncomfortable issues and not proposing any solutions for them. He had responded by pointing out that his job was only raising the issue and leaving the reader to figure out the solution. There have also been minor criticisms regarding his writing style like his digressing from the plot due to elaborate descriptions of environment and characters. Recently, Tamil critic A. Marx has criticised Pudumaipithan's portrayal of Dalits, Christians, Maravars and meat eaters as derogatory. Pseudonyms Pudhumaipithan wrote under different pseudonyms, but the name \\"Pudhumaipithan\\" was the one that became famous. He himself preferred the name as he felt that this name was partially responsible for the appeal of his stories. Some of his other pseudonyms were So.Vi, Rasamattam, Mathru, Koothan, Nandhan, Oozhiyan, Kabhali, Sukraachari and Iraval visirimadippu. For publishing poems he used the pseudonym Velur Ve. Kandasamy Pillai. Due to the accusation of plagiarism his pseudonyms have been extensively researched. T.M. Chidambara Ragunathan in his pudhumaipithan biography Pudumaippithan kathaigal: sila vimarsanangalum vishamangalum, has advanced the theory that all the works published under the name of \\"Nandhan\\" are adaptive works rather than original ones.A.R.

It is located 6 kilometres south-east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area (LGA) of the City of Randwick, in the Eastern Suburbs region. Colloquially, Kensington is referred to as \\"Kenso\\", \\"Ensington\\" or \\"Enso\\". Kensington lies to the immediate south of Moore Park and west of Randwick Racecourse. The principal landmarks of the suburb are the main campus of the University of New South Wales, National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and the exclusive Australian Golf Club. Kensington is also a residential suburb close to the Sydney CBD. History = Indigenous inhabitants = Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by the Cadigal people, one of the salt-water clans of the Darug language group. The Cadigal people were known for their fishing skills and often travelled in canoes. The 1828 census showed some 50‚Äì60 clans of Cadigal people living by the Lachlan swamps of Kensington and surrounding areas. Swamps provided fruit, nectar, roots and tubers. Very few Aboriginals live in Kensington today.Turbet. P. (2001). The Aboriginies of the Sydney District before 1788. Roseville, N.S.W: Kangaroo Press. =European settlement= The suburb now known as Kensington was once called the \\"Lachlan Mills Estate\\", \\"Stannumville\\" and then \\"Epsom\\". It became Kensington in the late 1880s, starting life as an industrial suburb. Samuel Terry, the convict who became Australia's first millionaire, received a land grant in 1819. Daniel Cooper (1785‚Äì1853), also an ex-convict acquired land here in 1825 with his partner Solomon Levey, whom he later bought out. Cooper's nephew Daniel (1821‚Äì1902) planned to subdivide but in 1865 all developments was forbidden. Residential land was issued in the late 1880s and Kensington was to be the equivalent of London's distinguished suburb, Kensington. Kensington Racecourse opened in 1893 on the site of the current University of New South Wales. It did not compete with nearby Randwick Racecourse because it held midweek meetings, pony racing and related sports like polo. The course was also used to house troops and horses during the Boer War, World War I and World War II, as well as a migrant hostel during the late 1940s.https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/kensington.html The land was resumed in 1950 to construct Sydney's second university.Waugh, J.

Kensington is next to Randwick Racecourse and Centennial Park. Transport Anzac Parade is the main road through Kensington. Numerous buses frequently service Kensington, linking it with the city and surrounding suburbs. There are no train services since the 1976 review of the Eastern Suburbs Railway abandoned the planned extensions to Kingsford. On 13 December 2012, the NSW Government announced a commitment to build a $1.6 billion light rail from Circular Quay down George Street to Central Station, then across to Moore Park and down Anzac Parade. South of Moore Park the line splits into two branches ‚Äì one of which continues down Anzac Parade to the nine ways at Kingsford. Construction commenced in 2015 and the Kensington section of the line opened to the public 3 April 2020. Geography =Topography= Kensington is located in the geographic zone known as the Botany Lowlands. The sands beneath Kensington act as a large water reservoir. Originally, Kensington was quite rugged, consisting of hills, deep gullies and 768 acres (3.1 km¬≤) of swamps, crossed by the Lachlan Stream. Evidence of the swamps can be seen in the south-west corner of the Royal Randwick Racecourse and the ponds of Centennial Park. After long periods of heavy rain some parts of Kensington are prone to flooding. Today Kensington has been levelled with hills cut down and voids filled with the excess soil from the hills. =Parks, flora and fauna= Ibis in Kensington Park In the three square kilometres that cover Kensington, there are six parks.Randwick Council Website Banksia, Bottlebrush, Waratah, Wattles and Eucalypt are some of the approximately four hundred native plants found in Kensington. Randwick City Council has recorded approximately two hundred and fifty species of indigenous native vertebrates. Two hundred and six species of native birds have been identified since 1788. The largest park, Kensington Park, covers approximately 2.8 hectares and attracts a wide variety of birdlife, including galahs, crows, ibises and magpies.

Her body was never found. Her parents, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a dingo. Lindy Chamberlain was, however, tried for murder and spent more than three years in prison. She was released when a piece of Azaria's clothing was found near a dingo lair, and new inquests were opened. In 2012, 32 years after Azaria's death, the Chamberlains' version of events was officially supported by a coroner. An initial inquest held in Alice Springs supported the parents' claim and was highly critical of the police investigation. The findings of the inquest were broadcast live on television‚Äîa first in Australia. Subsequently, after a further investigation and a second inquest held in Darwin, Lindy Chamberlain was tried for murder, convicted on 29 October 1982 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Azaria's father, Michael Chamberlain, was convicted as an accessory after the fact and given a suspended sentence. The media focus for the trial was unusually intense and aroused accusations of sensationalism, while the trial itself was criticised for being unprofessional and biased. The Chamberlains made several unsuccessful appeals, including the final High Court appeal. After all legal options had been exhausted, the chance discovery in 1986 of a piece of Azaria's clothing in an area with numerous dingo lairs led to Lindy Chamberlain's release from prison. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain.. A third inquest was conducted in 1995, which resulted in an \\"open\\" finding. At a fourth inquest held on 12 June 2012, Coroner Elizabeth Morris delivered her findings that Azaria Chamberlain had been taken and killed by a dingo. After being released, Lindy Chamberlain was paid $1.3 million for false imprisonment and an amended death certificate was issued.. Numerous books have been written about the case, and there exist several pop culture references notably using some form of the phrase \\"A dingo ate my baby.\\" The story has been made into a TV movie, a feature film, Evil Angels (released outside Australia and New Zealand as A Cry in the Dark), a TV miniseries, a play by Brooke Pierce, a concept album by Australian band The Paradise Motel and an opera, Lindy, by Moya Henderson. Coroner's inquests The initial coronial inquest into the disappearance was opened in Alice Springs on 15 December 1980 before magistrate Denis Barritt. On 20 February 1981, in the first live telecast of Australian court proceedings, Barritt ruled that the likely cause was a dingo attack. In addition to this finding, Barritt also concluded that, subsequent to the attack, \\"the body of Azaria was taken from the possession of the dingo, and disposed of by an unknown method, by a person or persons, name unknown\\". The Northern Territory Police and prosecutors were dissatisfied with this finding. Investigations continued, leading to a second inquest in Darwin in September 1981. Based on ultraviolet photographs of Azaria's jumpsuit, James Cameron of the London Hospital Medical College alleged that \\"there was an incised wound around the neck of the jumpsuit‚Äîin other words, a cut throat\\" and that there was an imprint of the hand of a small adult on the jumpsuit, visible in the photographs. Following this and other findings, the Chamberlains were charged with Azaria's murder. In 1995, a third inquest was conducted which failed to determine a cause of death, resulting in an \\"open\\" finding. Case against Lindy Chamberlain The Crown alleged that Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria's throat in the front seat of the family car, hiding the baby's body in a large camera case. She then, according to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going to the tent and raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body. The key evidence supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, discovered about a week after the baby's disappearance about 4,000 m from the tent, bloodstained about the neck, as well as a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of foetal haemoglobin in stains on the front seat of the Chamberlains' 1977 Torana hatchback. Foetal haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine weeks old at the time of her disappearance. Lindy Chamberlain was questioned about the garments that Azaria was wearing. She claimed that Azaria was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but the jacket was not present when the garments were found. She was questioned about the fact that Azaria's singlet, which was inside the jumpsuit, was inside out. She insisted that she never put a singlet on her babies inside out and that she was most particular about this. The statement conflicted with the state of the garments when they were collected as evidence. The garments had been arranged by the investigating officer for a photograph. In her defence, eyewitness evidence was presented of dingoes having been seen in the area on the evening of 17 August 1980. All witnesses claimed to believe the Chamberlains' story. One witness, a nurse, also reported having heard a baby's cry after the time when the prosecution alleged Azaria had been murdered. Evidence was also presented that adult blood also passed the test used for foetal haemoglobin, and that other organic compounds can produce similar results on that particular test, including mucus from the nose and chocolate milkshakes, both of which had been present in the vehicle where Azaria was allegedly murdered. Engineer Les Harris, who had conducted dingo research for over a decade, said that, contrary to Cameron's findings, a dingo's carnassial teeth can shear through material as tough as motor vehicle seat belts. He also cited an example of a captive female dingo removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact. Evidence was also presented to the effect that a dingo was strong enough to carry a kangaroo and a report of the removal of a three-year-old girl by a dingo from the back seat of a tourist's motor vehicle at the camping area just weeks before, an event witnessed by the parents. The defence's case was rejected by the jury. Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of murder on 29 October 1982 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Michael Chamberlain was found guilty as an accessory after the fact and was given an 18-month suspended sentence. =Appeals= An unsuccessful appeal was made to the Federal Court in April 1983.. Subsequently, the High Court of Australia were asked to quash the convictions on the ground that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory. However, in February 1984 the court refused the appeal by majority. Release and acquittal ABC news report of Lindy Chamberlain's release. The final resolution of the case was triggered by a chance discovery. In early 1986, English tourist David Brett fell to his death from Uluru during an evening climb. Because of the vast size of the rock and the scrubby nature of the surrounding terrain, it was eight days before Brett's remains were discovered, lying below the bluff where he had lost his footing and in an area full of dingo lairs. As police searched the area, looking for missing bones that might have been carried off by dingoes, they discovered Azaria's missing matinee jacket. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory ordered Lindy Chamberlain's immediate release and the case was reopened. On 15 September 1988, the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously overturned all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain. The questionable nature of the forensic evidence in the Chamberlain trial, and the weight given to it, raised concerns about such procedures and about expert testimony in criminal cases. The prosecution had successfully argued that the pivotal haemoglobin tests indicated the presence of foetal haemoglobin in the Chamberlains' car and it was a significant factor in the original conviction. But it was later shown that these tests were highly unreliable and that similar tests, conducted on a \\"sound deadener\\" sprayed on during the manufacture of the car, had yielded virtually identical results.Royal Commission of Inquiry into Chamberlain Convictions, Report, Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers (1987), volume 15, paper 192. Two years after they were exonerated, the Chamberlains were awarded $1.3 million in compensation for wrongful imprisonment, a sum that covered less than one third of their legal expenses. The findings of the third coroner's inquest were released on 13 December 1995; the coroner found \\"the cause and manner of death as unknown.\\" In December 2011 the Northern Territory coroner, Elizabeth Morris, announced that a fourth inquest would be held in February 2012. On 12 June 2012 at a fourth coronial inquest into the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain, Morris ruled that a dingo was responsible for her death in 1980. Morris made the finding in the light of subsequent reports of dingo attacks on humans causing injury and death. She stated, \\"Azaria Chamberlain died at Ayers Rock, on 17 August 1980. The cause of her death was as a result of being attacked and taken by a dingo.\\" Morris offered her condolences to the parents and brothers of Azaria Chamberlain \\"on the death of [their] special and dearly loved daughter and sister\\" and stated that a death certificate with the cause of death had been registered. Media involvement and bias The Chamberlain trial was highly publicised. Given that most of the evidence presented in the case against Lindy Chamberlain was later rejected, the case is now used as an example of how media and bias can adversely affect a trial. Public and media opinion during the trial was polarised, with \\"fanciful rumours and sickening jokes\\" and many cartoons. In particular, antagonism was directed towards Lindy Chamberlain for reportedly not behaving like a \\"stereotypical\\" grieving mother. Much was made of the Chamberlains' Seventh-day Adventist religion, including false allegations that the church was actually a cult that killed infants as part of bizarre religious ceremonies, and that the family took a newborn baby to a remote desert location. One anonymous tip was received from a man, falsely claiming to be Azaria's doctor in Mount Isa, that the name \\"Azaria\\" meant \\"sacrifice in the wilderness\\" (it actually means \\"God helped\\"). Others claimed that Lindy Chamberlain was a witch. It was reported that Lindy Chamberlain dressed her baby in a black dress. This provoked negative opinion, despite the trends of the early 1980s, during which black and navy cotton girls' dresses were in fashion, often trimmed with brightly coloured ribbon, or printed with brightly coloured sprigs of flowers. Subsequent events Since the Chamberlain case, proven cases of attacks on humans by dingoes have been discussed in the public domain, in particular dingo attacks on Fraser Island (off the Queensland coast), the last refuge in Australia for isolated pure-bred wild dingoes. In the wake of these attacks, it emerged that there had been at least 400 documented dingo attacks on Fraser Island. Most were against children, but at least two were on adults. For example, in April 1998, a 13-month-old girl was attacked by a dingo and dragged for about one metre (3 ft) from a picnic blanket at the Waddy Point camping area. The child was dropped when her father intervened. In July 2004, Frank Cole, a Melbourne pensioner, claimed that he had shot a dingo in 1980 and found a baby in its mouth. After interviewing Cole on the matter, police decided not to reopen the case. He claimed to have the ribbons from the jacket which Azaria had been wearing when she disappeared as proof of his involvement. However, Lindy Chamberlain claimed that the jacket had no ribbons on it. Cole's credibility was further damaged when it was revealed he had made unsubstantiated claims about another case. In August 2005, a 25-year-old woman named Erin Horsburgh claimed that she was Azaria Chamberlain, but her claims were rejected by the authorities and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Media Watch programme, which stated that none of the reports linking Horsburgh to the Chamberlain case had any substance. Current status Michael Chamberlain died of leukaemia on 9 January 2017, aged 72. The National Museum of Australia has in its collection more than 250 items related to the disappearance of Azaria Chamberlain, which Lindy Chamberlain has helped document. Items include courtroom sketches by artists Jo Darbyshire and Veronica O'Leary, camping equipment, a piece of the dashboard from the Chamberlain family's car, outfits worn by Lindy Chamberlain, the number from her prison door, and the black dress worn by Azaria. The National Library of Australia has a small collection of items relating to Azaria, such as her birth records and her hospital identification bracelet, as well as a manuscript collection which includes around 20,000 documents including some of the Chamberlain family's correspondence and a large number of letters from the general public. Media and cultural impact =Movies and TV= The story has been the subject of several books, films and television shows, and other publications and accounts. John Bryson's book Evil Angels was published in 1985, and in 1988, Australian film director Fred Schepisi adapted the book into a feature film of the same name (released as A Cry in the Dark outside of Australia and New Zealand). It starred Meryl Streep as Lindy Chamberlain and Sam Neill as Michael Chamberlain. The film gave Streep her eighth Academy Award nomination and her first AFI award. In 2002, Lindy, an opera by Moya Henderson, was produced by Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House. The story was dramatised as a TV miniseries, Through My Eyes (2004), with Miranda Otto and Craig McLachlan as the Chamberlains. This miniseries was based on Lindy Chamberlain's book of the same name. The case is mentioned in the 2003 comedy film Kangaroo Jack. =Podcast= The death of Azaria Chamberlain and the story of the search, inquests, trial and eventual exoneration of the Chamberlains was documented in a commercial podcast, A Perfect Storm: The True Story of the Chamberlains.https://apple.co/2OG2ggGhttps://aca.st/bca6bb =Popular culture references= The incident was transmuted from tragedy to morbid comedy material for US TV programmes such as Seinfeld, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and The Simpsons, and \\"became deeply embedded in American pop culture\\" with phrases such as \\"A dingo's got my baby!\\" serving as \\"a punchline you probably remember hearing before you knew exactly what a dingo was.\\" The incident was referenced in the Simpsons episode, \\"Bart vs. Australia\\", where Bart receives a phone call from Ausart says, \\"Hey, I think I hear a dingo eating your baby\\". It also was referenced in the Rugrats film The Rugrats Movie when, after the children go missing, a news reporter briefly asks Didi if it was true that a dingo ate her baby. A reference is also made about the case in The Office (US), when Kevin Malone is making an Australian accent in Season 3 Episode 21 'Product Recall'. In the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the character Oz is a member of the band Dingoes Ate My Baby. In the 2008 musical Saved, the line \\"Did that dingo eat her baby? That's Australia!\\" appears in the song \\"Make It True\\". The tabletop role-playing game Kobolds Ate My Baby! takes its title from the quote.

History  The history of the relationship between Japan and England began in 1600 with the arrival of William Adams (Adams the Pilot, Miura Anjin) on the shores of Kyushu at Usuki in ≈åita Prefecture. During the Sakoku period (1641‚Äì1853), there were no formal relations between the two countries. The Dutch served as intermediaries. The treaty of 1854 began formal diplomatic ties, which improved to become a formal alliance 1902‚Äì1922. The British Dominions pressured Britain to end the alliance. Relations deteriorated rapidly in the 1930s, over the Japanese invasions of Manchuria and China, and the cutoff of oil supplies in 1941. Japan declared war in December 1941 and seized Hong Kong, British Borneo (with its oil), and Malaya. They sank much of the British fleet and forced the surrender of Singapore, with many prisoners. They reached the outskirts of India until being pushed back. Relations improved in the 1950s and, as memories of the wartime atrocities fade, have become warm. On 3 May 2011, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that Japan is \\"one of [Britain]'s closest partners in Asia\\".  Chronology of Japanese‚ÄìBritish relations  =Beginning= *1577.

Adams and Saris travelled to Suruga Province where they met with Tokugawa Ieyasu at his principal residence in September before moving on to Edo where they met Ieyasu's son Hidetada. During that meeting, Hidetada gave Saris two varnished suits of armour for King James I, today housed in the Tower of London.Notice at the Tower of London On their way back, they visited Tokugawa once more, who conferred trading privileges on the English through a Red Seal permit giving them \\"free licence to abide, buy, sell and barter\\" in Japan.The Red Seal permit was re-discovered in 1985 by Professor Hayashi Nozomu, in the Bodleian Library.

This differs from an affiant, as in the case of an affidavit the facts therein are sworn to before a notary public or other official, whereas a declaration is usually made by one person for the use of another. Uttering a statement or declaration which is proven to be false is a crime in many jurisdictions, though usually a separate offence from perjury. The word declarant, when discussing the hearsay rule and its exceptions, refers to the person who makes an out-of-court statement.

It is located on the former estate of the George Carroll Jenkins family. The estate's name was \\"Seven Oaks\\", a reference to huge old oak trees planted on the property. They were thought to mark a traditional Lenni Lenape burial ground. One of these seven oaks still survived on campus until August 2007, when it was deemed potentially hazardous and cut down. =Accreditation and expansion (1950s‚Äì1990s)= School logo until 2008Villa Julie was approved as a two-year college by the Maryland State Department of Education in 1954 and received its first Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accreditation in 1962. In 1967, the college established a Board of Trustees and became independent of the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur and the Roman Catholic Church. Villa Julie became coeducational in 1972, admitting its first male student that year. Bachelor's degree programs were added in 1984, starting with degrees in Computer Information Systems and Paralegal Studies. Traditionally a commuter college for local residents, by the early 1990s Villa Julie started attracting students interested in college housing. Without the proper zoning for such an addition to the Stevenson campus, the college leased off-campus apartments in Pikesville and later in the county seat of Towson, where resident students began living in 1993. Villa Julie was granted admission to the National Collegiate Athletic Association and its NCAA Division III in 1994. It started offering master's degrees in 1995. A major 1997 campus expansion more than doubled the amount of instructional space on campus, including expanded athletic facilities. =Continued growth= On October 28, 2000, Villa Julie College inaugurated its fourth president Kevin J. Manning Ph.D., who succeeded Carolyn Manuszak. Under Manning, enrollment continued to increase and the demand for college-owned student housing intensified. The college broke ground on a second campus in Owings Mills in August 2003, opening it a year later. The Owings Mills campus included several major residence complexes. In 2006 Rockland Center, a new student union and dining hall, was completed. The Caves Sports and Wellness Center also opened that same year. =Stevenson University (2007‚Äìpresent)= Dawson Center, Greenspring campus In late 2007, the school's leaders decided to make changes needed to attain university status. Meetings were held to help determine whether the name should be changed to Villa Julie University, or something different, given its broader reach. Other names considered were Great Oaks University, Tufton University, Greenspring University, Rockland University, Sagamore University, and Billiart University. On June 11, 2008, the university's Board of Trustees voted to name the school Stevenson University: it referred to the original location of Villa Julie College and Robert Stevenson, a prominent Baltimore grain merchant who married Deborah Owings, the granddaughter of the founder of Owings Mills. Today, Stevenson University is composed of seven schools. The Howard S. Brown School of Business and Leadership opened for the fall 2008 semester and houses the school's Accounting, Business Administration, Business Information Systems, Computer Information Systems, Marketing, and Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics programs. Formerly housed on the Greenspring campus, the School of Design moved to a new building on a property purchased from Shire Pharmaceuticals in 2013 to create what is now the Owings Mills North location of the Owings Mills campus. In September 2016, the Kevin J. Manning Academic Center opened and today houses the Beverly K. Fine School of the Sciences, the Sandra R. Berman School of Nursing and Health Professions, and additional facilities for the School of Design. Facilities in Garrison Hall on the Owings Mills campus serve as the headquarters for Stevenson University Online, the university's online school for working professionals seeking master's degrees or to complete a bachelor's degree. The School of Humanities and Social Sciences and School of Education remains on the Greenspring campus. Greenspring campus buildings On July 3, 2017, Stevenson University's sixth president, Elliot Hirshman, Ph.D., joined the university after serving as president of San Diego State University since 2011 and previously as provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. The university expanded its athletic facilities in 2010 with the opening of a gymnasium and the 3,500-seat Mustang Stadium on the Owings Mills Campus. In summer 2017, Stevenson University reached an agreement with the state of Maryland to acquire the former Rosewood Center property in Owings Mills. The 117-acre site is adjacent to Stevenson's existing Owings Mills campus and nearly doubles the total acreage of the university. The Rosewood project has included remediation and demolition of 20 buildings on the site in spring 2018. Grading of the site began in summer 2018. Academics =Undergraduate programs= Stevenson offers over 90 majors, minors, tracks, and concentrations. All degree programs have a core curriculum in the liberal arts and a career emphasis.https://www.stevenson.edu/academics/undergraduate- programs/ In 2018, the university introduced five professional minors‚ÄîApplied Management, Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development, Human Resources, Real Estate, and Software Design and Coding‚Äîdesigned to pair with students‚Äô majors to give them additional career options and a competitive edge in the job market.https://www.stevenson.edu/academics/programs/minors/professional- minors/index.html The school reported that 92 percent of graduates were employed or started graduate school within six months of graduation.https://www.stevenson.edu/about/ Traditional undergraduate students can also complete a master's degree program through the university's bachelor's to master's option, designed to allow completion of both degrees in five years. =Leadership, Service, and Honors Scholars programs= Stevenson offers Leadership, Service, and Honors Scholars programs for students who wish to engage in leadership education, extend their civic engagement with the community, or partake in rigorous academic opportunities.https://www.stevenson.edu/admissions- aid/scholarshttps://www.stevenson.edu/alumni- giving/ventures/2019/winter/ventures-winter-2018-2019/challenging-students-to- go-further =Online programs= Stevenson University Online, formerly the School of Graduate and Professional Studies, offers online master's, bachelor's, and certificate programs for working professionals. Admission is granted on a rolling basis, and courses are offered year-round in 8-week sessions. Areas of study include nursing and healthcare; forensics, cyber forensics, law, and criminal justice; business & technology management and business communications; community-based education and leadership; and STEM- focused teaching.https://www.stevenson.edu/online/academics/online-graduate- programs =Enrollment= Stevenson University enrolls approximately 3,600 undergraduate and graduate students in more than 40 bachelor's and master's degree programs.https://www.stevenson.edu/about Stevenson's total enrollment has more than doubled since 2001. =Residence life and activities= The freshman enrollment and housing enrollments rose dramatically between 2009‚Äì2010 and 2010‚Äì2011. In the fall semester 2010, there were over 900 freshman students, around 700 of whom were residents. In 2013, nearly 2,000 students lived in 13 residence halls on the Owings Mills campus. In February 2018, Stevenson opened a Student Activities Commons in Garrison Hall on the Owings Mills campus to serve as a student club and activities center. The Commons include club sports offices, three meeting rooms, a fitness center, and a console video gaming room. It also serves as the home for Stevenson's esports team, which has its own esports arena. In fall 2018, a reading room and the university's fourth fitness center were also opened in Garrison Hall. From community services and the arts to education and religion, there are more than 80 clubs and extracurricular activities for students. Mustang Activities and Programming (MAP) hosts over 40 student events a year, popular events include: Homecoming, Founders Day Talent Show, Rockland Blowout, and Food Truck Rally. =Athletics= The university's athletic facilities include the Caves Sports and Wellness Center (formerly the training facility of the Baltimore Colts), the Owings Mills gymnasium, and Mustang Stadium. Stevenson teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III. The Mustangs are a member of the Middle Atlantic Conference (MAC). Stevenson used to compete in the Capital Athletic Conference from 2007‚Äì08 to 2011‚Äì12. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track & field, volleyball and swimming. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track & field (indoor and outdoor), volleyball (indoor and beach), and swimming. Men's and women's ice hockey compete in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference. In 2013, the Stevenson Mustangs men's lacrosse team took home the 2013 Division III national championship, the first National Championship of any kind for the school. They advanced to the finals after defeating their rival Salisbury University. Overall, as of Fall 2018, Stevenson has won 39 conference championships.http://gomustangsports.com/landing/index alt= = Greek life = In Spring 2018, the university invited two national fraternities, Phi Mu Delta and Phi Beta Sigma, to colonize on campus. The university has three sororities, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Phi Mu and Phi Sigma Sigma. =Marching band= With the induction of the football team in 2011, the university added a marching band. The Stevenson University Marching 100 is a modern-style marching band that plays both contemporary and traditional marching band music. The band uses woodwind, brass, and percussion instruments along with synthesizers, guitars, and color guard. The band plays at football games, open houses, and other university events. It is directed by Mark Lortz. Arts and culture Since 2006, Stevenson University has sponsored the Baltimore Speakers Series, which takes place at the Joseph Meyerhoff Center in Baltimore City. Speakers have included former President Bill Clinton, Steve Wozniak, James Comey, Tom Brokaw, John Cleese, Laura Bush, Garrison Keilor, and Doris Kearns Goodwin.https://www.stevenson.edu/about/office-of-the- president/baltimore-speakers-series/ Through its Arts Alive! initiative, the university offers a year-round calendar of cultural programs, including art exhibitions, theatre productions, film screenings, musical performances, and guest speakers. Arts Alive is a way for students, faculty and staff, and members of the art community to showcase their work.https://www.stevenson.edu/about/arts-cultural-programs Notable alumni *Martha Scanlan Klima, former member of Maryland House of Delegates References External links * Universities and colleges in Baltimore County, Maryland Baltimore County, Maryland landmarks Educational institutions established in 1947 Former Catholic universities and colleges in the United States Former women's universities and colleges in Maryland 1947 establishments in Maryland Private universities and colleges in Maryland ","title":"Stevenson University"},{"id":"1214442","text":"A rhapsode () or, in modern usage, rhapsodist, refers to a classical Greek professional performer of epic poetry in the fifth and fourth centuries BC (and perhaps earlier). Rhapsodes notably performed the epics of Homer (Iliad and Odyssey) but also the wisdom and catalogue poetry of Hesiod and the satires of Archilochus and others. Plato's dialogue Ion, in which Socrates confronts a star player rhapsode, remains the most coherent source of information on these artists. Often, rhapsodes are depicted in Greek art, wearing their signature cloak and carrying a staff. This equipment is also characteristic of travellers in general, implying that rhapsodes were itinerant performers, moving from town to town. Rhapsodes originated in the Ionian district, which has been sometimes regarded as Homer's birthplace, and were also known as Homeridai, disciples of Homer, or \\"singers of stitched lays.\\" Etymology and usage The term rhapsode is derived from rhaps≈çidein (·ø•Œ±œà·ø≥Œ¥Œµ·øñŒΩ), meaning \\"to sew songs [together]\\".Ridderstr√∏m, H. (2006). Tekstsamling I: litteraturhistorie: Litteraturhistoriske tekstpraksiser. Oslo: H√∏gskolen i Oslo This word illustrates how the oral epic poet, or rhapsode, would build a repertoire of diverse myths, tales and jokes to include in the content of the epic poem. Thus it was possible, through experience and improvisatory skills, for him to shift the content of the epos according to the preferred taste of a specific location's audience. However, the outer framework of the epic would remain virtually the same in every \\"singing\\", thus securing the projection of underlying themes such as of morality or honour. The performance of epic poetry was called in classical Greek rhaps≈çidia (·ø•Œ±œà·ø≥Œ¥ŒØŒ±), and its performer rhaps≈çidos. The word does not occur in the early epics, which use the word aoidos (·ºÄŒøŒπŒ¥œåœÇ \\"singer\\") for performers in all genres including this one. It is unknown whether Hesiod and the poet(s) of the Iliad and Odyssey would have recognised and accepted the name of rhapsode; it has been argued by Walter Burkert, and is accepted by some recent scholars, that rhaps≈çidos was by definition a performer of a fixed, written text.E.g. ; . The word rhaps≈çidos was in use as early as Pindar (522‚Äì443 BC), who implies two different explanations of it, \\"singer of stitched verse\\", and \\"singer with the staff\\". Of these the first is etymologically correct; the second was suggested by the fact, for which there is early evidence, that the singer was accustomed to hold a staff (·ø•Œ¨Œ≤Œ¥ŒøœÇ rhabdos) in his hand, perhaps, like the sceptre in the Homeric assembly, as a symbol of the right to a hearing or to \\"emphasize the rhythm or to give grandeur to their gestures\\".Bahn, Eugene, and Margaret L. Bahn. A History of Oral Interpretation. Minneapolis, MN: Burgess, 1979, p.7 The etymological meaning is interesting because it is an exact metaphor for what oral narrative poets do: they stitch together formulas, lines and type-scenes in the course of performance. There are indications in Pindar and other authors that oral epic was still a living and popular tradition in the early fifth century;, pp. 157‚Äì168. all the later evidence, however, is that rhapsodes worked from written texts, and in some cases were compelled by law to do so. Performance It is certain that rhapsodes performed competitively, contending for prizes at religious festivals, and that this practice was already well-established by the fifth century BC. The Iliad alludes to the myth of Thamyris, the Thracian singer, who boasted that he could defeat even the Muses in song. He competed with them, was defeated, and was punished for his presumption with the loss of his ability to sing.Iliad 2.594-600; see scholia on this passage and Apollodorus, Library 1.3.3. Historically, the practice is first evident in Hesiod's claim that he performed a song at the funeral games for Amphidamas in Euboea and won a prize.Hesiod, Works and Days 650-662: see Hesiod, Theogony ed. M. L. West (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966) pp. 43-46. Competitive singing is depicted vividly in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo and mentioned in the two Hymns to Aphrodite.Homeric Hymn to Apollo 165-173; Homeric Hymns 5 and 9. The latter of these may evidently be taken to belong to Salamis in Cyprus and the festival of the Cyprian Aphrodite, in the same way that the Hymn to Apollo belongs to Delos and the Delian gathering. An early historical mention of rhapsodes occurs in the Histories of Herodotus (c. 440 BC). He tells the story that at Sicyon the ruler Cleisthenes (600‚Äì560 BC) expelled the rhapsodes on account of the poems of Homer, because they promoted Argos and the Argives.Herodotus 5.67. This description applies very well to the Iliad, in which \\"Argives\\" is one of the alternate names for the Greek warriors; it may have suited the Thebaid still better, since Argos was named in the first line of that poem. The incident seems to show that poems performed by rhapsodes had political and propagandistic importance in the Peloponnese in the early sixth century BC. At Athens, by 330 BC, there was a law that rhapsodes should perform the Homeric poems at every Panathenaic festival; this law is appealed to as glory of Athens by the orator Lycurgus.Lycurgus, Against Leocrates 102. The Iliad was also recited at the festival of the Brauronia, at Brauron in Attica (Hesychius s.v. Brauronia). Perhaps therefore such a custom was exceptional, and we do not know when or by whom it was introduced, although the Platonic dialogue Hipparchus (not really by Plato, but probably of the fourth century BC) attributes it to Hipparchus, son of Peisistratos (Athens).Hipparchus 228b8. This, however, may be merely part of the historical romance of the Pisistratids: it is telling that Herodotus (7.6), who knew about Hipparchus' literary activities, knows nothing about this. The author of the Hipparchus makes (perhaps wilfully) all the mistakes about the family of Pisistratus which Thucydides notices in a well-known passage (6.54-59). The Hipparchus adds that the law required the rhapsodists to follow on from one another in order, \\"as they still do\\". This recurs in a different form in the much later statement of Diogenes La√´rtius (1.2.57) that Solon made a law that the poems should be recited \\"with prompting\\". Many Athenian laws were falsely attributed to early lawgivers, but it is at least clear that by the fourth century the Homeric poems were a compulsory part of the Panathenaea, and were to be recited in order. They are too long for a single rhapsode or for a single day's performance. Therefore, they had to be divided into parts, and each rhapsode had to take his assigned part (otherwise they would have chosen favourite or prize passages). Complementary evidence on oral performance of poetry in classical Greece comes in the form of references to a family, clan, or professional association of Homeridae (literally \\"children of Homer\\"). These certainly had an existence in the fifth and fourth centuries BC and certainly performed poems attributed to Homer. Pindar seems to count the Homeridae as rhapsodes;Pindar, Nemean Odes 2.1-5. other sources do not specifically confirm this categorisation.

The island is part of the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park. Its full name, rarely used, is Te Motutapu a Taikehu, \\"The sacred island of Taikehu\\", Taikehu having been a tohunga (tribal priest) of the Tainui iwi. 'Motutapu', meaning \\"sacred\\" or \\"sanctuary\\" island, is a term used for various islands in a number of Polynesian cultures.Vaka Moana - Voyages of the Ancestors - Howe, K.R. (Editor), Page 33 The island can be accessed via regular ferry services departing from Auckland City. Geography The island is now linked by an artificial causeway to the much younger volcanic island cone of Rangitoto. Prior to the emergence of the volcano, the island had been extensively occupied by MƒÅori for over 100 years. The eruption, some 700 years ago, destroyed their settlements, but there is circumstantial evidence that some of the residents may have escaped the destruction, presumably by waka (canoe). Of the many archaeological sites recorded, one, the Sunde Site (Puharakeke), shows human and dog footprints preserved in solidified ash. These were protected from erosion by a layer of ash from the next eruption.Alastair Jamieson (2004). Rangitoto, New Zealand Geographic 68, 18-37. (abridged version) Today the island lacks the forest cover of neighbouring Rangitoto Island and most areas are limited to grass and wet meadows. There are few large trees on the island but a reforestation project has been carried out by The Motutapu Restoration Trust. The project has brought back many indigenous flora to various sections of the island. In March 2013, two shallow earthquakes situated beneath Motutapu Island measuring 3.1 and 3.9 shook the Auckland area. Fears they could be a sign of a looming eruption at nearby Rangitoto Island were allayed by geologists, who said they were caused by fault lines, not volcanic activity. History Motutapu has an occupation history that encompasses virtually the full span of New Zealand settlement. It was one of the earliest places inhabited both by Polynesians, and later by Europeans in the Auckland region. The earliest evidence for occupation of Motutapu dates to before the eruption of Rangitoto in c. AD 1400.The dating of the Rangitoto eruption has been subject to review since it was originally published. Davidson‚Äôs review of the dates from the Sunde site in 1974 and Law‚Äôs in 1975 suggested a late 14th century date on the basis of two charcoal dates NZ1898 and NZ1899. However since that time the problems with in-built age in wood samples have become apparent. Nichol reviewed the dates in 1992, and included evidence from thermoluminescence (AD 1400‚Äì20) and paleomagnetic (1420) dating. These together with NZ1167 and NZ6954 which suggested AD 1400 was the earliest possible date, led him to conclude a date of c. AD 1400. This was also supported by McFadgen (1996), and the additional average dates from six obsidian hydration samples published in 2000 by Lowe et al. The eruption smothered Motutapu in ash and caused widespread deforestation, but also produced friable soils suitable for gardening. Archaeological deposits bracketing the ash suggest the eruption prompted a shift from broad-spectrum hunting of forest birds to intensive marine exploitation and horticulture.Davidson 1978; 1984:42 Numerous kumara pits were later found by archeologists. Following the eruption Motutapu is reported to have been visited by both the Arawa and Tainui canoes and was subsequently settled by the Tainui ancestors of the Ngai Tai. The Ngati Tai maintained rights of occupation from that time until its eventual sale with only minor incursions from other groups. The Ngati Huarere of Arawa descent claimed bird snaring rights over the kaka (native parrot) by right of conquest, and from the 18th century reciprocal fishing rights were negotiated with Ngati Paoa on Waiheke. In the 1820s many of the islands in the Hauraki Gulf, including Motutapu, were evacuated in response to the threat of Hongi Hika and the Ngapuhi armed with muskets. Many of the Hauraki tribes retreated south, and the Ngati Tai are said to have taken refuge at Maungatautari.Auckland Minute Book 1, Folio 26, Maori Land Court Records Occasional ventures were made back to former territories in the gulf, sometimes not without consequence, as with when a local fishing party was attacked by at Motutapu by Ngapuhi with several casualties.Fenton 1879:61‚Äì74 as cited in Coster and Spring-Rice 1984:8 From 1836 many of the evacuated territories were resettled, and the Ngati Tai remained on Motutapu until the northern part of the island was sold to Tom Maxwell in 1840. Maxwell had lived at Maraetai with the Ngati Tai and was married to Ngeungeu, the daughter of the principal chief, Tara Te Irirangi.Turton 1882:561 as cited in Coster and Spring-Rice 1984:10; From 1840 to 1845 the northern end was leased out to James Moncur. The southern end was purchased by Williamson and Crummer in 1845, but subsequently granted to politician Robert Graham in 1857, with the island increasingly becoming a trip destination ‚Äì Home Bay Wharf hosted such attractions as whale boat racing, greased pig chasing and hunting. The Reid brothers purchased the island in 1869‚Äì70 and retained ownership until 1943. A series of homesteads and outbuildings have been built at Home Bay, the first between 1840 and 1857, and the present Reid Homestead was built 1901‚Äì03. A homestead was built at Emu Bay c. 1869‚Äì70, occupied by James Reid and demolished in 1976. Work began on the Motutapu counter-bombardment battery in 1936.Pearson 1997:16-21 In May 1936 roads to battery had been formed, and the battery and observation post completed by June 1937, guns mounted by end of August 1938, and a temporary camp established at Administration Bay in 1937. War broke out in September 1939 and the military population on the island went from 10 to 200, requiring the construction of additional buildings at Administration Bay and at the observation posts. Plotting rooms were constructed in 1941‚Äì42, and searchlights installed at Billy Goat point. The US Navy intended to use Auckland as a staging point into the Pacific and this led to the construction of deepwater wharfing facilities, and the construction of 50 ammunition magazines between 1942 and 1943. The war ended in 1945, and within five years the entire complex had been abandoned. Landscape View from the south of Rangitoto Island and Motutapu Island Geologically, Motutapu comprises Waipapa series greywackes, cherts and argillites, overlaid with Waitemata tertiary sediments, and blanketed in Rangitoto ash. The cultural landscape of archaeological sites includes pre-Rangitoto eruption archaic campsites and adse making sites, 13 pƒÅ, numerous open settlements, midden deposits, storage pits, and agricultural areas. There are 372 recorded sites and it is likely that many more subsurface deposits remain unrecorded. Some of the sites will have been damaged or destroyed by farming and military activity. Sizes of recorded sites vary as might be expected over time with fluctuations in demographics and blurring boundaries of a mobile population. Settlement sites are spread across the whole island, with some apparent clustering on the western leeward side of the island around the mountain and causeway stream catchments, and early archaic settlements at open stream mouths and adjacent spurs. Davidson notes that a clustering around stream mouths and high number of distinct sites might be suggestive of a rotation garden system.Davidson 1978 PƒÅ sites are present on most of the easily defendable coastal headlands, although the relatively small amount of habitable land enclosed within defensive earthworks compared to area of occupied open settlements leads Davidson to conclude some of the open settlements may have been palisaded without earthwork defences, and that settlement on Motutapu was most likely a ‚Äúpeace-time horticultural based occupation, with periodic episodes of stress leading to fort construction and use‚Äù. Stone sources exploited for tool manufacture were largely the local greywacke found on Motutapu and nearby Motuihe, but included obsidians from Great Barrier and Northland, as well as Nelson argillites and basalts from Tahanga.Davidson 1981:111-2 Other locally sourced rock used in tool production included jaspers for hammerstones and sandstone grinders.Davidson 1982:31 There are three main areas associated with the 19th-century farming, and these include associated remnant plantings. Home Bay retains homestead, plantings, seawall, and graves. Emu Bay has the foundations of four separate groups of buildings, remnant plantings and isolated Norfolk pines on high points of the island. No archaeological remains have yet been located at Station Bay where the remaining farm settlement is known to have been located. The military structures on Motutapu comprise a largely intact World War II landscape including: the main 6-inch gun emplacement with three gun pits, underground magazines, shelters and stores; the battery observation post, engine and radar rooms; the Emu observation post and engine room for the anti-submarine defences; the ground-level plotting complex with miniature range, plotting and generator rooms; the underground plotting complex with command exchange, radio, plotting generator, battery and fuel rooms, as well as access tunnels and corridors; the search light emplacements and directing station; personnel camps at Administration Bay and the battery; the US Navy magazines north of the causeway and store at Home Bay, and numerous pillboxes to protect the battery from a commando assault. The landscape also includes a number of roads, wharves and quarries. Ecological restoration The natural vegetation of the island was almost totally gone by the middle of the 19th century, due to the volcanic eruption and subsequent settlement activities and pests introductions by both Maori and Europeans. =Pest eradication and translocation of native species= Possums and wallabies were eradicated from the island in the early 1990s. Following three aerial drops of brodifacoum poison baits on Motutapu and Rangitoto in winter 2009, as of January 2010, rodents, rabbits and stoats appeared to have been successfully eradicated. Most cats had been removed, though a few may remain, and hedgehogs were still plentiful. In August 2011 both Rangitoto and Motutapu were declared pest free. Since then a number of native New Zealand species have been translocated to Motutapu including takahƒì, saddleback and North Island brown kiwi. The work is overseen by the Motutapu Restoration Trust, and is to restore both the natural and the cultural heritage of the island, from restoration of the historic Reid homestead to replanting forests and restoring wetlands. = Regenerative agriculture = Since the mid-1990s, Motutapu Farms Limited have been adopting regenerative farming practices, also known as 'biological' in New Zealand (international research refers to the approach as; low-input, ecological, natural or alternative). Regenerative ‚ÄúPost-modern agriculture is not anti-science...it is the most modern agriculture because it builds carefully and creatively on advances in scientific knowledge particularly in the disciplines of biology, ecology and microbiology.‚Äù‚ÄîNorman Uphoff. (Professor of Government and International Agriculture; Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development; Director of Graduate Studies, Field of International Development.) Regenerative farming systems are on the rise as producers respond to a range of social, environmental and environmental drivers. In a 2011 UN report, Olivier De Schutter reviewed 286 recent sustainable agriculture projects in 57 countries, covering 37 million hectares. In the report he states that the approach is more resilient to extreme climate- related events, while substantially reducing the use of oil and oil-based pesticides and fertilizers. The review also discovered that adopting soil health methods increased average food production by 150%. This reflects on the ground reports from New Zealand farmers.

Located in Fukuoka Prefecture on the island of Kyushu, it is dedicated to education and research in the fields of science and technology. It is often abbreviated to KIT and sometimes to Kyutech. The founder was Matsumoto Kenjiro, second son of Yasukawa Keiichiro, and the links with the Yaskawa Electric Corporation (founded in 1915) remain strong to this day. The centenary of the opening of the Tobata campus is being celebrated in 2009, with Founder's Day on May 28, 2009. One of its famous alumnus is \\"Mr. Tornado\\", the severe storms researcher Tetsuya \\"Ted\\" Fujita. He graduated in 1943 and was an associate professor until 1953 when he was invited to the University of Chicago. History KIT Tobata campus front gate (Seimon) with the flags out on a national holiday The university was granted government permission to be founded in 1907 as a private training school for engineers called Meiji Senmon Gakk≈ç (Meiji Vocational School), toward the end of the Meiji period. The first campus opened its doors in Tobata in 1909, and the centenary of the university is therefore being celebrated in 2009. KIT became a Japanese national university on May 31, 1949 and has, since April 1, 2004, been incorporated as a national university corporation under a new law that applies to all national universities. Despite the incorporation, which has led to increased financial independence and autonomy, KIT is still quite strictly controlled in many respects by the Japanese Ministry of Education (Monbukagakush≈ç, or Monkash≈ç). In 1995, the Satellite Venture Business Laboratory was opened at Tobata campus. This was the first school building of what is now called Kyushu Institute of Technology. When it was built the school was called Meiji College of Technology (Meiji Senmon Gakko). It was designed by Tatsuno Kingo and the school opened in 1909. The first school building of Meiji Senmon Gakko was made wholly of wood and designed by Tatsuno Kingo. There is also a 1/50th scale model of the building on display in the university archives on Tobata campus. Founding principles The first president of KIT, Yamakawa Kenjiro who studied at Yale University declared that the aim of the school was to produce \\"gentlemen well versed in technological skills\\" (gijutsu ni tann≈ç naru shikunshi). Nowadays the university aims to produce both ladies and gentlemen with these skills, and enjoys a high reputation with employers. Founder's day is May 28. It coincides deliberately with the Battle of Tsushima of May 27 and May 28, 1905, the decisive naval battle in the Russo-Japanese War. Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç once visited KIT, and his visit is commemorated in the school's archives, as is that of Okuma Shigenobu. Campuses KIT has three campuses. Two of these are in Kitakyushu and one is in Iizuka. All three are in Fukuoka Prefecture, Kyushu. =Tobata campus (Kitakyushu)= Faculty of Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering. This is the oldest campus, opened in 1909. It was designed by Tatsuno Kingo. It originally had three departments: Mining, Metallurgy, and Mechanical Engineering. =Iizuka campus= Faculty of Computer Science and Systems Engineering, Graduate School of Computer Science and Systems Engineering. This is the second campus, established in 1986. The first students were admitted in 1987. =Wakamatsu campus (Kitakyushu)= Graduate School of Life Science and Systems Engineering. This is the newest campus, established in April 2001. International partnerships KIT has partnership agreements with several overseas universities, including the Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (Malaysia), University of Surrey (UK), Old Dominion University (USA), and the University of Texas at El Paso (USA).

It is distinct from a production control room (PCR) in television studios where the activities such as switching from camera to camera are coordinated. It is also vastly different from the studio where the talent are located. A transmission control room (TCR) is usually smaller in size and is a scaled down version of centralcasting. Master control is the final point before a signal is transmitted over-the-air for terrestrial television or cablecast, satellite provider for broadcast, or sent on to a cable television operator. Television master control rooms include banks of video monitors, satellite receivers, videotape machines, video servers, transmission equipment, and, more recently, computer broadcast automation equipment for recording and playback of television programming. Master control is generally staffed with one or two master control operators around-the- clock, every day to ensure continuous operation. Master control operators are responsible for monitoring the quality and accuracy of the on-air product, ensuring the transmission meets government regulations, troubleshooting equipment malfunctions, and preparing programming for playout. Regulations include both technical ones (such as those against over-modulation and dead air), as well as content ones (such as indecency and station ID). Many television networks and radio networks or station groups have consolidated facilities and now operate multiple stations from one regional master control or centralcasting center. An example of this centralized broadcast programming system on a large scale is NBC's \\"hub-spoke project\\" that enables a single \\"hub\\" to have control of dozens of stations' automation systems and to monitor their air signals, thus reducing or eliminating some responsibilities of local employees at their owned-and-operated (O&O;) stations. Outside the United States, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) manages four radio networks, two broadcast television networks, and several more cable/satellite radio and television services out of just two master control points (English language services at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto and French language at Maison Radio-Canada in Montreal). Many other public and private broadcasters have taken a similar approach (although the CBC's operation is arguably more complicated than most, with local breakaways on radio and local advertisements on television).

Mass production of inexpensive newspapers became possible following the shift from hand-crafted to steam- powered printing.B. Kovarik. Revolutions in Communication: Media History from Gutenberg to the Digital Age. (The Continuum International Publishing Group, 2011, ), p. 48. Famous for costing one cent while other newspapers cost around six cents, penny press papers were revolutionary in making the news accessible to middle class citizens for a reasonable price.  History  As the East Coast's middle and working classes grew, so did their desire for news. Penny papers emerged as a cheap source of news with coverage of crime, tragedy, adventure, and gossip. The penny papers represented the crudest form of journalism because of the sensational gossip that was reported.Barbara Friedman. \\"The Penny Press: The Origins of the Modern News Media, 1833‚Äì1861. \\" Rev. of: title_of_work_reviewed_in_italics, clarifying_information. Journalism History 31.1 (2005): 56-56. Research Library Core, ProQuest. Web. 27 Oct. 2009. The penny press was most noted for its price - only one cent per paper - while other contemporary newspapers were priced around six cents per issue. The exceptionally low price popularized the newspaper in America, and extended the influence of the newspaper media to the poorer classes. The penny press made the news and journalism more important, and also caused newspapers to begin to pay more attention to the public they served. Editors realized that the information that interested the upper class did not necessarily interest the penny-paying public. These new newspaper readers enjoyed information about police and criminal cases. The main revenue for the penny press was advertising while other newspapers relied heavily on high priced subscriptions to finance their activities. The idea of a penny paper was not new in the 1830s. By 1826, many editors were experimenting with sports news, gossip, and a cheap press.Fellow, R. Anthony, America Media History. (California State University, Fullerton) Ed. Rebeckah Matthews and Megan Garvey. 2005. p. 85-109. Most newspapers in the early nineteenth century cost six cents and were distributed through subscriptions. On July 24, 1830, the first penny press newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's Boston Transcript. Unlike most later penny papers, Walter's Transcript maintained what was considered good taste, featuring coverage of literature and the theater. This paper sold for four dollars a year. The penny paper‚Äôs largest inspiration came from Charles Knight‚Äôs The Penny Magazine (1832‚Äì1845). The main purpose of this magazine was to educate and improve England‚Äôs poor, but it was also very popular with Americans. It became a very successful magazine as it attained a circulation of more than 20,000 within a year. Frederic Hudson, one of the first to write about the history of American journalism, believed the rise of the penny press to be a key factor in the development of the modern newspaper. Hudson considered newspapers to be dull during the 1840s. Copying the idea of the northern newpapers, in 1837, Francis Lumsden and George Wilkins Kendall established The Picayune in New Orleans. The paper's initial price was one picayune, a Spanish coin equivalent to 6¬º¬¢ (half a bit, or one-sixteenth of a dollar).[1] Under Eliza Jane Nicholson, who inherited the struggling paper when her husband died in 1876, the Picayune introduced innovations such as society reporting (known as the \\"Society Bee\\" columns), children's pages, and the first women's advice column, which was written by Dorothy Dix. Between 1880 and 1890, the paper more than tripled its circulation.[2] Benjamin H. Day, founder of the first penny press in the USA Benjamin Day took the lead in profoundly transforming the daily newspaper. The newspaper went from narrowly focusing on the wealthy, with sparse distribution, to a broad-based news medium. These changes were seen mostly in New York City, Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and other East Coast cities.Donald K Brazeal. \\"Precursor to Modern Media Hype: The 1830s Penny Press\\". The Journal of American Culture 28.4 (2005): 405-414. Research Library Core, ProQuest. Web. 27 Oct. 2009. Day introduced The Sun, which appealed to a wide audience, using a simpler, more direct style, vivid language, and human interest stories.Bird, S. Elizabeth. For Enquiring Minds: A Cultural Study of Supermarket Tabloids. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1992: 12-17. Day was a New Englander who worked for the Springfield, Massachusetts paper, the Republican. He came to New York to be a compositor, but in the depression of 1833 he started The Sun out of desperation. Day reasoned that a penny paper would be popular in hard times as many could not afford a six-cent paper. He also believed that a substantial, untapped market existed in the immigrant community. His paper was an instant success. Its motto, printed at the top of every page, was \\"The object of this paper is to lay before the public, at a price within the means of every one, all the news of the day, and at the same time offer an advantageous medium for advertisements.\\"Jennifer Vance. \\"The Penny Press.\\" Retrieved from http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/spring04/vance/pennypress.html Day made advances in written news by introducing a new meaning of sensationalism, which was defined as 'reliance on human-interest stories'. He placed emphasis on the common person as he or she was reflected in the political, educational, and social life of the day. Day also introduced a new way of selling papers by putting into practice the London Plan. This plan included newsboys hawking their newspapers on the streets. The success of the penny papers was not automatic; selling the new concept of the newspaper to this new audience involved some persuasion. Consumers did not want to buy a new newspaper every day, and it was a challenge to convince them of the benefits of doing so. Most newspapers at the time did not have any sort of timeliness, so buying a newspaper daily seemed pointless to readers. But, eventually people became interested in reading the latest news which the penny papers strived to provide. The Sun, Benjamin Day's paper James Gordon Bennett's 1835 founding of the New York Herald added another dimension to penny press newspapers, now common in journalistic practice. Whereas newspapers had generally relied on documents as sources, Bennett introduced the practices of observation and interviewing to provide stories with more vivid details.Francke, Warren T. \\"Sensationalism and the Development of Reporting in the Nineteenth Century: The Broom Sweeps Sensory Details.\\" Paper presented at Conference on Sensationalism and the Media (Ann Arbor, Mich.), 1986. Bennett is known for redefining the concept of news, reorganizing the news business and introducing newspaper competition. Bennett‚Äôs New York Herald was financially independent of politicians or political organizations and clubs thanks to a large number of advertisers. Bennett reported mainly local news and instances of corruption, and strove for accuracy. He realized that ‚Äúthere was more journalistic money to be made in recording gossip that interested bar-rooms, work-shops, race courses, and tenement houses, than in consulting the tastes of drawing rooms and libraries.‚Äù He is also known for writing a ‚Äúmoney page‚Äù, which was included in the Herald, and also for his coverage of women in the news. His innovations sparked imitation as he spared nothing to get the news first. Horace Greeley, publisher of 1841's The New York Tribune, also had an extremely successful penny paper. He was involved with the first penny paper in America, Boston‚Äôs Morning Post, which was a failure. Instead of sensational stories, Greeley relied on rationalism in the Tribune. His editorial pages were the heart of his paper and the reason for its large influence. Greeley is also known for using his newspaper as a platform to promote the Whig and the later Republican Parties. Quite possibly the most famous penny press paper was started in 1851 by two men: George Jones (publisher) and Henry Raymond. This paper was originally named The New York Daily Times, but was later changed to The New York Times in 1857.http://www.nytco.com/who-we-are/culture/our-history/ Originally sold at one cent per paper, it became famous for incorporating journalistic standards that are common today, as well as having very high quality reporting and writing. The first issue of the New York Daily Times addressed the various speculations about its purpose and positions that preceded its release. It stated: This independent stance on public issues is a trait that future newspapers adopted, and this made it a good paper to read because people could debate over its content without feeling that one side was always given an advantage.  Political factors  Political and demographic changes were also significant. Much of the success of the newspaper in the early United States owed itself to the attitude of the Founding Fathers toward the press. Many of them saw a free press as one of the most essential elements in maintaining the liberty and social equality of citizens. Thomas Jefferson said he considered a free press as even more important than the government itself: \\"Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate any moment to prefer the latter.\\" It was because of his attitude that freedom of the press gained mention in the First Amendment to the Constitution, and though early politicians, including Jefferson, occasionally made attempts to rein in the press, newspapers flourished in the new nation However, the penny press was originally apolitical both in content and in attitude. As Michael Schudson describes in Discovering the News, the Sun once replaced their congressional news section with this statement: \\"The proceedings of Congress thus far, would not interest our readers.\\" The major social-political changes brought on by the development of the penny press were themselves helped by the penny press' focus on working-class people and their interests. Thus an apolitical attitude was, ironically, a political factor influencing the advancement of the penny press. The founders of the penny press popularized both low prices for newspapers and newspaper economics based on sales instead of political party backing. Benjamin Day created The Sun without any political party backing. This was rare because this was an era where political parties sponsored newspapers. On the other hand, Horace Greeley used his newspaper, the New-York Tribune, as a platform for Whig politics. Journalists In the early 1800s, newspapers were largely for the elite and took two forms ‚Äì mercantile sheets that were intended for the business community and contained ship schedules, wholesale product prices, advertisements and some stale foreign news, and political newspapers that were controlled by political parties or their editors as a means of sharing their views with elite stakeholders. Journalists reported the party line and editorialized in favor of party positions.Thompson, S. (2004) The Penny Press; Northport, AL; Vision Press The emergence of the penny press greatly influenced communication technologies by covering news outside those of government interests. The first penny paper, the Sun, was founded in New York in September 1833. After that time, newspapers became nonpartisan since they were not supported by political parties.Mindich, D.T., (2000). Just the facts: How \\"objectivity\\" came to define American journalism. New York, NY: NYU Press. Penny papers hired reporters and correspondents to seek out and write the news, while at the same time, started to sound more journalistic than editorial. Reporters were assigned to beats and were involved in the conduct of local interaction.http://www.uiowa.edu/~c036088/eight.pdf The penny press contributed to changes in newspaper content and structure. New journalism practices resulted in the development of concepts such as news reporting, emphasizing the importance of timeliness, and appealing to wider audiences.Nerone, J.C. (1987) The Mythology of the Penny Press. Critical Studies in Mass Communication. 4:4, pp. 376-404 These newspapers, though not completely uninfluenced by political parties and their views, were self-funded and not party-funded. This allowed them to shift allegiance on political issues that the papers dealt with quite easily, which also aided in their success and acceptance by the general public. Since these newspapers were not politically funded, the core interests of the journalists themselves were obviously quite different from competing newspaper agencies that had heavy political influence. The largest portion of demand was from immigrants, traditional middle-class citizens, and nascent literate classes; journalists kept articles concise and engaging with real-life topics readers could relate to, and did so with less sophisticated vocabulary so readers would not require higher education to understand the articles. The penny press formula is the combination of sensational news with mass market appeal, large-scale industrial production, and economies of scale used in combination with neutrality and objectivity to create a paper that gets its point across without taking sides.Nerone, J (2008) Penny Press International Encyclopedia of Communication doi:10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x. Also, journalist- incorporated advertisements treated readers as consumers instead of another market for demand, in an effort to establish a relationship between paper and reader that was less about work and the economy and more about relaxation and reading for pleasure and relaxation. Some reporters used the electric telegraph to share information.The penny press newspapers became more widely read because journalists made the effort to keep their content understandable to less educated audiences. They also focused on investigating topics with more factual-based information rather than opinion-based articles, which gave the paper a less biased form of news than the elite newspapers, which were often published by those with special interests. News items and stories were also shorter than those found in elite papers. It was also believed that the working-class audiences would not have enough free time to read longer editorials, hence the shorter and more concise editorials.Nerone, J.C. (1987) The Mythology of the Penny Press. Critical Studies in Mass Communication. 4:4, pp. 394‚Äì396 Human interest stories were also popular with the penny press audiences. Such items took up more space compared to earlier, more expensive papers that used human interest stories more as filler content.Hughes, H. M. (1940) News and the human interest story. Chicago: University of Chicago Press The New York penny papers were particularly known for publishing stories about interesting personalities and covering different aspects of the human condition. To connect with the urban, mostly working-class readership, New York reporters wrote about ordinary people and their experiences. They also wrote about the stock market, entertainers, politics, sports, and weather, all of which became important news and are still considered absolute necessities in a newspaper, thanks to the penny press.Thompson, Susan (2005) Secrets of the Penny Press Newsletter of the History Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication 40 (1), 1-4 Retrieved from http://www.utc.edu/Outreach/AEJMC- HistoryDivision/clio/clioarchives/cliofall05.pdf Reporters strove to deliver news in a timely manner and sometimes relied on the electric telegraph to gather and share information.Musson, A. E. (1958) Newspaper Printing in the Industrial Revolution, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol 10(3), p. 412. Penny press journalists were the first people to report on crises and crime news, something that has become a staple in newspapers since. Continuing reports on the same story were introduced in penny press papers and were read by thousands of people on the same day. This, in combination with the speed of news delivery and thoroughness in the coverage of local news, forever changed the direction of American journalism. Julius Chambers, the first muckrakerThere were a number of different types of journalists during the time of the penny press, one of the more interesting types being the muckraker. A muckraker was any American journalist who, in the first decade of the 20th century, attempted to expose abuses in business and corruption in politics.muckrakers (n.d.) In infoplease Retrieved from http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0834319.html Muckrakers, due to their specialization, did not write numerous types of articles but mostly investigative journalism pieces for magazines. Most people consider Julius Chambers the original muckraker. In 1872, Chambers undertook a journalistic investigation of Bloomingdale Asylum to obtain information about the alleged abuse of inmates. Thanks to his efforts, twelve patients who were not mentally ill were released, the asylum was re-staffed, and lunacy laws were changed.F. Liang (2011, March 14). Muckraker: Julius Chambers. Retrieved from http://lian2967s11.blogspot.ca/2011/03/julius-chambers.html Muckrakers still conformed to a neutral standpoint, but used their neutrality to dig deeper into the stories they were researching, which is why they ended up with as much information as they did. Muckrakers created a groundwork of public concern and set a standard for journalistic impact on political decision- making that has not been matched since.

Because the swelling is subperiosteal, its boundaries are limited by the individual bones, in contrast to a caput succedaneum. Symptoms Swelling appears after 2-3 days after birth. If severe the child may develop jaundice, anemia or hypotension. In some cases it may be an indication of a linear skull fracture or be at risk of an infection leading to osteomyelitis or meningitis. The swelling of a cephalohematoma takes weeks to resolve as the blood clot is slowly absorbed from the periphery towards the centre. In time the swelling hardens (calcification) leaving a relatively softer centre so that it appears as a 'depressed fracture'. Cephalohematoma should be distinguished from another scalp bleeding called subgaleal hemorrhage (also called subaponeurotic hemorrhage), which is blood between the scalp and skull bone (above the periosteum) and is more extensive. It is more prone to complications, especially anemia and bruising. Causes The usual causes of a cephalohematoma are a prolonged second stage of labor or instrumental delivery, particularly forceps delivery. Ventouse application does not increase the incidence of cephalhematoma. Vitamin C deficiency has been reported to possibly be associated with development of cephalhematomas. Management Skull x-ray or CT scanning is used if neurological symptoms appear. These measurements are also used if concomitant depressed skull fracture is a possibility. Usual management is mainly observation. Phototherapy may be necessary if blood accumulation is significant leading to jaundice. Rarely, anaemia can develop needing blood transfusion. The presence of a bleeding disorder should be considered but is rare. Cephalohematomas typically resolve spontaneously within weeks or months of birth, however calcification can occur in 3-5% of cases. While aspiration to remove accumulated blood and prevent calcification has generally been recommended against due to risk of infection, modern surgical standards and antibiotics may make this concern unfounded, and needle aspiration can be considered a safe intervention for significantly-sized cephalohematomas that do not resolve spontaneously after one month.

Accessed 2008-06-07.) It extends south for from its mouth between the suburb of Saint Heliers and the long thin peninsula of Bucklands Beach, which reaches its end at Musick Point. The inlet extends past the suburbs of Glendowie, Wai o Taiki Bay, Point England, Glen Innes, Tamaki, Panmure, and Otahuhu to the west, and Bucklands Beach, Halfmoon Bay, Farm Cove, Sunnyhills and Pakuranga to the east. It has several smaller \\"tributary arms\\" which extend from it: the Pakuranga Creek and Otara Creek in the east, and the Otahuhu Creek and Panmure Basin in the west. The Otahuhu Creek forms the eastern shore of the narrowest point on the Auckland isthmus: here it is about 1.25 kilometres (0.75 mi) to the waters of the Manukau Harbour, an arm of the Tasman Sea. It was originally called Te Wai o Taiki, meaning \\"The Waters of Taiki\\". The name Taiki is a shortened form of Taikehu, the name of an ancestor of NgƒÅi Tai.  History  Portage Road is the location of one of the historical portage overland routes between the two coasts. Here the Maori would beach their waka (canoes) and drag them overland to the other coast, thus avoiding having to paddle around North Cape. A second portage was named Karetu and went between the extreme north-east corner of the Manukau harbour to a bay close to the site of the newest bridge across the Tamaki, about south of the Panmure basin. The portages made the area of immense strategic importance in both pre-European times and during the early years of European occupation. In 1865, the estuary was first crossed by a steel swing bridge, located at Panmure, to improve connection between Auckland and Howick.The location is to the left of the left hand (Panmure) bridge shown in the photo. The circular base swivel was only removed in the 1980s from the southern shore. Stones and steel had been imported from Australia,Panmure Bridge (from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand.

In the 1890s the mouth of the river was used as a safe anchorage for ships carrying explosives. One such ship, anchored in the mouth of the estuary, caught fire and exploded with loss of life. After this the explosives buoy was moved into a more open area east of Browns Island (Motukorea), where it is still located.New Zealand shipwrecks : over 200 years of disasters at sea.

Auckland Star. Vol. LVI, issue 241, 12 Oct 1925, p 10. (Papers Past)  Transport  Due to its extent north‚Äìsouth and its position between Auckland City and its eastern neighbour Manukau City, the river is a natural barrier to traffic, especially as only three bridges cross it, all heavily trafficked and increasingly incapable of taking the peak hour flows. The Eastern Busway is a project that is designed to resolve this bottle-neck as one of its goals. The Tamaki River also has a marina / ferry wharf at Half Moon Bay, from where commuter ferries depart for the Auckland CBD and car/passenger ferries for Waiheke Island. Many yachts are also moored in its relatively well protected interiors. The river channel is marked with large green buoys. Deep draught vessels should stay close to the buoys as the channel, although averaging deep is very narrow in many places. Near the large Point England sand spit there are numerous mudflats which are barely covered at high tide. The speed limit in the river is . Rocks at the western mouth of the river at St Heliers are marked by a distinctive barber's pole. Vessels of more than draught should not attempt the opening between Musick Point and Browns Island. The channel in this area is marked by port and starboard markers about apart. It is northwest of Musick Point. Large mussel beds extend out from Browns Island into the river.

Southern's research focused on black American musical styles, musicians, and composers; she also published on early music. Early life Eileen Jackson grew up around many musicians in her family; her father was a violinist; an uncle, a trumpetist; and her mother, a choir singer. According to music scholar Samuel A. Floyd, Jr., \\"In childhood, as she developed as a pianist, young Eileen was introduced to and became partial to the music of those she calls the 'piano composers,' including Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Claude Debussy. In addition, her piano teachers, mostly white, were concerned that she wouldn't know music by black composers and introduced her to R. Nathaniel Dett's In the Bottoms, among other such compositions.\\" Jackson attended public schools in her hometown, Minneapolis, Minnesota, in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and in Chicago, Illinois. She majored in commercial art at Lindblom High School in Chicago. During the same period, she won piano-performance and essay competitions, taught piano lessons, and directed musical activities at the Lincoln Community Center. She gave her first piano recital at the age of twelve and made her debut in Chicago Orchestra Hall at age eighteen, playing a Mozart concerto with the symphony orchestra of the Chicago Musical College. She attended and received degrees from the University of Chicago (B.A., 1940, and M. A., 1941). Her relationship with Cecil Smith, her master thesis advisor, encouraged her to further develop her interest in Negro folk music. In 1942, she married Joseph Southern, a professor of business administration. She continued her studies and became the first African American to receive a PhD in musicology from an American institution (New York University, 1961). At NYU, she studied with Gustave Reese, Curt Sachs, and Martin Bernstein. She also studied piano privately at Chicago Musical College, Juilliard, and Boston University. Career Throughout her career, Southern taught at various institutions across the United States. From 1941 to 1942, she was an instructor at Prairie View University in Texas. From 1943 to 1945 and 1949 to 1951, she was an assistant professor at Southern University in Louisiana. From 1954 to 1960, she worked as a teacher for the New York City Public School district. She returned to higher education from 1960 to 1968 as an assistant professor at Brooklyn College, CUNY, and then as an associate and full professor at York College, CUNY, from 1968 to 1975, where she established the music program. In 1974, she became a lecturer at Harvard University. Two years later, she became the first black woman to be appointed a tenured full professor at Harvard University, where she taught until 1987. While at Harvard, she served as the chair of the department of Afro-American Studies from 1975 to 1979. Her best-known book is the seminal history The Music of Black Americans (1971). Her other work is Biographical Dictionary of Afro- American and African Musicians (1982). She founded The Black Perspective in Music in 1973, with her husband, Prof. Joseph Southern. It was the first musicological journal on the study of black music, and she was its editor until it ceased publication in 1990. Through her academic work, she raised the profile of Frank Johnson, a black bandleader from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who rose to fame at the end of the eighteenth century, beginning of the nineteenth century. He led Frank Johnson's Colored Band, and by 1818, he had taken his band as far south as Richmond, Virginia, playing dances for white southerners. Johnson had played a command performance at Buckingham Palace, where he received a silver bugle in appreciation. Throughout her career, Southern worked with various professional societies. From 1974 to 1976, she served on the Board of Directors and then Editorial Board from 1976 to 1978 for the American Musicological Society. She was a member of the International Musicological Society, College Music Society, and Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. From 1980 to her retirement, she served on the Editorial Board for the Sonneck Society for American Music and as a member of the Board of Directors from 1986 to 1988. In 1987, she retired as a professor emeritus to live in St. Albans, New York. Awards Southern's professional achievements were much lauded in the academic and artistic communities. Southern received a National Humanities Medal in 2001 for having \\"helped transform the study and understanding of American music.\\" She also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society for American Music in 2000.

Thus, several places claim to host this hypothetical centre. thumbupright=1.4This map shows in red points some of the locations of claimants to the title of Centre of Europe: Dilove (Rakhiv, Ukraine), Krahule (or Kremnick√© Bane, Slovakia), Dresden and Kleinmaischeid (Germany), Toru≈Ñ and Suchowola (Poland), Bernotai, or Purnu≈°kƒós (Lithuania) The first official declaration of the Centre of Europe was made in 1775 by the Polish royal astronomer and cartographer Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski, who calculated it to be in the town of Suchowola near Bia≈Çystok in modern north-eastern Poland. The method used was that of calculating equal distances from the extreme points of Europe: the westernmost point in Portugal; the easternmost point in the Central Urals; the northernmost point in Norway; and the southernmost point in Greece (islands were not taken into consideration). There is a monument commemorating that definition in Suchowola .  Current claimants  Locations currently vying for the distinction of being the centre of Europe include: * the village of Kremnick√© Bane or the neighbouring village Krahule, near Kremnica, in central Slovakia * the small town of Rakhiv, or the village of Dilove near Rakhiv, in western Ukraine * the village of Girija, near Vilnius, in Lithuaniahttp://confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=14714 : \\"according to the research of the French National Geographic Institute, the one and only geographical central point of the continent is in Lithuania, a fact that even won recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records\\" * a point on the island of Saaremaa in Estonia * a point near Polotsk, or in Vitebsk, or near Babruysk, or near lake Sho in Belarus * a point near the town of T√°llya, in north-eastern Hungary Guinness World Records recognises Girija, as the official geographical midpoint of Europe, but that does not preclude other centres, depending on the methodology used in making the determination.  Extreme points of Europe   History of claims  = Poland = Monument in Suchowola, Poland The first official declaration of the Centre of Europe was made in 1775 by the Polish royal astronomer and cartographer Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski, who calculated it to be in the town of Suchowola near Bia≈Çystok in modern north-eastern Poland. The method used was that of calculating equal distances from the extreme points of Europe: the westernmost point in Portugal; the easternmost point in the Central Urals; the northernmost point in Norway; and the southernmost point in Greece (islands were not taken into consideration). There is a monument commemorating that definition in Suchowola . = Austria-Hungary =  Blaufusz, today in Slovakia  The marker stone in Kremnick√© Bane, Slovakia In about 1815 there was a declaration that the centre of Europe was located near the mining town of Kremnica, on a hill that forms the water division between the basins of the Baltic Sea and Black Sea, near St. John Baptist Church. The method used for calculating is unknown, but from the description given on the commemorative plaque located near the church , it seems that it has been the centre of the smallest circle circumscribed on Europe (yet the limits of Europe taken into consideration are not known). The title of the \\"Centre of Europe\\" is also claimed by the neighbouring village Krahule (ancient Blaufu√ü), which used to belong to the same parish, now a famous centre for winter sports, with a hotel and recreation centre called \\"Stred Eur√≥py\\" (\\"Centre of Europe\\").  Transcarpathia, today in Ukraine  Austrian-Hungarian marker in Ukraine In 1887, geographers from the Austro-Hungarian Empire set up a historical marker and a large stone in what is today a part of Ukraine, believed to mark the geographic centre of Europe. The interpretation of the worn Latin inscription on the monument is debated, with some claiming that the marker is merely one of a number of fixed triangulation points for surveying purposes established around the territory of the former empire. The external borders of Europe taken into account during the calculations are not known. According to the description, the methodology used for the calculation is that of the geometrical middle point of the extreme latitudes and longitudes of Europe, so the stone was located at . However, the actual location of the monument seems rather and not the coordinates to which they relate. This is near the village of Dilove located on the Tisza river, close to the Romanian border, in the county of Rakhiv in the Transcarpathian region. = Soviet measurements = Measurements done after World War II by Soviet scientists reconfirmed the Austria-Hungarian claim that Rakhiv and Dilove (in Russian: Rakhov and Dyelovoye) to be the geographical centre of Europe. The old marker in the small town was renewed, and a major campaign to convince everyone of its validity was undertaken.  Tillenberg/Dyle≈à, today in Czechia/Bavaria  Marker near Tillenberg Austrian geographers also marked the 939-metre-high Tillenberg (Dyle≈à) near the Bohemian city of Eger/Cheb with a copper plate as the centre of Europe. As the border to Germany/Bavaria runs 100 m west of the mountaintop, the German village of Neualbenreuth uses this for promotional purposes. Bayerischer Rundfunk journalists asked the Institut f√ºr Geographie of the University of Munich to verify the claims. The institute concluded that the centre lies further to the south, in Hildweinsreuth near Flossenb√ºrg. = Lithuania = Girija, Lithuania Travel time by car or ferry from the geographical center in Lithuania After a re-estimation of the boundaries of the continent of Europe in 1989, Jean-George Affholder, a scientist at the Institut G√©ographique National (French National Geographic Institute) determined that the geographic centre of Europe is located at . The method used for calculating this point was that of the centre of gravity of the geometrical figure of Europe. This point is located in Lithuania, near the village of Girija. A monument, composed by the sculptor Gediminas Jok≈´bonis and consisting of a column of white granite surmounted by a crown of stars, was erected at the location in 2004. An area of woods and fields surrounding the geographic centre point and including Lake Girija, Bernotai Hill, and an old burial ground, was set aside as a reserve in 1992. The State Tourism Department at the Ministry of Economy of Lithuania has classified the Geographic Centre monument and its reserve as a tourist attraction. 17 km away lies Europos Parkas, Open Air Museum of the Centre of Europe, a sculpture park containing the world's largest sculpture made of TV sets. It is the only Geographical Centre of Europe with recognition in the Guinness Book of World Records. = Hungary = upright=.8 It is claimed that a 1992 survey found that the geometric centre of Europe is in the village of T√°llya, Hungary . In 2000, a sculpture was erected in the village, with a table on it declaring the place the \\"Geometric Centre of Europe\\". = Belarus = Monument to the Geographical Centre of Europe in Polotsk, Belarus In 2000 Belarusian scientists Alexey Solomonov and Valery Anoshko published a report that stated the geographic centre of Europe was located near Lake Sho (; ) in Vitsebsk Voblast. The scientists used a special computer program that takes Europe in a single entity ‚Äì the White Sea and the Baltic Sea, Britain and Ireland were included in the program as continental zone objects. It is assumed that in the calculations to determine the center of Europe, one must take into account the inland waters of Europe and the Ural Mountains, the eastern border of Europe.  Russian confirmation  Scientists from the Russian Central Research Institute of Geodesy, Aerial Survey and Cartography () confirmed the calculations of Belarusian geodesists that the geographical centre of Europe is located in Polotsk .

Again, no author and no method of calculation have been disclosed. The local K√§rla Parish is seeking to verify the location and to turn it into a tourist location.  Geographic centre of the European Union  The French Institut G√©ographique National (IGN) has been calculating the changing location of what it estimates to be the geographical centre of the EU since at least 1987. Its calculations exclude such extra-European territories of the EU as French Polynesia. As the European Union (or formerly ‚Äì European Community) has grown in the last 50 years, the geographical centre has shifted with each expansion. = 1987‚Äì1995 = Church in Saint-Andr√©-le-Coq 12 members: In 1987 the centre of the European Community of the 12 members was declared to be in the middle of France, in the village of Saint-Andr√©-le-Coq (63310), d√©partement of Puy-de-D√¥me (63), r√©gion of Auvergne. = 1990‚Äì1995 = Saint-Cl√©ment 12 members after the reunification of Germany.

A small monument commemorating the latter discovery still exists in Saint Cl√©ment. = 1995‚Äì2004 = Memorial at Viroinval (15-member- EU) 15 members: Using the same techniques, the IGN has identified the geographic centre of the 15-member Union (1995‚Äì2004) to be in Viroinval, Belgium, at coordinates , and a monument there records that finding. = 2004‚Äì2007 = Memorial at Kleinmaischeid (25-member-EU) 25 members: The 25-member Union (2004‚Äì2007), had a centre calculated by the IGN to be situated at , in the village of Kleinmaischeid, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. = 2007‚Äì2013 = Memorial at Gelnhausen-Meerholz (27-member-EU) 27 members: On January 1, 2007, with the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the European Union, the geographic centre of the European Union changed to a wheat field outside of the German town Gelnhausen, in the state of Hesse, 115 km east of the previous marker, at . = 2013‚Äì2020 = Geographical centre of the 28-member European Union including Mayotte (from 10 May 2014) in Westerngrund, Bavaria 28 members: On July 1, 2013, with the accession of Croatia, the geographic centre entered North-West Bavaria in the place Westerngrund at the river Schulzengrundbach at . When the French overseas department Mayotte (Indian Ocean island group between Southeast African mainland and Madagascar) joined the EU on 10 May 2014 (as part of France), the geographic center shifted by 500 m to , still at Westerngrund, beside a path. It is 40 km east of Frankfurt, Germany, which is headquarters to the European Central Bank. = 2020-present = 27 members: On 31 January, 2020, with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, the geographical mid-point moved to Gadheim near W√ºrzburg. = Other calculations = The geographical midpoint of the European Union is not free from disputes, either. If some different extreme points of the European Union, like some Atlantic Ocean islands, are taken into consideration this point is calculated in different locations. = Eurozone = The original centre of the Eurozone is located in France.

It may be colloquially called devil's bush, Siberian ginseng, eleuthero, ciwujia, Devil's shrub, shigoka, touch-me-not, wild pepper, or kan jang. E. senticosus has a history of use in folklore and traditional Chinese medicine. Root extracts of E. senticosus are sold as a dietary supplement or cosmetic, usually under the name Siberian ginseng. Etymology The scientific name, Eleutherococcus (from Greek) means \\"free-berried,\\" and senticosus, (from Latin) means sentis (thorn-bush, briar), an adjective meaning \\"thorny\\" or \\"full of briers or thorns.\\" It is not the same plant as American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) or Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng). It has a diversity of common names across its range of distribution. Distribution The herb grows in mixed and coniferous mountain forests, forming low undergrowth or is found in groups in thickets and edges. Eleutherococcus senticosus is sometimes found in oak groves at the foot of cliffs, rarely in high forest riparian woodland. Its native habitat is East Asia, China, Japan, and Russia. E. senticosus is broadly tolerant of soils, growing in sandy, loamy, and heavy clay soils with acid, neutral, or alkaline chemistry and including soils of low nutritional value. It can tolerate sun or dappled shade and some degree of pollution. E. senticosus is a deciduous shrub growing to at a slow rate. It is hardy to zone 3. It flowers in July in most habitats. The flowers are hermaphroditic and are pollinated by insects. Extract and chemical constituents Roots of E. senticosus are cylindrical, up to in diameter, straight or branched, dark brown, and have a smooth surface with bark fixed closely to the xylem. The derived extract from the roots has been characterized for its major constituents, including lignans, sesamin (eleutheroside B4), syringaresinol, phenylpropanes, coumarins, beta-sitosterol and daucosterol. Berries from E. senticosus contain diverse polyphenols, including caffeic acid, vanillic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and benzoic acid, with significant content of calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Major constituents of essential oil from leaves of Eleutherococcus senticosus include Œ±-bisabolol (26%), Œ≤-caryophyllene (7%), germacrene D (7%), Œ≤-bisabolene (5%), and Œ±-humulene (4%). Traditional medicine and adverse effects Extracts from the root of Eleutherococcus senticosus are promoted in alternative and traditional medicine for providing a range of health effects, but such claims are not supported by medical evidence. The plant has been assessed in preliminary research for its potential use as an antimicrobial or antistress agent, but these studies were of poor quality and there is no scientific confirmation that such effects exist. People with high blood pressure, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, heart disease, mental illness, a compromised immune system, women during pregnancy and lactation, and people taking digoxin or hexobarbital may have adverse reactions to E. senticosus. High doses may cause irritability, confusion, insomnia, or anxiety.

Originally called \\"Notre Dame of Maryland Preparatory School and Collegiate Institute\\" since its founding in 1873, (today's equivalent of elementary, middle, and high schools) ‚Äî the College of Notre Dame of Maryland was raised to the level of a four-year college for undergraduates in 1895. The lower preparatory school (high school in modern terminology) moved from CND's North Charles Street location to its current campus further north in suburban Baltimore County at the county seat of Towson in 1960, and is now known as \\"Notre Dame Preparatory School (or \\"Notre Dame Prep\\" for short). In 1896, the Collegiate Institute became the first four-year Roman Catholic college for women in the United States. In 2011, the College of Notre Dame of Maryland attained university status with the addition of several graduate-level programs and changed its name to the \\"Notre Dame of Maryland University\\", by the approval of the state legislature, the General Assembly of Maryland, various regional accrediting agencies and the Roman Catholic Church. = Presidents = # Mother M.

NDMU is situated between the wealthy residential neighborhoods from the early 20th Century of Homeland and Guilford, just north of the cross-town, Cold Spring Lane, and adjacent to the Evergreen campus of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College) to the south (occupied since 1922). It borders to the south, the historic landmark Greek Revival styled mansion of the Garrett family. Adjacent to the Montrose House (1850) on the original property site purchased by the School Sisters of Notre Dame, one of the first buildings, \\"Gibbons Hall\\", was constructed in an \\"L-shaped\\" structure. It surmounted by its landmark white wooden tower, and opened in 1873 and became the landmark site symbolizing \\"Notre Dame of Maryland,\\" which offered instruction to girls and young women. Gibbons Hall was named for the then incumbent Archbishop of Baltimore and second American Cardinal of the Church, James Gibbons. The University's Marikle Chapel of the Annunciation was originally designed by notable architects Ephraim Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington. It was restored in 2002. Fourier Hall is an example of Art Moderne architecture. The renamed \\"Noyes Alumnae House\\", which was the former Montrose estate of a red brick Greek Revival style of architecture was built in 1850, on the southwest corner of the campus. Several buildings on the campus were designed by architect George Archer The University shares a library with the neighboring Loyola University Maryland. The Loyola/Notre Dame Library was built primarily in a valley on land primarily owned by Notre Dame of Maryland and located between the two Roman Catholic campuses, with a road access to the east to York Road (Maryland Route 45) and the Govans community. Some courses from the College of Adult Undergraduate Studies and College of Graduate Studies are offered at off-site locations, including: Anne Arundel Community College, College of Southern Maryland, Northeast Maryland Higher Education Center, Laurel College Center, and Southern Maryland Higher Education Center.

In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of \`Authorization: Basic \`, where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon \`:\`. It is specified in from 2015, which obsoletes from 1999.  Features  HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header.  Security  The BA mechanism provides no confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with Base64 in transit, but not encrypted or hashed in any way. Therefore, basic authentication is typically used in conjunction with HTTPS to provide confidentiality. Because the BA field has to be sent in the header of each HTTP request, the web browser needs to cache credentials for a reasonable period of time to avoid constantly prompting the user for their username and password. Caching policy differs between browsers. HTTP does not provide a method for a web server to instruct the client to \\"log out\\" the user. However, there are a number of methods to clear cached credentials in certain web browsers. One of them is redirecting the user to a URL on the same domain, using credentials that are intentionally incorrect. However, this behavior is inconsistent between various browsers and browser versions. Microsoft Internet Explorer offers a dedicated JavaScript method to clear cached credentials: In modern browsers, cached credentials for basic authentication are typically cleared when clearing browsing history. Most browsers allow users to specifically clear only credentials, though the option may be hard to find, and typically clears credentials for all visited sites.  Protocol  = Server side = When the server wants the user agent to authenticate itself towards the server, the server must respond appropriately to unauthenticated requests. To unauthenticated requests, the server should return a response whose header contains a HTTP 401 Unauthorized status and a WWW-Authenticate field. The WWW-Authenticate field for basic authentication is constructed as following: \` WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\\"User Visible Realm\\" \` The server may choose to include the charset parameter from : \` WWW- Authenticate: Basic realm=\\"User Visible Realm\\", charset=\\"UTF-8\\" \` This parameter indicates that the server expects the client to use UTF-8 for encoding username and password (see below). = Client side = When the user agent wants to send authentication credentials to the server, it may use the Authorization field. The Authorization field is constructed as follows: # The username and password are combined with a single colon (:). This means that the username itself cannot contain a colon. # The resulting string is encoded into an octet sequence. The character set to use for this encoding is by default unspecified, as long as it is compatible with US-ASCII, but the server may suggest use of UTF-8 by sending the charset parameter. # The resulting string is encoded using a variant of Base64. # The authorization method and a space (e.g. \\"Basic \\") is then prepended to the encoded string. For example, if the browser uses \`Aladdin\` as the username and \`OpenSesame\` as the password, then the field's value is the Base64 encoding of \`Aladdin:OpenSesame\`, or \`QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l\`. Then the \`Authorization\` header will appear as: \` Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l \` = URL encoding = A client may avoid a login prompt when accessing a basic access authentication by prepending \`username:password@\` to the hostname in the URL. For example, the following would access the page index.html at the web site www.example.com with the secure HTTPS protocol and provide the username Aladdin and the password OpenSesame credentials via basic authorization: https://Aladdin:OpenSesame@www.example.com/index.html This has been deprecated by : Use of the format \\"user:password\\" in the userinfo field is deprecated. Modern browsers therefore no longer support URL encoding of basic access credentials. This prevents passwords from being sent and seen prominently in plain text, and also eliminates (potentially deliberately) confusing URLs like http://www.google.com:search@example.com/ which would query the host example.com, not google.com.

Its capital was somewhere south of the Han River. It preceded the Samhan confederacies, each of which claimed to be successors of the Jin state.Lee Injae, Owen Miller, Park Jinhoon, Yi Hyun-Hae, „ÄàKorean History in Maps„Äâ, 2014, pp.18-20 Name \\"Jin\\" is the Revised Romanization of Korean , originally written in Korean Chinese characters (hanja). This character's Old Chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as Baxter-Sagart. and originally referred to the 5th earthly branch of the Chinese and Korean zodiacs, a division of the orbit of Jupiter identified with the dragon. This was associated with a bearing of 120¬∞ (between ESE and SE) but also with the two-hour period between 7 and 9 am, leading it to be associated with dawn and the direction east. A variant romanization is Chin. History It is not clear as to how well defined of an organized state Jin was. It seems likely that it was a federation of small states much like the subsequent Samhan. For the state to be able to contend with Wiman Joseon and send embassies to the court of Han Dynasty China, there was probably some level of stable central authority. Korean historian Ki-baek Lee (1984, p. 24) also suggests that the kingdom's attempt to open direct contacts \\"suggests a strong desire on the part of Chin [Jin] to enjoy the benefits of Chinese metal culture.\\" However, for the most part Wiman Joseon prevented direct contact between Jin and China.Book of Han, \\"ÂÇ≥Â≠êËá≥Â≠´Âè≥Ê∏† ‚Ä¶ ÁúûÁï™ Ëæ∞Âúã Ê¨≤‰∏äÊõ∏Ë¶ãÂ§©Â≠ê ÂèàÈõçÈñºÂºóÈÄö\\", vol.„ÄàÊúùÈÆÆ„Äâ King Jun of Gojoseon is reported to have fled to Jin after Wiman seized his throne and established Wiman Joseon. Some believe that Chinese mentions of Gaeguk or Gaemaguk (ËìãÈ¶¨Âúã, Kingdom of armored horses) refers to Jin. Goguryeo is said to have conquered \\"Gaemaguk\\" in 26 AD, but this may refer to a different tribe in northern Korea. Records are somewhat contradictory on Jin's demise: it either became the later Jinhan, or diverged into the Samhan as a whole. Archeological records of Jin have been found centered in territory that later became Mahan.  Language  Alexander Vovin suggests that Japonic languages were spoken in large parts of southern Korea and Jeju before they were replaced by proto-Koreanic speakers (possibly belonging to the Han-branch).Vovin, Alexander (2013). \\"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222‚Äì240. This replacement caused Yayoi migration, dated 1,000 BC ‚Äì 300 AD. Thus it is likely that Peninsular Japonic and Proto-Korean language coexisted in Jin. Archeology Archaeologically, Jin is commonly identified with the Korean bronze dagger culture, which succeeded the Liaoning bronze dagger culture in the late first millennium BCE. The most abundant finds from this culture have been in southwestern Korea's Chungcheong and Jeolla regions. This suggests that Jin was based in the same area, which roughly coincides with the fragmentary historical evidence. Artifacts of the culture also show some similarities to the Yayoi people of Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan.Kenneth B. Lee, „ÄàKorea and East Asia: The Story of a Phoenix„Äâ, Greenwood Publishing, 1997, pp.23-25 Legacy Jin was succeeded by the Samhan: Mahan, Jinhan and Byeonhan.

While this includes all species of birds, recent evidence supports the hypothesis that many, if not all non-avian dinosaur species also possessed feathers in some shape or form. It has been suggested that feathers had originally evolved for the purposes of thermal insulation, as remains their purpose in the down feathers of infant birds today, prior to their eventual modification in birds into structures that support flight. Since scientific research began on dinosaurs in the early 1800s, they were generally believed to be closely related to modern reptiles, such as lizards. The word \\"dinosaur\\" itself, coined in 1842 by paleontologist Richard Owen, comes from the Greek for \\"fearsome lizard\\". This view began to shift during the so-called dinosaur renaissance in scientific research in the late 1960s, and by the mid-1990s significant evidence had emerged that dinosaurs were much more closely related to birds, which descended directly from the theropod group of dinosaurs and are themselves a subgroup within the Dinosauria. Knowledge of the origin of feathers developed as new fossils were discovered throughout the 2000s and 2010s and as technology enabled scientists to study fossils more closely. Among non-avian dinosaurs, feathers or feather-like integument have been discovered in dozens of genera via direct and indirect fossil evidence. Although the vast majority of feather discoveries have been in coelurosaurian theropods, feather-like integument has also been discovered in at least three ornithischians, suggesting that feathers may have been present on the last common ancestor of the Ornithoscelida, a dinosaur group including both theropods and ornithischians. It is possible that feathers first developed in even earlier archosaurs, in light of the discovery of highly feather-like pycnofibers in pterosaurs. Crocodilians also possess beta keratin similar to those of birds, which suggests that they evolved from common ancestral genes. History of research =Early= The Berlin Archaeopteryx Shortly after the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley proposed that birds were descendants of dinosaurs. He compared the skeletal structure of Compsognathus, a small theropod dinosaur, and the 'first bird' Archaeopteryx lithographica (both of which were found in the Upper Jurassic Bavarian limestone of Solnhofen). He showed that, apart from its hands and feathers, Archaeopteryx was quite similar to Compsognathus. Thus Archaeopteryx represents a transitional fossil. In 1868 he published On the Animals which are most nearly intermediate between Birds and Reptiles, making the case.Foster, Michael; Lankester, E. Ray 1898‚Äì1903. The scientific memoirs of Thomas Henry Huxley. 4 vols and supplement. London: Macmillan. The first restoration of a feathered dinosaur was Thomas Henry Huxley's depiction in 1876 of a feathered Compsognathus to accompany a lecture on the evolution of birds he delivered in New York in which he speculated that the aforementioned dinosaur might have been in possession of feathers. The leading dinosaur expert of the time, Richard Owen, disagreed, claiming Archaeopteryx as the first bird outside dinosaur lineage. For the next century, claims that birds were dinosaur descendants faded, with more popular bird-ancestry hypotheses including 'crocodylomorph' and 'thecodont' ancestors, rather than dinosaurs or other archosaurs. ='Dinosaur renaissance'= In 1969, John Ostrom described Deinonychus antirrhopus, a theropod that he had discovered in Montana in 1964 and whose skeletal resemblance to birds seemed unmistakable. Ostrom became a leading proponent of the theory that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs. Further comparisons of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as cladistic analysis strengthened the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called maniraptors. Skeletal similarities include the neck, the pubis, the wrists (semi-lunate carpal), the 'arms' and pectoral girdle, the shoulder blade, the clavicle and the breast bone. In all, over a hundred distinct anatomical features are shared by birds and theropod dinosaurs. Other researchers drew on these shared features and other aspects of dinosaur biology and began to suggest that at least some theropod dinosaurs were feathered. At the same time, paleoartists began to create modern restorations of highly active dinosaurs. In 1969, Robert T. Bakker drew a running Deinonychus. His student Gregory S. Paul depicted non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs with feathers and protofeathers, starting in the late 1970s. In 1975, Eleanor Kish began to paint accurate images of dinosaurs, her Hypacrosaurus being the first one shown with its camouflage. Before the discovery of feathered dinosaur fossils, the evidence was limited to Huxley and Ostrom's comparative anatomy. Some mainstream ornithologists, including Smithsonian Institution curator Storrs L. Olson, disputed the links, specifically citing the lack of fossil evidence for feathered dinosaurs. By the 1990s, however, most paleontologists considered birds to be surviving dinosaurs and referred to 'non-avian dinosaurs' (all extinct), to distinguish them from birds (Avialae). =Fossil discoveries= The first known specimen of Archaeopteryx, on the basis of which the genus was named, was an isolated feather, although whether or not it belongs to Archaeopteryx has been controversial. One of the earliest discoveries of possible feather impressions by non-avian dinosaurs is an ichnofossil (Fulicopus lyellii) of the 195-199 million year old Portland Formation in the northeastern United States. Gierlinski (1996, 1997, 1998) and Kundr√°t (2004) have interpreted traces between two footprints in this fossil as feather impressions from the belly of a squatting dilophosaurid. Although some reviewers have raised questions about the naming and interpretation of this fossil, if correct, this early Jurassic fossil is the oldest known evidence of feathers, almost 30 million years older than the next-oldest-known evidence.Tetrapod Zoology @ScienceBlogs Sinosauropteryx fossil, the first fossil of a definitively non-avialan dinosaur with feathers After a century of hypotheses without conclusive evidence, well-preserved fossils of feathered dinosaurs were discovered during the 1990s, and more continue to be found. The fossils were preserved in a Lagerst√§tte‚Äîa sedimentary deposit exhibiting remarkable richness and completeness in its fossils‚Äîin Liaoning, China. The area had repeatedly been smothered in volcanic ash produced by eruptions in Inner Mongolia 124 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous epoch. The fine-grained ash preserved the living organisms that it buried in fine detail. The area was teeming with life, with millions of leaves, angiosperms (the oldest known), insects, fish, frogs, salamanders, mammals, turtles, and lizards discovered to date. The most important discoveries at Liaoning have been a host of feathered dinosaur fossils, with a steady stream of new finds filling in the picture of the dinosaur‚Äìbird connection and adding more to theories of the evolutionary development of feathers and flight. Turner et al. (2007) reported quill knobs from an ulna of Velociraptor mongoliensis, and these are strongly correlated with large and well-developed secondary feathers. Citipati osmolskae specimen, at the AMNH Behavioural evidence, in the form of an oviraptorosaur on its nest, showed another link with birds. Its forearms were folded, like those of a bird. Although no feathers were preserved, it is likely that these would have been present to insulate eggs and juveniles. Fossil of Microraptor gui includes impressions of feathered wings (see arrows) Not all of the Chinese fossil discoveries proved valid however. In 1999, a supposed fossil of an apparently feathered dinosaur named Archaeoraptor liaoningensis, found in Liaoning Province, northeastern China, turned out to be a forgery. Comparing the photograph of the specimen with another find, Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing came to the conclusion that it was composed of two portions of different fossil animals. His claim made National Geographic review their research and they too came to the same conclusion. The bottom portion of the \\"Archaeoraptor\\" composite came from a legitimate feathered dromaeosaurid now known as Microraptor, and the upper portion from a previously known primitive bird called Yanornis. In 2011, samples of amber were discovered to contain preserved feathers from 75 to 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous era, with evidence that they were from both dinosaurs and birds. Initial analysis suggests that some of the feathers were used for insulation, and not flight. More complex feathers were revealed to have variations in coloration similar to modern birds, while simpler protofeathers were predominantly dark. Only 11 specimens are currently known. The specimens are too rare to be broken open to study their melanosomes, but there are plans for using non-destructive high-resolution X-ray imaging. Melanosomes are pigment-containing cells that produce colouration in feathers; as differently-shaped melanosomes produce different colours, subsequent research on melanosomes preserved in feathered dinosaur specimens has led to reconstructions of the life appearance of several dinosaur species. These include Anchiornis, Sinosauropteryx, Microraptor, and Archaeopteryx. In 2016, the discovery was announced of a feathered dinosaur tail preserved in amber that is estimated to be 99 million years old. Lida Xing, a researcher from the China University of Geosciences in Beijing, found the specimen at an amber market in Myanmar. It is the first definitive discovery of dinosaur material in amber. Current knowledge =Non-avian dinosaur species preserved with evidence of feathers= Sinornithosaurus millenii, the first evidence of feathers in dromaeosaurids Cast of a Caudipteryx fossil with feather impressions and stomach content Sinornithosaurus millenii Jinfengopteryx elegans fossil Several non-avian dinosaurs are now known to have been feathered. Direct evidence of feathers exists for several species. In all examples, the evidence described consists of feather impressions, except those genera inferred to have had feathers based on skeletal or chemical evidence, such as the presence of quill knobs (the anchor points for wing feathers on the forelimb) or a pygostyle (the fused vertebrae at the tail tip which often supports large feathers). =Primitive feather types= Integumentary structures that gave rise to the feathers of birds are seen in the dorsal spines of reptiles and fish. A similar stage in their evolution to the complex coats of birds and mammals can be observed in living reptiles such as iguanas and Gonocephalus agamids. Feather structures are thought to have proceeded from simple hollow filaments through several stages of increasing complexity, ending with the large, deeply rooted feathers with strong pens (rachis), barbs and barbules that birds display today. According to Prum's (1999) proposed model, at stage I, the follicle originates with a cylindrical epidermal depression around the base of the feather papilla. The first feather resulted when undifferentiated tubular follicle collar developed out of the old keratinocytes being pushed out. At stage II, the inner, basilar layer of the follicle collar differentiated into longitudinal barb ridges with unbranched keratin filaments, while the thin peripheral layer of the collar became the deciduous sheath, forming a tuft of unbranched barbs with a basal calamus. Stage III consists of two developmental novelties, IIIa and IIIb, as either could have occurred first. Stage IIIa involves helical displacement of barb ridges arising within the collar. The barb ridges on the anterior midline of the follicle fuse together, forming the rachis. The creation of a posterior barb locus follows, giving an indeterminate number of barbs. This resulted in a feather with a symmetrical, primarily branched structure with a rachis and unbranched barbs. In stage IIIb, barbules paired within the peripheral barbule plates of the barb ridges, create branched barbs with rami and barbules. This resulting feather is one with a tuft of branched barbs without a rachis. At stage IV, differentiated distal and proximal barbules produce a closed, pennaceous vane (a contour feather). A closed vane develops when pennulae on the distal barbules form a hooked shape to attach to the simpler proximal barbules of the adjacent barb. Stage V developmental novelties gave rise to additional structural diversity in the closed pennaceous feather. Here, asymmetrical flight feathers, bipinnate plumulaceous feathers, filoplumes, powder down, and bristles evolved. Some evidence suggests that the original function of simple feathers was insulation. In particular, preserved patches of skin in large, derived, tyrannosauroids show scutes, while those in smaller, more primitive, forms show feathers. This may indicate that the larger forms had complex skins, with both scutes and filaments, or that tyrannosauroids may be like rhinos and elephants, having filaments at birth and then losing them as they developed to maturity. An adult Tyrannosaurus rex weighed about as much as an African elephant. If large tyrannosauroids were endotherms, they would have needed to radiate heat efficiently.Norell, M. Xu, X. (2005) \\"The Varieties of Tyrannosaurs\\" Natural History Magazine May 2005. However, due to the different structural properties of feathers compared to fur, as well as a larger surface area per cubic square meter, it is extremely unlikely even the largest theropods would suffer overheating issues from an extensive feather coat. There is an increasing body of evidence that supports the display hypothesis, which states that early feathers were colored and increased reproductive success. Coloration could have provided the original adaptation of feathers, implying that all later functions of feathers, such as thermoregulation and flight, were co-opted. This hypothesis has been supported by the discovery of pigmented feathers in multiple species. Supporting the display hypothesis is the fact that fossil feathers have been observed in a ground-dwelling herbivorous dinosaur clade, making it unlikely that feathers functioned as predatory tools or as a means of flight. Additionally, some specimens have iridescent feathers. Pigmented and iridescent feathers may have provided greater attractiveness to mates, providing enhanced reproductive success when compared to non-colored feathers. Current research shows that it is plausible that theropods would have had the visual acuity necessary to see the displays. In a study by Stevens (2006), the binocular field of view for Velociraptor has been estimated to be 55 to 60 degrees, which is about that of modern owls. Visual acuity for Tyrannosaurus has been predicted to be anywhere from about that of humans to 13 times that of humans. However, as both Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus have a rather extended evolutionary relationship with the more basal theropods, it is unclear how much of this visual acuity data can be extrapolated. The idea that precursors of feathers appeared before they were co-opted for insulation is already stated in Gould and Vrba, 1982. The original benefit might have been metabolic. Feathers are largely made of the keratin protein complex, which has disulfide bonds between amino acids that give it stability and elasticity. The metabolism of amino acids containing sulfur can be toxic; however, if the sulfur amino acids are not catabolized at the final products of urea or uric acid but used for the synthesis of keratin instead, the release of hydrogen sulfide is extremely reduced or avoided. For an organism whose metabolism works at high internal temperatures of 40 ¬∞C or greater, it can be extremely important to prevent the excess production of hydrogen sulfide. This hypothesis could be consistent with the need for high metabolic rate of theropod dinosaurs. It is not known with certainty at what point in archosaur phylogeny the earliest simple \\"protofeathers\\" arose, or whether they arose once or independently multiple times. Filamentous structures are clearly present in pterosaurs, and long, hollow quills have been reported in specimens of the ornithischian dinosaurs Psittacosaurus and Tianyulong. In 2009, Xu et al. noted that the hollow, unbranched, stiff integumentary structures found on a specimen of Beipiaosaurus were strikingly similar to the integumentary structures of Psittacosaurus and pterosaurs. They suggested that all of these structures may have been inherited from a common ancestor much earlier in the evolution of archosaurs, possibly in an ornithodire from the Middle Triassic or earlier. More recently, findings in Russia of the basal neornithischian Kulindadromeus report that although the lower leg and tail seemed to be scaled, \\"varied integumentary structures were found directly associated with skeletal elements, supporting the hypothesis that simple filamentous feathers, as well as compound feather-like structures comparable to those in theropods, were widespread amongst the whole dinosaur clade.\\" Display feathers are also known from dinosaurs that are very primitive members of the bird lineage, or Avialae. The most primitive example is Epidexipteryx, which had a short tail with extremely long, ribbon-like feathers. Oddly enough, the fossil does not preserve wing feathers, suggesting that Epidexipteryx was either secondarily flightless, or that display feathers evolved before flight feathers in the bird lineage. Plumaceous feathers are found in nearly all lineages of Theropoda common in the northern hemisphere, and pennaceous feathers are attested as far down the tree as the Ornithomimosauria. The fact that only adult Ornithomimus had wing-like structures suggests that pennaceous feathers evolved for mating displays. Phylogeny and the inference of feathers in other dinosaurs Cladogram showing distribution of feathers in Dinosauria, as of 2019. The groups marked with scales not necessarily lacked feathers, but simply have never been found with feather impressions. Fossil feather impressions are extremely rare and they require exceptional preservation conditions to form. Therefore, only a few non-avian feathered dinosaur genera have been identified. All fossil feather specimens have been found to show certain similarities. Due to these similarities and through developmental research, many scientists believe that feathers have only evolved once in dinosaurs. Feathers would then have been passed down to all later, more derived species, unless some lineages lost feathers secondarily. If a dinosaur falls at a point on an evolutionary tree within the known feather-bearing lineages, then its ancestors had feathers, and it is quite possible that it did as well. This technique, called phylogenetic bracketing, can also be used to infer the type of feathers a species may have had, since the developmental history of feathers is now reasonably well-known. All feathered species had filamentaceous or plumaceous (downy) feathers, with pennaceous feathers found among the more bird-like groups. The following cladogram is adapted from Godefroit et al., 2013. Phylogenetic bracketing can also be used to evidence the lack of feathered integument by inference. For example, the presence of scaly integument in a specific clade would be a strong indicator that members in the clade would share similar integument, as independent evolution of feathers multiple times is unlikely, regardless if fossil evidence is present for all genera within the clade. Grey denotes a clade that is not known to contain any feathered specimen at the time of writing, some of which have fossil evidence of scales. The presence or lack of feathered specimens in a given clade does not confirm that all members in a clade have the specified integument, unless corroborated with representative fossil evidence within clade members.

It has been suggested that this is the second oldest canal in England, completed in 1611 (Exeter was the first). However, as late as 1676 two tenants, John Cooper and John Landy, complained in the Manorial Court that the Lord of the Manor \\"by Cutting ye new River hath taken away and doth detain\\" parts of their copyholds, implying that in 1676 the construction was recent. It lies close to Titchfield Haven, concealed by a bridge with the remains of a sea-lock at the south end. A footpath follows the canal to Titchfield village. It was certainly used for flooding the water meadows, traces of which can still be clearly seen. Whether it was ever used as a navigation channel is still debated.

Titchfield has long been a centre for business, with the village once having a small port. There were also tanneries (some of the buildings still exist), a market, a fair, brewers, craftsmen, traders and other business people. It is recorded that Henry V before Agincourt and Charles I before his imprisonment at Carisbrooke rested in the town. A Market Hall was built in Titchfield Square by the 3rd Earl of Southampton in the early 17th century. This was moved behind the Queen's Head Public House in 1810. In 1801 Titchfield had a population of almost 3,000. In 1865 a gas company provided gaslight to the village and in 1894 Titchfield was given a parish council. In 1970, with the market hall in a derelict state, it was bought by the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The entire hall was dismantled and moved to Singleton where it now stands restored in the centre of a new (old) village. At the 2001 census, the population of the village was estimated at 7,000.

English longbowmen figure prominently in the foreground at right where they drive away the French crossbowmen. A ranged weapon is any weapon that can engage targets beyond hand-to-hand distance, i.e. at distances greater than the physical reach of the weapon itself. It is sometimes also called projectile weapon or missile weapon because it typically works by launching projectiles (\\"missiles\\"), though technically a directed-energy weapon (which does not involve projectiles) is also a ranged weapon. In contrast, a weapon intended to be used in hand-to-hand combat is called a melee weapon. Ranged weapons give the attacker an advantage, since the target is often getting hit from beyond immediate visual range, therefore making it more difficult for the defenders to react and hitting back effectively. It also puts distance between the attacker and the opponent, which is a safer combat option since the close physical contact during melee fights often puts the attacker within the immediate striking range of enemy counterattacks and thus at an equal risk of getting hurt or killed. The line between ranged and melee weapons is not entirely definite; for instance, spears, axes, knives and daggers can be used for both throwing and striking, depending on purpose and situation, and a ranged weapon can also be used as a melee weapon in close encounters, such as a rifle being used for melee with its buttstock and a fixed bayonet, a handgun used used as an improvised hammer and even an arrow being used for stabbing (as an improvised shiv) in desperate situations. Early ranged weapons often included specifically designed hand-thrown weapons such as javelins, slings and darts, as well as more complex elastic weapons such as slingshots and bows; and siege engines like stone throwers, catapults, ballistas and trebuchets. These ranged weapons were extremely effective in combat, especially when used en masse, as they gave the wielder opportunity to launch multiple rounds of attack before an enemy armed with melee weapons or shorter- ranged missile weapons could even get close enough to pose a threat. After the invention of gunpowder and the development of firearms, gun-type pneumatic ranged weapons became the dominant weapon of choice in armed conflicts, even in close combat. In modern warfare, ranged weaponry is also used both tactically and strategically in the form of long-range artilleries, rockets and guided missiles. The maximum effective range of a weapon is the greatest distance from which the weapon can be fired while still consistently inflicting casualties or damage.

It was extended greatly and printed religious literature in its basement in many languages for nearly 100 years. In the 1950s, when missionary work in China died, the building was given to the HK government which gave it to the University of Hong Kong as a student residential unit. It is smaller now than it used to be, but still houses 100 or so undergraduates. There was a chapel in the building: it now serves as the dining hall for the students. University Hall is much in demand as a location for movies, wedding photos, advertisements, and other purposes. Village Pok Fu Lam Village At the centre of Pok Fu Lam is an indigenous village, the Pok Fu Lam Village (), the only one of its kind remaining on Hong Kong Island. Often mistaken as a shanty town by the residents of the surrounding apartments, the conservation value of the village has been acknowledged by its inclusion on the 2014 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.Pokfulam Village World Monuments Fund =History= Lee Ling Fairy Tower Pok Fu Lam Village is a historic village, which has existed since the beginning of the 17th century. Local residents in the past have repeatedly asked the government to give indigenous inhabitants of Pok Fu Lam the same recognition as residents of the New Territories. These claims have been rejected by the government which also threatened demolition of the village. In the Kangxi period (late 17th century) of the Qing dynasty, approximately 2,000 people seeking asylum from turmoils in mainland China reached this village. The early villagers, mostly with the surnames of Chen, Huang, and Luo, were farmers. The \\"Xinan County Journal\\" of 1819 mentioned that Pok Fu Lam Village was one of three villages on Hong Kong Island (the other were at Stanley and Wong Chuk Hang). It was described as \\"built alongside the hill and the creek, its structures are quite elegant\\". After the Second World War, the massive refugee influx seeking asylum from mainland China reached Hong Kong, resulting in the village population increasing from 20-odd households to more than 100 households. The original vegetable gardens were replaced by houses. It was not until the 1980s, when the Hong Kong economy experienced rapid growth, that the village population began to decrease, but many villagers remain in the village today. =Fire Dragon Festival= The villagers have their own festivals: the annual Fire Dragon Dance, the oldest of its kind in Hong Kong, is held during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and is organised entirely by the villagers, who strive to preserve the unique festival for the generations to come. Ng Kong-kin, master craftsman of the 73.3 metre long dragon, has been making these creatures for more than four decades, and continues to volunteer his time building the enormous beast every year; his brother Ng Kong-nan, supervises the training of the dancers and preparation for the annual celebrations. All villagers participate in the burning of incense and each household is blessed by the dragons as they dance through the village, making the festival a fundamental part of the village life. Many other less well known festivals include Bou Chun Tin, which commemorates N√ºwa repairing the Wall of Heaven; Fa San Fuk, a ritual carried out on Lunar New Year's Eve for good fortune throughout the year; and Jip Nin Gang, when villagers calculate the best time in Chinese feng shui to welcome the new year, and prepare celebratory procedures for the particular moment. =Buildings= The forest village is divided into three parts: Middle is \\"Wai Chai\\", Northern portion is \\"the vegetable garden\\", the village tail is \\"Long Tzutu\\". There are few types of village house. Some are made of stone and hay with Chinese tiled pitched roof. Some Chinese tiled pitched roof had been replaced with galvanised steel roof. Some village houses are made of brick with concrete flate roof or galvanised steel roofs. In addition the village has characteristic towers, named Li Ling Divine Pagoda, is approximately 5 meters high. The existing pagoda was rebuilt in 1916. The first pagoda was built of stone as advised by the elder villagers. Housing estates Chi Fu Fa Yuen, next to Pok Fu Lam Village Pok Fu Lam is notable for its quiet, green living environment (by Hong Kong standard), attracting a significant number of expatriates, many of whom work at the nearby University of Hong Kong. Several private housing estates are located in Pok Fu Lam. * Chi Fu Fa Yuen () was developed in the mid-seventies by Hongkong Land. It comprises 20 towers of 28-storey high-rise buildings with a total of 4,258 residential units and 7 towers of 5-storey villa type low-rise buildings with 70 household units.Chan, Chi-kau, Johnnie Casire, \\"Community development and management of private sector housing estates in Hong Kong\\" , University of Hong Kong, August 1995 * Pokfulam Gardens * Baguio Villa Education * German Swiss International School maintains a campus in Pok Fu Lam.\\"Campuses.\\" German Swiss International School.

He also played for Ipswich Town, Everton and other clubs.David Johnson on Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database profile Everton Johnson signed for Liverpool rivals Everton as a youngster and after showing his ability in early matches, Liverpool manager Bill Shankly pestered Everton counterpart Harry Catterick to sell the young striker, but was rebuffed. Johnson made his Everton debut as a 19-year-old on 8 January 1971 in a 2‚Äì2 league draw with Burnley at Turf Moor. Later on in 1971 Johnson scored in a Merseyside derby game for Everton. Ipswich Town Johnson joined Bobby Robson's Ipswich Town in the November 1972 swapping for Ipswich's top goalscorer, Rod Belfitt and ¬£40,000). He made his Ipswich debut on 4 November 1972 at Portman Road in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Leeds United. His first goal for the club came on 2 December the same year in the 1‚Äì1 draw with Manchester City at Maine Road. By the end of his first season Johnson had helped Ipswich to the Texaco Cup final where they met East Anglian derby rivals Norwich City. After the two legged final Ipswich emerged victorious, winning 4‚Äì2 on aggregate by winning both legs 2‚Äì1. The following season Ipswich drew Spanish giants Real Madrid in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Ipswich beat their illustrious counterparts by a goal to nil at home and held Real to a goalless draw at the Bernab√©u in front of 80,000 supporters. In the next round Italian side S.S. Lazio. 4‚Äì0 down with just 20 minutes remaining, Johnson had the ball when Giancarlo Oddi went to close him down. Oddi then put in a waist high challenge which left Johnson in a heap on the ground holding his groin. Johnson had to be stretchered off and missed the following three fixtures as a consequence. Johnson returned from the injury for the return leg in Rome and took up his place on the bench. He watched as Lazio scored early and then again before half-time. A penalty was despatched by Colin Viljoen for Ipswich. Lazio then scored two more goals to put the tie back in the balance. In the 88th minute with the score 5‚Äì4 on aggregate, Robson turned to Johnson. With virtually his first touch he scored the goal that would finally settle the tie in Ipswich's favour. Ipswich beat Dutch side FC Twente in the next round but went out in the quarter finals to East German side Locomotiv Leipzig 4‚Äì3 on penalties after the sides had drawn 1‚Äì1 during normal and extra time. He scored 35 goals in his four seasons at the club as a battling, play-linking forward forging a productive partnership with Trevor Whymark. It was during his time at Ipswich that Johnson was called up by Don Revie for his first cap for England. He made his debut in a British Home Championship match at Wembley on 21 May 1975. Wales were the visitors with the game ending 2‚Äì2 with Johnson scoring both the goals. He also scored twice in a 3‚Äì1 victory over world champions Argentina at Wembley, a game which saw the first appearance in England of Diego Maradona. Johnson was in Ron Greenwood's squad for the 1980 European Championships but found himself behind Gary Birtles and the man that replaced him at Ipswich Paul Mariner. He won eight caps scoring six times in those appearances. In 1976 Tottenham Hotspur put in an unsuccessful bid for around ¬£200,000 for Johnson did not want to move. However, after 137 league appearances for the Ipswich he returned to Merseyside. Liverpool Johnson signed for Liverpool. He made his debut for the club on 21 August 1976 in a 1‚Äì0 league win over Norwich at Anfield. He scored his first goal a week later on the 28th, but his goal was not enough to prevent Birmingham City beating Liverpool 2‚Äì1 at St Andrews. In his first season, he was a frequent substitute, vying for the right to partner Kevin Keegan with both John Toshack and David Fairclough. In his debut season Liverpool were chasing an historic treble of League championship, FA Cup and European Cup as the season drew to a close. Johnson picked up his first domestic honour with the League title and was selected as Keegan's strike partner for the 1977 FA Cup Final at Wembley, but Liverpool lost 2‚Äì1 to Manchester United. Johnson made little impact and was substituted by Ian Callaghan in the second half. For the 1977 European Cup final against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in Rome three days later, manager Bob Paisley kept the team that had ended the match at Wembley, so Callaghan started and Johnson was on the bench. He picked up a medal as Liverpool won 3‚Äì1. In April 1978, Johnson scored for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park ‚Äì becoming the very first player to score for both clubs in the Merseyside derby. As of 2018, only one other player ‚Äì Peter Beardsley ‚Äì has achieved this feat since. In 1979 and 1980 Johnson was a free-scoring centre forward as Liverpool regained and then retained the title, and in 1981 he played as Liverpool won their third European Cup (against Real Madrid in the final) and their first League Cup (against West Ham United). However, a sign of things to come was in that first League Cup success. After the first game at Wembley ended 1‚Äì1, Johnson was on the bench for the replay due to Paisley's decision to try out the young Ian Rush. Rush never scored but played well and the following year he was the regular partner to Kenny Dalglish with Johnson being used less frequently. Johnson did enough to win a final league championship medal in 1982 and also won the League Cup again, after getting the substitute's jersey for the final (against Tottenham Hotspurs). Return to Everton and loan to Barnsley He returned to Everton in August 1982 for ¬£100,000. He did not see out his second season at Goodison after initially being loaned to Barnsley. Later playing career He ended the 1983-84 season at Manchester City before spending the summer at American side Tulsa Roughnecks in the NASL. His last season of senior football was played at Preston North End. He then had a spell as player manager at Barrow AFC. After playing He currently works at Anfield, hosting in the corporate lounges. He can also be heard regularly on BBC Radio Merseyside as both a match summariser and also a regular contributor to the station's Red Alert programme aired on Fridays at 7.30 pm where he provides what is known during the show as \\"The Doc's Diagnosis\\".

Strictly speaking, TLV is a reserved term of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). TLVs issued by the ACGIH are the most widely accepted occupational exposure limits both in the United States and most other countries. However, it is sometimes loosely used to refer to other similar concepts used in occupational health and toxicology, such as acceptable daily intake (ADI) and tolerable daily intake (TDI). Concepts such as TLV, ADI, and TDI can be compared to the no-observed- adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in animal testing, but whereas a NOAEL can be established experimentally during a short period, TLV, ADI, and TDI apply to human beings over a lifetime and thus are harder to test empirically and are usually set at lower levels. TLVs, along with biological exposure indices (BEIs), are published annually by the ACGIH. The TLV is an estimate based on the known toxicity in humans or animals of a given chemical substance, and the reliability and accuracy of the latest sampling and analytical methods. It is not a static definition since new research can often modify the risk assessment of substances and new laboratory or instrumental analysis methods can improve analytical detection limits. The TLV is a recommendation by ACGIH, with only a guideline status. As such, it should not be confused with exposure limits having a regulatory status, like those published and enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The OSHA regulatory exposure limits permissible exposure limits (PELs) published in 29CFR 1910.1000 Table Z1 are based on recommendations made by the ACGIH in 1968, although other exposure limits were adopted more recently. Many OSHA exposure limits are not considered by the industrial hygiene community to be sufficiently protective levels since the toxicological basis for most limits have not been updated since the 1960s. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) publishes recommended exposure limits (RELs) which OSHA takes into consideration when promulgating new regulatory exposure limits.  Definitions of TLV  The TLV for chemical substances is defined as a concentration in air, typically for inhalation or skin exposure. Its units are in parts per million (ppm) for gases and in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) for particulates such as dust, smoke and mist. The basic formula for converting between ppm and mg/m3 for gases is ppm = (mg/m^3) * 24.45 / molecular weight. This formula is not applicable to airborne particles. Three types of TLVs for chemical substances are defined: # Threshold limit value ‚àí time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule # Threshold limit value ‚àí short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): A 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. # Threshold limit value ‚àí ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time There are TLVs for physical agents as well as chemical substances. TLVs for physical agents include those for noise exposure, vibration, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation exposure and heat and cold stress.  Defining acceptable exposure The TLV and most other occupational exposure limits are based on available toxicology and epidemiology data to protect nearly all workers over a working lifetime. Exposure assessments in occupational settings are most often performed by Occupational / Industrial Hygiene (OH/IH) professionals who gather \\"Basic Characterization\\" consisting of all relevant information and data related to workers, agents of concern, materials, equipment and available exposure controls. The exposure assessment is initiated by selecting the appropriate exposure limit averaging time and \\"decision statistic\\" for the agent. Typically the statistic for deciding acceptable exposure is chosen to be the majority (90%, 95% or 99%) of all exposures to be below the selected occupational exposure limit. For retrospective exposure assessments performed in occupational environments, the \\"decision statistic\\" is typically a central tendency such as the mean or geometric mean or median for each worker or group of workers. Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in \\"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock\\". \\"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock AIHA Press\\" http://iweb.aiha.org/iweb/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=AEAK06-327/ Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information  Similar concepts The TLV is equivalent in spirit to various occupational exposure limits developed by organizations around the world; however, the materials covered, values recommended, and definitions used can differ amongst organizations. These occupational exposure limits include: =United States = *WEEL (Workplace Environmental Exposure Level), formerly created by a committee of the American Industrial Hygiene Association; as of January 1, 2012, new WEELs are created by a committee of volunteers that is supported by the Occupational Alliance for Risk Science. =Other countries= *Australia **OES Occupational exposure standard *Austria **TRK (Technische Richtkonzentration trans.

Founded in 1986 by Frederic Hauge and Rune Haaland as a direct action protest group to curb Norway's oil and gas industry pollution, it became multi-disciplinary and international in scope and now maintains offices in Oslo, Murmansk, St. Petersburg, Brussels and Washington, D.C. To achieve its goal Bellona employs ecologists, scientists with expertise ranging from the natural to the social sciences, engineers, economists, lawyers, and journalists.  Goals  Through branches located in Europe and North America, Bellona works with groups of environmental activists, scientific experts, governments, and other NGOs to address environmental problems, find sustainable solutions and move towards the green society. These include dealing with climate change fall-out, the clean-up of the Cold War nuclear legacy in Russia, and the safety of the oil and gas extraction and processing in Norway and Europe.About Bellona, Official website In 1998, the so-called \\"B7\\" partnership program with the private sector was developed by Bellona. It specified preferential goals, individual projects and programs to deal with the environmental concerns and issues. Altogether, seven focus areas were determined: environmental rights, international environment work, environmental management, environmental economy, environmental technology, energy and Envirofacts.  History  In 1994, the Bellona Foundation's report \\"Sources of Radioactive Contamination in Murmansk and Archangel Counties\\" raised serious concerns about the safety of the decommissioned soviet nuclear- powered submarines after the dissolution of the USSR.Took, Roger. Running with Reindeer Encounters in Russian Lapland. Boulder, Colo: Westview Press, 2004. In February 1996, Russian FSB arrested Bellona's Russian expert Alexander Nikitin, a former Soviet naval officer, and charged him with treason through espionage for his contributions to Bellona's report on the nuclear safety within the Russian Northern Fleet. He was fully acquitted by the Russian Supreme Court in 2000. In 2003, Bellona accessed radioactive contamination at Sellafield nuclear reprocessing facility in England.Bellona Report No. 8: Sellafield , Oslo: The Bellona Foundation, 2003. At the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) in Copenhagen, Bellona presented \\"101 Solutions to Climate Change\\".Meg Lowman. The Bellona solution, Herald-Tribune, February 15, 2010.Bellona presents 101 Solutions In 2013, Bellona Foundation filed a police report after it learned that a \\"disposal well in the Norwegian Sea owned by Norway‚Äôs state oil company Statoil leaked 3,428 tons of hazardous chemicals and oil based drilling fluids over six years at the Njord site\\".Charles Digges. Bellona files police report against Statoil over six years of chemicals leaked into Norwegian Sea, Nuclear-News, 11 October 2013.  Strategy  More than 100 businesses, organization and enterprises have partaken in the Bellona foundation's B7-program, since it was introduced in 1998. In 2003, among Bellona's B7 partnership program with business and industry were: Aker Kv√¶rner, Aker RGI, Applied Plasma Physics, Bertel O. Steen, Braathens, Conoco Phillips Norway, Coop Norge, E-CO, Eidesvik, Eiendomsspar, Energos Energy and Industry, Eramet, Ferrolegeringens Forskningsforening, Norwegian Fishing Vessels Owners Association, Fred Olsen, Marine Harvest, Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry (NHO), Federation of Norwegian Processing Industries (PIL), Norway Post, Select Service Partner, Water Power Industries (WPI), Uniteam, Norske Shel, Skretting, Statkraft, and Statoil.Bellona Report ‚Ññ 7, 2003. The organization's cooperation with industry and business came about as a result of recognition by the Bellona Foundation that the environmental movement alone would not be able to impel the necessary changes in order to counter the impending threats against environment. Through B7 program, Bellona wanted to aid those enterprises that were willing to take the environment protection in earnest. It also wanted to offer businesses an arena on which they could take the step from being a part of the problem to becoming a part of the solution. Bellona has also been involved in the promotion of renewable energy in Russia.  Funding  In 2001, the annual budget of Bellona was 25 million Norwegian kroner (NOK). Among the sources: 10 million Norwegian kroner came from selling advertising; 6 million was received from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for projects in Russia, and 1 million was received from the Norwegian government for general purposes; 6 million was received from business sector to implement the B7 program; 2 million came from sales of reports, donations and gifts.Cecilie L√∏ne.

For decades prior to the construction of One Liberty Place, there had been a \\"gentlemen's agreement‚Äù in place ensuring that no building in Philadelphia would be approved that rose above the William Penn statue on City Hall. The curse ended on October 29, 2008, when the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series, a year and four months after a statuette of the William Penn figure atop City Hall was affixed to the final beam during the June 2007 topping-off of the Comcast Center, thus making this statuette the highest William Penn figure in the city at the time. Origins of the curse Atop Philadelphia City Hall stands a statue of William Penn, the city founder and original proprietor of the then-British colony of Pennsylvania (meaning \\"Penn's Woods\\"). For years, a \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" stated that the Philadelphia Art Commission would approve no building in the city which would rise above this statue. This ended in March 1987, when a modern steel-and-glass skyscraper, One Liberty Place, opened three blocks away. One Liberty Place is taller than City Hall by 397 feet (121 m), rising 945 feet (288 m) in height compared to the height of Penn's hat on City Hall, 547 feet (167 m). Its sister skyscraper, Two Liberty Place, at 848 ft (258 m), followed in 1990. Philadelphia sports teams had enjoyed a run of success. Major League Baseball's Phillies won the 1980 World Series and the 1983 National League pennant; the National Hockey League's Flyers won back-to-back Stanley Cups in and , and appeared in the finals in , , , and ; the National Football League's Eagles appeared in Super Bowl XV following the 1980 season, losing to the Oakland Raiders; and the National Basketball Association's 76ers swept the 1983 NBA Finals, as well as making the finals in , , and . Before 1980, the Phillies had appeared in only two other World Series, in and , and the Eagles had won no NFC conference championships since the 1966 agreement that had created the Super Bowl, while the 76ers won NBA titles in both Philadelphia and in their previous incarnation, the Syracuse Nationals. The Villanova Wildcats won the 1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball tournament, in one of the most famous upsets in sports history. Construction on One Liberty Place began in 1985, two years after the last championship season in Philadelphia. Philadelphia sports since the curse's inception = Major-league sports= View of Philadelphia skyline from Citizens Bank Park in 2004. William Penn's statue can be seen one-quarter from the right. Note height relationship to the newer buildings to the left. The tallest building (with antenna) is One Liberty Place opened, Philadelphia's franchises began a pattern of failures to win a world championship. The Flyers lost the Stanley Cup Finals twice, in to the Edmonton Oilers in seven games (although the Oilers were heavily favored), two months after One Liberty Place opened, and in , in a four-game sweep by the Detroit Red Wings which was considered a collapse as the Flyers had home-ice advantage and had dominated the previous three playoff series en route to meeting the Red Wings. The Phillies upset the Atlanta Braves to win the NLCS, but then lost the 1993 World Series in six games to the Toronto Blue Jays, with the Series ending on Joe Carter's walkoff 3-run home run. The 76ers lost the 2001 NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games, although the defending champion Lakers were favored despite the Sixers having league MVP Allen Iverson. The Eagles lost three straight NFC Championship games from the 2001 through 2003 seasons, before reaching Super Bowl XXXIX after the 2004 season, only to lose to the New England Patriots by three points. In fact, the only years that Philadelphia's franchises reached their league's championship round after One Liberty Place opened were years that U.S. presidents were inaugurated, except for the Flyers in 1987, and losses during such years date back to the 76ers loss in . When the Flyers played for the 2010 Stanley Cup, The Ottawa Citizen reported that the main reason for that lengthy championship drought was because the only years the city's teams played for championships during that time were years presidents were inaugurated. The city's teams had lost championships during such years, beginning with the 76ers themselves in . The exceptions were the Phillies in and the Flyers in . In addition, losses in semifinal rounds had occurred eight times since the opening of One Liberty Place. Five of these semi-final eliminations were by the Flyers, in 1989, 1995, 2000, 2004 and 2008. The 2000 team was one win away from a Stanley Cup Finals appearance, after leading the eventual champion New Jersey Devils 3-1 before losing three straight (including Games 5 and 7 at home), the 2004 team lost Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the eventual champion Tampa Bay Lightning, and the 2008 team lost to their cross-state rival Pittsburgh Penguins in five games. The Eagles accounted for the other three conference- final losses; they lost the NFC Championship Game (the winner of which meets the winner of the AFC's corresponding game in the Super Bowl) three years in a row from to , thus becoming the first NFL team to do this in either conference since the Dallas Cowboys of ‚Äì, losing the last two at home after posting the best record in the NFC. No other team in NFL history had lost back-to-back conference title games at home since the NFL began its practice in 1975 of awarding home-field advantage in postseason play based on regular-season record. The Eagles lost the 2001 NFC Championship game on the road to the St. Louis Rams 29-24, the 2002 NFC Championship game at home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 27-10, and the 2003 NFC Championship game to the Carolina Panthers 14-3. The Rams and Panthers would both lose to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI and Super Bowl XXXVIII, while the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII over the Oakland Raiders. During the period of the alleged Curse of Billy Penn, Philadelphia sports fans were infamous for rude and unsportsmanlike behavior. Fans pelted national TV broadcasters with snowballs, ice, and beer during a Cowboys-Eagles game in 1989 known as \\"Bounty Bowl II\\". On Nov. 10, 1997, an Eagles fan shot a flare gun across the field into the stands during a nationally televised Monday night game against the San Francisco 49ers. In 1999, Sports Illustrated blamed the fans' behavior on their teams' longtime poor quality of play, as seen in the 40-year championship drought for the Eagles and the 76ers' 1972-1973 season, which was the worst in NBA history at 9-73.'There's no excuse for what we did': Philadelphia fans criticized for reaction to Irvin injury, Sports Illustrated, 1999-10-14. Accessed 2007-06-26. =Other sports= Bronze statue of William Penn atop Philadelphia City Hall The curse was also said to have affected Bensalem-Township-based thoroughbred racehorse Smarty Jones, who saw his bid for horse racing's Triple Crown disappear when he finished second in the 2004 Belmont Stakes behind 36-1 longshot Birdstone after victories in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. The curse has also been blamed for the death of the thoroughbred horse Barbaro, who was owned and bred by a couple from West Grove, a borough outside Philadelphia. Though Barbaro won the 2006 Kentucky Derby, his leg was dramatically shattered two weeks later during the 2006 Preakness Stake, leading to the horse's death. Although the curse was not generally considered as extending to college sports, two Philadelphia-area college basketball teams, the St. Joseph's Hawks (in Philadelphia) and the Villanova Wildcats (in Villanova), which had successful seasons in 2004 and 2006, respectively, failed to reach the Final Four of the NCAA Basketball Tournament. Both were eliminated in the fourth-round Elite Eight matches, with St. Joe's, first seed in the East Regional, losing in a close match to Oklahoma State, and Villanova, first seed in the Minneapolis Regional, falling to eventual NCAA-champion Florida. Villanova won the national championship in 1985, two years before the Liberty Place opening. A third Philadelphia-area team, the Temple Owls (in Philadelphia) has also lost five times in the Elite Eight (1988, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2001). Villanova ended the college basketball drought for the Philadelphia teams with a national championship in 2016 and 2018. The curse, however, was apparently not extended to professional teams outside the four major sports. The then‚ÄìPhiladelphia Wings of the NLL (indoor lacrosse winter league) won six titles between 1989 and 2001, before moving in 2014, and the now-defunct Philadelphia Barrage of the MLL (outdoor summer lacrosse league) won three championships (2004, 2006, and 2007). The AHL's Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers' top minor-league affiliate from 1996 to 2009, won the Calder Cup championship in 1998 and 2005. Additionally, the Philadelphia KiXX of the MISL won their league's championship in 2002 and 2007. The AFL's Philadelphia Soul won ArenaBowl XXII in 2008, ArenaBowl XXIX in 2016, and ArenaBowl XXX in 2017 before the league folded in 2019. The Philadelphia Freedoms, a tennis team in the World Team Tennis league, also won titles in 2001 and 2006. One exception was the Philadelphia Charge, a women's soccer team in the now-defunct WUSA, which did not win a championship during the three years the WUSA existed, from 2001 to 2003. Decoration of Penn's statue In spite of the Curse, when Philadelphia sports teams have reached their league's championship round, Penn's statue has sometimes been decorated to support that team's success. For example, after the Phillies won the 1993 National League pennant, Penn was fitted with an oversized red Phillies baseball cap; when the Flyers went to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, the city adorned Penn with an orange-torso-with-white-shoulders Flyers jersey (at the time, the combination was the Flyers' road jersey). When the Sixers faced the Lakers in the 2001 NBA Finals, Penn's statue was not decorated. Pat Croce, president and part-owner of the Sixers, said he would have \\"decked out\\" the statue had the Sixers won but not before. Penn's statue was also left untouched when the Eagles went to Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. The Curse lifted On June 18, 2007, ironworkers helped raise the final beam in the construction of the Comcast Center at 17th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard in downtown Philadelphia. In an attempt to end the curse, workers John Joyce and Dan Ginion attached a small figurine of William Penn to the beam, along with the traditional American flag and small evergreen tree. After the first William Penn figurine was stolen, it was replaced with a smaller 4-inch figure. On October 29, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies won the 2008 World Series in five games against the Tampa Bay Rays, ending the alleged Curse. It was the first major league professional sports title for the city of Philadelphia since the 1983 NBA Championship. During the TV coverage of the parade which occurred two days later, Comcast aired an ad congratulating the Phillies which featured the small figurine of William Penn standing at the top of the Comcast Center. On November 27, 2017, the day of the \\"topping out\\" of the new tallest building in Philadelphia the Comcast Technology Center, ironworkers once again placed a new William Penn figurine atop the building's highest beam in hopes to ward off the curse. On February 4, 2018, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII 41-33 to win their first Super Bowl in team history, and first championship since the 1960 NFL Championship.

He served in the Italian campaign during the Second World War and was twice decorated for bravery in action before he was killed by mortar fire the day after his VC action. Early life John Henry Cound Brunt was born on 6 December 1922, on a farm in Priest Weston, near Chirbury, Shropshire to Thomas Henry Brunt and Nesta Mary Brunt (n√©e Cound), and began his education at Chirbury village school. He had an elder sister named Dorothy (born 13 May 1920) and a younger sister Isobel (born 5 October 1923). When Dorothy was eight, the family moved to a farm near Whittington, Shropshire, where John grew up. As he became older, his fearless nature became more apparent; every week, he read the comic Tiny Tots, which featured instructions on \\"How to teach yourself to swim\\". One day, he asked Dorothy to take him to the Shropshire Canal, which went through their farmland. Before his sister could stop him, Brunt had taken off all his clothes and jumped into the canal. When they finally arrived home, their mother wanted to know why he had no clothes on, and John responded that he had been teaching himself to swim. As he got older, his daredevil attitude became even more serious; on one occasion, he was found swinging himself along the guttering of a Dutch barn above the farmyard. When old enough, Brunt was enrolled at Ellesmere College, where his mischievous streak became quickly apparent through pranks and dares; once, while in the sanatorium with mumps, he slipped a laxative into the matron's tea. Nevertheless, he is fondly remembered at the school. It was while he was at Ellesmere that he contracted measles, resulting in his need to wear glasses. An enthusiastic sportsman, Brunt played cricket, hockey, rugby, water polo and wrestling. He was the only pupil at the school to tackle the headmaster while playing rugby, injuring the older man's knee in the process. In 1934, the Brunt family moved to Paddock Wood in Kent and, in his school holidays, \\"Young John\\" (as he was known in the village) would come home. Although he was still a reckless individual, he was thought of very highly, and helped train the Paddock Wood Home Guard between 1940 and 1943, assisted by his father. He spent his last days in Paddock Wood helping with the hop harvest. Military career Brunt joined the British Army when he left school, training as a private soldier with the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment in 1941, during the Second World War. He received a commission as a second lieutenant on 2 January 1943, and was posted to North Africa. Although he was commissioned in the Sherwood Foresters, he never served with them, instead being posted to the 6th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment (6th Lincolns), a Territorial Army (TA) unit, having become friendly with Captain Alan Money, an officer in the Lincolns, on the boat to North Africa. The battalion was part of the 138th Infantry Brigade of the 46th Infantry Division. The division was then commanded by Major General John Hawkesworth. On 9 September 1943, Brunt's battalion landed at Salerno as part of the Allied invasion of Italy and Brunt, now a lieutenant, was given command of No.9 Platoon in 'A' Company. The unit subsequently moved south-east to establish a base in a farm near the river Asa. =Military Cross= Between December 1943 and January 1944, during the Bernhardt Line fighting, Brunt commanded a battle patrol and saw near-constant action. In the early hours of 15 December, they received orders to destroy an enemy post based in some houses north of the River Peccia. In efforts to break the enemy line, he crossed and re-crossed the river so many times that the troops took to calling it \\"Brunt's Brook\\". After an intense five-minute bombardment, Brunt led a section into an assault. The first two houses contained two enemy soldiers, but it was the third house that provided the most resistance. Using grenades and Tommy guns, they managed to kill eight enemy troops outside the house, as well as those inside, all belonging to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Hermann Goering Panzer Grenadier Regiment. After thirty minutes of intense fighting, the patrol withdrew, having had one man killed and six wounded. While the rest of the section pulled back, Brunt remained behind with his sergeant and a private to retrieve a wounded soldier. For his actions, he was awarded the Military Cross (MC). On 5 January 1944, Brunt was in a sick bed in a rear hospital. He pleaded with doctors to be allowed to leave to take part in an attack, and was given permission, leading his patrol under heavy fire. He was back in the hospital 24 hours later with concussion after a piece of shrapnel almost split his helmet, but would have carried on fighting if it had not been for a non-commissioned officer (NCO), who forcibly led him away from the front line. At the end of the campaign, Brunt is said to have commented to his friends, \\"I've won the MC, now for the VC!\\" =Victoria Cross= Brunt's division left Italy in March 1944, and was sent to Syria and Egypt to rest and retrain, before returning to Italy in July 1944. Having been promoted to temporary captain, Brunt was appointed second- in-command (2IC) of 'D' Company. By early December 1944, after being engaged in heavy fighting in the Gothic Line offensive, the battalion was operating near Ravenna, fighting German troops who were retreating north through Italy. On the night of 3 December, the battalion began their attack on the town of Faenza. By the evening of 6 December, they had taken the village of Ragazzina near Faenza, and after heavy fighting the 6th Lincolns established defensive positions in Faenza itself. For his actions during the engagement, Brunt was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The full citation for the award appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette of 6 February 1945, reading: The next morning, having won the battle and the acclaim of his regiment, Captain Brunt was as eager to return to the offensive, keeping alert for more trouble as breakfast was being prepared for the men, their first meal in 48 hours. He was standing in the doorway of the platoon headquarters, having a mug of tea and chatting with friends, when a stray German mortar bomb landed at his feet, killing him outright. He had celebrated his 22nd birthday just four days before. John Brunt is buried at Faenza War Cemetery in Italy under a Commonwealth War Grave headstone; his VC was announced posthumously in February 1945. Victoria Cross presentation On 18 December 1945, King George VI presented Brunt's VC and MC to his parents at Buckingham Palace. Brunt's father met Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI, later redesignated 15th Army Group) throughout most of the Italian Campaign, at the ceremony and said to him \\"I expect that you know many men who should have been awarded this medal\\", to which Alexander replied \\"No, because there is always only one who will do the unexpected and that day it was your son.\\" Legacy John Brunt V.C. pub in Paddock Wood, unveiled on 9 November 2008 In 1946, John Brunt's sister Dorothy gave birth to a boy which she named John Brunt Miller, in honour of his uncle. On 3 September 1947 the Kent Arms public house in Paddock Wood, Kent, was renamed the John Brunt V.C. in his honour. In 1997, the pub's name was changed to The Hopping Hooden Horse; after local outrage the former name was restored in 2001. Behind the pub a small housing development called John Brunt VC Court was built. During his military career, Brunt was awarded the VC, MC, 1939-45 Star, Africa Star, Italy Star and the British War Medal 1939‚Äì1945, all of which are on display in Royal Lincolnshire Regiment and Lincolnshire Yeomanry Collections in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. In 1951 an altar rail in the Soldiers' Chapel of St George in Lincoln Cathedral was dedicated to his memory by the regiment. On 17 July 1965 The Victor comic featured a cover story named Brunt V.C., a two-page strip based on the actions that won Brunt the VC. A John Brunt Memorial Cricket Pavilion was opened at Ellesmere College in 1970, after funds were raised for it since 1945. The College's ante-chapel holds a photograph of Brunt with a copy of his VC citation displayed below. In May 2004 an outdoor plaque to his memory was unveiled in Priestweston.

History The first release on the Jet Records label, a UK top 10 for its singer and writer Lynsey de Paul in November 1974, followed by the de Paul album, Taste Me... Don't Waste Me. De Paul wrote the second single on the Jet label, a song called \\"My One and Only\\" recorded by the British female vocal group 'Bones'. The fourth single released on the label, \\"My Man and Me\\", was written and performed by de Paul and it was the second UK hit single released on Jet Records. De Paul released a second album entitled Love Bomb, before leaving the label in 1976 after an acrimonious split with Arden, resulting in her third Jet album Take Your Time (originally entitled Before You Go Tonight) being unreleased. ELO were managed by Arden from the band's inception in 1972. They were initially signed to Harvest Records (a division of EMI) in the UK and United Artists Records in the US. Roy Wood left ELO in 1972 and formed his own group, Wizzard. During 1973 and 1974, ELO and Wizzard moved from the Harvest label to Warner Bros. Records in the UK. In 1975, the two bands and Wood's solo releases moved again in the UK to Jet, with their recent Warner Bros. material becoming part of Jet's catalogue. In the UK, Jet Records were distributed first by Island Records in 1974-75, then by Polydor Records from 1975 to 1976, then by United Artists from 1976 to 1978. In the US, a small Jet logo started appearing on the United Artists label in 1975 for releases by ELO and Wood. The Jet label was first used in the US for Jeff Lynne's solo single \\"Doin' That Crazy Thing\\" in the summer of 1977 and subsequently for the ELO album Out of the Blue. Wood left Jet Records and disbanded Wizzard in 1976, after Jet refused to release Wizzard's third album Wizzo, because it was not deemed commercial enough. His final single on the Jet label was \\"Any Old Time Will Do\\". After Jet's UK distribution moved to United Artists (UA) in 1976, UA were distributing Jet Records in most countries of the world. This changed after American copies of Out of the Blue that were deemed defective, began appearing at discounted prices in record shops in the US and Canada affecting the album's sales. Jet sued UA and abruptly switched their distribution to CBS Records worldwide early in 1978. By this time ELO had become one of the most popular bands in the world, and Jet reissued ELO's back catalogue albums and some new singles in many different colours of vinyl. Many members of ELO also released solo albums or singles on Jet in the late 1970s. In 1980, ELO contributed half the music to the motion picture Xanadu, with the other half of the music being provided by the film's star Olivia Newton-John. Newton-John was signed to MCA Records whose sister company Universal was producing the movie. The Xanadu soundtrack and all its singles by both ELO and Newton-John were released on MCA Records in the USA and Canada, and on Jet Records elsewhere in the world. Black Sabbath were also managed by Don Arden, but they were never signed to Jet Records. However, when their singer Ozzy Osbourne left the band, he was signed to Jet. Two studio albums and one live album by Osbourne were released on Jet. Arden's daughter Sharon, who was working for her father, started dating Osbourne and eventually married him. Sharon took over managing Osbourne from her father, and Osbourne left Jet to go to the Epic label of Jet's distributor CBS.Sharon Osbourne: Unauthorized, Uncensored - Understood, Sue Crawford, Michael O'Mara; Updated edition 12 September 2013, Osbourne's defection along with ELO becoming less popular in the early 1980s contributed to Jet experiencing financial difficulties. Legal problems encountered by Don Arden, and his son David, further strained Jet's resources. ELO's recording contract and back catalogue were sold by Jet to CBS in 1985. Initial copies of ELO's 1986 album Balance of Power were pressed on the Jet label in some European countries, but this mistake was corrected by CBS, and the album was then issued throughout Europe on its Epic label. American reissues by CBS of ELO's 1972 to 1983 albums continued to show the Jet logo until 1990. ELO's back catalog is now handled by Sony's Legacy Recordings (except the Harvest albums, handled by Warner Music Group under the Parlophone label). Jet carried on in a diminished capacity in the late 1980s. Roy Wood returned to the label in 1987 to release the single \\"1-2-3\\". Just before closure, the label released Live at Fairfield Halls by Bucks Fizz, a group the label had previously had no connection with. 1989 shows the final JET Release under CBS distribution, with the Dan Priest produced LP/CD Bite the Bullet by BTB (US CD: JET ZK 44410; UK LP: JET 465089-1). In 1991, Bagdasarian Productions (owners of The Chipmunks) bought the production company offices and holdings from Arden, and reopened the record label Jet Records under the new name Chipmunk Records. In 1996, Jet released The Fall's album The Light User Syndrome and the single The Chiselers. Some of Jet's back catalogue has appeared in reissues or compilations in the 1990s and 2000s, on labels such as Edsel Records and Sanctuary Records, including the previously unreleased third Wizzard album, retitled Main Street. The third album that Lynsey de Paul recorded for Jet in 1976 Take Your Time also but was never released finally appeared on CD in Japan with the title Before You Go Tonight on the Vivid Sound Corporation label in 1990. De Paul finally recovered the rights to her songs recorded for Jet Records and many of them were released on her 2013 anthology albums Sugar and Beyond and Into My Music.

Holbrook was the first submariner to be awarded the VC and it was the first naval VC gazetted in the First World War.(The first naval award for the First World War to Commander Henry Peel Ritchie RN in November 1914 was not gazetted until April 1915.) Early life Holbrook was born 9 July 1888 in Southsea, Hampshire. He was educated privately and at Portsmouth Grammar School. In 1903, he enrolled in the officer training establishment Britannia Royal Naval College and was appointed midshipman on 9 January 1905. He joined the submarine depot ship on 4 April 1911, served in submarines , and before taking command of HMS B11 on 30 December 1913.John Winton. The Victoria Cross at sea, Michael Joseph, 1978, . World War I Holbrook was 26 years old, a lieutenant in the Royal Navy during the First World War when on 13 December 1914 at the Dardanelles, Turkey, he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He was in command of the submarine , an old and obsolete craft built in 1905. Notwithstanding the difficulties of a treacherous current in the Dardanelles, he dived under five rows of mines and torpedoed and sank the , which was guarding the mine-field. In spite of being attacked by gunfire and torpedo boats, Holbrook succeeded in bringing the B11 back to the Mediterranean, When they got back to safety the B11 had been submerged for nine hours. Holbrook later achieved the rank of Commander. Death and legacy Holbrook died on 3 July 1976 at Midhurst, Sussex. He was buried at St James Old Churchyard, Stedham, West Sussex. He is probably the only VC recipient to have a town and (until May 2004) a local government area named for him. On 24 August 1915, amid a wave of anti-German feeling related to the First World War, the name of the New South Wales Eastern Riverina town of Germanton was changed to Holbrook to honour the recent VC recipient. He subsequently visited the town on three occasions. His widow, Mrs. Gundula Holbrook, donated his medal to the Council of the Shire of Holbrook in 1982. In 1995 she made a substantial donation towards the establishment of a submariners' memorial in the town, and in 1997 visited the town to unveil it. A bronze statue of Holbrook stands in Germanton Park, Holbrook. A scale model of the B11 in Holbrook Holbrook's medal was donated to the Council of the Shire of Holbrook, New South Wales in 1982. It subsequently passed to Greater Hume Shire Council upon the amalgamation of several Riverina shires in May 2004. Holbrook's medal group, including his Victoria Cross, went on display at the Australian War Memorial on 11 December 2009. His medals are on loan from the Greater Hume Shire Council. A replica may be seen at the Submarine Museum, Holbrook. Holbrook Road in Portsmouth is named after him. A plaque was erected by the Submariners Association in 2014 on the exterior wall of the Portsmouth Grammar school Junior School facing Cambridge Junction, Portsmouth, UK.

Early life Educated at Sydney Boys High School, graduating in 1957,http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/volume-54-no-3.pdf where he played 2nd XV for the school where he played alongside former Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs and Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks player George Taylforth and St. George Dragons halfback George Evans. Career Dwyer coached Sydney club Randwick to four Sydney championship wins before becoming Australia's national team coach. He coached Australia from 1982‚Äì83, and again from 1988. He coached Australia to victory at the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dwyer moved to Leicester Tigers after the game turned professional in 1996 and replaced Tony Russ. Tigers had immediate success, in 1997 reaching the Heineken Cup final and winning the Pilkington Cup, but finished fourth in the league. Dwyer's harsh attitude to the players led to them dubbing him 'Barb Dwyer' ('barbed wire') and a public spat with one of them, Austin Healey ensued. The club's board decided to replace Dwyer with former club captain Dean Richards. In 1998 Dwyer was appointed head coach of recently relegated Bristol. Under him the club returned to the Premiership at the first time of asking. The next season saw Bristol finish sixth in the top flight and narrowly miss out on qualification for the Heineken Cup. In 2000, Dwyer left Bristol after changes to the club's back room staff. In his time at Bristol Dwyer was a forceful advocate for the club's potential to be the leading light in English rugby, \\"the potential here is greater than in any other rugby city in England, including Leicester\\". In 2001 Dwyer returned to Australia and became coach of the New South Wales Waratahs in Super Rugby (at the time known as Super 12). He led the Waratahs to an eighth-place finish in 2001 and their first semi-final in the competition in 2002. He resigned in 2003 after a fifth-place finish but stayed with the New South Wales union as a development officer. In 2011, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame, alongside all other Rugby World Cup- winning head coaches and captains through the 2007 edition. Books He has written two autobiographies - The Winning Way (1992) and Full Time: A coach's Memoirs (2004).

Cognitive walkthrough is task-specific, whereas heuristic evaluation takes a holistic view to catch problems not caught by this and other usability inspection methods. The method is rooted in the notion that users typically prefer to learn a system by using it to accomplish tasks, rather than, for example, studying a manual. The method is prized for its ability to generate results quickly with low cost, especially when compared to usability testing, as well as the ability to apply the method early in the design phases before coding even begins (a common trait with usability testing). Introduction A cognitive walkthrough starts with a task analysis that specifies the sequence of steps or actions required by a user to accomplish a task, and the system responses to those actions. The designers and developers of the software then walk through the steps as a group, asking themselves a set of questions at each step. Data is gathered during the walkthrough, and afterwards a report of potential issues is compiled. Finally the software is redesigned to address the issues identified. The effectiveness of methods such as cognitive walkthroughs is hard to measure in applied settings, as there is very limited opportunity for controlled experiments while developing software. Typically measurements involve comparing the number of usability problems found by applying different methods. However, Gray and Salzman called into question the validity of those studies in their dramatic 1998 paper \\"Damaged Merchandise\\", demonstrating how very difficult it is to measure the effectiveness of usability inspection methods. The consensus in the usability community is that the cognitive walkthrough method works well in a variety of settings and applications.  Streamlined Cognitive Walkthrough Procedure  After the task analysis has been made, the participants perform the walkthrough: # Define inputs to the walkthrough: a usability specialist lays out the scenarios and produces an analysis of said scenarios through explanation of the actions required to accomplish the task. ## Identify users ## Create a sample task for evaluation ## Create action sequences for completing the tasks ## Implementation of interface # Convene the walkthrough: ## What are the goals of the walkthrough? ## What will be done during the walkthrough ## What will not be done during the walkthrough ## Post ground rules ### Some common ground rules #### No designing #### No defending a design #### No debating cognitive theory #### The usability specialist is the leader of the session ## Assign roles ## Appeal for submission to leadership # Walk through the action sequences for each task ## Participants perform the walkthrough by asking themselves a set of questions for each subtask. Typically four questions are as ##* Will the user try to achieve the effect that the subtask has? E.g. Does the user understand that this subtask is needed to reach the user's goal ##* Will the user notice that the correct action is available? E.g. is the button visible? ##* Will the user understand that the wanted subtask can be achieved by the action? E.g. the right button is visible but the user does not understand the text and will therefore not click on it. ##* Does the user get appropriate feedback? Will the user know that they have done the right thing after performing the action? ## By answering the questions for each subtask usability problems will be noticed. # Record any important information ## Learnability problems ## Design ideas and gaps ## Problems with analysis of the task # Revise the interface using what was learned in the walkthrough to improve the problems. The CW method does not take several social attributes into account. The method can only be successful if the usability specialist takes care to prepare the team for all possibilities during the cognitive walkthrough. This tends to enhance the ground rules and avoid the pitfalls that come with an ill-prepared team. Common shortcomings In teaching people to use the walkthrough method, Lewis & Rieman have found that there are two common misunderstandings: # The evaluator doesn't know how to perform the task themself, so they stumble through the interface trying to discover the correct sequence of actions‚Äîand then they evaluate the stumbling process. (The user should identify and perform the optimal action sequence.) # The walkthrough method does not test real users on the system. The walkthrough will often identify many more problems than you would find with a single, unique user in a single test session There are social constraints to the inhibit the cognitive walkthrough process. These include time pressure, lengthy design discussions and design defensiveness. Time pressure is caused when design iterations occur late in the development process, when a development team usually feels considerable pressure to actually implement specifications, and may not think they have the time to evaluate them properly. Many developers feel that CW's are not efficient because of the amount of time they take and the time pressures that they are facing. A design team spends their time trying to resolve the problem, during the CW instead of after the results have been formulated. Evaluation time is spent re-designing, this inhibits the effectiveness of the walkthrough and leads to lengthy design discussions. Many times, designers may feel personally offended that their work is even being evaluated. Due to the fact that and walk-though would likely lead to more work on a project that they already are under pressure to complete in the allowed time, designers will over defend their design during the walkthrough. They are more likely to be argumentative and reject changes that seem obvious. History The method was developed in the early nineties by Wharton, et al., and reached a large usability audience when it was published as a chapter in Jakob Nielsen's seminal book on usability, \\"Usability Inspection Methods\\". The Wharton, et al. method required asking four questions at each step, along with extensive documentation of the analysis. In 2000 there was a resurgence in interest in the method in response to a CHI paper by Spencer who described modifications to the method to make it effective in a real software development setting. Spencer's streamlined method required asking only two questions at each step, and involved creating less documentation. Spencer's paper followed the example set by Rowley, et al. who described the modifications to the method that they made based on their experience applying the methods in their 1992 CHI paper \\"The Cognitive Jogthrough\\". Originally designed as a tool to evaluate interactive systems, such as postal kiosks, automated teller machines (ATMs), and interactive museum exhibits, where users would have little to no experience with using this new technology. However, since its creation, the method has been applied with success to complex systems like CAD software and some software development tools to understand the first experience of new users.

Settled over a thousand years ago, the surrounding area contains many archeological and historical sites such as religious temples (heiaus) and also includes the spot where the first documented European to reach the Hawaiian islands, Captain James Cook, was killed. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii in 1973 as the Kealakekua Bay Historical District. The bay is a marine life conservation district, a popular destination for kayaking, scuba diving, and snorkeling. Ancient history Settlement on Kealakekua Bay has a long history. Hikiau Heiau was a luakini temple of Ancient Hawaii at the south end of the bay, at coordinates , associated with funeral rites. The large platform of volcanic rock was originally over high, long, and wide.Van James, Ancient Sites of Hawaii, 1995, Mutual Publishing, Page 94 The sheer cliff face called Pali Kapu O Ke≈çua overlooking the bay was the burial place of Hawaiian royalty. The name means \\"forbidden cliffs of Ke≈çua \\" in honor of Ke≈çua Nui. He was sometimes known as the \\"father of kings\\" since many rulers were his descendants. The difficulty in accessing the cliff kept the exact burial places secret. The village of Kaawaloa was at the north end of the bay in ancient times, where the Puhina O Lono Heiau was built, along with some royal residences. The name of the village means \\"the distant Kava\\", from the medicinal plant used in religious rituals. The name of the bay comes from ke ala ke kua in the Hawaiian Language which means \\"the god's pathway.\\" This area was the focus of extensive Makahiki celebrations in honor of the god Lono. Another name for the area north of the bay was hale ki'i, due to the large number of wood carvings, often mistakingly called today as \\"tiki\\". Captain Cook and Kalani ª≈çpu ªu Kaawaloa in 1779 by John Webber, artist aboard Cook's ship Although there are theories that Spanish or Dutch sailors might have stopped here much earlier, the first documented European to arrive was Captain James Cook. He and his crews on the Resolution and Discovery sighted Kealakekua Bay on the morning of January 17, 1779. He estimated several thousand people lived in the two villages, and many thousand more in the surrounding areas. On January 28, he performed the first Christian service on the islands, for the funeral of a crew member who had died. Cook had entered the bay during Makahiki a traditionally peaceful time. Cook and his men were welcomed, given much food and gifts from the island and treated as honored guests. John Ledyard, the only American on board Cook's third voyage, gives a detailed account of these events in his journals. Cook and his crew stayed for several weeks, returning to sea shortly after the end of the festival. After suffering damage to the mast during a storm, the ships returned two weeks later on February 12. This time, already fraying relations came to a head. One of Cook's captains accused a native chieftain of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. The boat was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. Cook himself attempted to barter for the wood used to border the natives \\"Morai\\" or sacred burial ground for certain high-ranking individuals. The native chiefs were mortified at this offer and refused to accept it. Cook later took the wood anyway, against the will of native chieftains. With a damaged mast, fraying relations with the natives and being heavily outnumbered, Cook attempted to lure Hawaiian chief Kalani≈çpuu aboard his ship to hold him hostage in order to induce 'good behavior among the natives.' Tensions mounted as Cook attempted to trick the chief, and natives surrounded the beach. Cook fired the first shot, and his men quickly shot several more natives. As Cook and his men attempted to retreat, Cook was stabbed through the chest by a native chief with an iron dagger which had been traded from Cook's own ship previously in the same visit. The majority of Cook's body was never recovered. Since Cook's men felt they could not leave without resupplying fresh water and further repair of their damaged mast, they shot dozens more natives with their own muskets and the ships cannons and burned a portion of Kireekakooa, one of the towns in the bay. Cook's death was depicted in a series of paintings called Death of Cook. The monument is accessed by a one-hour hike from the road or by crossing the bay by boat. Turmoil An illustration of the Hikiau heiau at Kealakekua Bay, by William Ellis When Kalani≈çpuu died in 1782, his oldest son Kiwalao officially inherited the kingdom, but his nephew Kamehameha I became guardian of the god K≈´kailimoku. A younger son, Ke≈çua Kuahuula, was not happy about this and provoked Kamehameha. Their forces met just south of the bay at the battle of Moku≈çhai.Thomas S.Dye (2003) Archaeological Survey of a Portion of Keei Makai Kamehameha won control of the west and north sides of the island, but Ke≈çua escaped. It would take over a decade to consolidate Kamehameha's control. In 1786, merchant ships of the King George's Sound Company under command of the maritime fur traders Nathaniel Portlock and Captain George Dixon anchored in the harbor, but avoided coming ashore. They had been on Cook's voyage when he was killed by natives. In December 1788, the Iphigenia under William Douglas arrived with Chief Kaiana, who had already traveled to China. The first American ship was probably the Lady Washington around this time under Captain John Kendrick. Two sailors, Parson Howel and James Boyd, left the ship (in 1790 or when it returned in 1793) and lived on the island. In March 1790, the American ship Eleanora arrived at Kealakekua Bay and sent a British sailor ashore named John Young, to determine whether the sister ship, the schooner , had arrived for its planned rendezvous. Young was detained by Kamehameha's men to prevent the Eleanora's Captain Simon Metcalfe from hearing the news of the destruction of the Fair American, and the death of Metcalfe's son, Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, after the massacre at Olowalu. Young and Isaac Davis, the lone survivor of the Fair American, slowly adjusted to the island lifestyle. They instructed Hawaiians in the use of the captured cannon and muskets, becoming respected advisers to Kamehameha.\\"A Cultural History of Three Traditional Hawaiian Sites on the West Coast of Hawaii Island\\" by Diane Lee Rhodes, on National Park Service web site In 1791 Spanish explorer Manuel Quimper visited on the ship . More visitors Priests traveling across the bay for first contact rituals, by John Webber George Vancouver arrived in March 1792 to winter in the islands with a small fleet of British ships. He had been a young midshipman on Cook's fatal voyage 13 years earlier and commanded the party that attempted to recover Cook's remains. He avoided anchoring in Kealakekua Bay, but met some men in canoes who were interested in trading. The common request was for firearms, which Vancouver resisted. One included chief Kaiana, who would later turn against Kamehameha. Vancouver suspected Kaiana intended to seize his ships, so left him behind and headed up the coast. There he was surprised to encounter a Hawaiian who in broken English introduced himself as \\"Jack\\", and told of traveling to America on a fur-trading ship. Through him, Vancouver met Keeaumoku PƒÅpaiahiahi, who gave him a favorable impression of Kamehameha (his son-in-law). He spent the rest of the winter in Oahu. Vancouver returned in February 1793; this time he picked up Keeaumoku and anchored in Kealakekua Bay. When Kamehameha came to greet the ship, he brought John Young, now fluent in the Hawaiian language, as an interpreter. This greatly helped to develop a trusted trading relationship. The Hawaiians presented a war game, which was often part of the Makahiki celebration. Impressed by the warriors' abilities, Vancouver fired off some fireworks at night to demonstrate his military technology. Vancouver presented some cattle which he had picked up in California. They were weak and barely alive, so he convinced Kamehameha to avoid killing them for ten years. Scottish doctor James Lind had recommended the use of citrus juice to prevent scurvy on long voyages. The botanist Archibald Menzies had picked up some citrus fruit seeds in South Africa, and dropped them off here, so that future ships might be able to replenish their stocks at the Hawaiian islands.\\"Early Plant Introductions in Hawaii\\" by Kenneth M. Nagata, Hawaiian Journal of History, 1985 Ships in the bay (sketch by Rufus Anderson) Vancouver left in March 1793 after visiting the other islands to continue his expedition, and returned again January 13, 1794. He still hoped to broker a truce between Kamehameha and the other islands. His first step was to reconcile Kamehameha with Queen Kaahumanu. He dropped off more cattle and sheep from California, and discovered a cow left the year before had delivered a calf. The cattle became feral and eventually became pests. They were not controlled until the \\"Hawaiian cowboys\\", known as the paniolo, were recruited. The ship's carpenters instructed the Hawaiians and the British advisers how to build a European-style ship, which they named the Britania. On February 25, 1794, Vancouver gathered leaders from around the island onto his ship and negotiated a treaty. Although this treaty was sometimes described as \\"ceding\\" Hawaii to Great Britain, the treaty was never ratified by the British parliament. Decline For the next few years, Kamehameha was engaged in his war campaigns, and then spent his last years at Kamakahonu to the north. By this time other harbors such as Lahaina and Honolulu became popular with visiting ships. By 1804, the heiau was falling into disuse. In 1814, a British ship HMS Forester arrived in the midsts of a mutiny. Otto von Kotzebue arrived in 1816 on a mission from the Russian Empire. When Kamehameha I died in 1819, his oldest son Liholiho officially inherited the kingdom, calling himself Kamehameha II. His nephew Keaoua Kekuaokalani inherited the important military and religious post of guardian of K≈´kailimoku. However, true power was held by Kamehameha's widow Queen Kaahumanu. She had been convinced by Vancouver and other visitors that the European customs should be adopted. In the Ai Noa she declared an end to the old Kapu system. Kekuaokalani was outraged by this threat to the old traditions, which still were respected by most common people. He gathered religious supporters at Kaawaloa, threatening to take the kingdom by force, as happened 37 years earlier. After a failed attempt to negotiate peace, he marched his army north to meet Kalanimoku's troops who were gathered at Kamakahonu. They met in the Battle of Kuamoo. Both sides had muskets, but Kalanimoku had cannon mounted on double-hulled canoes. He devastated the fighters for the old religion, who still lie buried in the lava rock. Kiawe trees The wood Kii carvings were burned, and the temples fell into disrepair. A small Christian church was built in 1824 in Kaawaloa by the Hawaiian missionaries, and the narrow trail widened to a donkey cart road in the late 1820s, but the population declined due largely to introduced diseases and people shifted to other areas. In 1825, Admiral Lord Byron (cousin of the famous poet) on the ship erected a monument to Cook and took away many of the old, sacred artifacts. The last royalty known to live here was high chief Naihe, known as the \\"national orator,\\" and his wife Chiefess Kapiolani, early converts to Christianity. In 1829, she was saddened to see that the destruction of the temples included desecrating the bones of her ancestors at the Puuhonua o H≈çnaunau. She removed the remains of the old chiefs and hid them in the Pali Kapu O Ke≈çua cliffs before ordering this last temple to be destroyed. The bones were later moved to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii in 1858, under direction of King Kamehameha IV. In 1839 a massive stone church was built just south of the bay. It fell into ruin, and a smaller building called Kahikolu Church was built in 1852. This also fell into ruin, but has been rebuilt. In 1894 a wharf was constructed at the village at the south of the bay, now called Napoopoo. A steamer landed in the early 20th century when Kona coffee became a popular crop in the upland areas. A large white stone monument was built on the north shore of the bay in 1874 on the order of Princess Likelike and was deeded to the United Kingdom in 1877. The chain around the monument is supported by four cannon from the ship HMS Fantome; they were placed with their breaches embedded in the rock in 1876. It marks the approximate location of Cook's death. It is located at coordinates . Cook Monument on the northern shore of the bay The Cook monument is unreachable by road; this remote location is accessible only by water or an hour-long hike along a moderately steep trail. Many visitors have rented kayaks and paddled across the bay, about from its southern end. State conservation regulations prohibit kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, surfboards, and bodyboards from entering the bay unless part of a tour with a licensed local operator. The pier at Napoopoo can be accessed down a narrow road off the Hawaii Belt Road.Shoreline access map at Hawaii County web site The beach sand was mostly removed by Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Boat tours are also available, leaving from Honok≈çhau harbor, Keauhou Bay, and the Kailua pier. A short single-day eruption of Mauna Loa volcano took place underwater within Kealakekua Bay in 1877, and within a mile of the shoreline; curious onlookers approaching the area in boats reported unusually turbulent water and occasional floating blocks of hardened lava. Hawaiian spinner dolphins frequent Kealakekua Bay, especially in the morning. The bay serves as a place for them to rest and feed, and as a nursery for mothers and their calves. Due to the calm water conditions, extensive coral reef, and thriving underwater life, Kealakekua Bay offers some of the best snorkeling and diving in Hawaii, especially in the shallow waters adjacent to the monument. The bay is a protected marine environment so visitors can snorkel but no fishing is allowed in this area. About around the bay was designated a State Historic Park in 1967, and it was added as a Historic District to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as site 73000651. The of the bay itself were declared a Marine Life Conservation District in 1969. A narrow one-lane road to the south leads to Puuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historical Park, which contains more historic sites. In popular culture *Mark Twain's Roughing It mentions Kealakekua Bay and the killing of Captain Cook in Chapter 71. *In Arthur C. Clarke's book Rendezvous with Rama, Kealakekua Bay is mentioned as a place where Bill Norton, the Commander of the Space Survey Vessel Endeavour, visited. *The 1933 song \\"My Little Grass Shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii\\" mentions the state fish which can be found in the bay: the Humuhumunukunukuapuaa (Reef triggerfish).

Early life Buchanan was the son of a doctor from Coleford, Gloucestershire. He was educated at Monmouth School, where he was head boy. In 1913 he went to Jesus College, Oxford to study Classics. One of his tutors described him as \\"Thoroughly Scotch and rather reserved, but a hard worker & likely to be a good influence in the Coll[ege]\\". He rowed for the College in 1914, played rugby and was Secretary of the Athletics Club. He then joined the army, where he served in Gallipoli and Mesopotamia. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1916, and was mentioned four times in despatches. Award of the Victoria Cross Buchanan was 21 years old, and a temporary captain in the 4th Battalion, South Wales Borderers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on 5 April 1916 at Falauyah Lines, Mesopotamia, for which he was awarded the VC. The award was announced in a supplement to the London Gazette of 26 September 1916, and read: A newsreel film shows him being invested with the Victoria Cross and the Military Cross at a ceremony on Durdham Downs, Bristol, by King George V on 8 November 1917. In July 1916 he was also awarded the Russian decoration of the Order of St. Vladimir 4th Class (with Swords). Later life Buchanan was shot in the head in 1917 by a sniper and blinded. He returned to Jesus College after the war and read law, rowing for the college in 1919 despite his blindness. After graduating in 1921, he worked in a solicitor's office in Oxford before returning to Coleford to work until his death in 1944. He returned to Monmouth School in 1921 for the ceremony marking the dedication of the school's war memorial. Funds were raised in Coleford to mark his bravery, which he asked to be used to give children somewhere to play. He is buried in Coleford Cemetery, next to the recreation field named in his honour. His Victoria Cross was displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon but is now in the Lord Ashcroft VC Collection in The Imperial War Museum.

MRT is a concept arising from the fact that the net exchange of radiant energy between two objects is approximately proportional to their temperature difference multiplied by their ability to emit and absorb heat (emissivity). It is simply the area weighted mean temperature of all the objects surrounding the body. This is valid as long as the absolute temperatures of objects in question are large compared to the temperature differences, allowing linearization of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law in the relevant temperature range. MRT also has a strong influence on thermophysiological comfort indexes such as physiological equivalent temperature (PET) or predicted mean vote (PMV). What we experience and feel relating to thermal comfort in a building is related to the influence of both the air temperature and the temperature of surfaces in that space. The mean radiant temperature is expressed as this surface temperature and is controlled by enclosure performances. Maintaining a balance between the operative temperature and the mean radiant temperature can create a more comfortable space. This is done with effective design of the building, interior and with the use of high temperature radiant cooling and low temperature radiant heating.  Calculation  There are different ways to estimate the mean radiant temperature, either applying its definition and using equations to calculate it, or measuring it with particular thermometers or sensors. Since the amount of radiant heat lost or received by human body is the algebraic sum of all radiant fluxes exchanged by its exposed parts with the surrounding sources, MRT can be calculated from the measured temperature of surrounding walls and surfaces and their positions with respect to the person. Therefore, it is necessary to measure those temperatures and the angle factors between the person and the surrounding surfaces. Most building materials have a high emittance Œµ, so all surfaces in the room can be assumed to be black. Because the sum of the angle factors is unity, the fourth power of MRT equals the mean value of the surrounding surface temperatures to the fourth power, weighted by the respective angle factors. The following equation is used:2009 ASHRAE Handbook Fundamentals, ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA. MRT^4 = T_1^4 F_{p-1} + T_2^4 F_{p-2} + ... + T_n^4 F_{p-n} where: :MRT is Mean Radiant Temperature; :T_n is the temperature of surface \\"n\\", in Kelvins; :F_{p-n} is the angle factor between a person and surface \\"n\\". If relatively small temperature differences exist between the surfaces of the enclosure, the equation can be simplified to the following linear form: MRT = T_1 F_{p-1} + T_2 F_{p-2} + ... + T_n F_{p-n} This linear formula tends to give a lower value of MRT, but in many cases the difference is small. In general, angle factors are difficult to determine, and they normally depend on the position and orientation of the person. Furthermore, this method becomes complex and time consuming as the number of surfaces increases and they have elaborate shapes. There is currently no way to effectively collect this data. For this reason, an easier way to determine the MRT is by measuring it with a particular thermometer.  Measurement  The MRT can be estimated using a black-globe thermometer. The black-globe thermometer consists of a black globe in the center of which is placed a temperature sensor such as the bulb of a mercury thermometer, a thermocouple or a resistance probe. The globe can in theory have any diameter but as the formulae used in the calculation of the mean radiant temperature depend on the diameter of the globe, a diameter of , specified for use with these formulae, is generally recommended. The smaller the diameter of the globe, the greater the effect of the air temperature and air velocity, thus causing a reduction in the accuracy of the measurement of the mean radiant temperature. So that the external surface of the globe absorbs the radiation from the walls of the enclosure, the surface of the globe shall be darkened, either by the means of an electro-chemical coating or, more generally, by means of a layer of matte black paint. This thermometer actually measures the globe temperature (GT), tending towards thermal balance under the effect of convection and radiation coming from the different heat sources in the enclosure. Thanks to this principle, knowing GT allows the mean radiant temperature MRT to be determined. According to ISO 7726 Standard, the equation that is used most frequently (forced convection) is the following: MRT = left[ left(GT+273 right)^4 + frac{1.1 cdot 10^8 cdot v_a^{0.6}} {varepsilon cdot D^{0.4}}(GT - T_a) right]^{1/4} - 273 where: :MRT is the mean radiant temperature (¬∞C); :GT is the globe temperature (¬∞C); :v_a is the air velocity at the level of the globe (m/s); :varepsilon is the emissivity of the globe (no dimension); :D is the diameter of the globe (m); :T_a is air temperature (¬∞C); And for the standard globe (D = 0.15 m, varepsilon = 0.95): MRT = left[ left(GT+273 right)^4 + 2,5 cdot 10^8 cdot v_a^{0,6}(GT - T_a) right]^{1/4} - 273 The measurement is affected by air movement because the measured GT depends on both convection and radiation transfer. By effectively increasing the size of the thermometer bulb, the convection transfer coefficient is reduced and the effect of radiation is proportionally increased. Because of local convective air currents GT typically lies between the air temperature and MRT. The faster the air moves over the globe thermometer, the closer GT approaches the air temperature. Moreover, since the MRT is defined with respect to the human body, the shape of the sensor is also a factor. The spherical shape of the globe thermometer gives a reasonable approximation of a seated person; for people who are standing, the globe, in a radiant nonuniform environment, overestimates the radiation from floor or ceiling, so an ellipsoid sensor gives a better approximation. There are several other precautions to be taken when using a black-globe thermometer, depending on the conditions of the measurement. Furthermore, there are different measuring methods, such as the two-sphere radiometer and the constant-air-temperature sensor.

He received the VC during the First World War, for his actions during the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915. He was killed the following year at Thiepval. Early life The exact date of William Buckingham's birth is not known, but he was born in February 1886 in Bedford, England. He was the oldest child of William and Annie Billington. His father died in 1888, and his mother remarried in 1891, to Thomas Buckingham. A couple of years later, when William was six, he and his brother was placed in the Countesthorpe Cottage Homes, in Leicester, where he would spend most of his youth. Military career Buckingham joined the British Army in November 1901, when he was nearly 16, and was posted to the 2nd Battalion of The Leicestershire Regiment. With the regiment, he served on Guernsey and in British India. First World War A newspaper drawing of Buckingham On the outbreak of the First World War, Buckingham was still in India with the 2nd Battalion. It was attached to the 20th Indian Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division, and sent to the Western Front with the Indian Corps. He fought at the Defence of Givenchy, with his name being forwarded to Lieutenant General James Willcocks, the commander of the Indian Corps, for special mention. In March 1915, the Meerut Division was selected to be involved in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, which called for an assault on the German lines at Neuve Chapelle. The Meerut Division was to help force a gap for the Cavalry Corps to exploit. His battalion was on the right of the division's sector and proceeded to capture a section of German trenches that had been overlooked for a preliminary artillery barrage. Over the next two days, until relieved, the battalion resisted German counterattacks and artillery. During this time, Buckingham carried out several sorties to recover men who had been wounded. For his actions, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation reads as follows: Buckingham was wounded in the chest during the fighting, and was sent to England for recovery. He was unaware of the award of the VC until an acquaintance showed him a newspaper reporting it. King George V presented him with the VC on 4 June 1915, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. His caregivers from the Countesthorpe Cottage Homes were present for the investiture. It was later discovered that his mother was still alive, his stepfather having apparently abandoned the family many years previously. His hometown of Leicester took some pride in the award, gifting him ¬£100 in war loan stock and a purse of gold. Rather than immediately returning to his battalion, Buckingham was used in recruitment drives for the war effort. He remained in England until April 1916, at which time he was posted to the 1st Battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment. He was promoted to acting corporal for a time but requested a return to his previous rank of private. He was killed at Thiepval on 15 September 1916, during the later stages of the Battle of the Somme. He has no known grave and his name is recorded on the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme. Medals His medals, which in addition to the VC, included the 1914 Star, British War Medal, and the Victory Medal, were in the care of Countesthorpe Cottage Homes until 1958, at which time the facility was closed. They were then transferred to the care of the Child Welfare Department in Leicester. Since 1966, the medals have been displayed at the Royal Leicestershire Regiment Museum Collection in the Newarke Houses Museum, Leicester.

He was born in London and was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, then located in London.  Biography  Walter was engaged in a prosperous business as a coal merchant from the death of his father Richard Walter (about 1755/6) until 1781. Walter played a leading part in establishing the Coal Exchange in London; but shortly after 1781, when he began to occupy himself solely as an underwriter and became a member of Lloyd's, he over-speculated and failed. In 1782, he bought from one Henry Johnson a patent for a new method of printing from logotypes (i.e. founts of words or portions of words, instead of letters), and made some improvements to it. In 1784 he acquired an old printing office in Blackfriars, which formed the nucleus of the Printing-house Square of a later date, and established there his Logographic Office. At first Walter only undertook the printing of books, but on 1 January 1785 he started a small newspaper called The Daily Universal Register, which on reaching its 940th number on 1 January 1788 was renamed The Times. The printing business developed and prospered, but the newspaper at first had a somewhat chequered career. On 11 July 1789 Walter was convicted of libel on the Duke of York and was sentenced to a fine of ¬£50, a year's imprisonment in Newgate, to stand in the pillory for an hour and to give surety for good behaviour for seven years; for further libels the fine was increased by ¬£100 and the imprisonment by a second year. On 9 March 1791, however, he was freed and pardoned on the request of the Prince of Wales. In 1799 Walter was again convicted for a technical libel, this time on Lord Cowper. He had then given up the management of the business to his eldest son, William, and had (1795) retired to Teddington, where he lived till his death. In 1759 he had married Frances Landen (died 1798), by whom he had six children. William Walter very soon gave up the duties he undertook in 1795, and in 1803 transferred the sole management of the business to his son, John.

By the water lies a cabin called Tryvannstua, in which there is a caf√© open regularly during both summer and winter. On a hill above the lake looms the television tower Tryvannst√•rnet (\\"The Tryvann tower\\"), visible from most of Oslo. Tryvann is the entry and beginning of Nordmarka. It is used all year around. The key purposes of this area in the winter are skiing and cross-country skiing, whereas in the summer it is more commonly used for walks in the forest and biking. When referring to Tryvann, it is mostly referred to as the Tryvann vinterpark. Facts and infrastructure Tryvann vinterpark is an alpine ski resort in the area around Tryvann. The first ski slope of Tryvann vinterpark, named \\"Tryvannskleiva\\", was created in 1931. Since then an enormous expansion has occurred, and today Tryvann vinterpark consists of 18 slopes and 11 lifts. The longest run (Wyllerl√∏ypa) is 1,400 metres, with a drop of 381 metres. All the slopes have floodlighting which covers over 9.6 km of terrain. The resort has a fairly large terrain park featuring edge rails, boxes, jib features and a full-scale halfpipe, regularly hosting some minor national skiing and snowboarding competitions. Tryvann vinterpark is easily accessed by visitors with the metro system. The ride from Oslo city centre to the top of Tryvann takes approximately 25 minutes. This gives easy access and opportunities for over one million citizens in Oslo. Tryvann is Norway's fourth biggest ski resort in Norway, measured in ticket sales. In 2012 there were 205,000 visitors. History of Tryvannstua Tryvanstua was built in 1931. The cabin is constructed by windfall timber and was constructed unexpectedly after an immense storm in Nordmarka that occurred in November 1930. The storm damaged a radius close to 7000 m3, bringing down 3000 trees. As a result, Tryvannstua was constructed with the purpose of serving food for people travelling in the woods, and that was the beginning of Tryvann vinterpark. Tryvannstua was renovated and expanded in 1965‚Äì66. This increased the seating capacity to 175 people, and a fireplace was built for freezing alpinists. The renovation was an initiative mainly because of skiing in the 1966 World Cup.

It flows north for from its origin at the confluence of the Avondale Stream and Whau Stream to its mouth between the Te Atat≈´ peninsula and the long, thin Rosebank Peninsula in Avondale. It is at its widest and wide at its mouth. The estuary extends past the suburbs of Glendene and Kelston, between Auckland City to the east and Waitakere City to the west. It has one small estuarial tributary arm, the Wairau Creek in the southwest. The tide flows up the Wairau Creek as far as Sabulite Road in Kelston, and up the Rewarewa Creek to Clark Street and Wolverton Road in New Lynn. The area at the mouth of the estuary is legally protected as the Motu Manawa (Pollen Island) Marine Reserve. The Whau River is named after a native tree, the whau (Entelea arborescens). History In earlier times, Maori used the Whau for travel between the Waitemata Harbour (on the Pacific east coast) and the Manukau Harbour (on the Tasman west coast). They paddled canoes up the Whau River and the Avondale Stream and then carried the canoes over a short stretch of land to Green Bay on the Manukau. This is remembered in the name for Portage Road, which runs alongside the Avondale Stream, and it is known that seasonal Maori settlements existed at the mouth of the river. For many years after European settlement, there was talk of making a canal between the Whau and the Manukau. Plans for a long canal, with a cutting up to deep, were made in 1907, but dismissed as too costly in 1921. European settlers used the Whau for marine transport and by 1865 there were five public wharves at New Lynn. Boats carried the products of local industries including brickworks, a leather tannery, a gelatine and glue factory and firewood cutting. The last commercial vessel to use the Whau was a flat-bottomed scow the Rahiri, which carried bricks and manuka firewood from the area until 1948. For nearly a hundred years, factories such as the tannery and an abattoir discharged wastes directly into the Whau. Friends of the Whau Inc. was formed in 1999 to restore the ecology of the Whau through revegetation and reduction of pollution. The Whau River Catchment Trust was formed in 2012. The West End Rowing Club has been based on the Whau since 2001. In 2015 construction began on the Te Whau Pathway, a walking and cycling path along the western edge of the Whau River from Te Atat≈´ Peninsula to Olympic Park in New Lynn. The path is planned to continue on to Green Bay beach thus connecting the Waitemata Harbour to the Manukau Harbour.  Geography  The geology of the area is mainly composed of marine and riverine sediment. The stream's intertidal banks are commonly settled by mangroves and exotic weed species. The river's catchment covers and includes all or part of Te Atat≈´ South, Glendene, Kelston, Titirangi, Titirangi North, Green Bay, New Lynn, Glen Eden, Avondale, Blockhouse Bay and Mount Albert. Watersheds closely follow Te Atatu Road, Titirangi Road, Hillsborough Road, Richardson Road and Rosebank Road. The catchment consists of clay, sandstone and mud and was formed 20 million years ago when the land was raised from the sea.

He was the 115th recipient of the award and the first of 182 awarded during the Indian Mutiny (1358 have been awarded in total).  Early life  Buckley was born in a cottage on Cocker Hill in Stalybridge, Cheshire on 24 May 1813 and was baptised in Old St George's Church. He was destined to have a tragic family life though he himself thwarted death many times. His early employment was in the textile industry, working locally at Harrison's Mill and then Bayley's Mill. Recognising that his ambitions went beyond mill work, Buckley left home at Christmas 1831 to travel to Manchester, where he enlisted at the Recruiting Office into the Bengal Artillery. He joined the Regiment as a Gunner at Chatham and on 20 June 1832 he embarked on HMS Layton at Gravesend to join his unit in India. He married fourteen year old Mary Ann Broadway on 28 July 1835 at Chunar, India. He was then stationed at Fort William, Calcutta. By 1845 his wife and two of his three children had died of tropical disease. He then married Esther Hunter at Allahabad, India on 17 August 1846. In 1852 the surviving daughter from his first marriage died, and in the following year two sons by his second marriage also died. He was promoted Corporal on 31 August 1840, Sergeant on 1 September 1853, and being able to speak several Indian dialects he gained a position with the Bengal Veterans' Establishment as a Sub-Conductor on 21 April 1854. He was appointed Staff Conductor on 26 May 1856, and in 1857 he took his wife and three surviving children to Delhi, where he became Assistant Commissary of Ordnance and was employed at the Great Magazine, a storehouse for guns and ammunition.  Defence of the Magazine at Delhi  Buckley was 43 years old, and a Deputy Assistant Commissary of Ordnance in the Commissariat Department (Bengal Establishment) of the British East India Company during the Indian Mutiny when the following took place on 11 May 1857 at Delhi, India for which he was awarded the VC. Deputy Assistant Commissary Buckley was one of nine men who defended the ammunition storehouse for more than five hours against large numbers of mutineers. When the wall was being scaled and hope of outside help was gone, they blew up the ammunition, killing many of the mutineers. Of the defenders, five died in the explosion and one shortly afterwards, while Buckley, George Forrest, and William Raynor survived. His citation in the London Gazette reads:  Remaining life  He was captured by the enemy and soon learnt that his entire family had been ruthlessly murdered by the rebels. He had now lost two wives and eight children in total and wanted to live no longer. He begged for death from his captors but they refused to kill him on account of his bravery at the magazine. On escaping to the British lines he volunteered for every dangerous mission he could in order to vent his anger and seek revenge. He was present at the Battle of Badli-ki-Serai on 8 June 1857, and three attacks of sunstroke left him weak and ill, but he survived. He was then appointed Provost Marshal at Meerut, where one of his duties was to superintend the execution of 150 rebels. He devised their punishment of being strapped to the muzzle of a cannon and blown apart. Buckley was promoted to Lieutenant on 18 October 1858. He became ill again and the Medical Board at Fort William, Calcutta, granted him two years leave. He departed for Britain on 21 May 1858 and arrived home on 6 July. John Buckley was invested with his Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria on 2 August 1858 during a parade of the garrison on Southsea Common, Portsmouth. He returned to Stalybridge in September 1858, but soon left again for India. Buckley retired as a Major on 1 October 1861, returned to England and lived for may years with his final wife, Sara, at 213 East India Dock Road, Poplar until his death on 14 July 1876, aged 63. He was laid to rest at Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, Mile End in common ground. The medal Buckley has no direct descendants but a great- niece survived until 1955, at which time his VC was purchased by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps for ¬£11,000. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Royal Logistic Corps Museum at Camberley, Surrey, England. Commemorations A blue plaque to commemorate Buckley's life is sited at the Travellers Call public house in Stalybridge.Blue Plaque Buckley Barracks, home of 9 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps (formed from the amalgamation of the RAOC/RCT) at Hullavington, Wiltshire is named for him. Buckley House, the official residence of the commander of the Defence Storage and Distribution Centre at Bicester is also named after Buckley. His grave was left unmarked for 136 years until it was found by Doreen Kendall in 2012. Two years later the grave was marked with a headstone in a ceremony on 14 July 2014, which was attended by Jim Fitzpatrick MP, soldiers from 9 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps and the Victoria Cross Trust.

Classrooms are found in educational institutions of all kinds, ranging from preschools to universities, and may also be found in other places where education or training is provided, such as corporations and religious and humanitarian organizations. The classroom provides a space where learning can take place uninterrupted by outside distractions. Types of classroom In elementary schools (from Kindergarten through the 5th grade), classrooms can have a whole group of 18 to 30 students and one, two, or even three teachers. When there are two teachers in a classroom, one is the lead teacher and the other one is the associate. Or the second teacher might be a special education teacher. There may be a third teacher in the back watching and taking notes. In lower elementary the classrooms are set up slightly different than upper elementary. In these classrooms there are tables instead of desks, a rug with a (smart board) for whole group learning, a library, computers, and centers. The rug is the vocal point of the classroom and everything else is strategically placed around it. The teacher must be able to move swiftly through the classroom. To determine if the classroom is meeting the highest level of quality there is a grading scale called ECERS (Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale). There are 43 items on this checklist and it is divided into 7 categories and they are as follows: Space and Furnishings, Personal Care Routines, Language-Reasoning, Activities, Interactions, Program Structure, and Parents and Staff. In an upper elementary classroom students now use desks, there is no rug for whole group learning but there is a smart board and computers. Students also start practicing switching classes to get accustomed to middle and high, usually in fifth grade school transitions. In a self-contained classrooms there are 7 or less students. Self-contained classrooms are designed for children that need more one-on-one time. Teachers get to solely focus on their small group of students and create individualized lessons for each child. An integrated or inclusion classroom can be thought of as a mix between a traditional classroom and a self-contained classroom. In this style of classroom, there is a mix of general students and students that need services. There are two teachers in this style of classroom, a general education teacher and special education teacher. They both teach and serve the students in the classroom, but during certain parts of the day the special education teacher may pull the students that have services to give them additional support. This allows students with accommodations or an Individual Education Program (IEP), to still get to be in a general classroom but also get the individualized instruction they need. Middle school and high school classrooms are set up quite similar. There is one teacher and students transition from one classroom to the next. They do not stay in one classroom all day. These classrooms can have around 20 students. Students may not exactly have the same group of students in each class depending on the students schedule. Then college classrooms are set up in a lecture hall or auditorium with one teacher, also called a professor. Typically this teacher has a Teacher Assistant (TA), which is a grad student. This person may help administer or grade tests. They can also hold review sessions for college students to come to once or twice a week. Some other types of classrooms that a middle/high school or college might have are: computer labs for IT lessons, gymnasiums for sports, and science laboratories for biology, chemistry and physics. Decor and design The layout, design and decor of the classroom has a significant effect upon the quality of the educational experience. Attention to the acoustics and colour scheme may reduce distractions and aid concentration. The lighting and furniture likewise influence factors such as student attention span. Historically, relatively few pupil-centric design principles were used in the construction of classrooms. In 19th century Britain, one of the few common considerations was to try and orient new buildings so the class windows faced north as much as possible, while avoiding west or southern facing windows, as in Britain northern light causes less glare. Desks were often arranged in columns and rows, with a teacher's desk at the front, where he or she would stand and lecture the class. Little color was used for fear of distracting the children. In the 1950s and 60s cheap and harsh fluorescent lights were sometimes used, which could cause eyestrain. Research has suggested that optimal use of daylight, acoustics, color selection and even the arrangement of the furniture in the classroom can affect pupils academic success. Georgetown University found that test scores increased by 11% through the improvement of a classroom's physical environment. In the design of a classroom, desk arrangements are essential to the decor and design of the classroom followed by seating arrangements for the students. Usually classroom desks are arranged in rows or columns, but there are many more ways to arrange the desks, for example making a circle with the desks so that it's more of a group discussion or having the desks in a \\"U\\" shape for group discussions and easy access for the teacher. Another common principle is arrangement in 'clusters' or small groups, which usually improves interaction and participation in (small) group-processes. Color is also a big asset to the classroom by relating the colors to the subjects learned in the classroom to help the students learn. Also color helps the atmosphere be fun and exciting and help visual stimulation for the students. =Acoustics= The acoustics of the classroom are very often overlooked, but are an important part of the success of a child. Choosing only materials that cause sound to reverberate, such as tile floors and hard wall surfaces, greatly increases noise levels and can prove detrimental to learning. One study of hyperactive versus control groups of children found that white noise has no impact on either group, but that auditory stimulation such as distant conversations or music has a negative effect on both groups of students. Children with attention deficit disorder scored higher on tests when white noise was being pumped into the classroom than when music was played. The control group of children as well as the hyperactive group of children averaged the same test scores when there was no sound as when white noise was being played. By utilizing soft surfaces, especially on the floor, the sounds within and outside of the classroom will be diminished, taking away from the distractions facing students and improving not just the test scores of hyperactive children, but those without attention deficit disorder as well. Although carpet is an obvious choice for sound absorption, it may not be suitable for high traffic areas like hallways. In such cases, other sound absorbing materials, such as cork, can be used. The use of sound absorbing ceiling tiles may also be a wise choice for areas where carpet cannot be used for practical purposes. =Color selection= Color theory refers to the psychological effects color has on the human body. Red is said to increase both aggression and appetite, a poor combination for a school's interior. Yellow increases adrenaline levels and is also undesirable for a school setting. Blue, green, and brown create a relaxing and calming environment, which is a positive for the classroom. However, blue also is associated with cold and sadness and elongates the sense of time, which would make a blue classroom tortuous for students (Vodvarka, 1999). Warm colors are often favored by students, making them more alert and increasing brain activity, which helps in increasing test scores. Cool colors had the opposite effect. By balancing warm and cool colors, bright and subdued, a pleasing effect can be achieved that will reduce absenteeism in schools and keep the students focused on what the teacher is saying. Test scores go up when children are not in a stark white environment, which can feel sterile and cold. =Classroom arrangement = Redesigned classroom with moveable furniture at Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City Classroom arrangement or the arrangement of furniture is an important aspect because students spend most of their time seated in the classroom. The furniture should be able to move and easy to arrange to allow students to sit in places that are best suited for their learning styles so they can focus on work Traditionally, classrooms have had one setup: straight rows of desks facing the front of the classroom. The row style allows teachers ample amount of space to walk around. This makes it easier for teachers to supervise the students work and catch any students that may be misbehaving, insuring that students stay focused. Studies have found that the row style also fosters less off topic talking causing the atmosphere to be more conducive to learning. While the row style sounds ideal from a teacher's standpoint it can be damaging to the student's well being. The row style of desk arrangement has been found to cause the students to withdraw. An alternative to the traditional row style desk pavement is to arrange the desks in groups. Phil Beadle, a UK Secondary Teacher of the Year, believes that it is best to arrange the desks in groups of six desks if at all possible. This allows for the most use out of the desk arrangement as you have the ability to utilize groups of two, three, or six students without moving a single chair. Beadle isn't the only teacher to swear by group desk arrangement; studies have shown that the group desk placement setup produces a greater number of on task actions than any other form of desk placement. The group setup does have one potentially serious negative side effect. Students sitting in group desk placements are more likely to misbehave when the teacher isn't looking, like using iPads that are provided by the school, such as in the Cupertino Union School District. To avoid this the groups of desks should be arranged around the outside of the room giving the teacher plenty of room to walk around and supervise as well as providing room for kinesthetic activities that can be beneficial to the students learning. The final popular desk arrangement is the circle/semicircle placement. This particular desk setup is growing in popularity due to the numerous positive outcomes it provides. The circle desk arrangement facilitates the flow of ideas by fostering positive group dynamics. When sitting in a circle it is easier for students to not only see who is talking, but to make eye contact with the speaker. Students sitting in a circle arrangement tend to feel more comfortable speaking up and asking questions. This style of desk placement also makes it easier for teachers to control the class, preventing misbehaving and off task comments as it allows them to easily see all the students, and allows all the students to see the teacher. Besides, the type of furniture may play an important role in the learning space. There is a relationship between the ergonomic characteristics of the educational furniture and the number of cognitive errors, as the more ergonomics characteristics of the furniture, the less error. There is also an error percentage reduction using separated chair and desk.Jafari A, Arghami Sh, Kamali K, Zenozian S. Relationship Between Educational Furniture Design and Cognitive Error. In Congress of the International Ergonomics Association 2018 Aug 26 (pp. 649-656). Springer, Cham. Challenges to the classroom Maasai children in Tanzania. Online learning technologies make it possible for learning to take place at any time, at any place, and at any pace that the learner desires. This is particularly important for adult students who may need to schedule their learning around work and parenting responsibilities. According to the American Society for Training and Development, as of 2014, approximately 25% of employee training hours take place online rather than in a classroom. However, critics argue that even the classroom space is full of distractions in the 21st century since even though access to the online world may be restricted by some institutions, students may find distractions in their physical vicinity and so tend to multitask and divide their attention without focusing on any one task at a time. The traditional classroom has also been attacked by advocates of various forms of alternative education. Italian educator Maria Montessori wrote that \\"Stationary desks and chairs [are] proof that the principle of slavery still informs the school\\".

Life John Victor Lindsay Hopkins was born on 15 August 1937 in Slough, England. In 1958, Hopkins graduated from Cambridge University, which he had entered on a scholarship in 1955, with a degree in physics and mathematics, and began to work as a laboratory technician at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, Oxfordshire. When Hopkins took a trip to Moscow to attend a Communist youth festival, his security clearance was revoked. Hopkins then re-located to London at the beginning of 1960, and began to work as a photographer for newspapers and music magazines including Jazz News, The Guardian, Melody Maker and Peace News. Hopkins photographed many of the leading musicians of the period, including The Beatles and the Rolling Stones. He also recorded the seedier side of London, with photographs of tattoo parlours, caf√©s, prostitutes and fetishists. By the mid-1960s Hopkins was at the centre of London's emerging underground scene and recorded many peace marches, poetry readings and \\"happenings\\", as well as photographing leading counter-cultural figures including Allen Ginsberg and Malcolm X. He compiled and stencil- duplicated the names, contact details and interests of all of London's \\"movers and shakers\\". He then gave all of them a copy. This action is credited with greatly boosting the 1960s London-based underground movement. In 1966, with Rhaune Laslett and others, he helped set up the London Free School in Notting Hill. This in turn led to the establishment of the Notting Hill carnival, first organised by Laslett with the guidance of local activists including Michael X. As an extension of the Free School news-sheet The Gate in 1966 Hopkins and Barry Miles co-founded the influential magazine International Times (IT). Hopkins also set up the UFO Club with Joe Boyd, with Pink Floyd as the resident band.Sciortino, Karley, \\"John Hopkins Invented the 1960s\\", Vice, 2 March 2010. Arrested for cannabis possession, Hopkins elected for trial by jury. In court on 1 June 1967, Hopkins claimed that cannabis was harmless and that the law should be changed. The judge, describing him as \\"a pest to society\\",Green, Jonathon, All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counterculture. London: Jonathan Cape, 1998 (Pimlico edition, 1999, p. 181). sentenced Hopkins to nine months in prison for keeping premises for the smoking of cannabis and possession of cannabis, although he served only six months. A \\"Free Hoppy\\" movement sprang up and, as one particular consequence, Stephen Abrams began co-ordinating a campaign for the liberalisation of the law on cannabis. This led to the publication in The Times on 24 July of a full-page advertisement that described the existing law as \\"immoral in principle and unworkable in practice\\", signed by Francis Crick, George Melly, Jonathan Miller and the Beatles.Buchanan, Rose Troup (31 January 2015), \\"John 'Hoppy' Hopkins: Photographer of London's swinging sixties dies\\", The Independent. Paul McCartney, initially clandestinely, arranged the funding for this advertisement as a tribute to Hoppy, at the instigation of Barry Miles. Hopkins remained a member of IT‚Ä≤s editorial board and a major contributor, and founded BIT as an information and agitprop arm. Hopkins favoured the more anarchistic elements in the \\"underground\\" centred on Ladbroke Grove, such as former UFO doorman Mick Farren, who by 1967 was also working at the IT newspaper. In the 1970s Hopkins was involved in researching the social uses of video for UNESCO, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Home Office and others, and edited the Journal of the Centre for Advanced TV Studies. Later, he worked as a technical journalist in the video trade press, and co-authored distance learning video training courses. Subsequently, he took and exhibited macro photography of flowers and other plants, and co-authored papers on plant biochemistry at the University of Westminster. He also exhibited his photographs of events and personalities in the 1960s. He died at the age of 77 on 30 January 2015.\\"RIP John 'Hoppy' Hopkins\\", PinkFloydz.com. Retrieved 30 January 2015.

The payoffs are arranged so that if one passes the pot to one's opponent and the opponent takes the pot on the next round, one receives slightly less than if one had taken the pot on this round. Although the traditional centipede game had a limit of 100 rounds (hence the name), any game with this structure but a different number of rounds is called a centipede game. The unique subgame perfect equilibrium (and every Nash equilibrium) of these games indicates that the first player take the pot on the first round of the game; however, in empirical tests, relatively few players do so, and as a result, achieve a higher payoff than the payoff predicted by the equilibria analysis. These results are taken to show that subgame perfect equilibria and Nash equilibria fail to predict human play in some circumstances. The Centipede game is commonly used in introductory game theory courses and texts to highlight the concept of backward induction and the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, which show a standard way of providing a solution to the game. Play One possible version of a centipede game could be played as follows: The addition of coins is taken to be an externality, as it is not contributed by either player. = Formal Definition = The centipede game may be written as mathcal{G}(N,~m_{0},~m_{1}) where N, m_{0}, m_{1}inmathbb{N} and m_{0}>m_{1}. Players I and II alternate, starting with player I, and may on each turn play a move from {mathrm{take},mathrm{push}} with a maximum of N rounds. The game terminates when mathrm{take} is played for the first time, otherwise upon N moves, if mathrm{take} is never played. Suppose the game ends on round tin{0,ldots,N-1}with player pin{I,II}making the final move. Then the outcome of the game is defined as follows: * If p played mathrm{take}, then p gains 2^{t}m_{0} coins and p^{ast} gains 2^{t}m_{1}. * If p played mathrm{push}, then p gains 2^{t+1}m_{1} coins and p^{ast} gains 2^{t+1}m_{0}. Here, p^{ast}in{I,II}denotes the other player. Equilibrium analysis and backward induction Extensive Form representation of a four-stage centipede game, which ends after four rounds with the money being split. Passing the coins across the table is represented by a move of R (going across the row of the lattice, sometimes also represented by A for across) and pocketing the coins is a move D (down the lattice). The numbers 1 and 2 along the top of the diagram show the alternating decision-maker between two players denoted here as 1 and 2, and the numbers at the bottom of each branch show the payoff for players 1 and 2 respectively. Standard game theoretic tools predict that the first player will defect on the first round, taking the pile of coins for himself. In the centipede game, a pure strategy consists of a set of actions (one for each choice point in the game, even though some of these choice points may never be reached) and a mixed strategy is a probability distribution over the possible pure strategies. There are several pure strategy Nash equilibria of the centipede game and infinitely many mixed strategy Nash equilibria. However, there is only one subgame perfect equilibrium (a popular refinement to the Nash equilibrium concept). In the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, each player chooses to defect at every opportunity. This, of course, means defection at the first stage. In the Nash equilibria, however, the actions that would be taken after the initial choice opportunities (even though they are never reached since the first player defects immediately) may be cooperative. Defection by the first player is the unique subgame perfect equilibrium and required by any Nash equilibrium, it can be established by backward induction. Suppose two players reach the final round of the game; the second player will do better by defecting and taking a slightly larger share of the pot. Since we suppose the second player will defect, the first player does better by defecting in the second to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than she would have received by allowing the second player to defect in the last round. But knowing this, the second player ought to defect in the third to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than he would have received by allowing the first player to defect in the second to last round. This reasoning proceeds backwards through the game tree until one concludes that the best action is for the first player to defect in the first round. The same reasoning can apply to any node in the game tree. For a game that ends after four rounds, this reasoning proceeds as follows. If we were to reach the last round of the game, Player 2 would do better by choosing d instead of r, receiving 4 coins instead of 3. However, given that 2 will choose d, 1 should choose D in the second to last round, receiving 3 instead of 2. Given that 1 would choose D in the second to last round, 2 should choose d in the third to last round, receiving 2 instead of 1. But given this, Player 1 should choose D in the first round, receiving 1 instead of 0. There are a large number of Nash equilibria in a centipede game, but in each, the first player defects on the first round and the second player defects in the next round frequently enough to dissuade the first player from passing. Being in a Nash equilibrium does not require that strategies be rational at every point in the game as in the subgame perfect equilibrium. This means that strategies that are cooperative in the never-reached later rounds of the game could still be in a Nash equilibrium. In the example above, one Nash equilibrium is for both players to defect on each round (even in the later rounds that are never reached). Another Nash equilibrium is for player 1 to defect on the first round, but pass on the third round and for player 2 to defect at any opportunity. Empirical results Several studies have demonstrated that the Nash equilibrium (and likewise, subgame perfect equilibrium) play is rarely observed. Instead, subjects regularly show partial cooperation, playing \\"R\\" (or \\"r\\") for several moves before eventually choosing \\"D\\" (or \\"d\\"). It is also rare for subjects to cooperate through the whole game. For examples see McKelvey and Palfrey (1992) and Nagel and Tang (1998). As in many other game theoretic experiments, scholars have investigated the effect of increasing the stakes. As with other games, for instance the ultimatum game, as the stakes increase the play approaches (but does not reach) Nash equilibrium play. =Explanations= Since the empirical studies have produced results that are inconsistent with the traditional equilibrium analysis, several explanations of this behavior have been offered. Rosenthal (1981) suggested that if one has reason to believe his opponent will deviate from Nash behavior, then it may be advantageous to not defect on the first round. One reason to suppose that people may deviate from the equilibrium behavior is if some are altruistic. The basic idea is that if you are playing against an altruist, that person will always cooperate, and hence, to maximize your payoff you should defect on the last round rather than the first. If enough people are altruists, sacrificing the payoff of first-round defection is worth the price in order to determine whether or not your opponent is an altruist. Nagel and Tang (1998) suggest this explanation. Another possibility involves error. If there is a significant possibility of error in action, perhaps because your opponent has not reasoned completely through the backward induction, it may be advantageous (and rational) to cooperate in the initial rounds. However, Parco, Rapoport and Stein (2002) illustrated that the level of financial incentives can have a profound effect on the outcome in a three- player game: the larger the incentives are for deviation, the greater propensity for learning behavior in a repeated single-play experimental design to move toward the Nash equilibrium. Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2009) find that expert chess players play differently from college students. With a rising Elo, the probability of continuing the game declines; all Grandmasters in the experiment stopped at their first chance. They conclude that chess players are familiar with using backward induction reasoning and hence need less learning to reach the equilibrium. However, in an attempt to replicate these findings, Levitt, List, and Sadoff (2010) find strongly contradictory results, with zero of sixteen Grandmasters stopping the game at the first node. Significance Like the Prisoner's Dilemma, this game presents a conflict between self-interest and mutual benefit. If it could be enforced, both players would prefer that they both cooperate throughout the entire game. However, a player's self-interest or players' distrust can interfere and create a situation where both do worse than if they had blindly cooperated. Although the Prisoner's Dilemma has received substantial attention for this fact, the Centipede Game has received relatively less. Additionally, Binmore (2005) has argued that some real-world situations can be described by the Centipede game. One example he presents is the exchange of goods between parties that distrust each other. Another example Binmore (2005) likens to the Centipede game is the mating behavior of a hermaphroditic sea bass which takes turns exchanging eggs to fertilize. In these cases, we find cooperation to be abundant. Since the payoffs for some amount of cooperation in the Centipede game are so much larger than immediate defection, the \\"rational\\" solutions given by backward induction can seem paradoxical. This, coupled with the fact that experimental subjects regularly cooperate in the Centipede game, has prompted debate over the usefulness of the idealizations involved in the backward induction solutions, see Aumann (1995, 1996) and Binmore (1996).

He was the son of John Walter, the founder of The Times, and succeeded his father as the newspaper's second editor. Biography Walter was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and Trinity College, Oxford. About 1798 he was associated with his elder brother in the management of his father's business, and in 1803 became not only sole manager, but also editor of The Times. Walter expressed his opposition to the administration of William Pitt the Younger, which cost him government advertisements and the loss of his appointment as printer to the Customs. It also brought the hostility of officials. When the King of Portugal sent him, via the Portuguese ambassador, a service of gold plate, he returned it. Walter insisted on the anonymity of those whom he hired. From about 1810, he delegated to others editorial supervision, first to Sir John Stoddart, then to Thomas Barnes, and in 1841 to John Thadeus Delane, though never the ultimate direction of policy. In 1830, Walter purchased an estate called Bearwood at Sindlesham in Berkshire where he built a house, afterwards rebuilt by his son. He was appointed High Sheriff of Berkshire the same year. Two years later, he was elected to Parliament for the county, and retained his seat till 1837, as a member of the Whigs. In 1841 he was returned to Parliament for Nottingham, but was unseated the following year on petition. He was twice married, and by his second wife, Mary Smythe, had a family. His eldest son, John, also worked in the newspaper. He died in London on 28 July 1847. The Walter Fountain was erected in Nottingham by his son in 1866 in his memory.

It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform aerobatic maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcov√°k and Immelmann turn. Flight Unlimited was the first self-published game released by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life. Flight Unlimited received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success; its sales exceeded 780,000 copies by 2002. Reviewers lauded its realism, flight instruction, graphics and sense of flight, but some criticized its high system requirements. The game was followed by two sequels: Flight Unlimited II (1997) and Flight Unlimited III (1999). A combat-oriented successor, Flight Combat, was released in 2002 as Jane's Attack Squadron after a series of setbacks. Soon after Flight Unlimiteds completion, Blackley was fired from Looking Glass. He went on to design Jurassic Park: Trespasser at DreamWorks Interactive and later spearhead the Xbox project at Microsoft. Gameplay Sugarloaf, Maine. The flight instruments, which show real-time information about the plane, are displayed on the bottom half of the screen. Flight Unlimited is a three-dimensional (3D) flight simulator video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world airplanes. Players may control the Bellanca Decathlon, Extra 300S, Pitts Special S-2B, Sukhoi Su-31 and Grob G103a Twin II sailplane. The game begins at the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface‚Äîa traversable 3D room whose contents represent menu options. For example, the player interacts with a row of scale airplane models to select an aircraft, and with a world globe to change airfield locations. Six settings are available, including Sedona, Arizona and Springfield, Vermont. The player may choose to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are controlled via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera in front of the plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three- Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point. The game contains lessons that cover basic and advanced flight techniques, ranging from rudder turns to challenging aerobatic maneuvers. A simulated flight instructor offers real-time advice based on the player's performance. Certificates are earned by performing well during lessons. In Hoops courses, the player undertakes a time trial through rings that float in the sky, with the option to enable a \\"ghost plane\\" of the highest score. Four types of Hoops courses are available: Basic, Challenge, Distance and Trick. The last is intended as a highly demanding test of the player's aerobatic ability. The game's sole non-powered aircraft, the Grob G103a Twin II sailplane, features its own game mode focused on energy management. The player attempts to use the direction of the wind, thermals‚Äîwhich realistically occur above areas that absorb more heat, such as plains and parking lots‚Äîand the orographic lift caused by slopes to stay airborne for as long as possible. Development =Origin= Seamus Blackley was instrumental in the development of Flight Unlimited. The concept of Flight Unlimited originated from Looking Glass Technologies' discontent with contemporary flight simulators. Company co-founders Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner wanted to develop an exceptional game in the genre, and Neurath considered the idea during the production of Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds. In 1992, Seamus Blackley, who had been undertaking graduate studies in particle physics at the Fermilab research facility, was hired through a want advertisement that Lerner had placed on a bulletin board. At the company, Blackley programmed the physics modeling system for a racing game and designed a large number of standalone physics demonstrations. He became fascinated by physics programming. An amateur pilot and flight devotee, Blackley asked Lerner extensive questions about his earlier game Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer, which Blackley held in high regard. In reaction to Blackley's enthusiasm, Neurath suggested that the company develop a \\"traditional Cessna sim\\". However, Blackley instead proposed an aerobatics training simulation, which he had conceived while reading an aerobatics magazine on a Lexington, Massachusetts bus. Collaborating with Ultima Underworld II programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the \\"yummy, visceral, fluid feeling that you get when flying a real airplane\\". He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a playground than to a video game, and he sought to give it simple controls and realistic terrain to decrease the learning curve for beginners. Blackley assumed the role of project leader and then engaged the team in \\"flaming sessions\\" to generate ideas. According to programmer Doug Church, Blackley's concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March. =Production= Blackley's first objective was to code the game's simulated physics. He began by deciding on a programming method‚Äîin particular, he sought one that would allow aircraft to perform the \\"knife-edge spin\\" maneuver that he had witnessed at air shows. In 1995, he said that he had never played a flight simulator with an accurate sense of flight. He later described his belief that the genre had stagnated, and that flight games were evaluated \\"by [their] implementation of the standard feature set\\", rather than by their enjoyability. Blackley researched physics programming in contemporary flight simulators, and he discovered that many used large databases of wind tunnel and plane sensory equipment information to dictate how aircraft would operate in prerecorded scenarios. Higher-end simulators used a \\"Newtonian\\" system, in which algebra-based measurements of force vectors determine a plane's position in real-time. However, Blackley believed that neither system correctly simulated the experience of flight. In reaction, he used his knowledge of particle physics to create a real-time computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) model for Flight Unlimited. The result is a simulated atmosphere: air acts as a fluid that automatically reacts to the shape of any object placed within it. Blackley gave the example that a lawn chair, if placed within the game's real- time CFDs model, would fall merely because of its shape. The game's planes fly because the interaction of their architecture with the atmosphere creates lift, as with real-world aircraft. Changes in the plane's direction are caused by the interaction of their flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators and rudders) with the simulated atmosphere. Because it simulates the dynamics of flight in real-time, the system allows for aerobatic maneuvers that were impossible in previous flight simulators. In 1994, Blackley said that it was possibly the first flight code designed for aerobatics. In constructing the CFDs model, Blackley and the team built from the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations of fluid motion, which Blackley described as \\"horrible, complicated partial differential equations\\". According to Computer Gaming World, Blackley did not seek to represent the equations with perfect accuracy, and he was satisfied when the results were consistent and the sensation that they generated was correct. After programming a basic version of the CFDs model, Blackley used several programs to examine the simulated currents of air that flowed across a model of a flat plate. He adjusted the code until the plate fell realistically, and then constructed test models for a plane wing and fuselage. He eventually built a complete but dysfunctional plane by using data from \\"pinhead books\\". By reading aircraft design manuals, he discovered that the problems were caused by his plane's incorrect tail and center of gravity. Following this, he created an exact three-dimensional model of the Extra 300S over roughly three days. As he had not yet simulated the physical attributes of its propeller, Blackley programmed the plane to be propelled from the rear. However, the accurate model performed properly in the simulated atmosphere. Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played critical roles in the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit‚Äîformer bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe‚Äîvisited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game. The flight instructor was designed to respond to the player's performance. If a mistake is made during a maneuver‚Äîsuch as the Immelmann turn demonstrated above‚Äîguidance is provided in real-time. The flight instructor was created by programmer Andrew Grant and voiced by Tom Streit. It monitors the player's controller input during \\"each frame of animation\\". If a maneuver is attempted, the instructor \\"interpolates the initial control movements\\" and predicts which maneuver is being performed. The instructor then gives advice on how to complete the maneuver and offers guidance if a mistake is made. Grant believed that the code is sometimes \\"too picky\\", and he stated that it expects players to perform maneuvers more precisely than is humanly possible. The team initially planned to include an online multiplayer component, which would have allowed 64 planes to fly in the same area‚Äîthereby giving players the ability to compete with one another. However, the feature was not implemented into the final game. The staff members also sought to include aerobatic competitions in which the player could participate, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties with realism. Problems with artificially intelligent judges were also a factor in the feature's removal. Flight Unlimiteds terrain graphics were created with stereophotogrammetry. The team gathered aerial photographs from locations in France and the United States. They combined two to three images of each area to create digital reproductions roughly in size. Each location in the game was based on two stereoscopic sets of photographs, which were processed for more than 72 hours by a \\"dedicated Pentium tucked away in a dark corner\\". From the contrasting images, the computer generated a terrain \\"data blanket\\" with 3D height variations. While the team had considered using satellite or surveillance aircraft images to create the game's terrain graphics, they found that the resolution was inadequate. Material from geographic information systems was also studied, but associate producer Paul Schaffer said that it would have been \\"astronomically expensive\\" to obtain data with the necessary resolution. After assembling a playable demo of Flight Unlimited, the team requested assistance from then-US Aerobatic Team member Michael Goulian, who worked as a flight instructor at the nearby Hanscom Field. Because of the game's flight code, Goulian was able to execute aerobatic maneuvers within less than three minutes of playing the game; and he later performed his \\"entire basic aerobatic routine\\". Blackley told PC Gamer US that, while Goulian disliked flight simulators, \\"When he flew Flight Unlimited, he just said 'pretty cool.' I was so psyched\\". Goulian assisted the team during the next year of development: he co-designed the game's flight lessons and advised the team on adjustments to the plane models. Aerobatic pilot Patty Wagstaff was also consulted. At one point, the team encountered problems while testing a maneuver in the game's Sukhoi Su-31, and Blackley was concerned that he would need to rework the game's physics code. However, Goulian phoned a colleague‚Äîa Russian pilot‚Äîwho told them to compensate for the plane's abnormally large ailerons. Using his advice on flying the real-world plane, the team found that the maneuver worked correctly. Goulian endorsed Flight Unlimited and wrote the foreword to its official strategy guide. The graphics and physics code increased the game's system requirements, and the team worked to optimize performance during development. They struggled to improve the game's memory usage: the process consumed nearly as much time as the creation of the physics model, according to Church. Programmer Eric Twietmeyer ran weekly tests of the game's performance by disabling certain parts of the code‚Äîsuch as the physics calculations‚Äîto isolate which parts used the most memory. By 1994, Blackley's physics code took up only 1% of CPU time, with the rest allocated to the terrain renderer. Blackley optimized his code by converting the mathematical calculations of air from the 3D game world into a \\"math-friendly space\\", during which time the Navier-Stokes equations are applied. Afterwards, the data is returned to 3D space. According to Computer Gaming World, this method increased speed by \\"a factor of 100, with almost no loss in precision.\\" The team had trouble with complex memory-related glitches during development. Church called them \\"crazy\\", and programmer Greg Travis noted that debugging the terrain cache system was a \\"nightmare\\". While leading the team, Blackley adopted a loose style of supervision. According to Opening the Xbox author Dean Takahashi, \\"Blackley [was not] ultra-organized. His idea of good management was to invite someone over for a gourmet dinner and have a casual conversation about work\\". However, Takahashi wrote that \\"Blackley worked hard to inspire his team\\", and he described artist James Dollar's belief that, \\"in contrast to other Looking Glass managers, he didn't take over tasks and make others feel stupid\\". During the first two years of production, the team was divided into small groups that worked on the game's elements separately. For example, Blackley programmed the game's physics, while Eric Twietmeyer and Tim Day created the terrain renderer. However, Doug Church later said that, while \\"the team [did] a bunch of very cool stuff, the FBO, the flight model, the instructor, the renderer, so on\\", the result \\"was almost like four separate programs, with no connection\\". Following the completion of the concurrently-developed System Shock, a significant part of that game's team‚Äîincluding Church, Marc LeBlanc and Rob Fermier‚Äîmoved to Flight Unlimited to add connective material. At the time, Church said that it was difficult to meld the game's elements, but he later stated that they largely coalesced by the end. =Publication= Flight Unlimited was self-published by Looking Glass Technologies. Their previous games had been developed for other video game publishers, and had generated $90 million total earnings for those companies. However, Ronald Rosenberg of The Boston Globe reported that Looking Glass was \\"no longer satisfied as a backroom player surviving on royalties\\". Doug Church later explained that the company wanted to self-publish in order to escape the \\"treadmill of waiting for advances\\", which would allow them to make long-term plans without needing to satisfy the immediate demands of a publisher. In late 1994, Looking Glass announced that venture capital investors, including Matrix Partners and Institutional Venture Partners, had provided the company with $3.8 million. The sum was intended to fund the development and self-publication of Flight Unlimited. According to Michael Humphreys of Matrix Partners and Ruthann Quindlen of Institutional Venture Partners, the decision was partly influenced by the past success of the company's co-founders, Paul Neurath and Ned Lerner. Looking Glass intended Flight Unlimited as a gateway into the video game publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of Flight Unlimited would increase royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return before the end of the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of employees would increase from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told The Boston Globe that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for Flight Unlimited to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed System Shock, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management. Flight Unlimited was placed in direct competition with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of Next Generation Magazine wrote, \\"1995 is going to be a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft Flight Simulator and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's Falcon 4.0, among others.\\" Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote, \\"The games that sell big are the ones that allow you to blow stuff up, so, if anything, that could be a problem for Flight Unlimited.\\" Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to Microsoft Flight Simulator, the team spent \\"many late nights\\" on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called \\"a really good sign\\". Talking to Bernie Yee of PC Gamer US, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath \\"fully [expected] it to prove more popular than Microsoft Flight Simulator\\". In January 1995, Looking Glass showed Flight Unlimited alongside Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show, under their \\"Immersive Reality\\" marketing label. In March 1995, the Boston Globe reported that the team was performing \\"11th hour checks\\" of the game to prepare it for shipment to a Midwestern United States Compact Disc manufacturer. According to the newspaper, Looking Glass planned to begin by shipping 100,000 units to retailers in Canada and the United States. Another 100,000 copies were to be sent to France, Germany and the United Kingdom at a later date. However, upon the game's June 7, 1995 release for MS-DOS, 200,000 units were distributed simultaneously in the United States and Europe. The game's European releases were localized with German, French and English text and voice acting, which was made possible by \\"close coordination with international partners\\". Versions for Macintosh and Windows 95 were later released; the former was shown at the Macworld Expo in April 1996. Reception Flight Unlimited was a commercial success. It debuted in twelfth place on a June 1995 sales chart compiled by NPD Group, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1 took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the Boston Herald, Flight Unlimited successfully competed with Microsoft Flight Simulator. PC Gamers Lee Buchanan wrote that it \\"soars above the pack of flight simulations\\", and he considered it to be \\"the most fun [he had] had in a computerized cockpit\\". Frank Vizard of Popular Mechanics hailed it as \\"the new top gun of flight simulators\\", and Doug Bailey of The Boston Globe considered it to be the \\"first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre\\". The Records David Noack believed that the game's physics and stereoscopic terrain set \\"a new standard in flight simulation\\". Writing for Computer Gaming World, Bob and John Nolan stated, \\"If anything, you should at least take a look at this product, because you'll be looking at the future of simulations.\\" The game was a finalist in the 12th Annual Awards for Technical Excellence held by PC Magazine, whose staff called it \\"the simulator by which all others will be judged.\\" It was named the best simulation of 1995 by Computer Games Strategy Plus (tied with Apache), and the best of 1996 by Macworld, whose editor Steven Levy wrote that it \\"puts you in touch with what makes flying special.\\" Inside Mac Games and PC Gamer both nominated Flight Unlimited as the simulation of the year, although it lost these awards to A-10 Cuba! and Apache, respectively. =Design= Vizard stated that Flight Unlimiteds \\"very advanced computational fluid dynamics make [each] plane react according to spec\\". Buchanan lauded the fluid model for creating a \\"sensation of actual flight [that] is nothing short of magnificent\\", while PC Magazines staff commented that it makes \\"planes behave more like real aircraft than any simulator we have seen\\". Bob and John Nolan called the game's physics programming \\"groundbreaking\\", and Chris Ware of the Lexington Herald-Leader found the game to be the most accurate simulation of flight beyond \\"those multimillion-dollar flight simulators [used by] fighter pilots and astronauts\\". Noack agreed: he wrote that the game \\"is about as close to flying within going to the airport\\". In 1996, Computer Gaming World presented Flight Unlimited with a Special Artistic Achievement Award For Physical Model. The magazine's staff praised Blackley's programming for pushing the genre \\"higher into the realm of simulation\\", and listed the game's sophisticated physics model as #5 on its list of \\"the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming\\". Ware found Flight Unlimited approachable and noted its \\"simplicity of use and depth of instruction\\". Buchanan hailed the lesson mode as \\"a dream come true for any budding pilot\\". A writer for The Washington Post called the game \\"[the] world's first truly easy-to-use flight simulator\\" and \\"a good entry product\\", in which \\"rank amateurs can just launch the program and start cruising immediately\\". The Washington Posts John Gaudiosi wrote that, while many games in the genre are overly complex, Flight Unlimited lets \\"those who aren't rocket scientists ... experience the thrills of stunt flying.\\" He found its control scheme simple to understand. By contrast, Bailey found the game difficult and initially \\"frustrating\\": he complained that he had to play the lesson mode before even taking off. Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World characterized the game's learning curve as steep, thanks to the accuracy of the physics programming, but he noted the scalable difficulty options. Bailey later recommended the game in a holiday shopping guide. He wrote that \\"it can be difficult to master. But once you're up, it's worth the trouble.\\" A writer for The Washington Post commented that \\"serious flight freaks will like the racing and advanced maneuvers\\". According to Gaudiosi, dedicated players will learn \\"all about aerodynamics and stunt flying\\"; he considered the latter to be \\"hard stuff, even with green hoops guiding you\\". Similarly, Buchanan characterized the Hoops courses as \\"incredibly demanding\\", and Atkin cited that mode's Trick difficulty level as \\"amazingly tough\\". Bob and John Nolan wrote that people who \\"love to loop around the skies of Flight Simulator 5 will go bananas for\\" the aerobatics; but the pair commented that combat flight simulator players \\"might get a little edgy once the wow-power wears off.\\" However, Atkin believed that only those \\"never happy without something to shoot at\\" could be disappointed by the lack of combat: other players will \\"be too busy choreographing aerial ballets, pulling off death-defying aerobatic stunts, or just enjoying a quiet soar down the ridge line to miss that stuff\\". Likewise, Ware called the non-violent gameplay \\"refreshing\\", and Buchanan wrote, \\"If [you are] a battle-weary veteran of air combat sims, Flight Unlimited might be just the sort of [rest and relaxation] you need.\\" =Presentation= Atkin found the cockpit and terrain graphics to look \\"almost real\\". He commented, \\"Every few years a sim comes along that lets reviewers use the 'sets new standards for graphics' clich√©, and Flight Unlimited is the 1995 entry in this club.\\" Bob and John Nolan called Flight Unlimited \\"the ultimate show off piece for your new Pentium\\", thanks to \\"unbelievable\\" graphics superior to those of any other computer game. Gaudiosi concurred: he characterized the visuals as \\"photo-sharp\\" and \\"better than any I have seen\\". PC Magazines staff found the graphics \\"impressive\\" and \\"even more stunning than those in Microsoft Flight Simulator\\". Ware noted the \\"stunning 3-D photo-realistic scenery\\", while Bailey stated that the \\"graphics are brilliantly rendered and whiz by smoothly\\". Buchanan called Flight Unlimiteds terrain \\"just superb\\" and Vizard described it as \\"amazingly real\\". Buchanan believed that \\"what you hear in Flight Unlimited is every bit as good as what you see\\", thanks to \\"utterly convincing\\" sound effects. Atkin praised the instructor as \\"one of the best uses of voice ever in a multimedia title\\". Bailey wrote that the game needs \\"a real beefy machine\\" to run properly; Atkin stated that the \\"massive horsepower requirement will restrict many gamers to lower resolutions and detail levels\\". Bob and John Nolan similarly found that the game \\"hogs computing power\\". Buchanan wrote that the system requirements listed on the back of the game's box \\"must be a joke\\", and that a high- performance computer is necessary to run the game. In 1996, PC Gamer US presented the game with a \\"Special Achievement in Graphics\\" award. The editors wrote, \\"While it requires the most sophisticated computer hardware on the market to be enjoyed, Flight Unlimited rewards gamers with some of the most stunning scenery ever seen in a flight sim.\\" Aftermath Flight Unlimited was the first of three self-published titles released by Looking Glass Technologies. However, the next two products, Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri (1996) and British Open Championship Golf (1997), were commercial failures. As a result, the company ceased self-publishing and was left in dire financial circumstances. Doug Church later explained that Looking Glass' attempt to publish came at a difficult time for the video game industry: \\"the other mid-sized publishers were mostly going out of business or getting bought\\". He believed that the company had been \\"overreaching itself\\" with the venture, and that it was \\"being a little overambitious and a little cocky\\". =Sequels= Flight Unlimited was intended to be followed by a combat- oriented sequel, which was developed under the working title Flight Combat. In 1995, Seamus Blackley told PC Gamer US that he wanted the game to \\"feel so real that pilots will be afraid. They'll feel the gun hits.\\" Talking to Computer Gaming World, he stated that the game would teach players the \\"same curriculum [as] the Air Force\\", and that it would feature competitive online play. However, a company manager, newly instated by venture capital investors who disliked Looking Glass' management style, instead demanded that Blackley create a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. The two argued regularly, and Blackley later accused the manager of \\"ripp[ing] the guts out of Looking Glass\\". In response to Blackley's refusal to create Flight Unlimited II, the manager fired him. Blackley left the company in late 1995 with designer Austin Grossman, and both were hired by DreamWorks Interactive to create Jurassic Park: Trespasser. He later spearheaded development of the Xbox at Microsoft. Constantine Hantzopoulos directed Flight Unlimited II, which was published by Eidos Interactive in 1997. The team could not continue using the real-time computational fluid dynamics of Flight Unlimited because, according to Hantzopoulos, it was \\"all black box spaghetti code from Seamus\\". The aerobatics focus of its predecessor was dropped in favor of general civilian aviation. The development of Flight Combat was hinted at during the production of Flight Unlimited II. A third game, Flight Unlimited III, was published by Electronic Arts in 1999; and it continued the focus on general aviation. That year, Flight Combat was officially announced as the World War II-themed, Electronic Arts-published Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe, but its name was eventually changed to Jane's Attack Squadron. The game was canceled as a consequence of Looking Glass Studios' closure in 2000. However, it was later finished by developer Mad Doc Software and released in 2002 by publisher Xicat Interactive.

It then crosses the Niagara River, where it encounters the international border with the United States and continues into New York as Interstate 190 (I-190). Designated and under construction by 1960, the short freeway was opened to traffic on September 11, 1963. Since that time, an interchange was added in 1969 and another removed in 2004. On August 13, 2006, Highway 405 was dedicated the General Brock Parkway. The entire length of Highway 405 is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP).  Route description  Highway 405 serves to connect the northern end of I-190 in New York at the Lewiston‚ÄìQueenston Bridge with the QEW, and therefore it follows a somewhat direct path between the two. Throughout its length, the highway gently climbs the Niagara Escarpment, reaching the top east of Stanley Avenue before crossing the Niagara Gorge. The highway is surrounded by forest to either side for most of its length, and the only settlement near it is the village of Queenston. Highway 405 begins by diverging from the QEW at St. Catharines. It continues north-east for , then gently curves south-easterly. The opposing lanes, initially separated by a wide gap, converge towards each other to form a grass median. The highway dips into a shallow gully, widens to five lanes (three eastbound, two westbound), and then curves northeast to pass north of a hydroelectric reservoir. The opposing lanes converge, with an Ontario Tall Wall separating them, and pass beneath Niagara Regional Road 102 (Stanley Avenue). The freeway's lone interchange is with Stanley Avenue, and traffic continuing east must cross the Lewiston‚ÄìQueenston Bridge into the United States. The additional eastbound lane provided along this section is for the queueing of trucks. After passing the reservoir, the highway reaches the Canada Border Services plaza. It then passes over the Niagara Parkway and heads onto the Lewiston‚ÄìQueenston Bridge over the Niagara River. The Highway 405 designation ends at the border with the United States, where it continues as I-190 towards Buffalo, New York. As Highway 405 entirely lies within the Province of Ontario and is not subject to federal administration, its entire length is patrolled by the OPP. Highway 405 crosses the Lewiston‚ÄìQueenston Bridge into New York.  History  Highway 405 was part of a network of divided highways envisioned by Thomas McQuesten in the mid-1930s to connect New York with Ontario. Though the Queen Elizabeth Way would cross the Niagara River by 1942 in Niagara Falls, Highway 405 and the Lewiston‚ÄìQueenston Bridge would form the first direct freeway link between the neighbouring countries. Planning for both was underway by 1958, and construction began in 1960. The bridge was built at the same time as the freeway, though it opened several months earlier on November 1, 1962. Highway 405 was completed in August 1963 and officially opened to the public on September 11, 1963. In 1969, an interchange with Stanley Avenue was built and opened to traffic. In 2004, the eastern end of the freeway was modified to permit the queueing of trucks at the border. This included the addition of one lane to the eastbound carriageway beginning at Stanley Avenue, as well as the gradual removal of the interchange with the Niagara Parkway; the westbound on- ramp from the Parkway remained open to traffic until December 4, 2006. The highway was named the General Brock Parkway on October 13, 2006 in honour of the War of 1812 hero, Major General Sir Isaac Brock, who died at the Battle of Queenston Heights.

He was created by Andr√© Franquin and first appeared in Spirou et les h√©ritiers (1952). Zantafio bears a strong resemblance to Fantasio, because they are cousins. In Le dictateur et le champignon (1953), he is a South-American dictator of the fictional country Palombia. Character evolution Zantafio first appears at an inheritance contest, arrogant and in debt. He and Fantasio are the only heirs, and he who wins three challenges wins the heritage. After continually employing dirty tactics and still losing, Zantafio admits defeat, claiming to see the errors of his cheating ways, and feels guilty about it. The cousins part on good terms while searching for the Marsupilami in the Palombian rainforest. Yet, Zantafio, under the alias of General Zantas, returns as the dictator of the country, much to the surprise of Spirou and Fantasio. He offers Spirou and Fantasio a place within his army, but they are repulsed by Zantafio's change in personality. No longer friendly, Zantafio becomes merciless, brutal, and drunk on power. Spirou and Fantasio, with the inventions of the Count of Champignac, initiate a revolt in Palombia. During the revolution, Zantafio is ousted from power and disappears into the jungle.Zantafio seizes power Zantafio later strikes back at his cousin by framing him for thievery. He employs special henchmen to impersonate him and therefore disgrace him, but Spirou manages to foil his plans. Zantafio continues to return several times as the nemesis antagonist, exploring many variants of crime. He even becomes Zorglub's second-in-command and then tries to replace him to gain power in L'ombre du Z (1956). When Fournier took over the series, the criminal organisation known as the Triangle became the main recurring antagonist focus of the series. In Tora Torapa (1973), Zantafio returns as leader of the Triangle. After Fournier left the series, Zantafio disappeared for a long time as well: the new creative team of Broca & Cauvin created new villains for their short run and their successors Tome & Janry started out their run creating own villains well. Their La jeunesse de Spirou included a story from the spin-off series Le Petit Spirou, which showed Zantafio as a child (but still wearing a moustache), but this story was done for comedic purposes. In Spirou √† Moscou (1990), Zantafio returns, as the \\"White Prince of the Russian Mafia\\", attempting to become the new Tsar of Russia. He uses the alias, as well as the anagram, \\"Tanaziof\\".

The funnel originated in New Zealand. The use of a beer bong is also known as funneling.  Construction  The typical construction of a beer bong involves a large funnel connected to tubing. Beers are stockpiled in the funnel and as the user drinks, the beer will pour down the tubing. Beer bongs often have valves to engage/disengage the flow of beer.  Use  = Typical oral = One person holds a clear pipe to their mouth, while a second holds the other end of the pipe with a large plastic funnel attached. The pipe is part-filled with beer, with the remainder of the pipe and the bottom of the funnel filling with a foamy head.thumb Drinking from a beer bong is different from drinking beer normally (or other carbonated beverage). This is because the drinker is not in control of the volume of liquid entering the mouth. In addition, the force of gravity pushes the beer into the drinker's mouth and thus 'forces' the beer down. It is for this reason the beer bong often engages the gag reflex. The beer bong is either 'hit' or 'chugged'. A hit from the beer bong is when a valve is used and one drinks as much beer as they can before turning off the valve. Chugging is where an entire, or a number of beers are consumed in one use. A popular technique is to 'open' the esophagus and simply allow the beer to flow down. This takes practice and may cause pain in trying it for the first time. = Alternate rectal = Occasionally the pipe is inserted rectally to administer an alcohol enema. Called butt-chugging or boofing, this method of alcohol consumption can be dangerous or even deadly because it leads to faster intoxication since the alcohol is absorbed directly into the bloodstream and bypasses the body's ability to reject the toxin by vomiting.  In popular culture  Beer bongs came to national attention in the US after a photograph of Senator John Kerry being offered one at an Iowa University tailgate party made national newspaper front pages.

He served during the First World War in the 31st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force and was killed during the Battle of Polygon Wood during which he displayed the bravery for which he was posthumously awarded the VC. Early life Patrick Bugden was born in the Australian state of New South Wales, at South Gundurimba on 17 March 1897. His father, a farmer, died when Bugden was still a child and his mother later remarried. After completing his schooling, he worked at a hotel in Alstonville. In 1911, he commenced a year of compulsory military service. First World War Bugden enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at Brisbane on 25 May 1916, claiming to be 21 years old. After completing a period of basic training, he embarked for England in September 1916 and arrived in Plymouth in December. Shortly afterwards he was admitted to hospital sick, before being sent to France in January 1917 and being taken on strength by the 31st Battalion in March. In May 1917, he was again admitted to hospital with influenza, before being released and returning to his unit. It was at Battle of Polygon Wood near Zonnebeke in Belgium, during the Passchendaele Offensive in the period from 26 September to 28 September 1917 that Bugden performed the actions that led to his posthumous award of the Victoria Cross. During an advance by his battalion at Polygon Wood, he led small parties against strongly defended pillboxes, successfully dealing with them. He later carried out a number of rescues of wounded men, often under heavy artillery and machine gun fire. He was killed during one of these rescue missions. He was later recommended for the VC; the citation, published in the London Gazette, read: =Memorials= Bugden is buried at Hooge Crater Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery. In 1997, a memorial to his service was dedicated at Alstonville, about 30 km from Tatham. The memorial is on Bugden Avenue, and the local ANZAC Day march starts there. Bugden Avenue in the Canberra suburb of Gowrie is also named for him. The medal Bugden's VC is on display in the Queensland Museum, South Bank.

Craniotomies are often critical operations, performed on patients who are suffering from brain lesions or traumatic brain injury (TBI), and can also allow doctors to surgically implant deep brain stimulators for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and cerebellar tremor. The procedure is also widely used in neuroscience for extracellular recording, brain imaging, and for neurological manipulations such as electrical stimulation and chemical titration. The procedures are used for accessing brain tissue that must be removed, as well. Craniotomy is distinguished from craniectomy (in which the skull flap is not immediately replaced, allowing the brain to swell, thus reducing intracranial pressure) and from trepanation, the creation of a burr hole through the cranium in to the dura mater. Procedure Diagram of the elements of a craniotomy. Human craniotomy is usually performed under general anesthesia but can be also done with the patient awake using a local anaesthetic; the procedure, typically, does not involve significant discomfort for the patient. In general, a craniotomy will be preceded by an MRI scan which provides an image of the brain that the surgeon uses to plan the precise location for bone removal and the appropriate angle of access to the relevant brain areas. The amount of skull that needs to be removed depends on the type of surgery being performed. The bone flap is mostly removed with the help of a cranial drill and a craniotome, then replaced using titanium plates and screws or another form of fixation (wire, suture, etc.) after completion of the surgical procedure. In the event the host bone does not accept its replacement an artificial piece of skull, often made of PEEK, is substituted. (The PEEK appliance is routinely modeled by a CNC machine capable of accepting a high resolution MRI computer file in order to provide a very close fit, in an effort to minimize fitment issues, and therefore minimizing the duration of the cranial surgery.) Complications Bacterial meningitis or viral meningitis occurs in about 0.8 to 1.5% of individuals undergoing craniotomy. Postcraniotomy pain is frequent and moderate to severe in nature. This pain has been controlled through the use of scalp infiltrations, nerve scalp blocks, parecoxib, and morphine, morphine being the most effective in providing analgesia. According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, Infections in patients undergoing craniotomy: risk factors associated with post-craniotomy meningitis, their clinical studies indicated that \\"the risk for meningitis was independently associated with perioperative steroid use and ventricular drainage\\". Within the 334 procedures that they had conducted from males and females, their results concluded that traumatic brain injuries were the predominant causes of bacterial meningitis. At least 40% of patients became susceptible to at least one infection, creating more interconnected risk factors along the way. From the Infectious Diseases Clinic Erasme Hospital, there had been reports of infections initially beginning from either the time of surgery, skin intrusion, hematogenous seeding, or retrograde infections. Cerebrospinal fluid shunt (CSF) associates with the risk of meningitis due to the following factors: pre-shunt associated infections, post-operative CSF leakage, lack of experience from the neurosurgeon, premature birth/young age, advanced age, shunt revisions for dysfunction, and neuroendoscopes. The way shunts are operated on each patient relies heavily on the cleanliness of the site. Once bacteria penetrates the area of a CSF, the procedure becomes more complicated. The skin is especially necessary to address because it is an external organ. Scratching the incision site can easily create an infection due to there being no barrier between the open air and wound. Aside from scratching, decubitus ulcer and tissues near the shunt site are also leading pathways for infection susceptibility. It is also common to give patients seven days of anti-seizure medications post operatively. Traditionally this has been phenytoin, but now is increasingly levetiracetam as it has a lower risk of drug-drug interactions.

William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper, (10 October 1723) was an English politician who became the first Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. Cowper was the son of Sir William Cowper, 2nd Baronet, of Ratling Court, Kent, a Whig member of parliament of some mark in the two last Stuart reigns. Career and titles Cowper was educated at St Albans School in Hertfordshire, and was later to acquire a country estate in the county and represent the county town in Parliament. He was admitted to Middle Temple on 18 March 1681/82, was called to the bar on 25 May 1688, and built up a large practice. He gave his allegiance to the Prince of Orange on his landing in England in 1688, and was made King's Counsel and recorder of Colchester in 1694. Cowper had the reputation of being one of the most effective parliamentary orators of his generation. He lost his seat in parliament in 1702 owing to the unpopularity caused by the trial of his brother Spencer Cowper on a charge of murder. =Lord Keeper of the Great Seal= On 11 October 1705 he was sworn to the Privy Council, was appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and took his seat on the woolsack without a peerage. In the following year he conducted the negotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners for arranging the union with Scotland. In November of that year he succeeded to his father's baronetcy, and on 14 December 1706 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Cowper of Wingham, Kent. He was the youngest Lord Keeper for many years: the Queen, who had taken a great liking to him, joked that \\"she had given the Seals to a boy\\" and suggested that in future he wear a wig to lend him gravity.Gregg, Edward Queen Anne Yale University Press 2001 p. 206 =Lord High Chancellor= When the union with Scotland came into operation in May 1707 the Queen in Council named Cowper Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, he being the first to hold this office. He presided at the trial of Dr Sacheverell in 1710, but resigned the seal when Harley and Bolingbroke took office in the same year. Queen Anne, who had a high regard for him, \\"begged him with tears in her eyes\\" not to resign,Gregg, p.323 and though she was reluctantly persuaded to accept his resignation, continued to consult him unofficially for the remainder of her reign.Gregg p.331 On the death of Queen Anne, George I appointed Cowper one of the Lords Justice for governing the country during the king's absence, and a few weeks later he again became Lord Chancellor. =Lord High Steward= A paper which Cowper drew up for the guidance of the new king on constitutional matters, entitled An Impartial History of Parties, marks the advance of English opinion towards party government in the modern sense. It was published by Lord Campbell in his Lives of the Lord Chancellors. Cowper supported the impeachment of Lord Oxford for high treason in 1715, and in 1716 presided as Lord High Steward at the trials of the peers charged with complicity in the Jacobite rising, his sentences on whom have been censured as unnecessarily severe. He warmly supported the Septennial Bill in the same year. =Viscount Fordwich and Earl Cowper= On 18 March 1718 he was created Viscount Fordwich and Earl Cowper, and a month later he resigned office on the plea of ill-health, but probably in reality because George I accused him of espousing the Prince of Wales's side in the prince's quarrel with the king. Taking the lead against his former colleagues, Cowper opposed the proposed Peerage Bill brought forward in 1719 to limit the number of peers, and also opposed the bill of attainder against Atterbury in 1723. Cowper was not a great lawyer, but Burnet says that he managed the Court of Chancery with impartial justice and great despatch; the most eminent of his contemporaries agreed in extolling his oratory and his virtues. It is notable that Queen Anne, despite her prejudice against the Whigs in general, came to have a great respect and liking for Cowper, and continued to seek his advice even after he left office as Lord Chancellor. Trial of Spencer Cowper His younger brother, Spencer Cowper (1669‚Äì1728), was tried for the murder of Sarah Stout in 1699, but was acquitted; the lady, who had allegedly fallen in love with Cowper, having committed suicide on account of his inattention‚Äîat least according to Cowper's lawyers. Spencer was one of the managers of the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, was Attorney- General to the Prince of Wales (1714), Chief Justice of Chester (1717), and Judge of the Common Pleas (1727). He was great uncle of William Cowper, the poet. Personal life =Marriages= William Cowper was twice married: first, in about 1686, to Judith, daughter and heiress of Sir Robert Booth, a London merchant; and secondly, in 1706, to Mary, daughter of John Clavering, of Chopwell, Durham. The latter marriage seems to have been based on Cowper's admiration of her beauty although he demanded to see her undressed before the wedding.William Cowper, History of Parliament, Retrieved 12 February 2017 Swift (Examiner, xvii., xxii.) alludes to an allegation that Cowper had been guilty of bigamy, for which there appears to have been no solid foundation. The 1st Earl left two sons and two daughters by his second wife; the elder son, also William, inherited his titles, and the younger, Spencer Cowper became Dean of Durham. =Mistress= Elizabeth Culling was the mistress of William Cowper, and bore him two children. She was the daughter of John Culling of Hertingfordbury Park, who died in 1687/8, and was buried in St Helen's, Bishopsgate. Her brother John died in January 1702/3 without issue, and Elizabeth inherited the estate. She died on 27 November 1703, and was buried at Hertingfordbury. Of her children, William, born on 14 November 1697, died in Paris on 31 October 1719. Mary, born on 10 September 1700, lived to maturity, and married one Robert Isaacson. =Polygamy allegation= The rumours about Lord Cowper's polygamy appeared to be based on the fact that Elizabeth Culling was of a station in life that perhaps would, in other circumstances, have led to her becoming the wife, rather than the mistress, of William Cowper. In her will she acknowledges that the children are her natural children, and the children were also acknowledged by Lord Cowper and his second wife, as will be seen from the correspondence.National Archives Later years and death In his last years Cowper was accused, but probably without reason, of active sympathy with the Jacobites. He died at his residence, Cole Green near Panshanger in Hertfordshire on 10 October 1723. Mary, who was devastated by his death, outlived him by only a few months.

It is one of the 16 stereoisomers of 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. In aqueous solution at neutral pH, gluconic acid forms the gluconate ion. The salts of gluconic acid are known as \\"gluconates\\". Gluconic acid, gluconate salts, and gluconate esters occur widely in nature because such species arise from the oxidation of glucose. Some drugs are injected in the form of gluconates. Chemical structure The chemical structure of gluconic acid consists of a six-carbon chain, with five hydroxyl groups positioned in the same way as in the open chained form of glucose, terminating in a carboxylic acid group. In aqueous solution, gluconic acid exists in equilibrium with the cyclic ester glucono delta-lactone. Occurrence and uses Gluconic acid occurs naturally in fruit, honey, and wine. In 1929 Horace Terhune Herrick developed a process for producing the salt by fermentation. As a food additive (E574Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers. Food Standards Agency.), it is now known as an acidity regulator. The gluconate anion chelates Ca2+, Fe2+, Al3+, and other metals, including lanthanides and actinides. It is also used in cleaning products, where it dissolves mineral deposits, especially in alkaline solution. Calcium gluconate, in the form of a gel, is used to treat burns from hydrofluoric acid; calcium gluconate injections may be used for more severe cases to avoid necrosis of deep tissues, as well as to treat hypocalcemia in hospitalized patients. Gluconate is also an electrolyte present in certain solutions, such as \\"plasmalyte a\\", used for intravenous fluid resuscitation. D. Thomas, U. Jaeger, I. Sagoschen, C. Lamberti and K.

Gluconate is used as a concrete admixture (retarder) to slow down the cement hydration reactions and to delay the cement setting time. It allows so a longer time to place the concrete or to spread the cement hydration heat on a longer period of time to avoid too high temperature and the resulting cracks. Retarders are mixed to concrete when the weather temperature is high or to cast large and thick concrete slabs in successive and sufficiently well mixed layers.

He was educated at Eton College and King's College, Cambridge, and in 1814 was appointed assistant master at Eton under John Keate. In 1834 he became headmaster of Eton, which role he performed until 1853, when he was elected Provost of Eton following the death of Francis Hodgson. While he was headmaster and Hodgson was Provost, new buildings were erected, including the school library and the sanatorium, the college chapel was restored, the Old Christopher Inn was closed, and the custom of Montem, the collection by street begging of funds for the university expenses of the captain of the school, was suppressed. Hawtrey is supposed to have suggested the modern language prizes given by Prince Albert, and himself founded the prize for English essay. In 1852 he became provost of Eton, and in 1854 vicar of Mapledurham. He was buried in the Eton College chapel. On account of his command of languages, he was known in London as \\"the English Mezzofanti\\", and he was a book collector of the finest taste. Among his own books are some translations from the English into Italian, German and Greek.

The Roman cult to Sol is continuous from the \\"earliest history\\" of the city until the institution of the Christian cult as the exclusive state religion. Scholars have sometimes regarded the traditional Sol and Sol Invictus as two separate deities, but the rejection of this view by S. E. Hijmans has found supporters.

An inscription of AD 102 records a restoration of a portico of Sol in what is now the Trastevere area of Rome by a certain Gaius Iulius Anicetus.

Romanising Oriental Gods: Myth, Salvation, and Ethics in the Cults of Cybele, Isis, and Mithras, p. 100. Brill. The relation of the Mithraic Sol Invictus to the public cult of the deity with the same name is unclear and perhaps non-existent.(Alvar, 2008, p. 203)  Elagabalus  According to the Historia Augusta, Elagabalus, the teenaged Severan heir, adopted the name of his deity and brought his cult image from Emesa to Rome. Once installed as emperor, he neglected Rome's traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome's most powerful deity. This ended with his murder in 222. The Historia Augusta equates the deity Elagabalus with Jupiter and Sol: fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis sacerdos, \\"He was also a priest of Heliogabalus, or Jove, or Sol\\".Historia Augusta, 1, 5: English translation (Loeb) from Thayer & Latin text While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome,See in particular Halsberghe 1972. the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome since the early Republic.Hijmans 1996, Matern 2001, Wallraff 2002, Berrens 2004, ).  Aurelian  Roman Imperial repouss√© silver disc of Sol Invictus (3rd century), found at Pessinus (British Museum) The Roman gens Aurelia was associated with the cult of Sol.J.C. Richard, \\"Le culte de Sol et les Aurelii: √Ä propos de Paul Fest. p. 22 L.\\", in M√©langes offerts √† Jacques Heurgon: L'Italie pr√©romaine et la Rome r√©publicaine (Rome, 1976), 915‚Äì925. After his victories in the East, the Emperor Aurelian thoroughly reformed the Roman cult of Sol, elevating the sun-god to one of the premier divinities of the Empire. Where previously priests of Sol had been simply sacerdotes and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society, they were now pontifices and members of the new college of pontifices instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J. Rupke (ed.), Fasti Sacerdotum (2005), p. 606. Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus lists his priesthoods as pontifex of Vesta, one of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, and pontifex of Sol, in that order (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum vol. 6, 1739‚Äì1742). In a list of eight priesthoods, Vettius Agorius Praetextatus puts Pontifex Solis in third place (). Aurelian also built a new temple for Sol, which was dedicated on December 25, 274, and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four.The other three were in the Circus Maximus, on the Quirinal, and in Trastevere. He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards. The identity of Aurelian's Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the Augustan History, some scholars have argued that it was based on Sol Elagablus (or Elagabla) of Emesa. Others, basing their argument on Zosimus, suggest that it was based on the ≈†ams, the solar god of Palmyra on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus. Professor Gary Forsythe discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one based on the work of Steven Hijmans. Hijmans argues that Aurelian's solar deity was simply the traditional Greco-Roman Sol Invictus.  Constantine  Constantine I depicting Sol Invictus with the legend SOLI INVICTO COMITI, c. 315 Emperors portrayed Sol Invictus on their official coinage, with a wide range of legends, only a few of which incorporated the epithet invictus, such as the legend SOLI INVICTO COMITI, claiming the Unconquered Sun as a companion to the Emperor, used with particular frequency by Constantine.A comprehensive discussion of all sol- coinage and sol-legends per emperor from Septimius Severus to Constantine can be found in Berrens (2004). Statuettes of Sol Invictus, carried by the standard-bearers, appear in three places in reliefs on the Arch of Constantine. Constantine's official coinage continues to bear images of Sol until 325/6. A solidus of Constantine as well as a gold medallion from his reign depict the Emperor's bust in profile twinned (jugate) with Sol Invictus, with the legend INVICTUS CONSTANTINUSThe medal is illustrated in Jocelyn M.C. Toynbee, Roman Medallions (1944, reprinted 1987) plate xvii, no. 11; the solidus is illustrated in J. Maurice, Numismatique Constantinienne vol. II, p. 236, plate vii, no. 14 Constantine decreed (March 7, 321) dies Solis‚Äîday of the Sun, \\"Sunday\\"‚Äîas the Roman day of rest : On the venerable day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country however persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue their pursuits because it often happens that another day is not suitable for grain-sowing or vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper moment for such operations the bounty of heaven should be lost.Excellent discussion of this decree by Wallraff 2002, 96‚Äì102. Constantine's triumphal arch was carefully positioned to align with the colossal statue of Sol by the Colosseum, so that Sol formed the dominant backdrop when seen from the direction of the main approach towards the arch.E. Marlowe, \\"Framing the sun. The Arch of Constantine and the Roman cityscape\\", Art Bulletin 88 (2006) 223‚Äì242.  Sol and the other Roman Emperors  BerrensS. Berrens, Sonnenkult und Kaisertum von den Severern bis zu Constantin I. (193‚Äì337 n. Chr.) Stuttgart: Steiner 2004 (Historia-Einzelschriften 185). deals with coin-evidence of Imperial connection to the Solar cult. Sol is depicted sporadically on imperial coins in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, then more frequently from Septimius Severus onwards until AD 325/6. Sol invictus appears on coin legends from AD 261, well before the reign of Aurelian.Berrens 2004, precise p. number to follow. The coinage Elagabalus does not use invictus for Roman Sol, nor the Emesan Solar deity Elagabalus. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Identical reverse as the coin of Constantine I but with Emperor Licinius on head  Probus, c. 280, with Sol Invictus riding a quadriga, with legend SOLI INVICTO, \\"to the Unconquered Sun\\": the Emperor (at left) wears a radiated solar crown, worn also by the god on the obverse  Aurelian in his radiate crown, on a silvered bronze coin struck at Rome, 274‚Äì275 } Connections between the imperial radiate crown and the cult of Sol are postulated. Augustus was posthumously depicted with radiate crown, as were living emperors from Nero (after AD 65) to Constantine. Some modern scholarship interprets the imperial radiate crown as a divine, solar association rather than an overt symbol of Sol; Bergmann calls it a pseudo- object designed to disguise the divine and solar connotations that would otherwise be politically controversialBergmann 1998, 121‚Äì123S. Hijmans, \\"Metaphor, Symbol and Reality: the Polysemy of the Imperial Radiate Crown\\", in: C. C. Mattusch (ed.), Common ground. Archaeology, art, science, and humanities. Proceedings of the XVIth International Congress of Classical Archaeology, Boston, August 23‚Äì26, 2003, Oxford (2006), 440‚Äì443; but there is broad agreement that coin-images showing the imperial radiate crown are stylistically distinct from those of the solar crown of rays; the imperial radiate crown is depicted as a real object rather than as symbolic light.Bergmann 1998, 116‚Äì117; Hijmans 2009, 82‚Äì83. Hijmans argues that the Imperial radiate crown represents the honorary wreath awarded to Augustus, perhaps posthumously, to commemorate his victory at the Battle of Actium; he points out that henceforth, living emperors were depicted with radiate crowns, but state divi were not. To Hijmans this implies the radiate crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as \\"saviour of the Republic\\" through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo- Helios. Wreaths awarded to victors at the Actian Games were radiate.Hijmans 2009, 509‚Äì548. A mosaic floor in the Baths of the Porta Marina at Ostia depicts a radiate victory crown on a table as well as a victorious competitor wearing one.  Festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti The Philocalian calendar of AD 354 gives a festival of \\"Natalis Invicti\\" on 25 December. There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid-4th century.Wallraff 2001: 174‚Äì177. Hoey (1939: 480) writes: \\"An inscription of unique interest from the reign of Licinius embodies the official prescription for the annual celebration by his army of a festival of Sol Invictus on December 19\\". The inscription (Dessau, Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 8940) actually prescribes an annual offering to Sol on November 18 (die XIV Kal(endis) Decemb(ribus), i.e., on the fourteenth day before the Kalends of December).Text at Parts 6 and 12 respectively. Whether this date was intended to celebrate solstice is doubtful; one scholar writes that \\"the cult of the Sun in pagan Rome ironically did not celebrate the winter solstice nor any of the other quarter-tense days, as one might expect\\".Michael Alan Anderson, Symbols of Saints (ProQuest 2008 ), pp. 45‚Äì46 Since the 12th century,Bishop Jacob Bar-Salabi (cited in Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries, Ramsay MacMullen. Yale:1997, p. 155) there have been speculations that the near-solstice date of 25 December for Christmas was selected because it was the date of the festival of Dies Natalis Solis Invicti. Legacy  = Christianity = According to some historians, Christmas was set to December 25th because it was the date of the festival of Sol Invictus. This idea became popular especially in the 18thSir Edward Burnett Tylor, Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom, Volume 2, p. 270; John Murray, London, 1871; revised edition 1889.Philip Schaff, History of the Christian Church, Volume 3, 1885, T and T Clark, Edinburgh, page 396; see also Volume 4 in the 3rd edition, 1910 (Charles Scribner's Sons, NY). and 19th centuries. The charioteer in the mosaic of Mausoleum M has been interpreted by some as Christ. Clement of Alexandria had spoken of Christ driving his chariot across the sky. This interpretation is doubted by others: \\"Only the cross-shaped nimbus makes the Christian significance apparent\\",, emphasis added and the figure is seen by some simply as a representation of the Sun with no explicit religious reference whatever, pagan or Christian. =Judaism= Mosaic in the Beth Alpha synagogue, with the Sun in the centre, surrounded by the twelve zodiac constellations and with the four seasons associated inaccurately with the constellations The traditional image of the Sun has also been used in early Jewish art. A mosaic floor in Hamat Tiberias presents David as Helios surrounded by a ring with the signs of the zodiac.David R. Cartlidge, James Keith Elliott, The Art of Christian Legend (Routledge 2001 ), p. 64 As well as in Hamat Tiberias, figures of Helios or Sol Invictus also appear in several of the very few surviving schemes of decoration surviving from Late Antique synagogues, including Beth Alpha, Husefa, all now in Israel, and Naaran in the West Bank. He is shown in floor mosaics, with the usual radiate halo, and sometimes in a quadriga, in the central roundel of a circular representation of the zodiac or the seasons.

She is best known for the collaboration with her brother Charles on the collection Tales from Shakespeare. Mary suffered from mental illness, and in 1796 she stabbed her mother to death during a mental breakdown. She was confined to mental facilities for most of her remaining life. She and Charles presided over a literary circle in London that included the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, among others. Early life Mary Lamb was born in London on 3 December 1764, the third of seven children of John and Elizabeth Lamb. Her parents worked for Samuel Salt, a barrister in London, and the family lived above Salt in his home at 2 Crown Office Row in the Inner Temple. Only two of Mary's siblings survived: her older brother John Jr. and her younger brother Charles. Mary learned about literature and writers from her father's stories of the times he had seen Samuel Johnson, who lived nearby, and his visitors. Mary remembered seeing, at the age of five, the writer Oliver Goldsmith in the street, and she also witnessed David Garrick's acting. Her father may have taken her with him on his trips to the Pope's Head book shop nearby. Samuel Salt died in 1792, and the Lambs had to move out of their lodgings soon after (see tied accommodation). John Lamb continued to work in his old position in the Great Hall of the Inner Temple, where he had waited on Salt, but his wages were not sufficient to keep the lodgings that had been provided without cost by Salt. Samuel Salt left ¬£600 to the Lambs, along with small annuities. They moved to a home in Little Queen Street, near High Holborn. Around this time, John Lamb had a stroke, losing most of the use of his left hand. John was allowed to continue receiving his salary while another man stood in for him in the Inner Temple, performing his duties. This arrangement lasted until John's death in 1799. In the early 1790s, Elizabeth Lamb began to experience debilitating pain, possibly from arthritis, which ended up crippling her. Mary, the only other person at home during the day, took responsibility for her mother's care. By 1796, Elizabeth was completely helpless and dependent on Mary. John's sister Sarah Lamb also lived with the family, and her care was spread between Charles and Mary. In 1795 Charles had a mental breakdown, and spent the end of 1795 to the beginning of 1796 in a private mental facility. During this time, Mary worked as a seamstress, along with a little girl who served as her apprentice. The responsibilities and expectations placed on Mary began to be a serious burden for her toward the end of 1796. Her father had become senile, her mother required constant care, and her brother John had had an accident, and had moved back in with the family, so that he too could be cared for by her. Mary may also have had difficulties in training her young apprentice. The situation began to affect her mental stability. Murder of Elizabeth Lamb On 22 September 1796, while preparing dinner, Mary became angry with her apprentice, roughly shoving the little girl out of her way and pushing her into another room. Elizabeth began shouting at her for this. Mary suffered a mental break-down as her mother continued shouting at her. She took the kitchen knife she had been holding, unsheathed it, and approached her mother, who was sitting down. She then fatally stabbed her mother in the chest, in full view of John and Sarah Lamb who were standing nearby. Charles ran into the house soon after the murder and took the knife out of Mary's hand. Later in the evening Mary was confined in a local mental facility called Fisher House, in Islington, a place found for her by Charles through a doctor friend of his. Charles took over responsibility for Mary after refusing his brother John's suggestion that they have her committed to a public facility. A few days later, the murder was reported in the newspapers. The coroner had returned a verdict of lunacy. A month after the murder, while still at Fisher House, Mary told Charles she had come to terms with her guilt over the murder, and felt that she had for the most part been a good and faithful daughter. Middle years Six months after the murder, Charles removed Mary from Fisher House and brought her to live in a house in the village of Hackney, not far from London. Charles spent his Sundays and holidays with Mary, leaving her in the care of his landlords for the rest of the time. Mary continued to work as a seamstress, and subscribed to the local lending libraries, as she was a voracious reader throughout her life. Charles's poem \\"Written on Christmas Day, 1797\\" demonstrated his feelings toward his sister, to whom he had made a lifelong commitment. On 13 April 1799 John Lamb died. Sarah Lamb had died in 1797, and with John's death, Charles was able to bring Mary back to London to live with him. They both decided that they would remain unmarried and live together for the rest of their lives, in a state described by Charles as \\"a sort of double singleness\\". Charles by Francis Stephen Cary, 1834 In 1800, after the death of their housekeeper, Mary had to be confined again for a month. Through the rest of her life, Mary would occasionally spend time in mental facilities when she or Charles felt that her mental derangement was returning. Over time, Mary and Charles rebuilt the very close and loving relationship they had had before their mother's death. In his essay \\"Mackery End\\" Charles wrote that \\"We are both of us inclined to be a little too positive...But where we have differed upon moral points; upon something proper to be done, or let alone; whatever heat of opposition, or steadiness of conviction, I set out with, I am sure always, in the long run, to be brought over to her way of thinking.\\" Her sense of humour was so little developed, as compared with her brother's, that he described a play on words she made at the age of 50 as being her first joke. In 1801, the Lambs formed a literary and social circle that included minor artists and writers, and occasional visits from Charles's friends Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. At this time, Mary also met two of the best female friends of her life, Sarah Stoddart and Dorothy Wordsworth. Charles began drinking heavily around this time, a problem that followed him until his death. Mary patiently watched over Charles when he was drunk, just as he had always watched over her. In 1806, William Godwin (Mary Wollstonecraft's widower) and his second wife Mary Jane Godwin (mother of Claire Clairmont), who had become close with the Lambs through their shared literary work of the past few years, asked Mary to write something for their Juvenile Library. This was the beginning of Charles and Mary's collaboration on Tales from Shakespeare. During the writing of the Tales, Mary realised that she could make a living writing these types of works for children. The finished collection of Tales was published in 1807, with a second edition coming out in 1809. Artists who made illustrations for the Tales included William Mulready and the poet William Blake. In 1808 the Lambs developed a closer friendship with an earlier acquaintance, William Hazlitt, who had recently married Mary's friend Sarah Stoddart, sister of the journalist John Stoddart. Mary began writing her collection of tales Mrs. Leicester's School in 1808, publishing it at the end of the year, though the original title page stated the date as 1809. According to Charles, the work was mostly Mary's with only a small collaborative effort by him. The book had gone through nine editions by 1825. In 1810 Charles and Mary published another collaboration, Poems for Children. Their writing brought them financial security and vaulted them solidly into the middle class. Mary had difficulties adjusting to middle- class life, as she had to hire and govern servants though she was used to doing household work herself. Later life The Lambs' home in Edmonton In December 1814 Mary wrote an article entitled \\"On Needle-work\\", published in the New British Lady's Magazine the following year under the pseudonym Sempronia. The article argued that sewing should be made a recognised profession to give independence to women whose only skill and way of making a living was sewing, which at the time was something they were mostly obliged to do as part of their household duties. Mary had a relapse of her mental illness soon after publication of the article. In 1820 Charles began writing of the Essays of Elia, in some of which he described her under the name of Bridget Elia. At this time his and Mary's literary gatherings grew in importance, with new members joining the circle including Thomas Noon Talfourd and Bryan Procter. In 1820 they met a young girl named Emma Isola, who may have been introduced to them by William Wordsworth. Emma stayed with the Lambs several times over the next few years. After her father's death in 1823, when she was 14, Emma was adopted by the Lambs. She spent five happy years with them until finding a position as a governess. During the time that the three lived together, the Lambs moved to a country house. In 1825, Charles resigned from his position at the East India House. In the later 1820s Mary's mental illness progressed, her periods of dementia lasting longer and becoming deeper, while new symptoms of depression and detachment appeared. Charles's health became more infirm as well through these years. In 1833 Mary moved to a house for mentally ill people in Edmonton, Middlesex; Charles soon followed. Charles never lost his love and devotion for his sister, even as her illness continued to worsen. \\"I could be nowhere happier than under the same roof as her,\\" he said in 1834. The death of Coleridge in July 1834 was a great blow to Charles. Charles died on 27 December 1834. According to family friend Henry Crabb Robinson, Mary was \\"quite insane\\" at this time and unable to fully feel grief at the death of her brother, though she recovered so far as to be able to persuade Wordsworth to write lines for her brother's memorial stone. Mary lived on at Edmonton until 1842 when she moved with her nurses to a house in London. She exchanged visits with friends when her mind was strong enough, but her hearing deteriorated in the mid-1840s, making it difficult for her to communicate with others. She died on 20 May 1847, and was buried next to her brother in the Edmonton Churchyard in Middlesex.Francis, J. C. Notes by the way (1909) [Page:Notes by the Way.djvu/72 p.2]. Retrieved 3 January 2009. Legacy 1922 frontispiece illustration for Tales from Shakespeare At the time of her death, few people outside of hers and her brother's immediate circle of friends knew about either her mental problems or the circumstances of her mother's death. Their friend Talfourd soon published a memoir of the Lambs carefully and respectfully giving details of Mary's mental condition, while praising her as a friend and writer. One intention of Talfourd's was to boost the reputation of Charles by showing how much he had done for his beloved sister. He said that Mary was \\"remarkable for the sweetness of her disposition, the clearness of her understanding, and the gentle wisdom of all her acts and words\\", and that \\"To a friend in any difficulty she was the most comfortable of advisers, the wisest of consolers.\\" Hazlitt called her the one thoroughly reasonable woman he had ever met. She was, in fact, a favourite among Charles's literary friends. Nevertheless, periodicals of the time, such as the British Quarterly Review, did not write about her with the same kindness and respect. Subsequently, Charles and Mary Lamb's story was explored by Dorothy Parker and Ross Evans in their 1949 play The Coast of Illyria. Mary was depicted as the central character in The Lambs of London (2004), a novel by Peter Ackroyd. She is also the subject of a 2004 biographical study by British writer Kathy Watson, The Devil Kissed Her, and a 2005 biography by Susan Tyler Hitchcock, Mad Mary Lamb: Lunacy And Murder In Literary London. She appears in the first chapter of Lisa Appignanesi's book on women and mental illness, Mad, Bad, & Sad. The Lambs appear in one episode of Sue Limb's radio comedy The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere, a pastiche of the poet William Wordsworth and his circle at Grasmere. An essay on Charles and Mary Lamb, entitled \\"The Unfuzzy Lamb,\\" appeared in Anne Fadiman's book, At Large and at Small: Familiar Essays (2007).

He was an ardent republican and a regicide of King Charles I of England. Life Marten was the elder son of the successful lawyer and diplomat Sir Henry Marten; his other known siblings were a brother, George Giles Martin, and three sisters, Elizabeth, Jane, and Mary. Henry \\"Harry\\" Marten was born at his father's house on 3 Merton Street, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England (UK).http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/streets/inscriptions/central/marten.html and educated in the same city. Marten matriculated on 31 October 1617 as a gentleman commoner from University College, graduating BA in 1620. Like many young men of his social background he also entered the Inns of Court. He may have been the Henry Marten admitted to Gray's Inn in August 1618 and was certainly admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1619. In the 1620s he toured Europe and enjoyed much high living there, but also during his time in France he was exposed to the thinking of the French stoical philosophers. As a public figure, Marten first came to prominence in 1639 when he refused to contribute to a general loan. In April 1640, he was elected Member of Parliament for Berkshire in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Berkshire for the Long Parliament in November 1640. He lived at Beckett Hall in Shrivenham (now in Oxfordshire) and soon afterwards, his official residence became Longworth House in nearby Longworth. He preferred to live in London. In the House of Commons, he joined the popular party, spoke in favour of the proposed bill of attainder against Strafford, and in 1642 was a member of the committee of safety. Some of his language about the king was so frank that Charles demanded his arrest and his trial for high treason. When the English Civil War broke out Marten did not take the field, although he was appointed governor of Reading, Berkshire, but in Parliament he was very active. On one occasion his zeal in the parliamentary cause led him to open a letter from the Earl of Northumberland to his countess, an impertinence for which, says Clarendon, he was cudgelled by the Earl. In 1643 he was expelled from the Houses of Parliament and briefly imprisoned in the Tower of London for expressing the view that the royal family should be extirpated and monarchy brought to an end. In 1644, however, he was made governor of Aylesbury, and about this time took direct part in the war.\\"He commanded a troop in the Berkshire-trained bands and was appointed governor of Aylesbury on 22 May 1644. During the winter of 1645‚Äì6 he acted as commander-in-chief, under Colonel Dalbier, of the infantry at the siege of Donnington Castle.\\" Allowed to return to Parliament in January 1646, Marten again advocated extreme republican views. He spoke of his desire to prepare the king for heaven; he attacked the Presbyterians, and, supporting the New Model Army against the Long Parliament, he signed the agreement of August 1647. He was closely associated with John Lilburne and the Levellers, and was one of those who suspected the sincerity of Oliver Cromwell, whose murder he is said personally to have contemplated. However, he acted with Cromwell in bringing Charles I to trial; he was one of the most prominent of the 31 of 59 Commissioners to sign the death warrant in 1649. He was then energetic in establishing the Commonwealth and in destroying the remaining vestiges of the monarchical system. He was chosen a member of the Council of State in 1649, and as compensation for his losses and reward for his services during the war, lands valued at ¬£1000 a year were settled upon him. In parliament he spoke often and with effect, but he took no part in public life during the Protectorate, passing part of this time in prison, where he was placed on account of his debts. Having sat among the restored members of the Long Parliament in 1659, Marten surrendered himself to the authorities as a regicide in June 1660, and with some others he was excepted from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, but with a saving clause. He behaved courageously at his trial, which took place in October 1660, but he was found guilty of taking part in the king's death. Through the action, or rather the inaction of the House of Lords, he was spared the death penalty, but he remained a captive. Marten's Tower, his apartments within Chepstow Castle Having escaped the death penalty for his involvement in the regicide Marten was sent into internal exile, first in the far north of England and then (1665) to Windsor Castle, where he remained until Charles II ordered him to be moved away from such close proximity to himself. In 1668 Marten was sent to Chepstow, in Wales. Marten's imprisonment there lasted some twelve years but does not appear to have been unduly arduous, at least at first; he had a suite of rooms in what was then known as Bigod's Tower (now known as Marten's Tower) and seems to have been able to travel outside at times. His legitimate wife Margaret lived apart from him, remaining at the family home in Berkshire, but he was attended there by Mary Ward, his common-law wife. Marten died at Chepstow Castle on 9 September 1680, having choked while eating his supper, and was buried beneath the floor at an entryway of Priory and Parish Church of St Mary, Chepstow, Monmouthshire, Wales, UK.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/139462897 Character and beliefs Although a leading Puritan, Marten enjoyed good living. He had a contemporary reputation as a heavy drinker and was widely said to be a man of loose morals. According to John Aubrey he was \\"a great lover of pretty girls to whom he was so liberal that he spent the greatest part of his estate\\" upon them. In the opinion of King Charles I he was \\"an ugly rascal and whore- master\\". He married twice (to Elizabeth Lovelace and Margaret Staunton (n√©e West) but had an open and lengthy relationship with Mary Ward, a woman not his wife, by whom he had three daughters.\\"There is evidence that they were a couple from as early as 1649, when they lavishly entertained visiting dignitaries and kept liveried servants together. They may well have been a couple from Marten's earliest time in London in 1640. If so, this was a relationship that remained constant for forty years. It was, however, adulterous, and Marten was quite open about it. Mary referred to herself, and was referred to by others, as Mary Marten...The couple had three daughters: Peggy, Sarah, and Henrietta\\" Ward ultimately was to remain with him throughout his later imprisonment. His enemies branded him an atheist but his religious views were more complex, and influenced his position regarding the need to allow freedom of worship and conscience.\\"Marten also had radical views about religion. He was accused of being an atheist, but he did make a statement which implied that he did not question whether God existed but that his viewpoint was of radical scepticism because mankind did not possess the faculties to know what or who God was... Marten's scepticism meant it was incumbent on mankind to allow total toleration of all religious viewpoints. People did not have the knowledge, or the authority that knowledge would have conveyed, to pronounce one opinion on religion more right than another. This was a viewpoint that Marten carried through his political career, arguing for liberty even for Catholics...Marten also opposed the conquest of Ireland on grounds that the English could not seek religious freedom for themselves and then impose a religious settlement on others.\\" . His political views throughout his life were constant: he opposed one-man rule\\"As early as 1641 Marten confessed to his friend Sir Edward Hyde that he did not believe that one man was wise enough to rule a whole nation\\" and was in favour of representative government. In 1643, even while the king was losing the First Civil War and Parliament's cause was beginning to triumph, Marten's republican sentiments led to his arrest and brief imprisonment.\\"Marten stated in the Commons on 16 August 1643 that 'it were better one family be destroyed than many' (Mercurius Aulicus, 19 August 1643). On being challenged to reveal to whom he referred he added without hesitation that he meant the king and his family. He was immediately imprisoned in the Tower of London and barred from the Commons\\" Thus for his time Marten was unusual in his political stance, being unashamedly in favour not of reforming the monarchy but of replacing it with a republic.\\"Marten's political views remained unshakeable throughout his lifetime. He was always committed to a republican polity and was infamous in the early 1640s as the only person prepared to admit to such a view.\\" Works Marten was not a copious author, often beginning works and not carrying them through to completion. Nevertheless, he wrote and published several pamphlets, all on political topics: * A Corrector of the Answerer to the Speech out of Doores (1646) * An Unhappie Game at Scotch and English (1646) * The Independency of England Endeavoured to be Maintained (1648) * The Parliaments Proceedings Justified in Declining a Personall Treaty (1648) In 1662 there appeared Henry Marten's Familiar Letters to his Lady of Delight, containing letters Marten had written to his common-law wife, Mary Ward, which had been seized and published without permission.

The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography identifies him as the eldest son of Anthony Marten, a merchant of London, originally from Wokingham, Berkshire, and his wife Margaret, daughter of John Yate of Lydford, Berkshire. It quotes John Aubrey, writing in 1680 (Brief Lives, 1.43), as giving Marten's birthplace as Stoke Pages, Buckinghamshire.

Edward Cave and John Nicols, Vol.100, 1830, p.403 Marten was educated at Winchester College and matriculated at New College, Oxford on 24 November 1581, aged 19. He became a fellow of the college in 1582 and studied civil and canon law. He graduated BCL in 1587 and DCL in 1592, and was admitted a member of the College of Advocates on 16 October 1596. He developed a large practice as a barrister in the admiralty, prerogative, and high commission courts, and was appointed official of the archdeaconry of Berkshire. Marten was made King's advocate on 3 March 1609 and in March 1613 was sent abroad in connection with the marriage settlement of the Lady Elizabeth. In 1616, he was made chancellor of the diocese of London. He was knighted at Theobalds on 21 December 1616.Knights of England and in 1617 became a judge of the admiralty court. Later he was appointed a member of the court of high commission and dean of the arches. Marten started investing in land in Berkshire buying firstly property at West Challow in the Vale of White Horse, secondly Longworth House at Longworth which he bought for ¬£9,500 in 1618, and thirdly Hinton Waldrist Manor. In 1625 Marten was elected Member of Parliament for St Germans and supported Sir John Eliot in attacking the Duke of Buckingham. His tone was described as studiously moderate. While parliament was prorogued in 1626, he was involved in the committal of Sir Robert Howard by the high commission, and when he was re-elected MP for St Germans in 1626, an attempt was made to exclude him because of the case. He pleaded ignorance of the distinction between prorogation and dissolution and was allowed to take his seat. In 1628 he was elected MP for Oxford University, taking part in the debates on the Petition of Right and sitting until 1629 when King Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, Marten was elected MP for St Ives in the Short Parliament. He did not stand for the Long Parliament which fined him ¬£250 for his part in the case of Sir Robert Howard. Marten married Elizabeth Harding, the sister of John Harding, and had two sons and three daughters. He was father of the regicide Henry Marten.

His career began during the molecular biology revolution of the 1950s, and he eventually rose to prominence in the fields of molecular and behavioral genetics. He led a productive genetics research lab both at Purdue University and as the James G. Boswell Professor of Neuroscience, Emeritus, at the California Institute of Technology. Biography =Early life and education= Benzer was born in South Bronx, to Meyer B. and Eva Naidorf, both Jews from Poland.http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/27/1/OH_Benzer_S.pdf He had two older sisters, and his parents favored him as the only boy. One of Benzer's earliest scientific experiences was dissecting frogs he had caught as a boy. In an interview at Caltech, Benzer also remembered receiving a microscope for his 13th birthday, ‚Äúand that opened up the whole world.‚Äù The book \\"Arrowsmith\\" by Sinclair Lewis heavily influenced the young Benzer, and he even imitated the handwriting of Max Gottlieb, a scientist character in the novel. Benzer graduated from New Utrecht High School at 15 years old. In 1938 he enrolled at Brooklyn College where he majored in physics. Benzer then moved on to Purdue University to earn his Ph.D. in solid state physics. While there he was recruited for a secret military project to develop improved radar. He performed research that led to the development of stable germanium rectifiers and discovered a germanium crystal able to be used at high voltages, among the scientific work that led to the first transistor. =Personal life= At Brooklyn College, as a sixteen-year-old freshman, Benzer met Dorothy Vlosky (nicknamed Dotty), a twenty-one-year-old nurse. He later married her in New York City in 1942. They had two daughters, Barbie (Barbara) and Martha Jane. Benzer died of a stroke at the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, California. Scientific career =Molecular biology= Upon receiving his Ph.D. in 1947, he was immediately hired as an assistant professor in physics at Purdue. However, Benzer was inspired by Erwin Schr√∂dinger's book What Is Life?, in which the physicist pondered the physical nature of the gene and a ‚Äúcode‚Äù of life. This catalyzed Benzer's shift in interest to biology, and he moved into the area of bacteriophage genetics., spending two years as a postdoctoral fellow in Max Delbr√ºck's laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and then returning to Purdue. At Purdue University, Benzer developed the T4 rII system, a new genetic technique involving recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants. After observing that a particular rII mutant, a mutation that caused the bacteriophage to eliminate bacteria more rapidly than usual, was not exhibiting the expected phenotype, it occurred to Benzer that this strain might have come from a cross between two different rII mutants (each having part of the rII gene intact) wherein a recombination event resulted in a normal rII sequence. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, one could create a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes. Taking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Benzer also proved that mutations were distributed in many different parts of a single gene, and the resolving power of his system allowed him to discern mutants that differ at the level of a single nucleotide. Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations. Benzer's work influenced many other scientists of his time (see Phage group). In his molecular biology period, Benzer dissected the fine structure of a single gene, laying down the ground work for decades of mutation analysis and genetic engineering, and setting up a paradigm using the rII phage that would later be used by Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner to establish the triplet code of DNA. In addition, Benzer's mapping technique was taken up by Richard Feynman. In 1967, Benzer left the field of phage genetics and returned to the California Institute of Technology to work in behavioral genetics. =Behavioral genetics= Benzer vs. Hirsch Benzer was one of the first scientists to rise to prominence in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field's leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch. While Hirsch believed that behaviors were complex phenomena irreducible to the level of single genes, Benzer advocated that animal behaviors were not too complex to be directed by a single gene. This translated to methodological differences in the two researchers' experiments with Drosophila that profoundly influenced the field of behavioral genetics. Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer primarily used forward genetic mutagenesis screens to isolate mutants for a particular behavior. Benzer and Hirsch's competing philosophies served to provide necessary scientific tension in order to accelerate and enhance developments in behavioral genetics, helping it gain traction as a legitimate area of study in the scientific community. Research accomplishments Benzer used forward genetics to investigate the genetic basis of various behaviors such as phototaxis, circadian rhythms, and learning by inducing mutations in a Drosophila population and then screening individuals for altered phenotypes of interest. To better identify mutants, Benzer developed novel apparatuses such as the countercurrent device, which was designed to separate flies according to the magnitude and direction of their phototactic response. Benzer identified mutants for a wide variety of characteristics: vision (nonphototactic, negative phototactic, and eyes absent), locomotion (sluggish, uncoordinated), stress sensitivity (freaked- out), sexual function (savoir-faire, fruitless), nerve and muscle function (photoreceptor degeneration, drop-dead), and learning and memory (rutabaga, dunce). Benzer and student Ron Konopka discovered the first circadian rhythm mutants. Three distinct mutant types‚Äîarrhythmic, shortened period, and lengthened period‚Äîwere identified. These mutations all involved the same functional gene on the X chromosome and influenced the eclosion rhythm of the population as well as rhythms in individual flies' locomotor activity. To monitor Drosophila locomotor activity, Benzer and postdoctoral researcher, Yoshiki Hotta, designed a system using infrared light and solar cells. All three mutations were mapped to the X chromosome, zero centimorgans away from each other, indicating that the mutant phenotypes corresponded to alleles of the same gene, which Konopka named period. This was the first of several seminal studies of single genes affecting behavior, studies that have been replicated in other animal models and are now the basis for the growing field of molecular biology of behavior. In 1992 Benzer, working with Michael Rosbash, furthered this work by showing that the PER protein, which period codes for, is predominantly located in the nucleus. The work with Period mutants was catalytic in the study of circadian rhythms and served to propel the field forward. On 2 October 2017, Dr. Rosbash, along with Drs. Michael W. Young and Jeffrey C. Hall, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition of their cloning of circadian rhythm genes, and the elucidation of the biochemical mechanisms by which the circadian rhythm protein products regulated behavior. Benzer was at the forefront of the study of neurodegeneration in fruit flies, modeling human diseases and attempting to suppress them. He also contributed to the field of aging biology, looking for mutants with altered longevity and trying to dissect the mechanisms by which an organism can escape the inevitable functional downfall and its associated diseases. In 1998, Benzer and his colleagues Yi-Jyun Lin and Laurent Seroude published findings of a long-life mutant in Drosophila, then named Methuselah. The mutant gene coded for a previously unknown member of the GPCR family. By testing against temperature stress, it is thought that these mutants have an increased ability to respond to stress and thus to live longer. One of Benzer's final research projects was on dietary restriction and longevity research. A paper was published, in Cell, on the longevity effect of 4E-BP, a translational repressor, following dietary restriction. Although the research was done before his death, the paper was published afterwards and dedicated to his memory. =Cancer research= In 1978, Dotty was in the hospital with breast cancer, and Seymour's friend, colleague, and mentor Max Delbr√ºck was diagnosed with cancer. Consequently, Seymour Benzer took interest in cancer biology and attended several conferences on breast cancer. Benzer later remarried with Carol Miller, a neuropathologist. Together, in the early 1980s, they used antibody staining techniques to find nearly identical genes between flies and humans.

History The house of Orangeville founder Orange Lawrence as it stands today. Businesses on Broadway through downtown Orangeville Territory of the Pet√∫n (Tionontati) people. The first patent of land was issued to Ezekiel Benson, a land surveyor, on August 7, 1820. That was followed by land issued to Alan Robinet in 1822. In 1863, Orangeville was named after Orange Lawrence, a businessman born in Connecticut in 1796 who owned several mills in the village. As a young man, he moved to Canada and settled in Halton County. During Mackenzie's rebellion in 1837, he was a captain in the militia. Lawrence purchased the land that became Orangeville from Robert Hughson.Source: The Orangeville Banner, March 8, 1951 He settled in the area in 1844 and established a mille. The post office dates from 1851. Orange Lawrence committed suicide December 15, 1861. In 1873, the Act of Incorporation was passed and Orangeville was given town status on January 1, 1874. The public library, located at Broadway and Mill Street, was completed in 1908. Andrew Carnegie, well-known businessman and philanthropist, provided financial assistance for its construction. Economy Orangeville serves as an administrative and commercial hub for Dufferin County, the northern portion of Peel Region, and the surrounding area. Orangeville's downtown core is home to a substantial number of retail stores, and there is a cluster of big-box stores in the Fairgrounds Shopping Centre. Many residents in and around Orangeville also commute to different areas of the Greater Toronto Area for work. There are a number of manufacturing plants located in the town. Major industrial employers include Greening Donald (automotive airbag components), Resolve Corporation (computer outsourcing), Clorox Company of Canada (Glad garbage bags), Relizon Canada (pressure-sensitive labels), Rochling Engineering Plastics (formerly Symplastics Limited) (plastic sheets) and Sanoh Canada (automotive components). Orangeville is also the main banking center for residents in the area. Transportation Orangeville Town Hall. The main intersection in the heart of the town is Broadway (formerly Ontario Highway 9) and First Street. Highway 10 runs through Orangeville on its east side. Beginning in 2005, a major roadwork project was initiated to resurface Broadway through Orangeville. The downtown section was completed in early 2006, with extensive work still to be done on the west end in late 2006. In conjunction with this project, there was another one completed in late 2006 that involved building large planters in the middle of Broadway through the downtown section between First and Third Streets (West - East). The project was controversial, as safety concerns had been raised by the Fire Department because the new concrete planters in the middle of the road have made the rights of way too narrow for fire trucks to properly set up in case of a fire in a downtown building. Construction of the South Arterial Road, often referred to as the 'Orangeville by-pass', was completed on August 3, 2005. The road runs from east to west, connecting Highway 10 and County Road 109 (formerly Highway 9). Much of the eastern stretch runs through the Town of Caledon, but officially enters into Orangeville at the Townline Road controlled intersection. Aecon Construction and Materials Limited was the successful bidder for the Design Build project with a price of $9.8 million. The project was completed in conjunction with Brampton-based Armbro Construction, TSH Engineers Architects Planners, Peto MacCallum Ltd. and Gartner Lee Ltd. Orangeville Transit is the town's own public transit system, and there is a commuter GO Transit bus service to Brampton. In the early 1990s, preliminary plans were drawn up for GO Transit rail service to Orangeville. However, it never got past the drawing board. Industries in Orangeville are served by the Orangeville Brampton Railway, which purchased of surplus track from the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway connects with the CPR in Streetsville, and also services customers in Brampton to the south. From 2004 to 2018, a tourist train was operated on weekends in summer months. In 1906, survey work was underway for an electric railway line which would serve Orangeville, to be called the Huron and Ontario Electric Railway. Demographics According to the 2016 Canadian Census, the population of Orangeville is 28,900, a 3.3% increase from 2011, with a per annum average growth rate over the same period. The area is , giving a population density of . The median age is 38.8 years, lower than the national median age of 41.2 years. There are 10,696 private dwellings with an occupancy rate of 98.8%. According to the 2015 National Household Survey, the median value of a dwelling in Orangeville is $400,320, higher than the national average at $341,556. The median household income (after-taxes) in Orangeville is $73,605, higher than the national median of $61,348. Orangeville inhabitants are predominantly of European descent. The racial composition of Orangeville is: :* 91.1% White :* 2.0% Black :* 1.9% Aboriginal; 1.3% First Nations, 0.5% M√©tis :* 1.4% South Asian :* 1.3% Southeast Asian; 1.0% Filipino :* 0.6% East Asian; 0.3% Chinese, 0.2% Korean, 0.07% Japanese :* 0.6% Latin American :* 0.16% West Asian :* 0.14% Arab :* 0.5% Multiracial :* 0.2% Other Education Upper Grand District School Board operates secular anglophone public schools. The Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board operates anglophone catholic public schools. The Conseil scolaire Viamonde operates secular francophone schools serving the area. The Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre- Sud operates catholic francophone schools serving the area. There are currently eleven public and separate elementary schools in Orangeville: Credit Meadows, Mono Amaranth, Montgomery Village, Parkinson Centennial, Princess Elizabeth, Princess Margaret, St. Andrew's RC, St. Benedict's RC, St. Peter's RC, Island Lake Public School and Spencer Avenue Elementary. Along with these publicly funded schools, there are several private schools in the area: Headwater Hills Montessori School, Dufferin Area Christian School, Hillcrest Private School, The Maples Independent Country School, Orangeville Christian School. A French elementary school named L'√âcole √©l√©mentaire de Quatre-rivi√®rs (translated as \\"Four Rivers Elementary School\\") currently resides in the old Springbrook Elementary building despite the reason for closing the school being 'structural' problems. Most of these problems are said to be the result of 'improper foundation for the area' as the school was built upon a swamp. It had been used as a holding school for other schools including Island Lake, Montgomery Village, and Princess Margaret, while repairs, renovations, rebuilds and construction were completed. There are two secondary schools within the boundaries of Orangeville: Westside Secondary School and Orangeville District Secondary School (ODSS). A catholic secondary school Robert F. Hall Catholic Secondary School draws around 1000 students from Orangeville and the rest of the county despite being within the Region of Peel. Humber College has offered full-time programs at the Alder Street arena since 2007. In 2019, the collage announced it would be closing the campus in June 2021. Georgian College currently owns and operates a campus offering full & part-time courses located at 22 Centennial Road. It is also delivering Employment programs and services out of a location on 51 Townline. Culture Built c.1871, the town hall contains the opera hall Statue of Santa Claus in Kay Cee Gardens, other wooden statues can be seen throughout the town. Orangeville hosts the annual Orangeville Blues and Jazz Festival, usually in June. The Town Hall building contains the historic Orangeville Opera House on the second floor. The building was restored in 1993-1994. This facility is the home base of professional theatre company Theatre Orangeville, and hosts plays and concerts throughout the year. Begun in 2003, Orangeville's Art Walk of Tree Sculptures features more than 50 detailed works by local artists. The sculptures are carved from old maple trees that have died from natural causes. The largest tree sculpture is a tribute to Canadiana and the centrepiece of a small newly-developed park. It is a story totem entitled Nature's Unity, and celebrates Canada's 150th birthday. Sports The Orangeville Flyers were a junior 'A' ice hockey team and part of the Ontario Junior Hockey League. They played home games at the Alder Street Recreation Facility until moving to Brampton in 2018. Orangeville was also home to a professional basketball team, the Orangeville A's of the National Basketball League of Canada, who played at the Orangeville Athlete Institute. The Athlete Institute Academy is home to Orangeville Prep, which has produced two top-10 NBA draft picks. The Orangeville Northmen junior A and B box lacrosse teams are based in Orangeville. Media There are two local newspapers based in Orangeville, the Orangeville Citizen and the Orangeville Banner. Two radio stations originate from Orangeville, adult contemporary CKMO-FM (MyFM 101.5) and rhythmic contemporary CIDC-FM (Z103.5), although the latter station has historically targeted the broader Greater Toronto Area and Toronto as a rimshot (having moved its tower closer to the city, and operating from studios in Etobicoke) rather than operate as an Orangeville-specific outlet, and has faced orders from the CRTC requesting that the station regularly broadcast more news and information content of specific relevance to Orangeville. CKMO, which launched in 2015, does specifically target Orangeville. Until June 2005, Rogers Television maintained its Peel North studio and production facility at 98 C-Line. The facility was closed to allow for expansion of the Peel North headend. Government and politics Orangeville is located in provincial electoral district of Dufferin‚ÄîCaledon. This was changed from Dufferin‚ÄîPeel‚ÄîWellington‚ÄîGrey when the Province instituted the 107 electoral districts revision in 2006. Its current Member of Provincial Parliament is Sylvia Jones, former assistant to Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader, John Tory.

Life  Kilvert was born on 3 December 1840 at The Rectory, Hardenhuish Lane, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, to the Rev. Robert Kilvert, rector of Langley Burrell, Wiltshire, and Thermuthis, daughter of Walter Coleman and Thermuthis Ashe. He was educated privately in Bath by his uncle, Francis Kilvert, before going up to Wadham College, Oxford. He then entered the Church of England and became a rural curate, working primarily in the Welsh Marches between Hereford and Hay on Wye. Initially, from 1863 to 1864, he was curate to his father at Langley Burrell, and in 1865 he became curate of Clyro, Radnorshire. There on 1 January 1870 he started a diary from which it appears that he basked in his life within the Welsh countryside, often writing several pages describing his surroundings and the parishioners that he visited. In late 1871 he fell in love with Frances Eleanor Jane Thomas, the youngest daughter of the vicar of Llanigon, a parish not far from Clyro, and asked her father for permission to marry her. Because of Kilvert's position as a lowly curate, Frances' father looked unfavourably on the request and refused it. After receiving this rejection Kilvert wrote in his diary that \\"The sun seemed to have gone out of the sky\\". Frances, who was referred to as Daisy in the diaries, would die a spinster in December 1928. Shortly after the rejection, in 1872, Kilvert resigned his position as curate of Clyro, and left the village, returning to his father's parish of Langley Burrell. From 1876 to 1877 he was vicar of St Harmon, Radnorshire, and from 1877 to his death in 1879 he was vicar of Bredwardine, Herefordshire. In August 1879 he married Elizabeth Ann Rowland (1846‚Äì1911), whom he had met on a visit to Paris, but he died from peritonitis on 23 September, aged 38, a few days after returning from his honeymoon in Scotland. He was buried at Bredwardine.  Diaries  Kilvert is best known as the author of voluminous diaries describing rural life. After his death, his diaries were edited and censored, possibly by his widow. Later they were passed on to William Plomer who transcribed the remaining diaries and edited and published a three-volume selection Selections from the Diary of the Rev. Francis Kilvert (Jonathan Cape, Vol I: 1870‚Äì1871 pub. 1938, Vol II: 1871‚Äì1874 pub.1939, Vol III: 1874‚Äì1879 pub.1940), and later a one-volume selection Kilvert's Diary, 1870‚Äì1879 (Jonathan Cape, 1944‚Äîcorrected in 1960, and with an abridged and illustrated version for children published as Ardizzone's Kilvert in 1976). Published just before and during World War II, the first editions of the diaries were well received by the public when, in a period of bombing and rationing they provided an escapism back to the simpler and happier times of the mid Victorian era, still just within living memory. A different selection from Plomer's abridgemant was published as Journal of a Country Curate: Selections from the Diary of Francis Kilvert by The Folio Society in 1960. In 1992 a new selection was published under the editorship of David Lockwood, Kilvert, the Victorian: A New Selection from Kilvert's Diaries (Seren Books, 1992). Out of print since 1970, the three-volume indexed edition was reprinted in 2006 by O'Donoghue Books. In the 1950s, whilst Plomer was contemplating further publication of the remaining journals, it was found that the majority of the surviving diaries had been destroyed by their then owner; an elderly niece of Kilvert's, who claimed to have done so to protect \\"private family matters.\\" This had occurred during a clear out of various personal papers, prior to moving into a residential care home. When confronted by this information Plomer was said to have recalled he \\"could have strangled her with his bare hands.\\" Only the three volumes listed below survived, which the said niece gave to other people. Plomer's own transcription was destroyed by fire in the Blitz. Despite Kilvert's niece's actions she ironically was a Vice- President, and an avid member of the Kilvert Society for many years up until her death in 1964. Francis Kilvert also published pleasant but conventional poetry, republished by the Kilvert Society in Collected verse : 3rd December 1840 - 23rd September 1879 by the Reverend Francis Kilvert in 1968. The Cornish Diary: Journal No.4, 1870‚ÄîFrom 19 July to 6 August, Cornwall was published by Alison Hodge in 1989. The National Library of Wales, which holds two of the three surviving volumes, published The Diary of Francis Kilvert: April‚ÄìJune 1870 in 1982 and The Diary of Francis Kilvert: June‚ÄìJuly 1870 in 1989. A new edition of the abridged 1944 Diary was published in 2019 by Vintage Classics to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Kilvert starting his diary, which fell in January 2020. It includes a recently discovered photograph of Kilvert and a new introduction by Mark Bostridge. Nudism Kilvert was an enthusiast for public bathing in the nude, which he regarded as natural and healthy. The first entry in Kilvert's diaries in which he records his naked bathing was for 4 September 1872, at Weston-super-Mare. He writes: \\"Bathing in the morning before breakfast from a machine. Many people were openly stripping on the sands a little further on and running down into the sea and I would have done the same but I had brought down no towels of my own\\". However, next day Kilvert joins in the fun: \\"I was out early before breakfast this morning bathing from the sands. There was a delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea where the waves were curling white with foam and the red morning sunshine glowing upon the naked limbs of the bathers\\".Kilvert Society Newsletter March 1979 Relationships with girls Several modern writers have commented on passages in the diaries describing interactions with young girls which these days might raise suspicions of paedophilia.  Modern adaptations  A John Betjeman documentary on Kilvert, Vicar of this Parish, was shown on BBC television in 1976. This led to Kilvert's Diary being dramatised (eighteen 15-minute episodes) on British television between 1977 and 1978, with Timothy Davies in the title role. The diaries were dramatised on BBC Radio 4 (five episodes) in December 2019.

Chaand Raat is a time of celebration when families and friends gather in open areas at the end of the last day of Ramadan to spot the new moon, which signals the arrival of the Islamic month of Shawwal and the day of Eid. Once the moon is sighted, people wish each other Chaand Raat Mubarak (\\"Have a blessed night of the new moon\\") or Eid Mubarak (\\"Blessings of the Eid day\\"). Women and girls decorate their hands with mehndi (henna), and people prepare desserts for the next day of Eid and do last rounds of shopping. City streets have a festive look, and brightly decorated malls and markets remain open late into the night. Chaand Raat is celebrated festively and passionately by Muslims (and occasionally non-Muslims as well) all over South Asia, and in socio-cultural significance, is comparable to Christmas Eve. Etymology Hyderabad, India The term is derived from the Sanskrit words candr√° (‡§ö‡§Ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞) \\"moon\\" and rƒÅÃÅtri (‡§∞‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø) \\"night\\". Background Chaand Raat celebrations occur on the eve of Eid ul- Fitr, which is celebrated on 1 Shawwal. The beginning of an Islamic month depends on the first sighting of the lunar crescent and thus the month of Ramadan can be of either 29 or 30 days. The new moon is announced by the Ruet- e-Hilal Committee and Chaand Raat occurs on the same evening (on which first lunar crescent of the month of Shawwal is observed). As the exact day of Eid ul-Fitr is dependent on the moon sighting, Chaand Raat is considered more festive on Eid ul-Fitr than Eid ul-Adha, which is known well in advance. Festivities As soon as the Ruet-e-Hilal Committee announces the sighting of the new moon, announcements are made from mosques, television channels and radio stations. Festivities begin almost instantly and continue all night until the morning Fajr prayer. Entire families head out towards the local bazaars, markets and shopping malls. Women usually purchase items such as Shalwar Kameez, bangles, jewellery and bags while men mostly concentrate on shoes. Gifts and sweets are brought for friends while toys are brought for children. Barbar shops and beauty parlors are also heavily visited in the evening in preparation for the following day. Women and girls decorate their hands with mehndi as well. Decorative lights are put up in markets as well as government buildings, banks and mosques. Chaand Raat also gives a chance for people to meet with friends and extended family.

Financial markets The main stock exchange operators in the Australian financial market are the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the smaller National Stock Exchange of Australia (NSX), both of which provide stock exchange facilities for Australian listed securities. NSX acquired the Bendigo Stock Exchange in June 2012 and merged its operations. Most foreign exchange transactions are largely free from regulation, and the Reserve Bank of Australia has largely delegated its control to authorised money market dealers and foreign exchange dealers.  Market participants  Total employment in the finance industry (thousands of people) since 1984 Participants in the financial system consist of commercial banks, investment banks, finance companies, building or cooperative societies, credit unions, friendly societies, non bank financial institutions (NBFI), superannuation and approved deposit funds, public unit trusts, cash management trusts, mortgage originators, insurance companies, institutional funds investing in and financing debt. =Financial institutions= Banking in Australia is dominated by what are known as the \\"big four\\", which are also referred to as the pillars of Australia's financial system: * Commonwealth Bank of Australia (Commbank) * Westpac Banking Corporation (Westpac) * Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) * National Australia Bank (NAB) There are several smaller banks with a presence throughout the country, and a large number of other financial institutions, such as credit unions. Many large foreign banks have a presence, but few have a retail banking presence. The central bank is the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Since 2008 the Australian government has guaranteed deposits up to $250,000 per customer per institution against banking failure. =Insurance market= Australia's insurance market can be divided into roughly three components: life insurance, general insurance and health insurance. These markets have been fairly distinct, with most larger insurers focusing on only one type. However, in recent times several insurance companies have broadened their scope into more general financial services, and have faced competition from banks and subsidiaries of foreign financial conglomerates. =Superannuation= Superannuation in Australia is government-supported and encouraged, and minimum provisions are compulsory for employees. Superannuation arrangements are provided by banks and insurance companies, though most funds are self-managed. Superannuation funds are tightly regulated. Payments and clearing systems There are several payment systems in use within Australia, many of which are regulated by Australian Payments Network (AusPayNet) (previously called Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA)), including: = Cash = The Australian dollar is Australia‚Äôs currency and legal tender in Australia. Clearing and settling of cash payments (also called CS5) are regulated by AusPayNet as the Australian Cash Distribution Exchange System (ACDES).Australian Cash Distribution and Exchange System Framework (CS5), Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited: accessed 26 July 2015 = Cheques = Cheques are still the most important non-cash payment instruments in Australia, in terms of the value transferred. The number of monthly cheque transactions in 2008 was 33.7 million with a value of $139.3 billion.Cheque Payment Transactions (Monthly volume and value) Cheque use is in decline worldwide, but it is declining faster in Australia than many other countries. Between 2010 and 2014, cheque use in Australia declined by 42.8% with just over seven cheques written per person in 2014. In 2014, 166.6 million cheques were used in Australia, compared to 291.1 million in 2010.Bank for International Settlements, quoted in Australian Payments Clearing Association, Towards a digital economy, p.5 In 2015, cheque usage fell by a further 16.3%. Cheques and other payment instruments (such as travellers cheques and warrants) (also called CS1) are cleared and settled in accordance with the regulations and procedures set by APCS.Procedures for Australian Paper Clearing System Framework (CS1), Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited: accessed 26 July 2015 Cheques use MICR encoding containing the BSB and account number to identify the bank and account to debit, as well as other information to streamline the processing of cheques. In 2014, the cost of processing cheques was the highest of all modes of payments at $5 per transaction, compared to about $0.20 for direct debits.Reserve Bank of Australia, quoted in Australian Payments Clearing Association, Towards a digital economy, p.6 A recent innovation has been digital cheque imaging, which involves images of cheques being captured by financial institutions and exchanged electronically between the relevant financial institutions rather than the previous costly practice of physically transporting paper cheques around Australia. This has also ended the need for maintaining long-term storage and retrieval systems. The new system speeds up the clearing process, with cheques being able to be cleared at the end of the next weekday after being presented, as opposed to up to the six weekdays under the old system. = Direct entry = Direct entry (also called CS2)Procedures for Bulk Electronic Clearing System Framework (CS2), Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited: accessed 26 July 2015 can be used to transfer funds between bank accounts in Australia. Clearing and settling is regulated by AusPayNet as the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS). Direct entry uses the BSB and account number to identify the bank and accounts to debit and credit. Some common uses of the direct entry system include: * setting up monthly direct debits to pay recurring bills such as credit card bills * transferring funds to other bank accounts, also known as third party transfers * payment of wages and salaries * government tax refunds and payments. Participants of BECS exchange direct entry (DE) files at intervals through the day. Net positions are usually cleared daily. = EFTPOS = EFTPOS (Electronic Fund Transfer Point of Sale) and ATM transactions (also called CS3)Regulations for Consumer Electronic Clearing System Framework (CS3), Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited: accessed 26 July 2015 occur over the EFT network. Clearing and settling of EFTPOS and ATM transactions are regulated by the AusPayNet as the Consumer Electronic Clearing System (CECS). Between 2005 and 2015, ATM withdrawals dropped by 11.5% but increased 5.1% in value. = Credit card = Several credit card systems are active in Australia including MasterCard, Visa, Diners Club and American Express. The Bankcard scheme is no longer in use. = BPAY = BPAY is a bill payment system used in Australia, which is regulated by the four major banks and not by AusPayNet. As of January 2015, the BPAY payments system covered more than 156 participating Australian banks, credit unions and financial institutions. More than 45,000 businesses accept payments using BPAY and each month approximately 30 million bills are paid to the value of $24 billion.About BPAY, Overview. Retrieved January 2015 = High value payments = High value payments (also known as CS4) are regulated by AusPayNet under the Regulations for High Value Clearing System Framework.Regulations for High Value Clearing System Framework (CS4), Australian Payments Clearing Association Limited: accessed 26 July 2015 The main high value payment systems in Australia are: * Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication Payment Delivery System (SWIFT PDS) * Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS): CHESS is an automated share transfer and settlement system developed by the Australian Securities Exchange. For a CHESS transaction, an interbank request is sent to RITS via SWIFT FIN, the service which sends financial information from one financial institution to another.What is SWIFT-FIN message? When RITS notifies CHESS of settlement of the gross amount across ESAs, CHESS finalises the transaction by transferring share holdings at the participant level. * Financial Transactions Recording and Clearance System (FINTRACS) * Reserve Bank Information and Transfer System (RITS) is used by banks and other approved institutions to settle their payment obligations on a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) basis. Final and irrevocable settlement is achieved by the simultaneous crediting and debiting of Exchange Settlement Accounts (ESAs) held at the Reserve Bank. = New Payments Platform = The New Payments Platform (NPP) is open access infrastructure for fast payments in Australia. The NPP was developed via industry collaboration to enable households, businesses and government agencies to make simply addressed payments, with near real-time funds availability to the recipient, on a 24/7 basis. Each payment message is capable of carrying much richer remittance information than other systems. The NPP infrastructure supports the independent development of ‚Äòoverlay‚Äô services to offer innovative payment services to end-users. Regulation Regulation of the financial system in Australia is split mainly between the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). ASIC has responsibility for market integrity and consumer protection and the regulation of certain financial institutions (including investment banks and finance companies or NBFI). The general regulatory position is that a legal person carrying on a financial services business in Australia must either hold an Australian financial services licence issued to that person by ASIC or fall within a licensing exemption. APRA is responsible for the licensing and prudential supervision of ADIs (banks, building societies, credit unions, friendly societies and participants in certain credit card schemes and certain purchaser payment facilities), life and general insurance companies and superannuation funds. APRA has issued capital adequacy guidelines for banks which are consistent with the Basel II guidelines. All financial institutions regulated by APRA are required to report on a periodic basis to APRA. Certain financial intermediaries, such as investment banks (which do not otherwise operate as ADIs) are neither licensed nor regulated under the Banking Act and are not subject to the prudential supervision of APRA. They may be required to obtain licences under the Corporations Act 2001 or other Commonwealth or state legislation, depending on the nature of their business activities in Australia. Most investment banks are registered under the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001. This Act requires registered financial corporations to provide statistical information to APRA. The Reserve Bank of Australia is the country's central bank, with responsibility for most payment systems and setting of monetary policy. Since 1996 the provision of credit to individuals for personal, household or domestic purposes has been regulated by the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, which has been implemented in all Australian states and territories. Businesses providing financial products and services are required to identify and monitor customers using a risk-based approach, develop and maintain a compliance program, report suspicious matters and certain cash transactions and file annual compliance reports.See Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Commonwealth). * Australian Competition and Consumer Commission * Australian Securities Exchange * Australian Payments Network See also * Economy of Australia * Banking in Australia *Non bank financial institutions in Australia  Notes and references  ","title":"Financial system in Australia"},{"id":"1214842","text":"The Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction is an annual prize awarded by the University of Georgia Press named in honor of the American short story writer and novelist Flannery O'Connor.

He later served as 28th Prime Minister of Romania. Transylvanian politics Vaida-Voevod was born to a Greek-Catholic family in the Transylvanian village of Alpar√©t, Austria-Hungary (, today Bob√¢lna, Romania). Initially, Voevod was supportive of a plan to federalize the domains of the Habsburgs along the lines of a United States of Greater Austria, and was close to Archduke Franz Ferdinand. In 1906, Vaida-Voevod joined a group of Romanian nationalists in the Budapest Parliament (the Romanian National Party of Transylvania and Banat), becoming an important opponent of the Hungarian governmental policy of Magyarization, and fought for the right of Transylvania to self-determination. Disappointed by the Austrian cause after Franz Ferdinand's assassination in Sarajevo, and turned towards an advocacy of Transylvania's union with Romania. =Union with Romania= In October 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points were published in the German press. While in his native village of Olpret, Vaida-Voevod read about the Wilsonian principles in a newspaper from Munich, which made him realize that instead of demanding the federalization of Austria-Hungary, the only valid alternative was to push towards the union with the Romanian Kingdom. He drafted quickly a proposal in that respect and went to his good friend Iuliu Hossu in Gherla to seek his advice. Pondering over the words in the draft, they decided to replace the most radical proposal with the following generic statement: \\"Starting now, whatever the Great Powers will decide, the Romanian nation from Hungary and Transylvania is determined to rather perish than to endure slavery and subjugation any further\\". On 18 October 1918, Vaida-Voevod presented this proposal in the Hungarian Diet, asking for the right to self- determination of the Romanians in Hungary. He began his discourse in a dull tone, then he suddenly read the declaration of self-determination, to the shock of his fellow deputies, who started to throw objects at him. Having prepared his exit in advance, Vaida-Voevod narrowly escaped lynching by leaving quickly through a back door of the Parliament building and hiding in a workers' neighborhood in Budapest, where many ethnic Romanians lived. In December 1918, after the Aster Revolution when Hungary had become a republic, Vaida-Voevod was elected in the Alba Iulia National Assembly that proclaimed the union with Romania, and was, alongside Vasile Goldi»ô, Iuliu Hossu, and Miron Cristea, a member of the Transylvanian group of envoys that presented the decision to King Ferdinand I in Bucharest. In Romania Vaida-Voevod on a 2018 stamp of Romania Vaida-Voevod joined the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and was one of its most prominent members throughout the negotiations, as an organizer of press campaigns. During the conference, he joined the Masonic Grand Orient de France in order to secure a more advantageous position for his country. Remus Florescu, \\"Alexandru Vaida Voevod a intrat √Æn masonerie pentru a ajuta Rom√¢nia la Conferin≈£a de Pace de la Paris din 1919\\", AdevƒÉrul, 7 November 2013; accessed 10 November 2013 =First Term as Prime Minister= The elections of November 1919 were successful for his party, and Vaida-Voevod replaced the National Liberal Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu as Prime Minister and Nicolae Mi»ôu as Foreign Minister. He secured the demarcation lines by ordering Romanian troops to fight off the Hungarian Soviet Republic. However, Vaida-Voevod's radical approach toward the land reforms made King Ferdinand dissolve his government in March 1920, to be replaced by one formed by General Alexandru Averescu's People's Party (a populist movement that had attracted BrƒÉtianu's conditional support). Vaida- Voevod's party emerged as the National Peasants' Party in 1926, and he served as its leader. He also served twice as Interior Minister (1928‚Äì1930 and 1932). =Second and Third Cabinet= Bust of Vaida-Voevod in Cluj-Napoca Vaida- Voevod's second cabinet existed from 11 August until 17 October 1932; he resigned and was succeeded by Iuliu Maniu. After Maniu resigned as Prime Minister in January 1933, Vaida-Voevod returned as Prime Minister. \\"Vaida and his supporters, who formed the National Peasants' Party's right wing, were acting more like Liberals than Peasantists. They crushed strikes by oil workers in Ploie»ôti and by railway workers in Bucharest in February 1933, dissolved Communist Party front organizations and all other 'anti-state' organizations, and proclaimed martial law in a number of cities.\\" Nonetheless, the problems posed by his new cabinets (in 1932 and 1933) ‚Äì the Legionary Movement's intimidation of the political scene, and Vaida-Voevod's own anti- semitism (which began to manifest itself in measures of repression encouraged by the Legionaries), led to a split between the Prime Minister and his Party. His second government fell because of Armand CƒÉlinescu, who was a staunch opponent of the Legionary Movement. Later On 25 February 1935, Vaida- Voevod created his own movement, the Romanian Front, which survived through the increasingly authoritarian regime of King Carol II, the National Legionary State, Ion Antonescu's regime and most of World War II. It was dissolved after King Michael's Coup of August 1944, when the Romanian Communist Party started gaining influence with Soviet backing. Nevertheless, the party never eluded obscurity in front of competition from the Legionaries, and its members were victims of the repression carried out by the communist regime after 1948. Vaida-Voevod was arrested on 24 March 1945. In 1946, he was put under house arrest in Sibiu, where he spent the remainder of his life.

Life G√∂tting was born in Nietleben, in the Prussian Province of Saxony, today part of Halle/Saale. During World War II, he served in the Reichsarbeitsdienst, an auxiliary support and supply organization, and later in the Wehrmacht. He was briefly held as a prisoner of war by US forces in 1945. In 1946, G√∂tting joined the East German Christian Democratic Union, a Christian-democratic party. He then spent two years at the Martin Luther University of Halle, where he studied German studies, history and philology. In 1949, G√∂tting became General Secretary of the CDU and, after the establishment in the Soviet Zone of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was elected as a member of the People's Chamber (Volkskammer), the East German legislative body, in which he served for the next forty years. A loyal supporter of the Communist Socialist Unity Party, G√∂tting helped push out those CDU members not willing to do the SED's bidding in the 1950s. Over the years, G√∂tting came to hold a number of influential positions within the East German state: from 1949 to 1963, he served as the Chairman of the CDU faction in the People's Chamber; from 1958 to 1963 as Deputy Prime Minister of the GDR; and from 1963 to November 1989 G√∂tting served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of State, a position equivalent in rank to the vice-presidency of the GDR. G√∂tting also served as Chairman of the People's Chamber from 1969 to 1976 and as its Vice-Chairman from 1969 to 1989. Finally, G√∂tting was elected Chairman of the CDU at its 1966 party congress. As chairman, he worked closely with the other parties that formed the National Front, the SED-dominated alliance that governed East Germany. During his party leadership, he published brochures exploring the relationship between Christianity and socialism. G√∂tting held a number of other positions in East German society. From 1961 to 1969, G√∂tting was Vice- President of the German-African Society, and from 1963 he was a member of the Albert Schweitzer Committee. He visited with Schweitzer twice, which meetings he recorded and publicized in his book ‚ÄúBegegnungen mit Albert Schweitzer‚Äú. In 1976, G√∂tting was elected Chairman of the People's Friendship League of the GDR. On 2 November 1989, just days before the fall of the Berlin Wall, G√∂tting was forced to resign as Chairman of the CDU. Five days later he stepped down from his position as a member of the Council of State, too. In December G√∂tting was arrested, but released in February 1990. On 19 May 2015 G√∂tting died in Berlin, aged 91.

The centre is operated by Corrective Services NSW an agency of the Department of Attorney General and Justice of the Government of New South Wales. The centre detains sentenced and unsentenced felons under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The current Grafton Gaol complex is the third gaol to be constructed to serve the town of Grafton. Correctional facilities were first established in Grafton in 1862 under the supervision of the Office of the Sheriff accommodating up to 48 inmates. A second complex was established but did not contain the required number of cells, was floodprone and unhygienic. A permanent facility was not established until 1893. During the early 1890s, the design of public buildings was not automatically given to the Government Architect, but was open to competition. Sydney architect Henry Austin Wilshire won the Grafton Gaol competition with a design following trends already evident in the gaols designed by the Colonial Architect. The design consisted of a square compound, with brick walls, with an elaborate gatehouse, featuring a machicolated parapet, a sandstone archway and elaborate panelled doors. The gaol was built by the Holloway Bros. and proclaimed on 8 September 1893. Prisoners were transferred to the new facility in November of the same year. By 1924, the gaol had been reclassified as a maximum security prison; reverted to medium security by about 1945. After 1942, increasing tensions in the state's prisons and a number of serious assaults on prison officers led to Grafton Gaol being used to house the most intractable prisoners. Riots at Bathurst and problems at other correctional facilities during the 1970s resulted in the appointment of Justice John Nagle to conduct a Royal Commission to oversee reforms to the Australian penal system. As best described by Justice Nagle during proceedings of the Nagle Royal Commission (1976-1978): Accepting the Nagle Report in 1978, the Wran Labor government began prison reform under the leadership of Dr Tony Vinson. The Grafton Gaol was officially abolished by proclamation from 18 December 1991, and was converted to a Periodic Detention Centre in the same proclamation. The remaining prisoners were removed and the new centre received its first detainees on 8 May 1992. The gaol's name was changed to the Grafton Correctional Centre. Recent developments Inmates from the centre make padded, waterproof Street Swags, distributed by national charities to alleviate the hardship of homelessness. In June 2010 an inmate was found bleeding to death in his cell. He died several days later in a Brisbane hospital. Serving time for traffic offences, a coronial inquest heard that threats were made against the prisoner's life by his cellmate whose sleep was disturbed by snoring. Prison officials were criticised when CCTV footage revealed that the inmate's calls for help were ignored by prison officers and the officers failed to render first aid. In 2011 there was contention over the future of Grafton Correctional Centre, with some suggesting its closure or privatisation. The women's wing was shut in November 2011, with female inmates transferred to the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre. In June 2012 the O'Farrell government decided to downgrade the facility and the centre now houses up to 64 inmates who are taken into custody or are currently in custody and need to attend court in the Northern Rivers region. The new nearby Clarence Correctional Centre officially opened on 25 July 2020. Historic features Grafton Gaol Complex originally consisted of a square compound, with brick walls, with one elaborate gatehouse providing access for staff, visitors and prisoners alike. The gatehouse features a machicolated parapet, a sandstone archway and elaborate panelled doors. A Range building was constructed within the compound, adjacent to the gatehouse to provide facilities for the prison officers and visitors. A sterile zone separated the cell ranges from the prison walls. Male and female prisoners were completely segregated with separate cell ranges, exercise yards, bath houses and hospital facilities. The (former) male cell range is largely intact. Workshop and kitchen facilities were incorporated in a new range adjacent to the male cell block. The Prison Governor's residence (now Administration block) was located outside the compound wall, adjacent to the main gatehouse. This building features polychromatic brickwork, tuck pointing and some sandstone detailing. Brick, with a sandstone trim and terracotta tiles, all characteristic materials of the Federation period, were used throughout the complex, the level of detail depending on the function of the building. The complex has been extended to one side. New watch towers have been built however elements of the original towers remain intact.  Heritage listing  The Grafton Gaol complex is significant as it demonstrates the development of the philosophy regarding prison architecture in NSW and the confinement of prisoners in the late nineteenth century. It is one of few gaol complexes designed by private architects in Australia. It is one of few known examples of the work of Henry Wiltshire. It continues the features of gaol design developed by the Colonial (later Government) Architects branch. It is one of the few public buildings designed by competition in the late nineteenth century; its design utilises characteristic materials of the Federation period. Its construction is related to the growth and expansion of Grafton. Grafton Correctional Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

He was professor of international law at the University of G√∂ttingen (1783‚Äì89), a state councilor of Westphalia (1808‚Äì13), and the representative of the King of Hanover in the German Confederal diet of Frankfurt upon Main (1816‚Äì21). also known as Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (–§—ë–¥–æ—Ä –§—ë–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ú–∞—Ä—Ç–µ–Ω—Å) in Russian and Fr√©d√©ric Frommhold (de) Martens in French ( ‚Äì ) was a diplomat and jurist in service of the Russian Empire who made important contributions to the science of international law. He represented Russia at the Hague Peace Conferences (during which he drafted the Martens Clause) and helped to settle the first cases of international arbitration, notably the dispute between France and the United Kingdom over Newfoundland. As a scholar, he is probably best remembered today for having edited 15 volumes of Russian international treaties (1874‚Äì1909).

He lost both parents at the age of nine and was sent to a Lutheran orphanage in St. Petersburg, where he successfully completed the full course of studies at a German high school and in 1863 entered the law faculty of St. Petersburg University. In 1868, he started his service at the Russian ministry of foreign affairs. In 1871, he became a lecturer in international law in the university of St. Petersburg, and in 1872 professor of public law in the Imperial School of Law and the Imperial Alexander Lyceum. In 1874, he was selected special legal assistant to Prince Gorchakov, then imperial chancellor. His book on The Right of Private Property in War had appeared in 1869, and had been followed in 1873 by that upon The Office of Consul and Consular Jurisdiction in the East, which had been translated into German and republished at Berlin. These were the first of a long series of studies which won for their author a worldwide reputation, and raised the character of the Russian school of international jurisprudence in all civilised countries. First amongst them must be placed the great Recueil des trait√©s et conventions conclus par la Russie avec les puissances etrangeres (13 volumes, 1874‚Äì1902). This collection, published in Russian and French in parallel columns, contains not only the texts of the treaties but valuable introductions dealing with the diplomatic conditions of which the treaties were the outcome. These introductions are based largely on unpublished documents from the Russian archives. Of Martens' original works his International Law of Civilised Nations is perhaps the best known. It was written in Russian, a German edition appearing in 1884‚Äì1885, and a French edition in 1883-1887.; ; It displays much judgment and acumen, though some of the doctrines which it defends by no means command universal assent. More openly biased in character are such treatises as: *Russia and England in Central Asia (1879) *Russia's Conflict with China (1881) *The Egyptian Question (1882) *The African Conference of Berlin and the Colonial Policy of Modern States (1887) In the delicate questions raised in some of these works Martens stated his case with learning and ability, even when it was obvious that he was arguing as a special pleader. Martens was repeatedly chosen to act in international arbitrations. Among the controversies which he sat as judge or arbitrator were: the Pious Fund Affair, between Mexico and the United States ‚Äì the first case determined by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ‚Äì and the dispute between Great Britain and France over Newfoundland in 1891. He was the presiding arbitrator in the arbitration of the boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana which followed the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. He played an important part in the negotiations between his own country and Japan, which led to the peace of Portsmouth (August 1905) and prepared the way for the Russo-Japanese convention. He was employed in laying the foundations for the Hague Peace Conferences. He was one of the Russian plenipotentiaries at the first conference and president of the fourth committee ‚Äì that on maritime law ‚Äì at the second conference. His visits to the chief capitals of Europe in the early part of 1907 were an important preliminary in the preparation of the programme. He was judge of the Russian supreme prize court established to determine cases arising during the war with Japan. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford (D.C.L. October 1902 in connection with the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library), Cambridge, Edinburgh and Yale (LL.D. October 1901); he was also one of the runner-up nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1902. In April 1907, he addressed a remarkable letter to The Times on the position of the second Duma, in which he argued that the best remedy for the ills of Russia would be the dissolution of that assembly and the election of another on a narrower franchise. He died suddenly in June 1909. Ennoblement Friedrich Martens (circa 1900) on a 2014 Russian stamp The date and circumstances of his ennoblement are not clear. While it is undisputed that he called himself and was referred to as von or de Martens in publications since the early 1870s, this title might have been bestowed upon him either with one of the more distinguished Russian Orders, or with the title of a Privy Councillor (according to the Table of Ranks), or simply with his appointment as a full professor. He was never registered in the matriculae of the knightage of Livonia (Livl√§ndische Ritterschaft) or one of the other three Baltic knighthoods (that is of Estonia, Courland and √ñsel/Saaremaa). His surname, Martens, is included in the Russian Heraldic Book No. 14, though it is uncertain if this entry relates to him or to another noble of the same name. His social advancement was the more remarkable, as it was exclusively based on his professional merits. Popular culture * Friedrich Martens is featured as the main character in the novel Professor Martens' Departure (Professor Martensi √§ras√µit, 1984) by Estonian author Jaan Kross.  Criticism  In 1952, the German √©migr√© scholar in the US, Arthur Nussbaum, himself the author of a well-received history of the law of nations, published an article on Martens, which still makes waves. Nussbaum set himself the task of analysing the 'writings and actions' of Martens. First, he turned his attention to Martens' celebrated two-volume textbook and pointed out several pro-Russian gaps and biases in its historical part: \\"Flagrant lack of objectivity and conscientiousness. The Tsars and Tsarinas invariably appear as pure representatives of peace, conciliation, moderation and justice, whereas the moral qualities of their non-Russian opponents leave much to be desired.\\" Nussbaum pointed out that Martens gave an extensive meaning to the notion of \\"international administrative law,\\" even including war in the field of international administration, and emphasized that the supreme principle of international administrative law was expediency. Nussbaum was very critical of the application of that concept: \\"Expanding the range of international administrative law meant, therefore, expanding the dominance of expediency ‚Äì which is the very opposite of law.\\" Further, Nussbaum turned his attention to the other (publicist) writings of Martens, mostly the ones published in Revue de droit international et de l√©gislation compar√©e. Nussbaum noted that they were invariably signed by de Martens as professor of international law at the University of St. Petersburg and as member of the Institut de Droit International. Martens did not mention his high position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The articles were thus only unrestrained briefs for various actions of the Russian government. For example, Nussbaum concluded that the 1874 article by Martens on the Brussels conference, \\"It is purely apologetic and has nothing to do with law.\\" Then, Nussbaum turned to Martens's activities as arbitrator and found them \\"most conspicuous.\\" In particular, Nussbaum referred to a memorandum of Venezuelan lawyer Severo Mellet Provost that had been made public posthumously. The memorandum made the claim that Martens had approached his fellow US arbitrators-judges with an ultimatum: either they agreed with a generally pro-British solution or Martens, as umpire, would join the British arbitrators in a solution that would be even more against Venezuela. Nussbaum held that Mr Provost's account seemed \\"entirely credible in all essential parts\\" and concluded: \\"The spirit of arbitration will be perverted more seriously if the neutral arbitrator does not possess the external and internal independence from his government, which, according to the conception of most countries of Western civilization, is an essential attrribute of judicial office. That independence de Martens certainly did not have, and it is difficult to see how he could have acquired it within the framework of the Tsarist regime and tradition.\\" Finally, Nussbaum concluded: \\"It appears that de Martens did not think of international law as something different from, and in a sense above, diplomacy.‚Ä¶ de Martens considered in his professional duty as a scholar and writer on international law to defend and back up the policies of his government at any price.‚Ä¶ Obviously his motivation was overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, political and patriotic. Legal argument served him as a refined art to tender his pleas for Russian claims more impressive or more palatable. He was not really a man of law....\\" See also *List of Russian legal historians *Russian legal history Footnotes =Biographies= * Vladimir Pustogarov. (English version 2000) \\"Our Martens: F.F.

Narrowboat emerging from the south portal of the Blisworth Tunnel just north of Stoke Bruerne Boat-weighing machine at Stoke Bruerne, originally from the Glamorganshire Canal The civil parish population at the 2011 Census was 373. History Stoke Bruerne is mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086 as \\"Stoche\\" meaning \\"an outlying farmstead or hamlet\\". The form \\"Stokbruer\\" is used in 1254 being a suffix by the \\"Briwere\\" family of the Manor House. The village is fairly typical for this area of south Northamptonshire containing many traditional stone and thatched cottages. The village's main claim to fame is its situation on the Grand Union Canal making it a favourite destination for tourists. The population is split 196 male and 199 female in 169 households (2001 census). The parish is part of Tove Ward, named after the River Tove, of the district council of South Northamptonshire. The nearby country estate of Stoke Park along Shutlanger Road is occasionally open to the public in August, but all that remains of the main house are the two east and west wings known as Stoke Park Pavilions. In December 2008, the conservation project won the East Midlands' Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) Award, alongside Foxton Locks, another major canal restoration project in Leicestershire, near Market Harborough. Culture and tourism =Walks= Many public footpaths cross the area around Stoke Bruerne. One such walk, taking in Grafton Regis, was the subject of a Daily Telegraph article. Other walks in and around Northampton are mentioned in the County Council Right of way site. =Canal Museum= The village is home to one of the three museums owned and run by Canal & River Trust. The others are at Ellesmere Port and Gloucester Docks. =Blisworth tunnel= About half a mile north of the village is the south portal of Blisworth tunnel - accessible by a walk along the old towpath (on the eastern side of the canal - north of the village, the western side is either private property or inaccessible.) The tunnel is long and is the longest wide, freely navigable tunnel in Europe. The tunnel was awarded a Transport Trust 'Red Wheel' in recognition of its industrial heritage and importance on 22-August-2014 (30th anniversary of the reopening of the tunnel in 1984). The Red Wheel is on the blacksmith's forge in Stoke Bruerne. =Facilities= There are two canalside public houses, The Boat Inn, and The Navigation, both serving a variety of meals and drinks. There is a restaurant/takeaway, The Spice of Bruerne, various bed and breakfast facilities and tearooms. The village attracts many visitors all year round and especially during the summer months. There are parking restrictions at all times, except for residents, on village roads which are all marked with double yellow lines. There is, however, a pay and display car park close to the Museum (charge ¬£3 or 50p after 6pm). The parking restrictions are strictly enforced. A variety of boat trips may be booked from the canalside. Most of the time there is plenty of activity on the canal with boats going through the locks regularly and plenty going in and out of the tunnel. = Cricket Club = The village has a thriving cricket club with two sides competing in the Northamptonshire Cricket League, a Sunday side and booming junior section. In 2014 Stoke Bruerne CC merged with a Northampton-based Spencer CC to form 'Spencer Bruerne Cricket Club' who are based on Rookery Lane. Its ground is named after the late George Edward Tarry who donated the field to the village in the late 20th century. The pavilion is dedicated to his wife Elizabeth Fay Tarry, who died in the late 1960s. Conservation area consultation  In November 2007 the area of the village and surroundings, including Stoke Park, were the subject of an extensive conservation consultation by South Northants Council. Extensive additional documentation, including maps, pictures and historical documentation, is available from the South Northants Council's Planning website. Railway Stoke Bruerne had its own railway station, part of the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway (SMJR) and misnamed Stoke Bruern. This ran close to the village over Blisworth tunnel near the south portal. The station building has been converted to a private house and is along the road to Blisworth just outside the village. The line of the railway, and station platform, are still visible and the Blisworth road has a railway bridge still in position near the former station. The railway ran east to join the West Coast Main Line and then into Bedfordshire. Film The village appears, with Blisworth, in the Ealing Studios film Painted Boats (1945), filmed at the end of World War II and directed by Charles Crichton whose notable successes include The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and A Fish Called Wanda (1988).

In some contexts, it refers to a means of communication said to be understood by all living things. It may be the idea of an international auxiliary language for communication between groups speaking different primary languages. In other conceptions, it may be the primary language of all speakers, or the only existing language. Some religious and mythological traditions state that there was once a single universal language among all people, or shared by humans and supernatural beings. In other traditions, there is less interest in or a general deflection of the question. For example, in Islam the Arabic language is the language of the Qur'an, and therefore universal for Muslims. The written Classical Chinese language is still read widely but pronounced differently by readers in China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan; for centuries it was a de facto universal literary language for a broad-based culture. In something of the same way Sanskrit in India and Nepal, Tamil in India and Sri Lanka and Pali in Sri Lanka and in Theravada countries of South-East Asia (Burma, Thailand, Cambodia), were literary languages for many for whom they were not their mother tongue. Comparably, the Latin language (qua Medieval Latin) was in effect a universal language of literati in the Middle Ages, and the language of the Vulgate Bible in the area of Catholicism, which covered most of Western Europe and parts of Northern and Central Europe also. In a more practical fashion, trade languages, such as ancient Koine Greek, may be seen as a kind of real universal language, that was used for commerce. In historical linguistics, monogenesis refers to the idea that all spoken human languages are descended from a single ancestral language spoken many thousands of years ago. Mythological and religious universal languages Various religious texts, myths, and legends describe a state of humanity in which originally only one language was spoken. In Jewish and Christian beliefs, the story of the Tower of Babel tells of a consequent \\"confusion of tongues\\" (the splintering of numerous languages from an original Adamic language) as a punishment from God. Myths exist in other cultures describing the creation of multiple languages as an act of a god as well, such as the destruction of a 'knowledge tree' by Brahma in Indic tradition, or as a gift from the God Hermes in Greek myth. Other myths describe the creation of different languages as concurrent with the creation of different tribes of people, or due to supernatural events.  Early modern history  Recognizable strands in the contemporary ideas on universal languages took form only in Early Modern Europe. In the early 17th century some believed that a universal language would facilitate greater unity among mankind largely due to the subsequent spread of religion, specifically Christianity, as espoused in the works of Comenius. But there were ideas of a universal language apart from religion as well. A lingua franca or trade language was nothing very new; but an international auxiliary language was a natural wish in light of the gradual decline of Latin. Literature in vernacular languages became more prominent with the Renaissance. Over the course of the 18th century, learned works largely ceased to be written in Latin. According to Colton Booth (Origin and Authority in Seventeenth-Century England (1994) p. 174) \\"The Renaissance had no single view of Adamic language and its relation to human understanding.\\" The question was more exactly posed in the work of Francis Bacon. In the vast writings of Gottfried Leibniz can be found many elements relating to a possible universal language, specifically a constructed language, a concept that gradually came to replace that of a rationalized Latin as the natural basis for a projected universal language. Leibniz conceived of a characteristica universalis (also see mathesis universalis), an \\"algebra\\" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. This algebra would include rules for symbolic manipulation, what he called a calculus ratiocinator . His goal was to put reasoning on a firmer basis by reducing much of it to a matter of calculation that many could grasp. The characteristica would build on an alphabet of human thought. Leibniz's work is bracketed by some earlier mathematical ideas of Ren√© Descartes, and the satirical attack of Voltaire on Panglossianism. Descartes's ambitions were far more modest than Leibniz's, and also far more successful, as shown by his wedding of algebra and geometry to yield what we now know as analytic geometry. Decades of research on symbolic artificial intelligence have not brought Leibniz's dream of a characteristica any closer to fruition. Other 17th-century proposals for a 'philosophical' (i.e. universal) language include those by Francis Lodwick, Thomas Urquhart (possibly parodic), George Dalgarno (Ars signorum, 1661), and John Wilkins (An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language, 1668). The classification scheme in Roget's Thesaurus ultimately derives from Wilkins's Essay. Candide, a satire written by Voltaire, took aim at Leibniz as Dr. Pangloss, with the choice of name clearly putting universal language in his sights, but satirizing mainly the optimism of the projector as much as the project. The argument takes the universal language itself no more seriously than the ideas of the speculative scientists and virtuosi of Jonathan Swift's Laputa. For the like-minded of Voltaire's generation, universal language was tarred as fool's gold with the same brush as philology with little intellectual rigour, and universal mythography, as futile and arid directions. In the 18th century, some rationalist natural philosophers sought to recover a supposed Edenic language. It was assumed that education inevitably took people away from an innate state of goodness they possessed, and therefore there was an attempt to see what language a human child brought up in utter silence would speak. This was assumed to be the Edenic tongue, or at least the lapsarian tongue. Others attempted to find a common linguistic ancestor to all tongues; there were, therefore, multiple attempts to relate esoteric languages to Hebrew (e.g. Basque and Irish), as well as the beginnings of comparative linguistics. Modern history At the end of the 19th century, there was a large profusion of constructed languages intended as genuine, spoken language. There were created languages which do not belong to any country and can be learned by everyone. Among these are Esperanto, Ido, and Interlingua. At that time, those ideas were readily accepted. With the advent of World Wars and the Cold War, these successes were buried. The constructed language movement produced such languages as Latino sine flexione (1903), Ido (1907), Interlingue (1922), and Interlingua (1951).Gode, Alexander, Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language, New York: Storm Publishers, 1951. English remains the dominant language of international business and global communication through the influence of global media and the former British Empire that had established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. However, English is not the only language used in major international organizations, because many countries do not recognize English as a universal language. For instance, the United Nations use six languages ‚Äî Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. The early ideas of a universal language with complete conceptual classification by categories is still debated on various levels. Michel Foucault believed such classifications to be subjective, citing Borges' fictional Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge's Taxonomy as an illustrative example.

More recently it has been used by historians of science and visual culture. Although sometimes wrongly conflated with ethnographic film, Visual Anthropology encompasses much more, including the anthropological study of all visual representations such as dance and other kinds of performance, museums and archiving, all visual arts, and the production and reception of mass media. Histories and analyses of representations from many cultures are part of Visual Anthropology: research topics include sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs, cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphics, paintings and photographs. Also within the province of the subfield are studies of human vision, properties of media, the relationship of visual form and function, and applied, collaborative uses of visual representations. Multimodal anthropology describes the latest turn in the subfield, which considers how emerging technologies like immersive virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile apps, social networking, gaming along with film, photography and art is reshaping anthropological research, practice and teaching. History Even before the emergence of anthropology as an academic discipline in the 1880s, ethnologists used photography as a tool of research.Jay Ruby. \\"Visual Anthropology.\\" In Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology, David Levinson and Melvin Ember, editors. New York: Henry Holt and Company, vol. 4:1345‚Äì1351, 1996 . Anthropologists and non-anthropologists conducted much of this work in the spirit of salvage ethnography or attempts to record for posterity the ways-of-life of societies assumed doomed to extinction (see, for instance, the Native American photography of Edward Curtis)Harald E.L. Prins, \\"Visual Anthropology.\\" Pp. 506‚Äì525, In T.Biolsi. ed. A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing]. The history of anthropological filmmaking is intertwined with that of non-fiction and documentary filmmaking, although ethnofiction may be considered as a genuine subgenre of ethnographic film. Some of the first motion pictures of the ethnographic other were made with Lumi√®re equipment (Promenades des √âl√©phants √† Phnom Penh, 1901).Erik Barnouw. Documentary: A history of the Non-Fiction Film. New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993. Robert Flaherty, probably best known for his films chronicling the lives of Arctic peoples (Nanook of the North, 1922), became a filmmaker in 1913 when his supervisor suggested that he take a camera and equipment with him on an expedition north. Flaherty focused on \\"traditional\\" Inuit ways of life, omitting with few exceptions signs of modernity among his film subjects (even to the point of refusing to use a rifle to help kill a walrus his informants had harpooned as he filmed them, according to Barnouw; this scene made it into Nanook where it served as evidence of their \\"pristine\\" culture). This pattern would persist in many ethnographic films to follow (see as an example Robert Gardner's Dead Birds). By the 1940s and early 1950s, anthropologists such as Hortense Powdermaker,Hortense Powdermaker. Hollywood, the Dream Factory: An Anthropologist Studies the Movie Makers. Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1950. Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead (Trance and Dance in Bali, 1952) and Mead and Rhoda Metraux, eds., (The Study of Culture at a Distance, 1953) were bringing anthropological perspectives to bear on mass media and visual representation. Karl G. Heider notes in his revised edition of Ethnographic Film (2006) that after Bateson and Mead, the history of visual anthropology is defined by \\"the seminal works of four men who were active for most of the second half of the twentieth century: Jean Rouch, John Marshall, Robert Gardner, and Tim Asch. By focusing on these four, we can see the shape of ethnographic film\\" (p. 15). Many, including Peter Loizos,Loizos, Peter 1993. Innovation in Ethnographic Film: From Innocence to Self-Consciousness, 1955-1985. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. would add the name of filmmaker/author David MacDougall to this select group. In 1966, filmmaker Sol Worth and anthropologist John Adair taught a group of Navajo Indians in Arizona how to capture 16mm film. The hypothesis was that artistic choices made by the Navajo would reflect the 'perceptual structure' of the Navajo world.Darnell R. Through Navajo eyes: An exploration in film communication and anthropology. American Anthropologist, Vol 76, pp 890, Oct. 1974 The goals of this experiment were primarily ethnographic and theoretical. Decades later, however, the work has inspired a variety of participatory and applied anthropological initiatives - ranging from photovoice to virtual museum collections - in which cameras are given to local collaborators as a strategy for empowerment.Turner, Terence 1992.

Timeline and breadth of prehistoric visual representation While art historians are clearly interested in some of the same objects and processes, visual anthropology places these artifacts within a holistic cultural context. Archaeologists, in particular, use phases of visual development to try to understand the spread of humans and their cultures across contiguous landscapes as well as over larger areas. By 10,000 BP, a system of well-developed pictographs was in use by boating peoplesJim Bailey, Sailing to Paradise and was likely instrumental in the development of navigation and writing, as well as a medium of storytelling and artistic representation. Early visual representations often show the female form, with clothing appearing on the female body around 28,000 BP, which archaeologists know now corresponds with the invention of weaving in Old Europe. This is an example of the holistic nature of visual anthropology: a figurine depicting a woman wearing diaphanous clothing is not merely an object of art, but a window into the customs of dress at the time, household organization (where they are found), transfer of materials (where the clay came from) and processes (when did firing clay become common), when did weaving begin, what kind of weaving is depicted and what other evidence is there for weaving, and what kinds of cultural changes were occurring in other parts of human life at the time. Visual anthropology, by focusing on its own efforts to make and understand film, is able to establish many principles and build theories about human visual representation in general.

It was manufactured by the French government-owned Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne (MAS) company. The AA-52 is still used today as a vehicle-mounted weapon due to large quantities in service, but has been replaced in the helicopter role by the Belgian FN MAG, starting with the EC 725 Caracal of the special operations units and the Air Force search and rescue teams. The AA-52 had been largely phased out for infantry use in favour of the lighter FN Minimi but remains in use. History The AA-52 general-purpose machine gun was conceived and developed following the French military's experiences in the First Indochina War during the early 1950s. At that time, the French army was equipped with an assortment of weapons from British and American sources, as well as some German weapons from the Second World War. Effective supply of ammunition and replacement parts was an almost insoluble task and the army decided to adopt a standard machine gun. The result was the AA-52, conceived for ease of production. The construction is of simple welded stamped sheet steel. The AA-52 was partially withdrawn from the service of the French army in 2008. It was replaced in the 2010s by 10,881 FN MAG general-purpose machine guns. Design The AA-52 is a peculiar weapon among modern machine guns because it uses lever-delayed blowback operation, also seen in the FAMAS rifle, manufactured at the same factory. When firing, the pressure pushing the case head rearward initiates an impulse on a cam that sends the bolt carrier rearward. After a certain distance, a link (in this case the firing pin) pulls the bolt head, hence extracting the spent case. Since there is no primary extraction, the chamber is fluted to allow powder gases to flow back, unsticking the case from the wall chamber as with Heckler & Koch‚Äìtype roller-delayed blowback weapons. The feed and trigger mechanisms are derived from the MG 42. The AA-52 can be used as a light machine gun with a bipod or as a heavy machine gun with a tripod. When used with a tripod for continuous fire, the gun is fitted with a heavier barrel. In the light machine gun configuration, the AA-52 is a relatively light weapon to carry. The AA-52 can be fired from the shoulder but this is slightly awkward because of the position of the handle, however the bipod can be used as a handguard when not in use. The barrel is changed by pressing a latch and rotating it a quarter of a turn. The APX(SOM) telescopic sight used on the MAS-49 and the FR-F1 sniper rifle can be mounted on the AA-52 as well as an infrared night sight.

Variants =NF-1= The AA-52 originally used the standard 7.5√ó54mm French cartridge. The general adoption of the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge reduced the opportunity for export sales, and the gun was adapted for this standard NATO calibre. =MAC-58= The MAC-58 was a version of the AA-52 chambered in .50 BMG. A few prototypes were tested and one retained for preserial production, but it never reached production due to the large quantity of US M2 Browning machine guns already in service with the French armed forces.

Rising to , it is irregularly shaped and extends in a north‚Äìsouth direction. It was charted in October 1903 by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenski√∂ld, who named it for Sir James Clark Ross, the leader of a British expedition to this area in 1842 that discovered and roughly charted a number of points along the eastern side of the island. The style, \\"James\\" Ross Island is used to avoid confusion with the more widely known Ross Island in McMurdo Sound. It is one of several islands around the peninsula known as Graham Land, which is closer to South America than any other part of that continent.ESA Science & Technology: Graham Land The island was connected to the Antarctic mainland by an ice shelf until 1995, when the ice shelf collapsed, making the Prince Gustav Channel passable for the first time.Rubin, Jeff (2008). Antarctica, p. 276. Lonely Planet. Mendel Polar Station, the first Czech Antarctic Base, is located on the island.  Paleontology  Two dinosaur-bearing formations are present on the island, both from the Upper Cretaceous: the Santa Marta Formation and the Snow Hill Island Formation. These are two of only three known formations to have dinosaur fossils in Antarctica. The first dinosaur discovered in Antarctica was Antarctopelta oliveroi, a medium-sized ankylosaur found on James Ross Island by Argentinian geologists Eduardo Olivero and Roberto Scasso in 1986. The dinosaur was recovered from the Campanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous Santa Marta Formation, about south of Santa Marta Cove on the north part of the island. The ankylosaur was not formally named until 2006. James Ross Island from NASA's DC-8 aircraft during an AirSAR 2004 mission over the Antarctic Peninsula In December 2003, U.S. paleontologist Judd Case from Saint Mary's College of California and U.S. geologist James Martin from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology discovered the bones of a theropod dinosaur on the island. Nicknamed \\"Naze\\" after the northerly Naze Peninsula on which it was found, the Late Cretaceous remains include an upper jaw and teeth, and most of the lower legs and feet. Little information is available, but the shape of the leg and feet indicate it was a runner. In 2019, it was given the name Imperobator antarcticus. It was large, about the size of Utahraptor. It is the second Antarctic theropod discovered, after Cryolophosaurus. An ornithopod was found in the Snow Hill Island Formation by Argentine paleontologists Rodolfo An√≠bal Coria and Juan Jos√© Moly in 2008. In 2013, Coria named it Trinisaura santamartaensis.

N√∫√±ez, 2002, \\"Paleobiogeograf√≠a de los dinosaurios cret√°cicos polares de Gondwana\\", Ameghiniana (Res√∫menes) 39(4): 15R was named Morrosaurus antarcticus by Sebastian Rozadilla, Federico Lisandro Agnolin, Fernando Emilio Novas, Alexis Rolando Aranciaga Mauro, Matthew J. Motta, Juan Manuel Lirio Marcelo and Pablo Isasi. The genus name refers to the site of El Morro on James Ross Island, where the remains of the species were found. The specific name refers to Antarctica. Named features James Ross Island features several features named by various surveying and exploration groups. * Brandy Bay (), a bay wide on the northwest coast of James Ross Island, entered west of Bibby Point. It was probably first seen by Otto Nordenski√∂ld in 1903, and was surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1945. During a subsequent visit to this bay by a FIDS party in 1952, there was a discussion as to whether medicinal brandy should be used as treatment for a dog bite. The name arose naturally from this incident. * Davies Dome (), a small ice dome southeast of Stoneley Point. * Rohss Bay (), a bay 11 nautical miles (20 km) wide, between Capes Broms and Obelisk on the southwest side of James Ross Island. It was discovered by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition, 1901‚Äì04, under Nordenskjold, and named by him for August and Wilhelm Rohss, patrons of the expedition. * Sharp Valley (), a small valley located 1 mile (1.6 km) east-southeast of Stoneley Point on James Ross Island. It was named in 1983 by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) after Michael C. Sharp, British Antarctic Survey (BAS) field assistant in the area, 1981-82. * Stoneley Point (), a rocky point on the northwest coast of James Ross Island, 4 nautical miles (7 km) west of Brandy Bay. It was named after Robert Stoneley, a FIDS geologist at Hope Bay, by the UK-APC in 1952.

It created mandatory, public disclosure of financial and employment history of public officials and their immediate families. It also created restrictions on lobbying efforts by public officials for a set period after leaving public office. Last, it created the U.S. Office of Independent Counsel, tasked with investigating government officials. Title I Title I requires those in the public service sector to fill out financial disclosure forms which include the sources and amounts of income, gifts, reimbursements, the identity and approximate value of property held and liabilities owed, transactions in property, commodities, and securities, and certain financial interests of a spouse or dependent. The report must then be filed to the appropriate state officer of his or her state, and the committee charged with issues of ethics in his or her respective house of Congress. The President, Vice President, counsel appointed to the United States Department of Justice, and nominees to positions that require United States Senate confirmation must file with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. People that must file reports include, but are not limited to: the President, Vice President, employees and officers of the Executive Branch, Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General, each Governor of the Board of Governors of the U.S. Postal Service and each officer or employee of the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission. Disclosure must also be made available to the public shortly after they are submitted. The Attorney General of the United States can bring charges against anyone who falsifies information in the reports. Title II Vote to repeal took place in 1989, and took effect January 1, 1991. This title originally governed financial disclosure by executive branch officials, but disclosure rules for all three branches were later consolidated into the first title. Title III Vote to repeal took place in 1989, and took effect January 1, 1991. This title originally governed financial disclosure by judicial branch officials, but disclosure rules for all three branches were later consolidated into the first title. Title IV Title IV created the Office of Government Ethics. The Office of Government Ethics' director is appointed by the President, and approved by the Senate. He or she is charged with providing direction on Executive Branch policies of disclosure, and collaborates with the Attorney General in investigations of ethics violations. Title V Title V restricts outside employment on people making above $120,000 a year with adjustment for location as of 2011. He or she cannot be employed by an \\"entity which provides professional services involving a fiduciary relationship\\", have his or her name used by that entity, work on the board of that entity, or teach without prior authorization by the appropriate government ethics department or figure. It increased length of prohibition of lobbying work in front of the agency that he or she was employed by from one to two years. Finally, it allows for judges to teach when not on active duty. Title VI Title VI amended Title 28 of the United States Code. Title VI of The Act expired on June 30, 1999. It has been permanently replaced with Title 28 (CFR), Chapter VI, Part 600. It requires the Attorney General to investigate specific allegations of federal offenses by the President, Vice President, individuals at specified salary levels in the Executive Office of the President and the Department of Justice, any Assistant Attorney General, the Director and Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, all such specified individuals who held office during the incumbency of the President or during the period the previous President held office, if such preceding President was of the same political party as the incumbent President, and any officer of the principal national campaign committee seeking the election or reelection of the President. The Attorney General must decide if there is merit to the allegation within 90 days. If so, he or she must have a special prosecutor appointed who has all the power of the Department of Justice office except those specific to the Attorney General. The special prosecutor is chosen through a system wherein the Chief Justice of the United States appoints a panel of three judges from the Circuit Court of Appeals, one of which must be from the District of Columbia, who serve three-year terms and choose the special prosecutor. The special prosecutor has the authority to send any information to the United States Congress that he or she deems relevant and can provide counsel in issues that may call for impeachment of the person under investigation. The special prosecutor can only be removed by impeachment and conviction by congress, or by the Attorney General for \\"substantial improprieties\\" or a physical or mental condition that affects performance. The Department of Justice is required to suspend all investigations within the realm of the special prosecutor. The Attorney General has the authority to declare anyone disqualified from participating in an investigation because of conflict of interest. Criticism Justice Antonin Scalia provided critiques of the Act, based on both Constitutional law and the potential for harm in practice, in his dissenting opinion in the case Morrison v. Olson. Justice Scalia, a judicial conservative, noted that the U.S. Constitution granted consolidated power to enforce the law exclusively to the Executive Branch. The Act extended the power to initiate criminal investigation to the United States House of Representatives and the Senate, which Scalia viewed as a violation of the separation of powers. He believed that the House of Representatives' investigation through the use of a special prosecutor \\"[arose] out of a bitter power dispute between the President and the Legislative Branch\\". Even some Congressmen who had voted for the Act criticized it privately, leading to speculation that \\"if it had been an anonymous vote, it would have been voted down two-to-one\\". The bill's most controversial feature among Congressmen was its limit on outside income, which could be no more than 15 percent of his public service income. This restriction applied only to \\"earned\\" income, while excluding investment income from stocks or bonds. About a half-dozen members of the House of Representatives reportedly would not speak to the Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, because he pushed the Act through. Their claim was that the Act favored people with \\"unearned\\" wealth, people who already had it, over people with \\"earned\\" additional income, usually with a law practice on the side. Democratic Representative David R. Bowen of Mississippi called the ethics climate of the time a \\"witch-hunt\\". Specific provisions of the Act have faced criticism as either too weak or too strong. The Special Prosecutor created by Title VI was empowered to pursue investigations with minimal evidence, and was required to pursue any accusation that the District Attorney could not disprove. It allowed for legal harassment of political opponents, even in cases that prosecutors stated they would have dropped in any other federal court. Republicans complained of abuse by Democrats during the Supreme Court case of Morrison v. Olson, and Democrats later complained that Kenneth Starr's three and a half year investigation of President Bill Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal was motivated by partisanship. The Office of Government Ethics created by Title IV has been criticized on the grounds that its limited budget, leadership and prestige are inadequate for the Office to function effectively. Other critics complain that public disclosure involves a violation of privacy which may deter good people from public service.

Early career Born in BuzƒÉu, he entered the Saint Sava National College in Bucharest, and then studied Law in Paris. Marghiloman was elected to the Romanian Parliament in 1884, and joined the government in 1888. A member of the Conservative Party, he supported cooperation with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary in the Triple Alliance, and, at the beginning of World War I, he favoured neutrality. Romania remained neutral until 1916, when she entered on the Allied side and this was the reason he refused a seat in the Ion BrƒÉtianu's liberal government. After the Germans occupied Bucharest, he remained there as the president of the Romanian Red Cross, and acted as a mediator between the German occupation authorities and the Romanian population. He rejected the ideas of the German side of forming a parallel administration to King Ferdinand I's government that was moved to Ia≈üi. Cabinet and later years Alexandru Marghiloman signing the Treaty of Bucharest on May 7, 1918 However, since Bolshevist Russia withdrew from the war and the Germans could occupy the rest of Romania, King Ferdinand requested Marghiloman to become a Prime Minister, hoping that with a pro-German Prime Minister it would be easier to make peace with the Germans, and knowing that Germany would consider the Western Front to be much more important. Indeed, Marghiloman negotiated and signed a peace treaty (known as the Treaty of Bucharest) with the Central Powers on May 7, 1918, which proved to be very punitive and restrictive for Romania. However, this treaty was never ratified. Marghiloman's cabinet fell after the Compi√®gne armistice, and it was replaced quickly with the pro-Allied General Constantin CoandƒÉ on November 6, under whose cabinet Romania re-entered the war against Germany on November 10, a day before the end of the war. Retired from public life following the collapse of Conservative politicians in post-war Greater Romania, Marghiloman died in his native town. Trivia In his private life, Marghiloman was also an enthusiastic horse breeder: horses owned by him won the Romanian Derby 28 times. His large estate, the Albatros Villa (named after one of his horses) in BuzƒÉu, was for a long time a meeting place for Conservative politicians. He also had a mansion in Hagie»ôti, which was built in 1869‚Äì1874. Marghiloman gave his name to Marghiloman coffee, Turkish coffee boiled in brandy.  Notes  References * George D.

Burslem was born 2 February 1836 in County Limerick, Ireland, the son of George James Burslem of the 94th Regiment of Foot and Susan (n√©e Vokes), of Limerick (married Dublin 15 March 1836). His father was English, and traced his family back to the town of Burslem in Staffordshire. His grandfather was Colonel Nathaniel Godolphin Burslem who was awarded the Gold Medal - the forerunner of the VC Medal. On 21 August 1860 at the Taku Forts, China, during the Second China War Lieutenant Burslem, then aged 24 and serving in the 67th Regiment of Foot, British Army, and Private Thomas Lane of his regiment displayed great gallantry for which they were both awarded the VC. They swam the ditches of the North Taku Fort and attempted, during the assault and before an entrance had been effected by anyone, to enlarge an opening in the wall, through which they eventually entered. In doing so, they were both severely wounded. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum & Memorial Garden, Winchester, England. He later achieved the rank of captain before selling his commission and sailing, along with his brother John Godolphin Burslem, to New Zealand. He arrived in 1865 and bought land in the North Island and was planning to grow flax, but he and an acquaintance capsized their canoe on the Thames River, both drowning on 14 July 1865. His body was not recovered.

Of necessity, it would not only provide sustenance for himself, his family, esquires and servants, but also the means to furnish himself and his retinue with horses and armour to fight for his overlord in battle. It was effectively the size of a fee (or \\"fief\\" which is synonymous with \\"fee\\") sufficient to support one knight in the ongoing performance of his feudal duties (knight-service). A knight's fee cannot be stated as a standard number of acres as the required acreage to produce a given crop or revenue would vary depending on many factors, including its location, the richness of its soil and the local climate, as well as the presence of other exploitable resources such as fish-weirs, quarries of rock or mines of minerals. If a knight's fee is deemed co- terminous with a manor, an average size would be between 1,000 and 5,000 acres, of which much in early times was still \\"waste\\", forest and uncultivated moorland. Creation A knight's fee could be created by the king himself or by one of his tenants-in-chief by separating off an area of land from his own demesne (land held in-hand), which process when performed by the latter was known as subinfeudation, and establishing therein a new manor for the use of a knight who would by the process of enfeoffment become his tenant by paying homage and fealty to his new overlord. This homage and fealty was a vow of loyalty to his overlord, with corresponding vow of protection received, and an undertaking to provide a specified form of service commonly due under feudal land tenure in England. Broadly speaking such service was either military (knight-service) or non-military (serjeanty, etc.). Military service was generally to a maximum of 40 days per annum, signifying that he would have to fight for his overlord in battle. No cash rent was payable, although military service was later transformable into scutage. A knight was required to maintain the dignity of knighthood, which meant that he should live in suitable style and be well-turned out in battle, with the required number of esquires to serve him and with horses, arms and armour for all. Used as a unit for tax assessment A feudal tenant-in-chief of the king was assessed for certain feudal aids according as to how many knight's fees he held, whether tenanted or held in demesne. Where a knight's fee was inherited by joint heiresses, the fee would be split into two or more moieties, that is two separate parts, each a manor of itself with its own manorial court, each deemed half a knight's fee, and so-on down to smaller fractions. Thus a magnate could be overlord to, say, 12 knight's fees. Subinfeudation A knight's fee was not only originally created by the process of subinfeudation, but could itself be split into smaller units by the same process, otherwise than through inheritance. By this means, until the practice was outlawed in 1290 by the statute of Quia Emptores, a knight could create his own feudal retainer who would pledge fealty to him rather than to the overlord. Such a holding was termed a sub-fee. It can thus be seen that the knight's fee was the base unit of land valuation for use in the feudal system.

While launching in 2003 a domain automatic registration system by means of EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol), NASK introduced the Partner Programme within the scope of registration and service of domain names. The NASK Partner Programme is a solution operating in accordance with the world recognised ‚ÄúRegistry-Registrar‚Äù model. NASK (Registry) provides its Partners (Registrars) with the functionality of independent registering and servicing domain names in the .pl domain registry. Each entrepreneur, meeting the technical and formal requirements specified by NASK, may become a NASK‚Äôs Partner. The Partner Programme gives subscribers an opportunity to choose the most attractive offer from a number of Polish and foreign providers rendering domain name related services. Currently, over 99.9 percent of all domain name registrations are effected by NASK‚Äôs Partners. In 2003, NASK, as one of the first registries in the world, introduced the maintenance of domain names with diacritic signs (Internationalized Domain Names). Also in 2003, on the NASK‚Äôs initiative, the Court of Conciliation for Internet Domains organized at the Polish Chamber of Information Technology and Telecommunications was established. Besides domain registration, NASK offers through its Partners such services as Waiting List Service (WLS) ‚Äì the so-called ‚Äúoption‚Äù enabling the purchase of the 3-year period of priority for registration of a domain name in case it has been deleted, or Domain Name Tasting (DNT) ‚Äì a service consisting in registration of a domain name for the period of 14 days for the purpose of testing its attractiveness. Since the end of September 2009, NASK has been cooperating with the Partners on the basis of a prepaid model, where the fee for registration is collected automatically from the Partner‚Äôs account. In order to increase the .pl domain security, since 20 December 2011 NASK has begun to implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) in the production environment, and since 4 June 2012 subscribers have been allowed to forward to the .pl registry the DS records of secured domain names. Since 1 July 2013, in accordance with the agreement concluded with IPPT PAN (Institute of Fundamental Technological Research Polish Academy of Sciences), NASK has been providing the maintenance of .gov.pl domain names. NASK is the official representative of Poland in organizations such as FIRST, CENTR and ICANN, which in turn authorizes NASK to indirectly influence the operation of DNS.

He then held the positions of commander of the 8th Army Corps, commander of the Cavalry Corps, commander of the Military Command of the Capital during the Legionnaires' rebellion, and commander of the 4th Army Corps (1941‚Äì1943). As commander of the 8th Army Corps, it was General SƒÉnƒÉtescu who stopped the Pogrom from Dorohoi against the Jews launched in 1940. = Second World War = When Romania entered World War II on June 22, 1941, SƒÉnƒÉtescu was the commanding officer of the 4th Army Corps. He participated for two years in the battles on the Eastern Front, standing out in the Battle of Odessa and the Battle of Stalingrad. He was decorated on November 7, 1941 with the Order of the Star of Romania with swords in the rank of Grand Officer with the ribbon of \\"Military Virtue\\" \\"for the dexterity with which he led the troops of the Army Corps in the battle of Odessa. Acting with all his might, he definitively defeated the enemy resistance in the South TƒÉtarca region, entering Odessa.\\"Decretul Regal nr. 3.086 din 7 noiembrie 1941 pentru conferiri de decora»õiuni de rƒÉzboiu, publicat √Æn Monitorul Oficial, anul CIX, nr. 278 din 22 noiembrie 1941, partea I-a, p. 7.284. He was promoted to the rank of Army Corps General on January 24, 1942. In March 1943 he was called from the front and appointed head of the Royal Military House (March 20, 1943 ‚Äì January 24, 1944) and then marshal of the Palace (April 1, 1944 ‚Äì August 23, 1944). He participated in several meetings with civilians and soldiers close to the Royal House, who planned the overthrow of the Antonescu regime, Romania's exit from the anti-Soviet war and turning around the weapons against Nazi Germany. On August 23, 1944, King Michael I dismissed and arrested Marshal Ion Antonescu; SƒÉnƒÉtescu was one of the organizers of King Michael's Coup, being a close friend of the king. On the evening of the same day, SƒÉnƒÉtescu was appointed President of the Council of Ministers, forming a military cabinet in which the leaders of the four parties that had supported King Michael had one representative without a portfolio. The communist Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu also held the position of ad-interim minister of justice. The SƒÉnƒÉtescu government was entrusted with the important mission of consolidating the coup by repelling the attack of the German contingents in the country. In the battles between August 24 and August 31, a large part of Romania was liberated, although the Soviet Union de facto occupied the country. The appointment of SƒÉnƒÉtescu to head the government was made official by a royal decree issued only on September 1, 1944.Decretul regal nr. 1.627 din 1 septembrie 1944 pentru numirea Pre»ôedintelui Consiliului de Mini»ôtri The SƒÉnƒÉtescu government sent a delegation consisting of Prince Barbu A. »òtirbey, General Dumitru DƒÉmƒÉceanu, Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, and Ghi»õƒÉ Popp to negotiate and sign the Armistice Convention in Moscow with the United Nations. The Russians delayed receiving the delegation until their army fully occupied the Romanian territory, the deed being signed on September 12. On September 15, a working meeting took place between members of the SƒÉnƒÉtescu government and participants in the signing of the armistice, during which Iuliu Maniu observed that Romania's negotiators had to \\"accept points that represent a real capitulation, not a free Armistice contract.\\" Also, on September 12, 1944, at the energetic intervention of SƒÉnƒÉtescu, Anton Buga (who had been sentenced to death) was released,. On November 4, 1944, the Second SƒÉnƒÉtescu cabinet was formed, led by General SƒÉnƒÉtescu. The cabinet faced the challenges of the Romanian Communist Party (supported by the Soviet Union), which requested that it be granted two strategic ministries, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of War. Losing the trust of the leaders of the liberal and peasant parties, who perceived him as too moderate towards the communists, SƒÉnƒÉtescu submitted his resignation on December 2, 1944. SƒÉnƒÉtescu was promoted to the rank of general on December 6, 1944. He then served as Chief of the Romanian General Staff (December 11, 1944 ‚Äì June 20, 1945), developing the battle plans of the Romanian Army and leading the military operations until the final defeat of Germany. After the end of the war, General SƒÉnƒÉtescu served for a period as inspector general of the army.  Death  SƒÉnƒÉtescu died of cancer in 1947 in Bucharest, being buried at Bellu Cemetery. He was the last general of the Romanian Army buried with full honours according to his rank.  Medals  SƒÉnƒÉtescu was decorated with numerous Romanian and foreign decorations and medals, including: * 20px Order of the Crown, in the rank of Grand Officer with military insignia (May 9, 1941)Decretul regal nr. 1.300 din 9 mai 1941 pentru acordƒÉri de decora»õii, publicat √Æn Monitorul Oficial, anul CIX, nr. 109 din 10 mai 1941, partea I-a, p. 2.486. * 20px Order of the Star of Romania with swords in the rank of Grand Officer with ribbon of \\"Military Virtue\\" (November 7, 1941) * 20px Order of Michael the Brave with swords, cl.

American Literary Publishing in the Mid-nineteenth Century: The Business of Ticknor and Fields. Cambridge University Press, 2003: 20. =Publishing career= James Thomas Fields, photographed by Julia Margaret Cameron In 1839, he joined William Ticknor and became junior partner in the publishing and bookselling firm known after 1845 as Ticknor and Fields. Ticknor oversaw the business side of the firm while Fields was its literary expert. He became known for being likable, for his ability to find creative talent, and for his ability to promote authors and win their loyalty.McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 192. With this company, Fields became the publisher of leading contemporary American writers, with whom he was on terms of close personal friendship. He was also the American publisher of some of the best-known British writers of his time, some of whom he also knew intimately. The company paid royalties to these British authors, including Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray, at a time when other American publishers pirated the works of those authors.Corbett, William. Literary New England: A History and Guide. Boston: Faber and Faber, 1993: 77. The first collected edition of Thomas de Quincey's works (20 vols., 1850‚Äì1855) was published by his firm. Ticknor and Fields built their company to have a substantial influence in the literary scene which writer and editor Nathaniel Parker Willis acknowledged in a letter to Fields: \\"Your press is the announcing-room of the country's Court of Poetry.\\"Brooks, Van Wyck. The Flowering of New England. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, 1952: 495. Sometime in 1844, Fields was engaged to Mary Willard, a local woman six years younger than him.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 138. Grief-stricken, he left the United States for a time and traveled to Europe. In 1854, Fields married Annie Adams, who was an author herself. Mrs. Fields was instrumental in helping Mr. Fields establish literary salons at their home at 37 Charles Street in Boston, where they entertained many well-known writers.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2004: 353‚Äì353. One such writer was Nathaniel Hawthorne. After Hawthorne's death in 1864, Fields served as a pallbearer for his funeral alongside Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Edwin Percy Whipple.Baker, Carlos. Emerson Among the Eccentrics: A Group Portrait. New York: Viking Press, 1996: 448. .

Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 107‚Äì108. Ticknor died in 1864, leaving Fields the senior partner for the firm. Fields was less concerned with the retail store owned by the company and wanted to focus on publishing. On November 12, 1864, he sold the Old Corner BookstoreTryon, Warren S. Parnassus Corner: A Life of James T. Fields, Publisher to the Victorians. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 279. and moved Ticknor and Fields to 124 Tremont Street. In 1868 the business became Fields, Osgood, and Company, recognizing James R. Osgood. On New Year's Day, 1871, Fields announced his retirement at a small gathering of friends.Tryon, Warren S. Parnassus Corner: A Life of James T. Fields, Publisher to the Victorians. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 361. =Later life and death= Fields retired from his publishing company in 1871 to focus on lecturing and writing. No longer involved with editorial duties, he then devoted himself to lecturing and writing. He also edited, with Edwin Percy Whipple, A Family Library of British Poetry (1878). Fields became increasingly popular as a lecturer throughout the 1870s.Blanchard, Paula. Sarah Orne Jewett: Her World and Her Work. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1994: 133. In May 1879, Fields suffered a brain hemorrhage and collapsed before a scheduled lecture at Wellesley College. By autumn he seemed to have recovered. In January 1881, he gave what would be his final public lecture, coincidentally at the Mercantile Library Association, the organization which hosted his first public reading.Tryon, Warren S. Parnassus Corner: A Life of James T. Fields, Publisher to the Victorians. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 379‚Äì380. Fields died in Boston on April 24, 1881. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His wife, Annie Fields, was devastated and demanded friends not mention him and she gradually cut herself off from others. Her friend, writer Celia Thaxter told her, \\"don't shut yourself away... or you will die a thousand deaths of silence.\\" Shortly after, she began a friendship with Sarah Orne Jewett, and the two became companions for the rest of their lives.Blanchard, Paula. Sarah Orne Jewett: Her World and Her Work. Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1994: 134. Writing In addition to his work as a publisher and essayist, Fields wrote poetry. A number of his works are collected in his book Ballads and Verses published in 1880. This volume contains the poem \\"The Ballad of the Tempest\\", which includes the famous lines: :\\"We are lost!\\" the captain shouted :As he staggered down the stairs His chief works were the collection of sketches and essays entitled Underbrush (1877) and the chapters of reminiscence composing Yesterdays with Authors (1871), in which he recorded his personal friendship with William Wordsworth, William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville and others. Legacy Grave of James T. Fields at Mount Auburn Cemetery Annie Adams Fields wrote the biography Memoir of James T. Fields, by his Wife (Boston, 1881) and Authors and Friends (Boston, 1896), which also mentions him. James T. Fields was known in his lifetime as one of the most successful and shrewd book promoters, working at a time when bribery was typical in the publishing culture. Hawthorne said he owed his success as a writer to him: \\"I care more for your good opinion than for that of a host of critics, and have excellent reason for so doing; inasmuch as my literary success, whatever it has been or may be, is the result of my connection with you\\". Fields was particularly successful as a publisher because of his ability to build close relationships with writers. As author Rebecca Harding Davis said, he was \\"the shrewdest of publishers and kindest of men. He was the wire that conducted the lightning so that it never struck amiss.\\"Felton, R. Todd. A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 28. He also knew the tastes of the reading public. Fields was reputedly able to ascertain what book a visitor to the Old Corner Bookstore would purchase within 10 minutes of arrival.Goodman, Susan and Carl Dawson. William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005: 122. After Fields's death, his friend Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote a poem called \\"Auf Wiedersehen\\" dedicated to him. Fields, along with Longfellow, is featured in the first and third of Matthew Pearl's novels, The Dante Club (2003) and The Last Dickens (2009). Fields is also mentioned in the 1994 film version of Little Women.

Early life Lu√≠sa Todi was born Lu√≠sa Rosa de Aguiar on 9 January 1753 in Set√∫bal, Portugal. In 1765, her family moved to Lisbon, where her father was a musical writer in the Theatre of Bairro Alto. Lu√≠sa began her career as an actress in 1767 or 1768 in Moli√®re's play Tartuffe. She met Francesco Saverio Todi, an Italian violinist, whom she married in 1769. After their marriage, on her husband's advice, she began having singing lessons with David Perez, an Italian composer and Music Master of the Portuguese Royal Chapel. In 1770, she began her career as a singer with Giuseppe Scolari's opera Il Viaggiatore Ridicolo, in the Theatre of Bairro Alto. From 1772 to 1777, Lu√≠sa lived in Porto, where she was a singer and a singing teacher and where she began to be recognized as an artist of stature. Rise to fame In the winter of 1777, at age 24, she gave her first performance abroad, at the King's Theatre in London. The enthusiastic critics said that \\"Mrs. Lu√≠sa Todi possesses high merit as singer and as actress.\\" In 1778 she sang at the famous Concerts Spirituels in Paris, winning a triumph and being considered the best foreign singer ever featured in France. She remained in France until 1780; then from 1780 to 1783, she sang at the Teatro Regio in Turin and gave performances in Germany and Austria in 1781. She returned to Paris for further Concerts Spirituels series, during which time a confrontation arose between Lu√≠sa Todi and the German soprano Gertrud Elisabeth Mara (1749‚Äì1833), which divided the public. Lu√≠sa Todi won this battle of rivals, being called by the French \\"the Nation's Singer\\". Life in Russia In 1784, Lu√≠sa travelled to Russia with her husband and children. They arrived at St. Petersburg on 7 June 1784 (27 May O.S.). On 10 June (30 May O.S.), Lu√≠sa gave her first concert, performing Giuseppe Sarti's Armida and Rinaldo. She was so impressive that at the end of that concert the Empress Catherine II presented her with two diamond bracelets. To express their gratitude, Lu√≠sa and her husband wrote the opera Pollinia and dedicated it to the Empress. The opera's premi√®re was in October, when Lu√≠sa performed with the famous castrato Luigi Marchesi (1754‚Äì1829). Marchesi, famous for his turbulent temperament, envied her success. He and the composer Sarti engaged in a campaign of rivalry against Lu√≠sa Todi. Empress Catherine took Lu√≠sa's side and declined to renew the contract of Marchesi and Sarti. Lu√≠sa Todi stayed for four years in Russia (1784‚Äì1788). She was the royal princesses' singing teacher, and Catherine II continued to present her with magnificent jewels of incalculable value. In 1788 Lu√≠sa was at Frederick William II of Prussia's court. The following year she returned to Paris for her third season of Concerts Spirituels and was considered by critics as \\"the greatest singer of her time.\\" She returned to the Prussian court a few weeks before the beginning of the French Revolution. Height of her career In 1790 she started a triumphant tour through Germany, and in Bonn she performed for Beethoven. At the end of that year, she travelled to Venice and performed at the Teatro San Samuele in the opera La Didone Abbandonata, wearing a tiara, necklace, and diamond earrings that had been given to her by the Russian Empress. In Venice, Lu√≠sa Todi attained one of the most glittering moments of her career; the Italian season of 1790/1791 became known as \\"Todi's Year\\". But during her stay in Venice, she started experiencing vision problems, which caused her to abandon the stage for some months. The Venetians expressed their concern and fans wrote hundreds of verses and poems in her honour. When Lu√≠sa returned to the stage in 1791, she was greeted with a rapturous ovation. She also toured other Italian cities. Between 1792 and 1796, she sang in Madrid at the . In April 1793, Lu√≠sa returned to Portugal. She required a special authorization to perform there, because at that time women were forbidden to appear on the public stage. In Lisbon she sang at a commemorative party for the Prince Regent's (the future John VI) daughter's birth. Sadly, her native country failed to recognize Lu√≠sa's outstanding talent, because her performance was not widely advertised and the Royal Family was absent from the event. After singing in Naples, she returned to Portugal in 1801, living in Porto. There she continued to sing until the death of her husband in 1803, when she retired and wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life. In 1809, Porto was invaded by the Napoleonic army commanded by General Soult. Lu√≠sa Todi decided to abandon the city, but during the escape she lost most of her belongings, including her priceless jewels. This caused financial problems during the last years of her life. Lu√≠sa Todi and her family were imprisoned by the French, but General Soult recognized her as \\"the Nation's Singer\\" and protected her. Death In 1811 she moved to Lisbon. By 1823, following her earlier vision problems, she had become completely blind. She died on 1 October 1833 after suffering a stroke the previous July. She was buried in the cemetery of the Church of the Incarnation, close to Chiado, in Lisbon. The cemetery area still exists today, underneath the foundations of a later building at 78 Rua do Alecrim. In spite of constant requests made by Todi enthusiasts and family descendants, one of the greatest Portuguese singers of all time remains buried beneath the pavement of an obscure cellar. Legacy Before her death, Lu√≠sa Todi saw her talent immortalized in Antoine Reicha's book Trait√© de melodie, where she is described as \\"the Singer of all Centuries\\". In modern Lisbon, the street in which Lu√≠sa Todi died was named Rua Lu√≠sa Todi in 1917. This is at the northern edge of Bairro Alto, just off Rua de S√£o Pedro de Alc√¢ntara above the church of S√£o Roque. She was also immortalized in her native city of Set√∫bal with a large monument and bust as well as the naming of Set√∫bal's biggest main avenue as Avenida Lu√≠sa Todi. Todi was praised for her vocal abilities, her clear diction, her linguistic skills (she spoke excellent French, English, Italian, and German), her professionalism, her talent as an actress, and the emotion and sensibility with which she infused her roles ‚Äì qualities that make her seem an extremely modern performer. These are the same qualities that have ensured that Lu√≠sa Todi is still remembered across the centuries.

Studies of usage in modern medicine began in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Galantamine was isolated for the first time from bulbs of Galanthus nivalis (common snowdrop) by the Bulgarian chemist D. Paskov and his team in 1956.Tewari D, Stankiewicz AM, Mocan A, Sah AN, Tzvetkov NT, Huminiecki L, Horba≈Ñczuk JO, Atanasov AG.

The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to its acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The first industrial process was developed in 1959. However, it was not until the 1990s when full-scale synthesis was upscaled and optimized. Since the alkaloid was isolated from a botanical source, it only had contents around 0.1%, which caused the yield to also be extremely low‚Äîin the single digits.Kim, J. K.; Park, S. U. Pharmacological aspects of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. EXCLI journal 2017, 16, 35-39. Uses in mythology In Homer's Odyssey the god Hermes gives Odysseus a herb with \\"a black root, but milklike flower\\" called \\"moly\\", which Hermes claims will make Odysseus immune to the sorceress Circe's drugs. It is believed that moly is the snowdrop Galanthus nivalis, which is a source of galantamine. The descriptions of moly given by Greek physician and herbalist Dioscorides support moly's identity as Galanthus nivalis. It has been proposed that the drugs Circe used were an extract from Datura stramonium (also known as jimsonweed), which causes memory loss and delirium. This would give a basis for the snowdrop's use as an antidote, as Datura stramonium is anticholinergic, while galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.  Medical uses  Galantamine is indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. In the United States, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia. As with other cholinesterase inhibitors, galantamine may not be effective for treating mild cognitive impairment. =Alzheimer's disease= Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the impairment of cholinergic function. One hypothesis is that this impairment contributes to the cognitive deficits caused by the disease. This hypothesis forms the basis for use of galantamine as a cholinergic enhancer in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Galantamine inhibits acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which hydrolyzes acetylcholine. As a result of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, galantamine increases the availability of acetylcholine for synaptic transmission. Additionally, galantamine binds to the allosteric sites of nicotinic receptors, which causes a conformational change. This allosteric modulation increases the nicotinic receptor's response to acetylcholine. The activation of presynaptic nicotinic receptors increases the release of acetylcholine, further increasing the availability of acetylcholine. Galantamine's competitive inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and allosteric nicotinic modulation serves as a dual mechanism of action. To reduce the prevalence of negative side effects associated with galantamine, such as nausea and vomiting, a dose-escalation scheme may be used. The use of a dose- escalation scheme has been well accepted in countries where galantamine is used. A dose-escalation scheme for Alzheimer's treatment involves a recommended starting dosage of 4 mg galantamine tablets given twice a day (8 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks, the dosage may then be increased to 8 mg given twice a day (16 mg/day). After a minimum of 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, the treatment may be increased to 12 mg given twice a day (24 mg/day). Dosage increases are based upon the assessment of clinical benefit as well as tolerability of the previous dosage. If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, the process is usually restarted, beginning at the starting dosage, and re-escalating to the current dose. It has been found that a dosage between 16‚Äì24 mg/day is the optimal dosage.Hager, K.; Baseman, A. S.; Nye, J. S.; Brashear, H. R.; Han, J.; Sano, M.; Davis, B.; Richards, H. M.

Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment 2014, 10, 391-401. = Available forms = The product is supplied in prescription form only in twice-a-day tablets, in once-a-day extended-release capsules, and in oral solution.  Side effects  Galantamine's side effect profile was similar to that of other cholinesterase inhibitors, with gastrointestinal symptoms being the most notable and most commonly observed. One study reports higher proportions of patients treated with galantamine experiencing nausea and vomiting as opposed to the placebo group. Another study using a dose- escalation treatment has found that incidences of nausea would decrease to baseline levels soon after each increase in administered dosage. In practice, some other cholinesterase inhibitors might be better tolerated; however, a careful and gradual titration over more than three months may lead to equivalent long-term tolerability. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and international health authorities have published an alert of galantamine based on data from two studies during the treatment for mild cognitive impairment (MCI); higher mortality rates were seen in drug-treated patients. On April 27, 2006, FDA approved labeling changes concerning all form of galantamine preparations (liquid, regular tablets, and extended release tablets) warning of the risk of bradycardia (slow resting heart rate), and sometimes atrioventricular block, especially in predisposed persons. At the same time, the risk of syncope (fainting) seems to be increased relative to placebo. \\"In randomized controlled trials, bradycardia was reported more frequently in galantamine-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients, but was rarely severe and rarely led to treatment discontinuation\\" These side effects have not been reported in Alzheimer's Disease related studies.  Pharmacology  Galantamine's chemical structure contains a tertiary amine. At a neutral pH, this tertiary amine will often bond to a hydrogen, and appear mostly as an ammonium ion. Galantamine is a potent allosteric potentiating ligand of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) Œ±4Œ≤2, Œ±3Œ≤4, and Œ±6Œ≤4, and chicken/mouse nAChRs Œ±7/5-HT3 in certain areas of the brain. By binding to the allosteric site of the nAChRs, a conformational change occurs which increases the receptors response to acetylcholine. This modulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors on cholinergic neurons in turn causes an increase in the amount of acetylcholine released. Galantamine also works as a weak competitive and reversible cholinesterase inhibitor in all areas of the body. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, it increases the concentration and thereby action of acetylcholine in certain parts of the brain. Galantamine's effects on nAChRs and complementary acetylcholinesterase inhibition make up a dual mechanism of action. It is hypothesized that this action might relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's. Galantamine's dual mechanism of action Galantamine in its pure form is a white powder. The atomic resolution 3D structure of the complex of galantamine and its target, acetylcholinesterase, was determined by X-ray crystallography in 1999 (PDB code: 1DX6; see complex). There is no evidence that galantamine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.  Pharmacokinetics  Absorption of galantamine is rapid and complete and shows linear pharmacokinetics. It is well absorbed with absolute oral bioavailability between 80 and 100%. It has a terminal elimination half-life of seven hours. Peak effect of inhibiting acetylcholinesterase was achieved about one hour after a single oral dose of 8 mg in some healthy volunteers. The coadministration of food delays the rate of galantamine absorption, but does not affect the extent of absorption. Plasma protein binding of galantamine is about 18%, which is relatively low.  Metabolism  Approximately 75% of a dose of galantamine is metabolised in the liver. In vitro studies have shown that Hepatic CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are involved in galantamine metabolism. Within 24 hours of intravenous or oral administration approximately 20% of a dose of galantamine will be excreted unreacted in the urine. In humans, several metabolic pathways for galantamine exist. These pathways lead to the formation of a number of different metabolites. One of the metabolites that may result can be formed through the glucuronidation of galantamine. Additionally, galantamine may undergo oxidation or demethylation at its nitrogen atom, forming two other possible metabolites. Galantamine can undergo demethylation at its oxygen atom, forming an intermediate which can then undergo glucuronidation or sulfate conjugation. Lastly, galantamine may be oxidized and then reduced before finally undergoing demethylation or oxidation at its nitrogen atom, or demethylation and subsequent glucuronidation at its oxygen atom. Metabolic pathways of galantamine For Razadyne ER, the once-a-day formulation, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had drug exposures that were approximately 50% higher than for extensive metabolizers. About 7% of the population has this genetic mutation; however, because the drug is individually titrated to tolerability, no specific dosage adjustment is necessary for this population. Drug interactions Since galantamine in metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, inhibiting either of these isoenzymes will increase the cholinergic effects of galantamine. Inhibiting these enzymes may lead to adverse effects. It was found that paroxetine, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 40%. The CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole and erythromycin increased the bioavailability of galantamine by 30% and 12%, respectively.  Synthesis  Galantamine is produced from natural resources, but also has many industrial syntheses. Companies such as Janssen, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Sanochemia Pharmazeutika, Shire, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company have industrial processes for synthesizing Galantamine. Research =Organophosphate poisoning= The toxicity of organophosphates results primarily from their action as irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase. Inhibiting acetylcholinesterase causes an increase in acetylcholine, as the enzyme is no longer available to catalyze its breakdown. In the peripheral nervous system, acetylcholine accumulation can cause an overstimulation of muscarinic receptors followed by a desensitization of nicotinic receptors. This leads to severe skeletal muscle fasciculations (involuntary contractions). The effects on the central nervous system include anxiety, restlessness, confusion, ataxia, tremors, seizures, cardiorespiratory paralysis, and coma. As a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, galantamine has the potential to serve as an effective organophosphate poisoning treatment by preventing irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Additionally, galantamine has anticonvulsant properties which may make it even more desirable as an antidote. Research supported in part by the US Army has led to a US patent application for the use of galantamine and/or its derivatives for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The indications for use of galantamine in the patent application include poisoning by nerve agents \\"including but not limited to soman, sarin, and VX, tabun, and Novichok agents\\". Galantamine was studied in the research cited in the patent application for use along with the well-recognized nerve agent antidote atropine. According to the investigators, an unexpected synergistic interaction occurred between galantamine and atropine in an amount of 6 mg/kg or higher. Increasing the dose of galantamine from 5 to 8 mg/kg decreased the dose of atropine needed to protect experimental animals from the toxicity of soman in dosages 1.5 times the dose generally required to kill half the experimental animals. =Autism= Galantamine given in addition to risperidone to autistic children has been shown to improve some of the symptoms of autism such as irritability, lethargy, and social withdrawal. Additionally, the cholinergic and nicotinic receptors are believed to play a role in attentional processes. Some studies have noted that cholinergic and nicotinic treatments have improved attention in autistic children. As such, it is hypothesized that galantamine's dual action mechanism might have a similar effect in treating autistic children and adolescents. =Anesthesia= Galantamine may have some limited use in reducing the side-effects of anesthetics ketamine and diazepam. In one study, a control group of patients were given ketamine and diazepam and underwent anesthesia and surgery. The experimental group was given ketamine, diazepam, and nivalin (of which the active ingredient is galantamine). The degree of drowsiness and disorientation of the two groups was then assessed 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes after surgery. The group that had taken nivalin were found to be more alert 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the surgery. = Lucid dreaming = Though not approved by the FDA, there is interest in the recreational use of galantamine for its purported ability to induce lucid dreaming. One study has provided some limited evidence for this practice, although it is notable that its authors have financial ties to the Lucidity Institute.

Among her writings are collections of poetry and essays as well as several memoirs and biographies of her literary acquaintances. She was also interested in philanthropic work, in which she found her greatest pleasure. Her later years were spent as a companion to author Sarah Orne Jewett.  Adolescence  Fields attended George B. Emerson's School for Young Ladies, Boston's most influential private secondary school for girls, where students were taught to read independently and trained to appreciate nature. She followed Emerson's advice about ongoing education by studying foreign languages, literature, nature, history, travel books, and biography, and cultivating one's \\"power of expression.\\" Upon his suggestion, Fields began to keep a diary, though she usually kept her own feelings out of it. She sometimes recorded good thoughts or beautiful images which are presented or suggested by observing, reading, or conversing, and she often concentrated on recording table talk of her, often, eminent guests. The fullest congruence of Emerson's advice to his students and Annie Field's activities stems from his repeated insistence that \\"every good life is necessarily devoted, directly or indirectly, to the service of mankind.\\" Biography =1834‚Äì1881= Annie Adams Fields She was born Ann West Adams in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 9, 1834, the sixth of seven children of Zabdiel Boylston Adams and Sarah May Holland Adams. Among her siblings was her brother Zabdiel Boylston Adams, Jr. As a girl, she was enrolled at the School for Young Ladies in Boston operated by George Barrell Emerson, where she was encouraged to read, learned Italian, developed an interest in self-expression, and came to appreciate nature. She married James Thomas Fields on November 15, 1854, in King's Chapel in Boston with a service conducted by Reverend Ezra Stiles Gannett. She was his second wife; his first was a cousin of hers. Her husband was a well-established and respected publisher and with him she encouraged up and coming writers such as Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman, and Emma Lazarus. She was equally at home with great and established figures including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Harriet Beecher Stowe, whose biography she compiled. At their home at 148 Charles Street in Boston, she established a regular literary salon where authors gathered. Fields was also a philanthropist and social reformer; in particular, she founded the Holly Tree Inns, coffeehouses serving inexpensive and nutritious meals, and the Lincoln Street Home, a safe and inexpensive residence for unmarried working women. Daguerreotype of American writer Annie Adams Fields (1834‚Äì1915). Fields and her husband became close personal friends with many of the authors with whom the publishing house worked, often hosting them at their home for dinner parties and overnight stays. In 1868, however, Fields's friend Mary Abigail Dodge (\\"Gail Hamilton\\") became suspicious of poor treatment by Ticknor and Fields and believed she deserved a higher royalty payment. James Fields initially ignored her complaints.Goodman, Susan. Republic of Words: The Atlantic Monthly and Its Writers 1857‚Äì1925. Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England, 2011: 70‚àí71. Dodge abruptly ended her friendship with Annie Fields in February. A month later, Fields recorded her distress over the situation in her journal: \\"We do not forget to feel still the savagery... of Gail Hamilton... I really thought she cared for me! And now to find it was a pretense or a stepping-stone merely is something to shudder over. And all for a little of this world's poor money!\\" After months of dispute, Dodge anonymously published A Battle of the Books in 1870 chronicling her negative experiences.Goodman, Susan. Republic of Words: The Atlantic Monthly and Its Writers 1857‚Äì1925. Lebanon, NH: University Press of New England, 2011: 71. =1881‚Äì1915= Fields in her Charles Street home's library with companion Sarah Orne Jewett, published 1922 After Fields's husband died in 1881, she continued to occupy the center of Boston literary life. The hallmark of Fields's work is a sympathetic understanding of her friends, who happened to be the leading literary figures of her time. Her closest friend was Sarah Orne Jewett, a novelist and story writer whom her husband had published in The Atlantic. Fields and Jewett lived together for the rest of Jewett's life (Jewett died in 1909). Jewett spent the winter of 1881‚Äì1882 with Fields at her Boston home immediately after her husband's death. From then on, they shared their homes for one another for about half the year. The two also traveled together, including in 1882 when they visited Ireland, England, Norway, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Italy together. During the trip, Fields's networks allowed them to meet with European authors like Charles Reade, William Makepeace Thackeray, and the family of Charles Dickens. They visited Europe again together in 1892, 1898, and 1900. Annie Adams Fields, a crayon portrait made by Samuel Worcester Rowse in 1833. There is speculation regarding the nature of their relationship. The English writer Mary Cowden Clarke referred to Fields and Jewett as a \\"woman-couple\\" but they were more commonly referred to as having a \\"Boston marriage\\". After her friend's death, Fields published Letters of Sarah Orne Jewett in 1911, though deeply personal passages were edited out after urging from their mutual friend Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe. Legacy Headstone of Annie Adams Fields at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, MA Fields died in 1915 and is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge, alongside her husband. Fields's literary importance lies primarily in two areas: one is the influence she exerted over her husband in the selection of works to be published by Ticknor and Fields, the major publishing house of the time. He valued her judgement as reflecting a woman's point of view. Second, Fields edited important collections of letters and biographical sketches. Her subjects included her husband, James T. Fields, John Greenleaf Whittier, Celia Thaxter, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, as well as the Jewett letter collection. While these are not critical, scholarly works (the Jewett collection, especially, is heavily edited), they do provide primary material for the researcher. Her book Authors and Friends (1896) is a series of sketches, the best of which are of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Celia Thaxter. Fields's diaries remain unpublished, except for excerpts published by M. A. DeWolfe Howe in 1922. She and her husband were friends with many of the main literary figures of their time, including Willa Cather, Mary Ellen Chase, William Dean Howells, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Alfred Tennyson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Mark Twain, Sarah Wyman Whitman, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Lydia Maria Child, Charles Dudley Warner and John Greenleaf Whittier. Fields remains a somewhat puzzling figure. Her writings reflect a traditional orientation toward sentimentalism and the cult of true womanhood. However, she was a supporter of \\"women's emancipation\\", and her association with Jewett and others suggests a less traditional side. She left for posterity a carefully polished public persona, that of the perfect hostess, the genteel lady, and it is difficult to find the real person underneath.

The tenants-in-chief were originally responsible for providing knights and soldiers for the king's feudal army.Bracton, who indiscriminately called tenants-in-chief \\"barons\\" stated: \\"sunt et alii potentes sub rege qui barones dicuntur, hoc est robur belli\\" (\\"there are other magnates under the king, who are called barons, that is the hardwood of war\\"), quoted in Sanders, I.J., Feudal Military Service in England, Oxford, 1956, p.3; \\"Bracton's definition of the baro\\" (plur barones) \\"proves that tenants of this class were considered to be the military backbone of the realm\\" (Sanders, p.3) Terminology The Latin term was tenens in capite.Coredon Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases p. 161 Other names for tenant-in-chief were \\"captal\\" or baron, although the latter term evolved in meaning. For example, the term \\"baron\\" was used in the Cartae Baronum of 1166, a return of all tenants-in-chief in England. At that time the term was understood to mean the \\"king's barons\\", or \\"king's men\\", because baron could still have a broader meaning. Originally, for example in Domesday Book (1086), there was a small number of powerful English tenants-in-chief under the Norman king who were all magnates directly associated with the king. Later, as laid- out by I. J. Sanders, the old tenancies-in-chief of England from the time of the last Norman king, King Henry I of England, came to have a legally distinct form of feudal land holding, the so-called tenure per baroniam. The term \\"baron\\" thus came to be used mainly for these \\"feudal barons\\", which comprised a group that over-lapped with the tenancies-in-chief, but was not identical. History In most countries allodial property could be held by laypeople or the Christian Church. However, in the Kingdom of England after the Norman Conquest, the king became in law the only holder of land by allodial title. Thus all the lands in England became the property of the Crown.Ganshof Feudalism p. 130Ganshof Feudalism p. 165 A tenure by frankalmoin, which in other countries was regarded as a form of privileged allodial holding, was in England regarded as a feudal tenement. Every land-holding was deemed by feudal custom to be no more than an estate in land, whether directly or indirectly held of the king. Absolute title in land could only be held by the king himself, the most anyone else could hold was a right over land, not a title in land per se. In England, a tenant-in-chief could enfief, or grant fiefs carved out of his own holding, to his own followers. The creation of subfiefs under a tenant-in-chief or other fief-holder was known as subinfeudation.Cosman Medieval Wordbook p. 240 The kings of the House of Normandy, however, eventually imposed on all free men who occupied a tenement(i.e. those whose tenures were \\"freehold\\", that is to say for life or heritable by their heirs), a duty of fealty to the crown rather than to their immediate lord who had enfeoffed them. This was to diminish the possibility of sub-vassals being employed by tenants-in-chief against the crown. In the great feudal survey Domesday Book (1087), tenants-in-chief were listed first in each English county's entry. The lands held by a tenant-in-chief in England, if comprising a large feudal barony, were called an honour.Ganshof Feudalism p. 166 Duties of tenants-in-chief As feudal lord, the king had the right to collect scutage from the barons who held these honours.Bartlett England under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 164 Scutage (literally shield money, from escutcheon) was a tax collected from vassals in lieu of military service. The payment of scutage rendered the crown more independent of the feudal levy and enabled it to pay for troops on its own. Once a tenant-in-chief received a demand for scutage, the cost was passed on to the sub-tenants and thus came to be regarded as a universal land tax. This tax was a development from the taxation system created under the Anglo-Saxon kings to raise money to pay off the invading Danes, the so-called Danegeld.Bartlett England under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 165 =Heirs= When an English tenant-in-chief died, an inquisition post mortem was held in each county in which he held land and his or her land temporarily escheated (i.e.reverted) to the demesne of the crown until the heir paid a sum of money (a relief), and was then able to take possession (livery of seisin) of the lands. However, if the heir was underage (under 21 for a male heir, under 14 for an heiress) they would be subject to a feudal wardship where the custody of their lands and the right to arrange their marriage passed to the monarch, until they came of age. The wardship and marriage was not usually kept in Crown hands, but was sold, often simply to the highest bidder, unless outbid by the next of kin.Court of Wards and Liveries: land inheritance 1540‚Äì1645 When an heir came of age, he or she passed out of wardship but could not enter upon their inheritance until, like all heirs of full age on inheritance, they had sued out their livery. In either case, the process was complicated. Eventually a warrant was issued for the livery to pass under the Great Seal. From its inception in 1540, The Court of Wards and Liveries administered the funds received from the wardships, marriages and the granting of livery; both courts and practice were abolished in 1646Friar Sutton Companion to Local History p. 465 and the whole system of feudal tenure ‚Äì except for fee simple ‚Äì was abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.

B ‚Äì Position where the second unexploded bomb was discovered lying on the casing; the bomb is represented by the tin can. C ‚Äì Gould stands in the casing-hatch through which bomb from A1 was dragged. Gould was 27 years old, and a petty officer in the Royal Navy during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 16 February 1942 north of Crete, in the Mediterranean, HM Submarine Thrasher, after attacking and sinking a supply ship, was itself attacked. Thrasher was subjected to a three-hour depth charge attack and aerial bombing. When after dark the submarine surfaced, two unexploded bombs were discovered in the gun-casing. Petty Officer Gould and Lieutenant Peter Scawen Watkinson Roberts volunteered to remove the bombs, which were of a type unknown to them. They removed the first one without too much difficulty, but the second bomb had penetrated the side plating of the gun emplacement, and then the deck casing above the pressure hull. Roberts and Gould entered the confined space (which was no more than high in places), and lying flat, wormed past deck supports, battery ventilators, and drop bollards. The petty officer then lay on his back with the 150 lb bomb in his arms while the lieutenant dragged him along by the shoulders. \\"It was then a matter of the two of us, lying horizontally, pushing and pulling the bomb back through the casing. It was pitch black and the bomb was making this horrible ticking noise while the submarine was being buffeted by the waves\\". They pushed and dragged the bomb for a distance of some until it could be lowered over the side. Every time the bomb was moved there was a loud twanging noise as of a broken spring which added nothing to their peace of mind. Thrasher was surfaced, stationary, and close inshore to enemy waters. If the submarine was forced to crash dive while they were in the casing, they must have been drowned. It was 50 minutes before they got the bomb clear, wrapped it in sacking, and dropped it over the side. In August 1943 he received a Mention in Despatches after the submarine Truculent sank U-308 off the Faroes on 4 June 1943.

Early life Gratwick was born in Katanning, Western Australia on 19 October 1902, the fifth son of the local postmaster. Leaving school at the age of 16, he took up various jobs which included a period as a messenger at Parliament House. Later he worked as a blacksmith, a drover and a prospector. Second World War Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Gratwick attempted to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). However, issues with his nose, which had been broken years earlier, led to the rejection of his application. In late 1940, after expensive medical treatment on his nose, he attempted to enlist again, this time successfully. Following completion of his training in July 1941, Gratwick embarked for Libya, where he was assigned to the 2/48th Battalion (a South Australian unit) with the rank of private. The battalion was among the defenders of Tobruk but was transferred to Palestine in October 1941. By June 1942, the battalion was in Egypt. On the night of 25/26 October 1942 during the attack at Miteiriya Ridge, Egypt, the platoon to which Gratwick belonged suffered considerable casualties, including the platoon commander and sergeant. Gratwick, realising the seriousness of the situation, charged a German machine-gun position by himself, and killed the crew with hand grenades. He also killed a mortar crew. Under heavy machine-gun fire Gratwick then charged a second post, using his rifle and bayonet. In inflicting further casualties he was killed by machine-gun fire, but his brave and determined action, for which he would be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, enabled his company to capture the final objective. Gratwick is buried in El Alamein Commonwealth cemetery, and his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Museum of Western Australia in Fremantle, Western Australia. In Port Hedland, Western Australia, Gratwick Street, the Gratwick Aquatic Centre and the town theatre and community hall are all named in his honour.

Early life Lorne MacLaine Campbell was born on 22 July 1902 in Airds, Argyll, Scotland, the eldest of three sons of Colonel Ian Maxwell Campbell and Hilda Mary Wade. He was schooled at the Dulwich College Preparatory School, and then at Dulwich College in South London between 1915 and 1921 (as was his uncle and fellow recipient of the Victoria Cross, Vice Admiral Gordon Campbell). Between 1921 and 1925 he attended Merton College, Oxford, where he was President of the Junior Common Room and of the Myrmidon Club and graduated with a second class degree in Literae Humaniores. Military service Campbell was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Territorial Army) on 23 September 1921. =Second World War= In August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Campbell's unit, the 8th (Argyllshire) Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders was mobilised for war service. Serving as part of the 154th Infantry Brigade, which also included the 7th Battalion, Argylls and the 6th Battalion, Black Watch, of Major General Victor Fortune's 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, the battalion endured months of training before departing for service overseas in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in January 1940. During the Battle of France in May‚ÄìJune 1940 Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for gallant leadership during the 51st Division's entrapment at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, where most of the division, including the divisional commander, Major General Fortune, were captured, although most of the 154th Brigade and some supporting units managed to escape capture and return to Scotland. After returning the battalion, which had suffered very heavy losses, was reformed with large numbers of reinforcements. In 1942 he became Commanding Officer of the 7th Battalion, Argylls (although it was then designated as the 7th/10th Battalion), still serving as part of the 154th Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division, reformed in August 1940 by the redesignation of the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Douglas Wimberley and led the battalion overseas to North Africa in August 1942. At the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942, he received a Bar to his DSO for his part in the capture of important objectives. He led the battalion, after El Alamein, throughout the Tunisian Campaign, at El Agheila, in the capture of the Libyan port of Tripoli, Medenine, and Wadi Akarit, where Campbell gained his Victoria Cross. On 28 April, shortly before the campaign came to an end, Campbell became acting commander of the 153rd Brigade. On 20 May Campbell was promoted to the acting rank of brigadier and took command of the 13th Infantry Brigade, part of the 5th Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Horatio Berney- Ficklin. The brigade, a Regular Army formation, was then serving in Syria, later moving to Egypt, before taking part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, from July until mid-August. After a brief rest, the brigade, and the rest of the division (now under Major General Gerard Bucknall), participated in the Allied invasion of Italy, Campbell leading the brigade throughout the 5th Division's involvement in the Italian Campaign, seeing service during the Moro River Campaign, the Battle of Monte Cassino, and the Battle of Anzio, before leaving Italy in early July 1944 to return to Egypt, later Palestine, to rest and refit. For eight days in April, he was acting General Officer Commanding of the 5th Division, when the division was in the Anzio beachhead, in place of Major General Philip Gregson-Ellis. Relinquishing command of the brigade in September, Campbell ended the war in the United States, in Washington D.C. as a brigadier with the British Army Staff. Victoria Cross Campbell was a 40 years old temporary lieutenant colonel in the 7th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), British Army, during the Second World War at Wadi Akarit in Tunisia.

He was 30 years old when he performed the deed for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. On the evening of 16 March 1944, the South Staffords dug in near what would become a main hinge of the Chindit operation, the block at Henu and Mawlu, known as the White City. A nearby hill crowned with a Pagoda dominated the horizon. It was not occupied by the British or, so far as those present could tell, by the Japanese. The following morning a number of unsuspecting Japanese soldiers were discovered in the area. It was plain that the South Staffords had dug in their positions adjacent to a small Japanese force without either learning of the other's presence. At about 11:00am, the hill erupted with enemy fire.Bidwell, 1979: 118‚Äì19 Calvert, who led the attack in person, wrote \\"On the top of Pagoda Hill, not much bigger than two tennis courts, an amazing scene developed.

After long and difficult discussions, which lasted 3 days, and despite the strong opposition of Queen Marie and General Constantin Prezan, the Crown Council decided to accept the ultimatum and send envoys to Buftea to negotiate a preliminary peace treaty. The preliminary peace treaty was concluded on , by which Romania accepted frontier rectifications in favor of Austria-Hungary, to cede the whole of Dobruja, to demobilize at least 8 divisions, to evacuate the Austro-Hungarian territory still in its possession and to allow the transport of Central Powers' troops through Western Moldavia and Bessarabia towards Odessa.Nicolae Iorga, Acte privitoare la istoria marelui rƒÉzboiu, ‚ÄûRevista IstoricƒÉ\\", Year XVIII, Issues 7-9, Bucharest, 1932 Alexandru Marghiloman, then Prime Minister of Romania, signed the final treaty at the Cotroceni Palace, Bucharest, on and it was ratified by the Chamber of Deputies on 28 June and by the Senate on 4 July 1918. However, King Ferdinand refused to sign or promulgate it. Terms * Romania and the Central Powers declared the end of the state of war between them and that the diplomatic and consular relations between them would be resumed. * Demobilization of the Romanian forces ** Of Romania's 15 infantry divisions, divisions 11th to 15th were to be disbanded. Of the remaining 10 divisions, the two in Bessarabia were allowed to remain on a war footing, together with the ' battalions left over from the disbanded chasseur divisions, as well as the two Romanian cavalry divisions, until the military operations carried out by the Central Powers in Ukraine would eliminate the danger at the Romanian eastern frontier. The remaining eight divisions would remain on a reduced peace footing: four infantry regiments of three battalions each, two cavalry regiments of two squadrons each, two field artillery regiments of seven batteries each, one battalion of pioneers and the necessary technical troops and convoys. The total force of these eight infantry divisions could not exceed 20,000 men, that of the cavalry 3,200 men and that of the artillery 9,000 men. The divisions in Bessarabia were also to be decreased, in case of demobilization, to the peace footing on the basis of the eight divisions mentioned above. ** The ordnance, machine guns, hand arms, horses, wagons and munitions made available during the reduction or disbanding of the Romanian troops were to be transferred to the high command of the Central Powers' forces and to be guarded by Romanian depot troops. Ammunition left with the Romanian divisions on peace footing was limited to 250 cartridges per musket, 2500 cartridges per machine gun, and 150 shots for each piece of ordnance. The divisions mobilized in Bessarabia were allowed to retain their ammunition needed for the state of war. ** The demobilized troops were to remain in Moldavia until the evacuation of the occupied Romanian territory by the Central Powers, with the exception of the depot troops mentioned at article V. The troops in active service had to secure the permission of the Central Powers' high command if they wanted to pass into the occupied territory. ** Romania and the Central Powers would appoint an officer from their respective General Staff as liaison officer to the other party. ** The Romanian fluvial and maritime forces were allowed to remain intact until the conditions in Bessarabia were cleared up, afterwards they were to be reduced to a peace footing status, except for the fluvial and naval forces needed to protect the commercial navigation and the reestablishment of navigable lanes. The military and naval personnel who in peace time was employed in the ports and in navigation was to be demobilized first, so that they could resume their former activity. * Cession of Romanian territory ** Romania returned Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) and ceded the southern part of Northern Dobruja (see the maps) to Bulgaria. The rest of the province (starting south of CernavodƒÉ-Constan»õa railroad up to the Danube and the Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe branch, thus leaving the Danube Delta to Romania) was ceded by Romania to the Central Powers and thus remained under joint Central Powers' control. The Central Powers guaranteed the commercial road to the Black Sea for Romania by way of CernavodƒÉ and Constan»õa. ** Romania gave to Austria- Hungary control of the passes of the Carpathian Mountains (see the maps). ** State properties in the territories ceded by Romania passed without indemnity to the acquiring states. The acquiring states were to enter with Romania into agreements over the rights of option and emigration for the Romanian inhabitants in the ceded territories, the apportionment of the properties of the communal districts severed by the new frontiers, the attribution of archives, of judicial, administrative and personal civil records, the management of the new frontiers, the effect of the new frontiers upon the dioceses and the political treaties. * All parties renounce war indemnities, except for special agreements regarding the regulation of war damages. * Romania leased its oil wells to Germany for 90 years. * The Central Powers recognized the Union of Bessarabia with Romania.R.

Aftermath The treaty put Romania in a unique situation compared to other German-occupied countries. It completely respected Romania's de jure independence, and Romania ended up with more territory after the union with Bessarabia, through the requirement that German civil servants with the power of veto power be stationed in Bucharest together with the German occupation to continue until a date \\"later be determined\\", effectively turned Romania into a de facto German protectorate. Germany was able to repair the oil fields around Ploie»ôti and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.John Keegan, World War I, pg. 308 Although Bulgaria received a part of Northern Dobruja, the fact that it could not annex the whole province had a strong effect on the Bulgarian public opinion. Bulgarian Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov was forced to resign on 20 July 1918 after the failure to acquire the whole Dobruja. Nevertheless, Bulgaria continued to lobby Germany and Austria-Hungary for the annexation of the whole province, including the condominium established by the Treaty of Bucharest. Representatives of Bulgarian Dobrujans held a second general assembly in Babadag on 23 September, adopting a final resolution requesting Dobruja's incorporation into Bulgaria. After negotiations, a protocol regarding the transfer of the jointly administered zone in Northern Dobruja to Bulgaria was signed in Berlin on 24 September 1918, by Germany, Austria- Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. In return, Bulgaria agreed to cede the left bank of the Maritsa river to Turkey. The protocol was deemed a desperate attempt by the Central Powers to keep Bulgaria on their side during the Vardar Offensive on the Macedonian front. In the end, the agreement was short-lived: five days later, on 29 September, Bulgaria capitulated in the face of the advancing Allied forces (see also the Armistice of Salonica). The treaty was denounced in October 1918 by the Marghiloman government. Romania re-entered the war on 10 November 1918, the day before it ended in Western Europe, and the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the Armistice of 11 November 1918., Article XV. In 1919, Germany was forced in the Treaty of Versailles to renounce all the benefits provided by the 1918 Treaty of Bucharest.Articles 248‚Äì263 - World War I Document Archive The territorial transfers to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria were annulled by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919), and the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine (1919), respectively; and the Treaty of Trianon (1920) settled Romania's border with Hungary.

Born in Vermont, Griswold left home when he was 15 years old. He worked as a journalist, editor, and critic in Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. He built up a strong literary reputation, in part due to his 1842 collection The Poets and Poetry of America. This anthology, the most comprehensive of its time, included what he deemed the best examples of American poetry. He produced revised versions and similar anthologies for the remainder of his life, although many of the poets he promoted have since faded into obscurity. Many writers hoped to have their work included in one of these editions, although they commented harshly on Griswold's abrasive character. Griswold was married three times: his first wife died young, his second marriage ended in a public and controversial divorce, and his third wife left him after the previous divorce was almost repealed. Edgar Allan Poe, whose poetry had been included in Griswold's anthology, published a critical response that questioned which poets were included. This began a rivalry which grew when Griswold succeeded Poe as editor of Graham's Magazine at a salary higher than Poe's. Later, the two competed for the attention of poet Frances Sargent Osgood. They never reconciled their differences and, after Poe's mysterious death in 1849, Griswold wrote an unsympathetic obituary. Claiming to be Poe's chosen literary executor, he began a campaign to harm Poe's reputation that lasted until his own death eight years later. Griswold considered himself an expert in American poetry and was an early proponent of its inclusion on the school curriculum. He also supported the introduction of copyright legislation, speaking to Congress on behalf of the publishing industry, although he was not above infringing the copyright of other people's work. A fellow editor remarked, \\"even while haranguing the loudest, [he] is purloining the fastest\\".Moss, 80‚Äì81 Life and career =Early life= Griswold was born to Rufus and Deborah (Wass) Griswold on February 13, 1815,Bayless, 5 in Vermont, near Rutland, and raised a strict CalvinistMeyers, 125 in the hamlet of Benson.Silverman, 212 He was the twelfth of fourteen children and his father was a farmer and shoemaker. In 1822, the family sold the Benson farm and moved to nearby Hubbardton.Bayless, 5‚Äì6 As a child, Griswold was complex, unpredictable, and reckless.Bayless, 7 He left home when he was 15, calling himself a \\"solitary soul, wandering through the world, a homeless, joyless outcast\\".Tomc, Sandra. \\"Poe and His Circle\\". Collected in The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe, Kevin J. Hayes, ed. Cambridge University Press, 2002: 26. . Griswold moved to Albany, New York, to live with a 22-year-old flute-playing journalist named George C. Foster, a writer best known for his work New-York by Gas-Light. Griswold lived with Foster until he was 17, and the two may have had a romantic relationship. When Griswold moved away, Foster wrote to him begging him to return, signing his letter \\"come to me if you love me\\".Bayless, 10 Griswold attempted to enroll at the Rensselaer School in 1830, but was not allowed to take any classes after he was caught attempting to play a prank on a professor.Bayless, 8 Griswold, circa 1840 =Early career and first marriage= After a brief spell as a printer's apprentice, Griswold moved to Syracuse where, with some friends, he started a newspaper called The Porcupine. This publication purposefully targeted locals for what was later remembered as merely malicious critique.Bayless, 12‚Äì13 He moved to New York City in 1836 and, in March of that year, was introduced to 19-year-old Caroline Searles, whom he later married.Bayless, 15 He was employed as an editor for various publications in the New York area. In October, he considered running for office as a Whig but did not receive the party's support.Bayless, 17‚Äì18 In 1837 he was licensed as a Baptist clergyman, although he never had a permanent congregation. Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837,Bayless, 20 and the couple had two daughters. Following the birth of their second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia.Silverman, 213 His departure on November 27, 1840,Quinn, 350 was by all accounts abrupt, leaving his job with Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and his library of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and began to build his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness. On November 6, 1842, Griswold visited his wife in New York after she had given birth to their third child, a son. Three days later, after returning to Philadelphia, he was informed that both she and the infant had died. Deeply shocked, Griswold traveled by train alongside her coffin, refusing to leave her side for 30 hours. When fellow passengers urged him to try to sleep, he answered by kissing her dead lips and embracing her, his two children crying next to him.Bayless, 64 He refused to leave the cemetery after her funeral, even after the other mourners had left, until forced to do so by a relative.Silverman, 217Bayless, 65 He wrote a long poem in blank verse dedicated to Caroline, \\"Five Days\\", which was printed in the New York Tribune on November 16, 1842.Bayless, 66 Griswold had difficulty believing she had died and often dreamed of their reunion. Forty days after her entombment, he entered her vault, cut off a lock of her hair, kissed her on the forehead and lips, and wept for several hours, staying by her side until a friend found him 30 hours later. =Anthologist and critic= Title page of the 1855 edition of The Poets and Poetry of America In 1842, Griswold released his 476-page anthology of American poetry, The Poets and Poetry of America, which he dedicated to Washington Allston.Pattee, 279 Griswold's collection featured poems from over 80 authors,Sova, 197 including 17 by Lydia Sigourney, three by Edgar Allan Poe, and 45 by Charles Fenno Hoffman. Hoffman, a close friend, was allotted twice as much space as any other author.Pattee, 494 Griswold went on to oversee many other anthologies, including Biographical Annual, which collected memoirs of \\"eminent persons recently deceased\\", Gems from American Female Poets, Prose Writers of America, and Female Poets of America.Quinn, 350‚Äì351 Between 1842 and 1845 while Griswold was collecting material for Prose Writers of America he discovered the identity of Horace Binney Wallace, who had been writing in various literary magazines at the time (including Burton's) under the pen name William Landor. Wallace declined to be included in the anthology but the two became friends, exchanging many letters over the years.Hatvary, George E. Wallace, Horace Binney, 1817‚Äì1852: Criticism and Interpretation Ardent Media: 20. . Wallace eventually ghostwrote Griswold's Napoleon and the Marshals of the Empire (1847).Hatvary, George E. Wallace, Horace Binney, 1817‚Äì1852: Criticism and Interpretation. Ardent Media, 1977: 11. . Prose Writers of America, published in 1847, was prepared specifically to compete with a similar anthology by Cornelius Mathews and Evert Augustus Duyckinck.Miller, 169 The prose collection earned Griswold a rivalry with the two men, which Griswold expected. As it was being published, Griswold wrote to Boston publisher James Thomas Fields that \\"Young America will be rabid\\".Widmer, Edward L. Young America: The Flowering of Democracy in New York. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999: 121. . In preparing his anthologies, Griswold would write to the living authors whose work he was including to ask their suggestions on which poems to include, as well as to gather information for a biographical sketch.Pattee, 391 In 1843 Griswold founded The Opal, an annual gift book that collected essays, stories, and poetry. Nathaniel Parker Willis edited its first edition, which was released in the fall of 1844.Bayless, 83 For a time, Griswold was editor of the Saturday Evening PostOberholtzer, Ellis Paxson. The Literary History of Philadelphia. Philadelphia: George W. Jacobs & Co., 1906: 298. . and also published a collection of poetry, The Cypress Wreath (1844). His poems, with titles such as \\"The Happy Hour of Death\\", \\"On the Death of a Young Girl\\", and \\"The Slumber of Death\\", emphasized mortality and mourning.Kennedy, J. Gerald. Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing. Yale University Press, 1987: 66‚Äì67. . Another collection of his poetry, Christian Ballads and Other Poems, was published in 1844, and his nonfiction book, The Republican Court or, American Society in the Days of Washington, was published in 1854.Bayless, 234 The book is meant to cover events during the presidency of George Washington, though it mixes historical fact with apocryphal legend until one is indistinguishable from the other.Bryan, William Alfred. George Washington in American Literature 1775‚Äì1865. New York: Columbia University Press, 1952: 103. During this period, Griswold occasionally offered his services at the pulpit delivering sermonsBayless, 93 and he may have received an honorary doctorate from Shurtleff College, a Baptist institution in Illinois, leading to his nickname the \\"Reverend Dr. Griswold\\".No records from the college authenticating this claim exist. Bayless, 274 Daguerreotype portrait of Charlotte Myers Griswold =Second marriage= On August 20, 1845, Griswold married Charlotte Myers, a Jewish woman;Bayless, 107 she was 42 and he was 33.Silverman, 342 Griswold had been pressured into the marriage by the woman's aunts, despite his concern about their difference in religious beliefs. This difference was strong enough that one of Griswold's friends referred to his wife only as \\"the little Jewess\\".Silverman, 354 On their wedding night, he discovered that she was, according to Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, \\"through some physical misfortune, incapable of being a wife\\"Bayless, 108 or, as Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman explains, incapable of having sex. Griswold considered the marriage void and no more valid \\"than there would have been had the ceremony taken place between parties of the same sex, or where the sex of one was doubtful or ambiguous\\". Still, the couple moved together to Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte's home town, and lived under the same roof, albeit sleeping in separate rooms. Neither of the two was happy with the situation, and at the end of April 1846 she had a lawyer write up a contract \\"to separate, altogether and forever, ... which would in effect be a divorce\\".Bayless, 111 The contract forbade Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 for expenses in exchange for his daughter Caroline staying with the Myers family.Bayless, 111‚Äì112 After this separation, Griswold immediately moved back to Philadelphia. =Move to New York City= A few years later, Griswold moved back to New York City, leaving his younger daughter in the care of the Myers family and his elder daughter, Emily, with relatives on her mother's side. He had by now earned the nickname \\"Grand Turk\\", and in the summer of 1847 made plans to edit an anthology of poetry by American women.Bayless, 143 He believed that women were incapable of the same kind of \\"intellectual\\" poetry as men and believed they needed to be divided: \\"The conditions of aesthetic ability in the two sexes are probably distinct, or even opposite\\", he wrote in his introduction.Watts, Emily Stipes. The Poetry of American Women from 1632 to 1945. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1977: 70‚Äì71. The selections he chose for The Female Poets of America were not necessarily the greatest examples of poetry but instead were chosen because they emphasized traditional morality and values.Watts, Emily Stipes. The Poetry of American Women from 1632 to 1945. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1978: 73. That same year, Griswold began working on what he considered \\"the maximum opus of his life\\", an extensive biographical dictionary. Although he worked on it for several years and even advertised for it, it was never produced.Bayless 201 He also helped Elizabeth F. Ellet publish her book Women of the American Revolution, and was angered when she did not acknowledge his assistance in the book.Bayless, 143‚Äì144 In July 1848, he visited poet Sarah Helen Whitman in Providence, Rhode Island, although he had been suffering with vertigo and exhaustion, rarely leaving his apartment at New York University, and was unable to write without taking opium. In autumn of that year, he had an epileptic fit, the first of many he would suffer for the remainder of his life. One fit caused him to fall out of a ferry in Brooklyn and nearly drown.Silverman, 441 He wrote to publisher James T. Fields: \\"I am in a terrible condition, physically and mentally. I do not know what the end will be ... I am exhausted--betwixt life and death--and heaven and hell.\\" In 1849, he was further troubled when Charles Fenno Hoffman, with whom he had become good friends, was committed to an insane asylum.Bayless, 149 Griswold continued editing and contributing literary criticism for various publications, both full-time and freelance, including 22 months from July 1, 1850, to April 1, 1852, with The International Magazine.Bayless, 205 There, he worked with contributors including Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Mary E. Hewitt and John R. Thompson.Bayless, 206‚Äì207 In the November 10, 1855, issue of The Criterion, Griswold anonymously reviewed the first edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, declaring: \\"It is impossible to image how any man's fancy could have conceived such a mass of stupid filth\\". Griswold charged that Whitman was guilty of \\"the vilest imaginings and shamefullest license\\", a \\"degrading, beastly sensuality.\\" Referring to Whitman's poetry, Griswold said he left \\"this gathering of muck to the laws which ... must have the power to suppress such gross obscenity.\\"Jonathan Ned Katz, Love Stories: Sex Between Men Before Homosexuality (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), 105‚Äì106 Whitman later included Griswold's review in a new edition of Leaves of Grass.Loving, 184‚Äì185 He ended his review with a phrase in Latin referring to \\"that horrible sin, among Christians not to be named\\", the stock phrase long associated with Christian condemnations of sodomy, referring in this instance to homosexual, rather than heterosexual sodomy. Griswold was the first person in the 19th century to publicly point to and stress the theme of erotic desire and acts between men in Whitman's poetry. More attention to that aspect of Whitman's poetry would only surface late in the 19th century.Katz, 105‚Äì106; Loving, 202 =Divorce and third marriage= After a brief flirtation with poet Alice Cary, Griswold pursued a relationship with Harriet McCrillis. He originally did not want to divorce Charlotte Myers because he \\"dreaded the publicity\\" and because of her love for his daughter.Bayless, 212 He applied for divorce at the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia on March 25, 1852.Bayless, 217 Elizabeth Ellet and Ann S. Stephens wrote to Myers urging her not to grant the divorce, and to McCrillis not to marry him.Bayless, 220 To convince Myers to agree to the divorce, Griswold allowed her to keep his daughter Caroline if she signed a statement that she had deserted him.Bayless, 221 She agreed and the divorce was made official December 18; he likely never saw Myers or his daughter again.Bayless, 222 McCrillis and Griswold were married shortly thereafter on December 26, 1852, and settled at 196 West Twenty-third Street in New York.Bayless, 223 Their son, William, was born on October 9, 1853.Bayless, 226 Ellet and Stephens continued writing to Griswold's ex-wife, urging her to have the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal.Bayless, 227 Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, nearly died in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49 corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.Bayless, 251 =Death= Griswold died of tuberculosis in New York City on August 27, 1857.Bayless, 253 Estelle Anna Lewis, a friend and writer, suggested that the interference of Elizabeth Ellet had exacerbated Griswold's condition and that she \\"goaded Griswold to his death\\".Phillips, Mary E. Edgar Allan Poe: The Man. Volume II. Chicago: The John C. Winston Co., 1926: 1575 At the time of his death, the sole decorations found in his room were portraits of himself, Frances Osgood, and Poe.Rosenheim, Shawn James. The Cryptographic Imagination: Secret Writing from Edgar Poe to the Internet. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997: 123. . A friend, Charles Godfrey Leland, found in Griswold's desk several documents attacking a number of authors which Griswold was preparing for publication. Leland decided to burn them.Quinn, 692 Griswold's funeral was held on August 30. His pallbearers included Leland, Charles Frederick Briggs, George Henry Moore, and Richard Henry Stoddard. His remains were left for eight years in the receiving tomb of Green-Wood Cemetery before being buried on July 12, 1865, without a headstone.Bayless, 255 Although his library of several thousand volumes was auctioned off, raising over $3,000 to be put towards a monument, none was ever commissioned. Reputation and influence Engraving from an 1855 edition of The Poets and Poetry of America Griswold's anthology The Poets and Poetry of America was the most comprehensive of its kind to date. As critic Lewis Gaylord Clark said, it was expected Griswold's book would \\"become incorporated into the permanent undying literature of our age and nation\\". The anthology helped Griswold build up a considerable reputation throughout the 1840s and 1850sMeyers, 126 and its first edition went through three printings in only six months. His choice of authors, however, was occasionally questioned. A British editor reviewed the collection and concluded, \\"with two or three exceptions, there is not a poet of mark in the whole Union\\" and referred to the anthology as \\"the most conspicuous act of martyrdom yet committed in the service of the transatlantic muses\\".Bayless, 90 Even so, the book was popular and was even continued in several editions after Griswold's death by Richard Henry Stoddard. In more modern times, The Poets and Poetry of America has been nicknamed a \\"graveyard of poets\\" because its anthologized writers have since passed into obscurityBayless, 247 to become, as literary historian Fred Lewis Pattee wrote, \\"dead ... beyond all resurrection\\". Pattee also called the book a \\"collection of poetic trash\\" and \\"voluminous worthlessness\\".Pattee, 363 Within the contemporary American literary scene Griswold became known as erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive. As historian Perry Miller wrote, \\"Griswold was about as devious as they came in this era of deviousness; did not ample documentation prove that he actually existed, we might suppose him ... one of the less plausible inventions of Charles Dickens\\".Miller, 168 Later anthologies such as Prose Writers of America and Female Poets of America helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power.Quinn, 351 Even as they tried to impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and \\"constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth\\".Silverman, 216‚Äì217 Even his friends knew him as a consummate liar and had a saying: \\"Is that a Griswold or a fact?\\"Miller, 204 Another friend once called him \\"one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met\\". Author Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning \\"the poor little innocent fishes\\" to avoid his \\"Griswold Hook\\".Miller, 211 A review of one of Griswold's anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia Saturday Museum on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe,Quinn, 354 asked: \\"What will be [Griswold's] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to tell that he once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust.\\"James Harrison, ed., The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe, New York: T. Y. Crowell, 1902, vol XVII. 220‚Äì243 James Russell Lowell, who had privately called Griswold \\"an ass and, what's more, a knave\\", composed a verse on Griswold's temperament in his satirical A Fable for Critics: :But stay, here comes Tityrus Griswold, and leads on :The flocks whom he first plucks alive, and then feeds on‚Äî :A loud-cackling swarm, in whose feathers warm dressed, :He goes for as perfect a ‚Äì swan as the rest.Pattee, 389 Griswold was one of the earliest proponents of teaching schoolchildren American poetry in addition to English poetry. One of his anthologies, Readings in American Poetry for the Use of Schools, was created specifically for that purpose.Bayless, 79 His knowledge in American poetry was emphasized by his claim that he had read every American poem published before 1850‚Äîan estimated 500 volumes.Brooks, Van Wyck. The Flowering of New England. New York: E. P. Dutton and Company, Inc., 1952: 520 \\"He has more literary patriotism, if the phrase be allowable ... than any person we ever knew\\", wrote a contributor to Graham's. \\"Since the Pilgrims landed, no man or woman has written anything on any subject which has escaped his untiring research.\\" Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. noted that Griswold researched literature like \\"a kind of naturalist whose subjects are authors, whose memory is a perfect fauna of all flying and creeping things that feed on ink.\\" Evert Augustus Duyckinck commented that \\"the thought [of a national literature] seems to have entered and taken possession of [Griswold's] mind with the force of monomania\\".Lewis, R. W. B. The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1955: 81. Poet Philip Pendleton Cooke questioned Griswold's sincerity, saying he \\"should have loved [it] ... better than to say it\\".Parks, Edd Winfield. Ante-Bellum Southern Literary Critics. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1962: 303. By the 1850s, Griswold's literary nationalism had subsided somewhat, and he began following the more popular contemporary trend of reading literature from England, France, and Germany. He disassociated himself from the \\"absurd notion ... that we are to create an entirely new literature\\". Publicly, Griswold supported the establishment of international copyright, although he himself often duplicated entire works during his time as an editor, particularly with The Brother Jonathan. A contemporary editor said of him, \\"He takes advantage of a state of things which he declares to be 'immoral, unjust and wicked,' and even while haranguing the loudest, is purloining the fastest.\\" Even so, he was chosen to represent the publishing industry before Congress in the spring of 1844 to discuss the need for copyright law. Relationship with Poe 1848 Daguerreotype of Edgar Allan Poe at 39, a year before his death Griswold first met Edgar Allan Poe in Philadelphia in May 1841 while working for the Daily Standard.Silverman, 211 At the outset, their relationship was cordial, at least superficially. In a letter dated March 29, 1841, Poe sent Griswold several poems for The Poets and Poetry of America anthology, writing that he would be proud to see \\"one or two of them in the book\\". Griswold included three of these poems: \\"Coliseum\\", \\"The Haunted Palace\\", and \\"The Sleeper\\". In November of that year, Poe, who had previously praised Griswold in his \\"Autography\\" series as \\"a gentleman of fine taste and sound judgment\\", wrote a critical review of the anthology, on Griswold's behalf. Griswold paid Poe for the review and used his influence to have it published in a Boston periodical. The review was generally favorable, although Poe questioned the inclusion of certain authors and the omission of others.Silverman, 215‚Äì216 Poe also said that Griswold \\"unduly favored\\" New England writers.Omans, Glen A. \\"Poe and Washington Allston: Visionary Kin\\", collected in Poe and His Times: The Artist and His Milieu, edited by Benjamin Franklin Fisher IV. Baltimore: The Edgar Allan Poe Society, 1990: 24. . Griswold had expected more praise and Poe privately told others he was not particularly impressed by the book,Silverman, 216 even calling it \\"a most outrageous humbug\\" in a letter to a friend.Quinn, 352 In another letter, this time to fellow writer Frederick W. Thomas, Poe suggested that Griswold's promise to help get the review published was actually a bribe for a favorable review, knowing Poe needed the money.Quinn, 353 Making the relationship even more strained, only months later, Griswold was hired by George Rex Graham to take up Poe's former position as editor of Graham's Magazine. Griswold, however, was paid more and given more editorial control of the magazine than Poe. Shortly after, Poe began presenting a series of lectures called \\"The Poets and Poetry of America\\", the first of which was given in Philadelphia on November 25, 1843. Poe openly attacked Griswold in front of his large audience and continued to do so in similar lectures.Bayless, 75‚Äì76 Graham said that during these lectures, Poe \\"gave Mr. Griswold some raps over the knuckles of force sufficient to be remembered\\".Silverman, 218 In a letter dated January 16, 1845, Poe tried to reconcile with Griswold, promising him that his lecture now omitted all that Griswold found objectionable.Campbell, Killis. \\"The Poe-Griswold Controversy\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 67. Another source of animosity between the two men was their competition for the attention of the poet Frances Sargent Osgood in the mid to late 1840s.Meyers, 209 While both she and Poe were still married to their respective spouses,Meyers, 174 the two carried on a public flirtation that resulted in much gossip among the literati. Griswold, who was smitten with Osgood, escorted her to literary salons and became her staunchest defender. \\"She is in all things the most admirable woman I ever knew\\", he wrote to publisher James T. Fields in 1848.Bayless, 144 Osgood responded by dedicating a collection of her poetry to Griswold, \\"as a souvenir of admiration for his genius, of regard for his generous character, and of gratitude for his valuable literary counsels\\". =\\"Ludwig\\" obituary= After Poe's death, Griswold prepared an obituary signed with the pseudonym \\"Ludwig\\". First printed in the October 9, 1849, issue of the New York Tribune, it was soon republished many times.Sova, 142 Here he asserted that \\"few will be grieved\\" by Poe's death as he had few friends. He claimed that Poe often wandered the streets, either in \\"madness or melancholy\\", mumbling and cursing to himself, was easily irritated, was envious of others, and that he \\"regarded society as composed of villains\\". Poe's drive to succeed, Griswold wrote, was because he sought \\"the right to despise a world which galled his self-conceit\\". Much of this characterization of Poe was copied almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in The Caxtons by Edward Bulwer-Lytton.Moss, 125 Griswold biographer Joy Bayless wrote that Griswold used a pseudonym not to conceal his relationship to the obituary but because it was his custom never to sign his newspaper and his magazine contributions.Bayless, 164 Regardless, Griswold's true identity was soon revealed. In a letter to Sarah Helen Whitman dated December 17, 1849, he admitted his role in writing Poe's death notice. \\"I was not his friend, nor was he mine\\", he wrote.Quinn, 651 =Memoir= Griswold claimed that \\"among the last requests of Mr. Poe\\" was that he become his literary executor \\"for the benefit of his family\\".Bayless, 166‚Äì167 Griswold claimed that Poe's aunt and mother-in-law Maria Clemm said Poe had made such a statement on June 9, 1849, and that she herself released any claim to Poe's works. And indeed a document exists in which Clemm transfers power of attorney to Griswold, dated October 20, 1849, although there are no signed witnesses.Quinn, 754 Clemm, however, had no right to make such a decision; Poe's younger sister Rosalie was his closest next of kin.Silverman, 439 Although Griswold had acted as a literary agent for other American writers, it is unclear if Poe really appointed Griswold his executor (perhaps as part of his \\"Imp of the Perverse\\"Hoffman, Daniel Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972: 14. .), if it were a trick on Griswold's part, or a mistake on Maria Clemm's. It is also possible that Osgood persuaded Poe to name Griswold as his executor. In any case, Griswold, along with James Russell Lowell and Nathaniel Parker Willis, edited a posthumous collection of Poe's works published in three volumes starting in January 1850.Moss, 121 He did not share the profits of his edition with Poe's surviving relatives.Sova, 102 This edition included a biographical sketch titled \\"Memoir of the Author\\" which has become notorious for its inaccuracy. The \\"Memoir\\" depicts Poe as a madman, addicted to drugs and chronically drunk. Many elements were fabricated by Griswold using forged letters as evidence and it was denounced by those who knew Poe, including Sarah Helen Whitman, Charles Frederick Briggs, and George Rex Graham.Sova, 101 In March, Graham published a notice in his magazine accusing Griswold of betraying trust and taking revenge on the dead. \\"Mr. Griswold\\", he wrote, \\"has allowed old prejudices and old enmities to steal ... into the coloring of his picture.\\"Moss, 122 Thomas Holley Chivers wrote a book called New Life of Edgar Allan Poe which directly responded to Griswold's accusations.Beale, 25‚Äì28 He said that Griswold \\"is not only incompetent to Edit any of [Poe's] works, but totally unconscious of the duties which he and every man who sets himself up as a Literary Executor, owe the dead\\".Beale, 70 Today Griswold's name is usually associated with Poe's as a character assassin,Frank, Frederick and Anthony Magistrale. The Poe Encyclopedia. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1991: 149. . although not all believe that Griswold deliberately intended to cause harm. Some of the information that Griswold asserted or implied was that Poe was expelled from the University of Virginia and that Poe had tried to seduce his guardian John Allan's second wife.Silverman, 440 Even so, Griswold's attempts only drew attention to Poe's work; readers were thrilled at the idea of reading the works of an \\"evil\\" man.Meyers, 263 Griswold's characterization of Poe and the false information he originated appeared consistently in Poe biographies for the next two decades.

There is some question of whether what is used for the market portfolio really matters. Some authors say that it does not make a big difference; you can use any representative index and get similar results. Roll gave an example where different indexes produce much different results, and that by choosing the index you can get any ranking you want. Brown and Brown (1987) examine this, using different indexes such as stocks only, stocks and bonds, and stocks plus bonds plus real estate. They find that using a market that includes real estate produces much different results. For example, with one measurement most mutual funds have alpha close to zero, while with another measurement most of them have significantly negative alpha. Most index providers give indices for different components such as stocks only, bonds only, et cetera. As a result, proxies for the market (such as the FTSE 100 in the UK, DAX in Germany or the S&P; 500 in the US) are used in practice by investors. Roll's critique states that these proxies cannot provide an accurate representation of the entire market. The concept of a market portfolio plays an important role in many financial theories and models, including the capital asset pricing model where it is the only fund in which investors need to invest, to be supplemented only by a risk-free asset, depending upon each investor's attitude towards risk. Sharpe (2010) notes that many investors are at least targeted to a fixed ratio (e.g. 60% stocks, 40% bonds). He points out that this is sort of contrarian. The holdings of all investors combined must, by equation, be in the cap-weighted proportions. So many investors following this strategy implies some other investors must follow a buy-high, sell-low (trend following) strategy. He then says that he doesn't like it and people should use adjustments to the market proportions instead. The portfolio of the average investor contains important information for strategic asset allocation purposes. This portfolio shows the relative value of all assets according to the market crowd, which one could interpret as a benchmark for the average investor. Several authors have collected data to determine the composition of the global market portfolio since 1960. The returns on the market portfolio realizes a compounded real return of 4.43% with a standard deviation of 11.2% from 1960 until 2017. In the inflationary period from 1960 to 1979, the compounded real return of the GMP is 3.24%, while this is 6.01% in the disinflationary period from 1980 to 2017. The reward for the average investor is a compounded return of 3.39%-points above the risk-free rate.

It is the most often performed and studied piece in the entire bassoon repertory.Eisen, Cliff: 'Concerto', Grove Music Online ed. L.

Although the autograph score is lost, the exact date of its completion is known: 4 June 1774.Sleeve note of the Supraphon CD (SU 3678-2 001) Mozart wrote the bassoon concerto when he was 18 years old, and it was his first concerto for a wind instrument. ISMN M-006-45809-7 Although it is believed that it was commissioned by an aristocratic amateur bassoon player Thadd√§us Freiherr von D√ºrnitz, who owned seventy-four works by Mozart, this is a claim that is supported by little evidence.Waterhouse, William: 'Bassoon', Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 6 August 2006), Scholars believe that Mozart may have written five bassoon concertos, but that only the first has survived.  Instrumentation  The concerto is scored for a solo bassoon and an orchestra consisting of 2 oboes, 2 horns in Bb (sometimes transcribed for F), violin I/II, viola, and cello and double bass doubling the bass line.  Structure  The piece is divided into three movements: # Allegro # Andante ma Adagio # Rondo: tempo di menuetto The first movement is written in the common sonata form with an orchestral introduction. The second movement is a slow and lyrical sonata without development that contains a theme which was later featured in the Countess's aria \\"Porgi, Amor\\" at the beginning of the second act of Mozart's opera Le nozze di Figaro.

BCFK included Australian, British, Canadian, Indian, and New Zealand units. Some Commonwealth units and personnel served with United States and/or other UN formations, which were not part of BCFK.For example, No. 2 Squadron, South African Air Force was part of the US 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing in Korea, flying P-51s and F-86s. In 1950, Australian units based with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan were among the first UN personnel to be deployed in South Korea. After the administrative support role of BCOF in Japan to the fighting forces in Korea had been decided in November 1950, the title BCFK appeared.Jeffrey Grey, The Commonwealth Armies and the Korean War: An Alliance Study. Manchester University Press ND, 1990, , 9780719027703, p.110 The position of BCFK Commander-in-Chief was always held by Australian Army officers, the first being Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson.

Two Australian Army soldiers enjoy some recreation time at a sandbagged Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI), Korea, 1952 By the time BCFK came into being, the Commonwealth armies had formed the 1st Commonwealth Division (in July 1951) and British and Canadian Army personnel predominated at the operational level in the Commonwealth land forces. Lieutenant General William Bridgeford took over from Robertson in October 1951, and he was later succeeded by Lieutenant General Henry Wells. Wells was succeeded by Lieutenant General Rudolph Bierwirth in 1954. The Royal Navy usually had at least one aircraft carrier on station during the war. Five British carriers: Glory, Ocean, Theseus, Triumph, and (a maintenance and aircraft transport carrier) served in the conflict. The Royal Australian Navy provided the carrier HMAS Sydney. The RN, RAN and Royal Canadian Navy also provided many other warships. The Royal New Zealand Navy deployed a number of Loch class frigates throughout the war. The RN carriers provided the only British fighter planes to take part in the war. On 9 August 1952 a propeller-driven Sea Fury, piloted by Lieutenant Peter Carmichael of No. 802 Squadron, based on HMS Ocean, shot down a MiG-15 jet fighter, becoming one of only a handful of pilots of propeller planes to have shot down a jet. The only front-line unit from a Commonwealth air force to serve under BCFK was Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) No. 77 Squadron, which initially flew P-51 Mustang fighters and later converted to Gloster Meteor jets. British and Canadian aircrews also served with the RAAF. The only Royal Air Force contribution was a wing of Short Sunderland flying boats based at Iwakuni in Japan.

P. Willis,Baker, 3 was an American author, poet and editor who worked with several notable American writers including Edgar Allan Poe and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He became the highest-paid magazine writer of his day. His brother was the composer Richard Storrs Willis and his sister Sara wrote under the name Fanny Fern. Harriet Jacobs wrote her autobiography while being employed as his children's nurse. Born in Portland, Maine, Willis came from a family of publishers. His grandfather Nathaniel Willis owned newspapers in Massachusetts and Virginia, and his father Nathaniel Willis was the founder of Youth's Companion, the first newspaper specifically for children. Willis developed an interest in literature while attending Yale College and began publishing poetry. After graduation, he worked as an overseas correspondent for the New York Mirror. He eventually moved to New York and began to build his literary reputation. Working with multiple publications, he was earning about $100 per article and between $5,000Beers, 262 and $10,000 per year.Baker, 88 In 1846, he started his own publication, the Home Journal, which was eventually renamed Town & Country. Shortly after, Willis moved to a home on the Hudson River where he lived a semi-retired life until his death in 1867. Willis embedded his own personality into his writing and addressed his readers personally, specifically in his travel writings, so that his reputation was built in part because of his character. Critics, including his sister in her novel Ruth Hall, occasionally described him as being effeminate and Europeanized. Willis also published several poems, tales, and a play. Despite his intense popularity for a time, at his death Willis was nearly forgotten. Life and career A young Nathaniel Parker Willis =Early life and family= Nathaniel Parker Willis was born on January 20, 1806, in Portland, Maine.Lapidos, Julet. \\"Old New Haven\\", The Advocate, March 17, 2005. His father Nathaniel Willis was a newspaper proprietor there and his grandfather owned newspapers in Boston, Massachusetts and western Virginia.Auser, 19 His mother was Hannah Willis (n√©e Parker) from Holliston, Massachusetts and it was her husband's offer to edit the Eastern Argus in Maine that caused their move to Portland.Baker, 16 Willis's younger sister was Sara Willis Parton, who would later become a writer under the pseudonym Fanny Fern. His brother, Richard Storrs Willis, became a musician and music journalist known for writing the melody for \\"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\\".Baker, 160 His other siblings were Lucy Douglas (born 1804), Louisa Harris (1807), Julia Dean (1809), Mary Perry (1813), Edward Payson (1816), and Ellen Holmes (1821).Warren, Joyce W. Fanny Fern: An Independent Woman. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1992: 5. In 1816, the family moved to Boston, where Willis's father established the Boston Recorder and, nine years later, the Youth's Companion,Auser, 20 the world's first newspaper for children.Phillips, 909 The elder Willis's emphasis on religious themes earned him the nickname \\"Deacon\\" Willis. After attending a Boston grammar school and Phillips Academy at Andover, Nathaniel Parker Willis entered Yale College in October 1823 where he roomed with Horace Bushnell.Pattee, 500 Willis credited Bushnell with teaching him the proper technique for sharpening a razor by \\"drawing it from heel to point both ways ... the two cross frictions correct each other\\".Lewis, R. W. B. The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1955: 68. At Yale, he further developed an interest in literature, often neglecting his other studies. He graduated in 1827Phillips, 910 and spent time touring parts of the United States and Canada. In Montreal, he met Chester Harding, with whom he would become a lifelong friend. Years later, Harding referred to Willis during this period as \\"the 'lion' of the town\\".Callow, 83 Willis began publishing poetry in his father's Boston Periodical, often using one of two literary personalities under the pen names \\"Roy\\" (for religious subjects) and \\"Cassius\\" (for more secular topics).Auser, 21 The same year, Willis published a volume of poetical Sketches. =Literary career= In the latter part of the 1820s, Willis began contributing more frequently to magazines and periodicals. In 1829, he served as editor for the gift book The Token, making him the only person to be editor in the book's 15-year history besides its founder, Samuel Griswold Goodrich.Vanderbilt, Kermit. American Literature and the Academy: The Roots, Growth, and Maturity of a Profession. Philadelphia: The University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986: 55. That year, Willis founded the American Monthly Magazine, which began publishing in April 1829 until it was discontinued in August 1831. He blamed its failure on the \\"tight purses of Boston culture\\" and moved to Europe to serve as foreign editor and correspondent of the New York Mirror. In 1832, while in Florence, Italy, he met Horatio Greenough, who sculpted a bust of the writer.Callow, 86 Between 1832 and 1836, Willis contributed a series of letters for the Mirror, about half of which were later collected as Pencillings by the Way, printed in London in 1835.Pattee, 515 The romantic descriptions of scenes and modes of life in Europe sold well despite the then high price tag of $7 a copy. The work became popular and boosted Willis's literary reputation enough that an American edition was soon issued.Baker, 84 American Scenery by N. P. Willis with illustration by William Henry Bartlett, 1840. Despite this popularity, he was censured by some critics for indiscretion in reporting private conversations. At one point he fought a bloodless duel with Captain Frederick Marryat, then editor of the Metropolitan Magazine, after Willis sent a private letter of Marryat's to George Pope Morris, who had it printed.Auser, 46 Still, in 1835 Willis was popular enough to introduce Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to important literary figures in England, including Ada Byron, daughter of Lord Byron.Calhoun, Charles C. Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004. . p. 98 While abroad, Willis wrote to a friend, \\"I should like to marry in England\\".Baker, 76 He soon married Mary Stace, daughter of General William Stace of Woolwich, on October 1, 1835, after a month-long engagement.Beers, 170‚Äì171 The couple took a two-week honeymoon in Paris. The couple moved to London where, in 1836, Willis met Charles Dickens, who was working for the Morning Chronicle at the time.Beers, 264 In 1837, Willis and his wife returned to the United StatesPhillips, 911 and settled at a small estate on Owego Creek in New York, just above its junction with the Susquehanna River.Baker, 86 He named the home Glenmary and the rural setting inspired him to write Letters from under a Bridge.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 163. On October 20, 1838, Willis began a series of articles called \\"A New Series of Letters from London\\", one of which suggested an illicit relationship between writer Letitia Elizabeth Landon and editor William Jordan. The article caused some scandal, for which Willis's publisher had to apologize.Auser, 47‚Äì48 On June 20, 1839, Willis's play Tortesa, the Usurer premiered in Philadelphia at the Walnut Street Theatre.Quinn, 284 Edgar Allan Poe called it \\"by far the best play from the pen of an American author\\".Meyers, 152 That year, he was also editor of the short-lived periodical The Corsair, for which he enlisted William Makepeace Thackery to write short sketches of France.Callow, 111 Another major work, Two Ways of Dying for a Husband, was published in England during a short visit there in 1839‚Äì1840. Shortly after returning to the United States, his personal life was touched with grief when his first child was stillborn on December 4, 1840. He and Stace had a second daughter, Imogen, who was born June 20, 1842.Beers, 263‚Äì264 Later that year, Willis attended a ball in honor of Charles Dickens in New York. After dancing with Dickens's wife, Willis and Dickens went out for \\"rum toddy and broiled oysters\\". By this time, his fame had grown enough that he was often invited to lecture and recite poetry, including his presentation to the Linonian Society at Yale on August 17, 1841.Beers, 271 Willis was invited to submit a column to the each weekly issue of Brother Jonathan, a publication from New York with 20,000 subscribers, which he did until September 1841.Beers, 259‚Äì260 By 1842, Willis was earning the unusually high salary of $4,800 a year. As a later journalist remarked, this made Willis \\"the first magazine writer who was tolerably well paid\\".Beers, 260‚Äì261 =Evening Mirror= Willis became the highest-paid magazine writer in America. Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, along with George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening Mirror in 1844 with a weekly supplement called the Weekly Mirror, in part due to the rising cost of postage.Quinn, 434 By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) and one of the first commercially successful magazine writers in America.Silverman, 223 In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold.Bayless, 83 During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary. As a critic, Willis did not believe in including discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides.Auser, 23 The Mirror flourished at a time when many publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors.Auser, 51‚Äì52 Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.Auser, 118 While Willis was editor of the Evening Mirror, its issue for January 29, 1845, included the first printing of Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\" with his name attached. In his introduction, Willis called it \\"unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it\\".Silverman, 237 Willis and Poe were close friends, and Willis helped Poe financially during his wife Virginia's illness and while Poe was suing Thomas Dunn English for libel.Meyers, 202 Willis often tried to persuade Poe to be less destructive in his criticism and concentrate on his poetry.Meyers, 184 Even so, Willis published many pieces of what would later be referred to as \\"The Longfellow War\\", a literary battle between Poe and the supporters of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whom Poe called overrated and guilty of plagiarism.Silverman, 234‚Äì235 Willis also introduced Poe to Fanny Osgood; the two would later carry out a very public literary flirtation.Meyers, 174 Willis's wife Mary Stace died in childbirth on March 25, 1845. Their daughter, Blanche, died as well and Willis wrote in his notebook that she was \\"an angel without fault or foible\\".Beers, 276 He took his surviving daughter Imogen to England to visit her mother's family.Yellin, 83 In October 1846, he married Cornelia Grinnell, a wealthy Quaker from New BedfordBaker, 122 and the adopted daughter of a local Congressman.Beers, 287 She was two decades younger than Willis at the time and vocally disliked slavery, unlike her new husband.Yellin, 109 =Home Journal= In 1846, Willis and Morris left the Evening Mirror and attempted to edit a new weekly, the National Press, which was renamed the Home Journal after eight months.Auser, 125 Their prospectus for the publication, published November 21, 1846, announced their intentions to create a magazine \\"to circle around the family table\\".Auser, 125‚Äì126 Willis intended the magazine for the middle and lower classes and included the message of upward social mobility, using himself as an example, often describing in detail his personal possessions.Tomc, 785‚Äì786 When discussing his own social climbing, however, he emphasized his frustrations rather than his successes, endearing him to his audience.Tomc, 794 He edited the Home Journal until his death in 1867. It was renamed Town & Country in 1901, and it is still published under that title as of 2011. During Willis's time at the journal, he especially promoted the works of women poets, including Frances Sargent Osgood, Anne Lynch Botta, Grace Greenwood, and Julia Ward Howe.Auser, 130 Willis and his editors favorably reviewed many works now considered important today, including Henry David Thoreau's Walden and Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance.Auser, 132 =Idlewild= Willis purchased a home in 1846 which he named Idlewild. The home would later inspire the title of an 1855 book. In 1846, Willis settled near the banks of Canterbury Creek near the Hudson River in New York and named his new home Idlewild.Auser, 142The first floor of the former three-story brick home is still standing in an area known as Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York at 20 Idlewild Park Drive; it is a private home. See: Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 106. When Willis first visited the property, the owners said it had little value and that it was \\"an idle wild of which nothing could ever be made\\".Beers, 328 He built a fourteen-room \\"cottage\\", as he called it, at the edge of a plateau by Moodna Creek next to a sudden drop into a gorge. Willis worked closely with the architect, Calvert Vaux, to carefully plan each gable and piazza to fully take advantage of the dramatic view of the river and mountains.Yellin, 126 Because of failing health Willis spent the remainder of his life chiefly in retirement at Idlewild. His wife Cornelia was also recovering from a difficult illness after the birth of their first child together, a son named Grinnell, who was born April 28, 1848. They had four other children: Lilian (born April 27, 1850),Beers, 294 Edith (born September 28, 1853), Bailey (born May 31, 1857), and a daughter who died only a few minutes after her birth on October 31, 1860.Beers, 329 In 1850, Cornelia Willis re-hired Harriet Jacobs, a fugitive slave from North Carolina, who had already before been working for the family as Imogen's nanny.Yellin, 70, 83 When her legal owners came to New York in 1852 to force her back into slavery, Cornelia Willis bought her freedom for $300.Yellin, 114-116 While working for the Willis family at Idlewild, Jacobs wrote her autobiography, published in 1861. Her biographer, J.F.Yellin, comments on the irony of the situation: \\"Idlewild had been conceived as a famous writer's retreat, but its owner never imagined that it was his children's nurse who would create an American classic there\\".Yellin, 126 Jacobs stayed with the Willis family until after the publication of her book.Yellin, 150 Cornelia Willis is called a \\"true ... friend\\"Jacobs, Harriet A., Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Harvard University Press, 2000: 190. Jacobs changes all names in her book, Willis becomes \\"Bruce\\". in the autobiography, and the friendship lasted into the next generation, ending only with the death of Louisa Jacobs at the home of Edith Willis Grinnell in 1917.Yellin, 70, 265 During these last years at Idlewild, Willis continued contributing a weekly letter to the Home Journal. In 1850 he assisted Rufus Wilmot Griswold in preparing an anthology of the works of Poe, who had died mysteriously the year before. Griswold also wrote the first biography of Poe in which he purposely set out to ruin the dead author's reputation. Willis was one of the most vocal of Poe's defenders, writing at one point: \\"The indictment (for it deserves no other name) is not true. It is full of cruel misrepresentations. It deepens the shadows unto unnatural darkness, and shuts out the rays of sunshines that ought to relieve them\\".Quinn, 666‚Äì667 Willis was involved in the 1850 divorce suit between the actor Edwin Forrest and his wife Catherine Norton Sinclair Forrest. In January 1849, Forrest had found a love letter to his wife from fellow actor George W. Jamieson.Baker, 116 As a result, he and Catherine separated in April 1849. He moved to Philadelphia and filed for divorce in February 1850 though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his application.Beers, 309 Catharine went to live with the family of Parke Godwin and the separation became a public affair, with newspapers throughout New York reporting on supposed infidelities and other gossip.Baker, 117 Willis defended Catharine, who maintained her innocence, in the Home Journal and suggested that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority.Beers, 311 On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court,Beers, 312 Forrest beat Willis with a gutta-percha whip in New York's Washington Square, shouting \\"this man is the seducer of my wife\\".Baker, 115 Willis, who was recovering from a rheumatic fever at the time, was unable to fight back.Beers, 313 His wife soon received an anonymous letter with an accusation that Willis was in an adulterous relationship with Catherine Forrest.Yellin, 112 Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed he had seen the couple \\"lying on each other\\". As the press reported, \\"thousands and thousands of the anxious public\\" awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.Yellin, 113 =Ruth Hall= Willis arbitrarily refused to print the work of his sister Sara Willis (\\"Fanny Fern\\") after 1854, though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the Home Journal. She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband.Yellin, 132 Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem \\"To My Wild Sis\\".Baker, 161 As Fanny Fern, she had published Fern Leaves, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before.Baker, 164 Willis, however, did not encourage his sister's writings. \\"You overstrain the pathetic, and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimes ... I am sorry that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which you sent me\\", he wrote.Baker, 163 In 1854 she published Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time,Auser, 334 a barely concealed semi-autobiographical account of her own difficulties in the literary world. Nathaniel Willis was represented as \\"Hyacinth Ellet\\", an effeminate, self-serving editor who schemes to ruin his sister's prospects as a writer.Baker, 170 Willis did not publicly protest but in private he asserted that, despite his fictitious equivalent, he had done his best to support his sister during her difficult times, especially after the death of her first husband.Auser, 336‚Äì337 Among his later works, following in his traditional sketches about his life and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later.Auser, 101 The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may have been based on painter Chester Harding.Callow, 84 His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.Beers, 332‚Äì333 =Final years and death= Grave of Nathaniel Parker Willis In July 1860, Willis took his last major trip. Along with his wife, he stopped in Chicago and Yellow Springs, Ohio, as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, and also took a steamboat down the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, and returned through Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Beers, 340‚Äì341 In 1861, Willis allowed the Home Journal to break its pledge to avoid taking sides in political discussions when the Confederate States of America was established, calling the move a purposeful act to bring on war.Auser, 128 On May 28, 1861, Willis was part of a committee of literary figures‚Äîincluding William Cullen Bryant, Charles Anderson Dana, and Horace Greeley‚Äîto invite Edward Everett to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union.Auser, 128‚Äì129 The Home Journal lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.Baker, 188 Willis was very sick in these final years: he suffered from violent epileptic seizures and, early in November 1866, fainted in the streets.Yellin, 201 Willis died on his 61st birthday, January 20, 1867, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Beers, 350 Four days later, the day of his funeral, all bookstores in the city were closed as a token of respect. His pallbearers included Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Samuel Gridley Howe, and James Thomas Fields.Baker, 187 Reputation Daguerreotype of Willis, circa 1857 Throughout his literary career, Willis was well liked and known for his good nature amongst friends. Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of \\"Miss Nancyism\\". One editor called him \\"an impersonal passive verb‚Äîa pronoun of the feminine gender\\". A contemporary caricature depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis's wide reputation as a \\"dandy\\".Reilly, John E. \\"Poe in Pillory: An Early Version of a Satire by A. J. H. Duganne\\", Poe Studies, vol. VI, no. 1, June 1973: 10. Accessed June 5, 2008 Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself as a member of an upcoming American aristocracy.Baker, 97 As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once said, Willis was \\"something between a remembrance of Count D'Orsay and an anticipation of Oscar Wilde\\".Tomc, 783 Publisher Charles Frederick Briggs once wrote that \\"Willis was too Willisy\\".Thomas, Dwight and David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809‚Äì1849. New York: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 514. He described his writings as the \\"novelty and gossip of the hour\\" and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the \\"material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth\\".Baker, 87 Willis's behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. \\"He is too artificial\\", Longfellow wrote to his friend George Washington Greene. \\"And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me‚Äîits sincerity\\".Thompson, Lawrance. Young Longfellow (1807‚Äì1843). New York: The Macmillan Company,1938: 215. E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in Pittsburgh, wrote that \\"Willis is a kind of national pet and we must regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled stripling, in the hope that he will amend\\".Thomas, Dwight and David K. Jackson. The Poe Log: A Documentary Life of Edgar Allan Poe 1809‚Äì1849. New York: G. K. Hall & Co., 1987: 266. Willis built up his reputation in the public at a time when readers were interested in the personal lives of writers.Baker, 6 In his writings, he described the \\"high life\\" of the \\"Upper Ten Thousand\\", a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reasonAuser, 54 as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers.Tomc, 786 Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as Pencillings by the Way and Dashes at Life With Free Pencil, which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing.Callow, 113 He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: \\"We would have you ... indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in your private ear and over our iced Margaux\\".Tomc, 784 When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.Watts, Emily Stipes. The Poetry of American Women from 1632 to 1945. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 1978: 73‚Äì74. In the publishing world, Willis was known as a shrewd magazinist and an innovator who focused on appealing to readers' special interests while still recognizing new talent.Auser, 146 In fact, Willis became the standard by which other magazinists were judged. According to writer George William Curtis, \\"His gayety [sic] and his graceful fluency made him the first of our proper 'magazinists'\\".Pattee, 499 For a time, it was said that Willis was the \\"most-talked-about author\\" in the United States.Baker, 4 Poe questioned Willis's fame, however. \\"Willis is no genius‚Äìa graceful trifler‚Äìno more\\", he wrote in a letter to James Russell Lowell. \\"In me, at least, he never excites an emotion.\\"Quinn, 389 Minor Southern writer Joseph Beckham Cobb wrote: \\"No sane person, we are persuaded, can read his poetry\\".Hubbell, Jay B. The South in American Literature: 1607‚Äì1900. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1954: 638. Future senator Charles Sumner reported: \\"I find Willis is much laughed at for his sketches\\".Baker, 100 Even so, most contemporaries recognized how prolific he was as a writer and how much time he put into all of his writings. James Parton said of him: By 1850 and with the publication of Hurry-Graphs, Willis was becoming a forgotten celebrity. In August 1853, future President James A. Garfield discussed Willis's declining popularity in his diary: \\"Willis is said to be a licentious man, although an unrivaled poet. How strange that such men should go to ruin, when they might soar perpetually in the heaven of heavens\\".Baker, 158 After Willis's death, obituaries reported that he had outlived his fame.Beers, 351 One remarked, \\"the man who withdraws from the whirling currents of active life is speedily forgotten\\". This obituary also stated that Americans \\"will ever remember and cherish Nathaniel P. Willis as one worthy to stand with Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving\\".\\"Obituary. Nathaniel Parker Willis\\", The New York Times. January 22, 1867. Accessed May 11, 2008 In 1946, the centennial issue of Town & Country reported that Willis \\"led a generation of Americans through a gate where weeds gave way to horticulture\\". More modern scholars have dismissed Willis's work as \\"sentimental prattle\\" or refer to him only as an obstacle in the progress of his sister as well as Harriet Jacobs.Tomc, 799‚Äì800 As biographer Thomas N. Baker wrote, Willis is today only referred to as a footnote in relation to other authors.

Early life Ted Chapman was born in Pontlottyn, near Rhymney, the son of a coal miner. He left school at age 14 and like many of his generation followed his father underground at the Ogilvie Colliery. He enlisted in the British Army in April 1940, during the Second World War, joining the Monmouthshire Regiment and seeing action from his battalion's landing shortly after the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944 through the advance into North-west Europe. He was wounded at Falaise in the breakout from the Normandy bridgehead. Details Chapman was 25 years old, and a corporal in the 3rd Battalion, Monmouthshire Regiment, British Army during the Second World War when the following action took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 2 April 1945, near the Dortmund-Ems canal, Germany, Corporal Chapman's section came under heavy machine-gun fire from German units dug in and concealed, causing many casualties. He ordered his men to take cover and went forward alone with a Bren gun, mowing down the enemy at point-blank range, forcing them to retire. His section isolated, Corporal Chapman again halted the enemy advances with his Bren gun, at one time firing it over his shoulder while lying supine on his back in a shallow fold in the ground, to cover those bringing him ammunition. He then carried in his Company Commander, an officer, who was lying wounded, but on the way back the officer was killed by further German fire and Corporal Chapman wounded in the thigh. Refusing hospitalisation he returned to his section and ensured the consolidation of the ground gained which took a further two hours of fighting.

Early life Chowne was born in Sydney. He attended Chatswood Boys Intermediate High School and Naremburn Junior Technical School. In 1935, he began work as a shirt-cutter with David Jones. In his spare time Chowne played rugby union and tennis, and took part in Scouting. Second World War Chowne spent a brief period in the 36th Battalion, a Militia unit, before enlisting in the Second Australian Imperial Force in late May 1940. He was assigned to the 2/13th Battalion as a platoon message runner, and was later made company runner. The unit, part of the 9th Division, arrived in the Middle East in November 1940 and later joined the North African campaign, defending Tobruk for eight months in 1941. During his time at Tobruk, Chowne transferred to the carrier platoon and was promoted to corporal. After Tobruk the 2/13th performed garrison duties in Syria where, in September, Chowne was promoted to sergeant. He was wounded in the leg and hand at El Alamein the following month and spent three weeks in hospital. He returned to Australia with the battalion in January 1943. In July, the unit was deployed to New Guinea campaign, taking part in the Battle of Finschhafen. Chowne, now commanding a mortar platoon, was awarded the Military Medal for twice crawling close to enemy positions to direct mortar fire. Regarded as exceptionally cool by his comrades, Chowne combined fearlessness with a self- effacing manner. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1944 and he married Daphne Barton, a corporal in the Australian Women's Army Service, in March that year. After completing a jungle warfare training course at Canungra, Queensland, Lt. Chowne was posted to the 2/2nd Battalion, part of the 6th Division, in October 1944. Two months later the 2/2nd began the Aitape-Wewak campaign in New Guinea in November 1944. =Victoria Cross action= On 25 March 1945 near Dagua Airfield, Chowne attacked an enemy position which was holding up further movement towards Wewak.Odgers 1988, p. 179. Seeing that the leading platoon was suffering heavy casualties, Chowne rushed forward and knocked out two light machine guns with grenades and then, calling on his men to follow him and firing his sub machine gun from the hip, he charged the position. Although he was twice wounded in the chest, the impetus of his charge carried him forward 50 yards under intense machine gun and rifle fire and he accounted for two more of the enemy before he was killed. The grave of Albert Chowne VC at Lae War Cemetery, Papua New Guinea. Chowne was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously and was buried at the Lae War Cemetery, Lae, New Guinea. His VC is displayed at the Australian War Memorial. Legacy Chowne's name is commemorated in several places around Australia. A street in Campbell, Canberra is named. In Willoughby, Sydney, the community facility is called the Albert Chowne Memorial Hall and Chowne Place, both named after him. On 8 May 2015, Chowne's widow, Daphne Dunne, was in the crowd at the Sydney Opera House when Prince Harry was farewelled from Australia by the public at the end of a month-long deployment with the Australian Army. The prince recognised the VC medal in the cluster worn on Dunne's right breast, and approached her to discuss the medal as well as her own medals over her left breast. The Daily Telegraph reported that Dunne had a conversation with the prince and \\"she told him how her first husband Lieutenant Albert Chowne died aged 25 in 1945 ‚Äì just a year after they married ‚Äì in a heroic attack on a Japanese machinegun post in Papua New Guinea. The red roses that Lt Chowne had arranged to be sent to his young bride on her birthday arrived just before the news he had been killed.\\" It went on to say: \\"She wed her second husband, Corporal John Dunne, who was captured in Malaya in 1942 and ended up in Changi POW camp ... (regarding the prince) In a show of affection as he leaned down towards her, she touched his face before he kissed her on the cheek.\\" The newspaper also reported that, in meeting the prince, she had now met all the senior members of the British royal family.Prince Harry Sydney visit to include meeting the public at Opera House, Miles Godfrey, Sarah Crawford and Janet Fife-Yeomans, The Daily Telegraph (Sydney), 8 May 2015 Dunne died on 1 April 2019, shortly after receiving a birthday card from Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, to celebrate her 99th birthday.

He was born in Karachi, British India of Scottish parentage and attended Karachi Grammar School. Cumming was 45 years old, and a lieutenant colonel commanding the 2/12th Frontier Force Regiment, in the Indian Army during World War II. Lt. Col Cumming and his battalion were defending an airfield during the Battle of Malaya when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC (currently displayed at the National Army Museum). On 3 January 1942 near Kuantan, Malaya, the Japanese made a furious attack on the battalion and a strong enemy force penetrated the position. Lieutenant Colonel Cumming, with a small party of men, immediately led a counter-attack and although all his men became casualties and he, himself, had two bayonet wounds in the stomach he managed to restore the situation sufficiently for the major portion of the battalion and its vehicles to be withdrawn. Later he drove in a carrier, under very heavy fire, collecting isolated detachments of his men and was again wounded. His gallant actions helped the brigade to withdraw safely. Cumming was one of a small number of officers and men who were ordered to be evacuated from Singapore before the island was surrendered on 15 February 1942. Cumming commanded a battalion of the 9th Jat Regiment before his promotion to brigadier and command of the 63rd Indian Brigade during the Burma Campaign. From 1944 to his retirement in 1947 Brigadier Cumming was in command of the Dehra Dun District in India. His VC is on display at the National Army Museum, Chelsea.

Life Daykins was born in Hawick in 1883 to John and Bessie Daykins, but he moved with his family to Jedburgh when he was a child. In 1914 he enlisted with the Lothians and Border Horse and he was at Loos, the Battle of Vimy Ridge and the battle of Ypres. After this he was discharged after suffering from Trench fever. He refused to be labelled as \\"unfit\\" and on the third attempt he successfully re-enlisted again in the York and Lancaster Regiment and served in Battle of Passchendaele and again on Vimy Ridge. He was in the 2/4th Battalion at Solesmes, Nord in France on 30 October 1918 with a dozen of his platoon. John Daykins VC welcomed at Jedburgh Town Hall They rushed a machine-gun and during subsequent severe hand-to-hand fighting Daykins disposed of many of the enemy and secured his objective. He then located another machine-gun which was holding up an operation of his company. Under heavy fire he worked his way alone to the post and shortly afterwards returned with 25 prisoners and an enemy machine-gun, which he mounted at his post. His magnificent fighting spirit and example inspired his men, saved many casualties and contributed largely to the success of the attack. When he returned to Jedburgh he was made a burgess. In 1924 he inherited his family's Howden farm when his father died.

Soon after her marriage to Richard Henry Stoddard, the author, she began to publish poems in all the leading magazines, and thereafter, she was a frequent contributor. Her verses were of a high order; she wrote for intellectual readers only. She never collected the numerous poems she published in the periodicals, although there were enough of them to fill a large volume. In addition to her poetical productions, she published three novels: The Morgesons (New York City, 1862); Two Men (1865), and Temple House (1867). Those books did not find a large sale when first published, but a second edition, published in 1888, found a wider circle of readers. They were pictures of New England scenes and characters. In 1874, she published Lolly Dinks's Doings, a juvenile story. Early life and education Elizabeth Drew Barstow was born May 6, 1823, in the small coastal town of Mattapoisett, Massachusetts. She received a thorough education in various boarding-schools and in her school-days showed her bent towards poetry and literature in general. She studied at Wheaton Seminary, Norton, Massachusetts. Career After her marriage in 1852 to poet Richard Henry Stoddard, the couple settled permanently in New York City, where they belonged to New York's vibrant, close-knit literary and artistic circles. She assisted her husband in his literary work, and contributed stories, poems and essays to the periodicals. Many of her own works were originally published between 1859 and 1890 in such magazines as The Aldine, Harper's Monthly, Harper's Bazaar, and The Atlantic Monthly. Stoddard is most widely known today as the author of The Morgesons (1862), her first of three novels. Her other two novels are Two Men (1865) and Temple House (1867). Stoddard was also a prolific writer of short stories, children's tales, poems, essays, travel writing, and journalism pieces. Her work combines the narrative style of the popular nineteenth- century male-centered bildungsroman with the conventions of women's romantic fiction in this revolutionary exploration of the conflict between a woman's instinct, passion, and will, and the social taboos, family allegiances, and traditional New England restraint that inhibit her. Her most studied work, The Morgesons is set in a small seaport town, and is the dramatic story of Cassandra Morgeson's fight against social and religious norms in a quest for sexual, spiritual, and economic autonomy. An indomitable heroine, Cassandra not only achieves an equal and complete love with her husband and ownership of her family's property, but also masters the skills and accomplishments expected of women. Counterpointed with the stultified lives of her aunt, mother, and sister, Cassandra's success is a striking and radical affirmation of women's power to shape their own destinies. Embodying the convergence of the melodrama and sexual undercurrents of gothic romance and Victorian social realism, The Morgesons marks an important transition in the development of the novel and evoked comparisons during Stoddard's lifetime with such masters as Honor√© de Balzac, Leo Tolstoy, George Eliot, the Bront√´ sisters, and Nathaniel Hawthorne.Habegger, Alfred (1989). Henry James and the \\"Woman Business\\", p. 95. Cambridge University Press. One major source of Stoddard's importance to American literature is the historicism of her work, the manner in which her writing embodied and subverted the tension of her present-day culture with the archetypal or received values of the American past. A pioneering predecessor of regionalist authors Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Kate Chopin, as well as a precursor of American modernism, Stoddard's writing is remarkable for its almost total lack of sentimentality, pervasive use of irony, psychological depth of richly drawn characters, intense atmospheric descriptions of New England, concise language, and innovative use of narrative voice and structure. Her investigation of relations between the sexes, a dominant focus of her fiction, analyzes emotions ranging from love and desire to disdain, aggression, and depression.

Gheorghe I. TƒÉtƒÉrescu (also known as Gu»õƒÉ TƒÉtƒÉrescu, with a slightly antiquated pet form of his given name; 2 November 1886 ‚Äì 28 March 1957) was a Romanian politician who served twice as Prime Minister of Romania (1934‚Äì1937; 1939‚Äì1940), three times as Minister of Foreign Affairs (interim in 1934 and 1938; appointed to the office in 1945-1947), and once as Minister of War (1934). Representing the \\"young liberals\\" faction inside the National Liberal Party (PNL), TƒÉtƒÉrescu began his political career as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca, becoming noted for his anti-Communism and, in time, for his conflicts with the PNL's leader Dinu BrƒÉtianu and the Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu. During his first time in office, he moved closer to King Carol II, leading an ambivalent policy toward the fascist Iron Guard and ultimately becoming instrumental in establishing the authoritarian and corporatist regime around the National Renaissance Front. In 1940, he accepted the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and consequently had to resign. After the start of World War II, Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu initiated a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party- TƒÉtƒÉrescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, he was also the President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between TƒÉtƒÉrescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu. He died soon after his release from prison. Elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1937, he was removed from his seat by the Communist authorities in 1948.Gogan One of his brothers, Colonel »òtefan TƒÉtƒÉrescu, was at some point the leader of a minor Nazi group, the National Socialist Party. Early life and politics Born in T√¢rgu Jiu, TƒÉtƒÉrescu studied at Carol I High School in Craiova. He later went to France, where he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1912, with a thesis on the Romanian parliamentary system (Le r√©gime √©lectoral et parlementaire en Roumanie). He subsequently worked as a lawyer in Bucharest. He fathered a son, Tudor, and a daughter, Sanda (married to the lawyer Ulise Negropontes in 1940).Petru After joining the National Liberal Party (PNL), he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919, representing Gorj County.Constantinescu, p.21 Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to interpellate Nicolae L. Lupu, the Minister of Interior Affairs Ministry in the Romanian National Party-Peasants' Party cabinet, in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating socialist agitation in the countryside.Constantinescu, p.24-25 He stood among the PNL's \\"young liberals\\" faction (as they were colloquially known), supporting free trade and a more authoritarian rule over the country around King Carol II, and opposing both the older generation of leaders (who tended to advocate protectionism and a liberal democracy) and the dissident group of Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu (see National Liberal Party-BrƒÉtianu).Hitchins, p.380, 385, 412; Ornea, p.16; Scurtu, \\"Politica...\\", p.16-17; Veiga, p.212 Undersecretary in the Interior Affairs Ministry under several PNL cabinets (beginning with that of Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu in 1922‚Äì1926), he first became noted as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca. In 1924‚Äì1936, in contrast to his post-World War II agenda, TƒÉtƒÉrescu was a noted anti-communist, and reacted vehemently against the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR, later PCR)Cioroianu, p.36, 111‚Äîrecommending and obtaining its outlawing, based on Communist adversity to the concept of Greater Romania, and notably arguing that the Comintern-supported Tatarbunary Uprising was evidence of \\"imperialist communism\\".TƒÉtƒÉrescu, 1926 speech First cabinet =Context= TƒÉtƒÉrescu became leader of the cabinet in January 1934, as the fascist Iron Guard had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on 30 December 1933 (the five-day premiership of Constantin Anghelescu ensured transition between the two governments). His was the second PNL cabinet formed during Carol's reign, and the latter's failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a tight connection being established between Carol and the young liberals, with TƒÉtƒÉrescu backing the process leading to the creation of a royal dictatorship.Hitchins, p.412; Scurtu, \\"Politica...\\", p.16 One of TƒÉtƒÉrescu's first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the Mayor of Bucharest, Dem I. Dobrescu (who was backed by the National Peasants' Party)‚Äîmaking use of his prerogative, he removed Dobrescu from office on 18 January.ZƒÉnescu et al., p.83 The brief period constituted a reference point in Romanian economy, as the emergence from the Great Depression, although marked by endemic problems, saw prosperity more widespread than ever before.Veiga, p.211 This was, in part, the contribution of new economic relations which TƒÉtƒÉrescu defended and encouraged: the state transformed itself into the main agent of economic activities, allowing for prosperous businesses to benefit from its demands, and, in time, leading to the creation of a camarilla dominated by the figures of industrialists such as Aristide Blank, Nicolae Malaxa, and Max Auschnitt.Gallagher, p.102-103; Veiga, p.212-213 In this context, TƒÉtƒÉrescu's allegedly subservient position in front of Carol was a frequent topic of ridicule at the time.Gallagher, p.102; Pandrea According to a hostile account of the socialist Petre Pandrea: > \\"TƒÉtƒÉrescu was ceremonious in order to cover his menial nature. When he was > leaving audiences [with the King], he pressed forward on the small of his > back and returned facing backwards from the desk to the door, not daring to > show his back. [...] Watching over the scene [...], Carol II exclaimed to > his intimate assistants: > ‚Äî I don't have a big enough tooshie for all the politicians to kiss!\\"Pandrea > (Pandrea's italics) Among other services rendered, he intervened in the conflict between Carol and his brother, Prince Nicholas, asking the latter to renounce either his marriage to Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti‚Äîconsidered a misalliance by Carol, it had not been recognized by Romanian authorities‚Äîor his princely prerogatives.Scurtu, \\"Principele Nicolae...\\" Nicholas chose the latter alternative in 1937. Inside his party, TƒÉtƒÉrescu lost ground to Dinu BrƒÉtianu, elected by the traditional Liberal elite as a compromise in order to ensure unity; upon his election in 1934, the latter stated: > \\"This time as well, I would have gladly conceded, if I were to believe that > anyone else in the party could gather voter unanimity.\\"BrƒÉtianu, in Scurtu, > \\"Politica...\\", p.17 The issue remained debated for the following two years. The party congress of July 1936 eventually elected TƒÉtƒÉrescu to the second position in the party, that of general secretary.Scurtu, \\"Politica...\\", p.17 =European politics= In his foreign policy, Prime Minister TƒÉtƒÉrescu balanced two different priorities, attempting to strengthen the traditional military alliance with Poland which was aimed at the Soviet Union, and reacting against the growing regional influence of Nazi Germany by maintaining the relevancy of the Little Entente and establishing further contacts with the Soviets. In August 1936, he removed Nicolae Titulescu from the office of Foreign Minister, replacing him with Victor Antonescu. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania's diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, virtually all of Titulescu's supporters were themselves recalled (including, among others, Constantin Vi»ôoianu, the ambassador to Poland, Constantin Antoniade, Romania's representative to the League of Nations, Dimitrie Ghyka, the ambassador to Belgium, and Caius Brediceanu, the ambassador to Austria) while Titulescu's adversaries, such as Antoine Bibesco, were returned to office.Potra, Part I, Part II Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to reassure Romania's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania's priorities.Potra, Part II TƒÉtƒÉrescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.»öurlea, p.29 In early 1937, TƒÉtƒÉrescu rejected the proposal of J√≥zef Beck, Poland's Minister of Foreign Affairs, to withdraw Romania's support for Czechoslovakia and attempt a reconciliation with Hungary (the following year, Romania withdrew its support for the former, indicating, just before the Munich Agreement, that it was not in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia's frontiers).Hitchins, p.432-433 This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets: a scandal erupted in the same year, when the country's ambassador to Romania, Jan ≈†eba, published a volume calling for Soviet-Entente military cooperation (despite the Soviet-Romanian conflict over Bessarabia) and expressing the hope that the Soviet state would extend its borders into West Belarus and Ukraine.Otu Kamil Krofta, Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister, received criticism for having prefaced the book, and, after TƒÉtƒÉrescu paid a visit to Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan Hod≈æa, ≈†eba was recalled to Prague. =Facing the Iron Guard= In combating the Iron Guard, TƒÉtƒÉrescu chose to relax virtually all pressures on the latter (while mimicking some of its messages), and instead concentrated again on curbing the activities of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) and outlawing its Popular Front-type organizations (see Amicii URSS).Cioroianu, p.43, 113-118; FrunzƒÉ, p.84, 102-103; Veiga, p.223-224 In April 1936, he and the Minister of the Interior Ion Incule»õ allowed the a youth congress to gather in T√¢rgu Mure»ô, aware of the fact that it was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca's memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in T√¢rgu Mure»ô, made public their violent anti-Semitic agenda.Ornea, p.304-305; Veiga, p.233 It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading to the murder of Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.Ornea, p.305, 307 In February 1937, an intense publicity campaign by the Guard, begun with the ostentatious funerals of Ion Mo»õa and Vasile Marin (killed in the Spanish Civil War) and culminating in the physical assaulting of Traian Bratu, rector of the University of Ia»ôi, by Guardist students, provoked the premier's order to close down universities throughout the country.Veiga, p.234 Later in that year, the collaboration between monarch and premier, coupled with the fact that TƒÉtƒÉrescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-BrƒÉtianu‚Äîthe pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections.Hitchins, p.412-413; Ornea, p.302-303, 304; Veiga, p.234-235; Zamfirescu, p.11 (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.)Veiga, p.235 TƒÉtƒÉrescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party. The 1937 elections led to an unprecedented situation: although the PNL and TƒÉtƒÉrescu had gained the largest percentage of the vote (almost 36%), they fell short of being awarded majority bonus (granted at 40% of the vote).Hitchins, p.413 As the far right had gathered momentum (the Guard, running under the name of \\"Everything for the Fatherland Party\\", had obtained 15.6% of the vote),Hitchins, p.413; Zamfirescu, p.11 Carol was faced with the threat of an Iron Guard government, which would have been one deeply opposed to all of his political principles: he called on a third party, Octavian Goga's National Christian Party (coming from the anti-Semitic far right but deeply opposed to the Guard) to form a new cabinet in December of that year.Hitchins, p.414 Consequently, TƒÉtƒÉrescu renounced his offices inside the party, and, while keeping his office of general secretary, he was surpassed by the readmitted Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu ‚Äî who was elected to the new office of PNL vice president on 10 January 1938. After the failure of Goga's policies to curb the rise of their competitors, the king, backed by TƒÉtƒÉrescu, resorted to dissolving all political parties on 30 May 1938, creating instead the National Renaissance Front.Hitchins, p.415, 417-418; Pope Brewer =Rearmament= As Prime Minister, TƒÉtƒÉrescu showed particular concern for the modernization of the Romanian Armed Forces. Almost immediately after becoming Prime Minister, he established the Ministry of Armaments, chaired by himself. This ministry lasted for over three years before being dissolved on 23 February 1937, during his third cabinet. Under TƒÉtƒÉrƒÉscu's premiership, Romania launched a ten-year rearmament program on 27 April 1935. Under this program, Romania acquired 248 ≈†koda 100 mm howitzers (delivered in the mid-1930s) and 180 ≈†koda 150 mm howitzers (delivered between 1936 and 1939). In 1936, Romania ordered 126 LT vz 35 tanks and 35 AH-IV tankettes. These acquisitions from Czechoslovakia were followed in 1937 by 12 Focke-Wulf Fw 58 aircraft, ordered from Germany and delivered between April and June that same year. Romania employed German technicians to build a shipyard at Gala»õi using materials supplied by the Re»ôi»õa works. There, two submarines would be built between 1938 and 1943, among others (Marsuinul and Rechinul).Jonathan A. Grant, Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp. 187-188 The resumed and much improved trade relations with ≈†koda, following the disastrous \\"≈†koda Affair\\" of the early 1930s, were credited to the energy and ability of TƒÉtƒÉrƒÉscu, \\"the soldier-politician who reversed the usual order in Romanian politics by placing the welfare of the country superior to the lust for graft\\".Jonathan A. Grant, Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp. 107-108 It is worth noting, however, that of the 35 tankettes and 126 tanks ordered during TƒÉtƒÉrescu's premiership, only 10 of the former and 15 of the latter actually arrived in Romania before the end of his mandate at the end of 1937. Both of these orders were delivered in full during late 1938 and early 1939, respectively.Kliment, Charles K.; Francev, Vladim√≠r (1997), Czechoslovak Armored Fighting Vehicles, Atglen, PA: Schiffer, pp. 113-114 and 124-126 In 1936, Romania also started producing the Polish PZL P.11 fighter aircraft, of which 95 were ultimately built by IAR.Morga≈Ça, Andrzej (1997), Samoloty wojskowe w Polsce 1918-1924 [Military aircraft in Poland 1918-1924] (in Polish), Warsaw: Lampart, pp. 63 and 69 In 1937, Romanian production of the improved PZL P.24 also commenced, with 25 fighters being built until 1939.Bern√°d, D√©nes, Rumanian Air Force: The Prime Decade 1938-1947, Carrollton, TX: Squadron/Signal Publications Inc, 1999, p. 45 Second cabinet In this context, TƒÉtƒÉrescu chose to back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, remained active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning it had never been enforced any further).Hitchins, p.416; Veiga, p.247-248 Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years.Scurtu, \\"Politica...\\", p.18 Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu BrƒÉtianu's political allies. Soon after his second arrival to power, TƒÉtƒÉrescu became noted for the enthusiastic support he gave to the modernist sculptor Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, and directed state funds to finance the building of Br√¢ncu»ôi's The Endless Column complex in T√¢rgu Jiu (completed in October 1938). Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom he succeeded as Premier), TƒÉtƒÉrescu became a dominant figure in the group of maverick pro-Carol politicians.Argetoianu After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, TƒÉtƒÉrescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war.Pope Brewer TƒÉtƒÉrescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties,Hitchins, p.418 and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest UrdƒÉreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.Hitchins, p.419; Ornea, p.323-325; Zamfirescu, p.11 TƒÉtƒÉrescu remained in office throughout the rest of the Phony War, until the fall of France, and his cabinet signed an economic agreement with Nazi Germany (through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country)Veiga, p.267 and saw the crumbling of Romania's alliance with the United Kingdom and France.Veiga, p.267-268 The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (effects of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact), as well as by Carol's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing TƒÉtƒÉrescu with Ion Gigurtu, and recreating the Front as the totalitarian Party of the Nation.Argetoianu; Hitchins, p.419 World War Greater Romania with Northern Transylvania highlighted in yellow After the Second Vienna Award (when Northern Transylvania was lost to Hungary), confirming Carol's failure to preserve both the country's neutrality and its territorial integrity, Romania was taken over by an Iron Guard dictatorial government (the National Legionary State). Speaking five years later, Dinu BrƒÉtianu placed the blame for the serious developments on TƒÉtƒÉrescu's own actions, addressing him directly: > \\"I remind you: [...] you have contributed directly, in 1940, in steering the > country towards a foreign policy that, as one could tell even then, was to > prove ill-fated and which led us to the loathsome Vienna settlement, one > which you have supported inside the Crown Council [...].\\"BrƒÉtianu, in > »öurlea, p.29 On 26 November 1940, the Iron Guard began a bloody retaliation against various political figures who had served under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the movement's founder and early leader, by Carol's authorities). TƒÉtƒÉrescu and Constantin Argetoianu were among the second wave of captured politicians (on 27 November), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of regular police forces, most of whom had grown hostile to the Guardist militias.Veiga, p.292, 309 Retired from political life during the war, he was initially sympathetic to Ion Antonescu's pro-German dictatorship (see Romania during World War II)‚ÄîDinu BrƒÉtianu, who remained in opposition to the Antonescu regime, made mention an official visit to Bessarabia, recovered after the start of Operation Barbarossa, when TƒÉtƒÉrescu had accompanied Antonescu, \\"thus making common cause with his warmongering action\\". At the time, his daughter Sandra TƒÉtƒÉrescu Negropontes worked as an ambulance driver for the Romanian Red Cross. In the end, TƒÉtƒÉrescu became involved in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania's cause following the inevitable defeat; he thus corresponded with Edvard Bene≈°, leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England.Tejchman Bene≈°, who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with Richard Franasovici and Grigore Gafencu, and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the Allied governments of TƒÉtƒÉrescu's designs. TƒÉtƒÉrescu later contrasted his diplomatic approach with the strategy of Barbu »òtirbey (who had only attempted an agreement with the Western Allies in Cairo, instead of opening relations with the Soviets). Initially meeting with the refusal of Iuliu Maniu and Dinu BrƒÉtianu (who decided to invest their trust in »òtirbey), he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless: the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Socialist Peasants' Party, leading to the formation of the short-lived and unstable National Democratic Bloc (BND) in June 1944. It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful King Michael Coup. Alliance with the Communists TƒÉtƒÉrescu returned to the PNL later in 1944‚Äîafter the Soviet Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, TƒÉtƒÉrescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and Gheorghe I. BrƒÉtianu, and split to form his own group in June‚ÄìJuly 1945.Hitchins, p.502; »öurlea, p.29 Dinu BrƒÉtianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded TƒÉtƒÉrescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes. As the PCR, which was growing more influential (with the backing of Soviet occupation) while generally lacking popular appeal, sought to form alliances with various forces in order to increase its backing, TƒÉtƒÉrescu declared his group to be left-wing and Social liberal, while attempting to preserve a middle course in the new political setting, by pleading for close relations to be maintained with both the Soviet Union and the Western Allies.Hitchins, p.502, 506; »öurlea, p.30, 31 N. D. Cocea, a prominent socialist who had joined the PNL, represented the faction in talks for an alliance with the Communists.FrunzƒÉ, p.147 The agreement, favored by Ana Pauker, was vehemently opposed by another member of the Communist leadership, Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, who argued in favor of \\"making a distinction inside the bourgeoisie\\",PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, in Betea, and collaborating with the main PNL, while calling TƒÉtƒÉrescu's faction \\"a gang of con artists, blackmailers, and well-known bribers\\".PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, in Betea TƒÉtƒÉrescu became Foreign Minister and vice president of the government in the cabinet of Petru Groza when the latter came into office after Soviet pressures in 1945; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries‚ÄîFinance, with three successive office-holders (of whom the last was Alexandru Alexandrini), Public Works, with Gheorghe V√¢ntu,Cioroianu, p.97; FrunzƒÉ, p.187, 308 Industry (with Petre N. Bejan), and Religious Affairs, with Radu Ro»ôcule»õ. He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an electoral fraud during the general election in 1946 by failing to reply to American proposals for organizing fair elections.Hitchins, p.517 At the Paris Conference,The delegation he headed included Florica Bagdasar, Miti»õƒÉ Constantinescu, General Dumitru DƒÉmƒÉceanu, Dimitrie DimƒÉncescu, Richard Franasovici, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Horia Grigorescu, Ion Gheorghe Maurer, Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Lothar RƒÉdƒÉceanu, Mihai Ralea, Simion Stoilow, Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu, »òerban Voinea, and »òtefan Voitec.

Delegation, at the Romanian Honorary Consulate in Boston site) where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu- Dej and PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, he acknowledged the dissolution of Greater Romania under the provisions of the new Treaty (1947).Hitchins, p.526 1947 and after Tensions between his group with the PCR occurred when the former founded itself as a party under the name of National-Liberal Party (commonly known as the National Liberal Party-TƒÉtƒÉrescu), and, in June‚ÄìJuly 1945, proclaimed its goal to be the preservation of property and a middle class under a new regime.FrunzƒÉ, p.121; Hitchins, p.510-511, 515, 538; »öurlea, p.31 Of himself and his principles, TƒÉtƒÉrescu stated: > \\"I am not a communist. Taking in view my attitudes towards mankind, society, > property, I am not a communist. Thus, the new orientation in external > politics which I demand for my country cannot be accused of being determined > by affinities or sympathies of doctrine.\\"TƒÉtƒÉrescu, in »öurlea, p.31 Speaking in retrospect, Gheorghiu-Dej indicated the actual relation between his party and TƒÉtƒÉrescu's: \\"we have had to tolerate by our side a capitalist- gentry political group, TƒÉtƒÉrescu's group\\".Gheorghiu-Dej, February 1948, in FrunzƒÉ, p.121 TƒÉtƒÉrescu himself continued to show his support for several PCR policies: in the summer of 1947, he condemned the United States for having protested against the repression of forces in the opposition.Hitchins, p.533 Nevertheless, at around the same time, he issued his own critique of the Groza government, becoming the target of violent attacks initiated by Miron Constantinescu in the PCR press.Cioroianu, p.96-97 Consequently, he was singled out for negligence in office when, during the kangaroo trial of Iuliu Maniu (see TƒÉmƒÉdƒÉu Affair), it was alleged that several employees of his ministry had conspired against the government.FrunzƒÉ, p.307-308; Hitchins, p.538 Sc√Ænteia, the official voice of the PCR, wrote of all National Liberal Party-TƒÉtƒÉrescu offices in the government: \\"The rot is all-encompassing! It has to be removed!\\".Sc√Ænteia, 6 November 1947, in FrunzƒÉ, p.121 TƒÉtƒÉrescu resigned his office on 6 November 1947, and was replaced by the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures,Hitchins, p.538 and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan‚Äîthe party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan).FrunzƒÉ, p.357; Hitchins, p.538 One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.Cioroianu, p.74 After the proclamation of the People's Republic of Romania on 30 December 1947, the existence of all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after the elections of 28 March the one-party state was confirmed by legislation.FrunzƒÉ, p.357 He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prisonGogan; Ioni»õoiu; Rusan (alongside three of his brothers‚Äî»òtefan TƒÉtƒÉrescu included‚Äîand his former collaborator Bejan).Rusan His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, and had to be committed to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra TƒÉtƒÉrescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin. One of Gheorghe TƒÉtƒÉrescu's last appearances in public was his stand as one of the prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier (PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges).Cioroianu, p.228; Ioni»õoiu Released in 1955, TƒÉtƒÉrescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later.Gogan; Petru According to Sanda TƒÉtƒÉrescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.

A transport pilot in the Royal Air Force, Lord received the award posthumously for his actions during the Battle of Arnhem while flying resupply missions in support of British paratroops. Early life David Lord was born on 18 October 1913 in Cork, Ireland, one of three sons of Samuel (a Warrant Officer in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers)Ashcroft, p. 355 and Mary Lord (n√©e Miller). One of Lord's brothers died in infancy. After the First World War the family were posted to British India and Lord attended Lucknow Convent School. On his father's retirement from the Army the family moved to Wrexham and then David was a pupil at St Mary's College, Aberystwyth, and then the University of Wales. Later, he attended the English College, Valladolid, Spain to study for the priesthood. Deciding that it was not the career for him, he returned to Wrexham, before moving to London in the mid-1930s to work as a freelance writer. Second World War Lord enlisted in the Royal Air Force on 6 August 1936. After reaching the rank of corporal in August 1938, he applied to undertake pilot training, which he began in October 1938. Successfully gaining his pilot's wings, he became a sergeant pilot in April 1939, and was posted to No. 31 Squadron RAF, based in Lahore, India. He later flew the Vickers Valentia biplane transport. In 1941, No. 31 Squadron was the first unit to receive the Douglas DC-2 which was followed by both the Douglas DC-3 and Dakota transports. That year he was promoted to flight sergeant and then warrant officer. He flew in North Africa, supporting troops in Libya and Egypt for four months, before being posted back to India. Commissioned as a pilot officer in May 1942, he flew supply missions over Burma, for which he was mentioned in despatches. Lord was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in July 1943, receiving the award at Buckingham Palace, and was promoted to flight lieutenant shortly afterwards. By January 1944, he had joined No. 271 Squadron (based at RAF Down Ampney, Gloucestershire) and began training as part of preparations for the invasion of Europe. On D-Day, Lord carried paratroopers into France and his aircraft was hit by flak, returning to base without flaps. =Battle of Arnhem= The Battle of Arnhem was part of Operation Market Garden, an attempt to secure a string of bridges through the Netherlands. At Arnhem, the British 1st Airborne Division and Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade were tasked with securing bridges across the Lower Rhine, the final objectives of the operation. However, the airborne forces that dropped on 17 September were not aware that the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer divisions were also near Arnhem for rest and refit.Middlebrook, p. 67 Their presence added a substantial number of Panzergrenadiers, tanks and self- propelled guns to the German defences and the Allies suffered heavily in the ensuing battle. Only a small force managed to hold one end of the Arnhem road bridge before being overrun on 21 September. The rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket west of the bridge and had to be evacuated on 25 September. The Allies failed to cross the Rhine, which remained under German control until Allied offensives in March 1945.Kershaw, p. 303 =Resupply flights= A German photograph of a supply drop over Arnhem Lord was 30 years old, and a flight lieutenant serving with No. 271 Squadron, Royal Air Force during the Second World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 19 September 1944, during the Battle of Arnhem in the Netherlands, the British 1st Airborne Division was in desperate need of supplies. Lord's Douglas Dakota III \\"KG374\\" encountered intense enemy anti-aircraft fire and was twice hit, with one engine burning. Lord managed to drop his supplies, but at the end of the run found that there were two containers remaining. Although he knew that one of his wings might collapse at any moment, he nevertheless made a second run to drop the last supplies, then ordered his crew to bail out. A few seconds later, the Dakota crashed in flames with its pilot and six crew members.Rodgers, Phil, \\"Dakota Heroes\\", Flypast, Stamford, Lincs., UK, Number 53, December 1985, pp. 24‚Äì27. Only the navigator, Flying Officer Harold King, survived, becoming a prisoner of war. It was only on his release in mid-1945, as well as the release of several paratroops from the 10th Parachute Battalion, that the story of Lord's action became known. Lord was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.Ashcroft, p. 357 Victoria Cross citation A Victoria Cross The full citation for Lord's VC appeared in a supplement to the London Gazette on 9 November 1945, reading: Legacy The memorial to Lord at Wrexham Cathedral After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead.Waddy, p. 190 Lord was buried alongside his crew in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery.Middlebrook, p. 470 There are many plaques in memory of him, including one at Wrexham Cathedral in Wales. Several aircraft have carried tributes to Lord. Between 1993 and 1998, the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Dakota, serial \\"ZA947\\", was painted in the colours of Lord's aircraft during the Arnhem battle, and bore the same code letters: YS-DM. Between 1973 and 2005, the Dakota displayed at RAF Museum Cosford was similarly painted and coded to represent Lord's aircraft. From 1966 until its disbandment in 2005, No. 10 Squadron RAF was equipped with Vickers VC-10s, each of which was named after a Royal Air Force or Royal Flying Corps VC recipient. Aircraft serial number 'XR810' was named David Lord VC. Lord's Victoria Cross was presented to his parents at Buckingham Palace in December 1945. In 1997, Lord's VC, along with his other decorations and medals, were sold at auction by Spinks to Lord Ashcroft. As of 2014, the medal group was on display at the Imperial War Museum.

Appointed as the chief judge over several districts near Nishapur in Iran, and Baghdad itself, al-Mawardi also served as a diplomat for the Abbasid caliphs al-Qa'im and al-Qadir in negotiations with the Buyid emirs. He is best known for his treatise on \\"The Ordinances of Government.\\" The Ordinances, Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya w'al-Wilayat al-Diniyya, provide a detailed definition of the functions of caliphate government which, under the Buyids, appeared to be rather indefinite and ambiguous.  Biography  Al-Mawardi was born in Basrah during the year 972 C.E. Some authors make the claim that his family was Kurdish,Abul-Fazl Ezzati, The Spread of Islam: The Contributing Factors, ICAS Press (2002), p. 384 a claim which is unsubstantiated.Library of Congress: Rules for Governing. accessed September 2016. The Shafi'i historian al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 463/1072) recorded his father as being a rose-water seller. Growing up he was able to learn Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) from Abu al-Wahid al-Simari and subsequently took up his residence in Baghdad. While both Basrah and Baghdad were centers of the Mu'tazila school of thought, the great (orthodox) Shafi'i jurist al-Subki (d. 756/1355) would later condemn al-Mawardi for his Mu'tazila sympathies. He was eventually appointed chief qadi of Baghdad, and subsequently was entrusted with various responsibilities on behalf of the Caliphate: On four occasions he served as a diplomat on behalf of Caliph al-Qa'im (422-1031, 428/1037, 434/1042 and 435/1043), his successor al-Qadir also entrusted al-Mawardi as a diplomat in a negotiation with the Buyid emirs and charged him with the task of writing his treatise on \\"The Ordinances of the Government.\\" Among many of his various other works he is also credited with the creation of darura, a doctrine of necessity.

Hence the emphasis in [The Ordinances] placed on the qualifications, power and duties pertinent to [a given office of government]... This approach to the matter would explain the working arrangement finally reached by the Buyids and the Abbasid caliphs, later followed also by the more efficient Seljuqs, whereby the military held actual power while recognizing the Caliph as the supreme head of government and receiving from him, in turn, recognition of their mundane authority.\\"Introduction to \\"The Ordinances of Government\\", trans., Wafaa H.

Biography Edmund Clarence Stedman was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on October 8, 1833; his father, Major Edmund Burke Stedman died of tuberculosis two years later in December 1835. By the following spring, his mother Elizabeth Clementine Stedman moved the boy and his younger brother to Plainfield, New Jersey to live with her wealthy father, David Low Dodge. Dodge, a Calvinist and pacifist, was strict, did not want to use his finances to support his grandchildren, and often physically punished the boys for bad behavior. Mrs. Stedman sold poems and stories to magazines including Graham's Magazine, Sartain's Magazine, The Knickerbocker, and Godey's Lady's Book for income. Eventually, the children were taken in by their paternal grandfather, Griffin Stedman, and his brother James in Norwich, Connecticut. Stedman studied two years at Yale University; became a journalist in New York City, especially on the staffs of the Tribune and World, for which latter paper he served as field correspondent during the first years of the Civil War. As opportunity offered, he studied law and was for a time private secretary to Attorney-General Bates at Washington, and was a member of the New York Stock Exchange in Wall Street from 1865 to 1900. His first book, Poems, Lyrical and Idyllic, appeared in 1860, followed by successive volumes of similar character, and by collected editions of his verse in 1873, 1884 and 1897. His longer poems are Alice of Monmouth: an Idyl of the Great War (1864); The Blameless Prince (1869), an allegory of good deeds, supposed to have been remotely suggested by the life of Prince Albert; and an elaborate commemorative ode on Nathaniel Hawthorne, read before the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1877. An idyllic atmosphere is the prevalent characteristic of his longer pieces, while the lyric tone is never absent from his songs, ballads and poems of reflection or fancy. As an editor he put forth a volume of Cameos from Walter Savage Landor (with Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 1874); a large Library of (selections from) American Literature (with Ellen M Hutchinson, 11 vols, 1888‚Äì1890); a Victorian Anthology (1895); and an American Anthology, 1787‚Äì1899 (1900); the two last-named volumes being ancillary to a detailed and comprehensive critical study in prose of the whole body of English poetry from 1837, and of American poetry of the 19th century. This study appeared in separate chapters in Scribner's Monthly (which closed in 1881 and was relaunched the same year as the Century Magazine), and was reissued, with enlargements, in the volumes entitled Victorian Poets (1875; continued to the Jubilee year in the edition of 1887) and Poets of America (1885), the two works forming the most symmetrical body of literary criticism yet published in the United States. Their value is increased by the treatise on The Nature and Elements of Poetry (Boston, 1892) a work of great critical insight as well as technical knowledge. Stedman edited, with Ellen M. Hutchinson, A Library of American Literature (eleven volumes, 1888‚Äì90); and, with George E. Woodberry, the Works of Edgar Allan Poe (ten volumes, 1895). After the death of James Russell Lowell, Stedman had perhaps the leading place among American poets and critics.

In 1879, he proposed a rigid airship inspired by the anatomy of a fish, with a framework of steel, brass, or copper tubing and a tractor propeller mounted on the crafts bow, later changed to an engine with two propellers suspended beneath the framework. The airship never was built, but its design foreshadowed that of the dirigibles of the early decades of the 20th century.Whitehouse, Arch. The Zeppelin Fighters. New York: Ace Books, 1966: 15.

The channels closed on 19 August 2010. History Sky Real Lives first launched as Sky Travel on 3 October 1994, and became part of the Sky Multichannels package. It originally broadcast between Monday and Thursday between midday and midnight and on Friday between 12pm and 6am until September 1997. In 2001, the channel started broadcasting 7 days a week from 6am until 11pm. The channel was revamped in September 2002. Sky Travel Extra and the main channel launched with Freeview on 30 October 2002, along with Sky News and Sky Sports News. In February 2003, a spin-off of the channels, Sky Travel Shop, launched a dedicated travel retail channel in the Specialist, then Shopping section of the EPG. In September 2003 both channels were launched on the NTL platform. With increased distribution, Sky Travel changed its programming strategy to attract a wider audience, skewing towards stronger entertainment programs with a travel theme, particularly reality shows. By August 2004, the core channel was broadcasting 24 hours a day and in January 2005, a timeshifted version of Sky Travel was launched. In October 2005, Sky Travel on Freeview was replaced by Sky Three and in March 2006, the Sky Travel channels were moved from the \\"Entertainment\\" section on the Sky EPG, to the \\"Lifestyle and Culture\\" section. In August 2006, Sky Travel began showing reality TV, whilst Sky Travel Extra dedicated its airtime to documentaries Sky Real Lives 2, the replacement channel for Sky Travel Extra, gained additional broadcast hours from its launch. From 2002 until 2007, Sky Real Lives 2 only aired from 6am until 1am. However, on 7 November, the channel began 24-hour broadcasts. Sky Real Lives programmes were showcased on Sky's main channels; Sky1, Sky2, but mostly on its free-to-air sister channel, Sky3 (now known as Pick). Changes on Freeview In 2004, Sky Travel showed the first two episodes of the fourth season of US drama 24, simulcasting with Sky's primary channel, Sky One. This led to rumours that the company had planned to turn Sky Travel into a general entertainment channel on Freeview. However, BSkyB's CEO, James Murdoch, had repeatedly denied the company had any plans to launch any new free-to-air services. BSkyB's stance on the subject has since changed. On 22 September 2005, it was announced that Sky Travel would be replaced on Freeview by new entertainment channel Sky Three. Although some of Sky Travel's programming will form part of the schedule of Sky Three, Sky Travel itself will still be shown on Sky Digital. Sky Travel ceased to be broadcast on Freeview at 5pm on 31 October 2005. Sky Travel relaunches as Sky Real Lives On 17 September 2007, Sky announced plans to rebrand Sky Travel to Sky Real Lives from 7 November 2007. The new channel focused on programmes with a human interest story and was targeted more at women in the 35‚Äì54 age range. Sky's managing director of entertainment Sophie Turner Laing said it seems that the channel would be given a \\"whole new makeover\\" that would make it more entertainment oriented. On 7 November, the following channels were changed: Sky Travel was renamed as Sky Real Lives, Sky Travel +1 was renamed Sky Real Lives +1, Sky Travel Extra renamed to Sky Real Lives 2, and Sky Travel Shop was also renamed to Sky Travel. Sky Real Lives, Sky Real Lives 2, Sky Arts 1 and Sky Arts 2 were launched on UPC Ireland, before being removed on 8 December 2008. Closure On 16 June 2010, it was announced that Sky Real Lives, and its portfolio of channels would close on 19 August 2010, with the channels budget shifting to Sky1 and Sky2. Sky Real Lives closed at midnight on 19 August 2010.

In 2008 it was rebranded as 4Music. Overview and availability The channel showcased a range of pop centred on chart hits and current favourites. Originally, the vast majority of music videos were selected by viewers by means of calling a premium-rate telephone number, however the policy was abandoned with the channel playing an automated selection of videos and countdown shows presented by celebrities and singers past and present. Programming was often themed to coincide with events such as St. Patrick's Day and Christmas. The channel was available free-to-air on the British digital terrestrial television service Freeview on channel 18. It was also available on Sky Digital, encrypted as a part of Sky's Music Pack. The Hits was also available on Virgin Media and was included in the basic package. It was also able to be seen through the British Forces Broadcasting Service. Programmes on The Hits 87-07 is a series of programmes where a song is played from each of the years from 1987 to 2007. There was a more up to date version called 88-08 which is the same as 87-07 except it goes from 1988 to 2008. There were different collections of songs depending on different things that the songs had in common, an example of 87-07 is Cheesy Pop 87-07 which includes the songs \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley, \\"Saturday Night\\" by Whigfield and \\"C'est la Vie\\" by B*Witched which are all commonly regarded as \\"cheesy pop songs\\". Another type of programme on The Hits was where one hundred songs are played, usually counting down to a song that is featured as \\"number one\\". This varies from 100 Forgotten Gems of the Nineties to The Nation's Favourite Love Songs. Similarly formatted programmes with fifty or twenty songs were also broadcast. The Hits Chart was played at around 12.15 and 17:15 Monday-Friday. The Hits Chart was simply a countdown of the biggest songs of the day. The Hits had a programme called Every Number One of the Nineties which, as the title suggests, played every number one of the nineties back to back. It was played over a bank holiday weekend in two parts, the first part on the Sunday and the second part on the Monday. Every Number One of the Nineties has been played on 4Music in small segments. A similar programme was Every Number One of the Twenty-first Century. Early in the morning, there was a programme called \\"Signed by The Hits\\". This programme's duration was usually 30 minutes. The programme involved a sign language interpreter signing to the songs on screen to help deaf people understand the music. Due to persistent criticism, the show was removed. Replacement with 4Music On 20 February 2008, it was announced that The Hits would change its name 4Music later in the year, and a trial period broadcast on Sundays under the 4Music banner was broadcast on Sunday evenings during the spring. In June 2008 it was further announced that this replacement was to take place during the V Festival weekend on 15 August. The replaced station shows predominantly music videos, alongside live performances and Channel 4 programming like Star Stories and The Sunday Night Project, in addition to documentaries about artists. In the weeks before the launch, 4Music aired teaser trailers for the channel as part of its extensive promotion of the rebrand and as part of the promotion one of the three stages for T4 On The Beach was named the 4Music stage. The Hits ceased broadcasting music videos on Friday 15 August 2008 at 06:00. The last video played on The Hits was \\"Thank You for the Music\\" by ABBA, before heading in to a promo for 4Music, which would be launched from 7:00pm. Ofcom controversy In November 2007, Ofcom found The Hits had breached its broadcast licence for failing to retain copies of its programming. Two viewers had complained questioning the authenticity of some of the winning entries on text-in quiz programme Win Win TV, broadcast overnight on 26 June. The broadcaster was unable to provide Ofcom with a review copy of the programme in question because of \\"problems with its logging system\\". Condition 11 of a Television Licensable Content Service licence requires the broadcaster to keep recordings of all output for 60 days after transmission, providing Ofcom with any material on request. \\"Failure to supply these recordings is a serious and significant breach of the broadcaster‚Äôs licence. This will be held on record,\\" the regulator noted. The Hits Radio In 2003, companion radio station The Hits Radio was launched. It ceased broadcasting on 4 June 2018 with Joe Cooper presenting the breakfast show.

A bishop in Hungarian-ruled Transylvania, Cristea was elected Metropolitan-Primate of the Orthodox Church of the newly unified Greater Romania in 1919. As the Church was raised to a rank of Patriarchate, Miron Cristea was enthroned as the first Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church in 1925. In 1938, after Carol II banned political parties and established a royal dictatorship, he chose Cristea to be Prime Minister of Romania, a position from which he served for about a year, between 11 February 1938, and his death.

Returning to Transylvania, he was a secretary (between 1895 and 1902), then a counselor (1902‚Äì1909) at the Archbishopric of Sibiu. It was then that he was ordained deacon in 1900 and archdeacon in 1901. Cristea became a monk at the Hodo»ô Bodrog Monastery, Arad County in 1902, taking the monastic name of Miron. He climbed the monastery hierarchy, becoming an archmonk in 1903 and a protosingel in 1908. In 1908, following the death of bishop Nicolae Popea, the election of the bishop of Caransebe≈ü led to a dispute between the Romanian Orthodox Church and the Imperial authorities, when, twice in a row, the elected bishops were not recognized by emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, at the recommendation of the Hungarian government. Cristea was the third choice, being chosen on 21 November 1910, and obtaining the recognition from the authorities;Anton DrƒÉgoiescu (editor), \\"PoliticƒÉ, bisericƒÉ »ôi »ôcoalƒÉ la sa»ôii ardeleni √Æn perioada dualismului (1867‚Äì1918)\\", in Istoria Transilvaniei, Editura \\"George Bari»õiu\\", Cluj-Napoca, 1999, p. 248 he became an archbishop in 1919. During World War I, as Romania joined the war on the Allies' side, Cristea signed on 1 September 1916, a public letter to the parishioners printed at Oradea by the Orthodox Bishopric of Transylvania. The letter called to arms all believers against \\"Romania the new enemy which sinfully covets to ruin the borders, coming to conquer Transylvania\\".Octavian Paler, \\"√éntrebƒÉri la care nu voiam sƒÉ ajung\\" , in Cotidianul, 4 April 2006 The Transylvanian delegation (Vasile Goldi»ô, Cristea, Iuliu Hossu, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, Caius Brediceanu) that brought to Bucharest the Unification Act of Transylvania with Romania Towards the end of World War I, on 18 October 1918, the Central National Romanian Central Council was formed, an organization which fought for the union of Transylvania and Romania. On 21 November, Cristea, as archbishop of Caransebe»ô joined the organization and recognized it as the only ruling body of the Romanian nation in Transylvania. On 1 December, he was (with Vasile Goldi»ô, Iuliu Hossu, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod) a member of Austro-Hungarian Romanian delegation that called for the unification of Romania and Transylvania.Mircea PƒÉcurariu, \\"Slujitorii altarului »ôi Marea Unire\\" , in Magazin Istoric, no. 1 / 1999 On 28 May 1919, the King and government of Romania went to the grave of Michael the Brave in C√¢mpia Turzii and Bishop Cristea lead the religious service of commemoration and held a nationalist speech in which he drew a parallel between King Ferdinand I and Michael the Brave and recommended the King to not stop at Turda, but continuing all the way to the Tisa River.Lucian Leu»ôtean, Orthodoxy and the Cold War, Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, , pp. 39‚Äì41 = Metropolitan-Primate and Patriarch = Because of his collaboration with the German occupation troops, the Metropolitan-Primate Conon ArƒÉmescu-Donici was forced to resign on 1 December 1919 and on 31 December 1919, Cristea was chosen by the Great Electoral College as the first Metropolitan-Primate of Greater Romania with 435 votes out of 447. The Romanian Orthodox Church was elevated to a patriarchate in 1925. On 1 November 1925, after a Synod was held, Cristea was named Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church.\\"Patriarhii care au fƒÉcut politica Domnului, uneori »ôi pe cea a Rom√¢niei\\", in AdevƒÉrul, 4 August 2007 As Metropolitan-Primate and later Patriarch, Cristea continued the tradition of his predecessors to support whatever government was in power. The church acted as an agency of the state, for instance, in 1920, Cristea asked the clergymen to aid the state financially by encouraging the faithful to buy government bonds. Cristea's discourse incorporated nationalist and statist elements, arguing that Orthodox religion was integral to the Romanian soul, and he argued that the church's values include \\"patriotism\\" and \\"obedience to [civil] authorities\\" alongside \\"faith and morality\\". Cristea introduced reforms such as the Gregorian calendar to the church, including, briefly, the celebration of Pascha (Easter) on the same date as the Roman Catholic Church. This was opposed by various groups of traditionalists and Old Calendarists, especially in Moldavia, where Metropolitan Gurie Grosu of Bessarabia refused to accept the orders given by the Patriarchate. Standard of the Regent of Romania (1927‚Äì1930) In 1927, he was chosen by Ionel BrƒÉtianu to be one of the three regents of King Michael I of Romania, alongside Prince Nicholas of Romania and Gheorghe Buzdugan.\\"Speech from the Throne\\", in Time Magazine, 7 January 1929Keith Hitchins, Rumania : 1866‚Äì1947 (Oxford History of Modern Europe). Oxford University Press, 1994 p. 413 Cristea's involvement in politics was, however, controversial, being criticised by journalists at Epoca newspaper, who accused him of trying to play the role of Rasputin and being a member of the palace camarilla. This resulted in the issue being confiscated by the police and their offices being vandalized by hooligans, allegedly incited by the government.\\"Edit Bucharest paper with pistols handy\\", The New York Times, 20 April 1926, p. 27 A dispute arose with philosopher Nae Ionescu after Ionescu attacked Cristea for hypocrisy in newspaper articles following a lavish dinner with Cristea during the Nativity Fast at which they were served turkey. In retaliation, Cristea requested that the iconographer Belizarie paint Ionescu's face on a devil in the Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest's Apocalypse-themed mural.Dan Ciachir, Istoria presei, Ziua, 3 February 2007 In 1929, because of a serious illness (identified as leucocythemia by his medics), Cristea retired for several months to a country house in Dragoslavele, Muscel County, but despite the bleak predictions about his health state, he was soon able to return to Bucharest.\\"Roumania Patriarch Feared Near Death\\", The Washington Post, 16 September 1929, p. 2 On 6 July 1930, Carol II returned to Romania to assume power. On 7 July, Miron Cristea and Constantin SƒÉrƒÉ»õeanu resigned from the regency and the following day, the Parliament revoked the 1926 law which gave the throne to Mihai, Carol becoming King again.Ioan Scurtu, \\"Principele Nicolae a»ôa cum a fost\\" , in Magazin Istoric, no. 11 / 2000 Cristea kept his loyalty to King Carol II throughout his rule. In March 1937, as the King attempted to suppress the influence of the fascist movement known as the Iron Guard, Cristea responded to the request sent by the TƒÉtƒÉrescu government on limiting the relationship between the clergy and the Iron Guard. Cristea invoked a Holy Synod which banned clergy from joining the Legion and disallowed political demonstrations and symbols in the churches.Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania, Polirom, Ia»ôi, 2004. p. 25-26 =Prime Minister of Romania= In a bid for political unity against the Iron Guard, which was gaining popularity, in 1938, Carol dismissed the government of Prime Minister Octavian Goga and seized emergency powers. He suspended the constitution, suspended all political activity, and ruled by decree. Cristea was named Prime Minister on 11 February 1938. He headed a government that included seven former prime ministers and members of all major parties except for Codreanu's Iron Guard and Goga's LƒÉncieri, which had violently clashed.\\"Patriarch forms cabinet as anti-semitic regime of Goga falls in Rumania\\", The New York Times, 11 February 1938, p. 1 Time magazine described him as a \\"puppet Premier\\" of Carol II,\\"Noble Gesture\\", in Time, 24 April 1939 whereas historian Joseph Rothschild considered that it was Cristea's vice-prime-minister, Armand CƒÉlinescu, who held the power in the Cristea government.Joseph Rothschild, East Central Europe Between the Two World Wars, 1990 University of Washington Press, p. 311 In his inaugural speech, Cristea denounced liberal pluralism, arguing that \\"the monster with 29 electoral heads was destroyed\\" (referring to the 29 political parties which were to be banned) and claiming that the king shall bring salvation.Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, \\"The Ruler and the Patriarch: The Romanian Eastern Orthodox Church in Transition\\" , East European Constitutional Review, Volume 7 Number 2, Spring 1998 The new government stopped the antisemitic violence that was unleashed under Goga's rule, but the antisemitic legislation in place was not altered, as Nichifor Crainic's racist, fascist ideology fit comfortably with the social views and political theology of the Romanian Orthodox Church. At Carol's direction, Cristea's government declared state of siege, which allowed among other things, searches without warrant and the military appropriation of privately held guns. He also imposed harsh press censorship and restored the death penalty. However, Cristea promised prosperity through some constitutional and social reforms, which were to include the \\"organized emigration of Jewish surplus population\\", that is, expulsion of all Jews who came to Romania during or after World War I. However, it eased the anti-Semitic restrictions imposed by the Goga government.\\"Carol names body to draft chapter of people's rights\\", The New York Times, 13 February 1938, p. 1AP, \\"Rumania Seeking to Patch Up Alliance With France, Britain\\", The Washington Post, 12 February 1938, p. X1 The external politics of the Cristea government were based on seeking an alliance with the United Kingdom and France, away from the friendship with the Berlin- Rome Axis supported by the Goga government. Cristea also visited Poland, with which Romania had an alliance and with which it tried to create a neutral block between Nazi Germany and the USSR.\\"Polish-Rumanian staff talks: Common defence\\", The Manchester Guardian, 31 May 1938, p. 6 Among the policies Cristea introduced during his rule as Prime Minister was a crackdown on the Protestant minority, by disallowing religious service to small congregations with less than 100 heads of families, basically banning the services in around 1500 small chapels belonging to various non-Orthodox Christian denominations. Despite worldwide protests from the Baptists, the ban was only lifted after Cristea's death by his successor, the National Renaissance Front's Armand CƒÉlinescu. On 20 February, a new constitution was announced, which organized Romania as a \\"corporatist state\\" similar to the one of Fascist Italy, with a parliament made up of representatives of the guilds of farmers, workers and intellectuals.\\"Rumania Made a Fascist State by King's Edict\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, 21 February 1938, p. 1 Four days later, on 24 February, the constitution was approved, with 99.87% of votes for, through a plebiscite, described by a contemporary article in The Manchester Guardian as a \\"farse\\" for its lack of vote secrecy and the lack of information given to rural voters .\\"King Carol's Romania: Recent Steps on the Path to a Royal Dictatorship; Measures against the Jews\\", in Manchester Guardian, 31 March 1938, p. 6 Upon the approval of the new constitution, Cristea's government resigned on 30 March. He formed a new government later that day. The new government banned all political parties, their activity being only suspended before that.\\"Rumanian Cabinet Resigns to Form New Government\\", The Christian Science Monitor, 30 March 1938, p. 1 In March 1938, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, attacked in a letter the politicians who supported Carol II, including Prime Minister Cristea and members of his government. Codreanu was arrested for slander against Nicolae Iorga and killed \\"while attempting to escape\\". By the end of 1938, Carol II introduced even more Fascist-inspired elements.

He stayed in Cannes for treatment, but died two weeks later, on 6 March, of bronchopneumonia complicated by heart disease. His body was sent by train to Bucharest, the funeral train stopping in all stations in Romania to permit believers to pay their last respects and say prayers before the body. On 7 March, a state of national mourning was ordered and all festivities were canceled.\\"Rumania will honor body of patriarch\\" in The New York Times 8 March 1939, pg. 8 A week later, on 14 March, funeral services were held in Bucharest,\\"Obituary\\", The New York Times, 15 March 1939; p. 29 Cristea being buried in the Patriarchal Cathedral.

Spicer, Antisemitism, Christian Ambivalence, and the Holocaust, 2007, Indiana University Press pp. 147‚Äì150 =Toward other Christian denominations= As he became the head of the Orthodox Church in Greater Romania, a multiethnic and multireligious state, Cristea feared that the ethnic minorities, as well as Romanians belonging to non-Orthodox creeds such as the Greek-Catholicism and the Jews would challenge the privileged status which the Orthodox Church had in pre-World War I Romania. Nevertheless, Cristea attempted an ecumenical close-up with the Anglican Church, by visiting Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1936.\\"Death of Premier of Romania\\", in Manchester Guardian, 7 March 1939, page 6\\"Rumanian Patriarch to be Primate's Guest\\", The Manchester Guardian 5 June 1936, p. 10 Cristea strongly opposed the idea of a Concordat with the Vatican and the Romanian Orthodox Church issued a statement against it saying that \\"the treaty subordinates the interests of the country and the sovereignty of the state to a foreign power\\".Catherine Durandin Orthodoxie et Roumanit√©: Le d√©bat de l'entre deux guerres, in Rumanian studies 1980‚Äì1986, E. J. Brill, Leiden, 1986 p. 116 The Romanian Senate ratified it anyway on 26 May 1929, and Cristea, as a member of the regency, was forced to sign it. This has led again to discussions about the incompatibility between his two posts and there were discussions on whether Cristea would have resigned rather than sign the Concordat.\\"Concordat approved by Rumanian Senate\\", in The New York Times, 27 May 1929, pg. 7 After Cristea introduced reforms such as switching to the Gregorian calendar, the Old Calendar Romanian Orthodox Church, led by Glicherie TƒÉnase seceded many parishes from the Orthodox Church and by 1936 they had built more than 40 churches. However, after 1935, the Romanian government began to suppress any opposition to the Orthodox Church and the churches were razed and some of the activists the imprisoned, while a number of clerics, including hieromonk Pambo and five monks from the Old Calendarist Cucova Monastery, were beaten to death.\\"Patimile Bisericii Ortodoxe de Stil Vechi\\", Evenimentul Zilei, 4 January 2004Ken Parry et al., The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity, 2001, Wiley-Blackwell, p. 355 Protests against the authorities' actions were met with repression by police and the leader of Old Calendarists, TƒÉnase, was accused of being an instigator and sentenced to death. In 1937, William Temple, the Archbishop of York, sent a letter to Cristea in which he questioned religious freedom in Romania, referring especially to the treatment of the Baptists. Cristea denied such claims and responded in a long document in which he said Temple was misled by the \\"perverse propaganda\\" and the \\"false mystification\\" of the Magyars, as well as the \\"ferocious and barbaric proselytism of the Pope\\". He further added, referring to neo-Protestants, that Romania should not allow to be \\"undermined by foreigners dressed in innocent pseudo-religious garb\\".Sabrina P. Ramet, Protestantism and politics in eastern Europe and Russia: the communist and postcommunist eras, Duke University Press, 1992, pp. 177‚Äì178 =Toward the Jews= Early during his tenure as Patriarch, Cristea supported tolerance towards the Jewish people. For instance, in 1928, he made an appeal towards the Romanian students to observe the Golden Rule and he expressed regrets for attacks and profanations of synagogues. In the 1930s, as the Fascist Iron Guard rose in popularity, initially, Cristea's position towards them was of acceptance, especially since their program included loyalty to Orthodoxism. Many Orthodox priests were attracted by the movement and it was common that their banners were blessed in churches. In 1937, Cristea realized that the Iron Guard was decreasing the loyalty of both the Orthodox Christians and the lower-ranked clergy to the church hierarchy and began to oppose the Guard, while adopting their anti-semitic and xenophobic rhetoric: he supported the revocation of the Romanian citizenship for Jewish people and their deportation, the Jews being in his opinion the major obstacle in \\"assuring preponderant rights to ethnic Romanians\\". On 18 August 1937, he issued a statement which called the Romanian nation \\"to fight the Jewish parasites\\"Johan Martinus Snoek, The Grey Book.

He was a longtime Chicago alderman and the head of the Cook County Democratic Party until 1987 when he ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Chicago on the Illinois Solidarity Party ticket. He subsequently ran again in 1989 on the Republican Party ticket. He was a prominent opponent of Harold Washington and the de facto leader of the so- called \\"Vrdolyak 29\\" that opposed and blocked many of Washington's measures. After his electoral career ended, he resumed his law practice at The Vrdolyak Law Group. It consists of 20 attorneys. Vrdolyak and his three sons are partners in the firm. Early life Vrdolyak, born to Croatian immigrant parents, entered a Catholic seminary at age 13, but decided against joining the priesthood. He graduated from Mount Carmel High School in Chicago, then from St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana. He received his J.D. degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1963 and began a legal career in private practice, specializing in personal injury cases. Political career In 1968, he was elected as Democratic Committeeman from Chicago's 10th Ward in the Hegewisch and South Deering areas; a position he held until 1988. In 1971, he was elected alderman, and, after defeating Republican Melvin Simonovich, he served as President of the City Council from 1977 to 1983. Vrdolyak earned the nickname \\"Fast Eddie\\" because of his skill in back-room deal-making. In 1979, he managed the re-election campaign of Mayor Michael Bilandic. In a colossal upset, Bilandic narrowly lost to maverick Jane Byrne. Despite the fact that Byrne then stripped Vrdolyak of all powers except his aldermanic seat, he became Byrne's chief ally against both independent and Regular Democrats, becoming her floor leader in the Council. In 1982, with Byrne's support, he was elected Chairman of the Cook County Democratic Committee, ousting County Board President George Dunne. He is most noted for leading the opposition in the City Council to Mayor Harold Washington from 1983 to 1987. After beating Mayor Byrne and Richard M. Daley in the Democratic Primary, Washington barely won the general election. A solid majority of 29 aldermen (27 Regular Democrats and two independents) opposed Washington (21 aldermen supported the mayor). Vrdolyak and 14th Ward Alderman Ed Burke led the opposition group. The Vrdolyak 29 rejected mayoral appointments and appropriations, but could not override the mayor's veto. The resulting political deadlock was labeled \\"Council Wars\\". In 1986, a federal lawsuit forced the redrawing of some aldermanic wards, and special elections in some, but not all, of the redrawn wards. Members of the Vrdolyak 29 were incumbents in all seven of the wards going to the polls. Four of them did not seek reelection, including three who sought seats on the county board. Two of the three attempting to retain their seats were reelected in the first round, but a third, Alderman Brady, lost six weeks later in a run-off; the council was split 25-25, creating a tie which the mayor could break. At this point, several of the Vrdolyak 29 began to support Washington, giving him a supportive council. In 1987, he resigned as county Democratic chairman, and ran for mayor as the Solidarity Party nominee, defeating a candidate backed by Mayor Washington in the primary. He was defeated by Washington, who got 53% of the vote to Vrdolyak's 42%.With Victory in Chicago, Mayor Finally in ControlThe New York Times, April 9, 1987. Washington's second term began more smoothly (he died in November 1987) and Vrdolyak's political clout waned. In light of these factors, as well as his growing unpopularity among Democrats, Vrdolyak joined the Republican Party in September 1987.Ex-Leader of Democrats in Chicago Switches PartyThe New York Times, September 16, 1987. In 1988, Vrdolyak was the Republican nominee for Clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County. He received 41% of the vote; Democrat Aurelia Pucinski (daughter of Alderman and former US Representative Roman Pucinski) won with 59%. In 1989, Vrdolyak again ran for mayor, in a special election for the last half of Washington's term; he won the Republican primary as a write-in candidate. The general election was won by Democrat Richard M. Daley. Vrdolyak managed less than 4% of the vote, effectively ending his political career. After his final electoral defeat, Vrdolyak returned to his law practice. He hosted a popular talk radio show from 1993 to 1996 - first on WLS radio (890 AM) and then on WJJD Radio (1160 AM). He also maintained a strong behind-the-scenes presence in Chicago area politics. He became best known for his influence in the appointment and election of Cook County Circuit Court judges. Illinois Supreme Court Justice Charles Freeman confirmed that at least two judges he appointed to the bench were recommended by Vrdolyak.Justice says Vrdolyak helped pick judgesChicago Sun-Times, May 4, 2000. This would cause problems for Vrdolyak as he was implicated in the case of former Cook County Circuit Court Judge George J.W. Smith. Smith pleaded guilty to federal charges of illegally structuring cash withdrawals to avoid tax penalties. Prosecutors claimed the transactions were in furtherance of an alleged bribe paid to a \\"go-between\\" in order to secure Smith's appointment. Smith was reportedly appointed by Freeman based on Vrdolyak's recommendation, leading to speculation that Vrdolyak was the alleged \\"go-between\\". The investigation did not result in charges of wrongdoing against Vrdolyak, nor in bribery charges against Smith or any other party.Judge gets the maximum Chicago Sun-Times, July 26, 2002. Vrdolyak was also a key adviser to Betty Loren-Maltese, former Town President of the suburb of Cicero. The Vrdolyak Law Group received millions of dollars in legal work from the town of Cicero during the administrations of Loren-Maltese and her successor, Ramiro Gonz√°lez. Maltese was convicted of corruption in 2002 and Gonz√°lez was defeated in the 2005 election. While Vrdolyak was not charged in the Loren- Maltese investigation, his close alliance with the once-imprisoned former Town President was a major issue in the 2005 election. During the campaign, Dominick criticized what he called Vrdolyak's excessive legal bills, and removed Vrdolyak's firm as the town's legal counsel after taking office. However, NBC Chicago reported that the new town attorney, Michael Del Galdo, billed the town over $2 million in 2006‚Äîmore than twice the average billings when Vrdolyak's firm held the contract.Cicero's Legal Fees Double Under Dominick NBC5.com, September 20, 2007.

Federal indictment and conviction On May 10, 2007, Vrdolyak was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of bribery, mail fraud and wire fraud.Feds catch up with 'Fast Eddie' Vrdolyak Chicago Tribune, May 10, 2007. Prosecutors later added additional wire fraud charges, and the final indictment included a total of eight counts. The case centered on property that was sold by the Chicago Medical School. The key witness against Vrdolyak was to be Stuart Levine, a partner in the alleged scheme. Prosecutors charged that Vrdolyak and Levine devised a scheme to use Levine's position on the school's board to steer the $15 million sale of a school building to Smithfield Properties - a developer with ties to Vrdolyak. It was alleged that the two arranged a $1.5 million kickback from Smithfield to Vrdolyak in return for Levine's support. Levine, a close friend and political ally of Vrdolyak, was indicted in 2005 for using his positions on the Illinois Teachers Retirement System board and the Illinois Health Facilities board to obtain kickbacks. Levine pleaded guilty in late 2006 and agreed to testify in several corruption cases as a condition of his plea agreement. Prosecutors dropped 22 felony charges in return for his cooperation. Prosecutors have indicated that Levine wore a recording device while discussing some of the alleged schemes. Political insiders expressed surprise at the idea that Vrdolyak would be caught on tape. A long-time power broker and target of investigations, the notoriously careful Vrdolyak has been quoted as saying that he \\"talk[s] to everyone like they're wearing a wire, even my wife\\". Chicago alderman Bernard Stone noted that Vrdolyak was always careful when talking on the phone, once telling Stone to \\"always talk like the government was on the phone with you\\".Feds: Not So Fast, Eddie Chicago Sun- Times, May 11, 2007. Vrdolyak initially pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Levine also testified at the 2008 trial of Tony Rezko, another powerbroker in Illinois politics. He told the jury that he funneled payoffs for clients who wanted Chicago city contracts through Vrdolyak, including some alleged schemes for which Vrdolyak has not been charged. Monico called Levine's statements in regards to Vrdolyak \\"absolutely false\\" and said that he had never heard them before.Star Witness Tells Rezko Jury of Payoffs Associated Press, March 18, 2008Rezko trial breaks just before discussion of city real estate scheme Daily Herald, April 4, 2008 The trial was set for November 3, 2008.

Early life Havelock was born in Cawnpore, India on 6 August 1830, the son of Major General Sir Henry Havelock and his wife, Hannah n√©e Marshman, the daughter of the missionaries Joshua and Hannah Marshman. Military career Havelock was commissioned as an Ensign in the 39th Regiment of Foot in March 1846, and joined the Regiment in India. Moving to the 86th Foot as a Lieutenant in June 1848, he transferred to the 10th Regiment of Foot in February 1852.

On 16 July 1857 at Cawnpore, the 64th Regiment had suffered badly under artillery fire. When the enemy was seen rallying their last 24-pounder, the order was given to advance, and Havelock immediately placed himself, on his horse, in front of the centre of the 64th, opposite the muzzle of the gun and moved on at a foot pace, in the face of shot and grape fired by the enemy. The advance went steadily on, led by Havelock and finally the gun was rushed and taken by the 64th. For this deed, Havelock was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 25 September 1857 he was badly wounded in the Siege of Lucknow. On returning to England in 1860, Havelock joined his regiment, now the 18th Foot (Royal Irish Regiment), at Shorncliffe. He became deputy assistant adjutant-general at Aldershot on 1 October 1861. He was posted with the 18th Foot to New Zealand in August 1863, where he was appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general and served under Major General Duncan Cameron from 1863 to 1864. He participated in the Invasion of Waikato, being present at Rangiriri, Waiari, Paterangi, Rangiawhia, and at the siege and capture of Orakau. For his services during this period, he was Mentioned in Despatches, promoted to major on 28 June 1864, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in August 1866. In March 1867 Havelock was posted to Canada, where he served as assistant quartermaster-general for two years. He then spent three years in Dublin performing the same role. In 1870 he was given leave of absence to act as a War correspondent in the Franco-Prussian War, being present at the Battle of Sedan. In 1877, he attended the Russo-Turkish War in the same capacity. He was promoted to colonel on 17 June 1868, and major general on 18 March 1878. Ill health forced Havelock to retire from the active list on 9 December 1881, with the honorary rank of lieutenant general. However, when the Anglo-Egyptian War broke out the following year, he made his way to the British headquarters in Isma√Ølia telling a war correspondent: \\"Don't for goodness' sake mention me in your despatches, for my wife thinks I'm somewhere on the Riviera, but I could not resist coming here to see the fun.\\" He petitioned the British commander, Sir Garnet Wolseley, for a role on the staff; but Wolseley refused, writing to his wife: Nonetheless, Havelock was able to see action at the battles of Kassassin and Tel el-Kebir, where he supposedly led a charge armed with nothing but a riding crop.

This new union of fashion and astrophysics was described by the New York Times as \\"Zegna's Very Big Bang\\", and generated extensive worldwide publicity. \\"No one has ever done anything like this before\\", said Gildo Zegna. A new version of this video, which represents a collaboration between Terenzi, fellow astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Pilati, is entitled \\"City and Nature- Scientist Cut\\".

He was the only native of Northern Ireland to receive the Victoria Cross for Second World War service. Magennis was part of several operations involving X-Craft midget submarines in attacks on Axis ships. In July 1945 Magennis was serving on HMS XE3 during Operation Struggle. During an attack on the Japanese cruiser Takao in Singapore, Magennis showed extraordinary valour and bravery by leaving the submarine for a second time in order to free some explosive charges that had got caught. His commanding officer Lieutenant Ian Fraser was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 31 July 1945 during the operation. Early career James McGinnes was born on 27 October 1919 at Majorca Street, West Belfast, Ireland. He was from a working class Roman Catholic family and attended St Finian's Primary School on the Falls Road, Belfast until 3 June 1935 when enlisted in the Royal Navy as a boy seaman (spelling his surname Magennis). He served on several different warships between 1935 and 1942, when he joined the submarine branch. Before joining the submarine branch, Magennis served on the destroyer Kandahar which was mined off Tripoli, Libya, in December 1941 whilst Magennis was on board. The ship was irreparably damaged and was scuttled the following day.Ashcroft, Michael, p.287 In December 1942, Magennis was drafted into the Submarine service and in March 1943 he volunteered for \\"special and Hazardous duties\\" -- which meant Midget submarines, or X-craft. He trained as a diver, and in September 1943 took part in the first major use of the X-craft during Operation Source. Two submarines, HMS X7 and HMS X6, penetrated K√•fjord, Norway, and disabled the German battleship Tirpitz. For his part in the attack Magennis was mentioned in dispatches \\"[f]or bravery and devotion to duty\\" in 1943.  Operation Struggle  In July 1945, Magennis, as acting leading seaman, was serving as the diver on the midget submarine , under the command of Lieutenant Ian Fraser, as part of Operation Struggle.Ashcroft 2006, p. 288. They were tasked with sinking the 10,000 ton , the first of the . She was berthed in the Straits of Johor, Singapore, acting as an anti-aircraft battery. On 30 July, XE3 was towed to the area by the submarine . She slipped her tow at 23:00 for the forty-mile journey through hazardous wrecks, minefields and listening posts to reach the Takao. After arriving at the Takao at 13:00 on 31 July, Magennis slipped out of the wet-and-dry chamber and attached limpet mines to the Takao under particularly difficult circumstances. He had to chip away at barnacles on the bottom of the cruiser for 30 minutes, before being able to attach the limpets. During this time, his breathing apparatus was leaking and he returned to the submarine after completion of his task very exhausted. On withdrawing, Fraser found that one of the limpet carriers which was being jettisoned would not release itself. Magennis immediately volunteered to free it, commenting: \\"I'll be all right as soon as I've got my wind, Sir.\\"Ashcroft 2006, p. 289. This he did, after seven minutes of nerve-racking work with a heavy spanner. On completion, Magennis returned to XE3 for the second time, allowing the four man midget submarine to make its escape out to open sea to meet the waiting Stygian. Fraser was also awarded the Victoria Cross for his part in the attack; whilst Lieutenant William J. L. Smith, who was at the controls of XE3 during the attack, received the Distinguished Service Order.

XE1s commanding officer, Lieutenant John Elliott Smart, and Sub-Lieutenant Harold Edwin Harper, received the Distinguised Service Cross. Engineer fourth class Henry James Fishleigh and leading seaman Walter Henry Arthur Pomeroy received the Distinguished Service Medal. Engineer fourth class Albert Nairn, leading stoker Jack Gordan Robinson, and Able Seaman Ernest Raymond Dee were mentioned in dispatches for their part in bringing the two midget submarines from harbour to the point where the crews that took part in the attack took over. = Victoria Cross = The citation was published in a supplement to the London Gazette of 9 November: Later life Memorial to Leading Seaman Magennis VC Wall mural commemorating James Magennis Magennis was the only Victoria Cross recipient of the Second World War to hail from Northern Ireland. As a result, Magennis obtained something of a \\"celebrity status\\"Ashcroft, Michael, p.290 in his home city. The citizens of Belfast raised more than ¬£3,000 as part of a \\"Shilling Fund.\\" The City Fathers of Belfast refused to give Magennis the freedom of the City though. Sources differ as to the reasoning behind this; some claim it was due to religious divisions, others claim it was due to the City Fathers not \\"...believing that such an honour could not be bestowed on a working-class Catholic from the inner-city slums.\\" In 1946 Magennis married Edna Skidmore, with whom he had four sons. The money from the Shilling Fund was spent quickly by Magennis and his wife; she remarked: \\"We are simple people... forced into the limelight. We lived beyond our means because it seemed the right thing to do.\\" In 1949 he left the Navy and returned to Belfast, where, at some point, he sold his Victoria Cross . In 1955 he moved to Yorkshire, where he worked as an electrician. For the last years of his life, he suffered from chronic ill health, before dying on 11 February 1986 of lung cancer hours before his heroism was honoured by the Royal Navy Philatelic Office with a first-day cover. Memorials Magennis has had several memorials in his honour. However initial official recognition was only a photograph in the robing room of the Belfast city council chamber. The first memorial was erected in 1999 after a long campaign by his biographer George Fleming and Major S.H. Pollock CD (Canada). It, a bronze and stone statue, was officially unveiled in Belfast on 8 October 1999. The ceremony was conducted in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in the presence of Magennis's son Paul, by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Bob Stoker. Magennis's former commanding officer, Ian Fraser, was reported as saying: \\"Jim gave me bother from time to time. He liked his tot of rum, but he was a lovely man and a fine diver. I have never met a braver man. It was a privilege to know him and it's wonderful to see Belfast honour him at last.\\" A wall mural commemorating James Magennis on the 60th anniversary of VJ day was unveiled on 16 September 2005 by Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist Party Member of Parliament representing East Belfast, including Tullycarnet. =Magennis plaques= Royal Naval Association, Belfast In 1986 at a memorial service in Bradford Cathedral, the Submarine Old Comrade Association (West Riding Branch) erected a memorial plaque on an inner wall within the Cathedral. The plaque made of Welsh slate was supplied by ex-submariner Tommy Topham MBE. Rear Admiral Place VC, CB, CVO, DSC unveiled the plaque. In attendance was Petty Officer Tommy \\"Nat\\" Gould, another submariner Victoria Cross recipient of the Second World War. In 1998 a memorial plaque was installed by Castlereagh Borough Council on the wall of Magennis's former home at 32 Carncaver Road, Castlereagh, East Belfast. A memorial blue plaque sponsored by Belfast City Council was installed on the outer wall of the Royal Naval Association building at Great Victoria Street, Belfast by the Ulster History Circle. =Ashcroft collection= In 1986, there was some publicity in the newspapers that his VC would be up at auction. This attracted the interest of Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft who bought the VC for ¬£29,000 (plus fees) amidst strong competition from dealers and private collectors. This was the first Victoria Cross bought by Lord Ashcroft, who, as of 2006, owned 142 medals.Ashcroft, Michael, pp.19-21 In July 2008 Lord Ashcroft announced a donation of ¬£5 million for a permanent gallery at the Imperial War Museum, where Victoria Crosses already held by the museum will be put on display alongside his own.Never forget the winners of the Victoria Cross The Lord Ashcroft Gallery opened in 2010. In the media Magennis was profiled in the 2006 television docudrama Victoria Cross Heroes, which included archive footage, dramatisations of his actions and an interview with Lord Ashcroft about his VC.

He was decorated for his actions on Bougainville in July 1945, when he attacked two Japanese bunkers despite severe wounds. Partridge was the last and, at 20 years of age, the youngest Australian awarded the Victoria Cross in World War II. He later became a farmer and a television quiz champion, and unsuccessfully ran for political office shortly before his death in a car accident. Early life Frank John Partridge was born at Grafton, New South Wales, on 29 November 1924, to farmer Patrick James Partridge and his English- born wife Mary (n√©e Saggs). The youth was educated at Tewinga Public School until he left at 13 to work on the family's dairy and banana farm at Upper Newee Creek, near Macksville. World War II In December 1942, during World War II, Partridge was conscripted by the Australian Army. He served as a private in the 8th Battalion, a Militia unit formed in Victoria. In May 1944, the 8th Battalion was posted to New Guinea. In June 1945, the 8th Battalion was transferred to the Bougainville campaign, where it operated to contain Japanese forces on the Bonis Peninsula. It was here that Partridge performed a deed for which he received the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry that could be awarded to British Commonwealth forces. On 24 July, in one of the last actions of the campaign on Bougainville, two platoons of the 8th Battalion attacked a Japanese post, Base 5, near Ratsua. Partridge's section came under heavy machine-gun fire and suffered severe casualties, including a Bren gunner who was killed. Although wounded in the arm and leg, Partridge retrieved the Bren gun and began shooting at the nearest bunker while under fire himself. He then rushed forward armed with a grenade and a knife, silenced the Japanese machine-gun with his grenade, and killed the only living occupant of the bunker with his knife. Partridge attacked the second until loss of blood compelled him to halt. Later he re-joined the fight and remained in action while the platoon withdrew. Partridge was the last and the youngest Australian to be awarded the Victoria Cross in World War II. He was also the first Australian Militiaman to receive the award.Wigmore, The Dared Mightily, pp. 267‚Äì269 Later life King George VI at Victory Parade, June 1946 Partridge's grave marker Discharged from the army in October 1946, Partridge returned to the family farm. He lived with his father in a dirt- floored farmhouse, and in his spare time devoted himself to self-education, reading Encyclop√¶dia Britannica by the light of a kerosene lamp. He had an extraordinarily retentive memory and in 1962‚Äì63 he appeared as a contestant on the television quiz show, Pick a Box, compered by Bob Dyer, alongside contestants such as Barry Jones. His laconic manner appealed strongly to viewers. Partridge was one of only three contestants to win all forty boxes and his prizes were valued at more than ¬£12,000 (in excess of A$250,000 in present-day terms). He married Barbara Dunlop, a 31-year-old nurse from Turramurra in Sydney, in February 1963. The wedding received extensive media coverage. She remained in Sydney while Partridge built a new house at the farm. He drove to Sydney every weekend to see her. Later in 1963, Partridge sought Country Party pre-selection for the Australian House of Representatives seat of Cowper. His political views were widely regarded as extreme, and he was not selected. To supplement the income from his farm, Partridge also sold life insurance. Partridge was killed in a car accident in 1964, and was buried with full military honours in Macksville Cemetery. His wife and three-month- old son survived him. In 1989 a primary school at Nambucca Heads was named the Frank Partridge VC Public School.

Details After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, the 23 years old, and a temporary lieutenant in The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), British Army, was attached to 1/6th Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry during the First World War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 24 August 1918, and three days later, on 27 August near H√©nin and Fontaine-l√®s- Croisilles, France, Lieutenant Macintyre, when acting as adjutant of his battalion, was constantly in evidence in the firing line and by his coolness under most heavy shell and machine-gun fire inspired the confidence of all ranks. On one occasion when extra strong barbed wire entanglements were encountered, he organised and took forward a party and under heavy fire supervised the making of gaps. Subsequently, when relieved of command of the firing line and an enemy machine-gun opened fire close to him, he rushed it single-handed, putting the team to flight, and then brought in the gun. The full citation was published in a supplement to the London Gazette of 25 October 1918, and read: After the war, he entered the Civil Service in the Office of Works and by the time of his appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1949 New Year Honours, he was Under Secretary for Scotland in its successor, the Ministry of Works. He still held the post at his retirement in 1959. The medal is now on display in the National War Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle.

Mackey was one of twenty Australians to receive the award for actions during the Second World War, receiving his award posthumously for leading an attack on against a strongly defended Japanese position during the Battle of Tarakan in May 1945. He was 22 and serving as a corporal in the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion at the time of his death. Early life Born in Leichhardt, New South Wales, Mackey was the only son and the eldest of four children of Stanislaus Mackey, a baker, and his wife Bridget Catherine Smyth Mackey. After attending St. Columba's School in Leichhardt and the Christian Brothers' High School in Lewisham, New South Wales, the Mackey family moved to Portland, New South Wales, in 1936, where his father operated a bakery. Mackey finished his schooling at the age of 14 and began working for his father. However, he did not enjoy the work and his relationship with his father deteriorated. Second World War On 5 June 1940, Mackey enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, falsifying his age to do so. After training, he was posted to the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion and left with the unit in November 1941 for service in North Africa. He participated in the Syrian Campaign against the Vichy French and in the Second Battle of El Alamein. The Japanese threat to Australia grew as they advanced through the Pacific in 1942. In response, the Australian government requested the withdrawal of Australian units back to their home country, and Mackey's battalion returned in February 1943. It served in Papua New Guinea from August 1943 to March 1944, during which time Mackey was promoted to the rank of corporal. While in Papua, he suffered several bouts of malaria. After a period of rest and reorganisation in Australia, the battalion returned to the Southwest Pacific theatre of operations in April 1945 when they were committed to the Borneo Campaign. On 1 May 1945, Mackey's battalion, as part of 26th Brigade Group, landed at Lingkas Beach on Tarakan Island, off North Borneo. The island's airfield was to be captured to allow its use in operations against Borneo. Advancing inland along the Aman River, the battalion were held up by Japanese defending a stronghold known as Helen. On 12 May 1945, Mackey's company was to continue an attack that had begun three days previously and it was during this action that he earned the Victoria Cross (VC). The citation for his VC read: The Japanese continued to hold off the attacking pioneers for a further two days before Helen was bombed with napalm, forcing them to abandon the position. Originally buried where he was killed, after the war Mackey was interred at Labuan War Cemetery.CWGC record Mackey's VC was presented to his sister, Patricia, and was later donated to the Australian War Memorial, where it is now on display in the Hall of Valour.

Early life Donald John Dean was born on 19 April 1897 in Herne Hill, South London, to John H and Grace Dean. He was educated at Quernmore College. Military career =First World War= At the outbreak of war, Dean attempted to enlist but was rejected because he was under-age. He was able to become a special constable and also joined the Volunteer Training Corps, a part-time home defence force. When he turned 18 in April 1915, he attempted to enlist again at his local Territorial Force depot, this time successfully. (Chapter 1) Dean served as a private with the 28th London (Artists Rifles) Regiment in the Ypres Salient and during the Battle of the Somme. In October 1916 he was commissioned into the Royal West Kent Regiment and fought at Vimy Ridge and around Givenchy. He was 21 years old, and a Temporary Lieutenant in the 8th Battalion, The Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, when the following action took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 15 February 1919, Dean was presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V at Buckingham Palace and was given a civic reception in his home town of Sittingbourne.Crowdy 2010, Part II - Introduction =Interwar period= Following the war, Dean took up part-time soldiering with the Territorial Army, being appointed captain in the 4th Battalion, Royal East Kent Regiment (The Buffs) in July 1921. He became a major in 1930 and took command of the battalion in 1936 with the rank of lieutenant colonel. =Second World War= After mobilisation in 1939, Dean was informed by his divisional commander, Major General Edmund Osborne, that he was to be replaced by a regular officer as Osborne believed that Territorial officers were not efficient enough to command a battalion.Crowdy 2010, Chapter 7 Although bitterly disappointed, Dean agreed to accept the post of Group Commander of No. 5 Group, Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, despite never having heard of either the appointment or the corps. He arrived at the group's depot at Butlin's Clacton holiday camp in Essex in October 1939.Crowdy 2010, Chapter 8 Dean was the youngest officer in the group, and although there were some experienced reservists amongst the other ranks, the majority had volunteered to escape unemployment or were conscripts who had been graded as unfit for any other military duty. On deployment to France with the British Expeditionary Force, No. 5 Group were issued with one rifle between every four men and undertook labouring tasks in the Doullens area, near Amiens, without any opportunity for training. In May 1940, the group were threatened by the advancing Germans and were ordered to evacuate but were without transport. Dean therefore marched his men to Saint-Pol where they attempted to find a train. With the rail system in chaos, Dean resorted to bribing the station master so that he could requisition a train and following a brief fire-fight with the leading German units the Group were able to reach Wimereux near Boulogne-sur-Mer. Here Dean was ordered to send part of his force to Bolougne harbour to act as dock labour for 20th Guards Brigade who were arriving to defend the port. The Guards established a defensive perimeter around the town and were told to expect reinforcements from Calais, however these never arrived as the Germans had occupied the coast road. Therefore, Dean was asked to provide a force to fill a gap in the defences. Selecting 800 of his pioneers, Dean armed them with rifles taken from the remainder who were sent on to the harbour to begin evacuating to England. Lacking any heavy weapons, Dean directed the construction of roadblocks from whatever was available, which it was hoped might delay the advancing tanks.Thompson 2009, p. 174 On 23 May, the Germans attacked in earnest; in fierce fighting at their barricades, the pioneers claimed to have destroyed one tank by igniting petrol underneath it. The pioneers were the last unit to pull back from the perimeter, because the runner bringing the order to withdraw could not locate Dean since there were no radios.Thompson 2009, p. 178 Eventually arriving at the harbour, Dean ensured that as many of his men as possible were evacuated before being the last man to board the final destroyer to depart. Later he served in Madagascar and Italy, earning two Mentions in Despatches and a promotion to full colonel in 1945. He also served as a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent. Personal life In 1923, Dean married Marjorie Wood. They had one son and one daughter.

Thomas Peck Hunter VC (6 October 1923 ‚Äì 3 April 1945) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Background Thomas Hunter was born in Aldershot on 6 October 1923, one of five children of Ramsey and Mary Hunter (a former soldier and civil servant), who moved to Edinburgh shortly after his birth. Hunter attended Stenhouse Primary School and Tynecastle High School (where the poet Wilfred Owen had taught during recuperation in 1917) before becoming an apprentice stationer in Edinburgh. Hunter‚Äôs sister lives in Edinburgh and his nephew, John Swinney, is the Scottish finance secretary and Member of the Scottish Parliament. Military career At the outbreak of the war he served in the Home Guard and was called up on 8 May 1942 for military service. He enlisted as a hostilities‚Äìonly (HO) marine on 23 June 1942. He was promoted LCpl on 6 October 1943 and Temporary Cpl on 25 January 1945. =Victoria Cross= Hunter was 21 years old, and a temporary corporal in 43 (RM) Commando during the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy during the Second World War when the following incident took place. He was awarded the VC for his actions during Operation Roast. On 2 April 1945 at Lake Comacchio, Italy, Corporal Hunter, who was in charge of a Bren gun section, offered himself as a target to save his troop. Seizing the Bren gun, he charged alone across 200 yards of open ground under most intense fire towards a group of houses where three MG 42 machine-guns were lodged. So determined was his charge that the enemy soldiers were demoralized and six gunners surrendered. The remainder fled. Hunter cleared the house, changing magazines as he ran and continued to draw enemy fire until most of the troop had reached cover, Hunter was killed, firing accurately to the last. Danish national, Major Anders Lassen of the Special Boat Service (SBS) was also awarded a VC posthumously in the same action. Citation Cpl Thomas Hunter‚Äôs VC citation in the London Gazette of 12 June 1945 reads: ::ADMIRALTY. ::Whitehall 12 June 1945. ::The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the VICTORIA CROSS for valour to: ‚Äî ::The late Corporal (Temporary) Thomas Peck HUNTER, CH/X. 110296, Royal Marines (attached Special Service Troops) (43rd Royal Marine Commando) (Edinburgh). ::In Italy during the advance by the Commando to its final objective, Corporal Hunter of \\"C\\" Troop was in charge of a Bren group of the leading sub-section of the Commando. Having advanced to within 400 yards of the canal, he observed the enemy were holding a group of houses South of the canal. Realising that his Troop behind him were in the open, as the country there was completely devoid of cover, and that the enemy would cause heavy casualties as soon as they opened fire, Corporal Hunter seized the Bren gun and charged alone across two hundred yards of open ground. Three Spandaus from the houses, and at least six from the North bank of the canal opened fire and at the same time the enemy mortars started to fire at the Troop. ::Corporal Hunter attracted most of the fire, and so determined was his charge and his firing from the hip that the enemy in the houses became demoralised. Showing complete disregard for the intense enemy fire, he ran through the houses, changing magazines as he ran, and alone cleared the houses. Six Germans surrendered to him and the remainder fled across a footbridge onto the North bank of the canal. ::The Troop dashing up behind Corporal Hunter now became the target for all the Spandaus on the North of the canal. Again, offering himself as a target, he lay in full view of the enemy on a heap of rubble and fired at the concrete pillboxes on the other side. He again drew most of the fire, but by now the greater part of the Troop had made for the safety of the houses. During this period he shouted encouragement to the remainder, and called only for more Bren magazines with which he could engage the Spandaus. Firing with great accuracy up to the last, Corporal Hunter was finally hit in the head by a burst of Spandau fire and killed instantly. ::There can be no doubt that Corporal Hunter offered himself as a target in order to save his Troop, and only the speed of his movement prevented him being hit earlier. The skill and accuracy with which he used his Bren gun is proved by the way he demoralised the enemy, and later did definitely silence many of the Spandaus firing on his Troop as they crossed open ground, so much so that under his covering fire elements of the Troop made their final objective before he was killed. ::Throughout the operation his magnificent courage, leadership and cheerfulness had been an inspiration to his comrades. King George VI presented his VC to his parents at a private investiture on 26 September 1945 at Holyrood House. In September 1974 the medal was donated by his sister and nephew to the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, where all 10 Royal Marines VCs are securely stored, the medal on display there being a copy.

The idea was initially conceived by Walter Kaiser, former professor of English and Comparative Literature at Harvard and director of the Villa I Tatti. Its goal is to be the Italian Renaissance version of the Loeb Classical Library. James Hankins, Professor of History at Harvard University, is the General Editor. Many of the books in the series have never been translated into English before, and the series promises to increase the understanding of the Renaissance among the general public and non-specialist historians by making primary sources accessible, thus giving a window into the minds of Renaissance thinkers themselves. The books of The I Tatti Renaissance Library have a consistent appearance: a pale blue cover, analogous to the red (Latin) or green (Greek) books in the Loeb Classical Library. They are, however, closer in size to a standard hardcover book than to the pocket-sized books of the Loeb series. A typeface named \\"ITRL\\", based on the work of Renaissance typographer Nicolas Jenson, was specially designed for the series. The books are notable for their overall readability.

Built in 1907, the 1,244-seat Royal Alex is the oldest continuously operating legitimate theatre in North America. History The Royal Alex is a 1,244-seat, beaux-arts style, proscenium-stage theatre, with two balcony levels, built in the style typical of 19th century British theatres. Construction began in 1905 and was completed in 1907. Since 1963 it has been owned by Ed Mirvish Enterprises, a company established by Toronto department store owner Edwin Mirvish. Since 1986, the theatre has been managed and operated by Mirvish Productions, the theatre production company headed by Ed's son, David Mirvish. The theatre, commonly known as the \\"Royal Alex\\", \\"the Alex\\" or \\"the R.A.T.\\" is named for Queen Alexandra, a Danish princess and the wife of King Edward VII, great- grandmother to the current Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II. The theatre received letters patent from Edward VII entitling it to the royal designation. Its present owners believe that it is the only remaining legally \\"royal theatre\\" in North America. At the time of its opening, the Royal Alex was in an upscale neighbourhood. The mansion of Ontario's lieutenant-governor was nearby, the Ontario legislative buildings had been there until 1893, the upper-class St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church and the Princess Theatre, Toronto's finest \\"first-class\\" showplace were also in the vicinity. The theatre was built on what had previously been the athletic field of the exclusive boys' school Upper Canada College near the corner of King and Simcoe streets. This intersection was then known as \\"the crossroads of Education, Legislation, Salvation and Damnation\\" - \\"Education\\" for Upper Canada College; \\"Legislation\\" for the parliament buildings; \\"Salvation\\" for St. Andrew's; and \\"Damnation\\" for a tavern, popular with actors from the Princess Theatre, that then stood on the northeast corner of the crossroads. The construction of the Royal Alex was financed by a group of business leaders who sought to \\"put Toronto on the map\\" as a place of culture and refinement. The principal of this group was Cawthra Mulock, a 21-year-old foundry owner, scion of two of Ontario's most prominent families (the Cawthras and the Mulocks) who lived a short walk east of site in a large home called \\"Cawthra House\\", locally famed for its doorknobs of solid gold. Other members of the syndicate included Robert Alexander Smith, Stephen Haas, and Lawrence \\"Lol\\" Solman. Solman would manage the theatre from 1907 until his death in 1931. The architect chosen by Mulock and his group was the young John McIntosh Lyle, born in Belfast, reared in Hamilton, Ontario, and educated at Yale University and Paris' √âcole des Beaux- Arts. Lyle was an associate with the New York architectural firm Carr√®re and Hastings, the official architects of the theatre. Mulock gave Lyle a budget of $750,000 and the simple instruction \\"Build me the finest theatre on the continent.\\" He also, however, insisted that the theatre be built on a steel frame, as a demonstration of the products of his foundry. Lyle greatly overspent his budget, but delivered a structure described in later years as \\"an Edwardian jewel-box.\\" The interior featured an Italian marble lobby; Venetian mosaic floors; elaborately carved walnut and cherrywood stairs and railings; silk wallpapers; ornate, gilded plasterwork; and an enormous sounding-board mural (\\"Venus and Attendants Discover the Sleeping Adonis\\") by the popular Canadian painter Frederick S. Challener. Lyle also incorporated a number of \\"firsts\\" into his design: the Alex was North America's first air- conditioned theatre (by virtue of a large ice-pit under the orchestra), one of its first \\"fireproof\\" theatres, and the first on the continent (thanks to the steel framing) to employ cantilevered balconies, with no internal pillars to interfere with lines of sight. The theatre opened on August 26, 1907. Its first presentation was a pantomime \\"spectacle\\" titled \\"Top O'Th' World\\", starring Anna Laughlin, heading a cast of 65. During its early years, the Royal Alex had great difficulty in booking acts for its stage. The theatre owners found themselves at odds with the powerful Theatrical Syndicate, the New York-based organisation headed by Charles Frohman, Al Hayman, Abe Erlanger, Mark Klaw, Samuel F. Nixon and Fred Zimmerman that not only exercised a near monopoly on touring theatre in North America, but also had a financial interest in the rival Princess Theatre, two blocks east of the Royal Alexandra. The manager of the Alex, Lawrence \\"Lol\\" Solman, allied his theatre with the Syndicate's chief challengers, the Shubert brothers. For this impertinence, Solman later wrote, Abe Erlanger threatened to drive the Alex into bankruptcy and turn it into a stable for the horses of the carriage-trade patrons of the Princess. Royal Alexandra Theatre in 1930. Normally a legitimate theatre, on this occasion the Royal Alex was showing a talking picture, then still quite a novelty. The local rivalry with the Princess Theatre ended on the night of May 7, 1915, when a fire gutted that theatre, leaving the Royal Alex as Toronto's only first-class, legitimate playhouse. By coincidence, on that same evening, the British liner sank in the Irish Sea after being struck by a torpedo. One of those killed in the disaster was Syndicate partner and creative head Charles Frohman. Over the 1940s and '50s, the Royal Alex declined - as did so many regional theatres, unable to compete with cinema, radio and television - into hard times. The neighbourhood surrounding the theatre also went into decline, becoming dominated by railway marshalling yards, warehouses and light industry. In 1962, after a decade of money-losing operation, the trustees of the Mulock estate (Cawthra Mulock died during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918) put the theatre up for sale. The property was purchased by Ed Mirvish in 1963, owner of the Toronto discount shop Honest Ed's for the sum of $250,000. Mirvish said at the time that he knew nothing about theatre‚Äîhad never even been inside a theatre‚Äîbut knew a bargain when he saw one. As a condition of the sale, Ed Mirvish pledged to continue operating the Royal Alex as a legitimate theatre for at least five years. If, at the end of that time, he was unwilling to continue, he was then permitted to demolish the building and use the site for other purposes. Mirvish closed the theatre for one year - the longest it had ever been dark - for renovation and restoration. The Royal Alex re-opened in September, 1963, with the comedy \\"Never Too Late\\", starring William Bendix and produced by Ed Mirvish. Ed Mirvish rarely after ventured into production, but used the theatre - as it had always been used - as a road house, booking in touring shows and pre-Broadway tryouts. He also allowed the theatre to be used by local companies - including the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada - and made the Alex the home, for many years, of the popular annual Toronto revue \\"Spring Thaw\\". He did, however, achieve notable success as a producer with Hair in 1970, and Godspell in 1972. The latter starred a group of young Canadian unknowns who would go on to great success, including Victor Garber, Gilda Radner, Martin Short, Eugene Levy and Andrea Martin. Following the renovation of the Royal Alex, Mirvish purchased, one by one, the warehouse and industrial buildings along King St. to the west of the theatre. In these, he opened a group of colourful restaurants‚Äîincluding Ed's Warehouse, Ed's Folly and Old Ed's‚Äîin a successful effort to draw people back into the neighbourhood. The last of these restaurants closed in 2000 by which point the area around the Royal Alex had been transformed from abandoned warehouses into a district of independent winebars, restaurants, cafes and bistros.

In 1975, Toronto City Council recognized the historic value of the theatre by designating it under the Ontario Heritage Act by By-law 512-75.260 King Street West, Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties In 1987, on the 80th anniversary of the theatre, it was designated a National Historic Site of Canada.Royal Alexandra Theatre, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaRoyal Alexandra Theatre, National Register of Historic Places Ed Mirvish and his son David Mirvish, added a second theatre to the family interests in 1982, when they purchased and restored London, England's historic Old Vic. In 1986, David Mirvish created the company Mirvish Productions to produce original, \\"sit- down\\" plays and musicals for the Royal Alexandra. Ed Mirvish retired from active participation in the theatres in 1987, handing the business to his son. In 1993, David Mirvish added a third theatre to the empire, building the Princess of Wales Theatre a block to the west of the Royal Alexandra. The Princess was named, in part, in memory of the old Princess, rival to the Alex in the early years of the 20th century. The theatre's managers have been Lawrence Solman 1907-1931, William Breen 1933-1939, Ernest Rawley 1939-1963, Edwin De Rocher 1963-1969, Yale Simpson 1969-1989, Graham Hall 1989-1994, Ron Jacobson 1994‚Äìpresent. = 2016 renovation = The Royal Alex in September 2016. On May 15, 2016, following the conclusion of Kinky Bootss run at the theatre, the Royal Alexandra closed to undergo a $2.5 million renovation. David Mirvish explained that the renovation was intended to \\"once more restore and give life to that sparkle and give a level of comfort that will preserve the theatre as our flagship of the 21st century\\". The most significant change was the refurbishment of its seating areas to improve audience comfort, with the replacement of its original seats with modern versions that are larger and arranged to increase legroom. The new seating layout necessitated a reduction in capacity from 1,497 to 1,244; David contrasted it to the trend of theatres increasing their capacity to \\"maximize\\" revenue, arguing that the improved amenities would build improve customer loyalty and encourage repeat visits. The theatre re-opened on November 15, 2016 with the opening of Come from Away; the pre-Broadway run for the show set sales records for the Royal Alex, selling out its entire run within only its second week of shows, and $1.7 million worth of tickets in a week.

Early life and education Meynell was the son of an army officer and won a scholarship to Eton College. He was commended to Cyril Connolly when he arrived there as a boy with character. After an initial amount of bullying, the two became firm friends as described in Enemies of Promise.Cyril Connolly Enemies of Promise Routledge & Kegan Paul 1938 Military career Meynell had passed out 13th at Sandhurst before he volunteered for the British Indian Army. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1933 for his work in Chitral.London Gazette =Victoria Cross= Meynell was thirty-one years old, and a captain in the 5th Battalion (Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides), 12th Frontier Force Regiment during the 1935 Mohmand Campaign in British India. On 29 September 1935 at Mohmand, in the Nahaqi Pass within the Khyber Pass on the North West Frontier, in the final phase of an attack, Captain Meynell, seeking information on the most forward troops, found them involved in a struggle against an enemy vastly superior in numbers. He at once took command, and with two Lewis guns and about thirty men, maintained a heavy and accurate fire on the advancing enemy, whose overwhelming numbers nevertheless succeeded in reaching the position and putting the Lewis guns out of action. In the hand-to-hand struggle which ensued, Captain Meynell was mortally wounded, but the heavy casualties inflicted on the enemy prevented them from exploiting their success. Regimental records suggest that when the bodies of his men were mutilated by the enemy (as was their custom), Captain Meynell sought to defend those bodies even as he himself was dying. Captain Meynell and his wife, Sophia Patricia (Jill) Meynell, were both speakers of Urdu. His body is laid to rest at the Guides Chapel in Mardan, near Peshawar in the North West Frontier Province (of what is now Pakistan), where he and his wife Sophia Patricia (but known as Jill) n√©e Lowis were married. According to shipping records, his widow returned to England with their eldest son accompanied by her twin brother (and his brother officer) Jack Lowis and they arrived in England after a 10 day sea journey at the end of October, within one month of Godfrey Meynell VC MC's death. Three months after he was killed, news of the award of the VC arrived at Meynell Langley on 24 December 1935. Three months later their 2nd son, Hugo Anthony Meynell, was born on 24 March 1936 and less than three months later his widow Jill (Sophia Patricia n√©e Lowis) received the VC at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 14 July 1936, the only one to be handed out by Edward VIII.

Gnav is a traditional game that is played with either cards or wooden pieces. Related games are Cucc√π, Hexenspiel, Gnaio, Vogelspiel, Cambio (also Campio, Camphio, Camfio, or Kamfio), and Kille. The game can be played by 20 or more players, and a minimum of two.  History of the game  Swedish Kille deck from 1897. The earliest reference to the game dates to 1490 France where it was known by the name of M√©content (Malcontent) and was played with a standard 52-card deck. Such a game is still played today in France as Coucou (\\"cuckoo\\") and also in English speaking countries as Cuckoo or Ranter-Go- Round. The earliest reference of Malcontento in Italy dates from 1547 (‚ÄúCapriccio in laude del Malcontento‚Äù by Luigi Tansillo of Naples). It was in the early 18th century that the first dedicated decks for Cuccu (or Cucco, or Cucu‚Äô, or Stu) appeared which consisted of 38 cards. The oldest known written regulation dates back to 1717 by the Al Mondo company. It was included in the deck of cards produced in Bologna by Giulio Borzaghi. In a title card of another pack, the cards were described as a new game with the Fool. As in the original card game, suits do not matter but rank is very important. The new deck reduced the cards to two identical sequences but added more ranks. The most unusual feature about the new deck was the inclusion of the Fool cards which are unranked. This may have been inspired by the Fool from tarocchi games where they are also unranked. The game was also known to be played with wooden pieces in Venice during the late 18th-century, possibly as a way of avoiding the stamp tax. As the game migrated north through Europe in the 18th century the number of cards and the name of the game changed. In Germany, Bavaria, and Austria, for example, it became Hexenspiel (\\"the Witch game\\") and Vogelspiel (\\"The Bird game\\").Roger Tilley A history of playing cards pg. 192 C. N. Potter (1973) By the time that it reached Denmark as Gniao (the miaowing of a cat -- \\"miao\\" in Italian), it had 42 cards. This then became Gnav when the game was brought to Norway during the union with Denmark. Gnav was brought to the Netherlands where it became known as Slabberjan. The game is first mentioned in Sweden in 1741, as Cambio (Italian for \\"exchange\\"). In 1833 this became Kille (probably a distortion of \\"Harlequin\\", given the special rules for the Harlequin card in the Swedish version of the game), which became the common form of the game around 1850.Hugo Kastner Die gro√üe Humboldt-enzyklop√§die der Kartenspiele pg. 30 Humboldt (2205)  Rules  Each player receives a single card (or wooden piece) at random, and examines its value. If a player is dealt the Fool, they must knock the table to alert other players to this fact. Players also receive equal supplies of tokens. Play then proceeds by turns, starting to the left of the dealer. Each turn, a player may either choose to keep their card (saying \\"jeg st√•r\\"), or to swap it with their left-hand neighbor (\\"jeg byte\\"). Play continues until reaching the dealer, who has the choice of keeping their card or swapping it with the top card of the deck, drawing another card if a Horse or House is drawn. Once the dealer has had their turn, the round ends. If a player attempts to swap their card with one of the five highest cards in the game (picture cards known as matadors), the swap is prevented and another action happens in its place, depending on the matador card held by their opponent: * Cuckoo: the holder says \\"stop, cuckoo\\" and the round ends immediately. * Dragoon: the holder says \\"cut off\\" (\\"hugg av\\"), and the player who tried to swap cards must pay a token to the pool. Play then proceeds with the player to the holder's left. * Cat: the holder says \\"miaow\\" or \\"sst, change back\\" (\\"kiss, bytt om\\"), the player who tried to swap cards must pay a token to the pool, and the game is reset so that every player has the card they started with. * Horse or House: the holder says \\"pass the horse\\" (\\"hest vorbi\\") or \\"pass the house\\" (\\"hus vorbi\\"), and the player who tried to swap cards must instead swap with the player to the left of the holder (or with the top card of the deck, if the holder is also the dealer). When the round ends, all players reveal their cards and the player with the lowest value loses the round. (If two players are tied, they both lose.) If the lowest value card was the Fool, then both the Fool's holder and the next lowest player lose. A losing player pays one token to the pool, and is eliminated if they have no tokens left. The last player remaining is the winner.  Sets  = Gnav = The wooden pieces, in the piece version of the game, resemble the pawns in chess, with the identity of the piece being written on the base and thus invisible during play.

He was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in 1854 during the Crimean War. However, in 1872 he ruined his career when he put his battleship aground at Pantellaria, resulting in his dismissal from his ship; he was never employed at sea again.  Early life  John Bythesea was born on 15 June 1827 in Freshford, Somerset, the son of Rev. George Bythesea. He entered the Royal Navy in 1841, and was promoted to lieutenant on 12 June 1849. On 22 June 1850, he was posted to the 46-gun screw-frigate commanded by Captain Robert Spencer Robinson, Lisbon. He stayed with Arrogant when she was recommissioned at Portsmouth by Captain Stephen Greville Fremantle on 27 September 1852. Fremantle was succeeded by Captain Hastings Yelverton on 24 October 1853. She served in the Baltic Sea in 1854 in the Crimean War. Action for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross On 9 August 1854 in the Baltic, Lieutenant Bythesea obtained permission to land on the island of V√•rd√∂, √Öland Islands off Finland with a Swedish-speaking crewman Stoker William Johnstone, to intercept important despatches from the Czar which were being sent via V√•rd√∂ to Bomarsund. \\"They lay in wait for three days until five Russians arrived on 12 August with the postbags. Johnstone ambushed the men, at Bythesea's signal, attempting to throw a rope around the group whilst Bythesea provided cover with just one pistol. Two of the men dropped their bags and fled while the remaining three finally surrendered. Bythesea ordered the men back to their own boat and then forced them to row it back to Arrogant, with the mailbags.\\"British Embassy Helsinki ‚Äì Bomarsund page . Another account is given on Location of grave and VC medal (Avon) Career up to Lord Clyde On 12 March 1855, Lieutenant Bythesea was appointed captain of the paddle gun-vessel and served in the Flying Squadron in the Baltic. On 10 May 1856 he was promoted to commander, and on 20 May, Lieutenant John Bousquet Field replaced him as captain of Locust. On 4 March 1858 he took over as captain of the 17-gun screw-sloop (also spelled Cruiser) from Charles Fellowes. At the time, Cruizer was serving in the Far East and saw action in the 2nd Anglo-Chinese War. Cruizer paid off at Portsmouth on 1 May 1861. On 15 May 1861, he was promoted to captain. In 1862, he served on the Commission to examine Canadian defences. On 30 March 1863 he commissioned the 12-gun screw- corvette at Woolwich. Archer served on the West Africa Station. Bythesea was invalided out, and replaced by Captain Francis Marten on 12 April 1864. From 1 April 1866 until 1867, he was carried on the books of the flagship of the North American Squadron, HMS Duncan, for special service as Naval Attache in Washington, D.C. From 6 May 1867 until 29 November 1870 he was captain of the screw-frigate . Bythesea commanded her for the entire commission. She served first in the Channel squadron, then the West Indies, then joining the flying squadron at Bahia on 4 August 1869. Loss of HMS Lord Clyde On 14 September 1871 he commissioned the battleship at Plymouth and took her out to the Mediterranean Fleet. In March 1872, Lord Clyde: : \\"was lying at Syracuse and received a wire from Malta to proceed at once to the help of a British steamer aground on the island of Pantellaria, on which service she got far worst aground herself. Anchors were laid out, coal jettisoned, guns, ammunition and stores hoisted over the side into small casters in the island hired on the spot, and everything possible done to lighten her, but she remained a fixture except to sway in the swell from the open sea, strain her back, and wrench off her sternpost, rudderpost and rudder. It took some time to summon help, as that was a full generation before the days of wireless telegraphy and Pantellaria had no cables; but an officer was dispatched by a passing steamer to Malta, where the was lying as flagship and came at once to pull her crippled sister off the floor and get her to bed. This proved an extremely difficult job even when she was afloat again, as she yawed about so violently without a rudder when in tow, as to pull the sister in charge all over the place. It took three days to conduct erring footsteps a distance that could ordinarily be covered in less than one, and all the while she was leaking at a steady rate of 2 feet per hour. On arrival at Malta she had to be docked with great care on account of the badly damaged state of her bottom; and the yard reported that it would take six months to repair.\\"Ballard The Black Battlefleet p 84. The court-martial in April 1872 severely reprimanded Bythesea and the Navigating Officer, who were dismissed from their ship and neither of them were ever employed at sea again. Lord Clyde was never commissioned again. Marriage and retirement Bythesea married Fanny Belinda Prior in 1874, His turn for promotion to the rank of Rear-Admiral came on 5 August 1877 but, because he did not have the requisite six years' sea time as a Captain, he was placed on the Retired List with the rank of Rear-Admiral. He served as consulting naval officer to the Indian Government from 1874, until the Indian Navy was restructured in 1880. He was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) and a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1878. He died at South Kensington on 18 May 1906 and was buried at Bath Abbey Cemetery, Somerset.

The song was composed by Pickett and Steve Cropper at the historic Lorraine Motel in Memphis, later (April 1968) the site of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. Pickett's first hit on Atlantic Records, it reached number one on the R&B; charts and peaked at number 21 on the pop charts. In 2017, the song was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or artistically significant.\\" Composition and recording Wilson Pickett recorded \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" at Stax Studios, Memphis, May 12, 1965. The song's co-writer Steve Cropper recalls: \\"[Atlantic Records president] Jerry Wexler said he was going to bring down this great singer Wilson Pickett\\" to record at Stax Studio where Cropper was a session guitarist \\"and I didn‚Äôt know what groups he'd been in or whatever. But I used to work in [a] record shop, and I found some gospel songs that Wilson Pickett had sung on. On a couple [at] the end, he goes: 'I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour! Oh, in the midnight hour. I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour.'\\" and Cropper got the idea of using the phrase \\"in the midnight hour\\" as the basis for an R&B; song. More likely, Cropper was remembering the Falcon's 1962 song \\"I Found a Love,\\" on which Pickett sings lead and says \\"And sometimes I call in the midnight hour!\\" The only gospel record Pickett had appeared on before this was the Violinaires' \\"Sign of the Judgement,\\" which includes no such phrase. Besides Cropper the band on \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" featured Stax session regulars Al Jackson (drums) and Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn (bass). According to Cropper, \\"Wexler was responsible for the track's innovative delayed backbeat\\", as Cropper revamped his planned groove for \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" based on a dance step called the Jerk, which Wexler demonstrated in the studio - \\"(quote Cropper) this was the way the kids were dancing; they were putting the accent on two. Basically, we'd been one-beat- accenters with an afterbeat; it was like 'boom dah,' but here was a thing that went 'um-chaw,' just the reverse as far as the accent goes.\\" Charts and recognition \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" reached number one on the R&B; chart in Billboard magazine dated August 7, 1965 and crossed over to the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 reaching number 21: however according to Stax owner Jim Stewart the domestic sales total of the single in its original release was a moderate 300,000 units. One of the reasons, why the song failed to crack the top 20, was the fact that the song's title was too suggestive of sexuality in the after hours. However \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" by Wilson Pickett has become an iconic R&B; track, placing at number 134 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All-Time, Wilson Pickett's first of two entries on the list (the other being \\"Mustang Sally\\" at number 434). It is also one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, Pickett's only such entry. The song is currently ranked as the 175th greatest song of all time, as well as the eleventh best song of 1965, by Acclaimed Music. Pickett re-recorded the song for his 1987 album American Soul Man. Cover versions * The Young Rascals recorded the song in 1966. it was featured on the Rascals greatest hits album \\"Time Peace\\" (1968) *The Mirettes had a top 20 R&B; hit with their version of \\"In the Midnight Hour\\" which reached number 18 on the Billboard R&B; chart in March 1968, and number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Ren√© Auguste Constantin de Renneville (October 9, 1650 - March 13, 1723), was a French writer. He was born in Caen. Because of his Protestant principles, Renneville left France for the Netherlands in 1699. On his return three years later he was denounced as a spy and imprisoned in the Bastille, where he remained until 1713. During his imprisonment he wrote a series of poems on the margins of a copy of Auteurs d√©guis√©s (Paris, 1690), which he called Otia bastiliaca. These were rediscovered by James Tregaskis in 1906. Renneville was freed through the intercession of Queen Anne, and made his way to England. There he wrote his Histoire de la Bastille published in 1715 (volume 1) and 1719 (volumes 1-4 with a new preface) in Amsterdam with √âtienne Roger, a publisher who addressed the European market. The publication was dedicated to George I and appeared simultaneously in an abridged English and an illustrated German edition.The German edition is said to have appeared in Nuremberg so Zedler's Universal-Lexicon, vol. 31, col. 608. A Dutch edition followed in 1717. At the time of his death in 1723 he was a major of artillery in the service of the elector of Hesse. His other important work is a Recueil des voyages qui ont servi a l'√©tablissement de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales aux Provinces Unies (10 vols, new ed., Rouen, 1725). The English version of L'inquisition Fran√ßoise is of greater interest as it was published with William Taylor, the publisher Daniel Defoe chose for his Robinson Crusoe in 1719. Both titles eventually shared aspects of realism and romanticization, an interest in the hardly credible \\"romantic\\" story of a survivor.

ResNet may also refer to the department that administers such a network or the services provided via the network. A ResNet usually allows students to connect to a university's intranet with (possibly limited) access to the public Internet. ResNet is essentially the ISP for students residing in campus-managed housing.  Administration  The department, organization, or group responsible for maintenance of and support for the residential computer network is often also known as ResNet. This group may be an independent department in the central Information Technology division, the Housing department, or some other division or department. ResNet responsibilities may also lie not with a group dedicated to ResNet but may be one of many responsibilities such as those commonly held by help desks.  Services  The functions of such a department vary greatly between campuses. Most, at least, provide assistance in connecting to the school's network. Other services may include the removal of viruses, adware, spyware, greyware, and malware, as well as services ranging from operating system or software and hardware advice to data recovery. ResNet is slowly evolving into a full-blown computer Help Desk on many campuses, and in some cases has merged into a single support group for staff, faculty, and students. Some ResNet organizations have branched from computer only support to alternate devices such as smartphones, PDAs, and gaming devices.  The ResNet organization  Conceived in 1992, ResNet is an international organization providing a forum for discussion, collaboration, and development for IT professionals in higher education. Students, faculty, staff, and vendors participate in ResNet both through the ResNet Listserv and by attending the annual Student Technology Conference. The ResNet organization is dedicated to the research and advancement of student technologies and services and their use in higher education. The organization oversees the annual Student Technology Conference (and a related Professional Development Seminar), hosted by a member school. The ResNet organization has evolved from its simple roots during an informal discussion at Educom, into an internationally recognized professional organization engaging in dialogue, collaboration with vendors and other professional organizations, and professional development. Via its research entity, the ResNet Applied Research Group (RARG), ResNet has contributed to the international higher education community by conducting and publishing original research on networking technologies, music and entertainment, security, and technology support. The annual Student Technology Conference is held on the campus of a selected host institution. Among the institutions that have hosted the symposium are Stanford University, which hosted the first ResNet Symposium in 1994, Wellesley College, Kent State University, Ferris State University, Princeton University and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The Student Technology Conference is the only conference of its kind which deals exclusively with student technologies within academic institutions. Content in recent conferences has focused on collaboration between these living and learning environments, institutional academic offerings, and the future directions of technology and services. Many aspects of such services are addressed through case studies, topic presentations, focus group dialog, birds of a feather discussions, vendor participation, etc. For ResNet 2000, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, a Pre-Conference Tutorial Content (PTC) was created to offer attendees a seminar style format that offered greater depth on topics. The PCT has since evolved into the Professional Development Seminar (PDS). The PDS offers attendees sessions on management of technical staff, staff development, advanced Malware detection and removal, and IT leadership.

It is congruent with the administrative district (Bezirk) of Lienz.  History  The area around the former Roman municipium of Aguntum was from the 12th century held by the Counts of Gorizia, who took their residence at Lienz and inherited the County of Tyrol in 1253. While Tyrol was lost to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1363, the Gorizian counts retained Lienz until the extinction of the line in 1500. Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg finally incorporated it into Austrian Tyrol. East Tyrol's present-day situation arose from the defeat of the Austro- Hungarian Empire in World War I and its subsequent dissolution. By the 1915 Treaty of London, the Kingdom of Italy, which had joined the victorious Triple Entente, was to obtain the Tyrolean lands south of the Brenner Pass as claimed by the Italian irredentism movement. In November 1918 the Italian Army occupied all Tyrol with 20,000-22,000 soldiers. Thus under the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the rump state of German Austria had to cede to Italy the southern part of the former crown land of the Princely County of Tyrol, i.e. the present-day provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol and parts of the Belluno province. After the Austrian Anschluss in 1938 East Tyrol became part of the Reichsgau K√§rnten (Carinthia). It was returned to the Tyrol in 1947. After World War II East Tyrol became part of the British occupied zone of Austria. In Austria, East Tyrol borders the states of Carinthia in the east and Salzburg in the north, while it also shares borders with the Italian provinces of South Tyrol (Alto Adige, northern part of the region Trentino- Alto Adige) in the west and Belluno (the region Veneto) in the south. It is separated from the Tyrolean district of Schwaz in North Tyrol by a long common border of South Tyrol with the Salzburg Pinzgau region.  Attractions  The High Tauern National Park is in East Tyrol, along with several mountains including the Gro√üglockner (Austria's highest mountain, 3798 m), and Gro√üvenediger.

The lyrics describe the effects of heroin addiction on musicians Young knew, including his friend and Crazy Horse bandmate Danny Whitten, who would die of an overdose the same year the song was released. The song would preview the theme of Young's 1975 album Tonight's the Night, which would reflect on the fatal heroin overdoses of Whitten and Bruce Berry, a roadie for Young and Crazy Horse.  Young version  \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" was first released on Young's 1972 album Harvest. Rather than re- recording it, Young selected a live version from January 1971 that featured him singing and playing acoustic guitar. It would appear on the compilation albums Decade in 1977 and Greatest Hits in 2004. On the handwritten liner notes for Decade, Young wrote of the song: \\"I am not a preacher, but drugs killed a lot of great men.\\" Young performed the song in a 2005 Nashville concert, with the version being included on Jonathan Demme's 2006 documentary Neil Young: Heart of Gold. The documentary's DVD includes Young's 1971 performance of the song from The Johnny Cash Show. The song also appears on the 2007 album Live at Massey Hall 1971. At the January 19, 1971 concert featured on the live album, Young presented \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" with the following introduction: > Ever since I left Canada about five years ago or so and moved down south, I > found out a lot of things that I didn't know when I left. Some of 'em are > good, and some of 'em are bad. Got to see a lot of great musicians before > they happened, before they became famous, y'know, when they were just > gigging, five and six sets a night... things like that. And I got to see a > lot of great musicians who nobody ever got to see for one reason or another. > But, strangely enough, the real good ones that you never got to see was... > 'cause of heroin. And that started happening over and over. Then it happened > to someone that everyone knew about. So I just wrote a little song.

Wanli is a popular tourist destination and the site of the Cape Yeliu Miocene Formation which features distinctive hoodoo outcrops. The \\"Queen's Head\\" outcrop is a Taiwanese icon and serves as an informal trademark for the township. Kataw in the adjacent Jinshan District features the Wanli Taiwanese hot springs area, which is connected with the Jinshan Hot Springs (ÈáëÂ±±Ê∫´Ê≥â). History The village of Masu (Áë™Èãâ) was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines before the era of European colonization. The area first came under the control of the Spanish, who were then ousted by the Dutch. The area began to develop when Hoklo people came to set up fishing operations. The Ming dynasty loyalist Koxinga landed his troops at Wanli in 1661 to expel the Dutch from their northern strongholds while their principal fortress in Tainan was under siege. In 1683, following the Qing dynasty conquest of Taiwan, the area was incorporated into Zhuluo County. In 1875, it was a member of Kimpauli (ÈáëÂåÖÈáåÂ†°), Kelung Sub-Subprefecture (Âü∫ÈöÜÊîØÂª≥). In 1891, during Qing dynasty rule, the village was destroyed by military force as punishment for engaging in raids against Chinese camphor men and soldiers near Tokoham (modern-day Daxi). When the Japanese took control of the island in 1895, Wanli (called Banri by the Japanese) became part of Kƒ´run Subprefecture, Taihoku Ken. In 1901, a reorganisation split Taihoku Ken up into smaller prefectures, with Banri becoming part of Kinpori (Kimpauli) Subprefecture, . In 1909, Kƒ´run Prefecture was amalgamated into the larger . This situation remained in place until the China took over administration of Taiwan at the end of World War II: Taihoku Prefecture became Taipei County, and Banri Village became Wanli Township. Geography Wanli is bordered to the northwest by Jinshan District, to the northeast by the Pacific Ocean, to the east by the Anle and Qidu Districts of Keelung. To the south is a short border with Xizhi District of New Taipei City, and to the southwest is Taipei City's Shilin District. The topography of the area is marked by the rocky Pacific coastline and the forested, mountainous interior. Administration Since 25 December 2010 Wanli has been administered as the Wanli District of New Taipei City. Prior to this date it had been the Wanli Township of Taipei County. Wanli is further subdivided into ten villages; Wanli (), Beiji (), Guihou (), Yehliu (), Dapeng (), Huangtan (), Shuangxing (), Xidi (), Kanjiao (), and Zhongfu (). Prior to the 2010 reorganisation Wanli elected its own mayor, but now as a district of New Taipei City the District Chief is appointed by the mayor of New Taipei City. Economy The crabbing industry is important, and in 2012 the government established the Wanli Crab brand name to boost sales.

In the 1990s she became known for her work in Old Navy commercials where she wore her trademark large eyeglasses and black clothing, often declaring the merchandise \\"Fabulous!\\". In almost all of the commercials, she appeared alongside Magic the dog and various other stars from TV and fashion. She was portrayed as a parody by Ana Gasteyer on an episode of Saturday Night Live.  Early life  Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born in Lake Placid, New York. Carrie and her sister, Jane, lived primarily with their grandparents until 1942 when they then went to live with their mother. Donovan did not have a relationship with her father who left early on in her life. When Donovan was just 10 years old, she mailed her own sketches for a design collection to the actress Jane Wyman, who replied with a handwritten letter. She later attended the Parsons School of Design, graduating in 1950. Donovan never learned how to sew, so she had bribed her classmates to sew her test pieces for school. She worked as a journalist for 30 years; she always wrote her copy out by hand, because she never learned how to use a typewriter.  Career  Donovan's first job was at Saks Fifth Avenue, where she worked under Tatiana Liberman, who was married to Alexander Liberman, the editor of Vogue. Donovan was recruited by The New York Times Magazine in 1955 after she graduated from Parson's School of Design. A few years later Donovan was recruited by Diana Vreeland of Vogue. Donovan gained recognition as a style editor for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and the New York Times Magazine. Donovan later joined Harper's Bazaar and was senior editor from 1972-1977 before she went back to The New York Times Magazine. She was known for being able to quickly recognize talent, being among the first to praise the work of designers Donna Karan and Perry Ellis. It was her work for Old Navy, however, that brought her into the public eye.

The song is believed to have been based on another song called \\"Down by the River Liv'd a Maiden\\" by H. S. Thompson (1863). It is commonly performed in the key of F Major. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Synopsis Multiple variations of the song exist, but all center around Clementine, the daughter of a \\"miner forty-niner\\" and the singer's lover. One day while performing routine chores, Clementine trips and falls into a raging torrent of brine and drowns, as her lover is unable to swim and unwilling to attempt to rescue her. In Montrose's version, the song ends somewhat farcically by noting he won't go so far as necrophilia: \\"Though in life I used to hug her, now she's dead‚ÄîI'll draw the line.\\" History and origins The lyrics were written by Percy Montrose in 1884, based on an earlier song called \\"Down by the River Liv'd a Maiden\\". The origin of the melody is unknown. In his book South from Granada, Gerald Brenan claims that the melody was from an old Spanish ballad, made popular by Mexican miners during the California Gold Rush. It was best known from Romance del Conde Olinos o Ni√±o, a sad love story very popular in Spanish-speaking cultures. It was also given various English translations. No particular source is cited to verify that the song he used to hear in the 1920s in a remote Spanish village was not an old text with new music, but Brenan states in his preface that all the information in his book has been checked reasonably well. It is unclear when, where and by whom the song was first recorded in English, but the first version to reach the Billboard charts was that by Bing Crosby recorded on June 14, 1941, which briefly reached the No. 20 spot. It was given an updated and up-tempo treatment in an arrangement by Hal Hopper and John Scott Trotter. The re- written lyrics include a reference to Gene Autry (\\"could he sue me, Clementine?\\") amongst the five swinging verses. Notable versions There have been numerous versions of the song recorded over the years. =Bobby Darin version= Bobby Darin recorded a version of the song, credited to Woody Harris, in which Clementine is reimagined as a 299-pound beast of a woman. After she falls into the water, Darin implies that Clementine has transformed into a whale and calls out to those on the high seas to watch for her in a rhythm and style reminiscent of Darin's rendition of \\"Mack the Knife:\\" \\"Hey you sailor, way out in your whaler, a-with your harpoon and your trusty line, if she shows now, yell... there she blows now It just may be chunky Clementine\\". =Jan and Dean version= Jan and Dean had a hit with \\"Clementine\\", charting as high as 65 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was released on the Dore label (SP DORE 539 (US)) in November, 1959; \\"You're on My Mind\\" was the B Side. =Tom Lehrer version= Tom Lehrer recorded a set of variations on the song on his live album An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer, demonstrating his theory that \\"folk songs are so atrocious because they were written by the people.\\" He plays the first verse in the style of Cole Porter, the second in the style of \\"Mozart or one of that crowd\\", the third in a disjointed jazz sound in the style of Thelonious Monk, and the final verse in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan. =Other versions= * Television host Jack Narz recorded the song for his 1959 album Sing the Folk Hits With Jack Narz. * In 2004 the song was recorded by Westlife on their Allow Us to Be Frank. * The song is referenced in the lyrics of two separate songs by Elliott Smith. The first, \\"Clementine\\", from his 1995 self-titled album. The second, \\"Sweet Adeline\\", appears three years later on XO. * Megan Washington recorded \\"Clementine\\" in 2010. The song references some of the lyrics from the original. * In 2012 Neil Young and Crazy Horse recorded a minor-key hard-rock version of \\"Clementine\\" on their album Americana. In popular culture =Film= * The song plays during the opening credits for John Ford's 1946 movie My Darling Clementine, with Henry Fonda. It also runs as a background score all through the movie. * The 1963 film Hud, starring Paul Newman, included a scene in a small town movie theatre where the audience sang along to the song prior to the start of the main feature. * In the 1981 film Death Hunt, Charles Bronson's character sings part of the song to himself alone in his log cabin as his pursuers listen from outside. * The melody is whistled by the character J. Frank Parnell (played by Fox Harris) in the 1984 film Repo Man. * In the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, there are two references to the song (specifically its use by Huckleberry Hound): one at the beginning and one at the end, both regarding Clementine (Kate Winslet)'s name. Joel (Jim Carrey) mentions the song to Clementine when they introduce themselves, and Clementine sings the chorus to Joel on a train to Montauk. =Television= * The singing of the song was a signature trait and running gag of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Huckleberry Hound in episodes released in the late 1950s and early 1960s and in later appearances, often sung as \\"Oh My Darling, What's-Her-Name\\". * At the end of M*A*S*H episode 22 of season 5, \\"Movie Tonight\\", the song is sung by all the staff in the operating room after an abortive attempt to view the John Ford film My Darling Clementine * In 1992, Peter Brooke, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, sang \\"Darlin' Clementine\\" on The Late Late Show on Republic of Ireland television.

Columbo also sings it in the 1978 episode \\"Make Me A Perfect Murder. * In 2020, two, time-travelling characters in season five of Outlander sing this song to their son. The scene takes place in the year 1770, but the passage they sing includes the lyrics, \\"Dwelt a miner, forty-niner,\\" a reference to the 1849 California gold rush. * In the 2020 Netflix series It‚Äôs Okay To Not Be Okay, one of the major mysteries of the first series was its repeated use for various characters, foreshadowing its significance to the plot. =Use of melody= * The melody is used in \\"Xƒ´nni√°n H«éo\\" (), a Chinese New Year song. * The melody is used in \\"Dip The Apple In The Honey\\", a Jewish new years song. * The melody was applied to \\"Erika\\", a German marching song (however, the original version used by the military did not use this melody). * The melody for the song has become popular as the rhythm for a number of chants by sports supporters, such as the Barmy Army, popularized by the 1998 hit song \\"Carnaval de Paris\\" by English dance trio Dario G. * The chorus to Cher Lloyd's 2011 single Swagger Jagger was seen as heavily borrowed from the melody of \\"Oh My Darling Clementine\\" * The melody was used by Cesar Climaco in his campaign as Mayor of Zamboanga City. The people of Zamboanga sang this song in Chavacano also at his funeral after he was assassinated in 1984.

Released in 2005, it is the first handheld game in the Mario Party series, and differs from other titles in that the game is mostly single-player. Mario Party Advance was followed by Mario Party DS for the Nintendo DS in 2007, and was re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014.  Gameplay  left The player can choose from four different Mario characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Yoshi. The player drives a car around a party board, similar to those seen in the previous Mario Party games. Depending on the character chosen, the player will start at a different area on the board. The player starts with four Mushrooms. Additional Mushrooms are earned by winning minigames that are played every three turns. The game is over when there are no Mushrooms left. The multiplayer Party Mode that was present in all of the previous Mario Party games is no longer available, and it has been replaced by a new mode called \\"Shroom City\\". The aim of the game is to collect all the minigames and \\"Gaddgets\\" that were scattered around Shroom City by Bowser, by completing quests assigned to the player by the various inhabitants of Shroom City. Gaddgets, invented by Professor E. Gadd, are interactive items such as a Morse code generator and a love meter. The game includes over 120 minigames, including Gaddgets. Approximately 12 of the minigames can be played in multiplayer mode, with the use of a Game Link Cable. Certain Gaddgets can also be played in multiplayer mode if players control different buttons on a single Game Boy Advance system. The game also included a paper game board for multiple players that could be played in conjunction with the game cartridge, used by players to roll the dice and to play minigames.  Reception  Mario Party Advance received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40. While the game contains a large number of minigames and unlockables, reviewers criticized the game's tendency to punish players based on random chance, rebuked the game for lack of innovation in the minigames, and expressed concerns about the game's limited multiplayer modes. Craig Harris of IGN criticized the game's \\"incredibly basic and rudimentary graphic and sound presentation\\", as well as its \\"slowpaced\\" single-player mode, its large amount of dialogue, and wrote that most of its minigames \\"are actually on the bland side, featuring some rudimentary platform challenges or memory games that have been done a billion times before in other games. The 2D environment must have restricted the team's creativity in providing some challenges that are imaginative and fun.\\" Frank Provo of GameSpot called the game's multiplayer modes \\"fairly limited and poorly organized\\", but said the single-player mode \\"is very nicely organized and offers a great deal of variety\\". Provo praised the \\"colorful\\" character sprites, but criticized the game's \\"bland\\" backgrounds and some of its minigames. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer wrote that it was \\"practically the dictionary definition of awful\\", noting that \\"most - if not all - of its hundred odd mini games are among some of the most insultingly undemanding and badly-designed efforts you'll ever see associated with the beloved franchise\\". Reed said \\"a typical game within Mario Party Advance is often tedious, badly designed and completely lacking in any endearing qualities at all. [...] Animation is virtually non existent, the tedious chatty exchanges that take place between characters lacks any imagination at all and the whole project just smells like something thrown together to meet a contractual obligation\\". Karen Chu of 1UP.com wrote, \\"Though I'm open to new possibilities and reinterpretations of Mario Party, playing this game made me want to just jump on my Gamecube and play the original console versions -- even if I have to play against 3 CPU players because frankly, being the only player on a board game that's advertised as a party is just disheartening.\\" In 2015, IGN listed the game at the bottom of its list of \\"Best Mario Party Games\\", writing, \\"Mario Party Advance is the black sheep of the Mario Party series. This handheld version forwent the classic style of four players collecting stars and coins in favor of a single player focused mode. The heart of the Mario Party series lies in its multiplayer, so while this new approach brought a few interesting ideas, it never achieved what made all the other games so enticing.\\" Notes  References   External links  Advance 2005 video games Game Boy Advance games Video games developed in Japan Virtual Console games Virtual Console games for Wii U Multiplayer video games ","title":"Mario Party Advance"},{"id":"1215418","text":"Juhayman ibn Muhammad ibn Sayf al-Otaybi ( 16 September 1936 ‚Äì 9 January 1980) was a Saudi militant and soldier who in 1979 led the Grand Mosque seizure of the Great Mosque of Mecca, Saudi Arabia's holiest mosque, to protest against the Saudi monarchy and the House of Saud. Juhayman said that his justification for the siege was that the House of Saud had lost its legitimacy through corruption and imitation of the West, an echo of his father's charge in 1921 against former Saudi king Ibn Saud. Unlike earlier anti-monarchist dissidents in the kingdom, Juhayman attacked the Saudi ulama for failing to protest against policies that betrayed Islam, and accused them of accepting the rule of an infidel state and offering loyalty to corrupt rulers in \\"exchange for honours and riches.\\" On 20 November 1979, the first day of the Islamic year 1400, the Great Mosque of Mecca was seized by a well-organized group of 400 to 500 men under al-Otaybi's leadership.Karen Elliott House, On Saudi Arabia: Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future, New York, New York: Alfred P.

French Special Forces provided a special tear gas (CS gas) which prevents aggressiveness and slows down breathing. al-Otaybi was executed by the Saudi authorities, in public, on 9 January 1980, in Mecca. Biography Otaybi was born in al-Sajir, Al-Qassim Province, a settlement established by King Abdulaziz to house Ikhwan bedouin tribesmen who had fought for him. This settlement (known as a hijra) was populated by members of Otaybi's tribe, the 'Utaybah tribe,Lacey 1981, p. 481; Ruthven, p. 8; Abir, p. 150 one of the most pre-eminent tribes of the Najd region.Lunn 2003: 945 Many of Otaybi's relatives participated in the Battle of Sabilla during the Ikhwan uprising against King Abdulaziz, including his father and grandfather, Sultan bin Bajad al-Otaibi. Otaybi grew up aware of the battle and of how, in their eyes, the Saudi monarchs had betrayed the original religious principles of the Saudi state.Lacroix & Holoch 2011: 93 He finished school without fluent writing ability, but he loved to read religious texts. He served in the Saudi Arabian National Guard from 1955 to 1973. He was thin and 6' 1¬Ω\\" (187 cm) in height according to his friends in the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Education Otaybi did not complete primary education, but he just attended school until the fourth grade. After his military service he moved to Medina. It is when he met with Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al Qahtani. Otaybi, upon moving to Medina, joined the local chapter of a Salafi group called Al-Jamaa al- Salafiya al-Muhtasiba (The Salafi group that commands right and forbids wrong), which was founded in the mid-1960s by several of Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani's disciples. Many of the group's members and scholars were either of Bedouin descent or non-Saudis residents, and therefore marginalized in the religious establishment. Their activism was at least partially motivated by this marginalization. Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz used his religious stature to arrange fundraising for the group, and Otaybi earned money by buying, repairing and re-selling cars from city auctions. Otaybi lived in a \\"makeshift compound\\" about a half hour's walk to the Prophet's Mosque, and his followers stayed in a nearby dirt-floored hostel called Bayt al-Ikhwan (\\"House of the Brothers\\"). Otaybi and his devotees obeyed an austere and simple lifestyle, searching the Quran and Hadith for scriptural evidence of what was permissible not only for their beliefs but in their day-to-day lives. Otaybi was perturbed by the encroachment of Western beliefs and Bid‚Äòah (, innovation) in Saudi society to the detriment of (what he believed to be) true Islam. He opposed the integration of women into the workforce, television, the immodest shorts worn by football players during matches, and Saudi currency with an image of the King on it. By 1977, ibn Baz had departed to Riyadh and Otaybi became the leader of a faction of young recruits that developed their own‚Äîsometimes unorthodox‚Äîreligious doctrines. When older members of the Jamaa travelled to Medina to confront Otaybi about these developments, the two factions split from each other. Otaybi attacked the elder sheikhs as government sellouts and called his new group al-Ikhwan. In the late 1970s, he moved to Riyadh, where he drew the attention of the Saudi security forces. He and approximately 100 of his followers were arrested in the summer of 1978 for demonstrating against the monarchy, but were released after ibn BƒÅz questioned them and pronounced them harmless. He married both the daughter of Prince Sajer Al MohayaThe Makkan Siege: In Defense of JuhaymƒÅn , p.7 pdf. A collection of internet articles. and the sister of Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al Qahtani.

Though it was only functional for 165 years, it is often considered to be the longest arch bridge in both total and span length for more than 1,000 years.The bridge seems to have been surpassed in length by another Roman bridge across the Danube, Constantine's Bridge, a little-known structure whose length is given at 2,437 m (; ). In China, the 6th century single-span Anji Bridge had a comparable span of 123 feet or 37 meters. The bridge was constructed in 105 AD by instruction of Emperor Trajan by Greek architect Apollodorus of Damascus before his Second Dacian War to allow Roman troops to cross the river.  Description  Relief of the bridge on Trajan's Column showing the unusually flat segmental arches on high-rising concrete piers; in the foreground emperor Trajan sacrificing by the Danube The bridge was situated east of the Iron Gates, near the present-day cities of Drobeta- Turnu Severin in Romania and Kladovo in Serbia. Its construction was ordered by the Emperor Trajan as a supply route for the Roman legions fighting in Dacia. The structure was long (the Danube is now wide in that area), wide, and high, measured from the surface of the river. At each end was a Roman castrum, each built around an entrance, so that crossing the bridge was possible only by walking through the camps. The castra were called Pontes and Drobeta (Drobetis). On the right bank, at the modern village of Kostol near Kladovo, a castrum Pontes with a civilian settlement was built in 103. It occupied several hectares and was built concurrently with the bridge. Remnants of the long castrum with thick ramparts are still visible today. Fragments of ceramics, bricks with Roman markings and coins have been excavated. A bronze head of Emperor Trajan has also been discovered in Pontes. It was part of a statue which was erected at the bridge entrance and is today kept in the National Museum in Belgrade. On the left bank there was a Drobeta castrum. There was also a bronze statue of Trajan on that side of the bridge. Trajan's Road cut in the cliffs of the right bank of the Danube. Military road at Dunube frontier from Singidunum via Viminacium through the Iron Gates to the Trajan's bridge was secured by numerous castrums. Iron Gates in 1930s. The bridge's engineer, Apollodorus of Damascus, used wooden arches, each spanning , set on twenty masonry pillars made of bricks, mortar, and pozzolana cement.The earliest identified Roman caisson construction was at Cosa, a small Roman colony north of Rome, where similar caissons formed a breakwater as early as the 2nd century BC: International Handbook of Underwater Archaeology, 2002.Fern√°ndez Troyano, Leonardo, \\"Bridge Engineering - A Global Perspective\\", Thomas Telford Publishing, 2003 It was built unusually quickly (between 103 and 105), employing the construction of a wooden caisson for each pier.In the first century BC, Roman engineers had employed wooden caissons in constructing the Herodian harbour at Caesarea Maritima: Carol V. Ruppe, Jane F. Barstad, eds. International Handbook of Underwater Archaeology, 2002, \\"Caesarea\\" pp505f. The ruins of the bridge at the beginning of the 20th century, Romania. Apollodorus applied the technique of river flow relocation, using the principles set by Thales of Miletus some six centuries beforehand. Engineers waited for a low water level to dig a canal, west of the modern downtown of Kladovo. The water was redirected downstream from the construction site, through the lowland of , to the location of the modern village of Mala Vrbica. Wooden pillars were driven into the river bed in a rectangular layout, which served as the foundation for the supporting piers, which were coated with clay. The hollow piers were filled with stones held together by mortar, while from the outside they were built around with Roman bricks. The bricks can still be found around the village of Kostol, retaining the same physical properties that they had 2 millennia ago. The piers were tall, wide and apart. It is considered today that the bridge construction was assembled on the land and then installed on the pillars. A mitigating circumstance was that the year the relocating canals were dug was very dry and the water level was quite low. The river bed was almost completely drained when the foundation of the pillars began. There were 20 pillars in total in an interval of . Oak wood was used and the bridge was high enough to allow ship transport on the Danube. Diana Fortress, built in 100 AD during Trajan's preparations for the Dacian wars, Moesia Superior (Serbia). The bricks also have a historical value, as the members of the Roman legions and cohorts which participated in the construction of the bridge carved the names of their units into the bricks. Thus, it is known that work was done by the legions of IV Flavia Felix, VII Claudia, V Macedonica and XIII Gemina and the cohorts of I Cretum, II Hispanorum, III Brittonum and I Antiochensium. Drobeta fort on the left/north bank of the Danube (Romania), which secured access to Trajan's bridge. On the right/south bank of the Danube (Serbia) are the remains of the Pontes castrum, which served the same purpose. Construction of the bridge was part of a wider project, which included the digging of sideway canals so that whitewater rapids could be avoided in order to make the Danube safer for navigation, building of a powerful river fleet and defense posts, and development of the intelligence service on the border. The Iron Gate Cataract was especially problematic, as navigation was not possible during low waters, when the rocky and lumpy river bed would block the passage of ships on the entire width of the Danube. As the heavy equipment necessary for lifting major boulders from the river bed and dragging them onto the bank wasn't available at the time, the Roman engineers decided to cut the canal through the stone slopes on the west bank. It began from the Iron Gate, going upstream to the point where the rapids start, which is a bit downstream from the modern village of Novi Sip. The remains of the embankment which protected the area during the construction of the canal show the magnitude of the works. The long canal bypassed the problematic section of the river in an arch-like style. Former canals were filled with sand, and empty shells are regularly found in the ground. All these works, especially the bridge, served the purpose of preparing for the Roman invasion of Dacia, which ended with Roman victory in 106 AD. The effect of finally defeating the Dacians and acquiring their gold mines was so great that Roman games celebrating the conquest lasted for 123 days, with 10,000 gladiators engaging in fights and 11,000 wild animals being killed during that period.  Tabula Traiana  Tabula Traiana and road, near Kladovo, Serbia, 1930s. A Roman memorial plaque (\\"Tabula Traiana\\"), 4 metres wide and 1.75 metres high, commemorating the completion of Trajan's military road is located on the Serbian side facing Romania near Ogradina. In 1972, when the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station was built (causing the water level to rise by about 35m), the plaque was moved from its original location, and lifted to the present place. It reads: :IMP. CAESAR. DIVI. NERVAE. F NERVA TRAIANVS. AVG. GERM PONTIF MAXIMUS TRIB POT IIII PATER PATRIAE COS III MONTIBVS EXCISI(s) ANCO(ni)BVS SVBLAT(i)S VIA(m) F(ecit) The text was interpreted by Otto Benndorf to mean: :Emperor Caesar son of the divine Nerva, Nerva Trajan, the Augustus, Germanicus, Pontifex Maximus, invested for the fourth time as Tribune, Father of the Fatherland, Consul for the third time, excavating mountain rocks and using wood beams has made this road. The Tabula Traiana was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and is protected by the Republic of Serbia. = Relocation = Relocated Tabula Traiana. When the plan for the future hydro plant and its reservoir was made in 1965, it was clear that numerous settlements along the banks would be flooded in both Yugoslavia and Romania, and that historical remains, including the plaque, would also be affected. Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts urged for the plaque to be preserved and the government accepted the motion. The enterprise entrusted with the task of relocation was the mining company \\"Venƒçac\\" as its experts previously participated in the relocation of the Abu Simbel temple in Egypt. First idea was to leave the plaque at its position and to build the caisson around it but the calculations showed this wouldn't work. The idea of cutting the plaque in several smaller pieces in order to be moved was abandoned due to the quality of the rock of which it was made. The proposition of lifting it with the floating elevator \\"Veli Jo≈æe\\" was discarded, too. The motion of cutting the table in one piece and placing it somewhere else was rejected as the plaque would lose its authenticity. In the end it was decided to dig in a new bed into the rock above the plaque's original location. The plaque was then cut in one piece with the parts of the surrounding rock and road. After being cut with the cable saws, the 350 tons heavy chunk was lifted to the new bed. Works began in September 1967 and were finished in 1969.  Destruction and remains  Remains of the Trajan's Bridge on the right bank of Danube, Serbia. The wooden superstructure of the bridge was dismantled by Trajan's successor, Hadrian, presumably in order to protect the empire from barbarian invasions from the north. The superstructure was destroyed by fire. Iron Gate I dam, Romania. The remains of the bridge reappeared in 1858 when the level of the Danube hit a record low due to the extensive drought. The twenty pillars were still visible. In 1906, the Commission of the Danube decided to destroy two of the pillars that were obstructing navigation. In 1932, there were 16 pillars remaining underwater, but in 1982 only 12 were mapped by archaeologists; the other four had probably been swept away by water. Only the entrance pillars are now visible on either bank of the Danube,Romans Rise from the Waters one in Romania and one in Serbia. In 1979, Trajan's Bridge was added to the Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance, and in 1983 on Archaeological Sites of Exceptional Importance list, and by that it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.

The attacks, which covered an area spanning , were said to have been committed by one or more beasts with formidable teeth and immense tails, according to contemporary eyewitnesses. Most descriptions from the period identify the beast as a wolf, dog, or wolf-dog hybrid. Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of money and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 210 attacks, resulting in 113 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten. Other sources claim the animal or animals killed between 60 and 100 adults and children and injured more than 30. The beast was reported killed several times before the attacks finally stopped. Description Descriptions of the time vary, and reports may have been greatly exaggerated due to public hysteria, but the beast was generally described as a wolf-like canine with a tall, lean frame capable of taking great strides. It had an elongated head similar to that of a greyhound, with a flattened snout, pointed ears, and a wide mouth sitting atop a broad chest. The beast's tail was also said to have been notably longer than a wolf's, with a tuft at the end. The beast's fur was described as tawny or russet in color but its back was streaked with black and a white heart-shaped pattern was noted on its underbelly.Pourcher, Pierre (1889). Translated by Brockis, Derek The Beast of Gevaudan AuthorHokuse, 2006, p. 5 History An 18th-century print showing Marie Jeanne Vallet (also known as \\"The Maid of G√©vaudan\\") defending herself from the beast =Beginnings= The Beast of G√©vaudan committed its first recorded attack in the early summer of 1764. A young woman named Marie Jeanne Vallet, who was tending cattle in the Mercoire forest near the town of Langogne in the eastern part of G√©vaudan, saw the beast come at her. However, the bulls in the herd charged the beast, keeping it at bay. They then drove it off after it attacked a second time. Shortly afterwards the first official victim of the beast was recorded: 14-year-old Janne Boulet was killed near the village of Les Hubacs near Langogne. Throughout the remainder of 1764, more attacks were reported across the region. Very soon terror gripped the populace because the beast was repeatedly preying on lone men, women, and children as they tended livestock in the forests around G√©vaudan. Reports note that the Beast seemed only to target the victim's head or neck regions. By late December 1764, rumours had begun circulating that there might be a pair of animals behind the killings. This was because there had been such a high number of attacks in such a short space of time, and because many of the attacks appeared to have occurred or were reported nearly simultaneously. Some contemporary accounts suggest the creature was seen with another such animal, while others report that the beast was accompanied by its young. On January 12, 1765, Jacques Portefaix and seven friends were attacked by the beast. After several attacks, they drove it away by staying grouped together. The encounter eventually came to the attention of Louis XV, who awarded 300 livres to Portefaix and another 350 livres to be shared among his companions. The king also directed that Portefaix be educated at the state's expense. He then decreed that the French state would help find and kill the beast. =Royal intervention= An 18th-century engraving of Fran√ßois Antoine slaying the wolf of Chazes First captain Duhamel of the Clermont Prince dragoons and his troops were soon sent to Le G√©vaudan. Although extremely zealous in his efforts, non- cooperation on the part of the local herders and farmers stalled Duhamel's efforts. On several occasions he almost shot the beast, but was hampered by the incompetence of his guards. When the village of Le Malzieu was not present and ready as the beast crossed the Truy√®re river, Duhamel became frustrated. When Louis XV agreed to send two professional wolf-hunters, Jean Charles Marc Antoine Vaumesle d'Enneval and his son Jean-Fran√ßois, Captain Duhamel was forced to stand down and return to his headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand. Cooperating with d'Enneval was impossible as the two differed too much in their strategies; Duhamel organised hunting parties while d'Enneval and his son believed the beast could only be shot using stealthy techniques. Father and son D'Enneval arrived in Clermont-Ferrand on February 17, 1765, bringing with them eight bloodhounds that had been trained in wolf-hunting. Over the next four months the pair hunted for Eurasian wolves, believing that one or more of these animals was the beast. However, when the attacks continued, the D'Ennevals were replaced in June 1765 by Fran√ßois Antoine (sometimes wrongly identified with his son, Antoine de Beauterne), the king's sole arquebus- bearer and Lieutenant of the Hunt, who arrived in Le Malzieu on June 22. On September 20 or 21, Antoine killed a large grey wolf measuring high, long and weighing . The wolf, which was named Le Loup de Chazes after the nearby Abbaye des Chazes, was said to have been quite large for a wolf. Antoine officially stated: \\"We declare by the present report signed from our hand, we never saw a big wolf that could be compared to this one. Hence, we believe this could be the fearsome beast that caused so much damage.\\" The animal was further identified as the culprit by attack survivors, who recognised the scars on its body inflicted by victims defending themselves. The wolf was stuffed and sent to Versailles, where Antoine's son Antoine de Beauterne was hailed as a hero. Antoine stayed in the Auvergne woods to chase down the female partner of the beast and her two grown pups. Antoine succeeded in killing the female wolf and a pup, which seemed already larger than its mother. At the examination of the pup, it appeared to have a double set of dewclaws, a hereditary malformation found in the Bas-Rouge or Beauceron dog breed. The other pup was shot and hit and was believed to have died while retreating between the rocks. Antoine kept his fear and doubts: after all was not the beast shot, stabbed, and believed to be killed at different occasions, too? With one pup that Antoine could not find, he returned to Paris and received a large sum of money (over 9,000 livres) as well as fame, titles, and awards. However, on December 2, two boys were attacked, one of 6 and one of 12 years old, suggesting that the beast was still alive. It tried to capture the youngest one, but it was successfully fought off by the older boy. Soon after, successful attacks followed and some of the shepherds witnessed that this time, or this beast, showed no fear around cattle at all. A dozen more deaths are reported to have followed attacks near La Besseyre-Saint-Mary. =Final attacks= The killing of the creature that eventually marked the end of the attacks is credited to a local hunter named Jean Chastel, who shot it at the slopes of Mont Mouchet (now called la Sogne d'Auvers) during a hunt organised by a local nobleman, the Marquis d'Apchier, on June 19, 1767. Abb√© Fabre reprinted the sworn account which said that Chastel shot the creature with a large-caliber bullet and buckshot combination, self-made with silver. The body was then brought to the castle of Marquis d'Apchier, where it was stuffed by Dr. Boulanger, a surgeon at Saugues. Dr. Boulanger's post-mortem report was transcribed by notary Marin and is known as the \\"Marin Report\\" on the beast. Upon being opened, the animal's stomach was shown to contain the remains of its last victim. Hypotheses The wolf shot by Fran√ßois Antoine on September 21, 1765, displayed at the court of Louis XV According to modern scholars, public hysteria at the time of the attacks contributed to widespread myths that supernatural beasts roamed G√©vaudan, but deaths attributed to a beast were more likely the work of a number of wolves or packs of wolves. In 2001, the French naturalist Michel Louis proposed that the red-colored mastiff belonging to Jean Chastel sired the beast and its resistance to bullets may have been due to it wearing the armoured hide of a young boar, thus also accounting for its unusual colour. Attacks by wolves were a very serious problem during the era, not only in France but throughout Europe, with tens of thousands of deaths attributed to wolves in the 18th century alone.The man-eater of G√©vaudan: when the serial killer is an animal, by Giovanni Todaro, 2014, Lulu Com, 539 pages, In the spring of 1765, in the midst of the G√©vaudan hysteria, an unrelated series of attacks occurred near the commune of Soissons, northeast of Paris, when an individual wolf killed at least four people over a period of two days before being tracked and killed by a man armed with a pitchfork. Such incidents were fairly typical in rural parts of western and central Europe. The Marin Report describes the creature as a wolf of unusually large proportions \\"This animal which seemed to us to be a wolf; But extraordinary and Very different by its figure and its proportions Of the wolves that we see in this country. This is what we have certified by more than three hundred people from all around who came to see him:\\"https://labetedugevaudan.com/pdf/rapport_marin.pdf Despite the widely held interpretation, based on most of the historical research, that the beast was a wolf or other wild canid, several alternative theories have been proposed, such as a hypothetical lion.Carnivore Attacks on Humans in Historic France and Germany: To Which Species Did the Attackers Belong? by Karl-Hans Taake.

The show was Anderson's first in over a decade to use puppets for its characters, and also his last. Anderson's previous puppet- centric TV series included Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. Set in the year 2020, the series follows the adventures of the Terrahawks, a taskforce responsible for protecting Earth from invasion by a group of extraterrestrial androids and aliens led by Zelda. Like Anderson's previous puppet series, futuristic vehicles and technology featured prominently in each episode. Premise The series is set in the year 2020, after an alien force has destroyed NASA's Mars base and Earth is under threat. A small organisation, The Terrahawks, is set up to defend the planet. From Hawknest, their secret base in South America, they develop sophisticated weapons to prepare for the battles to come. Terrahawks was less straight-laced than any of Anderson's previous series, featuring a wry, tongue-in-cheek humour as well as dramatic jeopardy. The ensemble cast, with each member assigned a vehicle, had many similarities with Anderson's Thunderbirds, whilst the alien invasion plot was reminiscent of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons and the live action UFO. History Prior to Terrahawks and throughout the entirety of the 1960s, Anderson's series were noted for their use of his patented Supermarionation technique, which made use of electronically augmented marionettes (the final series to use this technique was the live action/Supermarionation hybrid The Secret Service in 1969; Anderson switched to live action production beginning with 1970's UFO). In contrast, producers of Terrahawks made use of latex muppet-style hand puppets to animate the characters, in a process Anderson dubbed Supermacromation. This was partly dictated by the relatively low budget (latex hand puppets being much cheaper to produce than the sculpted wooden marionettes of previous series), but the absence of strings allowed for much smoother movement, and could be used to more easily produce the illusion of the puppets walking. The necessarily static puppets of previous series had been a source of frustration to Anderson during his Supermarionation days. =Production= The series' most prolific contributor, Tony Barwick, constantly used tongue-in-cheek aliases whenever he wrote a different episode, calling himself, for instance, \\"Anne Teakstein,\\" and \\"Felix Catstein.\\" (He was not alone in this; Donald James wrote the episodes \\"From Here To Infinity\\" and \\"The Sporilla\\" under the names \\"Katz Stein\\" and \\"Leo Pardstein\\" respectively.) The only episodes of the series not credited to pseudonyms ending in \\"-stein\\" are \\"The Midas Touch,\\" scripted by Trevor Lansdowne and Tony Barwick, the latter billed under his real name for the only time on the series, and the two-part opener \\"Expect The Unexpected,\\" written by Gerry Anderson. A fourth season would have developed the characters of Stew Dapples (\\"Stewed Apples\\") and Kate Kestrel further. This was explained in a documentary on the special features disc of the series, in the Gerry Anderson book \\"Supermarionation\\" and the Terrahawks DVDs. Two of the scripts were called \\"101 Seed\\" (a parody of the title \\"Number One Seed\\"), written by Anderson himself (as \\"Gerry Anderstein\\"), and \\"Attempted MOIDer\\" by Tony Barwick (alias in this case D.I. Skeistein). In the UK, six specially prepared compilations of Terrahawks were released on video cassette, covering 24 out of 26 episodes from the first season. The first tape contained a few scenes in the premiere episode that had been edited out of the broadcast master due to time constraints (those scenes are not on DVD). The final volume, entitled \\"Zero Strikes Back\\" had a smaller print run than the rest of the tapes, and was quite a collectors' item, with copies generally going for around ¬£100 on eBay until the series began to be released on DVD. The series is available on DVD in the United Kingdom and North America. A Blu-ray release of the first series was released in June 2016. Unlike virtually all of Gerry Anderson's other puppet-based series, Terrahawks was not produced by ITC Entertainment. This meant that after Terrahawks repeats disappeared from UK airwaves in the late 1980s and the six compilation video tapes went out of production, the series was noticeably hard to find compared to Anderson's other series, most of which received a renaissance throughout the 1990s. =Title sequence and end credits= The opening and closing sequences were created using hand-drawn cel animation to imitate computer graphics. The opening title sequence begins with a video game playing on a screen when Doctor \\"Tiger\\" Ninestein appears and says: \\"Terrahawks! Stay on this channel! This is an emergency!\\". The end credits, the Zeroid and Cube robots would often \\"play\\" noughts and crosses (tic-tac- toe) with each other, resulting in a different winner each week (the Cubes usually had to cheat and steal a Zeroid's position in order to win). The exception to this was the episode \\"A Christmas Miracle\\", which featured the song \\"I Believe in Christmas\\" as sung by Kate Kestrel played over a still of a Zeroid. The original opening title sequence was used for both the United States and the UK versions of the series, but a different version of the end credits was produced for the US variant, featuring a Zeroid bouncing up and down next to one of Zelda's Cubes as a \\"Kate Kestrel\\" song plays. At the conclusion of the credits the Zeroid jumps off of the screen and crashes back down onto the Cube. When the series was purchased for airing in Japan, the title and ending credits were augmented by an all-new anime-style sequence, the first highlighting the Terrahawks craft and the Zeroids, and the ending credits showcasing a lonesome spacesuited female remembering her life on Earth as Spacehawk flies over her. The songs used in these sequences are and , respectively, by The Lillies Naomi and Mayumi Tsubame. =Music= Without the lavish budgets of his earlier television series, it was apparent to Gerry Anderson from a very early stage of production that it would not be possible to record full orchestral scores for Terrahawks. However, the development of synthesised music had advanced considerably since the early days of the experimental 'electromusic' composed and recorded by Barry Gray for Supercar and Fireball XL5, and by 1983 it was possible to create electronic music that could at least approach the scale and majesty of a full orchestra, but at a fraction of the cost. Richard Harvey was introduced to Anderson by a mutual friend, music producer Tony Prior, who has previously suggested Derek Wadsworth as composer of the music for Space: 1999 Year Two. A graduate of the Royal College of Music with a background in ancient and classical music, Harvey had worked extensively with film composer Maurice Jarre in the late 1970s. This experience made him the ideal choice to compose the music for Terrahawks, combining his knowledge of the structure of classical orchestral music with the latest synthesised music reproduction techniques. Anderson and his business partner Christoper Burr had regular meetings with Harvey to discuss the style of music that they wanted for Terrahawks, particularly the main theme which was envisaged as a combination of the 'best bits' of the themes to Star Wars, E.T. and Dallas. In 2002, Fanderson records released a soundtrack compiling 75 minutes worth of music, the album included 3 of Harvey‚Äôs Demo Themes for the show, 6 full episode scores and 3 surviving Kate Kestrel songs, \\"S.O.S\\", \\"It‚Äôs So Easy\\" and the latter half of \\"Living in the 21st Century\\" which was used as the End Titles music in the U.S. syndication run. The remaining songs and first half of \\"Living in the 21st Century\\" are currently missing, presumed destroyed. Audio revival It was announced on 19 April 2014 that Terrahawks would be returning as a run of full cast audio dramas featuring original cast members. The new audio series were produced by Anderson Entertainment in association with Big Finish Productions. The first new series was released in April 2015, and consists of eight episodes. Ann Ridler who played Kate Kestrel and Cy-Star was replaced by Beth Chalmers, as Ridler had since died, and Windsor Davies who played Sergeant Major Zero was replaced by Jeremy Hitchen, as Davies had retired from acting. A second series was released by Big Finish Productions in April 2016, and a third in July 2017. Free sample episodes are available on the Big Finish website. Characters =The Terrahawks= Terrahawks (technically, the Earth Defence Squadron) is an elite task force that protects Earth from alien invasion. * Doctor \\"Tiger\\" Ninestein (real first name unknown): Terrahawk's pilot and the team's leader, so named as he is the ninth clone created by Dr. Gerhard Stein. Somewhat bloodthirsty, his first reaction to alien contact is often to blast it out of the sky. In between alien attacks, he is often seen trying (and failing) to beat the high score on his favourite video game. Ninestein's catchphrases are \\"Expect the unexpected\\", \\"I have a theory...\\" and, when frustrated, he often cries, \\"Flaming thunderbolts!\\" He also has a love-hate relationship with the Zeroids, particularly Sergeant Major Zero, and tends to push around Hawkeye. If he is killed, he can be replaced within 24 hours by another of the nine clones; his nickname of \\"Tiger\\" comes from the myth of cats similarly having \\"nine lives\\". Tiger's voice was provided by Jeremy Hitchen, who claimed he provided that voice in somewhat of an imitation of Jack Nicholson. * Captain Mary Falconer: Battlehawk's pilot. She acts as Ninestein's second-in-command, weighing his offensive tendencies with her own regard for the value of life...whether in regards to one of Zelda's henchmen, or to the Zeroids. She was voiced by Denise Bryer. Bryer used her normal voice for the role, unlike many of her other famous roles where she normally tended to use a \\"clucking\\" tone more typical of the voice of the character Zelda from Terrahawks, whom Bryer also voiced. * Captain Kate Kestrel (real name: Katherine Westley): The pilot of the Hawkwing fighter aircraft and number three in Terrahawks' chain of command. Kate is also an internationally famous pop singer. Her record company is \\"Anderburr Records\\" ‚Äì a portmanteau of \\"Anderson\\" and \\"Burr.\\" She was voiced by Anne Ridler when speaking; Moya Griffiths (now Moya Ruskin) provided her singing voice. Beth Chalmers provides the voice of Kate in the audio productions, due to Ridler's death in 2011.1. Terrahawks: Volume 1 ‚Äì Big Finish Big Finish. Retrieved 3 November 2014. * Lieutenant Hawkeye (real name: Hedley Howard Henderson III): Hawkwing's gunner. Due to a track-and-field accident, his eyes have been replaced with micro-computers that enhance his targeting abilities. When given an order, he always replies \\"aye-aye\\" as a pun on his name. He is number four in the Terrahawk chain of command. Hawkeye's voice was provided by Jeremy Hitchen. * Lieutenant Hiro (full name unknown): The commander of Spacehawk, Hiro keeps a large collection of flowers to which he gives names and reads poetry. As number five in Terrahawks' chain of command, his thick Japanese accent is sometimes a source of humour. Like Ninestein, Hiro was voiced by Jeremy Hitchen. Sergeant Major Zero action figure by Bandai * Zeroids: Spherical robots that perform ground operations and serve as the firepower for the Spacehawk. There are two leaders among the Zeroids who exhibit human-like capacity for thought and emotion, much to the mechanophobic Ninestein's annoyance, who believes they should be unthinking, unfeeling machines that blindly follow orders; Sergeant Major Zero (voiced by Windsor Davies in a characterisation not dissimilar from his portrayal of Sergeant Major Williams in It Ain't Half Hot, Mum), commands the Zeroids stationed on Earth, while Space Sergeant 101 (voiced by Robbie Stevens) directs the Zeroids stationed aboard Spacehawk; 101 and Zero often have arguments over command of Spacehawk. Other Zeroids are given distinct personality traits of their own, such as the Zeroid Dix-Huit, whose name is French for his number, eighteen, and who speaks French and has a handlebar moustache, 55, who bobs up and down in rhyme, 21, who has a stutter, and 66, who has a very thick Scottish accent. These accents irk Dr. Ninestein to the point he demanded they all be re-voiced in \\"The Gun\\", only for Zero to get back at him by giving them all his own voice. They can increase their mass (becoming as heavy as a black hole), which allows them to perform devastating body-crash manoeuvres. This is often accompanied by a cry of \\"St-roll on!\\" Sergeant Major Zero, for his part, as he launched into action, often gave the war cry of \\"GERONIMO!!!\\" Unlike the other cast members, Windsor Davies usually only voiced Sergeant Major Zero and The Sporilla (although in a couple of episodes he also provided the voice of another Zeroid, Dr. Killjoy), and in the Big Finish audio series the role of Zero has been taken over by Jeremy Hitchen. * Colonel Johnson (first name unknown): The head of WASA (World Aeronautics & Space Administration). Though he is ostensibly Terrahawks' co-director, in reality, Ninestein constantly overrides his authority. Jeremy Hitchen provided Colonel Johnson's voice, as well as those of Hiro and Ninestein. Terrahawks vehicles * Terrahawk ‚Äì A flying command centre, which can detach from the main body of the Battlehawk. This is Dr. Ninestein's personal ship. * Battlehawk ‚Äì A heavy-duty carrier aircraft which transports the Zeroids, the Megazoid-manned Battletank for heavy support, and other auxiliary equipment. * Hawkwing ‚Äì A fighter aircraft with a separate over-wing, which can be released to act as a flying impact bomb. * Treehawk ‚Äì A single-stage-to-orbit spaceship, which transports personnel, such as Lieutenant Hiro, to the Spacehawk. * Spacehawk ‚Äì An orbital battle station, customarily manned by Lieutenant Hiro, that provides the first line of defence against an attack. * Overlander ‚Äì A three-segment land vehicle used for transporting goods. In all of its appearances, it has been hijacked and subsequently destroyed. * Battletank ‚Äì A tank manned by a pair of Megazoids, usually used for major combat operations. It is transported by the Battlehawk, and is dropped out of its bay onto the ground. * Spacetank ‚Äì A tank designed for operations in a vacuum. It only appeared in one episode, manned by Zero and Dix Huit. * Hudson ‚Äì Ninestein's Rolls-Royce of indeterminate model, equipped with artificial intelligence and the ability to change its color. Ninestein is particularly fond of it. * Hawkhead ‚Äì A small two seater space craft that is stationed in Spacehawk's hangar bay. It appears only in the episodes \\"First Strike\\" and \\"Jolly Roger One\\". * MEV ‚Äì A space craft stationed aboard Spacehawk. It is outfitted with tread tracks for traversing terrain, and a grappling arm fitted with a cannon. * Groundhawk ‚Äì A bomb disposal and demolition vehicle that appears only in the episodes \\"Child's Play\\" and \\"Space Giant\\". =Aliens= Robots (\\"androids\\") from the planet Guk rebelled when their creators and masters deteriorated into a state of apathy. Zelda and company are modelled after the oldest and wisest citizens of their planet, explaining their grey hair and wrinkled skin. Zelda hopes to conquer Earth and make it a home for her Family of Androids and NONE-Human Beings. They need to consume only small amounts of silicate minerals a month to sustain their functions. * Zelda. The main villain of the series, Zelda is the wicked and scheming would-be conqueror of Earth. She has power over matter, mainly used to teleport her servants to and from Earth and to manipulate the size of any of her ships or aliens. \\"Zelda reclaims her own,\\" Dr. Ninestein frequently says whenever Zelda teleports a defeated minion back to the Mars base. She was created as a bodyguard for Prince Zegar of Guk, but her inherently programmed ambition led to a revolt by herself and her fellow androids. She is known for referring to humans as \\"Earth-scum\\", \\"Earth-pukes\\" and \\"Earth-Wretches\\". She believes the humans are evil and that she is there to deliver the universe from their evil, destructive ways. Her voice was provided by Denise Bryer. * Cy-star, pronounced \\"Si-ster.\\" Zelda's \\"sister\\" is not very bright, but is endlessly bubbly and optimistic. Frequently she gets so excited her hair slides around her head, leading Zelda to shout, in one episode, \\"One of these days I'm going to nail that to your skull!\\" She gives birth to It-star around the start of the Third Season. Her catchphrase is, \\"I don't understand\\" and \\"WONNNNNNDERFUL!\\" Her voice was provided on television by Anne Ridler and on audio by Beth Chalmers. * Yung-Star. Zelda's \\"son,\\" Yung-Star is, like his \\"aunt\\", not very intelligent ‚Äì he mistakes the term \\"nincompoop\\" for a compliment. However, he is also cowardly, lazy and greedy, although he is occasionally sent to accompany a monster. His catchphrase, uttered slowly in a revolting guttural voice, was \\"Great Steaming Lava!\\" Strangely enough, despite being an android, Yung-Star is partial to bowls of \\"granite crunchies\\" ‚Äì rocks in a slimy green goo; he consumes these frequently, leading Zelda to call him gluttonous since, as stated, the Guk androids need only to consume small amounts of silicate minerals to sustain their functions. He was voiced by Robbie Stevens. * It-Star is also known as \\"Goybirl\\" or \\"Birlgoy,\\" since Cy-Star never decided on what gender this construct would be. It-Star is a \\"baby\\" android mothered by Cy-Star near the end of the series. It-Star is a clearly a hermaphrodite with two minds and voices, a young girl's voice when \\"innocent,\\" and a male voice with a German accent when plotting. His plotting personality is highly vicious and clever, compared to the childish, infant-like one. The female voice was done by Denise Bryer while the male voice was by Jeremy Hitchen. * Cubes are the aliens' answer to the Zeroids. They can combine into large constructs such as guns and force field cubicles. Their different sides are marked differently, indicating their different functions, such as one serving as a gun. Cy-Star keeps one, Pluto, as a pet. Zelda's monsters Zelda possesses a collection of monstrous servants, Outcasts from various worlds or civilizations, who she keeps in cryogenic storage until needed. * Sram is a reptilian beast with a devastating roar, capable of shattering mountains and destroying Hawkwing's shots before they can get close enough to hit him. His blood gives off fumes that are highly toxic to human beings. In his first appearance Sram is quite articulate, but he does not speak in any further appearances. Sram appears in \\"Thunder-Roar,\\" \\"Thunder Path,\\" as Zelda's drummer in \\"Play it Again, Sram\\", a member of Zelda's war party in \\"First Strike\\", and a hallucination of him is seen in \\"Mind Monster\\". He also makes a brief cameo in the audio episode \\"The Prisoner of Zelda\\". * The Sporilla is a savagely powerful beast that Zelda controls with a signalling device. After the device is destroyed, however, the Terrahawks find that the Sporilla is capable of halting speech and has no desire to fight them. Appears in \\"The Sporilla.\\" In \\"Space Giant,\\" another Sporilla appears. The Sporilla is a 7-foot tall metal-eating space gorilla (SPace gORILLA), covered in an off-white fur, a black gorilla face with horns and fangs. An imaginary Sporilla appears in \\"Mind Monster\\", while another (real) Sporilla is Cystar's co-pilot in \\"My Enemy's Enemy\\". * MOID: The Master Of Infinite Disguise. He is a skeleton-like alien with almost non-existent facial features, and endowed with the capacity to assume the physical appearance of anyone. \\"I wear many faces, but have none of my own,\\" he once said to describe himself. The Terrahawks seem to find him pitiable, and he seems to regret living a life of servitude to Zelda. Despite working for her, he is also unwilling to take anyone's life. Appears in \\"Happy Madeday,\\" \\"Unseen Menace,\\" and briefly in \\"Play it Again, Sram\\" as Mozart before returning in the audio episode \\"The Prisoner of Zelda\\", where his origins are finally explored. He seems to have feelings for Kate Kestrel. A hallucination of him is seen in \\"Mind Monster.\\" * Yuri is a teddy bear-like creature the aliens find hideous and frightening. He possesses the power to mentally control metal. Zelda sometimes refers to him as \\"the furry Napoleon.\\" He appears in \\"The Ugliest Monster of All,\\" \\"Operation SAS,\\" \\"Terratomb,\\" and as a member of Zelda's war party in \\"First Strike.\\" He returned in the audio episode \\"Living Legend\\". * Lord Tempo. The master of time, Tempo can travel back and forth in time at will, and alter its flow locally. Lord Tempo appears in \\"My Kingdom for a ZEAF!\\", \\"Time Warp\\", \\"Timesplit\\", and as a member of Zelda's war party in \\"First Strike\\". * Tamura the space Samurai is a good and honourable alien with a powerful space cruiser, the \\"Ishimo\\". He intervenes in the dispute between Zelda and the Terrahawks with the aim of resolving the dispute. He is duped by Zelda who plans to double-cross him in order to destroy the Terrahawks. He finds out in time and Zelda's plan fails. He refers to Hiro is his \\"kindred spirit\\". He appears in the episode \\"Space Samurai\\". * The Krell is a hairy creature with an eyestalk that can fire a laser beam powerful enough to shoot down objects in orbit. It appears only in \\"The Midas Touch\\". * Cyclops is a black and red crawling creature with one giant eye. The cyclops absorbs metal. It appears only in \\"Space Cyclops\\". * Captain Goat is a space buccaneer who captained a pirate radio ship. He appears in \\"Jolly Roger One\\" and \\"Set Sail for Misadventure\\". * Cold Finger is an alien who is an expert at weaponising water and ice. His entire ship was made of ice. He only appears in Cold Finger. =Audio-only characters= Characters who only appear in the Big Finish audio series include; * Lois Price is a NASA operative who was sent to Hawknest to investigate the necessity of the continued funding of the Terrahawks project. She also became unintentionally involved in a plot by her commanding officer to eliminate the Terrahawks and later went behind her superiors' backs to give Ninestein command of the X-99 fleet. Voiced by Beth Chalmers, she appears in \\"The Price is Right\\", \\"Chain of Command\\", \\"My Enemy's Enemy\\", \\"Set Sail for Misadventure\\", \\"The Prisoner of Zelda\\" and \\"Enemies, Negotiation and Deceit\\". Her name is a pun: Lowest price. * Zeroid 35 is an inexperienced and overenthusiastic female Zeroid with a crush on Sergeant Major Zero. Originally posted to Spacehawk, she was later transferred to Hawknest after her bravery during the Watchdog affair. Voiced by Beth Chalmers, she appears in \\"Return to Sender\\", \\"Renta-hawks\\", \\"My Enemy's Enemy\\", \\"No Second Chances\\", \\"Living Legend\\", and \\"The Prisoner of Zelda\\". * Justin Thyme is an American presenter on the TV21 channel who can always be relied upon to provide plot-related news bulletins. Voiced by Robbie Stevens, he appears in \\"Deadly Departed\\", \\"Clubbed to Death\\", and \\"Star Crossed\\". His name is a pun: Just in time. * Crusher was a bouncer at Dick Branston's club, and later filled much the same role at Starsons Studios. He is a huge fan of Kate Kestrel and frequently asks her to sign various parts of his body. Voiced by Robbie Stevens, he appears in \\"Clubbed to Death\\", \\"Sale of the Galaxy\\" and \\"Star Crossed\\". * Dick Branston was a morally bankrupt billionaire with an eye for the ladies and any questionable money-making scheme. After a plot to destroy his own nightclub went awry he later founded Global Rescue, an organisation dedicated to saving anyone in distress ‚Äì providing they can pay, of course. Voiced by Jeremy Hitchen, he appeared in \\"Clubbed to Death\\" and \\"Renta-hawks\\". * Kent Domuch is the \\"utterly unworthy\\" President of the Official Zelda Appreciation Society. Despite Zelda's frequent attempts to kill this fawning fan she somehow never quite manages to succeed. Voiced by Jeremy Hitchen, he appears in \\"Deadly Departed\\" and \\"My Enemy's Enemy\\". His name is a pun: Can't do much. * Honor Spot is a roving World Comms reporter who has appeared on both TV21 and FAB FM. Voiced by Beth Chalmers, she appears in \\"The Wrong Clone Number\\" and \\"Star Crossed\\". Her name is a pun: On the spot. * Dr. Chemi Rouge is a French NASA scientist and former flame of Tiger Ninestein's. She was in command of Lunarville 16 during the Watchdog affair and later transferred to Lunarville 8 to supervise the Ato-max project. Voiced by Denise Bryer, she appears in \\"Return to Sender\\" and \\"Enemies, Negotiation and Deceit\\".

The main conflict is between two powerful races, the Sartan and the Patryns, which branched off from humans following a nuclear/anti-matter holocaust. Centuries prior to the events of the series, the Sartan attempted to end the conflict by sundering the Earth into four elemental realms, and imprisoning the Patryns in a fifth prison world, the Labyrinth. The Sartan took up stewardship of the elemental realms, but soon mysteriously lost contact with each other and disappeared. Centuries later, a Patryn known as Xar escaped the Labyrinth, and started returning to the Labyrinth to rescue others. He learned how to access the other worlds and dreamed of freeing all his people from the Labyrinth and conquering the other worlds. The books follow the fiercely independent Haplo, a Patryn agent sent to scout the elemental worlds and throw them into chaos in preparation for his Lord's conquest of them. Weis and Hickman created five distinct fantasy worlds during the course of the series, along with developing the cultures of five major races: the unique Patryn and Sartan, and the common fantasy races of dwarves, elves, and humans.

Krynn is a world wholly distinct from Earth, unlike Tolkien's Middle-earth. Time travel itself was a science-fiction notion we applied to fantasy. We have even written fantasies taking place in the far future (The Death Gate Cycle)!\\" ::-- Tracy Hickman, The Annotated Dragonlance Legends pg. 458 Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman had finished their Dragonlance and Darksword series prior to The Death Gate Cycle, which may be considered their most ambitious work yet,Hickman, Tracy. \\"Tracy Hickman's Biography\\", 2002. Accessed April 26, 2007.Cassada, Jackie. (December 1989). Library Journal 114 (20): 177. as they created multiple fully realized and distinct worlds. The series also displayed Weis and Hickman's continued command of the fantasy genre.Green, Roland. (August 1994). Booklist vol 90 (22): 2030. As in their previous works, the authors continued to explore the theme of balance, and how the universe naturally works to correct imbalances.Hickman, Tracy, Denise Little and Margaret Weis (1999). Realms of Dragons: The Universes of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. HarperPrism, 14. . Unlike in Dragonlance, where the universe's balance was a greater force than even the gods, the existence of a god or gods in The Death Gate Cycle is unknown; a universal balance is the closest thing to divinity. Along a similar line, the authors continued to explore the theme of men becoming gods--in this case with the entire Patryn and Sartan races clamoring for that throne. Finally, as in both Dragonlance and the Darksword series, they explored the effects of sweeping changes to the fundamental nature of a world (in this case worlds) on both the day-to-day life and the fate of nations. Similar to the central concept of The Lord of the Rings, which J. R. R. Tolkien claimed was a translation of a real tome in his keeping (the Red Book of Westmarch), The Death Gate Cycle claims to be documentation of the events revolving around Death's Gate, authored after the fact by its primary characters. Even more than that, it is a scholarly document, with footnotes containing definitions of terms, references to past adventures and authorial asides. Each novel contains appendices giving further detail on various aspects of the story and its world, often summarizing (or occasionally laying the groundwork for) information related in the narrative proper. Finally, most of the novels also contain a musical score at the end, documenting a song (or sometimes a Sartan music-based rune-construct) featured in that particular volume. Worlds in the series :The Earth was destroyed. :Four worlds were created out of the ruin. Worlds for ourselves and the mensch: Air, Fire, Stone, Water. :Four Gates connect each world to the other: Arianus to Pryan to Abarrach to Chelestra. :A house of correction was built for our enemies: the Labyrinth. :The Labyrinth is connected to the other worlds through the Fifth Gate: the Nexus. :The Sixth Gate is the center, permitting entry: the Vortex. :And all was accomplished through the Seventh Gate. :The end was the beginning. ::-- Weis & Hickman, Into The Labyrinth pg. 9 =Earth= Prior to the main timeline of the series, life on Earth was nearly wiped out. Humans unleashed a nuclear war that killed millions, leaving the survivors struggling in the Age of Dust. Elves and dwarves, who had gone into hiding during the Renaissance, also suffered from what the humans had wrought with their science. In this chaos, a mutant strain of humans emerged who were once again able to feel the Wave--that which maintains balance and order in the universe. Recognizing its potential for magic, they developed runes to harness it. Originally, there was only one group, the Sartan. The Sartan used magic by drawing runes on the ground and in the air, augmented by singing and spoken word; they believed that their power gave them responsibility and stewardship over the lesser races, whom they called mensch. The Sartan believed in community, unity, and family, the basis of Order. However, in their conceit, they forgot about the Wave's tendency to balance everything. As the Sartan became too powerful, the Wave shifted and the Patryns came to be. Unlike the Sartan, the Patryns were loners, volatile and destructive; they believed that their powers gave them the right to do as they would. Patryns tattooed the runes on themselves and chose their name to mock the Sartan (see Languages below). These two races came into conflict over control and influence of the mensch. Both came to think of themselves as gods, though the Sartan believed themselves to be the \\"good guys\\". Eventually the Sartan, led by Samah and his Council of Seven, and driven by their own fear, undertook drastic measures. They broke the planet Earth into four separate worlds, each one focusing on a separate element (air, earth, fire, and water). This cataclysmic moment of destruction and re-creation is known as the Sundering. Millions of mensch died, with only chosen populations magically isolated for resettlement. The Patryns were captured and imprisoned in the Labyrinth which the Sartan created for their \\"rehabilitation\\". The Vortex (or the Sixth Gate) was the entry point to the Labyrinth, where the mensch were temporarily housed during the Sundering itself and where the captured Patryns were eventually placed. The books later reveal that certain members of the Sartan population had objected to The Sundering; these too were consigned to the Vortex and the Labyrinth. In the center of the Labyrinth was the Nexus, a paradise city for the Patryns to live in once they had become \\"civilized.\\" The Nexus, the Labyrinth, and the Vortex are arranged in concentric circles. All of these worlds are connected by Death's Gate, and smaller, one-way gates called Conduits which allow each elemental world to transmit materials to one another. The Sartan were left in stewardship of not just one world, but many, all designed to work in perfect harmony. The Plan of the Council of Seven was the grand construction of interconnected worlds, each with a specific function that fed into the whole. Almost immediately, however, things began to go wrong. =Chelestra, the world of water= Chelestra was to be the primary world where the mensch and Sartan would live. A great orb of liquid, the world was populated by great drifting beasts used as habitats for the mensch, with its own \\"Seasun\\" at the center. An appendix for Serpent Mage describes this liquid as not actually water, but a fluid which can be breathed through lungs and gills. Chelestra was also intended as a tremendous waste management and recycling plant, with the great floating habitat-beasts called \\"durnai\\" serving as biological recycling stations for the detritus from the other worlds. However, strange serpents, creatures of great power and corruption - that the Sartan had not created - began to appear. The Sartan could not account for their existence, but their danger was undeniable. Even worse, the emulsion fluid of Chelestra had a neutralizing effect on Sartan rune magic, rendering it and them utterly powerless. Surrounded by water that took away their power, no longer in control of the mensch, and faced with the serpents, the Sartan of Chelestra retreated into their capital. Samah, fearing what would happen if the serpents spread to the other worlds, shut Death's Gate, cutting communication between the worlds. The Sartan then placed themselves into a stasis sleep, expecting it to only last long enough for the other worlds to finish their parts of the grand plan and come help. This contributed to the disappearance of the Sartan from the mensch worlds, setting up the main series' events. =Arianus, the world of air= On Arianus, intended as an industrial and manufacturing world of floating continents, the Sartan had other problems. Cut off from communication with the other worlds (Chelestra specifically and the Council), the Sartan were slowly dying of some unknown cause, quickly becoming vastly outnumbered by the mensch. These Sartan also settled into hibernation, hoping for help from the other worlds. The Kicksey-winsey, a grand machine intended to align the floating continents and provide them with water (water being a direct byproduct of its production cycle), as well as manufacture all the processed goods desired by the other worlds, never became properly active. The dwarves, known on this world as Gegs, not truly understanding its purpose, effectively became slaves to the machine, worshiping it after a fashion as an artifact of their gods, the Mangers, (known to others as the Sartans) who had placed them there as its caretakers. The elves became tyrannical lords of much of the mid-realm through manipulation of the dwarves to obtain a monopoly on water, whilst constantly waging war with the humans. =Pryan, the world of fire= Pryan was created as a great inverted globe with four small suns at its center. It was to be the power plant and center for all four worlds, but it too fell into chaos. Great Citadels collected the energy from Pryan's four suns and beamed it through conduits to the other three worlds (the Colossi on Abarrach, the Kicksey-winsey on Arianus and the seasun on Chelestra). Covered entirely by miles-thick jungle (only the dwarves had ever seen the legendary 'ground') the Citadels were to be the bastions of civilization, where the Mensch would live a life of plenty and comfort. However, as with the other worlds, the Sartan mysteriously began to die. In fear, some citadels banished the mensch to the jungle. The Tytans, great blind giants of immense power created by the Sartan to manage the power systems of the citadels, were also banished because of fear they could no longer be controlled by the remaining Sartan. The Tytans went on to be an unstoppable terror as they searched for the citadels, trying to get home. =Abarrach, the world of stone= Finally, and most desperately, Abarrach was a huge volcanic asteroid-like world. The Sartan and mensch lived inside its honeycombed tunnels--designed to provide minerals and metals to the Kicksey-winsey--but they turned out to be loaded with poisonous volcanic fumes. The mensch were wiped out swiftly--the dwarves hung on the longest--and the poisons taxed the magic of the remaining Sartan to create breathable air. Huge columns called Colossi had been created by the Sartan to provide light and keep the world warm in the long run, but they began to fail almost immediately (because they did not receive the necessary energy from Pryan). With all the mensch dead and Sartan magic stretched to the limit, the Sartan of Abarrach turned to the forbidden arts of necromancy, using the corpses of the dead to supplement a lost workforce. While at the start it seemed a logical (if desperate) move that would help, it proved to be the most critical and tragic mistake of the whole Sartan race, as the dead eventually escaped from Sartan control. But the use of necromancy had an even worse result, one far more disastrous for the Sartan: For every life brought back, every soul prevented from passing on, another life ends untimely. For each dead body resurrected, another member of the species, somewhere, dies. The continuous restoration of dead Sartan on Abarrach resulted in the mass deaths among the Sartan populations of other worlds. Only on Chelestra, apparently due to either the Barrier protecting the Sartan city, or the properties of the water itself, did the Sartan survive relatively unscathed. =The Labyrinth= In the Labyrinth, the Sartan who should have been monitoring the prison realm either died or left. And without its caretakers, the Labyrinth slowly evolved from a temporary correctional facility into a sadistic and sentient prison. Instead of forcing a hard existence upon the Patryns and teaching them to care for others through relying on one another, it created a lethal, murderous hell where survival was the cruel torture of having hope dangled in your face, only to have it ripped away. Setting out on journeys that lasted generations, the Patryns traveled and fought in nomadic bands or simply alone. They became even more warlike as they fought against incredible odds to push farther and farther towards escape. Though some Patryns did eventually escape, they did so only by climbing on the corpses of those who had come before. Plans of conquest In the end the plan was a total collapse. All of the Sartan on Pryan and Arianus mysteriously died, save one. With no one left to go to their aid, the Sartan on Chelestra (unknowingly protected by their shield, and possibly the nullifying water) never awoke. Abarrach was a pale, dying shadow. In the meantime, the mensch lost all knowledge of their past; the lost Sartan of Arianus and Pryan became mythical god figures to the dwarves, elves and humans of those worlds. This left the imprisoned Patryns as the only ones who still remembered some of their heritage. After uncounted generations of struggle, Lord Xar became the first Patryn to escape from the Labyrinth. (He was not the first to escape, however. The books later reveal that Zifnab, a Sartan who had been cast into the Labyrinth for challenging the Sundering, apparently reached the Nexus well before him.) There, Lord Xar discovered a wealth of books (written by Zifnab in the Sartan language) that detailed events preceding and following the Sundering. From these, he devised a way to partially open Death's Gate and send through an emissary. Haplo, Lord Xar's favored servant, becomes this emissary; his two missions are to learn what has happened to the Sartan, and to subtly generate chaos among the mensch so that Lord Xar can come and \\"save\\" them. It is Xar's intention to rule all the four worlds, and Haplo is his willing servant. Races in the series :\\"Some years ago, I was working on a fantasy series called Death Gate with Margaret Weis. We needed two competing systems of magic that made sense. I remembered a saying of my old friend, Jeff Grubb. He defined quantum physics as \\"figures, figures, figures, figures, figures ... and then God does something ... figures, figures, figures, figures, figures.\\" So, in order to create a believable pair of magic systems, I researched what amounted to Newtonian versus Quantum mechanics and, later, competing visions of quantum theory. I read popular science books regarding Relativity, quantum mechanics, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, parallel universes and chaos theory. The results were a wonderful and sensible pair of magic systems that made sense because they were modeled on quantum and chaos theories.\\" ::-- Tracy Hickman, Hickman Newsletter #115 Drawing on these inspirations, Weis and Hickman set up the Patryns and Sartan as opposing pairs in many respects including the magical, and they portrayed the \\"mensch\\" races as having lesser (or no) magical abilities. The highest level of magic takes the form of this Patryn and Sartan \\"rune magic,\\" which alters reality based on possibility and whose operation is influenced by the aforementioned theories. The elves and humans use \\"physical\\" and \\"spiritual\\" magic of less potency, that operates directly on the world around it. =Patryns= Patryns are represented as having the same height and build as humans, but the current generations of the series are all in excellent physical shape due to the hardships of the Labyrinth. They are born with brown hair that turns white from the tips up. They are all possessed of excellent magical ability to varying degrees, also a necessity for their survival. All Patryns are capable of using rune magic, which manipulates the Wave of possibilities, allowing Patryns to view a myriad of possible outcomes and select one to occur. The more unlikely the possibility, however, the more difficult to conjure. Patryn use of runes is portrayed as less elegant than Sartan, as it relies more on physical representations such as their tattoos, the use of voice, and drawing the runes in air or on a surface. Patryn runes complement Sartan runes, and can sometimes be used to accomplish the same tasks. Patryns also tend to be loners, but are intensely passionate due to the hardships of the Labyrinth. They will aid one another without question, but generally put their own survival above that of others. Patryns who form groups tend to follow a single ruler, such as the Headman of tribes in the Labyrinth and Xar of the liberated Patryns. =Sartan= Sartan are also of the same height and build as humans, but unlike the Patryns, they have not been hardened by generations of violent life. Also unlike the Patryns they are born with white hair that turns brown from the tips up. All Sartan are capable of using rune magic. The Sartan use of runes is portrayed as more elegant than the Patryn, involving singing and dancing in prescribed tones and movements to affect the Wave. In some instances, Sartan inscribe runes, mainly to permanently enchant an object or location, such as when creating barred gateways or magical weapons that can then be used by mensch. Sartan runes complement Patryn runes, and can be used to accomplish the same tasks. Sartan tend to act as a community, making decisions as a group rather than as individuals, and they generally have a ruling Council. The Sartan on Abarrach, however, were more fractured due to their hardships. They are presented in contrast to other Sartan as having less magical talent, using much of their strength to survive. =Mensch races= Humans The humans of the series are standard Homo sapiens and are not presented as distinct parallels to existing modern-day nationalities. \\"Dark- skinned\\" humans populate Chelestra, while both dark-skinned and fair-skinned humans populate Arianus and Pryan. Humans are of standard height and physical prowess, and a small subset possess magical capability. Human magic is considered part of the Spiritual Masteries, tending towards \\"the emotional and mental manipulation of the world about the magician.\\" A human of sufficient magical talent can perform a variety of feats, including the manipulation of the elements, creating illusions, healing, compelling other life-forms, transforming shape and size, translocation and overcoming physical limitations such as gravity. While some magicians can mentally construct their magic rather than speaking it, most need to use physical gestures and in some instances physical objects or incantations to perform their magic. The spiritual nature of human magic also ties in with the theme of balance present throughout the series. Humans, especially when compared to elves, are \\"lacking\\" in their connection to the natural world and spirituality and their magical skills serve to balance this deficit. Elves Elves are generally taller and more slender than humans and have a greatly extended lifespan. Their longer lives tend to breed a lack of urgency in their outlook, sometimes problematic in dealings with the comparatively impatient humans. Elven magic is considered part of the Physical Masteries, which \\"tend to use and make use of physical objects in the world about the wizard.\\"Weis, Margaret and Tracy Hickman. Dragon Wing, appendix. For instance, this allows for the creation of \\"smart\\" self-targeting arrows, flying dragonships, magical submarines, protective charms against human magics, fabric as hard as steel and other mechanical devices with enhanced capabilities. As with human magic, elven magic is used to balance the elven deficiencies in mechanical, physical, and technical fields. They can also weave magical messages into songs. Elves must both speak and gesture to cast their magic, and the magic contained in songs can be triggered by anyone capable of singing it since the magic is not dependent on a wizard, thus making it possible for humans to trigger elven magic in this form. In Dragon Wing, this explains how humans have been able to use songs to trigger a nostalgia so intense that the elves of Arianus have formed an open rebellion against their ruler. In contrast, the Kenkari, an isolated group of powerful elven magi on Arianus, also employ a very specialised form of magic based on the spirit which allows them to communicate with the souls of others, living or dead and on one occasion have been shown to change their forms into their order's symbol; the butterfly, which is a glaring exception to the mechanical focus. However, this can possibly be explained by their use of song in these communications, as well as their use of a special box to transport souls and a cathedral designed to contain the captured souls. Dwarves Dwarves are short and stocky compared to the other races, such that humans and elves would have to go down on one knee to converse with a dwarf eye-to-eye. In fact, doing so is considered a mark of respect towards a dwarf. As is typical in portrayals of dwarves, they prefer to live in dark, underground areas, and they also possess an innate sense of direction superior to that of humans or elves. Dwarves have no magical abilities of their own, although certain dwarves of Pryan make very rudimentary use of Sartan magic through triggering its representations in songs and runes carved onto amulets. On Arianus, they are known as \\"Gegs\\". Zifnab and related characters The character Zifnab is similar to the character Fizban from Weis and Hickman's Dragonlance novels. Zifnab makes a few references to Fizban during the series (when he's asked for his name he said \\"Fiz..., no can't use that one\\", or such as the importance of a Wizard's Hat) and he is described with a similar appearance. He makes references to the Pern series of books, The Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, Star Wars, Star Trek, James Bond, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Arthurian legend, the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and soul music; within the context of the books, these are historic references to the former Earth. The character type appears again in a similar capacity in the Starshield novels, where the parallel character is known as Zanfib. Are Zifnab and Fizban the same person? The simplest (and legal) answer, in Hickman's own words, is always: \\"The answer is that Fizban is a crazed wizard owned by TSR under copyright, while Zifnab is a completely different crazed wizard owned by Margaret and I. Incidentally, neither Fizban nor Zifnab have any relationship whatsoever to Zanfib‚Äîa crazed wizard from our Starshield series. I hope I have cleared this up once and for all.\\" annotation on p 318 The Annotated Dragonlance Chronicles 1999 As to the actual nature of Zifnab within the world of the Death Gate Cycle, Hickman wrote: \\"Zifnab was actually a Sartan wizard who opposed the council's decision to sunder the world. Zifnab is not a god ... indeed, he is actually a chosen and blessed subject of the dragon-avatars of the Death Gate series.\\" So why does Zifnab seem, at times, to act just like Fizban? How can he remember Tanis and Raistlin, and why does he nearly call himself Fizban? Hickman: \\"I like to think that Zifnab is very well read.\\" And so, as far as we know, that is all there is to it: the crazy old wizard was a fan of Dragonlance, as well as, apparently, Tolkien and James Bond. The rest is purely speculation. Hickman has said that the Zifnab/Fizban/Zanfib character is like him in that they are similarly misunderstood and possessed of great depth, and so the character type continues appearing in his works with Weis.Hickman, Tracy, Denise Little and Margaret Weis (1999). Realms of Dragons: The Universes of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. HarperPrism, 56. . On multiple occasions, Hickman has jokingly suggested that the three characters are distinctly different because they are separately owned and appear in separate series.Hickman, Tracy. \\"Top 10 FAQ\\" . Accessed September 15, 2007. \\"Zifnab,\\" \\"Fizban,\\" and \\"Zanfib\\" are anagrams. Language usage The name \\"Haplo\\" is said to mean \\"single\\" in the Patryn language, and \\"haplo-\\" is a Greek root word with the same meaning. Haplo and Marit's daughter is named \\"Rue\\", which in English is a verb meaning regret. The term \\"mensch\\" is used by both Sartan and Patryns to refer to humans, elves, and dwarves, both collectively (all three races) and individually (one particular mensch person). Mensch is the German word for \\"human,\\" but it is used in the books as a derogatory term. The names \\"Sartan\\" and \\"Patryn\\" are defined in the books as \\"Those Who Bring Back Light,\\" and \\"Those Who Return to Darkness\\" respectively. A footnote suggests that the Lord of the Nexus took the name \\"Xar\\" from the Russian word tsar, which itself is a corruption of Caesar. The Patryn city of Abri takes its name from the French word for \\"shelter\\". Game adaptations Legend Entertainment released a computer adventure game called Death Gate based on the series. The game is based roughly on the first four books, although at the end it also contains an interpretation of the final confrontation from The Seventh Gate.

He was closely involved with the Birmingham Arts Lab of the mid-to-late 1970s, and with the British underground comics scene of the 1970s and 1980s. His many comic strips and graphic novels have been translated into numerous languages. His earliest strips in the 1970s appeared in such British small press comics as Graphixus, Moon Comix, Yikes, Animal Bite Comix, No Ducks, Phobos, Streetcomix, Free Comix, Warrior and Fish. A trip to the US put Emerson in touch with the underground comix publisher Rip Off Press, which published his Thunderdogs title; while Don and Maggie Thompson included him in their mini-comic series, for which he created Calculus Cat. Emerson's art also appeared in the US underground/alternative anthologies Commies from Mars and Eclipse Monthly. Dogman, and Large Cow Comix (a five issue series with separate subtitles) were all Emerson work cover to cover, but it was Knockabout Comics, a British comic book-sized, and later album-sized, anthology that featured some of Emerson's most notable strips, including the characters Alan Rabbit, Calculus Cat, Max Zillion & Alto Ego, Pusspuss, Momo and Fuzi, Charlie Chirp, plus the one-shot stories \\"Cakes And Bricks,\\" \\"The Dentist,\\" and \\"Mouth City\\". The latter two stories spawned a series called Citymouth, and later a collected volume. Square-bound books written by others, such as You Are Maggie Thatcher and Hard To Swallow, showcase Emerson strips and illustrations throughout. In Outrageous Tales From the Old Testament he tackled a version of the Book of Leviticus written by Alan Moore, and in The Seven Deadly Sins, depicted \\"Envy\\". For the DC Comics imprint Factoid Books, in the 1990s, he did biographical comics on everything from Erich von Stroheim to Prince Charles and Princess Diana. These appeared in The Big Book Of series. For dozens of issues of the British underground Brain Damage, he created \\"Arsover Tit\\". The Emerson graphic novels Lady Chatterley's Lover, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Casanova's Last Stand and other adaptations of classic novels and tales have been sold in numerous countries, and translated into several different languages. For over 30 years Hunt Emerson's strips and illustrations have graced the pages of Fortean Times, a magazine of occult and unexplained phenomena, while his pornographically humorous Firkin the Cat (written by Tym Manley) has appeared in hundreds of Fiesta magazines. He drew the cover design for Terry McCann's 1975 album Stand Back It's Rent-a-Crowd. He designed the 'Beat Girl' icon for Birmingham band The Beat. and painted a mural of the band, which was used as cover art for the band's second album Wha'ppen?. In 2016, he designed the Walsall Silver Thread Tapestries. Emerson drew and created \\"Ratz\\" for The Beano, a strip about mean rats in a sewer. In 2002‚Äì2007, he drew Little Plum for that comic. In March 2009, he revived the \\"Fred's Bed\\" strip.

She is a former CEO of Paramount Pictures, and when she was the president of production at 20th Century Fox, she was the first woman to head a Hollywood movie studio.Desilu was almost entirely a television studio rather than a movie studio. In 1996, she became the first woman to be named Pioneer of the Year by the Foundation of the Motion Picture Pioneers, and she was the first female movie studio head to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1999, she was appointed to the University of California Board of Regents. In 2005, she became the first female movie studio head to place hand and foot prints at the Grauman's Chinese Theater. In 2001, she was named one of the 30 most powerful women in America by Ladies' Home Journal, and The Hollywood Reporter named her fourth on its Power 100 list in 2003. Personal life Lansing was born Sherry Lee Duhl in Chicago, Illinois on July 31, 1944. Her mother, Margaret \\"Margot\\" Heimann, fled from Nazi Germany in 1937 at the age of 17. Her father, David Duhl, was a real-estate investor who died when she was nine. Her mother remarried and died in 1984 from ovarian cancer. She was raised in a Jewish household. Lansing attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and graduated in 1962. In 1966, she earned a Bachelor of Science degree at Northwestern University, where she was a member of Sigma Delta Tau sorority. Lansing married Academy Award- winning director William Friedkin on July 6, 1991; he had previously been married to French film star Jeanne Moreau, actress Lesley-Anne Down and Kelly Lange. By her current marriage, Lansing has two stepsons, Jack and Cedric. Lansing and former MGM studio head James T. Aubrey were struck by a car while crossing Wilshire Boulevard in the mid-1970s. Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches for a year and a half. Aubrey nursed her back to health. \\"He came every day. He would say, 'You're not going to limp.' My own mother and father couldn't have given me more support,\\" she told Variety in 2004. Career Lansing is a former mathematics teacher, model, and then pursued an acting career (appearing in two films released in 1970, Loving and Rio Lobo, starring John Wayne) but, dissatisfied with her own acting skills, she decided to learn more about the film industry from the ground up.\\"Lansing, Sherry (Lee).\\"Current Biography 1981.The H.W. Wilson Company New York.1981.p. 265. She took a job with MGM as head script reader and worked on two successful films, The China Syndrome and Kramer vs. Kramer, both released in 1979. Lansing's work at MGM eventually led, after a stint at Columbia Pictures, to an appointment with 20th Century Fox in 1980, at age 35, as the first female production president of a major studio. She resigned in December 1982 and became a partner with Stanley R. Jaffe to form Jaffe-Lansing Productions based at Paramount Pictures. The company released a consistent string of minor hits through Paramount before achieving box-office success with Fatal Attraction in 1987, for which Jaffe and Lansing received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture the following year. The partnership produced The Accused (1988) starring Jodie Foster. It dealt with the horrors of rape and its impact on a victim's life. The film featured a graphic rape scene and was highly controversial when released. Made with a small budget of $6 million, it grossed over $37 million worldwide, becoming a box office hit as well as receiving critical praise with Foster scoring the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1992, she was offered the chairmanship of Paramount Pictures' Motion Picture Group. During her tenure at Paramount, the studio enjoyed its longest and most successful string of releases since the 1930s. Under Lansing, the studio produced such hits as Forrest Gump, Braveheart, and what was, at the time, history's highest-grossing film ‚Äì Titanic (the latter two with Fox). Six of the ten highest-grossing Paramount films were released during her tenure which included three Academy Awards for Best Picture. As studio chief, she focused on bottom-line cost rather than market share, preferring to take fewer risks and make lower-budget films than other studios. Viacom (which purchased Paramount in 1994) decided to split the company into two parts in 2004 and Lansing stepped down at the end of that year after an almost unprecedented twelve-year tenure atop Hollywood's legendary \\"Best Show in Town.\\" She is a Regent of the University of California. She sits on the boards of the American Red Cross, The Carter Center, DonorsChoose, Qualcomm, Teach for America, The American Association for Cancer Research, the Lasker Foundation and Friends of Cancer Research. In 2005, she created The Sherry Lansing Foundation which is dedicated to raising awareness and funds for cancer research. She is a recipient of UCLA Anderson School of Management's highest honor-the Exemplary Leadership in Management (ELM) Award. In 2007, she received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her work in cancer research at the 79th Academy Awards. The award was presented to her by Tom Cruise, her longtime friend and business partner. In 2011, Lansing pledged $5 million to University of Chicago Laboratory Schools to build a new arts wing, including a 250-seat performance venue. , Lansing was a member of the board of directors of the Dole Food Company. Beginning in 2012, she has also served as a member of the board of directors for the W. M. Keck Foundation. In May 2018, Lansing joined the board of directors at The Scripps Research Institute.

He was born on 18 October 1903 and was the only child of A. McFarlane, OBE. His father was a civil servant in the Admiralty and the young McFarlane's childhood was an unhappy one. This may have led to the deep melancholy that seemed to pervade much of his adult life. His family sent him to public school at Dulwich College as a day-boy. McFarlane did not particularly like the atmosphere of the public school. In 1922 he earned a scholarship to read history at Exeter College, Oxford. His tutor during these years was C. T. Atkinson. Following the completion of his DPhil on the loans of Cardinal Beaufort to the English Crown (September 1927),McFarlane, K. B. The Nobility of Late Medieval England, Oxford 1973, viii; \\"Introduction\\" by Gerald Harriss McFarlane became a fellow of Magdalen College, where he remained for the rest of his life. Many of his colleagues and students found him difficult to approach, but to those who could break through the facade he became a great and true friend. McFarlane also found, through the help of his great friend Helena Wright and her family, a home and a family of sorts. In Wright's house he found that he could be himself and find refuge from the daily grind of the University and a place of joy. McFarlane never married. His most important contribution to the field was his revision of the understanding of late medieval feudal relationships, known as \\"bastard feudalism\\". The old consensus, promoted primarily by Bishop Stubbs, was that payment for service in feudal relationships had promoted greed and civil strife. McFarlane, however, pointed out the adhesive effect of such a system, and other forms of patronage, as a field of common interest for the Crown and the landed aristocracy. According to Christine Carpenter in \\"Wars of the Roses ‚Äì Politics and the constitution in England c. 1473‚Äì1509\\" (Cambridge University Press 1997): \\"It is hard to exaggerate the impact of McFarlane's work, especially at Oxford where he taught. A whole generation of students there was inspired to work on what had been a very neglected century; nearly all the political historians of fourteenth and fifteenth century England today, including the present writer, are, academically speaking, the children or grandchildren, even great grandchildren, of McFarlane\\". She also described him as being responsible for a \\"paradigm shift\\". In more recent debate, it has been pointed out that McFarlane created a \\"paradoxical metaphor ‚Äì the image of a polluted, dirty, as it were contaminated phenomenon ‚Äì of the feudalism\\" which led to follow-up terms as it was a late-medieval \\"bastard urbanism\\".Hannes Obermair (2007). \\"'Bastard Urbanism'? Past Forms of Cities in the Alpine Area of Tyrol- Trentino\\". Concilium Medii Aevi, 10, pp. 53‚Äì76, esp. pp. 59‚Äì60. While house- hunting before retirement he was \\"ambushed by a stroke which killed him instantly\\". Although his scholarship and methods have had great influence on later historians, McFarlane did not publish widely in his own lifetime. The main sources for his scholarship are the book Lancastrian Kings and Lollard Knights, his Ford Lectures from 1953 published in 1980 as The Nobility of Later Medieval England, and the essays and shorter articles published by his student G. L. Harriss in 1981 under the title England in the Fifteenth Century. Much of his influence on historiography is the result of his DPhil students, who held posts in many British universities. Letters to Friends, 1940‚Äì1966, edited by G. L. Harriss, contains a selection from the large collection of correspondence deposited with Magdalen College and published privately through the college in 1997. The great bulk of McFarlane's correspondence remains unpublished. References Sources *The McFarlane legacy: studies in late medieval politics and society, edited by R.H. Britnell and A.J. Pollard.

Since accurate duplication of the genome is critical to successful cell division, the processes that occur during S-phase are tightly regulated and widely conserved. Regulation Entry into S-phase is controlled by the G1 restriction point (R), which commits cells to the remainder of the cell-cycle if there is adequate nutrients and growth signaling. This transition is essentially irreversible; after passing the restriction point, the cell will progress through S-phase even if environmental conditions become unfavorable. Accordingly, entry into S-phase is controlled by molecular pathways that facilitate a rapid, unidirectional shift in cell state. In yeast, for instance, cell growth induces accumulation of Cln3 cyclin, which complexes with the cyclin dependent kinase CDK2. The Cln3-CDK2 complex promotes transcription of S-phase genes by inactivating the transcriptional repressor Whi5. Since upregulation of S-phase genes drive further suppression of Whi5, this pathway creates a positive feedback loop that fully commits cells to S-phase gene expression. A remarkably similar regulatory scheme exists in mammalian cells. Mitogenic signals received throughout G1-phase cause gradual accumulation of cyclin D, which complexes with CDK4/6. Active cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex induces release of E2F transcription factor, which in turn initiates expression of S-phase genes. Several E2F target genes promote further release of E2F, creating a positive feedback loop similar to the one found in yeast. DNA replication Steps in DNA synthesis Throughout M phase and G1 phase, cells assemble inactive pre- replication complexes (pre-RC) on replication origins distributed throughout the genome. During S-phase, the cell converts pre-RCs into active replication forks to initiate DNA replication. This process depends on the kinase activity of Cdc7 and various S-phase CDKs, both of which are upregulated upon S-phase entry. Activation of the pre-RC is a closely regulated and highly sequential process. After Cdc7 and S-phase CDKs phosphorylate their respective substrates, a second set of replicative factors associate with the pre-RC. Stable association encourages MCM helicase to unwind a small stretch of parental DNA into two strands of ssDNA, which in turn recruits replication protein A (RPA), an ssDNA binding protein. RPA recruitment primes the replication fork for loading of replicative DNA polymerases and PCNA sliding clamps. Loading of these factors completes the active replication fork and initiates synthesis of new DNA. Complete replication fork assembly and activation only occurs on a small subset of replication origins. All eukaryotes possess many more replication origins than strictly needed during one cycle of DNA replication. Redundant origins may increase the flexibility of DNA replication, allowing cells to control the rate of DNA synthesis and respond to replication stress.  Histone synthesis  Since new DNA must be packaged into nucleosomes to function properly, synthesis of canonical (non- variant) histone proteins occurs alongside DNA replication. During early S-phase, the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex phosphorylates NPAT, a nuclear coactivator of histone transcription. NPAT is activated by phosphorylation and recruits the Tip60 chromatin remodeling complex to the promoters of histone genes. Tip60 activity removes inhibitory chromatin structures and drives a three to ten-fold increase in transcription rate. In addition to increasing transcription of histone genes, S-phase entry also regulates histone production at the RNA level. Instead of polyadenylated tails, canonical histone transcripts possess a conserved 3\` stem loop motif that selective binds to Stem Loop Binding Protein (SLBP). SLBP binding is required for efficient processing, export, and translation of histone mRNAs, allowing it to function as a highly sensitive biochemical \\"switch\\". During S-phase, accumulation of SLBP acts together with NPAT to drastically increase the efficiency of histone production. However, once S-phase ends, both SLBP and bound RNA are rapidly degraded. This immediately halts histone production and prevents a toxic buildup of free histones.  Nucleosome replication  alt= Free histones produced by the cell during S-phase are rapidly incorporated into new nucleosomes. This process is closely tied to the replication fork, occurring immediately in ‚Äúfront‚Äù and ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the replication complex. Translocation of MCM helicase along the leading strand disrupts parental nucleosome octamers, resulting in the release of H3-H4 and H2A-H2B subunits. Reassembly of nucleosomes behind the replication fork is mediated by chromatin assembly factors (CAFs) that are loosely associated with replication proteins. Though not fully understood, the reassembly does not appear to utilize the semi-conservative scheme seen in DNA replication. Labeling experiments indicate that nucleosome duplication is predominantly conservative. The paternal H3-H4 core nucleosome remains completely segregated from newly synthesized H3-H4, resulting in the formation of nucleosomes that either contain exclusively old H3-H4 or exclusively new H3-H4. ‚ÄúOld‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù histones are assigned to each daughter strand semi-randomly, resulting in equal division of regulatory modifications.  Reestablishment of chromatin domains  Immediately after division, each daughter chromatid only possesses half the epigenetic modifications present in the paternal chromatid. The cell must use this partial set of instructions to re-establish functional chromatin domains before entering mitosis. For large genomic regions, inheritance of old H3-H4 nucleosomes is sufficient for accurate re-establishment of chromatin domains. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and several other histone- modifying complexes can \\"copy\\" modifications present on old histones onto new histones. This process amplifies epigenetic marks and counters the dilutive effect of nucleosome duplication. However, for small domains approaching the size of individual genes, old nucleosomes are spread too thinly for accurate propagation of histone modifications. In these regions, chromatin structure is probably controlled by incorporation of histone variants during nucleosome reassembly. The close correlation seen between H3.3/H2A.Z and transcriptionally active regions lends support to this proposed mechanism. Unfortunately, a causal relationship has yet to be proven.  DNA damage checkpoints  During S-phase, the cell continuously scrutinizes its genome for abnormalities. Detection of DNA damage induces activation of three canonical S-phase \\"checkpoint pathways\\" that delay or arrest further cell cycle progression: # The Replication Checkpoint detects stalled replication forks by integrating signals from RPA, ATR Interacting Protein (ATRIP), and RAD17. Upon activation, the replication checkpoint upregulates nucleotide biosynthesis and blocks replication initiation from unfired origins. Both of these processes contribute to rescue of stalled forks by increasing the availability of dNTPs. # The S-M Checkpoint blocks mitosis until the entire genome has been successfully duplicated. This pathway induces arrest by inhibiting the Cyclin-B-CDK1 complex, which gradually accumulates throughout the cell cycle to promote mitotic entry. # The intra-S Phase Checkpoint detects Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) through activation of ATR and ATM kinases. In addition to facilitating DNA repair, active ATR and ATM stalls cell cycle progression by promoting degradation of CDC25A, a phosphatase that removes inhibitory phosphate residues from CDKs. Homologous recombination, an accurate process for repairing DNA double-strand breaks, is most active in S phase, declines in G2/M and is nearly absent in G1 phase. In addition to these canonical checkpoints, recent evidence suggests that abnormalities in histone supply and nucleosome assembly can also alter S-phase progression. Depletion of free histones in Drosophila cells dramatically prolongs S-phase and causes permanent arrest in G2-phase. This unique arrest phenotype is not associated with activation of canonical DNA damage pathways, indicating that nucleosome assembly and histone supply may be scrutinized by a novel S-phase checkpoint.

The name Leen developed through various renderings of the Celtic word meaning \\"lake\\" or \\"pool\\" (Llyn in modern Welsh). Some of the surrounding villages derived their name from the River Leen. Lenton, ton being the Saxon word for \\"village\\"; and Linby, by being the Danish equivalent of ton. Course The Leen rises as a series of springs at the foot of the Robin Hood Hills just outside Annesley. It then flows through the grounds and lakes of Newstead Abbey, passing Papplewick and on through Bestwood Country Park, following the route of the Leen Valley into suburban and urban Nottingham. Within the city it flows through the centre of Bulwell, and passes Basford where it is joined by the Day Brook. The Leen then flows through Radford, and Lenton before passing under the Nottingham Canal and flowing on to join the River Trent next to Riverside Way in The Meadows. History From Lenton onwards the course of the Leen has been quite radically altered on a number of occasions, although ironically the river's present course probably follows a route close to its original natural course. The first change to the river's course came in the late eleventh or early twelfth centuries, when the river was diverted to pass beneath the cliff on which Nottingham Castle was situated before flowing into the Trent near Trent Bridge, thus providing the town of Nottingham with a more plentiful supply of water. The next change came with the opening of the Nottingham Canal, which in some places occupied the course of the Leen, with the river being diverted along the route of the present Canal Street. This stretch was eventually culverted in 1863 by the Nottingham Borough Engineer, Marriott Ogle Tarbotton. Further changes came with the construction of Castle Boulevard along the foot of the Castle cliff in 1884. With insufficient room for river, canal and road, the river was diverted into the canal at Lenton and the road built on the course of the former river. After flowing some distance along the canal, the river passed over a small weir into the Tinker‚Äôs Leen (where the modern Courts complex is now situated) and so into the Trent just downstream of Trent Bridge. However over time, and as the river's catchment area became more built up with faster run-off times, flooding became a problem, with particularly heavy flooding in 1960. By this stage, the main line of the canal between Lenton and Langley Mill had been abandoned, although the stretch through Nottingham remains in use as part of the Trent navigation. This flooding led to a further diversion, which would largely divert the river back to its original pre-eleventh-century course. The river was first diverted into the southernmost section of the abandoned canal, between Derby Road and the operational canal at Lenton. It was then taken under that canal in a syphon, before entering a brand new channel that took it to join the Trent at its nearest point. Recent developments Nottingham City Council planning guidanceNottingham City Council Local Plan 2005, Chapter 9 and best practice from the Environment AgencyEnvironment Agency Policy Regarding Culverts is now to remove culverts, which are expensive to maintain and can cause flooding when they are blocked or damaged. As a result, a number of developments along the course of the Leen now open up previously culverted stretches of the waterway. A new Tesco development in Bulwell town centre, which received planning permission in 2008, will remove the culvert under the former Kwik Save supermarket.Nottingham City Council planning application 08/02642/PFUL3 In Radford, a new student village at Chettle's Yard will open up a long stretch of the river parallel to the railway line. And the eastern part of the University of Nottingham's Jubilee Campus opens up a section of the river's urban route through Lenton, a small lake having been created to the rear of the Sir Colin Campbell building, adjacent to the concrete channel (through which the Leen still flows) that was originally built to prevent the flooding of the now-demolished Raleigh cycle factory. The river then passes through several industrial units and under Triumph Road, before re-appearing behind the Nottingham Emergency Medical Services centre (the old AA building) on Derby Road. The Leen is sometimes mistakenly believed to pass through the main part of the Jubilee Campus, but the lake and other water features in that area are artificial in nature.

On Saturday, November 20, in order to put the FY 2005 (October 1, 2004 - September 30, 2005) appropriations bill to a close, the Senate had to quickly review the 3,016-page appropriation bill containing \\"complex and controversial matters\\" which included nine bills, only two of which had been debated in the Senate and a conference report with 32 unrelated provisions that the Senate had never considered.November 20, 2004 to December 20, 2004 The bill was passed by the House in an emergency session on Saturday, November 20, even though the members were not aware of the specific wording of the bill. CAA consisting of eleven Divisions H.R. 4818, approved December 8, was assigned Public Law No. 108-447. On Friday, November 19, it was announced that the United States government was in danger of running out of money by midnight that night. Scope Among the spending cuts made were several of President Bush's initiatives. These included funding to AmeriCorp, and a rejection of his plans to build up the United States nuclear weapons stores. The bill funded a dozen agencies including the Departments of Labor, Agriculture, Treasury, State and Justice. However, its most major change was to raise the debt limit of the Federal Government. By Monday, November 21, the bill reached the Senate where it was revealed by Democratic Senator Kent Conrad that among the many overlooked provisions, the bill gave two committee chairmen, the chairmen of the House or Senate Committee on Appropriations, the ability to access anyone's tax returns. In response, Rep. Ernest Istook of Oklahoma, who was in charge of this section of the bill, said the provision was intended to \\"include visiting and inspecting the huge IRS processing centers but not inspecting tax returns.\\" He also stated adamantly that there is no conspiracy. Opponents claimed this was evidence of a real problem in the legislative system and it must be required that bills must be reviewed in their entirety before they are passed. The Senate refused to send the bill to the president until the tax provision was changed or removed. It was decided that an already existing provision would fund the country until a minimalistic session was held on December 6 when the house would vote to remove the language. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said \\"accountability will be carried out\\" for whoever put the provision in. Also, buried within the bill was a provision that stated doctors, hospitals, and clinics no longer have to offer abortion as an alternative to birth control undermining the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade.House report By the middle of the following week, on November 24, more and more of the actual text of the bill was known. It included such provisions as $335,000 to protect North Dakota sunflowers from blackbirds, $2.3 million for an animal waste management research lab in Bowling Green, Kentucky, $50,000 to control wild hogs in Missouri, and $443,000 to develop salmon-fortified baby food, $131 million for abstinence programs in public schools, and most notably $350,000 for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to develop music education programs. Sen. Richard Shelby a Republican from Alabama and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, managed to win several dozen special items for his state, more than anyone else.

Located opposite Mumbai's Girgaon Chowpatty, the college building was constructed in 1889 and designed by John Adams in the domestic Victorian Gothic style. It is listed as a Grade III heritage structure in the city.As of 2011, the college offered a variety of subjects for both higher secondary and undergraduate students which include University Aided courses for the Arts and the Sciences as well as self- financed courses such as Mass Media, Information Technology, Management Studies, Biotechnology, Electronics & Computer Science. History Wilson College, 1893 Wilson College (20th century) John Wilson, D.D., F.R.S founder of the college The Wilson College was founded by the Indian missionary Rev. John Wilson, in 1832. Beginning as Ambroli English School in Girgaum, Mumbai, it later saw several changes of sites and names, eventually being called the Wilson School. The collegiate section, from which Wilson College evolved, came about in 1836. Soon after their arrival in Mumbai in February 1829, Wilson and his wife Margaret Wilson began studying the local Marathi language. Margaret started a school for girls in 1829 at Ambroli House in Girgaum at Mumbai, with Marathi being the chief medium of instruction and learning. An English boarding school was opened in 1832, which later became the St. Columba School. The Ambroli English School is the direct forerunner of the present college. On 14 December 1861, the collegiate section of Wilson's institution under the name of Free General Assembly's Institution became the first privately owned, non-government institution to be affiliated to the university.The Wilsonian. 1942. In 1952, the management of the college came under an autonomous Board of Governors in India. Since 1963, the college functions under the management of John Wilson Education Society.

The WCNC holds the distinction of traversing through its camps the northern-, eastern- and southernmost corners of India between 2005 and 2010 alone. Camp fees are highly subsidised to enable students of all economic backgrounds to attend and, at times, free-ships are awarded to deserving students. Another significant feature of these camps is that they are organised entirely by the staff and students. Conservation activities of the club include organising tree plantation projects, snake shows for students, developing educational material and an annual theme-based exhibition, which runs under the initiative of active WCNC members and is supported by student volunteers from across the college. The WCNC is also known for its library, which was set up through the efforts of Prof. Vakharia.

Campuses =Bogot√° branch= The University City of Bogot√° (), also known as the White City (), is the flagship University campus. It is located in the Teusaquillo locality, northwest of the historical center. It is also the largest campus in Colombia, with an area of and a constructed area of , making it an ample campus with several green areas, open spaces, and pedestrian paths. Among its buildings there are 17 which have been declared national monuments and, as a whole, it is a representation of the last 60 years of architecture in Colombia. Central square, Bogota campusThe campus was designed by German educationalist Fritz Karsen and architect Leopold Rother, both refugees from Nazi Germany. Construction began in 1935, under the government of Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo. It is organized into an ellipse, divided into five parts, each containing one academic division and its respective departments. From an aerial view, the shape of an owl can be seen, emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. The buildings were constructed as prismatic blocks, and painted white, in order to give an austere and clean look. Some landmarks in the campus are the Le√≥n de Greiff Auditorium, and the Francisco de Paula Santander Plaza, also known unofficially as the \\"Central Plaza\\" or the \\"Ch√© Plaza\\", in honor of Ernesto el Ch√© Guevara. The campus has its own stadium, where matches for the Colombian Professional Football are sometimes held. =Medell√≠n branch= The National University of Colombia, Medell√≠n has two campuses, the Central Campus and Robledo Campus, where 10,447 students study.

This site offers 26 undergraduate and 73 graduate courses: 15 PhDs, 28 Masters, and 29 specializations. Its history has given Medell√≠n a peculiar character, since it was formed, as with most universities, from the classical degrees of Law, Medicine, Arts and Sciences. The site commenced with engineering programs, which is why Medell√≠n today has the highest number of engineering programs (17) among all National University of Colombia campuses and in Colombia in general. Central Campus: Located northwest of the city center, between Cerro Ecoparque the Flyer and the Medell√≠n River. Since 1938, it has been the headquarters of the National University of Colombia in Medellin, when the School of Tropical Agriculture (now the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences) joined the University.

He was a layman of the Protestant Church of Nauru during his youth, and became assistant to the missionary Rev. Phillip Delaporte to be his assistant. In 1917, he was chosen to travel to the United States by Rev Delaporte to translate the Bible into the Nauruan language. To finance the travel, Detudamo needed US$500, which he raised through Nauruan donations. His translation was carried out with the help of Rev Delaporte, a German-American missionary. Detudamo returned to Nauru in 1921. In 1938, he tried to reform the Nauruan language by making it more understandable for Europeans and Americans. However, his reforms were not widely adopted and today the old orthography continues to be more common. In November 1930 Detudamo was appointed Head Chief of Nauru by Administrator William Augustin Newman following the death of Daimon.\\"High Chief of Nauru\\", Pacific Islands Monthly, November 1930, p7 He held the office until 1942 when Japan invaded and occupied the island.

On 31 January 1946 he returned to Nauru and was duly re-elected to the position of Head Chief. Following the introduction of a Nauru Local Government Council in 1951 Detudamo was elected as a councillor for the Districts of Denigomodu, Nibok, Uaboe, and Baitsi.

Biography Gustave Le Gray was born on 30 August 1820 in Villiers-le-Bel, Val-d'Oise. He was an only child, and his parents encouraged him to become a solicitor's clerk, but from a young age he aspired to be an artist. He was originally trained as a painter, studying under Fran√ßois-√âdouard Picot and Paul Delaroche. His parents financed a trip to Switzerland and Italy so that he could study art abroad, and he lived in Italy between 1843-1846 and painted portraits and scenes of the countryside. In 1844, he met and married Palmira Maddalena Gertrude Leonardi (born 23 March 1823), a laundress who he had six children with, although only two survived into adulthood.https://books.google.com/books?id=7bfzMQWVlkMC&pg;=PA329&lpg;=PA329&dq;=Palmira+Maddalena+Gertrude+Leonardi,&source;=bl&ots;=heRMy3vVWN&sig;=ACfU3U0EALCnvO9OnsvIxW5ujtEclU5nEw&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjiqcLtsaLsAhWjiK0KHb47CdYQ6AEwAXoECAwQAQ Le Gray exhibited his paintings at the salon in 1848 and 1853. He then crossed over to photography in the early years of its development. He made his first daguerreotypes by 1847. His early photographs included portraits; scenes of nature such as Fontainebleau Forest; and buildings such as ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley.Janis, Eugenia Parry. Gustave Le Gray.

In 1851, he became one of the first five photographers hired for the Missions H√©liographiques to document French monuments and buildings. In that same year he helped found the Soci√©t√© H√©liographique, the \\"first photographic organization in the world.\\" Le Gray published a treatise on photography, which went through four editions, in 1850, 1851, 1852, and 1854. In 1855, Le Gray opened a \\"lavishly furnished\\" studio. At that time, becoming progressively the official photographer of Napoleon III, he became a successful portraitist. His most famous work dates from this period, 1856 to 1858, especially his seascapes. The studio was a fancy place, but in spite of his artistic success, his business was a financial failure: the business was poorly managed and ran into debts.Metropolitan Museum of Art.

He therefore \\"closed his studio, abandoned his wife and children, and fled the country to escape his creditors.\\" He began to tour the Mediterranean in 1860 with the writer Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. They encountered Giuseppe Garibaldi during the trip and Le Gray photographed Garibaldi and Palermo. His striking pictures of Giuseppe Garibaldi and Palermo under Sicilian bombardment became as instantly famous throughout Europe. Dumas abandoned Le Gray and the other travelers in Malta and joined the revolutionary forces as a result of a personal conflict. Le Gray went to Lebanon, then Syria where he covered the movements of the French army for a magazine in 1861. Injured, he remained there before heading to Egypt. In Alexandria he photographed Henri d'Artois and the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom, and wrote to Nadar while sending him pictures. In 1862, his wife Leonardi returned to Rome, requesting and receiving 150 francs for financial assistance. In 1863, Leonardi asked Le Gray to provide her with a monthly pension of 50 or 60 francs. He established himself in Cairo in 1864; earning a modest living as a professor of drawing, while retaining a small photography shop. He sent pictures to the universal exhibition in 1867 but they did not really catch anyone's attention. He received commissions from the vice-king Ismail Pasha. From this late period there remain 50 pictures. On 16 January 1883, he had a son with the nineteen-year-old Ana√Øs Candounia. Registration of their sons birth was voided due to lack of proof of Leonardi's death. Le Gray died on 30 July 1884, in Cairo. His only surviving child from his marriage to Leonardi, Alfred, was designated as his heir. Technical innovations Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau (1851) His technical innovations included: * Improvements on paper negatives, specifically waxing them before exposure \\"making the paper more receptive to fine detail\\".Rosenblum, Naomi. A world history of photography, 4th edition. New York: Abbeville, 2007. * A collodion process published in 1850 but which was \\"theoretical at best\\".Peres, Michael R. The Focal encyclopedia of photography digital imaging, theory and applications, history, and science, 4th edition. Amsterdam and Boston: Elsevier/Focal Press, 2007. The invention of the wet collodion method to produce a negative on a glass plate is now credited to Frederick Scott Archer who published his process in 1851. * Combination printing, creating seascapes by using one negative for the water and one negative for the sky. Works Le Gray documented French monuments on a mission for the French government with other French photographers. He was a successful portrait photographer, capturing figures such as Napoleon III and Edward VII. He also became famous for his seascapes, or marine. He spent 20 years in Cairo, Egypt, but there are few works from this period. =World records for most expensive photograph sold at auction, 1999‚Äì2003= The Beech Tree (circa 1856) In October 1999, Sotheby's sold a Le Gray albumen print \\"Beech Tree, Fontainebleau\\" for ¬£419,500, which was a world record for the most expensive single photograph ever sold at auction, to an anonymous buyer.Melikian, Souren.
