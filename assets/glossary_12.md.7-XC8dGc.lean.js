Its intermediate host is the fiddler crab Uca pigilatorKinsella, 1988, p. 277 and it lives in the intestine of the marsh rice rat, its definitive host. Together with two other species of Maritrema, it is very common in affected marsh rice rats; it infects 19% of studied rats at Cedar Key. According to Tkach and colleagues, M. heardi is probably primarily a parasite of birds that has secondarily infected the marsh rice rat.Tkach et al., 2003, p. 11 Floridatrema was distinguished from Maritrema on the basis of its possession of loops of the uterus that extend forward to the place where the intestine is forked or even to the pharynx.

It is, with Niedersch√∂neweide (Lower Sch√∂neweide), part of the geographic area of Sch√∂neweide. Until 2001 it was part of the former borough of K√∂penick. History First mentioned in 1598 as Sch√∂ne Weyde, it became an industrial town at the end of the 19th century. In 1920 it merged into Berlin with the \\"Greater Berlin Act\\". The Berlin territorial reform with effect from 1 April 1938 also affected the districts Treptow and K√∂penick. The districts Obersch√∂neweide and Wuhlheide were removed from the district Treptow and incorporated into the district K√∂penick. In the Nazi era Obersch√∂neweide developed into a stronghold of resistance against National Socialism, which despite constant arrests and death sentences could not be broken. The resistance cells were the most numerous in the years 1942-1944. The factories in Oberschoeneweide remained the foundation of the illegal Berlin KPD headquarters. The mass recalls from 1941 resulted in a lack of staff in the factories. In order to maintain production, more and more forced laborers from all over Europe were employed. Several barracks camps were built for forced laborers in Wuhlheide. Here was also the same named, the Gestapo subordinate Berlin work education camp. More than 6,000 foreign forced laborers worked in Kabelwerk Oberspree and other factories located in the AEG factory complex, as well as female inmates of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1944/1945. In the air raids of the Allies on June 21 and August 6, 1944, Obersch√∂neweide was covered with a dense bomb carpet, while the Kabelwerk Wilhelminenhof heavily destroyed. The attack of February 26, 1945 met Obersch√∂neweide once again in its entirety. Among the casualties were many foreign forced laborers. On April 16, 1945, during the Battle of Berlin (one of the last battles of World War II in Europe), before the German troops left Obersch√∂neweide, they tried to stop Red Army at the bridges \\"Kaisersteg\\" and \\"Treskowbr√ºcke\\". On April 24 the zone was in the hands of the 8th Guards Army of the Soviet Union. The administrative division of Greater Berlin by the Allied victorious powers Obersch√∂neweide fell with the other districts of the district of K√∂penick under Soviet control. As everywhere else in the Soviet occupation zone, all non-destroyed means of production were dismantled and brought to the Soviet Union in Obersch√∂neweide. It followed the expropriation of the industrial enterprises; they were later converted into state-owned enterprises. The Queen Elisabeth Hospital served Soviet troops as a military hospital from October 1945 and remained there until the complete withdrawal of Soviet / Russian troops from Germany in 1994. In the 1950s, the radio house Nalepastra√üe was built. Here, all the radio programs of the GDR were produced centrally by the radio of the GDR. Historical infos about Obersch√∂neweide Due to the changing economy since the reunification on 3 October 1990, many companies have suffered layoffs, closures and privatisations. This was the end of the traditional industrial location. The South Korean industrial giant Samsung operated on the Samsung SDI in Obersch√∂neweide until the end of 2005, a production site for tube TVs and mobile devices. He gave up the location despite the receipt of subsidies in the millions of subsidies by the state of Berlin due to sales problems and inefficiency. The industrial buildings Obersch√∂neweides are listed since 1991 and are a focal point of the Berlin industrial heritage. Many small craft enterprises have settled on the industrial estates. The traditional medium- sized companies include Silicon Sensor GmbH (formed by the spin-off of the former television electronics factory) and BAE Batterien GmbH (at the location of Accumulatoren Fabrik Aktiengesellschaft, AFA). In 2006, the former AEG terrain was redeveloped into the HTW Berlin, Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin. As of 2017, there are 18,000 students. During rush hours, several roads were congested at many times which is at Spree-, Edison- and Siemensstra√üe. As a result, the surrounding residential areas are affected, which led to the inclusion of the entire area in the noise reduction planning in Berlin. To relieve the congestion, two more bridges are planned. The Minna Todenhagen Bridge is part of the southeastern connection, to be completed in the first phase. It leads east to the Britzer canal over the Spree and connects the Rummelsberg Road, over the Minna Todenhagen Road with the K√∂penicker country road and fast road on Niedersch√∂neweider area. On February 27, 2012, the plan approval decision was issued, construction began in 2013. The construction period should be three years. On 21 December 2017, the road was opened to traffic. The other bridge, Wilhelminenhofbr√ºcke, whose construction project is still in planning, is to lead to the eastern extension of Wilheminenhofstra√üe over the Spree to the Schnellerstra√üe in the Oberspree. Geography Located in the south-eastern side of the city and crossed by the river Spree, Obersch√∂neweide borders with the localities of Pl√§nterwald, Baumschulenweg, Niedersch√∂neweide, K√∂penick, Karlshorst and Rummelsburg (both in Lichtenberg district). Its urban park is the Wuhlheide, in which is located the ridable miniature railway Berliner Parkeisenbahn (BPE), used during the East German period by the Young Pioneer Organisation. Education The Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft (HTW - translated as University of Applied Sciences for Engineering and Economy), the youngest and largest University of Applied Sciences of Berlin, has the Campus Wilhelminenhof Infos about the Campus Wilhelminenhof on HTW website located in Obersch√∂neweide. In addition, the German Ministry of Education in this town has 3 urban day care centres, ten schools - two primary schools, one integrated secondary school (integrated programme) and seven other secondary schools (no other high school). Other institutions, which is similar to the SkillsFuture for their training institutions, and also parts of the institute of adult learning. Many of the students are attached to various companies in the area which is for the internship (industrial attachment programme): *Technologie- und Gr√ºnderzentrum Spreeknie (TGS) *E. Michaelis & Co.

Located by the southern shore of the Spree in Niedersch√∂neweide, it is the station of Sch√∂neweide. The locality is also served by the tramway lines M17, 21, 27, 37, 63 and 67. At Wilhelmstrand, by the river, it is a short ferry service (line F11) that links it to Baumschulenstra√üe, in Baumschulenweg. The northern part is located from Rummelsberg, Lichtenberg and on the other hand from the district Karlshorst on the street Am Walde, on the Rummelsburger highway along the Treskowallee and Rudolf-R√ºhl-Allee, which runs along the eastern edge of town and meets the street An der Wuhlheide. There were plans for the U5 to be extended from Friedrichsfelde via Karlshorst, to Obersch√∂neweide in the 1950s, however this was not realized with the extension to H√∂now in the late 1980s. Since 2017, the bus service 365 was introduced from Obersch√∂neweide to Baumschulenweg.

He was a Hard Edge painter and a close friend to Lawrence Alloway. Together with Georg Karl Pfahler Kirchberger was the founder of the gruppe 11. Life Kirchberger studied at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1950-1954 where he came in close contact with abstract painter Willi Baumeister. In 1956 he went to London and became friends with Lawrence Alloway, Denis Bowen and Ralph Rumney. Back in Stuttgart, he founded gruppe 11 (group 11) together with Georg Karl Pfahler. The group had exhibitions in Munich, Brussel, Rome and London in 1957-59. In 1959 his art shifted from Art informel to color forms. In 1960 he comes in contact with the philosopher Max Bense and his circle, and 1964 he finally becomes a pure Hard Edge painter. Since 1964 he taught at the Werkkunstschule (School of Applied Arts) in Krefeld and began working with so called do-it-yourself paintings. One of his students was the later star photographer Peter Lindbergh. Since 1996 Kirchberger lived in Bad Boll, near G√∂ppingen. He died in G√∂ppingen in 2010.

Early life  Sen Gupta was born in Faridpur, India, in 1889, to Turini Charan and Muktakeshi Sen Gupta. He attended Bengal National College, an educational institution that was founded as a means of challenging British hegemony in India by putting education exclusively under national control (i.e., achieving self-reliance through education). Sen Gupta appeared to have been interested in the practical application of science from a young age. His rigorous and systematic exercise routines not only contributed to his physical strength and definition but they were also renowned in his village.Sen Gupta, K. C. & Ghosh, B. C.

As a leading proponent of the scientific nature of psychological research, Sen Gupta was instrumental in the inclusion of psychology as a distinct division of the Indian Science Congress in 1923, and was elected president of the division in 1925. Sen Gupta also played an integral role in the founding of the Indian Psychological Association in 1924, and became the founding editor of the Indian Journal of Psychology in 1925. Despite Sen Gupta's focus on the promotion of experimental psychology, his literary contributions to psychological knowledge include a significant number of non-empirical papers regarding the social, ethnic, experimental, education, criminal, and religious aspects of psychology. This apparent disparity appears to have been common among early Indian psychologists who compartmentalized their work in experimental psychology, which was modeled after Western psychological tradition, from other scholarly and personally satisfying pursuits. At the University of Lucknow In 1928, Sen Gupta left Calcutta to assume an administrative position at the University of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. At the University of Lucknow, he collaborated with Radhakamal Mukerjee, an eminent sociologist, to write a text on social psychology. Although the text, Introduction to Social Psychology: Mind in Society, was one of the first books written on social psychology in India, it was reviewed as more sociological in tone than psychological.Hunt, W. A. (1929). Review of 'Introduction to Social Psychology' [Review of the book Introduction to Social Psychology]. Psychology Bulletin, 26(12), 712. In addition, reviews stated that the book was written from the stance of Western research literature that was current at the time, and included minimal material from Indian sources, thus representing the westernization of scholarship in India.Faris, E. (1929). Review [Review of the books Social Psychology Interpreted, Introduction to Social Psychology, An Outline of Social Psychology, Social Psychology: The Psychology of Political Domination]. The American Journal of Sociology, 35(2), 304-308. =Influence on curriculum= Sen Gupta was appointed Professor of Philosophy at the University of Lucknow in 1929. He introduced psychology into the philosophy curricula, and soon established the Department of Experimental Psychology, which focused primarily on social and experimental psychology. By the mid-1930s, he began mentoring students in experimental psychology, including Indian psychologists Raj Narain and H. S. Asthana. While at Lucknow, Sen Gupta published Heredity in Mental Traits (1942) and Mental Growth and Decay (1940).Vidyarthi, L. P. (1978). Rise of Anthropology in India. New Delhi, India: Concept Publishing Company. However, his interests shifted to the psychology of religion during the latter portion of his life, and he focused on experimentally investigating \\"Sadhana,\\" the spiritual pursuit required for the accomplishment of goals. As a student of Sanskrit and Pali languages, Sen Gupta drew from original literature from religious texts of ancient India and the classics of Christian mysticism to write his \\"magnum opus,\\" which he planned to publish under the title of Mechanisms of Ecstasy. The manuscript was lost in the confusion following Sen Gupta's death in June 1944 due to a stroke.  Publications  Sen Gupta made contributions to the disciplines of psychology, philosophy, education, and anthropology in India. He was the founding editor of the Indian Journal of Psychology, and his writings include: *Introduction to Social Psychology (1928), co-authored with Radhakamal Mukerjee *Mental Growth and Decay (1940) *Heredity in Mental Traits (1942)  References  Category:1889 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Indian psychologists Category:University of Calcutta faculty Category:University of Lucknow faculty Category:Harvard College alumni Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Narendra Nath Sen Gupta"},{"id":"27092307","text":"Marilyn may refer to: * Marilyn (given name) * Marilyn (singer) (born 1962), British pop singer * Marilyn (hill), a type of mountain or hill in the British Isles with a prominence above 150 m * 1486 Marilyn, a Main-belt asteroid * Marilyn, a 1980 opera by Lorenzo Ferrero * Marilyn (1953 film), directed by Wolf Rilla * Marilyn (1963 film), a documentary film about Marilyn Monroe's biography * Marilyn (2011 film), a 2011 romance film * Marilyn (2018 film), a 2018 Argentine film * Marilyn (Mario character), a character in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door * Marilyn: An American Fable, a musical by Patricia Michaels, Jeanne Napoli, et al. * Marilyn (biography), a biography of Marilyn Monroe by Norman Mailer * \\"Marilyn\\", a 2000 horror short story by Jack Dann * My Week with Marilyn, a 2011 film about Marilyn Monroe  See also  * Shot Marilyns, a painting by Andy Warhol * Marilyn Diptych, a painting by Andy Warhol * Marilyn Monroe, an American actress and sex symbol * Marilyn Manson, an American singer ** Marilyn Manson (band), an American rock band * \\"Mary Lynne\\" (song), a 1980 song by the band Sector 27 on the album Sector 27 * ","title":"Marilyn"},{"id":"27092312","text":"The 1997 Italian Figure Skating Championships () was held from December 12 through 15, 1996.

Outside of Ireland, it can be of English and German origin. Etymology In some cases the English and German name is derived from the Middle High German Polan, which means \\"Poland\\". The surname originally signified a person with Polish connections. In some cases, particularly in New England, the English Poland is an Americanized form of the French Poulin. This French surname originated from an occupational name of a poultry breeder, or from a fearful person; it is derived from the Old French poule, which means \\"chicken\\"., which cited: , for the surname \\"Poulin\\". In other cases, particularly in Ireland, the English Poland is a variant of Polin,, which cited: , for the surname \\"Poland\\". which is in turn an Anglicised form of the original Gaelic spelling of Mac P√≥il√≠n, which translated from Irish means \\"son of little Paul\\". This Irish surname originated as a patronymic, derived from a pet form of the Irish P√≥l (the English form of which is Paul)., which cited: , for the surname \\"Polin\\". There are multiple formulations of the anglicised spelling quite often with the 'Mac' or 'Mc' removed, including: (Mc)Poland, (Mc)Polin, (Mc)Polland, (Mc)Pullen, (Mc)Pullin, (Mc)Polan which in Ireland come from the same original Gaelic. The variety in spelling of this Irish surname and the examples where the 'Mac' or 'Mc' has been dropped can be explained for several reasons. In English controlled areas of Ireland (especially around The Pale), it was declared that the Irish take on names in an English form and many were required to do so in order to do business with the powers that be, or to obtain a tenancy on English controlled land.Mac, Mc, and O Names in Ireland, Scotland, & America. IrishRoots.com Census takers were also allowed to use either form, with or without the Gaelic prefix. It also was not uncommon for the 'Mac' or 'Mc' prefix to simply be incorporated into the surname to result in one word e.g. Magawley, Maginnis. A further reason for the variety in anglicised forms of the surname can be explained, as Irish Catholic priests, whilst literate, were only required to record surname spellings phonetically on birth certificates. This led to individuals sometimes having their surname recorded with a different spelling from their father, and indeed there are many examples of individuals with their surname spelt differently from their birth and death certificates even in the 20th century. Whilst literacy rates amongst the general Irish population were low in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, such variant spellings were rarely questioned. Distribution At present Poland (and its many variants) is considered a rare Gaelic surname throughout Ireland, as it is found almost exclusively in counties Armagh and Down; it is, however, also found with some concentration in County Offaly.More Laois & Offaly Surnames. Irish Midlands Ancestry Occasionally the surname Poland, Pollane, Powland and Powlesland when found in English people with no Irish ancestry, the origin can be attributed to the village near the town of Odiham, in the county of Hampshire. The village called Poland has nothing whatsoever to do with the country of Poland. It is Olde English pre 7th century in origin, the derivation being from 'pol landa', meaning an area of agricultural land surrounded by lakes or pools, or possibly a place where 'poles' that is to say fencing poles were 'pollarded'. Most locational surnames were given to people after they left their original village and moved elsewhere. It was a simple form of identification. In England, surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation.Poland at the surname database 'Paulin' also appears as a personal name in the Domesday Book.

In addition to Diana Hubbard, the album includes musical contributions from Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, John Goodsall, Michael Boddicker, and Patrick Moraz. Artist Diana Hubbard was born in London, the daughter of L. Ron Hubbard, the author of Dianetics and other Scientology books. She was born Diana Meredith DeWolf Hubbard on September 24, 1952, to L. Ron Hubbard and his wife Mary Sue Hubbard. She was the first child born to Mary Sue and L. Ron Hubbard. She composed sonatas for piano at age 6. She attended the Royal Academy, where she took courses in ballet and music. In her early years as a teenager, she took executive courses in Scientology at Saint Hill Manor along with her brother, Quentin Hubbard. Her other siblings include Suzette and Arthur. At the age of 15, she left the Royal Academy, in order to serve within the Scientology organization and assist her father. During the bulk of her teenage years, she lived most of her life on her father's yacht, located in the Mediterranean. By age 16, she rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander within the elite Scientology group called the Sea Org. She became a spokesperson for the branch of the Church of Scientology within the United States in 1969. In 1979, Hubbard lived with her husband audiophile Jonathan Horwich and her daughter Roanne, in Clearwater, Florida. In 1980, she served as an executive within the Church of Scientology, and as of 2001 she maintained a leadership position within the organization. Inspiration According to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Hubbard was discovered when she performed one of her original pieces backstage, at an event sponsored by the organization, while working as a representative in the United States for the Church of Scientology. She was convinced to record a few tapes of her music in 1976. LifeTimes was recorded in 1979. In an interview about the album with The Harvard Crimson, Diana Hubbard explained her motivation and inspiration for the album. She said she wanted to compose music that \\"is felt but not heard\\", and attempted to revitalize the romantic aspects to jazz. She said that her work was \\"not trying to be any structured thing. In all of us we have the dreamer\\". Hubbard characterized her composition style as \\"impressionistic paintings in music\\", in an interview with the St. Petersburg Times. She commented, \\"My music is for the time when people want to turn out the lights, listen and escape into another world ... to dream places ... to little magical places in which the listener can participate and become involved.\\" Regarding a potential audience, Hubbard said, \\"My music is for intelligent listeners, who don't mind if I change chords, and are willing to see what happens next.\\" Explaining why written text did not accompany the songs, Hubbard said, \\"I wrote lots of poetry. But somehow it didn't feel right to have lyrics with the pieces ‚Äì I'd rather leave that slot open for the listener.\\" She wrote liner notes for each piece in the album, describing exactly what type of vision she was attempting to evoke with her compositions. For her description of the first track on the album, \\"Rose Coloured Lights\\", Hubbard wrote that the picture she was trying to bring about for the listener was \\"a yacht in the Mediterranean. Leaning over a rail at night thinking. The whole spectrum of love: the champagne of c'est la vie in a million stories...\\" Production The album was produced by an independent label, Waterhouse Records 8. Waterhouse Records was based in Minnesota, and at the time of the album's release it was available by mail order from Minneapolis. It includes performances from musicians Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke ‚Äì both Scientologists. Other noteworthy contributors include Patrick Moraz and Denny Seiwell. Musical artist Jimmie Spheeris persuaded Hubbard to record the album, and also served as its executive producer. The string portions were written by David Campbell. Hubbard wrote all of the music for the album, with contributors utilizing instruments including synthesizers, bass, woodwinds, strings, and a bouzouki. She plays piano on the album. Most of the pieces on the album are of three to four minutes in duration. Wayne Isaak served as the Waterhouse Records publicist for the album. In publicity for the album, marketing compared Hubbard's musical writing style to that of Erik Satie. The album cover was marketed with a sticker on the outside wrapping advertising the fact that it was endorsed by Stanley Clarke. Reception Billboard highlighted the album in its column, \\"Billboard's Top Album Picks\\", in the section \\"First Time Around\\". Billboard described the album as \\"a light classics pop LP\\" and noted, \\"The music is mostly soft and pretty drawing from many ethnic sources.\\" The Sarasota Herald-Tribune described the album as \\"an instrumental with a medieval quality in the all-encompassing and sometimes mysterious sound of strings, piano and rhythm section. The repetitive phrasing and rolling melody are synthesized tone and nuance.\\" The St. Petersburg Times described Hubbard's piano compositions as \\"fresh, haunting melodies\\". In a review of the album for The Harvard Crimson, Thomas M. Levenson wrote, \\"Hubbard's music does not, as a result, offend the listener. It's not execrable. It is just extraordinarily dull. As a pianist/composer, Hubbard sounds like Bruckner rewritten for the dentist's office.\\" Don Lewis reviewed the album for The Milwaukee Journal, and commented, \\"It's peaceful, attractive music, even though, after a while, it sounds like many of Miss Hubbard's compositions are swatches from the same bolt of cloth.\\" \\"Rose Coloured Lights\\" was issued as a single on Waterhouse 15003 and hit #40 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in 1980.

Career He was invested as a knight before 1460 while serving as a Commissioner of the Peace for York. As a Yorkist sympathiser, he fought for the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Northampton and was injured at the Battle of Towton. He was also at the Battle of Hexham. He was invested as a Knight of the Garter by Edward IV in 1463. In 1475 he joined the king with 20 men-at-arms and 200 archers to invade France. In 1482 he led the van of the English army under the Earl of Northumberland when invading Scotland.http://www.celtic-casimir.com/webtree/18/34246.htm He served the crown on a variety of important missions and commissions.http://www.celtic-casimir.com/webtree/18/34246.htm In 1485 he supported the Yorkist Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth but was pardoned by the victor Henry VII, possibly at the intercession of the King's mother, who was the half-sister of his second wife Elizabeth. After the accession of Henry VII he then supported the Yorkist pretender Lambert Simnel and in 1487, with Thomas, 6th Baron Scrope of Masham, made an unsuccessful attack on Bootham Bar in York, This time he had to pay a heavy fine and remain within the London area.http://everything2.com/title/Baron+Scrope+of+Boltonhttp://www.palmspringsbum.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I4493&tree;=Legends In 1497 he fought against the Scots and assisted in raising the siege of Norham Castle.

Marriages and issue John Scrope married, firstly in 1447, Joan FitzHugh, daughter of William FitzHugh, 4th Baron FitzHugh and Margery Willoughby. Their son and heir was Henry Scrope. He married secondly, before 10 December 1471, Elizabeth St John (d. before 3 July 1494), daughter of Sir Oliver St John (d.1437) and Margaret Beauchamp of Bletso, maternal grandmother of King Henry VII of England. She was the widow of William Zouche, 5th Baron Zouche (d. 25 December 1462) of Harringworth. In 1470, Elizabeth was godmother to the future King Edward V of England. Her loyalty to the House of York was inevitably suspect since she was the half- sister of Lady Margaret Beaufort, who was the mother of the future King Henry VII. John and Elizabeth were proclaimed loyalists to the House of Lancaster, yet John seemed to stick by the Yorkist side.

His 20-year reign was the beginning of the decline of Ava's hold on Upper Burma. Yamethin, a region to the east of Ava, revolted upon Minkhaung's accession to the Ava throne and stayed independent throughout Minkhaung's reign. The southern regions of Prome and Tharrawaddy revolted in 1482, and also stayed independent. By the mid-1490s, the Shan states of Mohnyin, Mogaung, Momeik and Kale (Kalay) had also broken away, and begun raiding northern Ava territories.Phayre 1967: 86‚Äì87 Minkhaung increasingly came to rely on Mingyi Nyo, the Viceroy of Toungoo, for military assistance. By the end of his reign, Toungoo was equally powerful as its nominal overlord Ava.Fernquest 2005 Minkhaung II made his eldest son Thihathura II joint-king and co-ruled the kingdom for 15 years. But Thihathura II died a month before his father. Minkhaung II died in April 1501 and was succeeded by his younger son Shwenankyawshin (Narapati II). Years as Crown Prince Minkhaung II was the eldest son of King Thihathura of Ava who made him crown prince during his reign (1468‚Äì1480), and was given Dabayin region in fief. His younger brothers also ruled various regions. His uncles Mingyi Swa and Thado Minsaw ruled the southern regions of Prome (Pyay) and Tharrawaddy, respectively. Reign King Thihathura died in 1480, and Minkhaung II ascended the throne with the regnal name of Thirithuddhamma Yaza. As had become customary with the accession of each Ava king, Minkhaung needed to secure the loyalty of the rulers of each region in the kingdom. The new king's uncles in Prome and Tharrawaddy scarcely acknowledged him. But closer to Ava, his younger brothers, the rulers of Salin and Se in the west, and the ruler of Yamethin in the southeast openly revolted. =Rebellions= Minye Kyawswa of Yamethin, which held the five irrigation districts of all important Kyaukse granary, was the greatest threat to Ava's power. Minkhaung ordered Sithu Kyawhtin, the former general and viceroy of Toungoo (Taungoo), to attack Yamethin, which is midway between Ava and Toungoo, from the south, while he marched from the north. But Yamethin's heavily fortified defenses prevailed. Sithu Kyawhtin died in battle, and Minkhaung called off the attack after a two-month-long siege. He appointed Sithu Kyawhtin's son Min Sithu (or Sithunge) as the new governor of Toungoo. Ava continuously tried to subdue Yamethin in subsequent years but the rebellious province managed to stay independent for the rest of his reign. His inability to regain control of the Kyaukse granary meant Ava was never strong enough to pacify other regions. In 1482, Mingyi Swa of Prome died, and his brother Thado Minsaw of Tharrawaddy took over Prome, and declared himself independent. His nephew the king sent a force to attack Prome. But the Avan army could not take Prome, and retreated. Prome became an independent kingdom with territories up to Tharrawaddy and Myede. (It would stay independent until 1533, and semi-independent under Ava's rule until 1542.) Still in 1482, the Shan states of Mohnyin and Momeik in the north also revolted. Minkhaung, still focused on Yamethin, could not do much with the other revolts. By the 1490s, the Shan states previously loyal to Ava--Kale (Kalay), Mogaung along with Mohnyin and Momeik had also escaped Ava's control. Only the Shan state of Hsipaw (Thibaw) remained a steadfast ally of Ava. Mohyin in particular resumed its historic role in raiding Upper Burma towns, especially Myedu. =Alliance with Mingyi Nyo of Toungoo= In 1485, Mingyi Nyo assassinated his uncle Min Sithu, whom Minkhaung appointed as governor of Toungoo only five years earlier. But Nyo quickly sent tributes to Ava. Minkhaung was not in a position to punish Nyo and accepted Nyo's submission. He formally granted Nyo Toungoo. Nyo remained a loyal ally of Ava for the remainder of Minkhaung's reign. In the 1490s, Toungoo fought against Yamethin and Hanthawaddy Kingdom in the south. In 1492, after the death of King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy, Nyo without Minkhaung's permission, sent a probing raid into Hanthawaddy territory. New Hanthawaddy king Binnya Ran II sent a retaliatory raid in 1495. By the end of his reign, Toungoo was equally powerful as its nominal overlord Ava. Ava and Yamethin were locked in a series of wars until the end. Minye Kyawswa of Yamethin died in August/September 1500 (Tawthalin 862 ME). His brother Minkhaung died shortly after on 7 April 1501 (5th waning of Tagu 862 ME). =Joint rule with his son= At his accession to the throne, Minkhaung made his seven-year-old eldest son the heir-apparent.

Its name meant \\"Port Tukulti-Ninurta\\". History Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta was a totally new foundation about three kilometers North of Assur, which was the old capital of the Assyrian empire. Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta was placed on the eastern bank of the river Tigris. The walled area of the town was about 800 by 800 meters in size. In the middle there was a wall dividing the city into a western and eastern part. In the western part, near to the river, a temple was excavated for the Assyrian main deity, Ashur. The temple complex, measuring about 53 by 90 meters had a zikkurat on its western side. In the zikkurat was found a text identifying the temple as the temple of Ashur and also providing an identification of the city (the city was already before the excavations known from other texts). From further texts it is known that the cult image of the god was moved from Assur to this temple. North of the temple stood the royal palace. The palace was placed on a platform, originally about 18m high. All remains of the palace building on the platform are lost, although many wall paintings were found. They show that the palace was richly decorated. Next to the palace a second, badly preserved palace building was found. Perhaps this was the entrance for a bigger palace complex, incorporating both palaces. The city was largely abandoned after the death of king Tukulti-Ninurta I with minor occupation continuing through the Neo-Assyrian period. The cult image of Ashur was brought back to Assur. stone figure of a monkey from Kar-Tukulti- Ninurta Archaeology Plan of the Ashur temple Stele of Adad-bel ukin, governor of Libbi-ali, Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta, Ekallatum, Itu, and Ruqahu.

Life Son of Marc Antoine Jullien, deputy from Dr√¥me in the National Convention, he entered the Coll√®ge de Navarre in 1785; his studies were interrupted by the beginning of the Revolution. Encouraged by his ardently patriotic mother, Rosalie Ducrolay, named \\"Madame Jullien\\", he attempted a career in journalism, in 1790 becoming a collaborator on the Journal du Soir. The following year, he became a member of the Jacobin Club, in which he became an opponent of war. In the spring of 1792, Jullien was sent to London by the Marquis de Condorcet, at the time president of the comit√© diplomatique of the Legislative Assembly. There he served as a student-diplomat, becoming an intermediary between the more liberal English factions and the Girondists. Among those he met there were Talleyrand and Lord Stanhope. Returning to France that autumn, he was named aide-commissairem and then commissaire des guerres, of the army of the Pyrenees, in January 1793. He was soon transferred to Tarbes \\"due to age\\". He rejoined the army of the Pyrenees on April 16, entering Paris with them on August 4. Jullien then became a prot√©g√© of Robespierre, and was sent by the Committee of Public Safety on a mission to several Atlantic ports, beginning on September 10, 1793. Charged with ensuring surveillance of the military situation and of Jacobin propaganda, he attempted to gain for himself a rapport with public feeling. In Nantes, on February 4, 1794, he wrote a letter to Robespierre in which he denounced Carrier. At Bordeaux, he stood in opposition to Jean-Lambert Tallien and his mistress, Th√©r√©sa Cabarr√∫s. He left Bordeaux to return to Paris on April 24, 1794; there he was named to the Executive Committee on Public Instruction. On May 18, he returned to Bordeaux, to purify the municipality and the Jacobin Club and seek out hidden Girondists among the deputies. Jullien would likely have become a major player in the Revolution had it not been for the execution, by guillotine, of Robespierre in July 1794. Made destitute, he was arrested on August 10 and sent to prison; he would be held at the maison de sant√© of Notre-Dame-des-Champs, and would testify at Carrier's trial. He disavowed his association with Robespierre and was released, through the intervention of his father, on October 14, 1795. Ten days later, the insurrection of 13 Vend√©miaire was stopped. Jullien next became one of the founders of the Club du Panth√©on, returning to journalism with the creation of L'Orateur pl√©b√©ien, a democratic and moderate pamphlet, with √àve Demaillot and Jean-Jacques Leuliette. On March 13, 1796, Merlin de Douai helped him enter the Minist√®re de la Police, where he became responsible for lists of emigrans. He soon became suspected of Babouvist sympathies, and was forced to hide after the discovery of the Conspiracy of Equals in May 1796; he reappeared in October of the same year. Jullien next joined the Army of Italy, becoming a writer for its mail service from August to November 1797. He then accompanied Napoleon I, in May 1798, on his journey to Egypt. There he became ill, and returned to France with Louis Bonaparte. Becoming well, he entered the service of general Championnet, becoming an adviser on December 28, 1798. Among the initiators of the Neapolitan Republic, he became secretary general to Championnet's provisional government on January 26, 1799. He was quickly recalled by the Directory, and was arrested on February 24. On March 12 he stood before a military tribunal, but was freed by the Coup of 30 Prairial Year VII on June 18. Accommodating the coup of 18 Brumaire to satisfaction, Jullien proposed a plan to unify the Italian states in July 1800. Immediately becoming indignant at anti-Jacobin proscriptions, following the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise he was relegated to handling administrative functions in Paris. He received the cross of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1803. After a visit to Madame de Sta√´l at Chaumont-sur-Loire, through which he raised Napoleon's suspicions, he was sent to the Kingdom of Italy in 1810; while passing through Yverdon, he became acquainted with the Swiss pedagogue Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. In 1813. Jullien was jailed due to his opposition to the Empire. Freed during the Bourbon Restoration, he published numerous opposition journals between 1815 and 1817, becoming known in the process as a pedagogue. He corresponded regularly with Pestalozzi, to whom he sent his first three sons, at Yverdon, and became a promoter of the Monitorial System of education. In 1819 he founded Revue encyclop√©dique.:fr:Revue encyclop√©dique Jullien died in Paris in 1848. Marriage and family In 1801 Jullien married Sophie-Juvence Nioche (died 1832); she bore him six children. The eldest of the six, Pierre-Adolphe (born Amiens, February 13, 1803 - died 1873) was a technician, later becoming engineer-in-chief of the Corps of Bridges and Roads; in this capacity he oversaw construction of the Paris-Lyon railroad. Also among the six, their daughter Antoinette-St√©phanie married the dramatist Lockroy and was the mother of √âdouard Lockroy.

The Aamber Pegasus is a home computer first produced in New Zealand in 1981 by Technosys Research Labs. The hardware was designed by Stewart J Holmes. The software was designed by Paul Gillingwater, Nigel Keam and Paul Carter. It is thought that Apple Computers introduction of the Apple II computer into the New Zealand market, and its subsequent heavy educational discounting was the final nail in the coffin for Technosys and the Aamber Pegasus computer. Total production numbers are unknown, but it is thought \\"around one hundred\\" were sold. Technical specifications * CPU: MC6809C * Memory: 4k RAM, later versions 64k RAM * Input: QWERTY style key-matrix Keyboard * Output: TV via RF modulator Software An optional multi ROM board in conjunction with a rotating dial allowed switching between 6 EPROM banks containing multiple language environments, games and applications. The EPROM based language environments include EXTENDED BASIC, PASCAL, BASIC (a variant of TinyBASIC), MAD (Assembler/Disassembler) and FORTH. Games available on EPROM are TANKS, INVADERS and GALAXY WARS. Other software included MONITOR (the system BIOS which needed to be present for the system to run) and a word processor application called WORD. The system allowed loading of programs by cassette. Some available cassettes include SNAKES, STAR TREK, HANGMAN and CHARACTER GENERATOR. Networking A network version of the Aamber Pegasus provided connectivity to a 6809-based server (SWTPC-6809). Especially the networking version attempted to address the New Zealand Government's computers in schools initiative, but never produced the hoped-for large orders. Unusual design features One of the most unusual aspects of the machine is that to save the cost of a CRTC, the processor set up some bits on the 6821(PIA) to control the row being read out, then stepped through a series of NOPs so that the address lines of the CPU could act as a big counter. This counter drove the X address of the display RAM. On every row, the CPU updates the row number selected from the character ROM (and programmable character RAM) and every 16th row it increments the Y address of the display RAM. At the end of the screen the output is blanked, and the CPU gets to do some ‚Äúreal‚Äù work until the FIRQ pin is pulsed by the 50 Hz line from the power supply. Essentially the Pegasus used the mains frequency to trigger vertical sync. Because of this, the CPU is ~90% occupied as a counter, so in a non-real-time application you could disable the FIRQ (one bit in the 6809's CC reg) and the Pegasus ran ~10x faster ‚Äì albeit with a blank screen.

It was the 100th anniversary of the May Revolution, when viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros was ousted from office and replaced with the Primera Junta, the first national government.  Context  Commemorative copper medal by Ernesto de la C√°rcova, exhibited at the Bicentennial Museum The year of 1910 was considered quite positive for Argentina, when the last century was seen in retrospective. Argentina had a well-established state, with no inner conflicts and national limits delimited. Besides, the main institutions ‚ÄìArmy, public schools, post service, among others‚Äì were efficient. Through them the Government could advance to a vigorous nation, driven by the immigration, the growth of the agriculture and cattle and the external trade. People trusted the state even to mediate conflicts.\\"El espejo lejano del primer Centenario\\" , on Revista √ë, Clar√≠n, 25 Apr 2010 Argentina was known as \\"el granero del mundo\\" (\\"world's barn\\") due to its prosperous agriculture.

Of 6 million inhabitants, 1 million were Italian and 800,000 were Spanish. A growing interest in improving democracy led to the sanction of the S√°enz Pe√±a Law, two years later. The first Argentine copyright law was also enacted by this time, superseding a patent law that was being used so far for such topics. The centennial had also an important impact on the historiography of Argentina. Because of the growing numbers of immigrants coming from very different places, it was felt that it was need to clearly define an \\"Argentine identity\\". Topics that had once canonic views, such as the wars of independence, started to be seen from multiple perspectives.Doscientos a√±os pensando la Revoluci√≥n de Mayo by Jorge Gelman & Ra√∫l Fradkin ‚Äì Editorial Sudamericana, Buenos Aires, 2010 ‚Äì  Celebrations  Infanta Isabella and President of Argentina Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta during the celebrations The Argentina national rugby union team before playing its first international v. the British Lions at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina, 12 June 1910 On February 8, 1909, the National Congress promulgated Law 6,286 that regulated the commemoration of the May Revolution.

Spreading centers in the Gulf, like this one in Farallon, are different from more well known spreading axes like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise, since they form as deep rift valleys rather than bathymetric highs. One familiar source of terrigenous input to the Gulf is the Colorado River, which empties into the northern Gulf (though no longer consistently, as a result of overuse for irrigation). Further south, especially in the eastern Gulf, the Sierra Madre Occidental are a more important source of sediment.

His career was set back by numerous injuries which impacted and ultimately curtailed his time in the league. Konz was selected with the 245th overall pick in the 7th round of the 2010 NFL Draft by the Seahawks, originally as a wide receiver. He played college football at Kent State, playing multiple positions on both defense and offense throughout his college career. Despite not being invited to the NFL combine, Konz attracted the attention of NFL teams after his pro day workout at Kent State when he posted some of the best measurables of any player in that year's draft. Konz ran the 40 yard dash in 4.38 seconds on his second attempt, made a 10'-8\\" broad jump, and performed a 46\\" vertical jump. He later completed 27 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press during a pre-draft workout for the New Orleans Saints. Professional career =Seattle Seahawks= After spending the 2010 NFL season on injured reserve due to a hip injury suffered in training camp, Konz began the 2011 training camp playing tight end. After numerous injuries to several Seahawks' defensive linemen early on in training camp, the Seattle Seahawks under head coach Pete Carroll switched Konz to play on defense as a blitzing LEO defensive end and linebacker in practice, as Seahawks' coaches were impressed by his ability to put pressure on the quarterback. In the first pre-season game of 2011 versus the San Diego Chargers, Konz saw action at defensive end and recorded a sack in the 4th quarter on quarterback Scott Tolzien as the Chargers were attempting a late comeback. Konz was released on the final roster cut down on September 3, 2011, but then re-signed to the Seahawks practice squad the following day as he was highly valued by the team for his versatility and ability to play multiple positions. Konz was signed to a new contract when he was added to the Seahawks active roster on October 4, 2011. He was on the active 46 player game day roster starting on special teams, and recorded a tackle during the Seahawks 36-25 win over the New York Giants on October 9, 2011 at Giants' Met Life Stadium. In that same game following a late 4th quarter interception return for a touchdown by Brandon Browner from a pass by Eli Manning, Konz tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) while covering the subsequent kickoff. Konz was subsequently placed on the season ending injured reserve list the following week, and underwent successful surgery on his knee on October 25, 2011 in Seattle. He remained out of the league during the 2012 season as he worked on rehabilitating his knee. In April 2013 just prior to the NFL draft, Konz participated in 3 day voluntary minicamp as a non-roster invitee with the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars under new head coach Gus Bradley, who was previously the defensive coordinator in Seattle. On July 30, 2013, Konz was signed to the 90 man roster by the Seattle Seahawks, and was switched back to offense at tight end during training camp and preseason games. After spending time working out in Southern California during the offseason, Konz showed up to camp having added 20 pounds of bulk from his original 234 pounds when he was drafted in 2010. On August 26, 2013, Konz was released by the Seahawks, but then re-signed to the practice squad on September 5, 2013. Konz was released from the Seahawks practice squad on October 1, 2013. =Dallas Cowboys= On December 4, 2013, Konz signed with the Dallas Cowboys practice squad and stayed with the team to finish the 2013 season.Cowboys fill out practice squad On December 30, the Cowboys chose to not sign Konz to a futures contract, making him a free agent. =Denver Broncos= Konz, along with seven other players, were signed to future contracts with the Denver Broncos on January 22, 2014. He reached 4th on the depth chart at tight end early on during the preseason before suffering a neck injury, and was subsequently released by the Broncos.

It has operations in Peru and Australia. In Zambia it owned the Lumwana Mining Company, but that was bought by Barrick Gold in 2011. Through Liontown Resources Limited and Alturas Minerals Corp., the company has gold and copper-gold exploration interests in Peru and Australia. The Lumwana project which had enough reserves to be productive for 37 years, cost the company one billion dollars to develop. In Zambia it has been credited with supporting social development through projects which aim to build schools, attract professionals to areas around its mine sites. 2010 copper production was 323.4 million pounds (146,690 tonnes) 68% higher than in 2009 (192.1 million pounds). The company produced slightly more copper than it sells (In 2010 323.4 vs 290.2 million pounds up from 2009 when it was 290.42 vs 179.72 million pounds), 77% of production occurred during the first nine months of the year (production was 113 kt, sales were 98kt); capital expenditure amounted to $66 million. In September 2010 company debt was $433 million, long term debt fell significantly in the last quarter of 2010 from $422 million down to $295.57 million. Even though Equinox doesn't produce gold Barrick Gold, the world's largest gold company (both in terms of reserves and production) acquired Equinox Minerals in April 2011; the deal will lower the fraction of revenue Barrick receives from the sale of gold to 80%. History The company formed after a merger between Equinox and Equinox Resources in January, 2004, and was incorporated the same month as a Canadian company. It began operations in Zambia in 1996. Prior to being acquired by Equinox in 1999 at least 10 different companies failed in their attempts to develop the Lumwana project, which covers 2 major copper mines and 1355 km squared in area. In 2010 Equinox was involved in a couple major transactions; first it acquired the Jabal Sayid copper-gold-silver project 350 km from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, capable of producing 2.6 million tons of ore per year starting in 2012. In February it launched a $4.8 billion hostile takeover bid for copper producer Lundin Mining, at the same time Lundin was attempting its own takeover ($9 billion Inmet Mining merger which would result in the creation of Symterra Corp). (As of April 2011 none of those deals have been finalized, combination with Lundin Mining would raise Equinox production growth rate 23%). In April 2011, Equinox rejected a takeover offer by China Minmetals, but later accepted a bid by Barrick Gold. On April 25, 2011, Barrick Gold Corporation announced the acquisition of Equinox for $7.69 billion.

Accessed 24 April 2010. After a year in the United States, Power worked as a freelance journalist in several European countries. In 1917, she became governess to the daughter of a business family in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, where she became caught up in the October Revolution. An illness she caught there may have triggered the progressive deafness from which she began to suffer. Power started to write history books for children in the 1920s, with her sister Eileen and later independently. In 1927 she began a career as a broadcaster with the BBC. She moved with the school broadcasting department to Bristol in 1939 and worked there for the rest of her life, apart from a year spent travelling in the Americas in 1946‚Äì1947. In 1950 she was awarded an MBE for her work. Redcap Runs Away Power's book of stories Redcap Runs Away, illustrated by C. Walter Hodges, has become a children's classic, although one in danger of being forgotten today.For Penelope Wilcock, a fellow historical novelist for children, it is one of her two favourite books in the genre: \\"Redcap Runs Away by Rhoda Power, first published in 1952: and Peter Abelard by Helen Waddell, first published in 1933 and still-‚Äìstill!-‚Äìavailable both used and new...\\" Retrieved 25 February 2016. It tells the story of a 10-year- old boy who takes up with a band of minstrels in the 14th century. As an anonymous reviewer in the Melbourne newspaper The Age put it in 1957, Redcap's adventures make \\"a peg on which to hang the stories the people used to hear in the market places and inns 600 years ago.... Miss Power has collected them from authentic sources and they still make very good reading.\\"The Age, Melbourne, 7 June 1957, p. 12. Junior Age: Let's Read Some Fancy-Dress Books! The book joined the prominent UK Puffin Story Books list in that year, as a selection of Eleanor Graham, the senior series editor. Writing in the Puffin fan magazine Junior Bookshelf for 1952‚Äì1953, Graham wrote, \\"I have only praise and the highest praise\\" for the book, which \\"stands head and shoulders above its contemporaries.\\" It was \\"a story which, if I am not mistaken, will set a new standard for us in children's stories.\\" The delineation of the characters and plot drew upon Rhoda's experience in schools' broadcasting, in which her forte was the dramatization of history for younger listeners. Her grasp of the social history of medieval England owes much to her older sister, the historian Eileen Power, who before her early death in 1940 had collaborated with Rhoda in preparing scripts for broadcasting on the BBC. Among these had been a story about life in a medieval village, told from the standpoint of Simon, a serf who had fled from a nearby manor. This story may have suggested the framework for Redcap Runs Away. However, English literary concern with minstrelsy has been continual since the Romantic period: poems such as Sir Walter Scott's The Lay of the Last Minstrel (1805) and John Clare's The Village Minstrel (1821), and novels like Helen Craik's Henry of Northumberland (1800), Sydney Owenson's The Novice of St. Dominick (a girl flees disguised as a minstrel, 1805), and more recently, Christabel Rose Coleridge's Minstrel Dick (a boy minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891) and Howard Spring's Darkie and Co. (a boy runs away from an unhappy home to join a travelling show, 1932). The inclusion of so many minstrel stories in Redcap adds to the book's authenticity, but not all US critics at the time viewed this favourably. Commenting on the 1954 US edition, The Bulletin of the Children's Book Center wrote that \\"because of the many stories which have been included (one to each chapter) the plot moves slowly, and reading is further hampered by the extremely poor format, with its small type, crowded lines, and poor paper.\\"Vol. VII/10, June 1954, p. 89.

The slave revolt started on November 15, 1842, when a group of 20 African- American slaves owned by the Cherokee escaped and tried to reach Mexico, where slavery had been abolished in 1829. Along their way south, they were joined by 15 slaves escaping from the Creek Nation in Indian Territory. (Date inconsistent with later assertion) The fugitives met with two slave catchers taking a family of eight slave captives back to the Choctaw Nation. The fugitives killed the hunters and allowed the family to join their party. Although an Indian party had captured and killed some of the slaves near the beginning of their flight, the Cherokee sought reinforcements. They raised an armed group of more than 100 of their and Choctaw warriors to pursue and capture the fugitives. Five slaves were later executed for killing the two slave catchers. What has been described as \\"the most spectacular act of rebellion against slavery\\" among the Cherokee, the 1842 event inspired subsequent slave rebellions in the Indian Territory.Tiya Miles, Ties that Bind: The Story of an Afro-Cherokee Family in Slavery and Freedom, University of California Press, 2005, pp. 170‚Äì73 But, in the aftermath of this escape, the Cherokee Nation passed stricter slave codes, expelled freedmen from the territory, and established a 'rescue' (slave-catching) company to try to prevent additional losses.  Background  Prior to European contact, the Cherokee had a practice of enslaving prisoners of war from other Indian tribes. In the late 18th century, some Cherokee set up European-American style plantations on their Cherokee Nation land, which occupied territory near parts of Georgia and Tennessee. They purchased African-American slaves to work this land. In 1819, the Cherokee Nation passed slave codes that regulated slave trade; forbade intermarriage; enumerated punishment for runaway slaves; and prohibited slaves from owning private property. An 1820 law regulated trading with slaves, requiring that anyone who traded with a slave without the master's permission was bound to the legal owner for the property, or its value, if the traded property proved to be stolen. Another code declared that a fine of fifteen dollars was to be levied for masters who allowed slaves to buy or sell liquor. The Cherokee adopted the practice of using enslaved African Americans on their plantations from European Americans. Most Cherokee held fewer slaves and labored with them at subsistence agriculture. Slaves worked primarily as agricultural laborers, cultivating both cotton for their master's profit and food for consumption. Some slaves were skilled laborers, such as seamstresses and blacksmiths. Like other slaveholders, affluent Cherokee used slaves as a portable labor force. They developed robust farms, salt mines, and trading posts created with slave labor. The Cherokee brought many of their slaves with them to the West in the Indian Removal of the 1820s and 1830s, when the federal government forcibly removed them from the Southeastern states. Joseph Vann was described as taking 200 slaves with him. Black slaves in each of the tribes performed much of the physical labor involved in the removal. For example, they loaded wagons, cleared the roads, and led the teams of livestock along the way. By 1835, the time of removal, the Cherokee owned an estimated total of 1500 slaves of African ancestry (the most black slaves of any of the Five Civilized Tribes). Within five years of removal, 300 mixed-race Cherokee families, most descendants of European traders and Cherokee women for generations, made up an elite class in the Indian Territory. Most owned 25‚Äì50 slaves each. Some of their plantations had 600 to 1,000 acres; cultivating wheat, cotton, corn, hemp, and tobacco. Most of the men also had large cattle and horse herds.William Gerald McLoughlin (1993). Chapter: \\"Slave holding and anti slavery efforts, 1846‚Äì1855\\", in After the Trail of Tears: The Cherokees' Struggle for Sovereignty, 1839‚Äì1880, University of North Carolina Press. pp. 121‚Äì53. By 1860, the Cherokee held an estimated 4,600 slaves, and depended on them as farm laborers and domestic servants. At the time of the Civil War, a total of more than 8,000 slaves were held in all of the Indian Territory, where they comprised 14 percent of the population.\\"Slavery\\" , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Oklahoma Historical Society, Retrieved November 14, 2010 Events of the revolt The mass escape of 20 enslaved African Americans from the Cherokee territory began on November 15, 1842, and has been called \\"the most spectacular act of rebellion against slavery\\" among the Cherokee. Most of the 20 slaves were from the plantations of \\"Rich Joe\\" Vann and his father James; they gathered and raided local stores for weapons, ammunition, horses, and mules. Escaping from Webbers Falls without casualties, the slaves headed south for Mexico, where slavery had been prohibited since 1836. Along the way they picked up another 15 slaves escaping from Creek territory. Some Cherokee and Creek pursued the fugitives, but the slaves partially held them off. In one altercation, 14 slaves were either killed or captured, but the remaining 21 continued south. The Cherokee and Creek pursuers returned to their nations for reinforcements. Along the way, the fugitives encountered two slave catchers, James Edwards, a white man, and Billy Wilson, a Lenape (Delaware Indian), who were returning to Choctaw territory with an escaped slave family of three adults and five children. The family had been headed west into Plains Indian territory. The fugitive party killed the bounty hunters to free the slave family. Together they continued South, slowed somewhat by traveling with five children.Art T. Burton, \\"Slave Revolt of 1842\\" , Oklahoma Encyclopedia of History and Culture, accessed 14 February 2014 On November 17, the Cherokee National Council in Tahlequah passed a resolution authorizing Cherokee Militia Captain John Drew to raise a company of 100 citizens to \\"pursue, arrest, and deliver the African Slaves to Fort Gibson.\\" (The resolution also relieved the government of the Cherokee Nation of any liability if the slaves resisted arrest and had to be killed.) The commander at Fort Gibson loaned Drew 25 pounds of gunpowder for the militia. The large force caught up with the slaves seven miles north of the Red River on November 28. The tired fugitives, weak from hunger, offered no resistance. They were forced to return to their owners in the Choctaw, Creek and Cherokee reservations. The Cherokee later executed five slaves for the murders of Edwards and Wilson. Vann put most of his surviving slaves to work on his steamboats, shoveling coal. The slave revolt inspired future slave rebellions in the Indian Territory. By 1851, a total of nearly 300 blacks had tried to escape from Indian Territory.Art T. Burton, \\"Cherokee Slave Revolt in 1842,\\" True West Magazine (June 1996) Most headed for Mexico or the area of the future Kansas Territory, where residents prohibited slavery. Economic impact Indian slaveholders bought and sold slaves, often doing business with white slaveholders in the neighboring states of Texas and Arkansas. The owners in both areas always considered enslaved Africans to be property. After the revolt, the Cherokee often hired non-slave holding Indians to catch runaway slaves. In the past, some of these people had struggled to eat, while slave- owning families flourished in a market economy driven by slave labor. Some among these once poor Cherokee became wealthy by providing services to the 'rescue' company in catching fugitive slaves. When slave catching expeditions were mounted, such trackers were paid. They were also authorized to buy ammunition and supplies for the hunt, at the expense of the Nation (provided that the expedition was not \\"unnecessarily protracted and did not incur needless expenses\\"). Outcome The slave revolt had threatened the security of the labor force and owners' profits. The Nation passed a stricter slave code and required expulsion of free blacks from the territory, as they were considered to foster discontent among slaves. After the American Civil War, planters and the upper class of the Cherokee Nation shifted from plantation agriculture to developing manufacture of small-scale products, which were sold internally, instead of being exported. As a mass escape that resulted in casualties and deaths of both slaves and others, the 1842 slave revolt was widely reported by newspapers. Even 50 years later, when the Fort Smith Elevator of Arkansas published an anniversary article about the escape, the account had a kind of mythic power. It recounted a morning when Cherokee slaveholders could not find their slaves and said that \\"hundreds\\" had disappeared overnight, rather than the 20 of fact.

As a mathematician, Breusch was known for his new proof of the prime number theorem. and for the many solutions he provided to problems posed in the American Mathematical Monthly. His thesis work combined Bertrand's postulate with Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions by showing that each of the progressions 3i + 1, 3i + 2, 4i + 1, and 4i + 3 (for i = 0, 1, 2, ...) contains a prime number between x and 2x for every x ‚â• 7...

Its financial situation and history of questionable loans are a factor in the campaign of Alexi Giannoulias in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Illinois. It was founded in by Alexis Giannoulias, a Greek immigrant. His sons, Demetris Giannoulias and Alexi Giannoulias, were also heavily involved in the bank. Demetris eventually became a senior officer, and Alexi was a vice president and senior loan officer from 2002 to 2006. By 2010, Demetris was CEO. 21st century In 2002, Broadway Bank made a one million dollar loan to Loren Billings, using her building on West Washington Street in Chicago as collateral; the building was both her home and the Museum of Holography, which she had founded in the 1970s. In 2006, her son sued the bank, claiming that she had dementia; the bank won the suit in Cook County court in 2008 but, , the case was being pursued by the son in appellate court. Among people with bank accounts at Broadway were Barack Obama, Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, and Chicago alderman Walter Burnett, Jr. In 2006, Broadway Bank was considered very successful, and less than 0.5% of its loan portfolio was 90 days overdue. Alexi Giannoulias left Broadway Bank in 2006 when he was elected Illinois State Treasurer. While state treasurer, he won the Democratic primary in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Illinois, making him the Democratic candidate for Barack Obama's former U.S. Senate seat. Collapse By 2009, Broadway Bank had become burdened with bad loans. On January 26, 2010, the bank agreed to restrictions from state and federal banking regulators: ending dividend payments to the Giannoulias family without regulatory approval, hiring outsiders to evaluate the senior management, adding $19 million to its reserves, raising another $50 million within 90 days to achieve its promised capital ratio, and adopting a less risky investment strategy. CFO Kaushik Pancholi, noting that Broadway has previously \\"been one of the most profitable banks in Illinois\\", noted \\"certain investments that were rated triple-A by rating agencies when purchased, but have lost significant value over the past year.\\" At the end of business on Friday, , the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Division of Banking, seized Broadway Bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. The FDIC in turn named MB Financial Bank as the institution receiving Broadway Bank's deposit accounts. The FDIC announced that it and MB Financial Bank would share $878.4 million in losses, for a cost of $394.3 million to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund.

Established in 1963, the school serves students in grades 9-12. History Lake County led the state with the first county high school in 1900, when the court voted to establish a high school in Tiptonville, which would be free to all students in the county. The $7,500.00 needed to build the school was raised by public subscription. The two-story brick building was built on Church Street on what is now used as the cemetery. An annex was added for the elementary grades. In 1925, a new school with both room for high and elementary school was built on Cherry Street. It hosted a large auditorium and under it a large room where the first hot lunch program was started by the P.T.A. in the late 1930s. In 1963, a consolidated high school was built in Tiptonville to accommodate students from Tiptonville and Ridgely High Schools and later Lincoln High School. Mr. Ellis Truett was the first principal of Lake County High School and guided it through the early years of consolidation and integration. In 1967, the first black students entered LCHS. Lake County High School is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Campus Curriculum Lake County High School offers a comprehensive curriculum with tracks for university preparation and technical career preparation. Students may enroll in dual-credit college coursework with the University of Tennessee at Martin. Vocational courses at the school include business, carpentry, criminal justice, family and consumer sciences, health science, and leisure craft (small engines). Extracurricular activities Student groups and activities include Beta Club, cheerleading, dance team, FBLA, FCCLA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Band, Art, student council, Upward Bound, and yearbook. The school's athletic teams, known as the Lake County Falcons, compete in Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association size classification A, district 14. Teams are fielded in baseball, basketball, football, volleyball and softball. The Falcons' football team won the TSSAA Class A State Championship in 1980, 1985, and 2019. Lake County won its first boys' basketball state championship in 2011. The team finished the season 26-10, were led by first-year head coach Dawn Barger. She is believed to be the first female to coach a boys' basketball team to a state championship.

Naumburg Foundation. It is a competition for young pianists, of ages 17 to 32, organized in New York City, United States since 1926. It is one of the oldest music competitions in the world, and it has helped launch the career of some of the 20th century's greatest pianists, such as Jorge Bolet, William Kapell, Abbey Simon, Theodore Lettvin, Constance Keene, Adele Marcus, Kun-Woo Paik, Andre-Michel Schub and Stephen Hough, among many others. Because of its rich and long history, it is considered one of the most prestigious contests of its kind in the world. It has been described by the New York Times as \\"in its quiet way, the most prestigious of them all.\\" New York Times, February 5, 1991 The piano competition is dedicated to the ideals set out by Walter Naumburg, as are the other Foundation-sponsored competitions and awards in solo and chamber music performance, composer recordings, conducting and commissions. Naumburg believed that such competitions were not only for the benefit of new stars, but would encourage talented young artists to become prime movers in the development of the highest standards of musical excellence throughout the world. The solo competition disciplines rotate from year to year, encompassing piano, violin, cello and voice. The piano competition is currently held every five years. The winner usually receives a cash prize, a string of performances, management, a recording contract, and New York City debuts in the city's most important classical music venues. In recent years, the Foundation office has undertaken to manage new winners for two seasons or until a commercial manager emerges to take them on.

History The church was founded in 1125 by Martino Doria, as the private chapel of his family. In 1278 it was totally renewed in Gothic style. The building was again renovated in the mid-16th century by order of Andrea Doria, who commissioned the work to Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli (changes included the presbytery and the dome). It was further renovated in 1557‚Äì1559, under design by Giovanni Battista Castello (nave and aisles) and decoration, realized by Luca Cambiaso among the others. Description Of the Gothic building, the nave, aisles and the fa√ßade are in white (marble) and black (slate) stripes, divided into three sectors by fake columns with Lombard bands; in the center is a large rose window, while on the sides are two double mullioned windows. The fa√ßade includes a late Roman sarcophagus with an Allegory of the Autumn, which originally was used as the tomb of Lamba Doria, who had taken it to Genoa from Korƒçula in Dalmatia. At one time, large chains, which once had protected the harbor of Pisa and which had been obtained as booty after the victory at the Battle of Meloria (1284), were draped across the facade. In the 19th century, they were returned to Pisa.Carden, RW. p232-233 On the left side of the church is the cloister of St. Matthew, of quadrangular plan, dating to 1308. It has ogival arches on double small columns. Artworks of the interior include the Miracle of the Ethiopian Dragon by Luca Cambiaso and the Vocation of St. Matthew by Giovanni Battista Castello, a wooden \\"Deposition\\" by Anton Maria Maragliano, and the tomb of Andrea Doria, executed by Montorsoli, in the crypt. At the high altar is a Holy Family with St. Anne by Bernardo Castello (16th century). According to the tradition, the sword housed under the altar belonged to Andrea Doria, and was donated to this church by Pope Paul III. The church has an original organ, constructed by Antonio Alari in 1773. Notes Sources The City of Genoa (1908) by Robert Walter Carden; Publisher Methuen and Co., 36 Essex St. W.C.

Alloys used for the production of other alloys The most common commercial niobium alloys are ferroniobium and nickel-niobium, produced by thermite reduction of appropriate mixtures of the oxides; these are not usable as engineering materials, but are used as convenient sources of niobium for specialist steels and nickel-based superalloys. Going via an iron-niobium or nickel-niobium alloy avoids problems associated with the high melting point of niobium. Superconducting alloys Niobium-tin and Niobium-titanium are essential alloys for the industrial use of superconductors, since they remain superconducting in high magnetic fields (30T for Nb3Sn, 15T for NbTi); there are 1200 tons of NbTi in the magnets of the Large Hadron Collider, whilst Nb3Sn is used in the windings of almost all hospital MRI machines. =Aerospace rivets= Niobium-titanium alloy, of the same composition as the superconducting one, is used for rivets in the aerospace industry; it is easier to form than CP titanium, and stronger at elevated (> 300¬∞C) temperatures. Refractory alloys Niobium-1% zirconium is used in rocketry and in the nuclear industry. It is regarded as a low-strength alloy. C-103, which is 89% Nb, 10% Hf and 1% Ti, was used for the rocket nozzle of the Apollo service module; it is regarded as a medium-strength alloy. High- strength alloys include C-129Y (10% tungsten, 10% hafnium, 0.1% yttrium, balance niobium), Cb-752 (10% tungsten, 2.5% zirconium), and the even higher strength C-3009 (61% niobium, 30% hafnium, 9% tungsten); these can be used at temperatures up to 1650¬∞C with acceptable strength, though are expensive and hard to form. Niobium alloys in general are inconvenient to weld: both sides of the weld must be protected with a stream of inert gas, because hot niobium will react with oxygen and nitrogen in the air. It is also necessary to take care (e.g. hard chrome-plating of all copper tooling) to avoid copper contamination.

The hamlet lies about northeast of Devizes town centre. In April 2017, Roundway civil parish was abolished and became a ward of Devizes parish, owing to housing development to the north, east and south of the town. In the census of 2001 Roundway parish had a population of 2,267, increasing to 5,290 at the census of 2011. Roundway ward is located in the north, east and southwest of Devizes, and on the north side lies off the A361, which passes from Devizes to Swindon. On the southwest side it is accessible by the A360 Salisbury ‚Äì Devizes Road, and by the A342. The small hamlet of Roundway lies just to the north of this, towards the White Horse. The north part of Roundway provides a bypass from the north of Devizes to the west through Conscience Lane. Towards the south of the ward is the former hamlet of Nursteed, now a contiguous suburb of Devizes. Most of the land surrounding Roundway is agricultural and to the north of the hamlet is Roundway Hill, a popular place for walking and kite and model aircraft flying. The hill has round barrows which are scheduled monuments. Governance The ward elects six councillors to Devizes parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The civil parish was created in 1894; until then it was part of Bishops Cannings parish in the Potterne and Cannings hundred. Following a community governance review in 2016, Roundway became a ward of Devizes parish; at the same time there were minor boundary changes, so that the Northfields area is wholly within Bishop Cannings parish, while the Hopton industrial estate is wholly within Roundway ward. An electoral ward with the same name exists. At the 2011 census the population was 4,514. Amenities The ward has two primary schools: The Trinity Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School (to the north) and Nursteed Community Primary School (towards the south). The Kennet and Avon canal crosses the ward. Roundway Down and Covert is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The former parish has no church and is served by churches in Devizes and Bishops Cannings. Devizes White Horse A chalk hill figure of a horse was created in the hill above Roundway hamlet in September 1999 to celebrate the millennium. It replaces the white horse of Devizes (Snob's Horse) that was lost after 1845. Oliver's Castle Oliver Cromwell is mistakenly thought to have fought at the Battle of Roundway Down in 1643, hence the alternative name for the Roundway Downs, 'Olivers Castle'. Former Roundway Hospital, now residences Roundway Hospital A large Victorian psychiatric hospital stood in the south of the parish and served Wiltshire until it was closed in 1995, following a decision to close it in 1989. The mental health services were transferred to the newly built Green Lane hospital on part of the same site. Notable buildings Roundway House, in the north of the ward, is a Grade II listed building that is the remains of the 18th century building in the former Roundway Park. The property was last owned privately by the Colston family who sold it in 1948. It was demolished in 1955 leaving the stable block which was improved and is now used for social functions. Le Marchant Barracks, on the A361, was used by the army (primarily the Wiltshire Regiment) from 1878 until the 1980s. The keep was converted for residential use in 2013. Notable people Members of the Colston family at Roundway Park include Charles (1854‚Äì1925), High Sheriff of Wiltshire and member of parliament, who became Baron Roundway in 1916; and his son Edward (1880‚Äì1944), army officer in the Boer War and World War I. Henry Billington (1908‚Äì1980), tennis player, was born in Roundway and is the maternal grandfather of tennis player Tim Henman.

Description = Shell = The shell of Marginella gemmula, while glossy and smooth to the touch, has spires that can be anywhere from flat to moderately elevated. Most shells have various colors, but a small number can be colorless. On the outside of the shell, the columella has four plaits. The outside lip is thicker than other such creatures, and the inside of the shell sports a denticulate set of teeth and/or folds. Unlike other gastropods, Marginella gemmula's siphonal canal is not very deep, but is still present. There is no operculum present with Marginella gemmula. = Flesh = The head of Marginella gemmula is bifurcated, with the siphon extending behind it. When moving, the foot of the animal extends past the shell.

The goal of EPF is to coordinate, inform about and support the development of polymer science in Europe. As of June 2011 EPF has 24 full members and 5 associate members from 27 countries.http://www.europolyfed.org/ official site Major activities of EPF is the organization of the European Polymer Congress, conferences, workshops and summer schools, and publishing of e-Polymers - the first on-line peer-reviewed journal in the area of polymer science EPF is led by its chairman, general secretary, executive committee and general assembly. EPF is a non-profit organization. European Polymer Congress The European Polymer Congress is a biannual conference organized by the European Polymer Federation. The event has become one of the largest polymer science conferences in the world. The program of the European Polymer Congress encompasses all aspects of polymer science. Traditionally it is organized in the June‚ÄìJuly period and lasts for 5‚Äì6 days. European Polymer Conferences attract upward from 1000 researchers from academia and industry. The event is organized in the country of the current EPF Chairman. e-Polymers e-Polymers is a peer-reviewed internet journal under the auspices of the European Polymer Federation. In the area of polymer science and engineering, it makes novel scientific and technological results available both in academia and industry, and basically free of charge. It has become a respected journal with an ISI impact factor and is followed by major indices.http://www.e-polymers.org/ official site EUPOC Conferences Starting from 1998 the European Polymer Federation began organizing Europolymer Conferences (EUPOC) on topics of actual scientific and industrial interest. EUPOC Conferences are small meetings attracting up to 100 participants. The conferences are organized by representatives of the Italian Polymer Society and the traditional venue of the conferences is the Palazzo Feltrinelli in Gargnano (Italy), along the Garda Lake, which is generously made available by the University of Milano. The scientific program consists of invited lectures, oral communications and posters. Ample space is given to the free discussion favored by the residential style of the Conference. Abstracts of accepted papers are collected in a proceedings book which is distributed to all registered delegates.

He was a cand.jur. (jurist) by education. After first serving as local magistrate in Mandal, Norway he joined the Norwegian Foreign Service in 1979, after establishing Norway's consular visa office in Islamabad, Pakistan on behalf of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice in 1977. Before completing his admission to the diplomatic ranks he worked for Norwegian Refugee Council providing emergency aid for arriving Afghan refugees in Pakistan after the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. His first posting for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from 1981 to 1984, was as Secretary of Embassy at the Norwegian embassy in Jakarta. He was then transferred to West Berlin where he served as military attach√© in the allied occupational forces in West Berlin between 1984-1987. In 1989 he returned to Islamabad, Pakistan where he served as charge d'affairs until 1995. Between 1995-1998 he was assistant secretary and sub-director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1998 to 2003 he served as the Norway¬¥s ambassador to Indonesia. When East Timor became independent in 2002, he received responsibility for that country too, after being heavily involved in supporting the fledgling nation and developing deep personal relationships with East Timor's leaders, Ramos Horta and Xanana Gusm√£o. In 1999 he was decorated as a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit. After the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Torgersen was tasked with operating the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' crisis aid to Norwegian tourists in the area. Shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with cancer and died in September 2005.

Located northwest of the unincorporated community of Oregonia, the mound sits in an area of light woodland.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1372. At a height of and a diameter of , it is believed to have been built by people of the Fort Ancient culture. Although it has never been excavated, multiple confirmed Fort Ancient sites, including mounds and two cemeteries, are located within of the Bone Mound II. The closest of these sites, a rare cemetery composed of limestone burial vaults, is only about away. The Fort Ancient people are known to have used burial vaults, pits, and two types of mounds for the burial of their dead. However, most areas with such a high concentration of Fort Ancient sites employ only a single method of burial. Because the area around the Bone Mound II shows evidence of multiple methods of burial, it may have been occupied by multiple foci of the Fort Ancient people; consequently, the region is very valuable archaeologically. On July 15, 1974, the Bone Mound II was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its potential to be an archaeological site. The Bone Stone Graves, the cemetery with limestone vaults, was listed on the Register on the same day.

The separation between the genera Prunum and Volvarina is not very precise. They form together a monophyletic clade. The differences between these two genera are based on differences in the morphology of the shell, the radula, the radular cartilage, the mantle and the internal anatomy.Jeremy B.C. Jackson, Scott Lidgard, and Frank K. McKinney, Evolutionary patterns : growth, form and tempo in the fossil record, The University of Chicago Press, 2001 A rather arbitrary criterion is currently used to distinguish between the two genera.

It was shot in Goa. Deepika Padukone makes a special appearance in the remix version of the hit song \\"Dum Maro Dum\\". The music has been composed by Pritam. This is the first time a Bollywood film has been mixed in Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound. Plot The film starts with a footballer, Lawrence \\"Lorry\\" Gomes (Prateik Babbar), who gets admission into an American college. Due to insufficient funds, he is unable to fulfill his dream. On the other hand, his girlfriend Tani (Anaitha Nair) got a scholarship to US. Though he is happy for his girlfriend's achievement, he becomes depressed for not fulfilling his own dream. His friend Ricky (Gulshan Devaiah) tells him that he can get him into the college, but Lorry will have to smuggle drugs along with him. Lorry agrees and at the airport, successfully passes the X-ray machine. ACP Vishnu Kamath (Abhishek Bachchan) is a previously corrupt cop who had accepted a lot of bribes to satisfy his family. However, his family died in a car accident. Several years later, he is offered a job by the Chief Minister of Goa: to flush out all the drug dealers in Goa, which he accepts. His success leads to a panic among the drug suppliers. The drug dealers gather for a meeting led by Zoey Mendosa (Bipasha Basu). Zoey guarantees them that their drugs will be in safe hands if they are given to a mysterious person named Michael Barbosa. Kamath decides to chase Michael Barbosa and finds out about Ricky. When Kamath reaches Ricky, he is already dead. Kamath finds out about his cocaine- smuggling and his girlfriend, Rozanna (Mariah Pucu Gantois Gomes). They reach the airport on the same day Lorry is about to leave. Kamath encounters Rozanna and finds a photo of Lorry in her phone. She is allowed to go due to lack of evidence. Kamath then identifies Lorry as the person he had seen in Rozanna's phone. They detain him and find cocaine stuffed in his bag. Lorry is sent to juvenile jail, where his friend, DJ Joaquim \\"Joki\\" Fernandes (Rana Daggubati), tries to get him out. It is then revealed that Zoey and Joki used to be in a relationship. Zoey wanted to be an air hostess, but failed. Joki introduced her to his boss, Lorsa Biscuita a.k.a. the Biscuit (Aditya Pancholi), who had worldwide contacts. With the help of his contacts, Biscuit got her a job in airlines, though she had to smuggle cocaine to international regions to repay him. She ended up getting caught and was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Biscuit's contact got her free in 14 days, but to repay him, she had to sleep with Biscuit. She broke up with Joki and made her life drug-dealing with Biscuit. Joki meets Zoey and the two end up sleeping together. Zoey gives him a video of Biscuit announcing that he is going to have a rave in neighboring Karnataka, out of Kamath's jurisdiction and that Michael Barbosa will be bringing and exchanging drugs. Joki gives this tape to Kamath. When Biscuit comes to know about Zoey and Joki, he kills Zoey. After recruiting Lorry for help, Kamath attacks Biscuit's party and arrests the drug dealers. When Kamath's colleague Rane asks him about Barbosa, Kamath says that he knows the secret of Barbosa and Rane kills Kamath. It is revealed that Rane was always involved with Biscuit. Joki later finds out about Kamath's death and arrives at the crime scene, fitting together the pieces as Kamath has. Michael Barbosa is not a man but a gravesite Biscuit uses for storing drugs. We see Joki carefully storing the bags of cocaine somewhere, then calling Rane to arrange a meeting. Lorry is now free of the charge and he comes out of jail. When Joki and Rane are going to meet Biscuit, Joki kills Rane saying that he knows Rane is the person who killed Kamath. Kamath's body is being cremated in an electric furnace owned by Biscuit. We see that this is where Joki has put the drugs, and Biscuit arrives only too late. Having been brought down by the destruction of his stockpile, Biscuit is killed by a woman who may be Rozanna. Lorry comes to a beach party where Joki is singing, and Tani joins him in a joyful reunion. The film ends with Joki on his bike, riding off into the sunset remembering Kamath and Zoey.

The Times of India, which gave a three and a half rating, mentioned that \\"The film slags in places and needs tightening, but the lull is followed by a tangy twist in the tale, which makes up for the occasional yawn. Shridhar Raghavan writes a thrilling cops and robbers tale which has some quirky banter scripted by Purva Naresh. Add to this Goa captured in glowing colours by cinematographer Amit Roy and a peppy music score by Pritam, and director Rohan Sippy gives you a film that keeps the popcorn crackling, till the very end\\". The Filmfare gave a four star rating stating \\"Dum Maaro Dum has a taut narrative that doesn't flail till post interval. It keeps you engrossed through an imaginative blend of some stupendous background music, animated cinematography and simple effective storytelling. The characters are introduced with clarity and soon you get a very clear picture of what's going with whom. As for the performances Abhishek does an earnest and impressive job. Rana Daggubati sure has an impressive screen presence but we must wait to find out if that dead pan expression is restricted only to this film. Pratik looks dazed and you don't want to take your eyes off him when he is on screen. Bipasha looks suitably traumatised\\". Anupama Chopra of NDTV gave a two and half star rating saying \\"Dum Maaro Dum has all the ingredients of crackling entertainment. This is one film that should soar but sadly it never quite takes flight. The problem is the writing. has some punchy dialogue-baazi and snazzy action, especially a nicely done shoot-out at a night market. It also features Abhishek's best performance in recent times. But the narrative slumps in places, the plot has loopholes and the characters just aren't convincing enough to grab you. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama rated the film two and half and noted \\"Film is like fast food that's high on calories, but falls short in the nutrition department. Yes, it's slick, stylish and well-crafted, but the fact remains that it lacks the power [in its second hour specifically] to create a dum-daar impression. however praised the lead performances. Abhishek is super in the role of a tough cop whose life undergoes a U-turn when personal tragedy strikes. Much of the joy comes from watching Rana Daggubati infuse believability into his character. He's easy on the eyes and is a complete natural when it comes to acting. Bipasha shines in several moments of the film. Daily News & Analysis gave a three star rating saying \\"With the body of a modern thriller and the soul of a 1970s masala film, the idea behind the hybridization had potential, but 'Dum Maaro Dum' falls slightly short \\". Nevertheless, it still recommended the film. Hindustan Times reviewer Mayank Shankar gave it a three star rating and noted \\"It just about makes for an enticing thriller here. There's probably an even better film when compressed.\\" India Today reviewer Kaveree Bamzai gave a three and half rating said that the movie is \\"With some cutting edge background music and a haunting song by Papon which remains in your head, Dum Maaro Dum is a stylish thriller written as smartly as it is directed\\". Rajeev Masand of CNN IBN gave it a two star rating explaining \\" It's watchable, but it could easily have been so much more. The action sequences add style to the story, with more than one smartly-filmed chase scene. The dialogues too pack quite a punch, before it all starts to feel too much. In the end, it's Abhishek Bachchan who throws you with his sheer presence. He plays Kamath with just the right amount of steely nerve and naked emotions. Unfortunately it isn't enough to lift this film from an average drugs-drama to a smart and entertaining action thriller. It's got its moments, but they're few and far between\\". Gaurav Malani of Indiatimes gave it a positive review, saying, \\"In the bigger picture, the story of Dum Maaro Dum isn't something one hasn't witnessed before. A corrupt cop turns honest on losing his family. He is summoned to purify a polluted province. A white-collared kingpin operates at large in the region. An innocent chap is engulfed in the nexus. The cop has to liberate the innocent and convict the guilty. Doesn't this sound like a standard scheme of an 80s potboiler? But what makes Rohan Sippy's film entertaining is its smart storytelling, sincere setting and slick treatment.\\" He also praised Abhishek's performance, saying that his childhood friend Rohan Sippy clearly knows how to best use the actor. Tushar Joshi of mid-day entertainment gave it three stars out of five. He criticized the film for its length and was unimpressed by Bipasha's performance, saying that she was lacklustre. But he added that for all its drawbacks, the film is nevertheless worth a watch because of its gripping storyline and stylish treatment of the same. Deepauk Murugesan of New Indian express praised the film, commenting, \\"At its core, Rohan Sippy's film is about two love stories coming together to salvage the future of a third. It is a uniquely male fantasy and grossly idealistic, but its excess is well cloaked in the blood-soaked grittiness that permeates the film.\\" Pankaj Sabnani of Glamsham gave it three stars out of five, calling it \\"a 'dumdar' thriller with a riveting plot and splendid performances.\\" =Box office= Dum Maaro Dum managed a decent opening weekend of 165 million in India and 63 million in the overseas market. After four weeks, the film grossed 318.4 million in India. In India Dum Maaro Dum has managed to gross 326 million (appx). It has released across 1200 screen. Reportedly, the film has fared well in the southern territories like Andhra Pradesh, Nizam, Mysore and Karnataka. At the International Box Office, Dum Maaro Dum collected $1.4 million approximately. In US the film earned $360,000, UK ‚Äì $157,000, Mid-East ‚Äì $300,000 and Australia ‚Äì NZ ‚Äì $150,000. The film was declared \\"sleeper hit\\" by Box Office India. According to Vijay Singh, the CEO of Fox Star Studios, the film \\"recovered its cost of production of Rs 310 million in the first weekend from theatrical (domestic and International), music (including overflows) and satellite, thus ensuring it to be a profitable venture.\\" The film grossed worldwide. Controversy There was controversy over the theme of the film. One particular promotional dialogue from the film \\"Liquor is cheap here and women are even cheaper here\\" caused quite a stir. Media professional Savio Rodrigues filed a petition to Goa Bench of Bombay High Court seeking a permanent ban on the movie stating that the wrong portrayal might attract sex offenders, drug launderers and criminals to Goa. Soundtrack Director Rohan Sippy launched the song Dum Maaro Dum during the 2011 India ‚Äì South Africa ICC Cricket World Cup match on 12 March 2011. The music of the film has been composed by Pritam.

In August‚ÄìOctober 1950 Austria faced a severe social and economic crisis caused by anticipated withdrawal of American financial aid and a sharp drop in real wages. Negotiations between the government and the trade unions stalled, and on September 26 the Communists launched the first general strike. A total of 120 thousand industrial workers walked out of factories, disrupted railroad traffic and harassed government officers. Austrian government, the Socialists and trade unions defused the situation and on September 27 the Communists backed off. The second strike of October 4‚Äì5, limited to Vienna and Soviet- occupied Lower Austria, also ended in a humiliating defeat. The Soviet support to Austrian Communists was limited to the disruption of police action and provision of trucks for moving communist agents. The British and American occupation forces provided only moral support to the Austrian government. All former allies evaded use of force. No one was killed but dozens of police officers and civilians were injured in street fights. The strikes of 1950 are routinely called a putschCf. the title of corresponding chapter in Bader. but actual goals of the Communists remain unknown. According to contemporary American press, the August strikes were \\"the most widespread and potentially dangerous since the end of World War II\\".MacCormack, John (1950, October 7). Soviet Forces Pull Back from Austrian Showdown. The New York Times (paid access). Historians agreed: \\"the developing strike was the most dangerous since the end of the war\\" (Bader),Bader, p. 165. \\"few Cold War confrontations in Austria were more potentially explosive than the Communist-inspired strikes of September and October 1950\\" (Williams).Williams, p. 115. Crisis of 1950 Allied occupation zones in Austria After the conclusion of World War II the territory of Austria, annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, was once again separated from Germany and placed under administration of France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1949 they agreed on two- thirds of the draft of the Austrian State Treaty but its very future was vague, as had been shown by the partition of Germany.Williams, p. 118. By summer of 1950 lack of progress with the Treaty and the communist scare of the Korean War had a grave impact on the Austrians' morale.Williams, pp. 119-120. Allied-occupied Austria was split into four occupation zones. The Soviet Union controlled the provinces of Lower Austria, Burgenland and eastern districts of Upper Austria, but the city of Vienna, which lies within Lower Austria, was occupied by all four allies. Austrian heavy industry (or what was left of it) concentrated around Linz, in the American zone, and in British-occupied Styria. Their products were in high demand in post-war Europe. Quite naturally, the administrators of the Marshall Plan channelled available financial aid into heavy industry controlled by the American and British forces.Bader, p. 160. Industry quickly recovered, from 74.7% of pre-war output in 1948 to 150.7% in 1951.Bader, p. 160, uses 1937 as the base year (100%). American planners deliberately neglected consumer goods industries, construction trades and small business. Their workers, almost half of Austrian industrial workforce, suffered from rising unemployment.Bader, pp. 160-161. Agriculture remained in ruin, and Austria relied on food imports from the West. In 1948‚Äì1949 substantial share of Marshall Plan funds allocated to Austria was used to subsidize imports of food. American money, effectively, raised real wages of Austrian workers: grain price in Austria was at about one-third of the world price.Williams, p. 122. Farmers were depressed by artificially low prices; the Americans were not happy about it too and planned to cut off food subsidies by the end of 1950. Austrian coalition government chaired by Leopold Figl was facing an impending social and economic crisis. They had to manage it alone, without allied support and without financial reserves to smooth the transition. Austrian finances were ruined by post-war hyperinflation. In 1947‚Äì1949 the government and organized labor maintained real wages through annual adjustment of wages to prices. The first two price- wage agreements relieved social tension, but by the time of the third price- wage agreement (1949) failures of this mechanism were obvious.Bader, pp. 161-162. The Communist Party of Austria made the alleged \\"ripoff of workers\\" in 1949 a staple of their campaigningWilliams, p. 121. and blamed the very existence of wage-price agreements on American influence.Bischof et al., pp. 149-150. The fourth price-wage agreement, negotiated in secrecy in August 1950, ended in a deadlock. The unions expected that the government will pick up the food bill previously paid by the Americans. The government could not afford it, and was persuading the unions to accept a sharp drop in real wages. The farmers demanded a raise in food price caps.Williams, p. 122, wrote that farmers' action in July‚ÄìAugust was a direct precursor to the September crisis. The Korean War raised worldwide prices of coal, fertilizers and other vital imported commodities. The public remained unaware of the depth of the crisis altogether until the first week of September when the farmers refused to deliver their produce to the cities at old prices. The coalition government plunged into protracted public debates between different interest groups and failed to reach a consensus.Bader, p. 164. As public anxiety mounted, Austrian Communists, who had recently lost municipal elections even in the Soviet zone,MacCormack, John (1950, May 7). Red Mayors Losing in Lower Austria. The New York Times (paid access). grabbed the opportunity and demanded a 15% \\"straight wage increase with prices frozen\\". September 24, 1950, communist press announced the upcoming general strike.Bader, pp. 165-167. In case of a conflict they counted on support from the Werkschutz, the paramilitary factory guard employed by the USIA and manned by communists.Bischof et al., p. 146. First strike Leader of Austrian Communists Johann Koplenig (1963 photo). Tuesday, September 26, 1950, the strike began in earnest. It could become the greatest challenge to the Second Republic had it been supported by the Soviet Union. In the morning the communist agents in the Soviet occupation zone in Vienna went from factory to factory, recruiting supporters among disgruntled workers. By 10:00 they mobilized around fifteen thousand demonstrators and marched south into the center of Vienna. According to the French High Commissioner, 99% of them worked in the Soviet zone.Williams, p. 129. Police of the Soviet zone did not interfere, the American High Commission stayed aside, the Austrian Minister of the Interior deliberately disarmed his forces in fear of Soviet provocations. The crowd of seven thousand pressed its way through police barricades and rallied in front of the Federal Chancellery building at the time of the Cabinet meeting. Figl refused to speak to the demonstrators, and by 13:00 they left the square. No shots were fired but 23 unarmed police officers were wounded in clashes with the workers.Bader, pp. 167-168. Heavy industry workers in American-occupied Linz and Steyr went on strike in the afternoon. The strike in Linz was supported by both pro- communist and pro-socialist workers. Workers in British zone followed suit. In Soviet-occupied Lower Austria strike groups attempted to grab control over railroad stations and post offices, and actually overran some of the latter. Soviet forces maintained friendly neutrality although there was one incident of a Soviet tank involved in blocking the railroad. The Allied Council, chaired by an American, stayed neutral. By the end of the day 120 thousand workers were on strike;Bader, p. 173. Austrian Communists gained some ground, but, most important, they manipulated masses of Socialists into a pro- communist alliance. Socialist leaders were caught unprepared; they mobilized their network on September 27 when the Communists already hastily moved to the second phase of their plan.Bader, pp. 168-171. In the morning of Wednesday, September 27, thousands of pro-communist strike workers took control over OGB regional headquarters in Linz and Graz with their communication infrastructure. Again, the police stayed aside but the Socialists in Vienna scrambled all their resources to weaken the communist influence. By the end of the day police and paramilitary units forced the Communists out of OGB buildings in British and American zones. On September 28 the communists barely raised seventy volunteers to storm the national OGB office in Vienna, and were routed by the police. The majority of industrial workers now relied on instructions from the unions, not Communists or their Soviet mentors. By 7 p.m. of September 27 even the Soviets agreed that the strike failed and their radio program instructed Austrian workers to return to work.Bader, pp. 172-174; Williams, p. 122. On September 30 pro-communist Conference of Shop Stewards, attended by 2,417 workers' representatives,Williams, p. 123. issued an ultimatum: raise wages immediately or face another general strike on October 4.MacCormack, John (1950, September 30). Ultimatum Raised by Austrian Reds. The New York Times (paid access). The American and British commanders assessed the situation and once again told the Austrian government that their troops will not take action: their armed intervention, should it happen, \\"would mean shooting... a profound effect inside and outside Austria.\\"Williams, p. 126, cited the minutes of September 29 meeting of the Western High Commissioners. The Austrian Minister of Interior concurred: \\"intervention ... would be the end of the Austrian Government.\\"Williams, p. 126, cited report by British Commissioner Sir Harold Caccia. Second strike Oilers from the oil fields of Lower Austria (photo of 2008) formed the strike force of Austrian Communists. In the week that preceded the second strike the government and the unions actively campaigned against it. There were no doubts that without Soviet assistance the Austrian communists would fail again, but the degree of Soviet involvement was unknown. Vienna was overwhelmed by rumours of Soviet and Czechoslovak troop movements. The New York Times reported that fearful Viennese swept all available food from the stores.MacCormack, John (1950, October 3). Vienna Fears Blockading of Food In Communist Strike Call Today. The New York Times (paid access). Fears of another Berlin Blockade or even worse intensified on the eve of the strike, when the Soviets instructed Austrian police to stay off the streets and blocked the movement of gendarmes in Vienna. Austrian government responded with arrests of strike leaders in British and American zonesBader, p. 177. and with an appeal to all the workers: \\"Repel every act of terror... destroy illegal roadblocks, drive the intruders out of factories.\\".Bader, p. 179. The actual strike was limited to Vienna and Lower Austria, and involved around 19% of industrial workforce. The communists made the impact worse by disrupting railroad traffic. They stormed the Stadlau station in Donaustadt three times, were forced away three times, and then blocked the tracks until the evening. On October 5 they resumed blockade of Stadlau since 5 a.m., took control of the Nordbahnhof and threatened the S√ºdbahnhof. With the police disabled, railroads were defended by their employees and the volunteers of the \\"Olah battalion\\". They were armed with clubs, operated in small teams and engaged the Communists in hand-to-hand fighting at first opportunity. There were reports that the Soviets provided trucks to move communist crews around, but this was as far as the Soviets went in supporting the strike.Bader, pp. 177-179; Williams, pp. 123-124. On October 5 pro-communist representatives convened at another conference in Floridsdorf (Soviet zone) and admitted failure of the second strike.Williams, p. 124. Historiography After the failure of the first strike the Austrian Government presented the September events as a deliberate and planned Communist action aimed at overthrowing the government. The idea of a communist putsch has been shared by the historians although the degree of Communist planning is debated. One school of thought supports the notion of a planned and concerted efforts; another says that the Communists merely grabbed the opportunity and relied on yet unknown outcome of the strike and street violence. The third opinion clears the Communists of any long-ranging plans; according to this point of view, the strikes were just labor action.Williams, p. 131. Franz Olah, the leader of anti-communist street gangs, shared this opinion. He said that the Communists never had resources to stage a real putsch, and instead their objective was a mere increase in their representation in national and municipal governments.Williams, p. 131-132. British and American observers also believed that there were no plans for a putsch. Sir Harold Caccia wrote that the strikes were not the result of a planned putsch, and that Austrian Communists \\"never committed themselves to an all-out effort.\\"Williams, p. 135, cites letter of Caccia to Ernest Bevin of October 27, 1950. Austrian accounts of the 1950 strikes emphasize internal political struggle and downplay the Soviet involvement.Williams, p. 127. On the other side of the spectrum, Audrey Kurth Cronin argued that the events were a Soviet-inspired putsch, in fact, the second one after the 1947 food riots.Audrey Kurth Cronin, Great Power Politics and the Struggle over Austria, 1945-1955 (New York: Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 108-112.Williams, p. 126.See Bischof et al., pp. 147-148, for a review of the 1947 riot and its effect on Austrian politics. This version is backed by GRU veteran Boris Volodarsky although he did not present any new evidence to prove it. The degree of Soviet involvement and any plans entertained by the Soviets are still subject to interpretation. According to a series of interviews with unnamed witnesses published by Hugo Portisch in the 1980s, the Soviets were dissatisfied with the disruption caused by Austrian communists. The Soviets allegedly committed all resources to the Korean War and keenly evaded radical confrontation in Europe. According to Portisch, Soviet representatives in Austria were split over the 1950 strikes: some saw an opportunity to suppress the Western influence, others were unwilling to provoke the West, yet others had to meet production targets and opposed any disruption in the Soviet zone. Portisch wrote that Moscow actually intervened to defuse the situation and instructed the Soviet command in Austria to prevent any overt acts by Austrian Communists, in a way that would allow them to save face after a defeat.Williams, pp. 133-134.

He represented District 37 in Caddo and Bossier parishes in northwest Louisiana. Early years A native of Shreveport, Nelson received a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1957 from the University of Oklahoma at Norman, Oklahoma. He graduated thereafter from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. He was admitted to the Louisiana bar in 1963. In 1977, Nelson joined John L. Hammons to establish the firm Nelson & Hammons. Cornell Rushing Flournoy (female) practices in the firm with Hammons. Located a block from the Caddo Parish Courthouse, Nelson & Hammons emphasizes medical malpractice and personal injury. Legislative service In 1979, Nelson was initially elected to succeed the Conservative Democrat Jackson B. Davis, still a semi-retired Shreveport lawyer who did not seek another term that year. In 1988, during his last term in office, Nelson launched an unofficial candidacy for Senate president. The incumbent, Sammy Nunez of Chalmette in St. Bernard Parish east of New Orleans, had been a state representative first elected in 1964 and a senator since 1968. Nelson had traveled across the state for several years prior to 1988, having visited senators in their home districts in an attempt to secure commitments for Senate president.Ron Gomez, My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative, Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishing, 2000, p. 183; State Representative Ron Gomez of Lafayette, in his memoirs entitled My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative (2000), describes Nelson, accordingly: \\"Nelson, very professorial looking with his wire-rimmed glasses, was extremely meticulous in his approach to legislation. Although I thought his voting record was too liberal and trial lawyer-oriented, I liked the way he had conducted his campaign for Senate president. He was going after the presidency no matter who was elected governor [in 1987].\\"Ron Gomez, pp. 183-184 Gomez said that he learned that Nelson had asked Allen Bares, a more conservative member from Lafayette, to run for president pro-tem of the Senate in conjunction with Nelson's bid for president. \\"That way the president would be from north Louisiana, and the pro-tem from the south. Of course, [Governor Buddy] Roemer, like Nelson, was from the Shreveport area. Their meeting with Roemer was intended, of course, to get his endorsement and support [for their dual candidacies].\\"Ron Gomez, p. 184 Instead, Roemer picked Bares for Senate president and Jimmy Dimos of Ouachita Parish for House Speaker.Ron Gomez, p. 185 In Louisiana, unlike most states, the governor personally selects the legislative leadership. Therefore, Nelson's \\"candidacy\\" for Senate president had always been dependent on gubernatorial preference.Ron Gomez, p. 185 In 1992, Nunez returned as Senate president, as Nelson left office. Nelson was unopposed in the 1987 nonpartisan blanket primary, the last time his name appeared on the ballot. In 1990, Nelson opposed legislation authored by Senator Mike Cross to ban abortion in cases of rape and incest and impose fines of up to $100,000 and ten years imprisonment on the practitioners thereof. Governor Roemer declared the legislation incompatible with the United States Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade. His vetoRoemer vetoes abortion bill\\", Minden Press-Herald, July 27, 1990, p. 1 alienated large numbers of his socially conservative electoral base. The legislature subsequently overrode Roemer's veto with an even larger margin than in the original bill ‚Äì another slap at Roemer. State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge, one of the leading abortion foes in the legislature, said the prohibition regarding rape and incest is needed to prevent women from filing false claims in such matters. Nelson, however, said that he opposed the abortion ban because of the problems of unwanted children and defective births.\\"Abortion: Roemer vows veto, Jenkins, an override\\", Minden Press-Herald, June 28, 1990, p. 3 In 1991, United States District Judge Adrian G. Duplantier of New Orleans, a former state senator, ruled that the measure was in conflict with Roe v. Wade. Nelson did not seek a fourth term in the primary election held on October 19, 1991. Instead, the Democrat Gregory J. Barro of Shreveport led the field with 11,224 votes (34 percent). Republican Ronald Bradford \\"Ron\\" Fayard (October 1, 1946 ‚Äì March 7, 2011), a Realtor, Mississippi native, and civic leader from Bossier City, trailed with 10,228 votes (31 percent). The Democrat and later a Republican judge, Parker Self (born 1959) of Bossier City received 29 percent of the vote; a second Republican candidate, Shreveport attorney Leroy Havard Scott Jr. (1922-2003), held the remaining 5.5 percent of the ballots cast. In the general election, Barro defeated Fayard, 22,616 (58.9 percent) to 15,803 (41.1 percent). Nelson today Nelson and his wife, the former Gail Anderson (born March 1936), have a son, Sydney S.

The station was designed in Swiss chalet style by Balthazar Lange and was wedged between the town and the Oslofjord. It was located from Oslo. When the Vestfold Line was being planned, some plans called for it to run via Horten. Instead, a more inland route was chosen and a branch line was built to the town. Traffic peaked in the 1920s, when ca. 200,000 people traveled on the line, and the station saw a peak thirteen daily services during the 1940. The line past the station was converted to standard gauge in 1949 and electrified in 1957. By then the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) had started to run a bus service to Skoppum Station and gradually reduced service to Horten. From 1967 all passenger traffic was terminated. The station building has since burned down. History There were a large number of proposals for which route the Vestfold Line should follow, while it was being planned during the late 1860s and early 1870s. The main two proposals were an interior route and a coastal route. The latter had three sub-proposals, two of which ran west of Horten and one which ran through the town. Horten was regarded as a sufficiently important settlement that all alternatives which did not run through it called for a branch line to reach Horten. Part of the reason for the towns importance was that it hosted Karljohansvern, the main base of the Royal Norwegian Navy.Jakobsen (1996): 13 Horten station and downtown 1964-09-30 The route issue was not settled until Parliament chose the \\"compromise coastal alternative\\" on 8 June 1875, in which the Vestfold Line bypassed Horten, but a branch was to be built from Skoppum.Jakobsen (1996): 16 The station was officially opened on 13 October 1881, although regular traffic did not start until 7 December.Bjerke (1994): 171 The line was originally built with narrow gauge () and the line and station were converted to standard gauge on 3 October 1949,Jakobsen (1996): 96 as the last section to be converted in Norway.Jakobsen (1996): 133 The line was electrified on 11 December 1957.Jakobsen (1996): 140 NSB decided that it was cheaper to operate all services by bus, and closed down all passenger services on the Horten Line from 26 May 1967. A modest amount of freight traffic was retained.Jakobsen (1996): 130 Service Initially the line had four trains per direction per day, increasing to seven in 1884. It reached eleven during the 1920s and peaked with thirteen from 1946.Aspenberg (1994): 140 Travel time was initially 16 minutes between Skoppum and Horten.Jakobsen (1996): 125 The line's patronage peaked in the 1920, when ca. 200,000 annual passengers were transported along with between 5,000 and 15,000 tonnes of cargo.Aspenberg (1994): 143 Though their bus division, NSB Biltrafikk, the railway company operated both bus and train services between Skoppum and Horten from the mid-1940s.Aspenberg (1994): 142 With the gauge conversion in 1949, the number of daily services to eight. NSB gradually increased its focus on bus traffic on the route, reducing the number of train services to five from 1962. Facilities The station building was designed by Balthazar Lange, who had the responsibility for designing all the stations along the Vestfold and Horten Line. Designed in Swiss chalet style, Horten was among the larger station in Vestfold, as it among other duties had to act as a port of entry.Hartmann (1997): 147 It is physically placed between the town and the fjord, originally on a parcel of land so small that it could only house two through tracks and two spurs. As time went the fjord was gradually filled, allowing the station room to expand. In the first decades up to twenty people worked at the station.Jakobsen (1996): 128 Horten Station was located from Skoppum Station on the Vestfold Line, and from Oslo West Station. It was located at an elevation of above mean sea level. In addition to the station area, it had a short branch to the port. Horten Station has burned down.

Blodgett Estate, also known as Brookby, is an historic landmark at 250 Plymouth Rd, SE, East Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1977. The property is owned by Aquinas College. History Delos A. Blodgett moved to Michigan in 1848 and became rich in the lumbering business. He came to Grand Rapids in 1881. By that time, his son, John W. Blodgett (born in 1860) had taken over part of the business. John W. Blodgett served as president of the Muskegon Boom Company from 1883 to 1893, and following his father's retirement in 1900, he took over as chairman of the Blodgett Company. In 1895, John W. Blodgett married Minnie Cumnock of Lowell, Massachusetts. Minnie Cumnock Blodgett took a deep interest in community affairs, and was nationally known for her work in public health and welfare. In 1928, the Blodgetts constructed a new estate located on Fisk Lake. The estate consists of the Blodgett house as well as several other subsidiary buildings. The main house was designed by the A. Stewart Walker, a member of the architectural firm of Walker and Gillette. The surrounding grounds were designed by the Olmsted Brothers. John and Minnie Blodgett lived at the estate until their deaths, hers in 1931 and his in 1951. John W. Blodgett willed the estate to Blodgett Hospital, but hist son, John Jr., repurchased it the next year, and lived there until his death in 1986. The Blodgett estate stayed in the Blodgett family after John and Minnie's death, until Edith Blodgett sold it in the early 1990s. Sam and Janene Cummings purchased the estate in 1997, and in 2011 donated it to Aquinas College. Aquinas began restoration of the estate in 2016. Description The John W. Blodgett Estate is an eight-acre parcel containing the Blodgett house and other, subsidiary buildings. The grounds are beautifully landscaped, and include formal gardens, terraces, and large, old trees. The house is a broad-fronted two-story red brick structure with Georgian Revival detailing. The main facade contains a central portion which projects forward from the main mass of the building. This section is divided into three bays by four pilasters. A dentiled brick cornice runs across the pilaster tops. The central bay contains the entrance, consisting of the two slender doors topped by a transom and flanked by Corinthian pilasters. A row of Corinthian columns supporting a pediment fronts the entrance. The first-floor windows throughout the house are set in semi-circular arched openings, and have semi-circular fanlight windows and side lights. The second- floor openings are rectangular, and most contain double-hung, six-over-six windows.

It was discovered on 27 October 1989, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at the Palomar Observatory in California. The presumed E-type asteroid is likely spherical in shape and has a short rotation period of 2.99 hours. It was named for American amateur astronomer Robert Holmes. The discovery of its 1-kilometer-sized minor-planet moon was announced in November 2005.  Orbit and classification  Holmes is a core member of the Hungaria family (), a large family of bright asteroids that forms the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System, as the Mars-crosser and near-Earth populations are much more sparse. The family is part of the larger dynamical group with the same name. It orbits the Sun in the innermost asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8‚Äì2.1 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (970 days; semi-major axis of 1.92 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 23¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar in October 1989.  Physical characteristics  Holmes is an assumed E-type asteroid, which agrees with the overall spectral type for members of the Hungaria family. = Rotation period = Since 2005, several rotational lightcurves of Holmes have been obtained from photometric observations by Brian Warner and Petr Pravec in collaboration with other astronomers. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve gave a well- defined rotation period of 2.9940 hours with a consolidated brightness amplitude between 0.10 and 0.12 magnitude, which indicates that the body has a nearly spherical shape (). The asteroid's short period is near that of a fast rotator. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Holmes measures 3.147 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.31, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts Petr Pravec's revised WISE-data, that is, an albedo of 0.2849 and a diameter of 3.21 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.445. Johnston's Archive derives a diameter of 2.95 and 3.15 kilometers for the primary only and for the combined system, respectively. = Satellite = The photometric observations obtained by Brian Warner and collaborators during 2‚Äì12 November 2005, revealed that Holmes is a synchronous binary asteroid with a minor- planet moon orbiting it every 24.4 hours at an estimated average distance of . The discovery was announced immediately on 15 November 2005. The mutual occultation events indicated the presence of a satellite 37% the size of its primary, which translates into an estimated diameter of kilometers depending on the underlying size estimate of the primary.  Naming  This minor planet was named after American amateur astronomer Robert E. Holmes Jr (born 1956), who directs the Astronomical Research Observatory in Westfield, Illinois.

The mission's first church was organized in 1954. The next year a school began. By 1957, a boarding high school was established. The Fetu Ao traveled among the islands and brought students to the school. It did this up to the early 1970s. Geography The islands of the Gilbert chain consist of coral rather than soil. The highest point on most of these islands is less than above sea level. Agriculture is quite limited. The main crop is coconuts. Abemama is a small \\"C\\"-shaped island which encircles a lagoon.

The album was recorded between March and July 1979 in Germany at Rother's own studio in Forst and Conny's Studio. Receiving positive reviews the album was released as an LP in 1979 before it was re-released by Polydor in 1982. The album was issued on CD in 1990, and then reissued again in 1993 with bonus tracks and having been remastered. The artwork for the album was designed by Rike with photography by Ann Weitz and Rother himself. Recording and music Rother recorded Katzenmusik in conditions that were similar to his debut and second studio album, working again with Neu! and Harmonia producer Conny Plank and augmented with Jaki Liebezeit from Can on drums. Aside from Liebezeit, the entirety of the album was written and performed by Rother utilising guitar and electronic instrumentation. Rother reduced the palette of instrumentation and wrote the album essentially as a suite in two parts. Instead of clearly differentiated tracks the twelve pieces are variations layered around four different five-note melodies that recur either as single string statements triple-track or stark chords supporting them. The album was the final collaboration between Rother and the producer Conny Plank. Plank had produced all of Rother's albums including his work with Neu! and Harmonia with the exception of Harmonia's debut 1974's Musik Von Harmonia. Rother is credited as the sole producer on his subsequent studio albums. Releases Katzenmusik was first released on Sky Records as an LP in 1979. The album has been re-released several times, again as an LP on Polydor after Rother joined the label in 1982. In 1993, Rother secured the rights to his back catalogue and re-issued all of his solo albums with bonus tracks and remastered sound on his own label, Random Records. In 2000, Rother re-issued all of the albums again in partnership between Random Records and BSC Music.

He was selected by his teammates as captain of the 1907 team. His final game for Holy Cross was a 34‚Äì0 loss to Fordham. Despite the one-sided game, The New York Times singled out \\"O'Donnell's Pretty Play\\" as the feature of the contest. The Times wrote: > Again and again by the sheer force of his phenomenal running O'Donnell took > the ball through the Fordham line and gained a dozen first downs. In fact, > not once during the whole progress of the game was the remarkable back > stopped for a loss, but, unsupported as he was, the herculean task of > beating a well-drilled eleven was too much for him. ...

In the national championship of high school football, Everett, the best team in the East, was matched against Oak Park High School from Illinois, the best team in the West. Everett defeated Oak Park 80 to 0. The Boston Evening Transcript wrote at the time, \\"Since Cleo O'Donnell took charge of the Suburban League school's athletics, he has had remarkable success, but this year's team is his masterpiece.\\" Seventy years later, Sports Illustrated published a feature story on the 1914 Everett team, declaring it possibly the greatest high school football team of all time. O'Donnell became known for the stylish suits he wore on the sidelines at Everett and developed a reputation as \\"a demanding perfectionist.\\" As the coach at Everett, O'Donnell compiled a record of 68‚Äì8‚Äì6, and through one stretch between 1913 and 1915 his team shut out all opponents in 25 consecutive games. In March 1916, O'Donnell was hired as the head football coach at Purdue University.

It was discovered on 4 July 1973, by American astronomer Eleanor Helin at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California. At the time of its discovery, it was the most highly inclined minor planet known to exist. It may be the parent body of the Quadrantids.  Parent of the Quadrantids  is a possible parent body of the Quadrantids, a major meteor shower that occurs every January. It may also be just a fragment of the parent or the dormant remains of the parent. Other possible parent bodies are and comet 96P/Machholz, as well as .  Orbit and classification  The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9‚Äì4.0 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,388 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.64 and an inclination of 68¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. No precoveries were taken. The asteroid's observation arc even begins 2 days after its discovery. The body was also one of the first known near-Earth asteroids. Its discovery happened just two days after it had passed from Earth on one of its closest approaches ever computed. It was then tracked for more than a month, but was not seen again until its next close approach in 1992, when it was recovered by the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia. Its minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth is now .  Physical characteristics  The stony S-type asteroid is also classified as a transitional C/X-type according to observations by the NASA IRTF telescope. A rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was obtained by American astronomer Brian Skiff from photometric observations made in June 2011. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.15 magnitude (). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 1.88 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 16.0.

Ngakala was elected to the PCT Central Committee at an extraordinary party congress held on 26-31 March 1979.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 262 . He was also appointed as Commander of the Congolese People's Militia.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 440 . Ngakala was considered part of the \\"Oyo clan\\", a group of political and military figures who were natives of Sassou Nguesso's home village, Oyo. Sassou Nguesso placed particular trust in members of the \\"Oyo clan\\", and they were given important positions in his regime.Patrice Yengo, La guerre civile du Congo-Brazzaville, 1993-2002: \\"chacun aura sa part\\" (2006), Karthala Editions, page 40 .

Together with Sassou Nguesso, he visited East Germany in May 1985. East Germany, as an ally of Congo-Brazzaville, provided the Congolese People's Militia with training and equipment.Gareth M. Winrow, The Foreign Policy of the GDR in Africa (1990), Cambridge University Press, page 141, note 99. Ngakala was also First Secretary of the Union of Congolese Socialist Youth (UJSC), the PCT's youth organization, for a time.\\"Michel Ngakala r√©int√®gre le PCT\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 20 December 2004 . In 1990, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. Events of the 1990s After Sassou Nguesso was defeated in the August 1992 presidential election, he and the PCT went into opposition. The controversial May-June 1993 parliamentary election was followed by an extended round of serious political violence between the government and opposition, and in that environment the various sides formed ethnically based militias to fight in Brazzaville.John F. Clark, \\"Congo: Transition and the Struggle to Consolidate\\", in Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), eds. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, Westview Press, pages 70-75.Florence Bernault, \\"The Political Shaping of Sacred Locality in Brazzaville 1959-97\\", in Africa's Urban Past (2000), eds. David M.

Amphas, Political Transformations of the Congo (2000), Pentland Press, page 102.Fran√ßois-Xavier Verschave, Noir silence: qui arr√™tera la Fran√ßafrique? (2000), Les Ar√®nes, page 53 . The Cobras were concentrated in the Mpila, Ouenz√©, and Talanga√Ø districts of Brazzaville, and they were allied with the Ninja militia loyal to another opposition leader, Bernard Kol√©las, which was concentrated in the Bacongo district. The army and the Zoulou militia loyal to President Pascal Lissouba attacked their opponents on 3 November 1993, but were unsuccessful; the competing militias continued to violently dominate the city. An agreement in January 1994 facilitated a gradual return to peace. On 5 June 1997, a civil war broke out between the government of President Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso's Cobra militia. After months of fighting, the Cobras, assisted by Angolan troops, captured Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire on 14-15 October 1997, thereby ousting Lissouba and returning Sassou Nguesso to power.Howard W. French, \\"Rebels, Backed by Angola, Take Brazzaville and Oil Port\\", The New York Times, 16 October 1997.R√©my Bazenguissa-Ganga, \\"The Spread of Political Violence in Congo-Brazzaville\\", in African Affairs, vol. 98, no. 390, January 1999, pages 389-411. High Commissioner for Reintegration After a 2001 national peace convention,\\"Delegates at Republic of Congo talks sign peace convention\\", Associated Press, 15 April 2001. the office of High Commissioner for the Reintegration of Former Combatants was established through a presidential decree on 10 August 2001, and Ngakala was appointed to the post. His task was to oversee the process of disarming rebels and reintegrating them into civilian life.\\"Le Haut commissariat √† la r√©insertion dresse le bilan de ses activit√©s\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 26 February 2001 . As High Commissioner for the Reintegration of Former Combatants, Ngakala continued to be closely associated with Pierre Oba, who served in the government as Minister of the Interior. Ngakala's work was focused on the reintegration of rebel fighters from the Pool-based Ninja militia of Pasteur Ntoumi.\\"By other means\\", Africa Confidential, volume 43, number 12, 14 June 2002. He met with Ntoumi in the Vinza district on 16 October 2001, and both sides spoke warmly about peace and cooperation.\\"Le Haut-commissaire charg√© de la r√©insertion des ex-miliciens rencontre le pasteur Ntoumi\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 19 October 2001 . On 25 February 2002, Ngakala said that the disarmament and reintegration program was nearly ready to begin and that five regional offices across the country would be opened to facilitate its work. He also observed that the program had received about 3.4 billion CFA francs in funding from the International Development Association and that the International Organization for Migration (IOM) had already managed to collect about 1,200 weapons. However, the number of weapons collected by the IOM constituted only a small fraction of the total number of illegal weapons.\\"Revue de la presse congolaise - semaine du 25 F√©vrier\\", Congopage website, 2 March 2002 . The process proved to be difficult and spotty. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Ngakala sharply criticized Ntoumi on 21 March 2002, accusing him of failing to follow through on his commitments and thereby obstructing the peace process. He stressed that Ntoumi could not be allowed to continue controlling the Vinza district indefinitely, as the area was entitled to its parliamentary representation and local government, and he said that Ntoumi should not interpret the government's attempts at peaceful resolution as a sign of weakness.\\"Les autorit√©s congolaises souhaitent r√©gler au plus vite le cas ¬´ Ntoumi ¬ª\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 March 2002 . Ngakala's \\"inflammatory\\" remarks were followed by a round of renewed fighting between the army and the Ninjas. Shooting subsequently broke out at an April 2002 meeting between Ngakala and about 700 Ninjas in Brazzaville, causing around 80,000 people to flee. Ngakala retired from the military in 2002. The pace of disarmament and reintegration remained slow in subsequent years. Speaking on 4 June 2004, Ngakala again blamed Ntoumi for delaying the process through his failure to follow through on his commitments.\\"Michel Ngakala : ¬´ Les accords de paix souffrent de la versatilit√© du pasteur Ntoumi ¬ª\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 5 June 2004 . On 18 December 2004, Ngakala announced that he had rejoined the PCT. In the wake of disappointing results and international disapproval for the reintegration program, Ngalaka presented a revamped program on 9 February 2005. The new program was broader in scope and placed a higher priority on disarmament, which was to be funded by the European Union.\\"Le gouvernement pr√©sente son nouveau programme de d√©sarmement et r√©insertion des ex-combattants\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 10 February 2005 . Ngakala was included on the Directory of the Preparatory Committee for the PCT's Fifth Extraordinary Congress; although not a member of the PCT Political Bureau, he was specially added to the Directory on 31 October 2006, along with a number of others.\\"PCT : le bureau politique r√©unifi√© annonce le congr√®s d'ici le 15 novembre\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 November 2006 .\\"La feuille de route du PCT en vue de la tenue du 5e congr√®s extraordinaire du parti\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 3 November 2006 . The congress was held on 22-29 December 2006.\\"La direction du Parti Congolais du Travail s'ouvre aux jeunes et aux femmes\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 30 December 2006 . On 17-18 January 2007, Ngakala--acting as the representative of the PCT--met with Fran√ßois Ibovi, the Minister of Territorial Administration, to discuss preparations for the 2007 parliamentary election, along with representatives from various other parties.Gankama N'Siah, \\"Le ministre de l'Administration du territoire rencontre les responsables des partis politiques\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 19 January 2007 . Ngakala played an important role in the PCT's activities during the election period due to his role as the PCT's Permanent Secretary in charge of Organization and Party Life.Thierry Noungou, \\"Michel Ngakala : ¬´ Nous devons respecter l'esprit de nos accords politiques ¬ª\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 5 July 2007 . The results of the first round of the parliamentary election, held in June 2007, showed the PCT winning half of the seats that were decided in the first round, while PCT allies won many of the other seats. Regarding electoral strategy for the second round, Ngakala said on 4 July 2007 that the PCT was focused on \\"consultation and consensus\\" with its allies. While acknowledging that disagreement within the PCT and between the PCT and its allies was common, he said that the party \\"did not want to stifle enthusiasm\\". He also said that the election was a stepping stone towards improving the majority's ability to implement Sassou Nguesso's policies. Following the second round, Ngakala said on 11 August 2007 that the results were good because they gave Sassou Nguesso \\"a comfortable majority in the National Assembly\\". He also looked ahead to the 2009 presidential election, saying that a reorganization of the Presidential Majority was necessary to improve its position for that election. Some PCT candidates argued that they failed to win seats due to their opposition to the \\"refoundation\\" of the PCT (a project that was favored by the PCT's top leadership), but Ngakala retorted that no action had been taken to eliminate their candidacies and that they had only lost because they failed to win enough votes. He noted that some opponents of the \\"refoundation\\" project had succeeded in winning seats.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Michel Ngakala tire les le√ßons des √©lections l√©gislatives pour le PCT\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 11 August 2007 . At a press conference on 20 September 2007, Ngakala said that Congo- Brazzaville was an example to the world because it had, in spite of the ruinous effects of the civil war, restored peace without international intervention.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le Parti congolais du travail pr√¥ne la politique de l'ouverture\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 20 September 2007 . He also argued that the PCT was firmly committed to dialogue and pluralism and that it had completely broken with the monolithic thinking that characterized single- party rule. According to Ngakala, the PCT's cooperative and pluralistic spirit was reflected in the party's willingness to accept a high level of internal debate as well as its openness to the opposition. He noted that a deputy from the opposition had been allowed to head one of the National Assembly's commissions.Pascal Azad Doko, \\"Michel Ngakala satisfait de l'ouverture faite √† l'opposition √† l'Assembl√©e nationale\\", La Semaine Africaine, N¬∞ 2729, 21 September 2007, page 3 . Ngakala was present for a World Bank meeting on the Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program that was held in Paris on 11-13 December 2007. On that occasion, he described Congo-Brazzaville's peace process as a unique achievement. According to Ngalaka, Congo-Brazzaville laid the foundations for peace through a national dialogue and the participation of exiled opposition leaders. He also said that Congo- Brazzaville was alone in managing its own disarmament and reintegration program, and he said that his country was willing to share its experience with other countries in the sub-region.No√´l Ndong, \\"A Paris, Michel Ngakala √©voque l'expertise congolaise pour le D√©sarmement, la d√©mobilisation et la r√©int√©gration\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 20 December 2007 . Ngakala continued to stress the importance of reorganizing the presidential majority and improving its cohesion in the wake of the 2007 parliamentary election. He said in December 2007 that the presidential majority would present joint lists for the 2008 local elections. Some parties in the presidential majority opposed this move, and Ngakala said that they were free to contest the elections on their own if they wished.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Elections locales : la plate-forme de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle opte pour les listes d'union\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 19 December 2007 . The Rally of the Presidential Majority (RMP), a large coalition of parties supporting Sassou Nguesso, was created on 20 December 2007.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le rassemblement de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle pose les bases de la cr√©ation d'un grand parti politique\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 December 2007 .Jo√´l Nsoni, \\"Le R.m.p et les enjeux fondamentaux de la politique au Congo\\" , La Semaine Africaine, N¬∞ 2755, 28 December 2007, page 3 . Ngakala, who was credited with playing a key role in the establishment of the RMP, was designated as the First Vice-President of the RMP's National Coordination.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le Rassemblement de la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle installe les coordinations d√©partementales et locales\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 2 February 2008 . After the opposition Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD) extended an offer of dialogue to the PCT on 21 December 2008, Ngakala welcomed the move at a press conference on 9 January 2009. He spoke of the \\"ideological affinities\\" between the two parties, saying that \\"only ideas matter and enable men to transcend their egos\\". He also took the opportunity to criticize the proliferation of political parties, most of which were ethnically or tribally based, and said that Congolese politics would be more productive if there were only three large parties with specific programs.Roger Ngomb√©, \\"Le Parti congolais du travail se f√©licite de son rapprochement avec le Rassemblement pour la d√©mocratie et le d√©veloppement\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 9 January 2009 . Ngakala headed a PCT delegation that met with a delegation from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on 11 June 2010 in Brazzaville. The meeting was intended to strengthen the already warm relationship between the two parties and their respective countries.Willy Mbossa, \\"Le Parti congolais du travail renforce ses liens avec le Parti communiste chinois\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 12 June 2010 . At the PCT's Sixth Extraordinary Congress, held in July 2011, Ngakala was elected to the party's 51-member Political Bureau.Jo√´l Nsoni, \\"Denis Sassou Nguesso aux congressistes du P.c.t : ¬´Les √©lections ne se gagnent pas dans les bureaux. Elles se gagnent sur le terrain¬ª\\" , La Semaine Africaine, 30 July 2011 . He was also re-elected to his post as Secretary for Organization, in charge of Party Life.\\"Membres de Comit√© central du PCT √©lus par le VIe congr√©s\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville N¬∞1294, 29 July 2011, page 5 . The party leadership was substantially altered at the July 2011 congress; only two previous members of the Permanent Secretariat, including Ngakala, were retained amongst the 12 members of the Secretariat elected at the Sixth Extraordinary Congress. After 11 years as High Commissioner for the Reintegration of Former Combatants, Ngakala was succeeded by Norbert Dabira at a ceremony on 14 November 2012. Ngakala explained on the occasion that at the PCT's 2011 congress it had been decided that state positions were incompatible with positions on the PCT Secretariat and therefore he must devote himself exclusively to his party work. Pascal Biozi Kiminou, \\"Haut-commissariat √† la r√©insertion des ex- combattants : Michel Ngakala a pass√© le t√©moin √† Norbert Dabira\\", La Semaine Africaine, 16 November 2012 .

At 6-foot-4, 280 pounds, he ran the dash in 4.76 seconds, and was known for having a quick burst off the line. Lorig did not work out while at the combine due to injury. In his first two years at Stanford, Lorig played tight end and wore number 80. In his freshman campaign, Lorig played in all 12 games where he contributed on special teams and served as the offense's blocking TE, often lining up in the backfield as an H-back/fullback. He recorded 10 catches for 100 yards. He was then asked by the new coaching staff to switch to defensive end for his junior year, and proceeded to record 39 tackles, including 6 tackles for loss and 3 sacks in 2008, and had 37 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and 2 sacks in 2007. His NFL prospect status took a severe hit in 2009, when he sat out most of the season because of a torn pectoral muscle. In his five years at Stanford he started 25 of 29 games, and had 95 tackles, 16.5 tackles for a loss, and 4.5 sacks, earning Honorable Mention All-Pac 10 as a junior, and All-Pac All-Academic team twice (2008, 2009).

The group, with four core members, breaks traditional theatrical bounds to create its own brand of theater. Founded in New York in 1995, the members of Universes came together in the urban poetry scene of the late 1990s. Through sessions at the New York Theatre Workshop they have developed from a revue format to mounting fully fledged theater pieces. They have performed at venues throughout the United States and toured extensively world-wide. History In early 1995, while collaborating at The POINT CDC and frequenting the NuYorican Poets Cafe, a group of poets decided to perform together, something which had happened before on separate occasions but with different players. This night it would be Steven Sapp, Flaco Navaja, Caridad de la Luz and Hector Luis Rivera (Mildred was present but performed a song separately that night). In planning for this performance, the group decided that they should give themselves a name. They went through several ideas for several hours and at the end of the night gave up and decided to use the last name given by Hector Luis Rivera, \\"UNIVERSES from the BronxSide\\". The poets each read poems in tandem but managed to link them in subject matter. After that \\"one night only\\" performance, Hector continued his work with The Welfare Poets and the rest of the group, including Mildred, decided to evolve the company incorporating music and theater. Paul Jonathan Thompson (Trumpet) joined the company soon after as did Angel Rodriguez (Percussion). The company was featured at WORD LIFE (Irvin Plaza) on February 8, 1997. Introduced by Felipe Luciano (formerly of the Young Lords Party) the company opened the show. After this, some of company members then traveled to Poland within a larger group of actors from THE POINT's Live from The Edge Theater under the leadership of Steven and Mildred to collaborate in a production of Alfred Jarry's UBU under the direction of Steven Sapp in collaboration with Teatre Ploski. Caridad de la Luz began to pursue her solo career soon thereafter. On March 22, 1997 Universes from the Bronxside was invited to perform at a fundraiser event at El Puente (Brooklyn, NY) called Lemon+Aid to help Lemon Andersen, who was then imprisoned, after his release. Steven, Mildred, Flaco & Caridad and Paul performed that night. Once Lemon was released and saw the fundraiser video tape, he visited UNIVERSES at The Point to meet them. Soon thereafter, Lemon joined the company and after seeing some of the theatrical performances Steven and Mildred had created at Bard College in 1989 (namely, \\"Purgatory\\") he was on board with the idea that the company should shift into a more theatrical ensemble. Universes was creating 10‚Äì15 minute vignettes which incorporated Poetry, Music, Theater and movement. As the company grew in name recognition, Lemon, who was from brooklyn, asked if the company could drop \\"from the Bronxside\\", The company agreed, in an effort to be more inclusive and more \\"universal\\". After that, UNIVERSES invited Gamal Abdel Chasten to join the company. Gamal was also a poet in the NYC scene and complimented UNIVERSES storytelling and musical styles. Lois Griffith of The NuYorican Poets Cafe invited UNIVERSES for a dull evening of work. Before then, Universes would only perform 10‚Äì15 vignettes at venues. This would be the first of UNIVERSES' full-length works. It had no title, and included some of the companies already polished pieces and some new works. Universes then decided that they would work on their 1st play ... \\"The Ride\\". Universes members all grew up in housing projects in New York City and starting performing poetry in the \\"thriving spoken-word scene\\" of the late 1990s, namely, The NuYorican Poets Cafe. Based out of The Bronx, NY, the company was born and raised of the artistic environment created by Steven Sapp and Mildred Ruiz, also co-founders of THE POINT Community Development Corporation (Hunts Point) in 1993. The Company was founded by Steven Sapp and Mildred Ruiz-Sapp and currently consists of four core members: Steven Sapp, Mildred Ruiz-Sapp, Gamal Abdel Chasten and William Ruiz (a.k.a. Ninja). The company's work transitioned from a revue format to fully fledged theatrical pieces under the direction of Jo Bonney at the New York Theatre Workshop, where they presented their first major show, Slanguage in 2001. Originally written and performed by UNIVERSES (Steven, Mildred, Gamal, Flaco Navaja and Lemon Andersen, Slanguage evolved from a work entitled U, first presented at Performance Space 122 in 1999, and then was developed via workshops and performances at the Mark Taper Forum, Los Angeles, and New World Theatre at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This was followed by Rhythmicity: Flipping the Script, created in collaboration with UNIVERSES (Steven, Mildred, Gamal), Reg.e.gaines, Rha Goddess, Willie Perdomo and Regie Cabico, featured at the Actors Theater of Louisville‚Äôs Humana Festival of New American Plays in 2003; Steven Sapp and Mildred Ruiz-Sapp‚Äôs \\"Eyewitness Blues\\" directed by Talvin Wilks at New York Theatre Workshop (later redeveloped as \\"Blue Suite\\" under the direction of Chay Yew for Gala Hispanic Theater and The Goodman Theatre; and Gamal Chasten‚Äôs The Last Word, premi√®red at Performance Space 122. In 2008, Universes toured to Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, Romania, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom as part of the United States Department of State's ‚ÄúRhythm Road: American Music Abroad‚Äù program through Jazz at Lincoln Center, performing a variety of pieces including New Orleans, Mahalia, Freedom Suite, Don't Front and Junior Calling. UNIVERSES premi√®red Ameriville (Created by: Steven, Mildred, Gamal and Ninja (William Ruiz)), a work examining the United States through the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at the Actors Theater of Louisville‚Äôs Humana Festival of New American Plays in 2009 and toured with it throughout America. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival commissioned the company to produce new works for their \\"American Revolutions: U.S. History Cycle\\" project. Party People premiered at the festival in 2012. UniSon, inspired by and using excerpts of August Wilson's unpublished poetry, premiered in 2017. In 2019 Universes' anthology, entitled The Big Bang: Plays, Poetry and Process will be published by Theatre Communications Group (TCG Books). Members Mildred Ruiz-Sapp, married to fellow member Steven Sapp, is also elder sister to William \\"Ninja\\" Ruiz. The three, plus Gamal Abdel Chasten, make up the current core four of the group. However, as described by Ruiz-Sapp, the nature of UNIVERSES allows members to come and go as works with their schedules. Past collaborating members of UNIVERSES include (in order of appearance): Flaco Navaja, Caridad de la Luz, Paul J. Thompson, Angel Rodriguez, Lemon Andersen, Carlos Pimentel, Antoine Drey, Maurice Turner. Reception The group has been generally well received by critics in the United States and further afield, although with some reservations. The Boston Herald, said of Slanguage that it \\"crackles with passion and street-smart humor. It's a linguistic fireworks display, and it's difficult not to be swept along with its percussive momentum and dazzling wordplay.\\" The New York Times said, \\"Here, out of the mouths and clapping hands and dancing feet of five multitalented performers known collectively as Universes, comes the poetry of the city, minted in the urban furnace where the flint of real life strikes the sparks of creation from concrete pavement and steel tracks.\\" The New Orleans Times- Picayune said of Ameriville, \\"In urban planning terms, \\"Ameriville\\" is a high- density block. Under the direction of Chay Yew, a torrent of characters, words, movement and song issued from William \\"Ninja\\" Ruiz, Gamal Chasten, Steven Sapp and Mildred \\"Mils\\" Ruiz-Sapp. Their execution dazzled on multiple levels for 90 nonstop minutes. But the emotional payout was inconsistent, especially after the setting shifted from New Orleans.\\" The Denver Post suggested that most \\"effective are the scenes that are more personal than didactic, honest, first-person stories that address the underlying issues in a more tangential way: a man wonders who will carry on the traditions of the Carnival krewes, who will be the \\"Little Chiefs\\" if everyone goes away. A man in a barber shop reminisces about his mother's anger over a bad haircut. A Mardi Gras partyer sits on a curb trying to hold down the numerous hurricane cocktails he's consumed. It is these small, genuine moments from everyone's lives that paint the picture best.\\" Works *UniSon *Party People *Spring Training (Igor Stravinsky) *Ameriville *Blue Suite *Rhythmicity: Flipping The Script *The Denver Project *The Last Word *One Shot In Lotus Position *Eyewitness Blues (Which later became BLUE SUITE) *Slanguage *Live From The Edge *The Ride References External links *Official website *Official Facebook page Category:1996 establishments in New York (state) Category:Organizations established in 1996 Category:Theatre companies in New York City ","title":"Universes (theatre ensemble)"},{"id":"27094270","text":"Benjamin Becker was the defending champion, however he chose to compete in Rome instead.
