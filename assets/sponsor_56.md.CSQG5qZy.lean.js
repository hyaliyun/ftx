In February 1970 he became commander of the Twenty-Second Air Force (Military Airlift Command) at Travis Air Force Base, California. There he had prime responsibility for the extensive strategic airlift flown from the continental United States to Southeast Asia. During this time, he also flew more than 900 hours in the C-141 Starlifter. While he was Twenty-Second Air Force commander, the world's largest aircraft, the C-5 Galaxy, entered the Military Airlift Command inventory and a C-5 squadron was activated at Travis. In September 1972 Moore assumed command of the Thirteenth Air Force at Clark Air Base in the Philippines, known as the Jungle Air Force. He was responsible for United States Air Force units in Taiwan, Thailand and the Republic of the Philippines. C-130 Herculeses under his command were the first aircraft into Hanoi to prepare for returning prisoners of war, and he commanded the homecoming operation at Clark Air Base under the direction of the commander in chief, Pacific Command. General Moore was assigned as chief of staff, Pacific Command, in October 1973. He participated in the planning and execution of numerous missions: complex airlift efforts for resupply of Cambodia; evacuation of Phnom Penh (Operation Eagle Pull) and Saigon (Operation Frequent Wind); Operation Babylift; Operation New Life; and the Mayaguez operation. =Later career= He became assistant Vice Chief of Staff United States Air Force, with the additional duty of senior Air Force member, Military Staff Committee, United Nations, in October 1976.

The law is part of the reauthorization of funding for child nutrition (see the original Child Nutrition Act). It funded child nutrition programs and free lunch programs in schools for 5 years.Child Nutrition Fact Sheet, whitehouse.gov In addition, the law set new nutrition standards for schools, and allocated $4.5 billion for their implementation. The new nutrition standards were a centerpiece of First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative to combat childhood obesity. In FY 2011, federal spending totaled $10.1 billion for the National School Lunch Program. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act allows USDA, for the first time in 30 years, opportunity to make real reforms to the school lunch and breakfast programs by improving the critical nutrition and hunger safety net for millions of children. Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act and Michelle Obama were a step in transforming the food pyramid recommendation, which has been around since the early 1990s, into what is now known as \\"MyPlate\\". According to the US Department of Agriculture, for the 2012-13 school year, 21.5 million American children received free lunch or reduced-price lunch at school. Across the U.S, the school lunch program varies by state. In December 2018, the USDA weakened the ability to enforce the Act.  Legislative history  The bill was introduced in the US Senate by Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. It was later approved by the Senate by unanimous voice vote on August 5, 2010. In the U.S. House of Representatives The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act passed with 247 Democrats and 17 Republicans voting for, and 4 Democrats and 153 Republicans voting against it. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on December 13, 2010. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act took effect in 2014. Senators Charles Schumer, (D-NY) and Kirsten Gillibrand, (D-NY) pushed for Greek yogurt, much of which is manufactured in Utica, NY, to be included in the regulations determining acceptable proteins to be served at school.  Provisions  The Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to make significant changes to the school lunch program for the first time in over 30 years. In addition to funding standard child nutrition and school lunch programs, there are several new nutritional standards in the bill. The main aspects are listed below. New Food Standards * Gives USDA the authority to set new standards for food sold in lunches during the regular day, including vending machines. * Authorizes additional funds for the new standards for federally-subsidized school lunches. * Provides resources for schools and communities to utilize local farms and gardens to provide fresh produce. * Provides resources to increase nutritional quality of food provided by USDA * Sets minimum standards for school wellness policies * Limits milk served to nonfat flavored milk or 1 percent white milk *Reduced portion sizes in meals *Mandate a minimum on fruit, vegetables, and whole grain servings *Mandate a maximum sodium, sugar, and fat content = Increases access = * Increased the number of eligible children for school meal programs by 115,000 * Uses census data to determine student need in high-poverty areas, rather than relying on paper applications. * Authorizes USDA to provide meals in more after-school programs in \\"high-risk\\" areas * Increases access to drinking water in schools = Program monitoring = * Requires school districts to be audited every 3 years to see if they have met nutrition standards * Requires easier access for students and parents about nutritional facts of meals * Improves recall procedures for school food * Provides training for school lunch providers Criticism A YouTube video, produced by Wallace High School students in Kansas drew national attention and over 1.5 million views. The video complained of its students being \\"hungry\\" and not fed well enough to participate in their extracurricular activities or sports due to reduced portion sizes relative to those prior to the new law. In response to viewing the video, nutrition specialists explained that before the new standards were implemented, some schools may have been serving a lot of protein to keep their customers happy, \\"but none of us need as much protein as a lot of us eat\\". The experts also explained that eating 850 calories at lunch is enough for most high schoolers. Along with the viral video, other students are reaching out on other forms of social media by using the hashtag 'ThanksMichelleObama'. Sam Kass, the executive director of Let's Move! and senior policy adviser for Nutrition shared \\"We've seen the photos being tweeted, but we don't dictate the food that schools serve-school districts do.\\" A study done by Harvard School of Public Health discovered that about 60 percent of vegetables and roughly 40 percent of fresh fruit are thrown away due to no interest. Overall, the amount of food students did not eat but threw away instead increased by 56 percent.[NOTE] As of 2017, Harvard School of Public Health determined that food waste had not increased by a measurable percentage as a result of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. One of the biggest points of criticism for Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act is meal participation, and the participation has not increased, but decreased. The program has declined by nearly 4 percent and some schools have lost revenue due to the decline in participation, therefore, many are choosing to opt out of the program as a whole. In response to the criticism, the USDA issued modified standards which were intended to be more flexible.  Success  The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act provides meals to children that normally could not afford those nutritious food items. Research suggests that rural children are more likely to be overweight or obese when compared to urban children, the diets of rural children are less nutritious and their families have less access to healthy food, leading into the next reason of benefiting children facing obesity. It also allows schools to have more resources that they may not have had before. A study in Virginia and Massachusetts concluded that children in schools were eating significantly healthier meals when their parents or guardians were not choosing their food, but the school was. While looking at the nutrition value of 1.7 million meals selected by 7,200 students in three middle and three high schools in an urban school district in Washington state, where the data was collected and compared in the 16 months before the standards were carried out with data collected in the 15 months after implementation; the information found that there was an increase in six nutrients: fiber, iron, calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C, and protein. While providing new meals with improvements in fruits, vegetables, amount of variety, and portion sizes, the calorie intake has also transformed. The energy density ration was 1.65 before Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act compared to the new number of 1.44 after. Rollback On December 6, 2018, US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced a new rule which froze the Act's progressively lowering limits on sodium, while also allowing for the sale of 1% flavored milks and fewer whole grain-rich foods in school breakfast and school lunch options.

The company is a subsidiary of Japan's Sun Corporation. Overview Cellebrite is headquartered in Petah Tikva, Israel. Its two subsidiary companies, Cellebrite USA Corp. and Cellebrite GmbH are respectively based in Parsippany, New Jersey, US, and Munich, Germany. Cellebrite is a fully owned subsidiary of Sun Corporation, a publicly traded company listed on JASDAQ (6736/JQ) based in Nagoya, Japan. In 2017, Cellebrite's Mobile Lifecycle division was rebranded as Mobilogy. Mobilogy produces hardware and software for phone-to-phone data transfer, backup, mobile applications electronic software distribution, and data analysis tools. Mobilogy products are used by various mobile operators, and are deployed in wireless retail points of sale. Mobilogy works with handset manufacturers to ensure compatibility before devices are released to the public. Cellebrite's Mobile Forensics division was established in 2007 and produces software and hardware for mobile forensics purposes used by federal, state, and local law enforcement; intelligence agencies; military branches; corporate security and investigations; law firms; and private digital forensic examiners. History Cellebrite was established in Israel in 1999 by Avi Yablonka, Yaron Baratz, and Yuval Aflalo. Cellebrite's first manufactured hardware and software offered a compressive phone-to-phone data transfer devices and offered contact synchronization and content transfer tools for mobile phones, intended for use by wireless carrier sales and support staff in retail stores. Initially, Cellebrite's commercial products were used as a tool for migration from IS-95 (CDMA) enabled mobile phones to the GSM standard. Later, Cellebrite Wireless Carriers & Retailers' Universal Memory Exchanger (UME) gained additional data extraction and transfer capabilities, as well as additional mobile phone diagnostics, backup, and application management and delivery. In 2007, Cellebrite established an independent division targeted at the mobile forensics industry. Cellebrite's Mobile Forensics introduced mobile forensics products in 2007, under the family brand name 'Universal Forensic Extraction Device' (UFED), with the ability to extract both physical and logical data from mobile devices such as cellular phones and other hand-held mobile devices, including the ability to recover deleted data and decipher encrypted and password protected information. Also in 2007, Cellebrite was acquired by FutureDial Incorporated and one of its major shareholders, Sun Corporation in Japan. Today Sun Corporation is Cellebrite's largest shareholder. In 2019 Israeli Growth Partners (IGP) invested $110 million in Cellebrite. = Law enforcement assistance = In April 2011, the Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union questioned whether Michigan State Police (MSP) troopers were using Cellebrite UFEDs to conduct unlawful searches of citizens' cell phones. Following its refusal to grant the MCLU's 2008 Freedom of Information Act request unless the organization paid $544,000 to retrieve the reports, MSP issued a statement claiming that it honored the Fourth Amendment in searching mobile devices. In March 2016, it was reported that Cellebrite offered to unlock an iPhone involved in the FBI‚ÄìApple encryption dispute. Later, after the FBI announced it had successfully accessed the iPhone thanks to a third party, a press report claimed Cellebrite had assisted with unlocking the device, which an FBI source denied. A 2017 data dump suggests Cellebrite sold its data extraction products to Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Russia. On 16 September 2020, a report was released claiming that an Israeli firm provided Saudi Arabia with technological services to hack a mobile phone. The staff at Cellebrite demanded Saudis to send a government representative to meet one of their employees at the Riyadh airport. Following the demand, a representative of Cellebrite traveled to Riyadh in November 2019 for an hacking attempt into a phone in the possession of a Saudi Justice Ministry employee. The Cellebrite representative called for the authorities to let him pass through passport control without getting his passport stamped or his electronic equipment being checked, while remaining only under his possession. The hacker was supposed to head to an isolated hotel room from the airport, where the process was planned to be executed without any electronic surveillance. The Cellebrite representative then returned to the Riyadh airport to fly back to London.  Hong Kong  In August 2020, it was reported that Cellebrite sold its services to the Hong Kong Police Force for use in unlocking phones of detained demonstrators during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. As of October 7 2020, the company announced that it would stop selling its solutions and services to customers in Hong Kong and China as a result of a change in U.S. regulations. Products = Digital Intelligence products = Cellebrite offers a wide range of solutions as part of the company‚Äôs Digital Intelligence platform that assists in both criminal and enterprise investigations. The products fall into three categories: Access & Decode, Analyze & Review, and Manage & Control, and are designed to better equip investigators and accelerate the time to solve cases that involve digital evidence.

These include physical extraction and decoding of BlackBerry flash memory (going beyond mass storage or IPD backups), Android user/pattern lock bypass for physical extraction and decoding, physical extraction from phones with Chinese chipsets (including MediaTek and Spreadtrum), TomTom GPS trip-log decryption and decoding, iOS device unlocking, and other research and development.  Forensic data integrity  Cellebrite claims to maintain the integrity of digital evidence: * All cable connectors from subject (source) side act as a write blocker, being read-only via the onboard hardware chipset. * Although a Faraday shielded bag, included in all ruggedized UFED kits, blocks external electromagnetic fields and wireless radio signals, the UFED has a SIM card cloning capability which also isolates the phone from the wireless network. * Read-only boot loaders keep data from being altered or deleted during a physical extraction. Black Bag Technologies Acquisition In 2020, Cellebrite acquired BlackBag Technologies, an industry leader in computer forensic acquisition and analysis solutions. The acquisition allowed Cellebrite to expand its digital intelligence solution offerings to include data collection tools from computers in addition to sources such as mobile devices, cloud data, and call data records.  Data breach  On 12 January 2017, it was reported that an unknown hacker had acquired 900 GB worth of confidential data from Cellebrite's external servers. The data dump includes alleged usernames and passwords for logging into Cellebrite databases connected to the company's my.cellebrite domain, and also contains what appear to be evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices. The data suggests Cellebrite sold its data extraction products to countries such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Russia.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  In 2017, Cellebrite entered into a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 2.2 Million. On June 24th 2019, U.S. Cellebrite contracted with ICE for between $30 and $35 million. The 2019 contract is for ‚Äúuniversal forensic extraction devices (UFED)‚Äù and ‚Äúaccessories licenses, training and support services.‚Äù for one year, with an option to extend for up to five years.

According to the Canberra Times, in the early 90s directors with backgrounds in publishing and academia lost a factional battle to accountants who increased directors‚Äô salaries and gradually made it harder for members to participate in board elections.http://www.canberratimes.com.au/zoom/archive/rnews930119_0046_9809 In 2004, two disenchanted Sydney University Students launched a campaign to elect themselves onto the board to argue for cheaper textbooks and reduced directors‚Äô salaries. They claim the co-op responded by adding more obstacles to student participation, such as moving their AGMs to Hobart, increasing the number of members‚Äô signatures required to call SGMs from 200 to 10,000 and introducing requirements to be elected to the board that students cannot meet. Currently, to be elected to the board an individual must: 1) \\"demonstrate participation in the management and direction of a medium to large size business of not less than five years in aggregate\\" and 2) \\"have graduated from a recognized University...or TAFE degree‚Äù.

Kramer played for Hall of Fame coach Clair Bee from 1933‚Äì34 to 1936‚Äì37, and in his four seasons the team finished with records of 26‚Äì1, 24‚Äì2, 26‚Äì0, and 29‚Äì3, respectively. At one point Long Island had a 43-game win streak, which was snapped by Stanford and their star player Hank Luisetti. College Kramer, a , 200 lb. (91 kg) forward/guard, helped Long Island gain respect both in the New York City metropolitan area as well as in the national scene. Most schools during this era did not allow freshmen to play varsity sports in college‚Äîalthough there was no set rule against it‚Äîbut Clair Bee did, which allowed Kramer and LIU to remain dominant. In 1935‚Äì36, the Blackbirds finished undefeated at 26‚Äì0 and were named mythical \\"Eastern champions\\" since neither the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) nor the NCAA Tournament existed yet. The following season, Kramer's last in college, he was named the Haggerty Award winner which is given annually to the best men's basketball player in the New York City metropolitan area. At the time, it was the second year in the award's existence, and teammate Jules Bender had won it the year before. Professional After college, Kramer played in the first major professional basketball league, the American Basketball League. In 1938‚Äì39 he played for the Kingston Colonials, then spent the next three seasons with the Washington Heurich Brewers. Kramer was the league's fifth-leading scorer all three of those seasons while averaging 4.2 points per game. After his time with the Brewers, he played five more seasons of professional basketball. In 1945‚Äì46, his best season, he played for the Wilmington Bombers and appeared in 15 games. The Bombers finished third in the league with a 14‚Äì14 record but lost in the playoffs. Kramer's final season came in 1946‚Äì47 while playing for the Troy Celtics, although he appeared in only three games.

Subsequent plans to expand Lohberg were dropped. =Zeche Lohberg= In order to supply Dinslaken's ironworks with coke the industrialists Fritz Thyssen, Joseph Thyssen, August Thyssen as well as the assessor Arthur Jacob founded the mining corporation Lohberg on December 30, 1905. In 1907 sinking of the shafts Lohberg 1 and Lohberg 2 began at the country road between Dinslaken and H√ºnxe. During the course of time the coal mine expanded: new shafts were sunk, workers from Korea, Yugoslavia and Turkey were hired; and the capacity increased, until it reached its maximum in 1979 with 3,135,415 tons of coal. The mine was closed on January 1, 2006. The remaining 1,400 workers were hired by other coal mines or went into retirement. Demography As of December 31, 2009, Lohberg had 6,000 residents. Because of the high number of Gastarbeiter at the coal mine, approximately 40% of them have a Turkish background.

A Democrat, she was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 2010, representing the state's 19th district. She took office on January 12, 2011. Early life and career Raised in a military family, Cullison lived in four states and two European countries until she was 18. Her parents had maintained residency in Maryland, and she returned to the state to attend college. Cullison earned both bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park and began working for the St. Mary's County school district in 1978. Cullison moved from St. Mary's County to Montgomery County in 1981, where she worked as a special education teacher in the public schools. She worked as a special education teacher for 19 years. Twelve years of those years were spent teaching students with language disabilities at Kensington Parkwood Elementary. Cullison was elected to office in the Montgomery County Education Association, an 11,000-member teachers' union. In 2003, she was elected the union's president, a post she held for six years. While serving as president, Cullison advocated for affordable housing for teachers and advocated against laying off teachers to save money, In 2007, Cullison served as the chair of the Committee for Montgomery, a coalition of business and community leaders in Montgomery County, advocating for Montgomery County's interests in the Maryland General Assembly. Cullison retired from the Montgomery County Education Association in 2009 and now works for the National Education Association. In 2009, Cullison was the chief of the Montgomery County teachers' union. While seeking to be elected to the policy-setting executive committee of the National Education Association, Cullison raised money to pay for her campaign's travel, mailings, and other costs. She asked for contributions from Maryland state legislators, many of whom had previously been endorsed by the teachers' union. The Maryland State Attorney General's Office determined that political campaigns cannot fund a national union's internal election. The Maryland State Board of Elections ordered Cullison to refund the several thousand dollars she'd raised from state legislators, and she did so. Cullison was not elected to the position at the National Education Association. Political career =2010 election= Cullison mounted a bid for the Maryland House of Delegates in 2010, running in the three-member 19th district. The district includes the Montgomery County communities of Silver Spring, Wheaton, Leisure World, Northwood, Four Corners, Aspen Hill, Kemp Mill, Olney, Derwood, Laytonsville and unincorporated areas of Rockville and Gaithersburg. Incumbents Roger Manno and Henry B. Heller had decided against seeking reelection, creating two open seats in the 19th. Six Democrats filed to run in the primary election for delegate. The editorial board of The Washington Post endorsed her candidacy. In the Democratic primary election, Cullison placed second, winning one of the three Democratic nominations. The editorial board of The Washington Post endorsed her in the general election. She won the general election. =First term= During Cullison's first term in office, she advocated in favor of establishing same-sex marriage in Maryland. =2014 election= Cullison ran for reelection in 2014. She won the Democratic primary election as well as the general election. =Second term= Cullison supports public school buses providing transportation for students attending private schools, saying doing so helps parents and reduces traffic. Personal Cullison is openly gay; on June 23, 2013 she married her domestic partner of 30 years, Marcia Massey. She is one of eight openly LGBT members of the Maryland General Assembly, alongside Sen.

Encompassing all of Deering Street and much of State Street, as well as adjacent portions of Congress and Mellen Streets, it is a cohesive collection of high quality architect-designed buildings from the second half of the 19th century, that were originally predominantly residential in nature. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Deering Street is a short two-block street running parallel to Congress Street, the principal east-west street in downtown Portland. It is bisected by State Street, a major road which provides access to Congress Street from points to the north. At Deering Street's western end is Mellen Street. The historic district includes the entire length of Deering Street, all of State Street from Congress Street to Deering Oaks, and Mellen Street between Deering and Congress. It also extends a short way west of Mellen on the north side of Congress. The Thomas Brackett Reed House, a National Historic Landmark This area was mostly farmland until the mid-19th century, the city center to its southeast, and the port and major commercial area further east on the Falmouth peninsula. Development pressures prompted Nathaniel Deering, the landowner, to begin subdividing the area, and a few Greek Revival and Italianate homes were built in the area. Development pressure increased after Portland's great 1866 fire, after which other previously-residential areas were redeveloped commercially. With its proximity to the downtown, the Deering Street area became a fashionable residential address for merchants, businessmen, and politicians. Many houses were built on speculation, and most were designed by prominent local architects, including John Calvin Stevens, Francis H. Fassett, and George M. Harding, the latter of whom made his home on Deering Street. Notable houses in the Deering Street Historic District include 52 Deering Street (1884), an early example of Stevens' important Shingle style work, The William H. Roberts, Jr. House at 15 Mellen Street (1898), one of the few remaining single family John Calvin Stevens homes on the Portland peninsula that retains its original floor plan, and the National Historic Landmark Thomas Brackett Reed House, designed by Fassett in 1876.

Various publications name him as the first Jewish mayor of a major American city.  Biography  Bloom was born in Alsace, France in 1833, and left the country in 1850. He settled in Iowa City in 1857 and opened a clothing store, thus becoming the first Jewish settler and the first long-time clothier in the city. At the time, Iowa City was the capital of the recently established State of Iowa, and rapidly growing. With the major railhead soon arriving to the city, the travelers brought new business and Bloom's \\"One Price Clothing House\\" became very successful.Jewish Settlers in Iowa Bloom later opened two banks in the city. Bloom's first public office was a city alderman, for which he was elected in 1860, at the age of 27. He distinguished himself as a public speaker, and was noted for his address atop a box car to men departing for Union Army service in the Civil War. In 1873, Bloom was elected mayor of Iowa City.A Brief History Of Agudas Achim At the time, Iowa City had fewer than a dozen Jewish residents. He served as mayor for two years, until 1875.

They won the Essex Senior Cup in 1939/40 beating Leyton 2‚Äì0 at their Hare & Hounds Ground. After the War they entered the Spartan League with their reserves playing in Division 1 of the London League.

In June 1959, the fortunes of Ford Sports F.C. were fading and as Briggs Motor Bodies had been absorbed by the Ford Motor Company, a decision was made to amalgamate the two clubs with a new name of Ford United and so from season 1959‚Äì60 the name of Briggs Sports disappeared from the map. Ford United continued playing at Rush Green but with little success. Ford ultimately withdrew their sponsorship and refused to grant a five-year lease, which the Isthmian League required, and so the 2000‚Äì2001 season was their last at the ground. They moved to Barkingside and subsequently changed their name to Redbridge. Romford played six seasons at the ground but in 2008 the site was sold to West Ham United for use as a training ground. Grays Athletic played one season at the ground in 2012‚Äì13 when they finished Champions of The Isthmian League Division 1 North, but were refused permission to continue their stay as West Ham United had completed their alterations to the complex and it was required by the Academy.

Located at 184 Bonnechere Street, South Renfrew Collegiate Institute is one of two high schools in Renfrew. In 2015, Renfrew Collegiate Institute ranked 558 in Ontario Secondary Schools, according to Fraser Institute. Feeder schools include Queen Elizabeth Public School, Central Public School, and Admaston Township Public School.  History  In January, 1881, the first classes were held at the Renfrew High School. Mr. Charles McDowell was the first Principal. Enrolment grew rapidly and an enlarged building was opened on the same site in January 1896. In 1902, Renfrew High School applied for and received \\"Collegiate\\" status after having fulfilled numerous requirements. Renfrew High School thus became Renfrew Collegiate in 1902. A gym was added to Renfrew Collegiate in 1911. The original building that housed Renfrew Collegiate was eventually condemned due to sagging joists, inadequate ventilation and insufficient lighting. Students were housed in the Armouries for two years while the new school was being constructed. In 1923, a new, three story building was completed, consisting of 19 classrooms, a library, three science labs and an auditorium with a gymnasium underneath. In 1924, there were 390 students enrolled and 13 staff were employed at Renfrew Collegiate. The shop wing (formerly the gym which was constructed in 1911) was destroyed by fire in 1958. This wing was immediately replaced with a two-story wing containing five classrooms and a staff room. The \\"Baby Boom\\" and society's increased insistence that students remain in school until graduation resulted in a sharp increase in enrolment and therefore demand for educational facilities in the 1960s. A renovation in 1963, costing over $1,000,000, resulted in the creation of a new Technical Education wing and a new double gymnasium called the Grant Gymnasium, along with some modernization of the 1922 building. The old gym was also converted into a much needed cafeteria. In 1966 the school expanded yet again, adding 13 classrooms and a second gym called the MacNeil Gymnasium with a greenhouse on top. Stewart Field was also acquired in 1969, thanks in part to a bequest from the estate of Mrs. D. W. Stewart. The student population in 1970 was just under 1300 students. The staff totalled 81. In 1971, a new entrance and library was added to Renfrew Collegiate.  Extracurricular activities  As of 2018, Renfrew Collegiate Institute offers a wide variety of extracurricular activities. A part of the Upper Ottawa Valley High School Athletic Association, The Renfrew Collegiate Institute Raiders has teams competing in Alpine Skiing and Snowboarding, Badminton, Basketball, Cross Country, Football, Golf, Hockey, Nordic Skiing, Soccer, Tennis, Track and Field, Volleyball, and Wrestling. Renfrew Collegiate also offers a variety of clubs including: Art Club, Band, Computer, Chess, Drama, Free the Children, Interact, Outers, Yearbook, Pride, Dungeons and Dragons, Choir and Bluezone Student Council.  Departments  Renfrew Collegiate Institute offers courses in the Arts, Business, Canadian and World studies, Computer studies, English, French as a Second Language, Guidance and Career Education, Health and Physical Education, Interdisciplinary studies, Mathematics, Native studies, Science, Social Science and Humanities, and Technological education.  Transportation  Renfrew Collegiate Institute is partnered with Renfrew County Joint Transportation Consortium to provide a safe, cost effective and timely mode of transportation.  Renfrew Collegiate Intermediate School  Renfrew Collegiate underwent changes in 2010 to accommodate the inclusion of grades 7 and 8 due to overcrowding of the feeder schools. Renfrew Collegiate Intermediate School, or RCIS, is both a part of RCI and a separate school. It is an Intermediate school rather than a secondary school and has a different school schedule as well as stricter rules and policies for the students. RCIS has classrooms in one wing of both the first and second floors. The students use the same cafeteria and are allowed to participate in many of the RCI clubs. The students also take Tech classes in the high school Tech Wing. The MacNeil Gym is used mainly for RCIS's purposes. RCIS offers a 50% French Immersion Program. Subjects taught in French are: French Language, History, Geography, Health, Physical Education and some Visual Arts, Drama and Dance. Subjects taught in English are: English Language, Mathematics, Science, Exploring Technologies, Music and some Visual Arts, Drama and Dance. Most of the clubs and sports available for students at RCI are also available at the Intermediate level.

It was part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the UN after large numbers of United States Army (US) repelled a strong Korean People's Army (KPA) attack. During the nearby Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA broke through the US 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River. Exploiting this weakness, the KPA 9th and 4th Divisions attacked to Yongsan, a village east of the river and the gateway to the UN lines of supply and reinforcement for the Pusan Perimeter. What followed was a fight between KPA and US forces for Yongsan. The KPA were able to briefly capture Yongsan from the 2nd Infantry Division, which had been split in half from the penetrations at Naktong Bulge. Lieutenant General Walton Walker, seeing the danger of the attack, brought in the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to counterattack. In three days of fierce fighting, the Army and Marine forces were able to push the KPA out of the town and destroy the two attacking divisions. The win was a key step toward victory in the fight at the Naktong Bulge.  Background  = Pusan Perimeter = From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA tactics were to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used these tactics to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces. Map of the Pusan Perimeter Defensive line in September 1950 the Kyongju corridor is the northeasternmost sector. When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the KPA 7th Division, engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang- dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their tactics were not working. = September push = In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it; this was considered to be the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware of the UN forces building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that they must conduct an offensive soon or they could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five- prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the KPA 9th, 4th, 2nd and 10th Divisions to break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yongsan.  Battle  Troops of the US 9th Infantry await North Korean attacks across the Naktong River, September 3 On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the KPA 9th Division, in their first offensive of the war, stood only a few miles short of Yongsan after a successful river crossing and penetration of the US line. The 3rd Regiment had been left at Inch'on, but division commander Major General Pak Kyo Sam felt the chances of capturing Yongsan were strong. As the KPA 9th Division approached Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on the north and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76 mm artillery battalion from the KPA I Corps, an anti-aircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the KPA 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured KPA document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of KPA I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1. On the morning of September 1, with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Laurence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. = North Korean attack = A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, moved to the south side of the Yongsan-Naktong River road; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road. Approximately west of Yongsan an estimated 300 KPA troops engaged A Company in a fire fight. M19 Gun Motor Carriages of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action, which lasted several hours. Meanwhile, with the approval of the Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking Yongsan. A platoon of infantry went into position behind it. A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of Yongsan on the left flank of D Company. There, A Company went into position along the road; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion, and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company. The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. The KPA had also approached Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in an intense fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven KPA machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy KPA fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, remained on the tank until he was killed. That night KPA soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south. The KPA now attempted a breakthrough of the Engineer position. After daylight, they were unable to get reinforcements into the fight since D Company commanded the town and its approaches. In this fight, which raged until 11:00, the engineers had neither artillery nor mortar support. D Company remedied this by using its new 3.5-inch and old 2.36-inch rocket launchers (Bazookas) against the KPA infantry. The fire of the 18 Bazookas plus that from machine guns and the small arms of the company inflicted very heavy casualties on the KPA, who desperately tried to clear the way for a push eastward to Miryang. Tanks of A and B Companies, 72nd Tank Battalion, at the southern and eastern edge of Yongsan shared equally with the engineers in the intensity of this battle. The company commander was the only officer of D Company not killed or wounded in this melee, which cost the company 12 men killed and 18 wounded. The edge of Yongsan and the slopes of the hill south of the town became covered with KPA dead and destroyed equipment. = Reinforcements = While this battle raged during the morning at Yongsan, commanders reorganized about 800 men of the 9th Infantry who had arrived in that vicinity from the overrun river line positions. Among them were F and G Companies, which were not in the path of major KPA crossings and had succeeded in withdrawing eastward. They had no crew-served weapons or heavy equipment. In midafternoon September 2, tanks and the reorganized US 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry, attacked through A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, into Yongsan, and regained possession of the town at 15:00. Later, two Bazooka teams from A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, knocked out three T-34 tanks just west of Yongsan. US ground and air action destroyed other KPA tanks during the day southwest of the town. By evening the KPA had been driven into the hills westward. In the evening, the 2nd Battalion and A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, occupied the first chain of low hills beyond Yongsan, the engineers west and the 2nd Battalion northwest of the town. For the time being at least, the KPA drive toward Miryang had been halted. In this time, the desperately undermanned US units began to be reinforced with Korean Augmentees (KATUSAs) However, the cultural divide between the KATUSAs and the US troops caused tensions. At 09:35 September 2, while the KPA were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of Yongsan and clear the road to Miryang, Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command in Tokyo. He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions. He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them. He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, under Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, toward Yongsan but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that UN commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them, since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command. Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them. Hickey replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary. A few hours after this conversation, at 13:15, Walker attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co-ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the Marines, with the mission of destroying the KPA east of the Naktong River in the 2nd Division sector and restoring the river line. The Marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished. = September 3 counterattack = A North Korean POW captured by US Marines along Naktong Bulge, September 4. A conference was held that afternoon at the US 2nd Division command post attended by leaders of the Eighth Army, US 2nd Division, and 1st Marine Brigade. A decision was reached that the Marines would attack west at 08:00 on September 3 astride the Yongsan-Naktong River road; the 9th Infantry, B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion, and D Battery of the 82d AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re-establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, remnants of the 1st Battalion, 9th Infantry and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank, or south, of the Marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division. Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan-ni area, south of Miryang and east of the confluence of the Nam River and the Naktong River. There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone. The troops holding this line on the first hills west of Yongsan were G Company, 9th Infantry, north of the road running west through Kogan-ni to the Naktong; A Company, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, southward across the road; and, below the engineers, F Company, 9th Infantry. Between 03:00 and 04:30 September 3, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade moved to forward assembly areas. The 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines assembled north of Yongsan, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines south of it. The 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines established security positions southwest of Yongsan along the approaches into the regimental sector from that direction. During the night, A Company of the engineers had considerable fighting with KPA and never reached its objective. At dawn September 3, A Company attacked to gain the high ground which was part of the designated Marine line of departure. The company fought its way up the slope to within of the top, which was held by the firmly entrenched KPA. At this point the company commander caught a KPA- thrown grenade and was wounded by its fragments as he tried to throw it away from his men. The company with help from Marine tank fire eventually gained its objective, but this early morning battle for the line of departure delayed the planned attack. The Marine attack started at 08:55 across the rice paddy land toward KPA-held high ground westward. The 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, south of the east‚Äìwest road, gained its objective when KPA soldiers broke under air attack and ran down the northern slope and crossed the road to Hill 116 in the 2nd Battalion zone. Air strikes, artillery concentrations, and machine gun and rifle fire of the 1st Battalion now caught KPA reinforcements in open rice paddies moving up from the second ridge and killed most of them. In the afternoon, the 1st Battalion advanced to Hill 91. North of the road the 2nd Battalion had a harder time, encountering heavy KPA fire when it reached the northern tip of Hill 116, west of Yongsan. The KPA held the hill during the day, and at night D Company of the 5th Marines was isolated there. In the fighting west of Yongsan Marine armor knocked out four T-34 tanks, and KPA crew members abandoned a fifth. That night the Marines dug in on a line west of Yongsan. The 2nd Battalion had lost 18 killed and 77 wounded during the day, most of them in D Company. Total Marine casualties for September 3 were 34 killed and 157 wounded. Coordinating its attack with that of the marines, the 9th Infantry advanced abreast of them on the north. = September 4 counterattack = Just before midnight, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, received orders to pass through the 2nd Battalion and continue the attack in the morning. That night torrential rains made the troops miserable and lowered morale. The KPA were unusually quiet and launched few patrols or attacks. The morning of September 4, the weather was clear. The counterattack continued at 08:00 September 4, at first against little opposition. North of the road the 2nd Battalion quickly completed occupation of Hill 116, from which the KPA had withdrawn during the night. South of the road the 1st Battalion occupied what appeared to be a command post of the KPA 9th Division. Tents were still up and equipment lay scattered about. Two abandoned T-34 tanks in excellent condition stood there. Tanks and ground troops advancing along the road found it littered with KPA dead and destroyed and abandoned equipment. By nightfall the counterattack had gained another . That night was quiet until just before dawn. The KPA then launched an attack against the 9th Infantry on the right of the Marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came in the midst of a downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling KPA force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. His sudden attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up KPA positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more KPA soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed a mortar crew. US artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the KPA in this night and day battle. = September 5 counterattack = That morning, September 5, after a 10-minute artillery preparation, the American troops moved out in their third day of counterattack. It was a day of rain. As the attack progressed, the marines approached Obong-ni Ridge and the 9th Infantry neared Cloverleaf Hill where they had fought tenaciously during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the month before. There, at midmorning, on the high ground ahead, they could see KPA troops digging in. The Marines approached the pass between the two hills and took positions in front of the KPA-held high ground. At 14:30 approximately 300 KPA infantry came from the village of Tugok and concealed positions, striking B Company on Hill 125 just north of the road and east of Tugok. Two T-34 tanks surprised and knocked out the two leading Marine M26 Pershing tanks. Since the destroyed Pershing tanks blocked fields of fire, four others withdrew to better positions. Assault teams of B Company and the 1st Battalion with 3.5-inch Bazookas rushed into action, took the tanks under fire, and destroyed both of them, as well as an armored personnel carrier following behind. The KPA infantry attack was brutal and inflicted 25 casualties on B Company before reinforcements from A Company and supporting Army artillery and Marine 81 mm mortars helped repel it. September 5 was a day of heavy casualties everywhere on the Pusan Perimeter. Army units had 102 killed, 430 wounded, and 587 missing in action for a total of 1,119 casualties. Marine units had 35 killed, 91 wounded, for a total of 126 battle casualties. Total American battle casualties for the day were 1,245 men. It is unknown how many KPA were killed or wounded on that day, but they likely suffered heavy casualties. = North Koreans repulsed = During the previous night, at 20:00 September 4, General Walker had ordered the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade released from operational control of the 2nd Division effective at midnight, September 5. He had vainly protested against releasing the brigade, believing he needed it and all the troops then in Korea if he were to stop the KPA offensive against the Pusan Perimeter. At 00:15, September 6, the Marines began leaving their lines at Obong-ni Ridge and headed for Pusan. They would join the 1st Marine Regiment and 7th Marine Regiment in forming the new 1st Marine Division. This was done after a heated disagreement between Walker's command and MacArthur's command. Walker said he could not hold the Pusan Perimeter without the Marines in reserve, while MacArthur said he could not conduct the Inchon landings without the Marines. MacArthur responded by assigning the US 17th Infantry Regiment and later the US 65th Infantry Regiment to Walker's reserves, but Walker did not feel the inexperienced troops would be effective. Walker felt the transition endangered the Perimeter at a time when it was unclear if it would hold. The American counteroffensive of September 3‚Äì5 west of Yongsan, according to prisoner statements, resulted in one of the bloodiest debacles of the war for a KPA division. Even though remnants of the KPA 9th Division, supported by the low strength KPA 4th Division, still held Obong-ni Ridge, Cloverleaf Hill, and the intervening ground back to the Naktong on September 6, the division's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack. The KPA 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive.  Aftermath  The KPA 4th and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles at Naktong Bulge. The 9th Division had numbered 9,350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. The 4th Division numbered 5,500. Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. The majority of the KPA troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The exact number of KPA casualties at Yongsan is impossible to determine, but a substantial amount of the attacking force was lost there. All of KPA II Corps was in a similar state, and the KPA, exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after Inchon, was on the brink of defeat. The US casualty count at Yongsan is also difficult to know, as the division's scattered units were engaged all along the Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the KPA from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan. Once again the fatal weakness of the KPA had cost it victory after an impressive initial success-its communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. By September 8, the KPA attacks in the area had been repulsed.

The film was released direct to home video in 1995. Plot For years, the tiny desert town of Lakeview, Arizona has been ruled by a vicious outlaw biker gang led by a man known as Angel. The residents have been terrified into submission, and the local Sheriff Gordon Cole hasn't been the same since the gang raped and murdered his fianc√©e Bridget for trying to bring evidence of their crimes to the FBI. Tormented by grief and alcoholism, he no longer has the will to stand against them. One day, a mysterious young woman dressed in black leather rides into town on a motorcycle and promptly starts killing members of Angel's gang. When Cole attempts to question her about the murders, he notices her striking resemblance to his fianc√©e and is instantly attracted to her, much to the chagrin of local shopkeeper Sally Womack, who has wanted Cole for herself ever since Bridget's demise. Fearing retaliation from Angel (who is currently out of town) for the deaths of his men, Sally implores Cole to arrest the woman, but he refuses to take any action against her. Undeterred, Sally enlists the help of Cole's corrupt Deputy Steve Stowe and the Mayor of Lakeview to capture her, but their plan ultimately backfires resulting in Stowe's death. Meanwhile the woman, a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, continues to eliminate the bikers one by one as she awaits Angel's return. During her time in Lakeview, the woman gets acquainted with several of the townspeople, most notably Bridget's younger sister Gordet, who has been living as a vagrant ever since witnessing her sister's brutal death. After hearing her story, the woman takes the emotionally shattered girl under her wing and tries to help her reclaim her life. Eventually Cole becomes romantically involved with the woman, but is unable to learn anything about her origin. She is undoubtedly the mirror image of his fianc√©e Bridget, but if the two are related, the woman gives no indication. However, when the subject of Angel is brought up, she angrily admonishes Cole for his inaction, causing him to storm off in a rage. When he tries to confess his love to her, she cryptically responds that he's \\"in love with a ghost.\\" With Angel's return imminent, the residents of Lakeview begin a full-scale evacuation. Though Sally tries to convince Cole to leave with her, he chooses to stay behind and help the woman defend the town. With Gordet acting as a lookout, Cole and the woman are able to work together to dispatch the few remaining members of Angel's gang. Finally, the woman meets Angel face to face on the street, where they fight to the death. Victorious, the woman bids farewell to Cole and Gordet and rides off into the sunset, leaving both of them and the audience to speculate about her identity.

Background and seizure of Pinglu  It is not known when Wang Jingwu was born, but it is known that he was from Qing Prefecture (ÈùíÂ∑û, in modern Weifang, Shandong, the capital of Pinglu Circuit) and that he served as an officer under An Shiru () the military governor of Pinglu. In 881 or 882, there was an agrarian rebellion in the region of Qing and Di (Ê££Â∑û, in modern Binzhou, Shandong) Prefectures, and An sent him to suppress it.New Book of Tang, vol. 187. After he returned to Qing, he expelled An and claimed the title of acting military governor. Thereafter, turning away from his allegiance to the then-reigning Tang emperor Emperor Xizong, he sought and received a commission from Huang Chao, who had several months earlier captured the Tang imperial capital Chang'an, forced Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu, and declared his own state of Qi as its emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Wanting to turn Wang Jingwu's allegiance back to Tang, the Tang chancellor Wang Duo, who was in charge of the operations against Huang, sent the imperial official Zhang Jun to try to persuade Wang Jingwu and bestow the commission of acting military governor. When Zhang arrived at Pinglu, Wang Jingwu initially refused to meet him. When Wang eventually met with Zhang, Zhang rebuked him, and further used a speech to turn the soldiers' opinions toward loyalty to Tang. The soldiers' opinions affected Wang, and Wang decided to accept the Tang commission and sent troops to aid Wang Duo's campaign. Wang Duo subsequently made him military governor. After Tang forces recaptured Chang'an, Wang Jingwu was given the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () and the honorary title of acting Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â, one of the Three Excellencies).  Death and succession  Wang Jingwu died in 889 and was succeeded by his 15-year-old son Wang Shifan. Initially, his subordinate Zhang Chan () refused to accept Wang Shifan as Wang Jingwu's successor, and the imperial government also tried to make the senior general Cui Anqian the new military governor. By 890, however, Wang Shifan had defeated Zhang and Zhang's ally Lu Hong (), and Cui fled back to Chang'an, allowing Wang Shifan to take control.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.

Typical Perry Mason episode In a typical episode of Perry Mason, a series involving a fictional Los Angeles defense attorney which initially ran from September 1957 to May 1966, the first half of the show usually depicted the prospective murder victim as being deserving of homicide, often with Mason's client publicly threatening to kill the victim. After Mason's client is charged with murder, during the preliminary hearing for the trial Mason would establish his client's innocence by dramatically demonstrating the guilt of another character. The real murderer would nearly always break down and confess to the crime in the courtroom, often while on the witness stand.  Jurors  The Perry Mason syndrome purports that, due to the oversimplified manner in which trial proceedings were presented on the popular crime drama Perry Mason, jurors who watched the program would enter trials with misconceptions about how the legal process works. Some argue that the Perry Mason syndrome greatly reinforced the presumption of innocence of the defendant, which may have been problematic when the defendant was guilty. Others argue that, because Perry Mason was often able to cause witnesses to confess, jurors would expect similar \\"Perry Mason moments\\" to occur in real trials as well. This shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense. In one case, a juror told the defense attorney that the jury had voted to convict the defendant because the prosecution's key witness did not confess during cross-examination.  Defendants  The Perry Mason syndrome has been cited as a reason some defendants would choose to appear pro se--representing oneself in court rather than being represented by a lawyer. The simplified portrayals of trials on the television series led some defendants to underestimate the seriousness of their predicaments. Consistent viewers of the show may have also believed that they had gained an intimate understanding of the United States legal system and would be able to represent themselves better than an attorney could. This effect may have been exacerbated by the tendency for news media to oversimplify their coverage of trial proceedings.

Bartholomew is the former CEO and President of the Association of Surfing Professionals and the creator of the Dream Tour format of professional competition surfing.  Surfing career  = Early years = Wayne Bartholomew was born 30 November 1954 in the New South Wales township of Murwillumbah to father Donald 'Bart' Bartholomew (dec.) and mother Betty Bartholomew. He grew up in Coolangatta, Queensland, alongside his four sisters Wendy (dec.), Cindy, Heidi, Louise, and two half-sisters Tanya, and Leah. Bartholomew began surfing at age 13, during the Australian summer of 1967-1968, at his home-town beach Rainbow Bay on the Gold Coast, and the Bay's popular surf break, Snapper Rocks. His first surfboard was a gift from local surfing brothers Wayne and Robye Deane who had heard of the young Bartholomew and his interest in surfing through their parents' friendship with the Bartholomew family, with both families involved in the local Lions Club. The board was a cut down nine foot six inch 'Ron' longboard that had been reshaped by the Deane brothers who were aspiring carpenters at the time, and re-glassed for $20 at a local factory to produce a new seven foot long board. Once complete, the brothers gave the re-designed board to Bartholomew. Wayne has often credited his mother for supporting his surfing interests at a time when surfing was considered an outsider's pursuit and surfing's image was controversial. Early on, Wayne showed a natural talent for surfing which became his daily activity of choice during his later school years, along with any competitive pursuit he could partake in including soccer. Whilst it is often reported that he was given the nickname 'Rabbit' when he was young because of his speed as a soccer player,Wayne Bartholomew profile at Surfline.com and his prominent front teeth, it was actually due to his demonstrated hopping style he adopted when famously attempting to play two pinball machines simultaneously at Gill's Cafe, a favourite beachside haunt in his youth years. As a teenager, Wayne would often surf before, after and occasionally during school hours, perfecting his wave knowledge and tube riding skills on the famed Coolangatta point breaks of Kirra, Greenmount and Snapper Rocks. Wayne once recounted of his youth surfing days living next to the beachfront at Kirra, \\"It was a magical existence. We lived in this little cottage 50 metres from the sea. At night my heart would beat to the rhythm of the tide. And in the morning I'd simply climb out of the window and walk into the surf.\\" = Professional competition = Wayne began surfing at a competition level as a junior in the early 1970s, where he quickly made a name for himself as a fierce competitor and stylish proponent. His first major title came when he was crowned the Australian School Boy Champion in 1972. He would go on to win multiple Queensland Men's Open titles as a semi professional surfing competitor over the next few years. In 1977, Wayne turned full-time professional and finished second behind South African surfer Shaun Tomson in his rookie year. In that same year, he contested the first Stubbies Surf Classic at Burleigh Heads, regarded as the first man-on-man style surfing event ever contested, but was eliminated from the contest by Michael Peterson in the semi finals. Returning to compete in 1978, Wayne dominated the competition on the world tour and secured his first World Surfing Champion title. Spanning a decade, Bartholomew competed on the world professional surfing tour until 1987, ranking in the top five surfers for seven consecutive years. In his professional surfing years, he was widely considered one of the greatest surfers of the period ‚Äî famed for his bold attitude, flamboyant style, fearless competitive drive and tactical insight. = Post world surfing tour = In 1985 Wayne founded the Wayne Bartholomew Academy of Surfing, a pioneering surfing school and frontrunner to today's popular surfing school global movement. The Academy operated until 1992 with Wayne personally providing expert instruction, training and advice to many children and aspiring surfers in Australia. Wayne was appointed as National Coach for the Australian representative surfing team in 1992. The team competed in the 1992 ISA biannual World Surfing Championships in Lacanau, France, taking the gold medal for Australia. In 1994 Wayne returned as head coach to defend his 1992 achievement, returning the Australian team to the podium for a consecutive gold medal result. The ISA World Surfing Championships are known widely as the Olympics of surfing sports. From 1993 to 1998 he operated Elite Rabbit Surf Camps, again focussing on training, coaching and mentoring rising surfing talent and youth. Wayne's surf coaching has endured and from 1987 to 2015 Wayne where he also mentored and coached a variety of local boardrider's club teams to success including leading the Snapper Rocks Surfriders Club at thirteen consecutive Straddie Teams Assault events held at North Stradbroke Island, twelve Kirra Teams Challenge events, two Quiksilver National Surf League events and two National Australian Boardrider's Battles. = World Masters titles = In 1999 Wayne won the ASP Masters World Surfing Champion title in France, the same year he took the helm as president and CEO of the ASP. In 2003 he won the ASP Grand Masters World Surfing Champion title, making him a three-time world surfing champion and further cementing his status as an icon of the sport.  Corporate career  = Association of Surfing Professionals = In 1976 Wayne was part of the Original Founder Group for what is now the modern incarnation of the foremost professional surfing governing body the World Surf League (WSL), and was a cornerstone participant in the formation of a new era of world professional surfing. From 1977 through to 1988, Bartholomew served as Director for the newly formed Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP), which would become the peak governing body for professional surfing competition globally in 1983. During this time he championed reform and development of the sport including initiatives to solidify the man-on-man format of competition as the benchmark standard for surfing competition excellence ‚Äî a format devised by fellow Gold Coast surfing innovator Peter Drouyn at the first Stubbies Surf Classic event in 1977 held at Burleigh Heads in which Wayne was also a prominent competitor, having made the finals in 1977 and returning to win the event in 1978. In 1996 he returned to the ASP as Contest Director for the Gold Coast Billabong Pro world tour event held at Kirra Point on the Gold Coast, an event which successfully ran until 1999 with Wayne as Director and drew large crowds again to Burleigh Point and Kirra Point, attracting significant international media coverage whilst re-establishing the Gold Coast as a significant surfing destination to a global audience. In the decade from 1999 until 2009, Wayne Bartholomew served as the President of the Association of Surfing Professionals, also operating as the President and Chief Executive Office (CEO) from 1999 until 2003, overseeing all operational aspects of the world tour events, business dealings and promotion of surfing as a globally revered sport and lifestyle pursuit. During this period and under Bartholomew's leadership and contribution the sport enjoyed significant growth in the emerging digital age with high-ranking surfers becoming household names on the world surfing stage and financial investment in the sport skyrocketing. Bartholomew introduced the concept of powered personal watercraft or jet skis to assist surfers competing in events to maximise their ability to catch waves when conditions were challenging, a practice which is commonplace nowadays in professional surfing events and big wave surfing. He is credited as having reinvented the professional surfing tour by establishing the 'Dream Tour', a modern format that favoured surfing events being held in formidable world-class surfing conditions at premier surfing locations away from traditional populated centres, as well as incorporating extended waiting periods to ensure the best possible swell and wind conditions for surfers to compete in were realised. Wayne stepped down from his role with the ASP in March 2009. Richard Grellman, Chairman of the ASP Board of Directors at the time, said of Wayne's contributions to the governing of professional surfing that, \\"he has always represented ASP with integrity and candor. He is the visionary that started the Tour and then reinvented it again with the Dream Tour. We have a global, respected professional surf tour thanks to Rabbit and owe him a mountain of thanks.\\" = Billabong = From 1990 until 1999 Wayne was appointed as Special Projects Manger for the emerging global apparel giant Billabong. The company underwent a significant growth period during this time, rising to become a widely recognised international surf and youth-culture clothing brand which was publicly floated in the year 2000 with annual turnover of A$225 million, growing to sales of A$1.7 billion by the year 2011. The initial offering of stock exceeded expectations, with the sale of stock closing early. = Billabong Pro = From 1996 until 1999 Wayne also oversaw the running of the Billabong Pro on the Gold Coast, a premier ASP world surfing tour event and season opener featuring the best surfers in the world competing at the iconic Gold Coast surf breaks of Burleigh Point and Kirra Point. As the official Contest Director, he was responsible for each event in its entirety ‚Äî from the lead up and set up to the conclusion ‚Äî ensuring maximum operational efficiency whilst providing a state-of-the-art experience for competitors and spectators alike. The 1997 event saw Bartholomew move the contest away from its base at Kirra Point to instead compete at Burleigh Point. The move was hailed as a pioneering moment in professional surfing history with the event utilising its flexibility to maximise wave quality and provide the best possible conditions for surfers and spectators. The result of the move showcased Wayne's innovative forward thinking in redeveloping surfing contest formats and brought thousands of fans to Burleigh Point to watch the likes of Kelly Slater, Damien Hardman, Shane Beschan, Mark Occhilupo, Ross Williams, Michael Barry and Peterson Rosa do battle at Burleigh's natural amphitheatre of contest surfing, recreating scenes not witnessed since the Stubbies Surf Classic events on the late 1970s. The 1999 event was the first major surfing event to be broadcast on the internet, making professional surfing freely available to be viewed live by millions of spectators and fans for the first time in the history of the sport. The events were credited as putting the Gold Coast back on the international contest surfing map and sparking a wave of surf tourism and investment for the city. = Other roles = From the late 1980s onwards Wayne has contributed both in a volunteer and a working capacity to various companies, organisations and global initiatives, applying his experience and practical abilities with great success. Some of his appointments have included running Indigenous Surf Camps at the Tallebudgera Recreation Centre in the mid 1990s through to being appointed a Global Ambassador for international wetsuit and surf clothing brand Hurley International from 2010 to 2019. From 1987 until 1992 Wayne served as President of the Snapper Rocks Surfriders Club. In 1996 he was appointed UN Ambassador for the Ocean in the International Year of the Ocean. Wayne has been the Queensland Community Representative on the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypass Committee since 1992. He is currently a Global Ambassador for Gold Coast-based retail company The Surfboard Warehouse, joining prestigious names such as Hollywood actor Jason Momoa and two-time ASP World Longboard Surfing Champion Beau Young.  Politics  = 2020 Queensland State Election = On Sunday 17 August 2020, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that Wayne Bartholomew would be representing Labor and contesting the Queensland Parliament seat of Burleigh at the 2020 Queensland state election against incumbent Liberal National Party member Michael Hart. At the time of the announcement of his candidacy, Bartholomew told local media, \\"This is not an easy time for anyone in this country and it's not an easy time in the world, so I want to step up now ... I challenge anyone to love the Gold Coast more than I do.\\"  Personal life  The award-winning documentary Bustin' Down the Door depicts Rabbit's early days in Coolangatta, Queensland and his roller coaster ride to the top, overcoming obstacles along the way in his bid to bring credibility to the sport and draws upon his earlier biography, Bustin' Down the Door ‚Äî first published in 1996 and reprinted in 2002. In 1987 he was inducted into the Australian Surfing Hall of Fame. In 2001, Wayne's eldest sister Wendy Scadden was diagnosed with brain cancer, beginning a lengthy battle against the disease. In a 2010 interview with the USA based Surfer Magazine, Wayne was asked if he could trade his 1978 World Title for anything in the world, what would it be, to which he answered, \\"There is no doubt about it, as one gets older the appreciation grows for the simple act of riding waves, paddling in the ocean and enjoying the health to do it. World Championship glory dims considerably in the clear light of a beautiful day. If I could wish for one thing, and give it all back, it would be the recovery of my sister Wendy.\\" On the 5th of February 2018, after a 17-year battle against cancer, Wendy passed away. She was 65 years of age, married and had two children and two grandchildren. In 2009 Bartholomew was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame. In 2009, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II via the Governor General of Australia Dame Quentin Bryce, for his services to surfing as a competitor, administrator and mentor, and to the environment through support for a range of coastal conservation groups. In 2016 Wayne was appointed the Official Patron of the newly established Gold Coast World Surfing Reserve which covers the southern coastal shores of the Godl Coast and encompasses the famous surf breaks of Snapper Rocks, Rainbow Bay, Greenmount, Kirra, Currumbin Alley and Burleigh Heads. Wayne remains active as a surfer, campaigner, mentor, ambassador and community leader. He has three sons, Jaggar (2001), Keo (2003) and Cruz (2011).

Opened in 1859, it forms part of the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Civitavecchia railway station is situated in Viale della Repubblica, a short distance to the southeast of both the town centre and the main entrance to the port. History The station was opened on 24 April 1859, upon the inauguration of the Rome‚ÄìCivitavecchia section of the Pisa‚ÄìLivorno‚ÄìRome railway. The original, temporary, station facilities were replaced on 2 July 1860, when the permanent station was placed into service. On 27 June 1867, Civitavecchia ceased to be a terminus, when the line was extended to the north, as far as Nunziatella, on the border between the Papal States and Tuscany. Between 1928 and 1961, Civitavecchia was the junction for a branch line to Orte. That line is currently disused, but in September 2010 a contract was let for its reconstruction. Features View of the main platform Civitavecchia's passenger building is a mostly single storey structure, with a double storey central section. It houses ticket offices and a waiting room. The station has four through tracks, and two terminating tracks, with platforms for passengers. The platforms are linked by an underpass. There is also a freight yard. Further north are offices, a storage area for locomotives, and Civitavecchia Porto Tarquina, where wagons are repaired. To the south was once a goods line, now abandoned, which branched off from the station towards the port. It has been replaced by a paved area now used as a parking lot. Passenger and train movements E464 class locomotive with a commuter train at Civitavecchia. The station has about 3.2 million passenger movements each year. All InterCity, Eurostar City trains passing through the station stop there, as do a pair of InterCity Notte trains (InterCity Night). The station is occasionally a stop or terminus for the Express train UNITALSI, a train of pilgrims. Very frequent regional trains link Civitavecchia with nearby destinations, including Rome, Grosseto, Montalto di Castro and Pisa. The station is also the terminus of the FR5 commuter service from Rome, with a train every 30 minutes.

It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well- equipped base; Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades. The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware of the impact of a blockade on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice. The Singapore strategy was the cornerstone of British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, according to Captain Stephen Roskill, \\"the concept of the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ\\". A combination of financial, political and practical difficulties ensured that it could not be successfully implemented. During the 1930s, the strategy came under sustained criticism in Britain and abroad, particularly in Australia, where the Singapore strategy was used as an excuse for parsimonious defence policies. The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of Force Z to Singapore and the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The subsequent ignominious fall of Singapore was described by Winston Churchill as \\"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history\\".  Origins  After the First World War, the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet that had challenged the Royal Navy for supremacy was scuttled in Scapa Flow, but the Royal Navy was already facing serious challenges to its position as the world's most powerful fleet from the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The United States' determination to create what Admiral of the Navy George Dewey called \\"a navy second to none\\" presaged a new maritime arms race. alt=Map of the world indicating the extent of the British Empire The U.S. Navy was smaller than the Royal Navy in 1919, but ships laid down under its wartime construction program were still being launched, and their more recent construction gave the American ships a technological edge. The \\"two-power standard\\" of 1889 called for a Royal Navy strong enough to take on any two other powers. In 1909, this was scaled back to a policy of 60% superiority in dreadnoughts. Rising tensions over the U.S. Navy's building program led to heated arguments between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, and the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William S. Benson in March and April 1919, although, as far back as 1909, the government directed that the United States was not to be regarded as a potential enemy. This decision was reaffirmed by Cabinet in August 1919 in order to preclude the U.S. Navy's building program from becoming a justification for the Admiralty initiating one of its own. In 1920, the First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Walter Long announced a \\"one-power standard\\", under which the policy was to maintain a navy \\"not ... inferior in strength to the Navy of any other power\\". The one- power standard became official when it was publicly announced at the 1921 Imperial Conference. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 reinforced this policy. The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions met at the 1921 Imperial Conference to determine a unified international policy, particularly the relationship with the United States and Japan. The most urgent issue was that of whether or not to renew the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which was due to expire on 13 July 1921. On one side were the Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes and the Prime Minister of New Zealand Bill Massey, who strongly favoured its renewal. Neither wanted their countries to be caught up in a war between the United States and Japan, and contrasted the generous assistance that Japan rendered during the First World War with the United States' disengagement from international affairs in its aftermath. \\"The British Empire\\", declared Hughes, \\"must have a reliable friend in the Pacific\\". They were opposed by the Prime Minister of Canada, Arthur Meighen, on the grounds that the alliance would adversely affect the relationship with the United States, which Canada depended upon for its security. As a result, no decision to renew was reached, and the alliance was allowed to expire. The Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 provided for a 5:5:3 ratio of capital ships of the British, United States and Japanese navies. Throughout the 1920s, the Royal Navy remained the world's largest navy, with a comfortable margin of superiority over Japan, which was regarded as the most likely adversary. The Washington Naval Treaty also prohibited the fortification of islands in the Pacific, but Singapore was specifically excluded. The provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, however, restricted naval construction, resulting in a serious decline in the British shipbuilding industry. Germany's willingness to limit the size of its navy led to the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935. This was seen as signalling a sincere desire to avoid conflict with Britain. In 1934, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield, began to press for a new naval build-up sufficient to fight both Japan and the strongest European power. He intended to accelerate construction to the maximum capacity of the shipyards, but the Treasury soon became alarmed at the potential cost of the program, which was costed at between ¬£88 and ¬£104 million. By 1938, the Treasury was losing its fight to stop rearmament; politicians and the public were more afraid of being caught unprepared for war with Germany and Japan than of a major financial crisis in the more distant future.  Plans  RMS Queen Mary in Singapore Graving Dock, August 1940alt=A massive ocean liner, viewed from aft and above, sits in a dry dock. The Singapore strategy was a series of war plans that evolved over a twenty-year period in which the basing of a fleet at Singapore was a common but not a defining aspect. Plans were crafted for different contingencies, both defensive and offensive. Some were designed to defeat Japan, while others were merely to deter aggression. In November 1918, the Australian Minister for the Navy, Sir Joseph Cook, had asked Admiral Lord Jellicoe to draw up a scheme for the Empire's naval defence. Jellicoe set out on a tour of the Empire in the battlecruiser in February 1919. He presented his report to the Australian government in August 1919. In a section of the report classified as secret, he advised that the interests of the British Empire and Japan would inevitably clash. He called for the creation of a British Pacific Fleet strong enough to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy, which he believed would require 8 battleships, 8 battlecruisers, 4 aircraft carriers, 10 cruisers, 40 destroyers, 36 submarines and supporting auxiliaries. Although he did not specify a location, Jellicoe noted that the fleet would require a major dockyard somewhere in the Far East. A paper entitled \\"The Naval Situation in the Far East\\" was considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence in October 1919. In this paper the naval staff pointed out that maintaining the Anglo-Japanese Alliance might lead to war between the British Empire and the United States. In 1920, the Admiralty issued War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920, a series of instructions in the event of a war with Japan. In it, the defence of Singapore was described as \\"absolutely essential\\". The strategy was presented to the Dominions at the 1923 Imperial Conference. The authors of War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920 divided a war with Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the garrison of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet made its way from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms. Most planning focused on the first phase, which was seen as the most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a graving dock capable of taking battleships at Pearl Harbor between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of Malta. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific in case of a war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while Sydney was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location. War Memorandum (Eastern), The Route to the East The estimate of how long it would take for the fleet to reach Singapore after the outbreak of hostilities varied. It had to include the time required to assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days. To facilitate this movement, a series of oil storage facilities were constructed at Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Port Sudan, Aden, Colombo, Trincomalee, Rangoon, Singapore, and Hong Kong. A complicating factor was that the battleships could not traverse the Suez Canal fully laden, so they would have to refuel on the other side. Singapore was to have storage for of oil. Secret bases were established at Kamaran Bay, Addu Atoll and Nancowry. It was estimated that the fleet would require of oil per month, which would be transported in 60 tankers. Oil would be shipped in from the refineries at Abadan and Rangoon, supplemented by buying up the entire output of the Netherlands East Indies. The third phase received the least consideration, but naval planners were aware that Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila being used as a forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice. alt=A view of a large warship from the floor of a dry dock Japan's vulnerability to blockade was studied. Using information supplied by the Board of Trade and the naval attach√© in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, and many of the best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available. The problem with enforcing a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering off the coast of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the East Indies or the Panama Canal. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable. Rear Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond, the Commander in Chief, East Indies Station, noted that the logic was suspiciously circular: The 1919 plans incorporated a Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation (MNBDO) which could develop and defend a forward base. The MNBDO had a strength of 7,000 and included a brigade of antiaircraft artillery, a brigade of coastal artillery and a battalion of infantry, all drawn from the Royal Marines. In one paper exercise, the Royal Marines occupied Nakagusuku Bay unopposed and the MNBDO developed a major base there from which the fleet blockaded Japan. Actual fleet exercises were conducted in the Mediterranean in the 1920s to test the MNBDO concept. However, the Royal Marines were not greatly interested in amphibious warfare, and lacking organisational backing, the techniques and tactics of amphibious warfare began to atrophy. By the 1930s the Admiralty was concerned that the United States and Japan were well ahead of Britain in this field and persuaded the Army and RAF to join with it in establishing the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre, which opened in July 1938. Under its first commandant, Captain Loben Edward Harold Maund, it began investigating the problems of amphibious warfare, including the design of landing craft. Nor was this the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the Master of Sempill led the semi-official Sempill Mission to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy establish an air arm. At the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment. Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain. The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in limiting the number of aircraft that a carrier could operate. The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters. To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed multi-role aircraft such as the Blackburn Roc, Fairey Fulmar, Fairey Barracuda, Blackburn Skua and Fairey Swordfish. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were no match for their Japanese counterparts. The possibility of Japan taking advantage of a war in Europe was foreseen. In June 1939, the Tientsin Incident demonstrated another possibility: that Germany might attempt to take advantage of a war in the Far East. In the event of a worst-case scenario of simultaneous war with Germany, Italy and Japan, two approaches were considered. The first was to reduce the war to one against Germany and Japan only by knocking Italy out of the conflict as quickly as possible. The former First Sea Lord, Sir Reginald Drax, who was brought out of retirement to advise on strategy, called for a \\"flying squadron\\" of four or five battleships, along with an aircraft carrier, some cruisers and destroyers, to be sent to Singapore. Such a force would be too small to fight the Japanese main fleet, but could protect British trade in the Indian Ocean against commerce raiders. Drax argued that a small, fast force would be better in this role than a large, slow one. When more ships became available, it could become the nucleus of a full-sized battle fleet. Chatfield, now Minister for Coordination of Defence, disagreed with this concept. He felt that the flying squadron would become nothing more than a target for the Japanese fleet. Instead, he put forward a second approach, namely that the Mediterranean be abandoned and the fleet sent to Singapore.  Base development  alt=A large calibre gun fires, creating a cloud of smoke Following surveys, a site at Sembawang was chosen for a naval base. The Straits Settlements made a free gift of of land for the site, and a sum of ¬£250,000 for construction of the base was donated by Hong Kong in 1925. That exceeded the United Kingdom's contribution that year of ¬£204,000 towards the floating dock. Another ¬£2,000,000 was paid by the Federated Malay States, while New Zealand donated another ¬£1,000,000. The contract for construction of the naval dockyard was awarded to the lowest bidder, Sir John Jackson Limited, for ¬£3,700,000. Some of earth were moved to level the ground, and of marsh was filled in. The floating dock was constructed in England and towed to Singapore by Dutch tugboats. It was long and wide, making it one of the largest in the world. There would be of deep water quays, and supporting infrastructure including warehouses, workshops and hospitals. To defend the naval base, heavy 15-inch naval guns (381.0 mm) were stationed at Johore battery, Changi, and at Buona Vista to deal with battleships. Medium BL 9.2 inch guns (233.7 mm) were provided for dealing with smaller attackers. Batteries of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns and guns for dealing with raids were located at Fort Siloso, Fort Canning and Labrador. The five 15-inch guns were all surplus Navy guns, manufactured between 1903 and 1919. Part of their cost was met from a gift of ¬£500,000 from Sultan Ibrahim of Johor for the Silver Jubilee of the coronation King George V. Three of the guns were given an all-round (360¬∞) traverse and subterranean magazines. Aviation was not neglected. Plans called for an air force of 18 flying boats, 18 reconnaissance fighters, 18 torpedo bombers and 18 single-seat fighters to protect them. Royal Air Force airfields were established at RAF Tengah and RAF Sembawang. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Lord Trenchard, argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and Portsmouth in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were to have a chance of hitting a battleship. The King George VI dry dock was formally opened by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Shenton Thomas, on 14 February 1938. Two squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm provided a flypast. The 42 vessels in attendance included three US Navy cruisers. The presence of this fleet gave an opportunity to conduct a series of naval, air and military exercises. The aircraft carrier was able to sail undetected to within of Singapore and launch a series of surprise raids on the RAF airfields. The local air commander, Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Tedder, was greatly embarrassed. The local land commander, Major-General Sir William Dobbie, was no less disappointed by the performance of the anti-aircraft defences. Reports recommended the installation of radar on the island, but this was not done until 1941. The naval defences worked better, but a landing party from was still able to capture the Raffles Hotel. What most concerned Dobbie and Tedder was the possibility of the fleet being bypassed entirely by an overland invasion of Malaya from Thailand. Dobbie conducted an exercise in southern Malaya which demonstrated that the jungle was far from impassable. The Chiefs of Staff Committee concluded that the Japanese would most likely land on the east coast of Malaya and advance on Singapore from the north.  Australia  In Australia the conservative Nationalist Party government of Stanley Bruce latched onto the Singapore strategy, which called for reliance on the British navy, supported by a naval squadron as strong as Australia could afford. Between 1923 and 1929, ¬£20,000,000 was spent on the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), while the Australian Army and the munitions industry received only ¬£10,000,000 and the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) just ¬£2,400,000. The policy had the advantage of pushing responsibility for Australian defence onto Britain. Unlike New Zealand, Australia declined to contribute to the cost of the base at Singapore. In petitioning a parsimonious government for more funds, the Australian Army had to refute the Singapore strategy, \\"an apparently well- argued and well-founded strategic doctrine that had been endorsed at the highest levels of imperial decision-making\\". 8th Division disembark at Singapore Harbour 15 August 1941.alt=Men in shorts and slouch hats with rifles slung, carrying duffel bags march along a wharf. In the background is a cruise ship. An alternative policy was put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, which was in opposition for all but two years of the 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost ¬£7,000,000 while an aircraft cost ¬£2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position. In September 1926, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Wynter gave a lecture to the United Services Institute of Victoria entitled \\"The Strategical Inter- relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: an Australian View\\", which was published in the April 1927 edition of British Army Quarterly. In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN. \\"Henceforward\\", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, \\"the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in your beliefs but, frankly, we do not think you will be able to do it. Frederick Shedden wrote a paper putting the case for the Singapore strategy as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel John Lavarack, who had attended the Imperial Defence College class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure. When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in British Army Quarterly in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal. In 1936, the leader of the opposition John Curtin read an article by Wynter in the House of Representatives. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post. Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, to replace Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff. Within months, the Chief of the Air Staff was replaced with a British officer as well.  New Zealand  Successive New Zealand governments‚Äîthe Reform Government of 1912‚Äì1928, United Government in 1928‚Äì1931, United-Reform Coalition Government of 1931‚Äì1935, and the First Labour Government in 1935‚Äì1949‚Äîall supported the Singapore Strategy. The New Zealand financial contribution was eight annual payments of ¬£125,000, a million pounds in total, rather than the ¬£225,000 annually proposed by the Admiralty. Expansion of the New Zealand Devonport Naval Base was also proposed, and in 1926 the alternative of a third cruiser was considered. Labour, on coming to power in 1935, gave more importance to a local air force, though later Walter Nash accepted the need to keep sea lanes open. There was little liaison with Australia; in 1938 New Zealand Chiefs of Staff papers were sent to London but not Australia. But by 1936 New Zealand military confidence in the Singapore Strategy was waning; with the possibility of Italy as well as Germany and Japan as enemies, in seemed likely that Britain would also be committed in the Mediterranean.  Second World War  alt=a warship With war with Germany now a reality, Menzies sent Richard Casey to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia in the event that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November 1939, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore would not be allowed to fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take priority over the Mediterranean. This seemed possible as the Kriegsmarine, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East. During 1940, the situation slowly but inexorably slid towards a worst-case scenario. In June, Italy joined the war on Germany's side and France was knocked out. The Chiefs of Staff Committee now reported: There remained the prospect of American assistance. In secret talks in Washington, D.C., in June 1939, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William D. Leahy raised the possibility of an American fleet being sent to Singapore. In April 1940, the American naval attach√© in London, Captain Alan Kirk, approached the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Phillips, to ask if, in the event of the United States Fleet being sent to the Far East, the docking facilities at Singapore could be made available, as those at Subic Bay were inadequate. He received full assurances that they would be. Hopes for American assistance were dashed at the staff conference in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. The U.S. Navy was primarily focused on the Atlantic. The American chiefs envisaged relieving British warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean so a British fleet could be sent to the Far East. alt=a warship In July 1941, the Japanese occupied Cam Ranh Bay, which the British fleet had hoped to use on its northward drive. This put the Japanese uncomfortably close to Singapore. As diplomatic relations with Japan worsened, in August 1941, the Admiralty and the Chiefs of Staff began considering what ships could be sent. The Chiefs of Staff decided to recommend sending to the Far East from the Mediterranean, followed by four s that were refitting at home and in the United States, but Barham was sunk by a German U-boat in November 1941. Three weeks later the remaining two battleships at Alexandria, and were seriously damaged by Italian human torpedoes. While no more destroyers or cruisers were available, the Admiralty decided that an aircraft carrier, the small HMS Eagle could be sent. Winston Churchill, now the Prime Minister, noted that since the German battleship Tirpitz was tying up a superior British fleet, a small British fleet at Singapore might have a similar disproportionate effect on the Japanese. The Foreign Office expressed the opinion that the presence of modern battleships at Singapore might deter Japan from entering the war. In October 1941, the Admiralty therefore ordered to depart for Singapore, where it would be joined by . The carrier was to join them, but it ran aground off Jamaica on 3 November, and no other carrier was available. In August 1940, the Chiefs of Staff Committee reported that the force necessary to hold Malaya and Singapore in the absence of a fleet was 336 first-line aircraft and a garrison of nine brigades. Churchill then sent reassurances to the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand that, if they were attacked, their defence would be a priority second only to that of the British Isles. A defence conference was held in Singapore in October 1940. Representatives from all three services attended, including Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton (Commander in Chief, China Station); the General Officer Commanding Malaya Command, Lieutenant General Lionel Bond; and Air Officer Commanding the RAF in the Far East, Air Marshal John Tremayne Babington. Australia was represented by its three deputy service chiefs, Captain Joseph Burnett, Major General John Northcott and Air Commodore William Bostock. Over ten days, they discussed the situation in the Far East. They estimated that the air defence of Burma and Malaya would require a minimum of 582 aircraft. By 7 December 1941, there were only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and all the fighters were the obsolete Brewster F2A Buffalo. The land forces situation was not much better. There were only 31 battalions of infantry of the 48 required, and instead of two tank regiments, there were no tanks at all. Moreover, many of the units on hand were poorly trained and equipped. Yet during 1941 Britain had sent 676 aircraft and 446 tanks to the Soviet Union. The Japanese were aware of the state of the Singapore defences. There were spies in Singapore, such as Captain Patrick Heenan, and a copy of the Chiefs of Staff's August 1940 appreciation was among the secret documents captured by the German surface raider Atlantis from the on 11 November 1940. The report was handed over to the Japanese, and the detailed knowledge of Singapore's defences thus obtained may have encouraged the Japanese to attack. On 8 December 1941, the Japanese occupied the Shanghai International Settlement. A couple of hours later, landings began at Kota Bharu in Malaya. An hour after that, the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor. On 10 December, Prince of Wales and Repulse, sailing to meet the Malaya invasion force, were sunk by Japanese air attack. After the disastrous Malayan Campaign, Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942. During the final stages of the campaign, the 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns had bombarded targets at Johor Bahru, RAF Tengah and Bukit Timah.  Aftermath  = Fall of Singapore = The fall of Singapore was described by Winston Churchill as \\"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history\\". It was a profound blow to the prestige and morale of the British Empire. The promised fleet had not been sent, and the fortress that had been declared \\"impregnable\\" had been quickly captured. Nearly 139,000 troops were lost, of whom about 130,000 were captured. The 38,000 British casualties included most of the British 18th Infantry Division, which had been ordered to Malaya in January. There were also 18,000 Australian casualties, including most of the Australian 8th Division, and 14,000 local troops; but the majority of the defenders‚Äîsome 67,000 of them‚Äîwere from British India. About 40,000 of the Indian prisoners of war subsequently joined the Japanese- sponsored Indian National Army. Lieutenant General alt=Four British soldiers in shorts and steel helmets, and three Japanese soldiers, one wearing a steel helmet. The British are carrying a Union Flag and a white flag. Richmond, in a 1942 article in The Fortnightly Review, charged that the loss of Singapore illustrated \\"the folly of not providing adequately for the command of the sea in a two-ocean war\\". He now argued that the Singapore strategy had been totally unrealistic. Privately he blamed politicians who had allowed Britain's sea power to be run down. The resources provided for the defence of Malaya were inadequate to hold Singapore, and the manner in which those resources were employed was frequently wasteful, inefficient and ineffective. The disaster had both political and military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill suggested that an official inquiry into the disaster should be held after the war. When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the inquiry. The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as it would not be possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister Clement Attlee accepted this advice, and no inquiry was ever held. In Australia and New Zealand, after years of reassurances, there was a sense of betrayal. According to one historian, \\"In the end, no matter how you cut it, the British let them down\\". The defeat would affect politics for decades. In a speech in the Australian House of Representatives in 1992, Prime Minister Paul Keating cited the sense of betrayal: A fleet was necessary for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy. The Singapore Naval Base suffered little damage in the fighting and became the Imperial Japanese Navy's most important facility outside of the Japanese home islands. The 15-inch guns were sabotaged by the British before the fall of Singapore, and four of them were deemed beyond repair and scrapped by the Japanese. The floating dry dock was scuttled by the British, but raised by the Japanese. It was damaged beyond repair by a raid by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses in February 1945, and ultimately towed out to sea and dumped in 1946. The Royal Navy retook possession of the Singapore base in 1945. = Operation Mastodon = In 1958, the Singapore strategy was revived in the form of Operation Mastodon, a plan to deploy V bombers of RAF Bomber Command equipped with nuclear weapons to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the V bombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at RAF Gan in the Maldives. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for V bombers, so RAF Butterworth had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications. Mastodon called for the deployment of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, most of which were of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each V bomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the V bomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO. In the meantime, the Royal Navy deployed the aircraft carrier with Red Beards and nuclear-capable Supermarine Scimitars to the Far East in 1960. As with the original Singapore strategy, there were doubts as to whether 24 V bombers could be spared in the event of a crisis dire enough to require them, especially after China's acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1964. As the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation heated up in 1963, Bomber Command sent detachments of Victors and Vulcans to the Far East. Over the next three years, four V bombers were permanently stationed there, with squadrons in the United Kingdom rotating detachments. In April 1965, No. 35 Squadron RAF carried out a rapid deployment of its eight Vulcans to RAAF Butterworth and RAF Tengah. Air Chief Marshal Sir John Grandy reported that the V bombers \\"provided a valuable deterrent to confrontation being conducted on a large scale\\". In 1965, racial, political, and personal tensions led to Singapore seceding from Malaysia and becoming an independent country. With the end of the confrontation, the last V bombers were withdrawn in 1966. The following year, the British government announced its intention to withdraw its forces from East of Suez. The Singapore Naval Base was handed over to the government of Singapore on 8 December 1968, and Sembawang Shipyard subsequently became the basis of a successful ship repair industry. The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.

The Pacers were considered a dynasty in the ABA, winning three titles and six conference titles. The Pacers play in the Eastern Conference and Central Division, and they play their home games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.The Pacers have enjoyed sparring moments of success in the NBA, most notably during the career of Reggie Miller, however have never won an NBA championship. 1967‚Äì1976: ABA dynasty In early 1967, a group of six investors (among them attorney Richard Tinkham, John DeVoe, Chuck DeVoe, sports agent Chuck Barnes and Indianapolis Star sports writer Bob Collins) pooled their resources to purchase a franchise in the proposed American Basketball Association. According to Indianapolis attorney Richard Tinkham, the nickname \\"Pacers\\" was decided on through a collective decision of the original investors. Tinkham, one of those investors, recalled that the nickname was a combination of the state's rich history with the harness racing pacers and the pace car used for the running of the Indianapolis 500. Investor Chuck Barnes was a horse racing enthusiast in addition to being business manager of Mario Andretti, A. J. Foyt and Rodger Ward. Barnes' wife, Lois, suggested the name over dinner. Tinkham said the \\"Pacers\\" decision was an easy one, but the real debate was whether the team should be called the Indiana Pacers or the Indianapolis Pacers. Since one of the original ideas for the team was to schedule games throughout the state with its base in Indianapolis, the official team name became the Indiana Pacers. For their first seven years, they played in the Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum, now called the Pepsi Coliseum. In 1974, they moved to the plush new Market Square Arena in downtown Indianapolis, where they stayed for 25 years. Early in the Pacers' second season, former Indiana Hoosiers standout Bob \\"Slick\\" Leonard became the team's head coach, replacing Larry Staverman. Leonard quickly turned the Pacers into a juggernaut. His teams were buoyed by the great play of superstars such as Jimmy Rayl, Mel Daniels, George McGinnis, Freddie Lewis, Bob Netolicky, Rick Mount and Roger Brown. The Indiana Pacers were one of only two teams (along with the Kentucky Colonels) to play for the entire duration of the ABA without relocating, changing its team name or folding. They were also the most successful team in the league's nine-year history, appearing in five ABA Finals and winning three ABA Championships over a four year period, feats that were never bettered by any other ABA franchise. 1976‚Äì1987: Early NBA struggles =First NBA season (1976‚Äì1977)= The Pacers were one of four ABA teams that joined the NBA in the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger in 1976. For the 1976‚Äì77 season the Pacers were joined in the merged league by the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets and San Antonio Spurs of the ABA. Financially, the Pacers were by far the weakest of the four ABA refugees. Indeed, they were on far weaker financial footing than the team acknowledged to be the last ABA team left out of the expansion, the Kentucky Colonels. The Pacers only made the cut because the Chicago Bulls owned the NBA rights to the Colonels' last remaining star, Artis Gilmore, and wouldn't have allowed the merger to go through if the Colonels had been included. The Pacers' financial troubles dated back to their waning days in the ABA; they already begun selling off some of their star players in the last ABA season. They were further weakened by the price required to join the NBA. The league charged a $3.2 million entry fee to each former ABA team. Because the NBA would only agree to accept four ABA teams in the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger, the Pacers and the three other surviving ABA teams also had to compensate the two remaining ABA franchises which were not a part of the merger. The new NBA teams also were barred from sharing in national TV revenues for four years. As a result of the steep price they paid to join the NBA, the Pacers were in a dire financial situation. It took a $100,000 contribution from a group of local businesses to keep the franchise going through June 1977. The team announced that unless season-ticket sales reached 8,000 by the end of July 1977, the club would be sold to someone who might take the franchise elsewhere. WTTV, which was the television flagship for Pacers' games at the time, offered to hold a 16.5 hour telethon to keep the team in Indiana. The telethon began on the night of July 3, 1977, and the next day, 10 minutes before the show was set to go off the air, it was announced that team officials had reached the 8,000-ticket goal. In part because of the telethon, the Pacers' average attendance jumped from 7,615 during the 1976‚Äì77 season to 10,982 during the 1977‚Äì78 season. They finished their inaugural NBA season with a record of 36‚Äì46, as Billy Knight and Don Buse were invited to represent Indiana in the NBA All-Star Game. This was one of the few highlights of the Pacers' first 13 years in the league‚Äîa time in which they had but one winning season and just two playoff appearances. =1977‚Äì1980= A lack of year-to-year continuity became the norm for most of the next decade, as they traded away Knight and Buse before the 1977‚Äì78 season even started. They acquired Adrian Dantley in exchange for Knight, but Dantley (who was averaging nearly 27 points per game at the time) was traded in December, while the Pacers' second-leading scorer, John Williamson, was dealt in January. As a result of their poor performance, the Pacers needed to resort to publicity stunts to attract fans' attention. Before the 1979 season started, they offered women's basketball star Ann Meyers a tryout contract and invited her to the team's training camp. She became the first and, to this date, only woman to try out for an NBA team, but did not make the final squad.http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/question_060831.html =1980‚Äì1987= During this time, the Pacers came out on the short end of two of the most one- sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets in order to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis. McGinnis was past his prime, and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on to become one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens. Owens only played one year for the Pacers with little impact. This trade looked even more horrendous three years later. In 1983‚Äì84, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft‚Äîthe pick that the Blazers famously used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history‚Äîincluding such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Sam Perkins, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton. The Pacers made their first appearance in the NBA Playoffs in 1980‚Äì81, falling in the opening round to the Philadelphia 76ers in two straight games. It was the team's only playoff appearance from 1977 to 1986. Clark Kellogg was drafted by the Pacers in the 1982 and showed tremendous promise, finishing second in the Rookie of the Year voting, but the Pacers finished the 1982‚Äì83 season with their all-time worst record of 20‚Äì62, and won only 26 games the following season. After winning 22 games in 1984‚Äì85 and 26 games in 1985‚Äì86, Jack Ramsay replaced George Irvine as coach and led the Pacers to a 41‚Äì41 record in 1986‚Äì87 and only their second playoff appearance as an NBA team. Chuck Person, nicknamed \\"The Rifleman\\" for his renowned long-range shooting, led the team in scoring as a rookie and won NBA Rookie of the Year honors. Their first playoff win in NBA franchise history was earned in Game 3 of their first-round, best-of-five series against the Atlanta Hawks, but it was their only victory in that series, as the Hawks defeated them in four games. 1987‚Äì2005: Reggie Miller era =1987‚Äì1989= UCLA's Reggie Miller was drafted by the Pacers in 1987, beginning his career as a backup to John Long. Many fans at the time disagreed with Miller's selection over Indiana Hoosiers' standout Steve Alford. The Pacers missed the playoffs in 1987‚Äì88, drafted Rik Smits in the 1988 NBA draft, and suffered through a disastrous 1988‚Äì89 season in which coach Jack Ramsay stepped down following an 0‚Äì7 start. Mel Daniels and George Irvine filled in on an interim basis before Dick Versace took over the 6‚Äì23 team on the way to a 28‚Äì54 finish. In February 1989, the team did manage to make a trade that would eventually pay off, as they traded veteran center Herb Williams to the Dallas Mavericks for future NBA 6th Man-of-the Year Detlef Schrempf. =1989‚Äì1990= In 1989‚Äì90, the Pacers parlayed a fast start into the team's third playoff appearance. But the Pacers were swept by the Detroit Pistons, who would go on to win their second consecutive NBA Championship. Reggie Miller became the first Pacer to play in the All-Star Game since 1976 on the strength of his 24.6 points-per-game average. =1990‚Äì1992= In 1990‚Äì91, the Pacers returned to the playoffs with a 41‚Äì41 record, and Schrempf was named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year. Bob Hill was head coach at this time. The Pacers had a memorable series against the highly favored Boston Celtics that they managed to extend to five games before losing Game 5, 124‚Äì121, with Larry Bird hosting one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. During that season the Pacers changed logos for the first time, and also unveiled new uniforms designed by Olympic gold medallist Florence Griffith Joyner. The Pacers returned to the playoffs in 1992 and met the Celtics for the second year in a row. But this time, the Celtics left no doubt who was the better team, as they swept the Pacers in three straight games. =1992‚Äì1993= Chuck Person and point guard Micheal Williams were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the offseason, and the Pacers got Pooh Richardson and Sam Mitchell in return. For the 1992‚Äì93 season, Detlef Schrempf moved from sixth man to the starter at small forward and was elected to his first All-Star game. Miller, meanwhile, became the Pacers' all-time NBA era leading scorer during this season (4th overall). The Pacers returned to the playoffs with a 41‚Äì41 record, but lost to the New York Knicks in the first round, three games to one. =1993‚Äì1994= Larry Brown was brought on as Pacers' coach for the 1993‚Äì94 season, and Pacers' general manager Donnie Walsh completed a highly-criticized (at the time) trade as he sent Schrempf to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Derrick McKey and little known Gerald Paddio. But the Pacers, who began the season in typically average fashion, kicked it up a notch in April, winning their last eight games of the season to finish with an NBA-era franchise-high 47 wins. They stormed past Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic in a first-round sweep to earn their first NBA playoff series win, and pulled off a tremendous upset by defeating the top- seeded Atlanta Hawks in the Conference Semifinals. It was during the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals that the Pacers‚Äîparticularly Reggie Miller‚Äîfinally became a household name. With the series tied 2‚Äì2 going into game 5 in New York, Miller had the first of many legendary playoff performances. With the Pacers trailing the Knicks by 15 points early in the 4th quarter, Miller scored 25 points in the 4th quarter, including five 3-point field goals. Miller also famously flashed the choke sign to Knick fans while leading the Pacers to the improbable come from behind victory. The Knicks ultimately came back to win the next two games and the series, but Reggie became an NBA superstar overnight. Miller was a tri-captain and leading scorer of the USA Basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1994 FIBA World Championship. =1994‚Äì1995= Mark Jackson joined the team in an offseason trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, giving the team the steady hand at the point guard position that had been lacking in recent years. The Pacers enjoyed a 52‚Äì30 campaign in 1994‚Äì95, giving them their first Central Division title and their first 50+ win season since the ABA days. The team swept the Hawks in the first round, before another meeting with the rival Knicks in the conference semifinals. Once again, it was up to Reggie Miller to provide some fireworks. This time, with the Pacers down six points with 16.4 seconds remaining in game one, Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to help secure the two point victory. The Pacers ultimately dispatched the Knicks in seven games and pushed the Magic to seven games before falling in the Eastern Conference Finals. =1995‚Äì1996= The Pacers duplicated their 52‚Äì30 record in 1995‚Äì96, but were hurt severely by an injury to Reggie Miller's eye socket in April, from which he was not able to return until Game 5 of their first-round series against the Hawks. Reggie scored 29 points in that game, but the Hawks came away with a two-point victory to put an early end to Indiana's season. This 1995‚Äì96 team did manage to go down in history as the only team to defeat the Chicago Bulls twice that year, a Bulls team which made history with an all-time best 72‚Äì10 record. =1996‚Äì1997= The Pacers could not withstand several key injuries in 1996‚Äì97, nor could they handle the absence of Mark Jackson, who had been traded to the Denver Nuggets before the season (though they did re-acquire Jackson at the trading deadline). The Pacers finished 39‚Äì43 and missed the playoffs for the first time in seven years, after which coach Larry Brown stepped down. =1997‚Äì1998= In the 1997‚Äì98 NBA season the Pacers selected Larry Bird to coach the team, under whom they posted a new franchise record, finishing 58-24‚Äîa dramatic 19-game improvement from the previous season. Chris Mullin joined the team in the offseason and immediately became a valuable part of the Pacers lineup‚Äîand their starting small forward. Assistant coaches Rick Carlisle, in charge of the offense, and Dick Harter, who coached the defense, were key in getting the most out of the Pacers' role players such as Dale Davis, Antonio Davis, Derrick McKey and a young Antonio Davis . Reggie Miller and Rik Smits both made the All-Star team that year, and in the playoffs, the Pacers breezed past the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks before falling to the Chicago Bulls in an epic seven-game Eastern Conference Final. =1998‚Äì2000= In the lockout-shortened 1998‚Äì99 season, the Pacers won the Central Division with a 33‚Äì17 record and swept the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers before falling to the New York Knicks in a six-game Eastern Conference Finals series. The Pacers traded popular forward Antonio Davis to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for first-round draft choice Jonathan Bender, which remains to this day a subject of controversy among Pacers fans. But in the Playoffs, after a 56‚Äì26 regular season, the Pacers survived the upset- minded Bucks in round one, handled the 76ers in the second round and finally broke through to the NBA Finals by virtue of a six-game East Finals victory over the New York Knicks. Their first NBA Finals appearance was against the Los Angeles Lakers, who proved too much for them to handle as they ended Indiana's championship hopes in six games. However, the Pacers dealt Los Angeles their worst playoff defeat up to that time by a margin of 33 points in Game Five. =2000‚Äì2001= The offseason brought sweeping changes to the Pacers' lineup, as Rik Smits and coach Larry Bird retired, Chris Mullin returned to his old Golden State Warriors team, Mark Jackson signed a long- term contract with Toronto, and Dale Davis was traded to Portland for Jermaine O'Neal, who went on to average 12.9 points per game in his first year as a starter. It was a rebuilding year for the Pacers under new head coach Isiah Thomas, but the team still managed to return to the playoffs, where they lost to the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers in four games. =2001‚Äì2002= In the midseason of 2001‚Äì02, the Pacers made a blockbuster trade with the Chicago Bulls that sent Jalen Rose and Travis Best to Chicago in exchange for Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Kevin Ollie and Ron Mercer. Brad Miller and Ron Artest would, in the next few years, go on to be All-Stars for the Pacers. The trade bolstered a team that had been floundering, and the Pacers managed to return to the playoffs, where they pushed the top-seeded New Jersey Nets to five games before losing Game 5 in double overtime. Jermaine O'Neal made his first of what would be several All-Star appearances this year, erasing any doubt that trading the veteran workhorse, Dale Davis, to Portland for him was a good idea. =2002‚Äì2003= The Pacers got off to a 13‚Äì2 start in 2002‚Äì03, but hit the wall after the All-Star break thanks in no small part to Ron Artest's multiple suspensions and family tragedies befalling Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley and Austin Croshere. O'Neal and Brad Miller both made the All-Star team and the Pacers made a substantial improvement as they finished 48‚Äì34, but they suffered a loss to the underdog Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs. =2003‚Äì2004= In the 2003 offseason, the Pacers managed to re-sign O'Neal for the NBA maximum and inked Reggie Miller to a modest two-year deal, but they could not afford to keep their talented center, Brad Miller. He was dealt to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard, who spent much of the following year watching from the bench and backing up Jeff Foster. The Pacers also signed Larry Bird as team president, and Bird wasted little time in dismissing coach Isiah Thomas and replacing him with Rick Carlisle. The Pacers swept the Boston Celtics easily in the first round, and squeezed by a scrappy Miami Heat team in the conference semifinals. But the Detroit Pistons proved an impediment to Indiana's championship aspirations, as they defeated the Pacers in six games on their way to the NBA Championship. The Pacers responded to Carlisle extremely well, and had a breakthrough 2003‚Äì04 season in which they finished 61‚Äì21, earning the best record in the NBA as well as a franchise record. O'Neal and Artest made the All-Star team, and Artest was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year. =2004‚Äì2005= Al Harrington, a small forward who had established himself as one of the best sixth-men in the NBA, was dealt in the offseason to the Atlanta Hawks in return for Stephen Jackson after Harrington allegedly demanded that the Pacers start him or trade him. Nevertheless, the Pacers started off the 2004‚Äì05 season in extremely strong fashion‚Äìuntil the infamous events of November 19, 2004. Brawl at the Palace of Auburn Hills Towards the end of a Pacers victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the Pacers' Ron Artest committed a hard foul against Ben Wallace. Wallace retaliated with a hard punch, and the situation escalated to a full-scale brawl, with fans and several Pacers taking part. While Artest defiantly laid atop the scorer's table, Piston fan John Green threw a cup of beer at Artest, causing him to charge into the stands. Stephen Jackson followed him into the stands while Jermaine O'Neal struck a fan who came onto the court. The game was called off with 46 seconds left on the clock and the Pacers left the floor amid a shower of beer and other beverages that rained down from the stands.http://www.kentucky.com/mld/heraldleader/sports/fans/10236730.htm Artest was suspended for the rest of the season without pay for his role in the fight. Several of the involved players were suspended by NBA Commissioner David Stern, but the hardest hit were Artest (suspended for the remainder of the regular season and playoffs, an NBA record 73 games), Jackson (suspended for 30 games), O'Neal (25 games), Wallace (6 games) and the Pacers' Anthony Johnson (5 games) (O'Neal's suspension was later reduced to 15 games by arbitrator Roger Kaplan, a decision that was upheld by U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels). O'Neal was charged with two counts of assault and battery, while Artest, Jackson, Johnson and David Harrison were charged with one count each. After the brawl and suspensions that followed, the Pacers fell downward into the Central Division. They went from a legitimate title contender to a team that hovered around .500 in winning percentage. The Pistons eventually became the Central Division champions. Despite the difficulties with the suspensions and injuries, the Pacers earned a sixth seed in the playoffs with a record of 44‚Äì38. An important reason for their strong finish was the re- acquisition of Dale Davis, who had been released by New Orleans after being traded there by Golden State. He played the final 25 games of the regular season and every playoff game, contributing a strong presence at center. And Davis' signing coincided with an injury to Jermaine O'Neal that would knock him out for virtually the remainder of the regular season‚Äîindeed, O'Neal's first missed game due to his injury was Davis' first game back with the Pacers. So despite the adversity they had gone through, the Pacers made the playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years. In the first round, Indiana defeated the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics in seven games, winning Game 7 in Boston by the decisive margin of 97‚Äì70. The Pacers then advanced to the second-round against the Detroit Pistons, in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference Finals. The series featured games back at The Palace of Auburn Hills, the scene of the brawl that many assumed at the time had effectively ended the Pacers' season. After losing Game 1, the Pacers won the next two games to take a 2‚Äì1 lead. However, the Pacers could not repeat their victories against the Pistons and lost the next 3 games, losing the series 4‚Äì2. The final game (Game 6) was on May 19, 2005; Reggie Miller, in his final NBA game, scored 27 points and received a huge standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Miller's effort, the Pacers lost, sending Miller into retirement without an NBA Championship in his 18-year career, all with the Pacers. Miller had his #31 jersey retired by the Pacers on March 30, 2006 when the Pacers played the Phoenix Suns. The Pacers made a major move for the 2005‚Äì06 season by signing ≈†ar≈´nas Jasikeviƒçius, the floor leader of two-time defending Euroleague champions Maccabi Tel Aviv. =Decline (2005‚Äì2010)= In 2005, the Pacers got off to an average start. On December 10, 2005, Ron Artest told a reporter for the Indianapolis Star that he wanted to be traded, saying \\"the team would be better off without me\\". Various Pacers, including Jermaine O'Neal, soon denounced him, as O'Neal did not want to talk about it. On December 12, the Pacers placed Artest on their inactive list and began seeking a trade for the troubled star. On December 16, the NBA fined Ron Artest $10,000 for publicly demanding a trade, which is similar to \\"degrading the league\\". After that, the team had gone on a 9‚Äì12 tailspin and was 22‚Äì22, a far cry from the beginning where people mentioned that the Pacers would be one of the NBA's elite. On January 24, 2006, it was said that Artest would be traded to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojakoviƒá, when the trade was declined suddenly. The following day, however, the trade was accepted, and Indiana finally cut ties with the troubled All-Star. On February 1, 2006, they managed to beat the Kobe Bryant-led Lakers, keeping the high-scorer below his average. Jermaine O'Neal was also sidelined with a torn left groin and missed two months. The Pacers finished the season 41‚Äì41. Despite the Artest saga and many key injuries the Pacers made the playoffs for the 14th time in 15 years. They also were the only road team to win Game 1 of a first-round playoff series. However, New Jersey won game 2 to tie the series at 1‚Äì1 heading back to Indiana. In game 3 Jermaine O'Neal scored 37 points as the Pacers regained a 2‚Äì1 series lead. The Nets, however, won games four and five to take a 3‚Äì2 series lead. In Game 6 Anthony Johnson scored 40 points but the Pacers' season came to an end as the Nets won 96‚Äì90. The 2006 offseason saw big changes to the Pacers roster. They drafted Shawne Williams and James White.http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/draft_060628.html Additionally on July 1, 2006 they completed a sign-and-trade with starting small forward Peja Stojakoviƒá to the New Orleans Hornets for a $100 million (sic) trade exception.http://www.sportsline.com/nba/story/9551659 The trade raised questions around the league, as Stojakovic was a free agent and did not need to be traded for. Some believe the Hornets made the trade so the Pacers could use the exception to re-acquire Al Harrington in a sign-and-trade, keeping the top free agent away from the Western Conference. On August 22 the Pacers completed the trade for Harrington and John Edwards in exchange for a future first round pick.http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/harrington_trade_060822.html In July, forward Austin Croshere was traded to the Dallas Mavericks for guard/forward Marquis Daniels.http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/trade_release_060712.html The Pacers also made another trade with the Mavericks acquiring Darrell Armstrong, Rawle Marshall, and Josh Powell in exchange for Anthony Johnson.http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nba&id;=2528599 The team lost Fred Jones and Scot Pollard via free agency, to the Toronto Raptors and the Cleveland Cavaliers, respectively. Another move saw the Pacers sign Euro League Player Maceo Bastonhttps://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AqBwsoxkFbj64IKMfGmHUgu8vLYF?slug=ap- pacersmove&prov;=ap&type;=lgns who previously teamed with former Pacer ≈†ar≈´nas Jasikeviƒçius on Israeli's premier team, Maccabi Tel Aviv. However, the \\"restoration project\\" took a major image hit when player Stephen Jackson and some teammates decided to visit a strip club on October 6, 2006. Upon leaving the club, Jackson was involved in an argument during which he was hit by a car. In response, Stephen pulled a gun out and fired off a warning shot. The Pacers finished the 2006‚Äì07 season as one of the worst seasons in team history. For the Pacers, who finished with a 35‚Äì47 records, nearly everything that could have gone wrong did. The turning point of the season would be the 11-game losing streak that started around the all-star break. Injuries to Jermaine O'Neal and Marquis Daniels, a lack of a solid back up point guard, the blockbuster trade midway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry, poor defensive efforts, and being the NBA's worst offensive team were the main reasons leading to the team's struggles. The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked the Pacers out of the playoffs for the first time since the 1996‚Äì1997 season. On January 17, 2007, the Indiana Pacers traded Al Harrington, Stephen Jackson, ≈†ar≈´nas Jasikeviƒçius, and Josh Powell to the Golden State Warriors for forward Troy Murphy, forward/guard Mike Dunleavy, Jr., forward Ike Diogu, and guard Keith McLeod. On April 25, 2007, the Indiana Pacers announced the firing of coach Rick Carlisle, with the Pacers' first losing record in ten seasons being the main reason for the coach's dismissal. Pacers President Larry Bird noted that Carlisle had the opportunity to return to the Pacers franchise in another role. Later, Carlisle opted to leave and took a broadcasting job with ESPN before returning to coach the Dallas Mavericks in 2008. On May 31, 2007, Jim O'Brien was named the head coach of the Indiana Pacers. O'Brien made it clear that he intended to take the Pacers back to the playoffs in the 2007‚Äì08 season. He also made it known that he favors a more up-tempo, fast-paced style as opposed to Carlisle's slower, more meticulous style of coaching. Despite missing the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time since the 80's, the 2007‚Äì08 season displayed many signs of growth in the team, especially towards the end of the season. Off- court legal distraction from Jamaal Tinsley, Marquis Daniels, and Shawne Williams in the middle of the season did not help the Pacers struggles, and injuries to Tinsley and Jermaine O'Neal damaged the Pacers' already weak defense and left almost all point guard duties to recently acquired Travis Diener, who saw minimal minutes on his previous NBA teams. Despite this, and a 36‚Äì46 record, the Pacers had a very strong finish to the season, which included a desperate attempt to steal the 8th seed from the Atlanta Hawks, and dramatic improvement in forwards Danny Granger and Mike Dunleavy. Both Granger and Dunleavy were involved in the voting for Most Improved Player, with Dunleavy finishing in the top 10. The two were also the first Pacer pair to score 1500 points each in a single season since Reggie Miller and Detlef Schrempf did it in the early 90s. In April of the 2007‚Äì08 Season, Donnie Walsh, Pacers Sports & Entertainment CEO & President, left the Indiana Pacers to join the New York Knicks. All of Walsh's basketball-related duties were given to Pacers' President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird. Walsh's business-related roles were given to co-owner Herbert Simon and Jim Morris, who was promoted to President of Pacers Sports & Entertainment. On July 9, 2008, the Pacers traded Jermaine O'Neal and the rights to Nathan Jawai to the Toronto Raptors for T.J. Ford, Rasho Nesterovic, Maceo Baston, and the rights to Roy Hibbert. On the same day the Pacers acquired Jarrett Jack, Josh McRoberts, and the rights to Brandon Rush from the Portland Trail Blazers in return for Ike Diogu and the rights to Jerryd Bayless. On October 10, 2008, the Pacers traded Shawne Williams to the Dallas Mavericks for Eddie Jones and two future second-round draft picks. In the 2009 NBA draft, the Pacers drafted F Tyler Hansbrough out of the University of North Carolina and G A.J. Price from the University of Connecticut. The Pacers also signed veterans in G Dahntay Jones to a four-year deal, F Solomon Jones to a two-year deal, and PG Earl Watson to a one-year deal. Each of those players were brought in because of their defensive abilities, something that the Pacers have lacked in past seasons. They were 5th-worst in the NBA during the 2008‚Äì09 season in points allowed. The Pacers also completed the buyout of troubled PG Jamaal Tinsley. The Toronto Raptors signed former Pacers Jarrett Jack and Rasho Nesterovic. On September 16, 2009, co-owner Melvin Simon died at the age of 82. In his honor, the Pacers wore \\"Mel\\" patches for the 2009‚Äì10 season. During the 2009‚Äì2010 season, Pacers F Tyler Hansbrough suffered a season-ending ear injury and without C Jeff Foster, the Pacers again fell into another season under .500 and missed the playoffs for 4 years in a row. Despite another disappointing season, the Pacers managed to sweep the waning Detroit Pistons for the first time in 5 years, and the abysmal New Jersey Nets for the first time in 20. The team showed signs of life near the end of the season, winning nearly all of their last 14 games. 2010‚Äìpresent: Danny Granger and a new era =2010 offseason= In May 2010, after completing his rookie season, guard A. J. Price suffered a knee injury during a charity pick-up game that would require surgery. His expected rehabilitation was to last between 4‚Äì6 months, to be back just in time for training camp. The 2010 NBA Draft brought in five new faces for the Pacers. Guard Paul George out of the Fresno State University in the first round and guard Lance Stephenson from the University of Cincinnati in the second round. The Pacers also selected forward Ryan Reid from the Florida State University. The draft rights to Reid were traded on draft night to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange to the rights to forward/center Magnum Rolle from Louisiana Tech. The Pacers signed Paul George to his rookie contract on July 1, 2010. Lance Stephenson signed a multi-year contract with the team on July 22. 2010. Just before training camp, Rolle was signed, along with big man Lance Allred. On August 11, 2010, the Pacers acquired guard Darren Collison and swingman James Posey from the New Orleans Hornets in a four-team, five-player deal. Troy Murphy was dealt to the New Jersey Nets within that trade. The gain of Collison has been a sign that the Pacers' starting point guard dilemma has been solved for many years to come. Off-the- court issues involving rookie Lance Stephenson (allegations of pushing his current girlfriend down a flight of stairs after an argument.) and current Pacers guard Brandon Rush (Suspended for five games by failing NBA drug policy for testing positive for marijuana for the third time) put a damper on the effects of the four-team trade earlier in the summer. =2010‚Äì2011= Adding to the already young core of Danny Granger and Roy Hibbert, the newly acquired Darren Collison added what will hopefully be the team's first stable point guard since Mark Jackson from the early 2000s. In the 2010‚Äì2011 season, the team went 2-3 in the first five games. On November 9 in a home game against Denver, the team scored 54 points in the 3rd quarter alone, shooting 20-21 in the process, on the way to a 144-113 rout of the Nuggets. Led by Mike Dunleavy's 24 points in the period, the team set a franchise record for most points in a quarter and was only four points short of the all-time NBA record for points in a quarter (58) set in the 1970s. =2012‚Äì2013= The Pacers, led by Paul George, almost beat the Miami Heat during the conference finals, losing by one game. Key contributors during the series included George, Roy Hibbert, and David West. =2013‚Äì2014: The rise of an MVP candidate= Pacers has now won the first place in its section, followed up by Miami Heat. It holds the record of 20 wins and 3 lost games. Paul George, one of the key players in Pacers had shown a significant improvement and had contributed to his team. = 2014‚Äì2015: Georgeless = Prior to the commencement of the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season, Pacers' star guard Paul George suffered a severe leg- break, which severely dented their title aspirations. The Pacers finished 9th in the Eastern Conference missing out on the playoffs for the first time in 4 seasons. = 2015‚Äì16: The return of Paul George = A fully fit Paul George spearheaded Indiana's run to the 7th seed in the Eastern Conference. Acquisition Monta Ellis as well as rookie Myles Turner were impressive in their inaugural seasons for the Pacers. Paul George had arguably his most consistent post-season, in which he averaged 27.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game as well as career high playoff shooting percentages in all categories. The Pacers fell in 7 against the Toronto Raptors, following the first round exit coach Frank Vogel's contract was not extended, Bird cited a possible issue of complacency as the reasoning behind his decision. =Nate McMillan and Victor Oladipo era= After days of speculation it was announced that Pacers' assistant coach Nate McMillan would be Head Coach for the 2016/17 NBA season. Before the 2017-18 NBA season, The Pacers sent Paul George to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis References Indiana Pacers History of Indianapolis National Basketball Association history by team ","title":"History of the Indiana Pacers"},{"id":"30192427","text":"Frank Wilson Wozencraft (June 7, 1892 ‚Äì September 3, 1966), attorney and civic leader, was mayor of Dallas from 1917 to 1921.

Chovanec is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) registered in the State of Illinois.  Writings and commentary  = China's real estate market = Chovanec was among the early commentators to highlight the threat of a bubble forming in China's real estate market in the wake of the global financial crisis. In an article in the June 2009 issue of Far Eastern Economic Review, he introduced the idea that Chinese savers have been stockpiling multiple residential units, and willingly leaving them vacant, as a \\"store of value,\\" like gold.China's Real Estate Riddle, Far Eastern Economic Review, June 2009 He identified three main reasons for this behavior: (1) the lack of attractive investment alternatives, given China's closed capital account, (2) a limited track record, given that China had never seen a sustained downturn in real estate since converting to private home ownership in the 1990s, and (3) minimal holding costs, in particular the absence of an annual property holding tax. Chovanec argues that, despite strong housing demand from rising incomes and urbanization in China, these factors have distorted the market and created a persistent but ultimately unsustainable overhang in high-end housing. He further argues that China's state-inspired lending boom, in response to the global financial crisis, has created a more classic leveraged bubble in commercial real estate.Chinalogue: Real Estate Bubble in China?, aired on Blue Ocean Network, January 2010 Chovanec contends that while the systemic risk may look substantially different from the conditions that spawned the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, Chinese banks nevertheless have significant exposure to the property market, due to the widespread practice of lending to businesses on the basis of inflated land values as collateral.Leverage and China's Property Market, Seeking Alpha, January 7, 2010 In late 2011, in Foreign Affairs magazine, Chovanec called attention to the downturn in China property prices and transaction volumes, suggesting that the \\"bubble\\" may have popped.China's Real Estate Bubble May Have Popped, Foreign Affairs, December 18, 2011 He has since argued that lifting the central government's restrictions on multiple home purchases, along with a renewed push to construct subsidized public housing, would not‚Äîas is commonly hoped‚Äîbe sufficient to turn the market around in the face of what Chovanec sees as a more fundamental correction.Economist: No Silver Bullets for China Property Market, Wall Street Journal, March 20, 2012 = China's post-crisis economic stimulus = Chovanec has been consistently critical of China's stimulus package in response to the global financial crisis, although he admits that China's leaders may have felt they had little alternative at the onset of the crisis. He has stated that the challenge China faces is not quantity of GDP, but quality of GDP (economic investments that would position China for sustainable future growth), and has questioned the economic utility of many of the state-led projects designed to boost China's near-term GDP to achieve the government's target of 8%.China's Economy: All GDP Is Not Created Equal, Seeking Alpha, October 26, 2009 Beginning in May 2009, he wrote that the ongoing lending boom by Chinese state-run banks could burden them with sizeable bad debt, as well as reverse a decade's worth of reforms intended to transform those banks into genuine commercial entities.Undoing Chinese Bank Reform, Wall Street Journal, May 7, 2009 He also contends that the lending boom, by expanding China's money supply more than 50% over the past two years, has created massive inflationary pressure in the Chinese economy, despite low reported increases in CPI.China Hides Rampant Inflation in Money Binge: Patrick Chovanec, Bloomberg, October 20, 2010 Chovanec reconciles the apparent discrepancy by arguing that China's monetary expansion has been channeled into asset inflation, including real estate, gold, jade, and other tangible forms of savings, and is only gradually working its way into more general price inflation. He argues that, unless China's economy is quickly weaned from its dependence on \\"easy credit and cheap money,\\" rising inflation will force Chinese authorities to cut off liquidity, causing a hard landing. Chovanec has been equally critical of China's growing tendency, in the wake of the crisis, to favor active state intervention and state-owned enterprises at the expense of continued market opening and private enterprise‚Äîa trend summed up in the Chinese expression \\"guo jin min tui\\" (ÂõΩËøõÊ∞ëÈÄÄ), or \\"the state advances, the private sector retreats.\\"Guo Jin Min Tui - The State Advances, The Private Sector Retreats, Seeking Alpha, August 31, 2010 In October 2010, Chovanec wrote that China's leaders need to stage an encore of Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour, in order to recommit the country to the path of market reform, after a similar period of retrenchment.Step In, Then Step Back , China Economic Review, October 2010 = China's currency and exchange rate regime = Chovanec argues that it is in China's own interests to move towards a more flexible exchange rate and a stronger Renminbi. Such a move, he believes, would reduce inflationary pressures on China's economy and enhance the buying power, and hence the living standards, of average Chinese citizens, as well as reducing tensions with China's trading partners. However, he sharply disagrees with Paul Krugman, and argues that an exclusive focus on rectifying exchange rates as a \\"silver bullet\\" is misplaced. Forcing China to strengthen its currency against its will, he contends, would only cause China to shore up its export sector through other means, and would likely result in a replay of the 1985 Plaza Accord (in which the value of the Japanese yen doubled, yet had virtually no impact on the US-Japan trade imbalance due to structural reasons). Exchange rate reform, Chovanec believes, will only have the desired impact if it is part of a broader economic strategy in which China embraces greater market reform and opening.Currency Concerns Are Misplaced , China Brief, September 2010 = The Nine Nations of China = In November 2009, Chovanec authored an interactive map-based article in the online version of The Atlantic, titled \\"The Nine Nations of China\\", in which he wrote the China can be considered not as a monolithic entity of 1.3 billion people, but as a mosaic of nine distinct regions, each with its own history, character, and dynamics shaping its future.\\"The Nine Nations of China\\", The Atlantic, November 2009 He pointed out that, if each of these regions were actually a separate country, they would account for eight of the 20 most populous nations in the world. Chovanec says his framework was largely inspired by Joel Garreau's 1981 book The Nine Nations of North America. Chovanec noted that while he later became aware that several previous scholars, such as G. William Skinner, had proposed similar regional breakdowns of China, his own \\"Nine Nations\\" framework and the regional descriptions that support it are original, based on his private equity investment experiences in China and his travels to every one of China's 31 provinces over the past 25 years. Chovanec has proposed that the \\"Nine Nations\\" could provide a valuable framework for conducting market research, economic analysis, and other practical applications.Investing in China: Why the Nine Nations Matter, Seeking Alpha, November 25, 2009 = North Korea = Chovanec is one of just over a thousand U.S. citizens to have been permitted to visit North Korea.

He helped the Rev. James Stuart or Stewart of Killin to translate the New Testament into Scottish Gaelic.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Richard D. Jackson, ‚ÄòBuchanan, Dugald (1716‚Äì1768)‚Äô, first published 2004, 933 words John Reid called him \\"the Cowper of the Highlands\\". Background Kinloch Rannoch. The church is All Saints Scottish Episcopal Church. The obelisk is not a war memorial, but is inscribed: \\"In memory of Dugald Buchanan the Rannoch schoolmaster, evangelist and sacred poet, died 24th June 1768\\". The memorial is dated 1875. Rannoch's clans had played a full part in the Jacobite uprisings. All those the troops believed to be rebels were killed, as were some non-combatants, 'rebellious' settlements were burned and livestock was confiscated on a large scale. Some in the highland Jacobite regions survived the ravaging of the countryside by King George's forces only to starve the following winter. When the reprisals ceased, the warriors returned. However, without crops or cattle, there seemed no alternative open to them but thieving, and sheer hunger drove them to commit savage deeds. A Captain Patton of Guise‚Äôs Regiment said ‚Äôthe people of this country (Rannoch) are the greatest thieves in Scotland and were all in the late rebellion, except for a few. They have a great number of arms but they keep them concealed from us.‚Äô Though traumatised by the violent history of the times in which he lived, his passions ultimately turned to the spiritual and the poetic, as L. Macbean commented: 'Though Buchanan himself had not espoused the Jacobite cause, this cold-bloodcd massacre of his friends roused the old Highlander in him, and for a time not even his new-found religion could banish wild thoughts of revenge from his mind. However, after a mental conflict that continued for years, the genius of Christianity at last prevailed, and he learned to forgive.' (L. Macbean, \\"Sketch of the Author's Life\\" in Dugald Buchanan's Spiritual Songs, Edinburgh, 1884). Life Dugald Buchanan was a teacher and an evangelist, preaching at large open air meetings, which upwards of 500 people attended. He showed great courage as he persuaded the 'wild men' of Rannoch to give up their lawlessness and savage ways. He and his wife taught them new trades and crafts. They worked with James Small, formerly an Ensign in Lord Loudoun‚Äôs Regiment, who had been appointed by the Commissioners for the Forfeited Estates to run the Rannoch estates which had been seized from the clan chieftains who had supported the Jacobites. The tiny hamlet at the east end of Loch Rannoch, now known as Kinloch Rannoch, was enlarged and settled, mainly by soldiers being discharged from the army, but also by displaced crofters. A wide range of agricultural and other improvement works were undertaken across the estates, including drainage, road making and bridge building. Slowly peace and prosperity were brought to Rannoch. Flax and potatoes were introduced, mills built and spinning and weaving taught; a mason, joiner and wheelwright passed on their skills; a shoemaker and a tailor set up business. Dugald Buchanan is buried in the Little Leny, Buchanan Burial Enclosure and Burial Ground near Callander, Stirling, Scotland, at the confluence of the Eas Gobhain and Garbh Uisge rivers. Work Buchanan was a highly regarded religious poet who, strongly influenced by his reading of English Puritan writings, composed his celebrated Spiritual Hymns in a Scots Gaelic of a high quality that to some extent reflected the language of the classical Gaelic common to the bards of both Ireland and Scotland. Buchanan and minister James Stuart of Killin, sponsored by the SSPCK (Scottish Society for Promotion of Christian Knowledge), carried out the first translation of the New Testament into Gaelic. Their translation, begun in 1755, was completed and published in 1767. Following the unsuccessful Jacobite rebellion of 1745, the Gaelic language had been proscribed, and all schools in the Highlands were required to teach only in English. Buchanan and Stuart's translation was significant in that it was accompanied by a shift by the SSPCK and other educational authorities back to Gaelic as the language of education of Highland Scottish children. This played a major part in promoting literacy in the language. Buchanan also translated some English Puritan literature into Gaelic. Buchanan was considerably impressed by James Macpherson‚Äôs Ossian (1760-65) and, taking it to be authentic, was moved to revalue the genuine traditions and rich cultural heritage of the Gaels. At around the same time, he wrote to Sir James Clerk of Penicuik, the leading antiquary of the movement, proposing that someone should travel to the Isles and Western Coast of Scotland and collect the work of the ancient and modern bards, in which alone he could find the language in its purity. Much later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, this task was taken up by collectors such as Alexander CarmichaelCarmina Gadelica, Alexander Carmichael, printed by T. & A. Constable, Edinburgh, 1900. and Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray,Tales from Highland Perthshire, collected by Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray, translated and edited by Sylvia Robertson and Tony Dilworth, Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, Volume 20, 2009. and to be recorded and continued by the work of the School of Scottish Studies and the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society. Memorial Buchanan is commemorated by a monument erected in The Square at Kinloch Rannoch and by the first church built at the Braes of Rannoch, or Georgetown as it was known at the time, named after King George.

The discovery was made using the automated asteroids discovery program CoLiTec. At the time of discovery, the comet had an apparent magnitude of 19.5, making it about 150,000 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye.Math: (sqrt[5]{100})^{19.5-6.5}approx 158489 The discoverer, Leonid Elenin, originally estimated that the comet nucleus was 3‚Äì4 km in diameter, but more recent estimates place the pre-breakup size of the comet at 2 km. (Backup link) Comet Elenin started disintegrating in August 2011, and as of mid-October 2011 was not visible even using large ground-based telescopes. Brightness In April 2011, the comet was around magnitude 15 (roughly the brightness of Pluto), with a coma (expanding tenuous dust atmosphere) estimated to be about 80,000 km in diameter. the coma had exceeded 100,000 km, and it had exceeded 200,000 km. Estimates of the comet's visual brightness varied from 13.1 to 13.8 magnitude between May 22 and June 4, were approaching 10 by late July 2011, and were around 8.3 as of mid August 2011. Even at a magnitude of 8.3, the comet was about 5 times fainter than the naked eye can see under a completely dark sky.Math: 2.512(8.3 ‚àí 6.5) = 5.2 On 19 August 2011 comet Elenin was hit by a coronal mass ejection (CME). The comet started disintegrating, as did comet C/1999 S4. As of mid September 2011 the comet had become dimmer than magnitude 10.5, and appeared around magnitude 12 as seen by STEREO-A. (STEREO-A image) the comet is projected to be about magnitude 14 and fading. By mid-October 2011 there had been no confirmed ground based sighting of Comet Elenin even using the Faulkes Telescope North with a limiting magnitude of around 20.5. (Oct 17 failed recovery) (Oct 21 attempt) The dust cloud remnants of Comet Elenin started to become visible to ground-based telescopes around 21 October 2011. The post-disintegration appearance of C/2010 X1 has been visually compared to the debris field of Shoemaker-Levy 9 as seen on 23 June 1993. Between August 1 and August 12 of 2011, NASA repeatedly rolled the STEREO-B spacecraft to view the forward scattering of light as the spacecraft, comet, and Sun aligned. (Aug 6th to Aug 12th animation) , Comet Elenin was visible in STEREO-B without rolling the craft. Because it disintegrated, SOHO failed to detect the forward scattering of light in late September. Because the orbit of Elenin is nearly coincident with the ecliptic plane with an inclination of only 1.84¬∞, the comet entered forward-scattering geometry from STEREO-B, SOHO, and Earth. Had the comet not disintegrated, it would have allowed the dust scattering function to be studied simultaneously from two different locations. C/2010 X1 made its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on 10 September 2011 at a distance of . The remnant of Elenin made its closest approach to Earth on 16 October 2011, at a distance of or slightly closer than the planet Venus, at a relative velocity of 86,000 km/h. Before the August fading of the comet, the Minor Planet Center ephemeris projected that the originally bright comet Elenin would reach about 6th magnitude in September and October 2011, (C/2010 X1) but the brightness depends on the activity level of the coma. But because Elenin disintegrated, it did not become visible to the naked eye or binoculars. Elenin made its closest apparent pass in the night sky to Comet 45P/Honda‚ÄìMrkos‚ÄìPajdu≈°√°kov√° on the morning of October 8, and moved apparently close to Mars on October 15. The comet came to opposition at 178¬∞ from the Sun on March 14, 2011 and came to opposition again on November 22, 2011 at 175¬∞ from the Sun. The minimum angle between the Sun and comet occurred on September 26 (1.9¬∞), and between July 28 and October 10 the comet was less than 45 degrees from the Sun. Original and future orbit Given the orbital eccentricity of this object, its orbital period is not a fixed value, because it is frequently perturbed by the gravity of the planets. Near perihelion, using an August 2011 epoch, Kazuo Kinoshita shows C/2010 X1 to have a heliocentric orbital period of 600,000 years, though more perturbations will occur. For objects at such high eccentricity, the Sun's barycentric coordinates are more stable than heliocentric coordinates. The orbit of a long-period comet is properly obtained when the osculating orbit is computed at an epoch after leaving the planetary region and is calculated with respect to the center of mass of the Solar System. Using JPL Horizons with an observed orbital arc of 271 days, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2500 generate a hyperbolic orbit with an eccentricity of 1.0004. (Solution using the Solar System Barycenter and barycentric coordinates. Select Ephemeris Type:Elements and Center:@0) (saved Horizons output file 2011-Aug-08) Before entering the planetary region (epoch 1600), Elenin had a calculated barycentric orbital period of tens of millions of years with an apoapsis (aphelion) distance of about . Elenin was probably in the outer Oort cloud with a loosely bound chaotic orbit that was easily perturbed by passing stars. hyperbolic orbit and after perihelion is perturbed into an elliptical orbit that is bound to the Sun.

History The former IMAX Theatre at Dreamworld. =IMAX Theatre= The IMAX Theatre was a movie theatre which opened with Dreamworld on 15 December 1981 that showed IMAX films. The theatre showcased one film, several times throughout a normal operating day. The park rotated the films in which they display. Films included Australia: Land Beyond Time, India: Kingdom of the Tiger, Space Station, Super Speedway and To Fly (the opening day film). =Dreamworld Cinema= In preparation for Dreamworld's 30th Birthday celebrations, the park closed the IMAX Theatre on 22 November 2010. During the short period it was closed, the park renovated the theatre to turn it into the Dreamworld Cinema. Dreamworld replaced all of the 315 seats and invested in a new high-tech digital projection system capable of showing RealD Cinema films in 3D on the 21x11 metre (69x36 foot) screen. The Dreamworld Cinema was officially opened on 6 January 2011. Less than a year after opening, cinema operations were ceased with the theatre continuing to offer a free movie during normal park operating hours. Architectural design In 1974, John Longhurst purchased of land at Coomera in order to construct the Dreamworld theme park. Although a lot of the initial work was done by himself, Longhurst spared no expense when he employed designers from Disneyland (in Anaheim, California) and Walt Disney World (in Florida) to design Main Street. The IMAX Theatre's building is modelled after the Emporium at Disney parks. Cinema The Dreamworld Cinema building is located on ground level in Main Street. Guests enter the top of the cinema via a foyer area. The cinema seating steps down under ground level. This allows the large 21x11 metre (69x36 foot) screen to be concealed in the relatively smaller building. At opening, the theatre showcased three films. The first, The Curse of Skull Rock, was shown several times throughout a normal operating day and was included in the normal admission. Other films included Tron: Legacy and Megamind which were not included in general admission and were shown after Dreamworld closed.  Sky Voyager  On 27 December 2017 Dreamworld announced that it had entered into a partnership with Brogent Technologies Inc to bring the Southern Hemisphere's very first Flying Theatre Experience to the park - replacing the Dreamworld Cinema attraction. The Dreamworld Cinema officially closed to guests in early February 2018 to make way for construction of the new attraction which is believed to be opening for the summer season. It was revealed in December 2018 that it was set to be called Sky Voyager, a simulator ride centred around soaring over Australia.https://www.dreamworld.com.au/rides/family-rides/sky-voyager It opened in August 2019.

The key contracts managed by the office were: * Trains in Melbourne (contract with Metro Trains Melbourne)- these services covered the provision of suburban rail services in Melbourne * Trams in Melbourne (with Keolis Downer) - these services covered the provision of suburban tram and light rail services in Melbourne * Trains in regional Victoria (with V/Line Corporation) - these services covered the provision of train services in country and regional Victoria * Bus services in Melbourne and the rest of Victoria, including school bus services, with a large number of different bus operators. Train and tram services in Victoria are governed by complex statutory, government and commercial relationships. VicTrack is the custodian of all rail infrastructure and assets in Victoria. VicTrack leased these to the Director of Public Transport through the Metropolitan Infrastructure Head Lease. The Director then sub-leased the assets to the metropolitan train and tram operators through Infrastructure Leases. The Director managed the rights and obligations contained in these leases on behalf of the State. The Director also entered into franchise agreements with the metropolitan train and tram operators that governed the provision of public transport passenger services. The franchise agreements specified a range of operational and service requirements administered and managed by the Director. In relation to regional train services operated by V/Line Corporation, similar arrangements were entered into with VicTrack and the Director. VicTrack leased the regional train infrastructure and assets to the Director, who then sub-leased these assets to V/Line under the Regional Infrastructure Lease. Similarly, the Director and V/Line entered into a franchise agreement which governed the operational and service requirements for regional train services. Taxis and trams in Melbourne. Taxis in Victoria were regulated by the Victorian Taxi Directorate, a business unit previously located in the office of the Director of Public Transport. = Taxis and hire cars = The Director of Public Transport was the regulator of taxi and hire car services in Victoria.See Part 6, Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983.

The office of the Director, again through the VTD, was also responsible for the accreditation of commercial passenger vehicle drivers including taxi drivers.Drivers of taxis, hire cars and buses. This was provided in Part 6 of the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 . The responsibilities were later conferred by delegation on the VTD from the Secretary of the Department of Transport but have been overseen by the Taxi Services Commission as of 1 July 2013. = Other responsibilities = The Director was also charged with the accreditation of passenger transport companies for enforcement purposes, and the appointment and management of authorised officers for enforcement across the public transport system.See Part 7, Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983.

This Act effectively privatised those aspects of the operation of public transport in Victoria which were not already provided directly by private companies. On 24 August 1999, the Director effectively took over responsibility for public transport in Victoria from the former Public Transport Corporation, which had been a statutory authority responsible for operating a large proportion of Victoria's public transport services. The Rail Corporations (Further Amendment) Act inserted provisionsSee former subdivision 2 of Part II of the former Transport Act 1983. into the then Transport Act 1983This Act was renamed from 1 July 2010 the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983 by the Transport Integration Act 2010. to create the office and its functions and powers.

Background The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) had suffered from a large backlog of cases due to a low number of physicians. In early 2010, the Board of Medicolegal Investigations, which is the governing body of OCME, placed Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Collie Trant, M.D., on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons. Within days, the Board terminated Dr. Trant. Soon after Dr. Trants' termination, Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry directed State Health Commissioner Terry Cline to review the operations of OCEM and make a report recommending both operational and statutory changes. In late March, Commissioner Cline released his report on OCME. In his report, Cline recommended both greater oversight authority on the part of the Medicolegal Investigations Board as well as restructuring the organization of OCME. Cline outline three models for possible reorganization but recommended the model that made the most sweeping changes. Under currently State law, the Chief Medical Examiner, who must be a licensed physician, is the executive head of OCME, responsible for all operations and administration of the agency. Cline recommended that State law be changed to establish a non-physician Administrator as head of OCME who would be responsible for all agency operations, with the position of Chief Medical Examiner overseeing all medical operations and reporting to the Administrator. Cline pointed to the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Oklahoma State Department of Health as examples of this model. Following the release of Cline's report, President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate Glenn Coffee and Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives Chris Benge proposed Senate Bill 738 which would have enacted many of Cline's recommendations, including the establishment of a Transition Coordinator. The Transition Cooridnator, as provided by SB738, was to oversee the transition of OCME from its current location in Oklahoma City to Edmond and received an annual salary of $80,000. SB738 passed the Senate 45-0 and passed House of Representatives 58-40. Immediately following the passage of SB738, Democratic State Senator Debbe Leftwich announced that she would not seek reelection. On the same day, Republican State Representative Mike Christian announced that he would seek Leftwich's seat. Citing legislative misconduct, Governor Henry vetoed SB738 on June 6 after being briefed by Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater on his ongoing investigation over political corruption involving that bill. Days later, DA Prater announced that he had launched a political corruption investigation of State Representative Randy Terrill (R-Moore), State Senator Leftwich and State Representative Christian over allegations that those legislators conspired to use SB738 to create a state job specifically for Senator Leftwich in OCME in exchange for her agreeing not to seek re-election. This, according to allegations, would make way for Representative Christian to fill her vacant Senate seat.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Currently, no Masonic lodge meets in the building History Port Sanilac was first settled in about 1840. In 1852, the first sawmill was established, and by 1866 Port Sanilac was a thriving village. Local Masons were meeting as early 1866, and in 1868, Sanilac Lodge No. 237 was organized with fifteen members. The Lodge met in rented quarters, and likely continued to do so through the early 1880s. In 1883, the Masons first began discussing the construction of a new Lodge building, and considered proposing a cooperative arrangement with the township that would let both parties share a single building. A member of the organization donated the land, and the Masons came to an agreement where the township would construct the foundation, and the Masons would construct the remainder of the building. In early 1884, the Masons began advertising for bids for construction, and the cornerstone was dedicated in July. Construction was completed by July 1885. Description The Port Sanilac Masonic and Town Hall is a rectangular, two-story red-orange brick building on a fieldstone foundation. It has a front gable roof, hidden by a false front topped with an iron cornice. The main facade is divided into four bays by vertical brick piers. The bays have a broad, round-head sections, two of which have windows, and two of which have double doors. One set of doors leads to the first floor township offices, and the second to the upstairs Masonic lodge. The second floor facade has segmental-arch-head windows with slightly projecting two- course high brick hoods, with the original windows being two-over-two units. Dark brown bricks accent the second story of the facade.

Life Armstrong was born, on 8 May 1784, at Ayres Quay, near Bishop Wearmouth, County Durham, where his father, George Armstrong, of humble birth, was a superintendent of glass works. He was educated privately, and then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.D. in 1807 with a dissertation, De Causis Morborum Hydropicorum. He practised in Sunderland, and was physician to the Sunderland Infirmary. In 1818 he moved to London, and in 1819 he was appointed physician to the London Fever Institution, a post which he resigned in 1824; and in 1820 became licentiate of the College of Physicians. Armstrong acquired a practice and also became a popular teacher of medicine. In 1821 he joined Edward Grainger, a teacher of anatomy, as lecturer on medicine at the school then being founded by the latter in Webb Street, a significant institution of the time. In 1826 he joined James Risdon Bennett in founding another school in Little Dean Street, Soho, and for some time lectured in both places. In 1828, failing health compelled Armstrong to give up teaching, and he died of consumption on 12 December 1829, at the age of 45. Works While at Sunderland, Armstrong published, besides several memoirs in the Edinburgh Medical Journal, Facts and Observations relative to the Fever commonly called Puerperal (London, 1814), and Practical Illustrations of Typhus and other Febrile Diseases (London, 1816), by which he became known to the medical profession. He published Practical Illustrations of the Scarlet Fever, Measles, Pulmonary Consumption (London, 1818), which added to his reputation. Popular at the time, and based on his own observations, they became obsolete shortly. Armstrong's own views changed in relation to typhus, which he in his earlier works asserted to be contagious, but in his later memoirs (The Lancet, 1825) attributed to a malarial origin. In treatment Armstrong was an ardent advocate of the antiphlogistic system, and made a copious use of bleeding. Armstrong wrote also: * An Address to the Members of the Royal College of Surgeons on the injurious conduct and defective state of that Corporation with reference to Professional Rights, Medical Science, and the Public Health, London, 1825. His controversy with the Royal College of Surgeons arose out of an attempt by the College to discourage private medical teaching by refusing to accept certificates except from the recognised hospitals and their medical schools. With the Royal College of Physicians he was at odds, too, having been rejected when he first presented himself as a candidate for the licentiateship. * The Morbid Anatomy of the Stomach, Bowels, and Liver, illustrated by a series of plates with explanatory letterpress, and a summary of the symptoms of the acute and chronic affections of the above-named organs, London, (unfinished). * Lectures on the Morbid Anatomy, Nature, and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Diseases, edited by Joseph Rix (after the author's death), London, 1834. Family In 1811 he married Sarah, daughter of Charles Spearman, by whom he left a family, including a son John, who became bishop of Grahamstown.

It serves as the rear light of the Goods Island Range, pointing out the entrance to Normanby Sound. History The first navigation aid on Goods Island was a signalling station, established in 1877. In 1882 pearl fishers operating in Torres Strait requested that a light be established at the western entrance to the straight. Their request was accepted by George Heath, chairman of the Queensland Marine Board, who dictated the location of Goods Island. A temporary light installed on the signalman's quarters was finally replaced by the lighthouse, constructed in 1886. It was the third in a group of eight lighthouses in Queensland made of hardwood frame clad with corrugated iron, which includes, in order of establishment Little Sea Hill Light, Grassy Hill Light, itself, Bay Rock Light, Old Caloundra Light, North Point Hummock Light (demolished), Gatcombe Head Light (demolished) and Bulwer Island Light. The lighthouse was constructed entirely by government workers, rather than a private contractor, and it is believed to be unique in this sense among Queensland lighthouses. The original apparatus was a fourth order dioptric with a totally reflecting glass mirror. In 1894 telegraphic communication with Thursday Island was established. Following the Federation of Australia, the station was transferred to the hands of the Commonwealth of Australia. Goods Island Light, ca. 1909 During World War II the island was taken over by the Royal Australian Navy which constructed defensive batteries around the island. In 1973 the lighthouse was automated. In 1988 it was transferred to solar power. Structure The lighthouse is about high. It is conical in shape, made of hardwood frame clad with white painted corrugated iron. It is topped by a red zinc done. Access to the tower is through concrete steps and a small corrugated iron entryway with a convex corrugated iron roof. Also part of the station is the front light, a white hut on a rock platform below. The lighthouse is located 505 meters at 199¬∞ from this front light. Also in the premises are a timber storage shed a timber fibro-cement clad lighthouse keeper's cottage, now in ruins. Both of them are white with green painted galvanized iron roofs.

Title 1 comprises one volume, further divided into four chapters. As of the revision of January 1, 2012, the Title includes regulations on the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register (1 CFR Parts 1-22) and the Office of the Federal Register (1 CFR Parts 51), which are responsible for preparing the Federal Register and associated publications, including the Code of Federal Regulations. The Title also codifies regulations for the Administrative Conference of the United States (1 CFR Parts 300-04), the President's Commission on White House Fellowships (1 CFR 425), the National Capital Planning Commission (1 CFR 455-457), and the National Commission for Employment Policy (1 CFR 500). Chapter summaries =Chapter 1: Administrative Committee of the Federal Register= Chapter 1 states that, in addition to setting forth the policies, procedures, and delegations under which the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register carries out its general responsibilities under chapter 15 of title 44 of the United States Code, its purpose is \\"to inform the public of the nature and uses of Federal Register publications.\\" The Administrative Committee of the Federal Register as established by section 1506 of title 44 of the United States Code consists of: # The Archivist, or Acting Archivist, of the United States, who is the Chairman; # An officer of the Department of Justice designated by the Attorney General; and, # The Public Printer or Acting Public Printer. The Director of the Federal Register is the Secretary of the Committee.1 C.F.R. 2.2 as of 2012 The Director of the Federal Register is responsible for ensuring the filing of Acts of Congress, Presidential proclamations, and other documents published by the Executive Branch. Acts of Congress are published individually as slip laws, compiled as the United States Statutes at Large, while Executive Branch documents are published daily in the Federal Register and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. Anyone may reuse or republish material within the Federal Register without restriction. Staff of the Office of the Federal Register may provide information about published documents, but may not substantively interpret them. Documents filed with the Office of the Federal Register are made available for public inspection at their Washington, D.C. office during business hours, and can be photocopied with the appropriate payment of fees. Subchapter B (1 CFR 1.5-1.6) governs the publication of the Federal Register, including the different categories of documents (presidential proclamations, rules and regulations, proposed rules, and notices), how it is to be published, and what shall and shall not be published within the Federal Register. It also includes information on supplementary documents to be published. Subchapter C requires the publication of \\"special editions\\" of the Federal Register. These special editions include the compact Code of Federal Regulations, the United States Government Manual, and the Daily Publication of Presidential Documents. Subchapter D describes the processes for obtaining subscriptions to the Federal Register and associated publications, as well as providing for distribution of these publications within the federal government. Subchapter E governs the specifications for documents to be included in the Federal Register, as well as the processes for preparing them and including them in the Federal Register. =Chapter 2: Office of the Federal Register= Chapter 2 (1 CFR 51) concerns the incorporation by reference of outside documents into the Federal Register, thereby making them a part of the Federal Register. Regulations include the circumstances under which the Director of the Federal Register will approve incorporation, how to request approval, which publications are eligible, the proper language for citing incorporated publications, and how to change or remove incorporations. =Chapter 3: Administrative Conference of the United States= Chapter 3 (1 CFR 300-399) addresses the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), an independent agency established by the Administrative Conference Act. The CFR states that the purposes of the ACUS are to facilitate cooperation between the federal government and the general public to ensure that regulations are most effective and infringe on private rights the least. The ACUS also exists to \\"improve the use of science\\" and \\"reduce unnecessary litigation\\" in the regulatory process. The Conference consists of a Chairman, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the United States Senate and ten additional members who, with the Chairman, comprise the Council. Between 75 and 101 individuals serve in the Conference, including government employees and non-government employees who are experts in administrative law or other relevant areas.United States Code, 1994 ed.: Organic laws; Title 1‚ÄîGeneral provisions (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1994), p. 547. The Conference is divided into six standing committees: Adjudication, Administration, Public Processes, Judicial Review, Regulation, and Rulemaking. The Conference must meet at least once per year, and no member is paid except for the Chairman. Chapter 3 describes the various activities that can be undertaken by the Conference, including studies, information interchanges between administrative agencies, and assistance to administrative bodies in other countries with the approval of the Department of State. It also describes the Chairman's authority within the Conference, including the authority to make inquiries and encourage agencies to adopt the recommendations of the Conference. Part 304 within Chapter 3 describes the procedures for the disclosure of records under the Freedom of Information Act, as well as regulations protecting privacy and access to records under the Privacy Act of 1974. =Chapter 4: Miscellaneous Agencies= Generally, the regulations in this chapter concern specific activities of the named agencies pursuant to laws enacted by Congress: * Privacy Act protections are included in Part 425, for applicants to the White House Fellowship program, and in Part 455, for those involved with the National Capital Planning Commission. * Part 456 contains Freedom of Information Act regulations for the National Capital Planning Commission. * Parts 457 and 500 contain regulations enforcing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for the National Capital Planning Commission and the National Commission for Employment Policy respectively. Applicable court cases In Cervase v. Office of Federal Register (1978), John Cervase, an attorney representing himself, complained that the Office of the Federal Register was required by law to publish an analytic subject index of the Code of Federal Regulations, and their failure to do so impacted his ability to practice law. Cervase's complaint noted that the 164-page table of contents for the 120-volume Code is woefully inadequate. The government argued that since the Administrative Committee of the Federal Register has the responsibility to spell out the specific requirements for publishing the Federal Register, it is beyond judicial review. The district court dismissed the case, but upon appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the case was remanded to the district court for further action. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that under existing regulations, there is a \\"plain and mandatory duty\\" for the Office to provide indices, particularly since the Office had not further defined what an \\"index\\" was, thus defaulting to the commonly understood definition. Further, Congress intended to allow judicial review of the Office's failure to implement this regulation under Public Law 94-574. Cervase thus had standing to sue the government. However, a dissent filed by Judge Garth noted that a general subject index was available, which satisfied Congress' requirement. That same year, in United States v. Mowat (1978), the petitioner, Karl Mowat, argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that his conviction for violating a federal regulation was invalid because the regulation in question was not properly published in the Federal Register as required by law. Mowat was accused of violating COMFOURTEEN Instruction 5510.35, a regulation restricting access to Kahoolawe Island, Hawaii, which was used by the U.S. military for target practice. The instruction was issued on January 14, 1976, but was not published in the Federal Register until January 4, 1978. The government argued that the instruction did not need to be published, citing a provision in Title 32 of the CFR that says that regulations that are \\"essentially local in its scope or application\\" need not be published. However, that same provision requires the publication of \\"substantive rules of general applicability,\\" as defined in Title 1, despite the provision in Title 32. Because the regulation in question defined a \\"course of conduct,\\" where violating the regulation would be considered a criminal act, it should have been published. Regardless, in this particular case, the use of the regulation against the defendants was valid, since the defendants knew about it anyway. A case argued in the United States Tax Court, Jesse S. Frederick v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (1999), addressed the issue of whether a regulation issued that does not cite a corresponding statute is valid. Frederick argued that such a regulation is not valid, citing , and that regulations issued pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code are thus invalid. However, Title 1 also says that the lack of citation does not affect a regulation's validity, so the regulations are effective regardless.

Life Arnold was born in 1800. His father, Thomas Graham Arnold, was a doctor of Stamford. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, was seventh junior optime in the mathematical tripos of 1821, and was elected fellow of his college shortly afterwards. He took his degree of B.A. in the same year, and that of M.A. in 1824. In 1830 he was presented to the living of Lyndon, in Rutlandshire, where his parishioners only numbered one hundred. He at first devoted his ample leisure to theology, and showed himself an obstinate opponent of the views advanced by the leaders of the Oxford movement. From 1838 until his death he applied himself mainly to the preparation of school books, which procured him a very wide reputation. He died at Lyndon Rectory of bronchitis after a few days' illness on 9 March 1853. A writer in the Guardian at the time of his death describes him as \\"remarkable for an almost feminine gentleness of manner, and for the unaffected simplicity of his life.\\" Works =Classics textbooks= Arnold began his career as an educational writer with the publication of the Essentials of Greek Accidence in 1838, and this work was followed almost immediately by his Practical Introduction to Greek Prose Composition, which had an unprecedented success, and was \\"the keystone of his literary fortunes.\\" The book reached a fourth edition in 1841, and a seventh in 1849, when its sales had exceeded 20,000 copies. It was at once adopted as a textbook in the higher classes of the chief schools of England. Its leading merit consisted in its author's judicious use of the system and researches of recent German scholars ‚Äî \\"in applying the method of Ollendorff to the syntax of Buttmann.\\" In 1839 Arnold issued a Latin Prose Composition on a similar plan. It met with a welcome scarcely less warm than that accorded to its forerunner and became the basis for the immensely popular revision by George Granville Bradley known as \\"Bradley's Arnold\\". In the succeeding years he prepared a whole library of classical school-books, which included translations and adaptations of many German and American works. In association with the Rev. J. E. Riddle he published in 1847 an English-Latin Lexicon, based on a German work by Dr. C. E. Georges, which cost him, he wrote in the preface, \\"many years of labour.\\" Between 1848 and 1853 he edited, in twenty-five volumes, portions of all the chief Latin and Greek authors, and published handbooks of classical antiquities, the Anticleptic Gradus and similar works. =Other school textbooks= Nor did he confine himself to the classics. He superintended the publication of English, French, German, Italian, and Hebrew grammars, and aided in the preparation of a Handbook of Hebrew Antiquities and a Boy's Arithmetic. Almost all his educational writings bear the distinct impress of German influence. In his classical work he depended largely on Madvig, Krtiger, Zumpt, and other less known scholars; his treatment of modern languages was also based on German models, and Arnold was generally ready to acknowledge his obligations to foreign writers. =Theology= As a theological writer Arnold was almost equally voluminous. His earliest published work was a sermon on the Faith of Abel, which appeared in the third volume of a collection of Family Sermons in 1833, and four years later he projected and edited a periodical under the title of the Churchman's Quarterly Magazine, which soon perished. Subsequently, he made two similar attempts to further the interests of the Church of England by means of periodical literature. In January 1844 he published the first number of the Churchman's Monthly Companion, which succumbed to popular indifference eight months later, and in 1851 he started another monthly magazine, entitled the Theological Critic, which lived on until his death in 1853. Arnold's contributions to theological literature also included five pamphlets on ecclesiastical questions raised by the Oxford Movement; an abridgment of an American version of Hengstenberg's Christology; two volumes of sermons, one published in 1845, and the other posthumously in 1858; and Short Helps to Daily Devotion (1847). He likewise issued controversial treatises criticising well-known theological works like Taylor's Interpretations of the Fathers, Elliott's Hor√¶ Apocalyptic√¶, and Dean Close's sermons, in all of which, according to a sympathetic critic in the Guardian of 1853, \\"his critical eye discerned unsoundness . . . which, if not exposed, was likely to do extensive mischief.\\" =Critical reaction= In an article in Fraser's Magazine for February 1853, afterwards published in pamphlet form and attributed to John William Donaldson, an attempt was made to discredit Arnold's classical schoolbooks. In a temperate reply, written a few weeks before his death, Arnold rebutted some of the more sinister imputations on his character in the article. The popularity of a few of the books that Donaldson specially denounced survived his attack.

After completing his theological studies he was licensed by the Church of Scotland in October 1837 and became assistant minister to Rev John Bonar of Larbert and Dunipace. In 1838 he found a patron and was ordained minister of St Peter's Church in Glasgow, one of the new quoad sacra churches built under the extension scheme of Rev Thomas Chalmers. At the Disruption of 1843 he left the established church and joined the Free Church of Scotland, taking a large portion of his congregation with him.Ewings Annals of the Free Church In 1863, on the appointment of Rev Dr Robert Rainy to a professorship, Arnot was called to replace Rainy as minister of the Free High Church in Edinburgh, housed in New College, Edinburgh.Ewings Annals of the Free Church: Free High Church While in Edinburgh, from 1871, he edited a monthly religious magazine, the Family Treasury. He three times visited America: in 1845, to minister in Canada; in 1870 as a delegate from the Free Church of Scotland to congratulate the presbyterian churches in the northern states on their reunion; and for the third time, in 1873, as a member of the Evangelical Alliance, to attend its meetings at New York. Having been a sympathiser with the northern states and the anti-slavery movement, he was well received in the United States. The honorary degree of D.D. was offered to Arnot by the University of Glasgow, and afterwards formally by the University of New York; but for personal reasons he declined both. He died after a six month illness at his home, 8 Merchiston AvenueEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1875 in Edinburgh, 3 June 1875.

All the rivers of Pakistan, i.e. Sindh, Ravi River, Chenab River, Jhelum River, and Sutlej River, originate from the Himalayas mountain range. Some geographers designate Plateau as to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line. Elevation extremes K2 Peak Lowest point: Sea level Highest point: K2 (Mt. Godwin-Austen) 8,611 m The northern mountains and the mountains of western North In the north, northeast and north-west of Pakistan there are three ranges of mountains. Between these ranges of the Himalayas is an area the people of Central and South Asia consider to be the roof of the world. The Himalayas stretch continuously for about 2500 km from east to west. They are bounded to the north-west by the Hindu Kush mountain range and to the north by the Karakoram. Thus there are three mountain ranges in northern Pakistan: Karakoram, Himalayas and Hindu Kush. The contrast between these ranges is geologically interesting  The Indus Plain  Land between two rivers is called DOAB in the local language. The name Indus comes from the Sanskrit word \\"sindhu\\", meaning \\"ocean\\", from which also come the words Sindh, Hindu, and India. The Indus River, one of the great rivers of the world, rises in southwestern Tibet, only about 160 kilometers west of the source of the Sutlej River, which joins the Indus in Punjab, and the Brahmaputra, which runs eastward before turning southwest and flowing through Bangladesh. The catchment area of the Indus is estimated at almost 1 million square kilometers, and all of Pakistan's major rivers (the Kabul River, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej) flow into it. The Indus River basin is a large, fertile alluvial plain formed by silt from the Indus. This area has been inhabited by agricultural civilizations for at least 5,000 years. The upper Indus Basin includes Punjab; the lower Indus Basin begins at the Panjnad River (the confluence of the eastern tributaries of the Indus) and extends south to the coast. Punjab means the \\"land of five waters\\": the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers.http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/24.htm, Topography and Drainage of Pakistan on countrystudies.us/Pakistan website, Retrieved 15 Aug 2016 The Sutlej river, however, is mostly on the Indian side of the border. In the southern part of the province of Punjab, the British attempted to harness the irrigation power of the water over 100 years ago when they established what came to be known as the Canal Colonies. The irrigation project, which facilitated the emergence of intensive cultivation despite semi-arid conditions, resulted in important social and political transformations. Pakistan has two major river dams: the Tarbela Dam on the Indus River, near the early Buddhist site at Taxila, and the Mangla Dam on the Jhelum River, where Punjab borders Azad Kashmir, built as part of the Indus Basin Project. The Warsak Dam on the Kabul River near Peshawar is smaller. These dams, along with a series of headworks and barrages built by the British and expanded since the independence of Pakistan in 1947, are of vital importance to the national economy and played an important role in calming the raging floodwaters of 1992, which devastated large areas in the northern highlands and the Punjab plains.  The Desert Areas  Thar Desert satellite imagery =Cholistan Desert= The Cholistan desert spans an area of 16,000 square kilometers. The name \\"Cholistan\\" is derived from the Turkish word \\"chol,\\" meaning \\"desert,\\" though the desert is locally known as Rohi. The desert hosts an annual jeep rally, which draws many tourists. =Indus Valley Desert= The Indus Valley Desert is located in the northern area of Pakistan. The desert spans an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is surrounded by northwestern scrub forests. The Indus Valley Desert lies between two major rivers in the region, the Chenab and the Indus. =Kharan Desert= The [Kharan Desert] is located in Northeast Balochistan (a Pakistan state). The desert was used for [Chagai-II] nuclear testing by the Pakistan military], making it the most famous of the five deserts. The desert is in the centre of a large empty basin. =Thal Desert= The [Thal Desert] is located in north east Pakistan between the Indus and Jhelum rivers. A large canal-building project is currently underway to irrigate the land. Irrigation will make most of the desert suitable for farming. =Thar Desert= The [Thar Desert] spans a stammering 446 square kilometres and covers large areas of both Pakistan and India. It is the List of deserts by areaseventeenth largest desert] on the planet and the third largest in [Asia].  Potowar Plateau  Tilla Jogian, 2nd highest peak in Potwar The Potwar Plateau (also Potowar or Potohar) is a plateau in the province of Punjab, Pakistan and the western parts of Pakistan administered Kashmir. The area was the home of the [Soanian  Soanian Culture], which is evidenced by the discovery of fossils, tools, coins, and remains of ancient archaeological sites. The local people speak the Potwari language. Pothohar Plateau is bounded on the east by the Jhelum River, on the west by the Indus River, on the north by the Kala Chitta Range and the Margalla Hills, and on the south by the Salt Range. =Balochistan Plateau= The Balochistan plateau is located in the south-west of Pakistan with altitudes mainly ranging from 600‚Äì3010 metres. This is an extensive area of 347,190 km2 with a number of distinct natural topographical and drainage features that can be identified as follows: ‚ñ™ Basins of Northern Balochistan ‚ñ™ Basins of Western Balochistan ‚ñ™ Mountain ranges ‚ñ™ Coastal areas Salt Range in District Minawali Punjab pakistan =Salt Range= The Salt Range is a hill system in the Punjab province of Pakistan, deriving its name from its extensive deposits of rock salt. The range extends from the Jhelum River to the Indus, across the northern portion of the Punjab province. The Salt Range contains the great mines of Mayo, Khewra Salt Mine, Warcha and Kalabagh, which yield vast supplies of salt. Coal of a medium quality is also found. It is believed that the Salt Range was founded by the horses of Alexander the Great's army.  Sistan Basin  Balochistan is located at the eastern edge of the Iranian plateau and in the border region between Southwest, Central, and South Asia. It is geographically the largest of Pakistan's four provinces, at 347,190 km¬≤ or 134,051 square miles, and composes 48% of the total land area of Pakistan. The population density is very low due to the mountainous terrain and scarcity of water. The southern region is known as Makran. The central region is known as Kalat.http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and- Oceania/Pakistan-TOPOGRAPHY.html, Retrieved 15 Aug 2016 The Sulaiman Mountains dominate the northeast corner, and the Bolan Pass is a natural route into Afghanistan towards Kandahar. Much of the province south of the Quetta region is sparse desert terrain with pockets of inhabitable land, mostly near rivers and streams. The largest desert is the Kharan Desert which occupies the most of Kharan District. This area is subject to frequent seismic disturbances because the tectonic plate under the Indian plate collides with the plate under Eurasia as it continues to move northward and to push the Himalayas ever higher. The region surrounding Quetta is highly prone to earthquakes. A severe quake in 1931 was followed by an even more destructive one in 1935. The small city of Quetta was almost completely destroyed, and the adjacent military cantonment was heavily damaged. At least 20,000 people were killed. Tremors continue in the vicinity of Quetta; the most recent major earthquake occurred in October 2008. In January 1991 a severe earthquake destroyed entire villages in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, but it was luckily not as bad as 1935 where almost all of Quetta was destroyed 5. A major earthquake centred in the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa's Kohistan District in 1965 also caused heavy damage.

Involving forces from Australia, the United States and Japan, the fighting centred on the Sattelberg mission station which was situated atop a hill about above sea level, approximately inland from Finschhafen, New Guinea. Following the Australian landing at Scarlet Beach, a large force of Japanese had retreated inland towards Sattelberg. Holding the high ground, the Japanese subsequently threatened the Australian lines of communication as they proceeded to advance south towards Finschhafen, and in order to neutralise this threat, the Australian 26th Brigade was tasked with capturing the mission. Over the course of 10 days they advanced west from Jivevaneng up the southern approaches to the mission, reducing the Japanese position with armour, artillery and air support, before the Japanese finally abandoned Sattelberg and withdrew north to Wareo, having suffered heavy casualties and running low on supplies. Background Following the fall of Lae in September 1943, the Australians continued their advance north along the New Guinea coast towards the Huon Peninsula, with the aim of securing Finschhafen, where large scale air and naval facilities could be constructed for operations that were planned against New Britain. On 22 September 1943, less than a week after Lae had been captured, Brigadier Victor Windeyer's Australian 20th Brigade was detached from the 9th Division by Major General George Wootten, the divisional commander, and landed at Scarlet Beach (north of Siki Cove), to the east of Katika and about to the north of Finschhafen. alt=A simple map depicting an island and its surrounds The landing was only lightly opposed, and the Australians began to advance south towards Katika where Japanese resistance was stronger, but was nevertheless overcome by the early afternoon. As the 20th Brigade advanced south towards their objective at Finschhafen, intelligence indicated that the Japanese were moving to the high ground to the west at Sattelberg, which was situated about above sea level. Captured documents showed that three infantry battalions were being concentrated at an old Lutheran mission station that had been established at Sattelberg in the 19th century during the German colonial administration of the area. Concerned for the security of his lines of communication due to the presence of Japanese on his flank, the Australian brigade commander adopted more cautious tactics, while reinforcements were called for. Heavy fighting ensued, but Finschhafen fell to the Australians on 2 October. Following this, the 9th Division was tasked with advancing towards Sio, further around the coast on the northern side of the Huon Peninsula. The Japanese in the area around Finschhafen were growing in strength, however, as a large number of the 4,000 to 5,000 men that had garrisoned Finschhafen had managed to escape inland, while the rest of the 20th Division, under the command of Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, was being moved from Bogadjim, south of Madang, to provide reinforcements. Wootten considered that the threat posed by this force meant that Sattelberg would have to be captured before the 9th Division could undertake its advance towards Sio. Prelude =Advance on Finschhafen= During the advance on Finschhafen, a company from the 2/17th Battalion, which had been tasked with securing the beachhead and the flank, had been sent to Sattelberg but had been unable to occupy it due to the strength of the Japanese force already there. As captured orders had revealed Japanese plans to breakthrough to the coast, it was decided to place the company into a blocking position east of Sattelberg along the coast road around Jivevaneng. In this position, from 25 September onwards they were subjected to a number of attacks as they attempted to deflect attacks by the Japanese 3rd Battalion, 80th Infantry Regiment, which were aimed at breaking through to Heldsbach Plantation, directly south of the beachhead at Siki Cove. On 30 September the 2/17th were replaced by a company from the 2/43rd Battalion, and over the next couple of days, a whole battalion of Japanese surrounded the position and attacked it eight times. Four attempts by the Australians to relieve the company failed, before an attack on Kumawa by the 2/17th Battalion on 5 October cut the Japanese supply lines and provoked a strong counterattack, which subsequently drew pressure off the beleaguered company, and enabled it to be relieved on 7 October. As the threat of Japanese counterattack grew, the 24th Brigade landed at Langemak Bay on 10 October to reinforce the 20th Brigade. The following day, Wootten was able to establish his divisional headquarters at Finschhafen, and preparations began for the Australians to attack the Japanese force around Sattelberg. alt=Two soldiers walk along a beach beside the wrecked remains of a number of barges During this time, the Japanese were also planning an offensive. On 10 October, the Japanese 20th Division's commander, Katagiri, arrived at Sattelberg having trekked overland from Sio. After taking over operational control of the forces there, on 12 October he issued orders for an attack to commence on 16 October. This attack was conceptualised as consisting of two infantry regiments, the 79th and 80th, supported by three artillery batteries from the 26th Field Artillery Regiment, a company from the 20th Engineer Regiment and the divisional signals unit. As a part of this offensive, the 80th Infantry Regiment would continue to make attacks on the Australian forces around Jivevaneng, while the 79th Infantry Regiment would drive towards Katika and attempt to break through to the coast to attack the beachhead at Scarlet Beach, where a seaborne assault would be made concurrently by 70 men from the Sugino Craft Raiding Unit. The Australians had learned about Katagiri's plans and as a result the 9th Division commander, Wootten, decided to put off his own offensive plans while the Japanese attack was dealt with. It came in the early hours of 17 October, and over the course of the following week heavy fighting ensued around Katika and Jivevaneng. Forewarned, the Australians were able to check these attacks with assistance from American support units, and by the time that the Japanese called off their offensive on 25 October, the Japanese 20th Division had suffered 352 men killed and 564 wounded, while the Australians had suffered 228 casualties. It was during the early stages of this fighting that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the deeds that resulted in him being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. =Japanese preparations= alt=A map indicating the movement of military units along a coast with different coloured lines With the 79th Infantry Regiment having lost around 50% of its strength and with ammunition and food running low (by the end of the month, they had been reduced to quarter rations), the Japanese divisional commander, Katagiri, made the decision to call off the attack in order to pull back from Jivevaneng and Katika and regroup on the higher ground further west around the mission. This order was passed on the morning of 24 October, and by the morning of 27 October the Japanese 20th Division's subunits had managed to regroup to the east of Sattelberg. Following this, Katagiri received orders from the 18th Army commander, General Hataz≈ç Adachi, who delivered them personally at Sattelberg, for the 20th Division to prepare to hold the mission and to engage in offensive operations in the immediate vicinity. As a part of this plan, Katagiri decided that he would use the 80th Infantry Regiment to defend Sattelberg, while the 79th would concentrate in the Nongora area with the intention of launching a counter-attack upon the Australian forces advancing from Katika, near the Song River on 25 November. Around Sattelberg, the 80th Infantry Regiment was deployed in five key locations. Three companies from the regiment's 2nd Battalion established a position at the 2,200 feature (known as \\"Saheki-yama\\" to the Japanese), and another three companies from the 3rd Battalion were positioned astride the Sattelberg road at \\"Miyake-dai\\", or the 2,600 feature. Another two companies were positioned to the south of the main position at \\"Yamada-yama\\", while the remainder of the regiment was entrenched around the mission itself‚Äîthe \\"Kanshi-yama\\"‚Äîwhere they had established a formidable \\"fortress\\", and around the Japanese commander's \\"keep\\" which was positioned on the 3,200 feature, known as the \\"Katagiri-yama\\". The strength of these forces was estimated by the Australian commander, Wootten, to be around 2,800 men in the immediate vicinity of Sattelberg mission, with a further 2,400 around Nongora and another 1,000 to the north at Gusika. These estimates were confirmed after the fighting. The Japanese defenders were supported by the 4th Air Army, with fighter and bomber aircraft from the 6th and 7th Air Divisions flying close support missions against Australian artillery positions, carrying out bombing operations around the Finschhafen area, and dropping supplies by air around Sattelberg and Wareo throughout October. =Allied preparations= Prior to the attack on Sattelberg, the Australians needed reinforcements. Although initially the Allied higher commanders were reluctant to provide these, on 25 October the Militia 4th Brigade was detached from the 5th Division and placed under the operational control of the 9th Division. These troops were subsequently used in a defensive role around the beachhead to free up the rest of the 9th Division for the offensive operations. The 2/43rd Battalion, from the 24th Brigade, was also brought up on 30 September, ahead of the rest of the brigade which arrived later in October. Nevertheless, by the end of September, the Allies perceived the situation around Finschhafen to be \\"reasonably secure\\", and American engineer and construction units, including the 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion, started to arrive in October. By December they had begun work constructing an airfield and other base facilities around Dreger Harbour. Following this, Wootten began finalising his plans for assaulting Sattelberg. Because the 20th Brigade had borne the brunt of the fighting following the landing in September, the 26th Brigade, which had landed at Langemak Bay on the night of 20 October under Brigadier David Whitehead, was chosen to spearhead the attack. At the same time, the 20th and 24th Brigades, operating in the central and northern sectors, would continue patrolling operations in order to keep the Japanese off balance. alt=A group of soldiers kneel while another points to a mud model on the ground Support for the 26th Brigade's attack would be provided by divisional assets, including Matilda tanks from 'C' Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion, whose presence the Australians took great lengths to keep secret, artillery from the 2/12th Field Regiment and later (after it was found that the 25-pdrs could not be transported up the Sattelberg Road), the 2nd Mountain Battery, and support-by-fire from the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion. The 2/13th Field Company supplied engineer detachments to each battalion, while air assets were provided by the United States 5th Air Force and No. 4 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, which was an Army co-operation squadron that was equipped with Boomerangs and Wirraways, and provided aerial observation in support of artillery operations. Vengeance dive bombers from No. 24 Squadron, RAAF also provided support, while Japanese supply lines were disrupted by Allied aircraft and PT boats. Supplies for the operation were landed by American landing craft from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment and brought forward using vehicles or carried by local porters. They were then \\"dumped\\" around Jivevaneng and Kumawa, where they could be distributed to individual battalions. However, the heavy rain that had fallen at the end of October hampered the buildup of stores and consequently delayed Australian preparations. As a result, their plans were not finalised until 15 November. At this time, Whitehead began issuing his orders. The concept of operations called for the capture of the 2,200 feature‚Äîso called by the Australians because that was its height in feet‚Äîfirst, before a subsequent westward advance to the mission. The 2/48th Battalion would advance west from Jivevaneng along the Sattelberg road supported by tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion, while the 2/24th Battalion would advance north-west across Siki Creek and capture the 2,200 feature. The 2/23rd Battalion, which would hand over its defensive duties to the 2/4th Commando Squadron, would start further south from Kumawa, protecting the left flank, and after paralleling the Sattelberg road, they would marry up with the 2/48th at a position called \\"Steeple Tree Hill\\", or the 2,600 feature, by the Australians (\\"Miyake-dai\\" to the Japanese), where it was planned to halt for resupply and re-appreciation before undertaking the final attack. It was decided that tanks, which would provide direct fire support for use against the Japanese bunker systems that were believed to be around Sattelberg, would only be employed along the Sattelberg road, as considerable engineer support was required to move the Matildas into position in the closed terrain. Battle =Initial Australian attack= On 17 November, fighting for the main position around Sattelberg commenced. The previous night, in order to prepare for the attack on the 2200 feature, the 2/48th Battalion captured Green Ridge, a small but important feature that dominated the Sattelberg road. The capture of the ridge secured a start line forward of Jivevaneng for Whitehead's 26th Brigade to launch the first stage of their attack upon Sattelberg. The following day, the 2/48th Battalion handed over responsibility for the defence of the ridge to a company from the 2/23rd Battalion, and the attack commenced amidst heavy supporting artillery and machine-gun fire. In response, the Japanese artillery from Sattelberg fired a limited barrage onto the Australians on Green Ridge. alt=An armoured vehicle moves through thick vegetation The terrain upon which the Australians advanced hampered their movement considerably. Consisting mainly of steep \\"razor-back\\" ridges and thick jungle which restricted the tactics that Whitehead could employ, the 26th Brigade mainly employed infiltration tactics, advancing on \\"narrow fronts\\" using columns of troops consisting of an infantry company forward, followed by a troop of tanks with an engineer section in support. Initially the Japanese were surprised by the presence of the Matilda tanks as their noise had been masked by the artillery and rocket barrage, and a number of positions were abandoned by Japanese soldiers who were put to flight upon seeing the tanks, however, as the day progressed the opposition stiffened and the defenders recovered after the initial shock. Progress subsequently became very slow, and as the 2/48th Battalion approached \\"Coconut Ridge\\" (designated Highland 5 by the Japanese) at around midday, one of the Matildas was disabled when it lost a track to an improvised explosive device which had been placed under the road by the defending Japanese. With the tanks isolated from their infantry support, a small Japanese team advanced from cover to attack a second tank which had come up to support the first, and taking the machine gunner by surprise, they placed an explosive charge in front of it. Although the resulting explosion did not knock the tank out of action, it trapped its crew inside for the rest of the day. Firing upon the Australians with machine-guns, mortars and grenades, the Japanese defenders upon Coconut Ridge held up the advance. Throughout the rest of the day, the 2/48th Battalion undertook a series of flanking attacks in which at least 80 Japanese were killed, however by nightfall the Japanese still held the ridge, and the 2/48th Battalion withdrew to a nearby knoll to reorganise, having suffered six killed and 26 wounded. Elsewhere, the other two Australian battalions had also found the going slow: the 2/24th had dug in east of the 2200 feature, while the 2/23rd had only managed to advance about half the expected distance. The Japanese abandoned Coconut Ridge that night, while in the morning the Australians brought up three replacement tanks. At around 7:00 am, an Australian patrol scouted the ridge and an hour later a platoon attack was put in, confirming that the defenders had gone. As battlefield clearance operations got underway, the tanks that had been disabled the day before were also repaired, bringing the total number of Matildas available to seven. In the early afternoon, the advance was resumed, however the Australians only managed to progress a further before they were halted by stiff opposition from Japanese armed with 37 mm anti-tank guns. A number of these pieces were destroyed and at least 40 Japanese were killed or wounded, but Japanese snipers inflicted a number of casualties upon the Australians, and although none were fatal it prevented any further gains as the 2/48th spent most of the day hunting the snipers in the trees. Elsewhere, in front of the 2,200 feature and on the southern flank, only limited progress was made by the Australians, who suffered a number of casualties from Japanese 75 mm mountain guns before these were silenced by a bombardment by the 2/12th Field Regiment. At dusk, the Australians dug in less than from the Japanese defence line and sporadic fighting continued throughout the night. That night, Wootten decided to take stock of the slow progress along the southern and central routes. Based on captured documents, Australian intelligence reports placed the number of Japanese troops around the mission at about 2,000 men. These men were believed to be from the 80th Infantry Regiment, which the Australians felt was close to exhaustion and unlikely to be able to withstand any further pressure. As a result of this information, Wootten decided to change the concept of operations. Although the 2/24th Battalion's attack on the 2,200 feature had originally been intended to serve as a holding action, the lack of progress by the 2/48th and 2/23rd encouraged Wootten to order the 26th Brigade's commander, Whitehead, to concentrate his efforts upon the 2,200 feature, turning the drive on Sattelberg into a \\"double-pronged\\" attack, with the 2/24th also attempting to break through to Sattelberg. alt=Soldiers wearing slouch hats and carrying rifles form up below a ridge line The following day, 19 November, the Australians came up against a series of prepared defences which further slowed their progress. Throughout the night the Japanese had dug a number of anti-tank ditches, about wide and deep, which Australian engineers had to fill before the tanks could continue. Progress was made, however, and amidst hand-to-hand fighting troops from the 2/48th managed to seize part of the 2,600 feature (Steeple Tree Hill), after engineers under the command of Lieutenant (later Captain) Augustus Spry, helped clear the way through the use of two fougasses that were fashioned out of 4-gallon drums filled with petrol, which were exploded in order to stun the Japanese and provide a smoke screen while the infantry attacked. The Japanese launched a counter-attack as dusk fell, but this was repelled with heavy losses: the Australians had 20 men killed or wounded, while the Japanese left behind 46 killed, as well as a number of machine-guns and mortars, as they withdrew from the position. The 2/23rd Battalion to the south, up against the same defensive system that was delaying the 2/48th, was also held up further, while on the northern route, the 2/24th found the 2,200 feature unoccupied, but was unable to proceed further after they came under heavy machine-gun and artillery fire. The fourth day of the assault, 20 November, brought no forward movement for the Australians at the 2,200 feature as the 80th Infantry Regiment's 2nd Battalion fought tenaciously to prevent the 2/24th from moving forward. Nevertheless, it was a different story for the Australians on the main road as the 3rd Battalion, 80th Infantry Regiment was forced back towards \\"Point 7\\". At the start of the day, the Australian 2/48th Battalion had only been able to advance a further before their progress was held up by thick scrub which delayed their tank support, however, to the south, the 2/23rd Battalion moved up the southern slope of Steeple Tree Hill and over the course of the afternoon gradually forced the defenders back. The 2/48th made slow progress but by 6:35 pm they reported that they had reached the summit of the hill and as night fell, the two Australian battalions were separated by about . Caught between two groups of Australians, during the course of the night the two Japanese companies that had been holding the position abandoned it, and fell back towards the main defensive position at Sattelberg. =Japanese counter- attack= For the Japanese, the supply situation around Sattelberg was worsening. Although some supplies were successfully air dropped, the defenders were reduced to consuming only a third of the standard daily ration and Katagiri's supply of artillery shells was very low, despite adherence to strict fire discipline. Given the desperate supply situation, which was made all the worse when the 24th Brigade cut the track between Gusika and Wareo, the Japanese 18th Army commander, Adachi, gave Katagiri approval to withdraw from Sattelberg after 20 November. Katagiri subsequently ordered Colonel Sadahiko Miyake, the commander of the 80th Infantry Regiment, to inflict as many casualties upon the Australians as possible and then begin a progressive withdrawal to Wareo. Nevertheless, Katagiri was determined to launch a counterattack further to the north-east. When formulating his defence plans in October, he had originally intended to launch an attack from Nongora with the 79th Infantry Regiment on 25 November, however, with the Australians advancing steadily towards the main position at Sattelberg, Katagiri decided to bring this forward in order to take some of the pressure off the troops defending the mission. After moving into position on 21 November, the attack was launched the following day. Wootten had predicted this, based upon documents that had been captured by the Australians, and Brigadier Selwyn Porter's 24th Brigade had thoroughly prepared for the onslaught. The 79th Infantry Regiment crossed the Song River and attacked Scarlet Beach from the west, while the 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment, which had been detached from the 41st Division, attacked south from Gusika. By using infiltration tactics the Japanese skirted around the lead elements of the 24th Brigade in an attack that was intended to roll up the Australian rear elements, however, the Australians in turn attacked the flanks of the Japanese units, mauling their supply columns and inflicting heavy casualties upon them. This had the effect of squeezing the strength out of the Japanese counterattack and forcing them into undertaking piecemeal attacks which were dealt with by the Australians with relative ease. As a result, although the fighting around Scarlet Beach continued until 28 November when the Japanese units that had been involved were withdrawn towards Wareo, it did not have the urgency to affect the 26th Brigade's advance on Sattelberg and was largely broken up by 23 November. =Australian attack resumed= alt=Soldiers carry a stretcher upon which another man lies After being forced off Steeple Tree Hill, Miyake, commanding the main Japanese defensive unit, the 80th Infantry Regiment, decided to concentrate his defence upon the saddle at \\"Point 10\\" which was positioned to the west of the 2,200 feature, at Sattelberg itself and on the 3,200 feature to the north-west. An intense five-day Allied aerial bombardment, which had begun on 19 November, had destroyed the majority of the Japanese guns around Sattelberg, and the ammunition and food situation had become critical, despite the arrival of several tonnes of rice at Wareo the day before. Throughout 21 November, there was a lull in the battle as the Australians paused for resupply. However, by the end of the day Whitehead had made good his supply situation and the advance resumed the following day. In an effort to find the best possible route, the Australians sent out small reconnaissance patrols and based on the intelligence they gained Whitehead produced a new set of orders prior to stepping off on 22 November. The 2/48th continued to advance along the road; the 2/23rd were to break track beyond Steeple Tree Hill at a location dubbed \\"Turn-Off Corner\\" and advance around behind the mission, to attack the 3,200 feature, while the 2/24th Battalion were to advance west, attempting to bypass the main Japanese positions in front of the 2,200 feature via an adjacent saddle to assist in the capture of Sattelberg, while also sending a detachment further north to secure Palanko. Following the fall of Steeple Tree Hill, the Japanese were less inclined to engage the Australian forces, nevertheless the advance continued to be frustratingly slow for the Australian commanders. The terrain over which the final part of the advance was undertaken was particularly taxing on the troops involved. Many of the slopes up which they were required to advance had gradients of at least 45 degrees, which meant that even reasonably short distances took considerable time To make matters worse, near the junction of the Siki Creek, a landslide caused by the Allied bombing, coupled with a number of land mines that the Japanese had planted, blocked the main road to Sattelberg, meaning that the soldiers from the 2/48th would have to make the final attack on Sattelberg without armoured support. In an effort to counter this problem, Whitehead determined that the tanks would be re-allocated to the 2/23rd, in the hope that a new route would be opened up by the engineers. Although he was being pressured by the divisional commander to increase the speed of the advance, Whitehead was said to be reasonably happy with the progress being made by the 2/48th along the central route, although he had misgivings about the performance of the 2/23rd on the left and the 2/24th on the right. To some extent, the failure of the 2/24th to take the 2,200 feature could be attributed to the importance which the Japanese commander, Katagiri, placed upon its defence, however, Whitehead believed that the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Gillespie, was procrastinating and being overly cautious in his tactics. Nevertheless, it was later realised that the terrain which the 2/24th faced was more formidable than first thought, and that in order for the battalion to make progress, they too, like the 2/48th, would need tanks. Some attempt was made by the Australians to bring these up from the rear areas, but ultimately the fighting around Sattelberg came to an end before this could be effected. On the brigade's left, south of the main route, the pace of the 2/23rd's advance had also caused Whitehead some concern. Indeed, Whitehead went as far to express this to the 2/23rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Tucker, who pointed out that his lack of progress had been caused by the large number of tasks that the battalion had been assigned, namely the competing demands to secure the flank while attempting to move quickly through broken country in order to make its scheduled rendezvous with the 2/48th. On 23 November, Allied bombers attacked the fortress at Sattelberg, as well as defensive positions around Kumawa. The 2/48th, nearing their objective, cautiously began to probe the outer positions, while to the north, three companies from the 2/24th managed to reach the saddle that lay below the north-eastern approach to the mission, although there was still uncertainty as to whether or not the Japanese had withdrawn from the 2,200 feature. To the south-west, the 2/23rd began skirting north around the main positions at Sattelberg, making for the 3,200 feature. After they had struck Turn-Off Corner, the infantry from the 2/23rd were accompanied by engineers from the 2/13th Field Company, who were tasked with laying down a makeshift road, over which the tanks that had been re-allocated to the 2/23rd would traverse. =Final assault= By 24 November the Australians were within striking distance of the mission atop the summit. A reconnaissance patrol the previous evening had provided the Australian commander with the idea to send a company from the 2/48th over the Siki Creek and attack the mission from the south-east up a steep escarpment that was covered in thick kunai grass, which offered an attacking force a degree of concealment. A red roofed hut stood at the point where the attack was aimed. This was about below the Lutheran church that formed the main part of the mission. Around the hut, the Japanese had constructed a number of reinforced defensive positions and although they had not been damaged by the numerous aerial attacks that had been launched by the Allies during the previous week, it was believed that because the approach was so difficult, it might be lightly defended. alt=Soldiers stand in front of a dilapidated shed During the morning, while a diversionary attack was made by the 2/23rd Battalion, and patrols from the 2/24th to the north attempted to break through, a company from the 2/48th, under the command of Captain Deane Hill, attempted to reach the summit at Sattelberg. Two platoons launched attacks during the early afternoon, but were beaten back by the twenty Japanese defenders that were dug in around the spur. Late in the afternoon, a third platoon, 11 Platoon, under the command of Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Tom Derrick, attempted another attack from further to the right of the position but it too was checked by machine-gun fire and lobbed grenades. As the light began to fade, Derrick reported his lack of progress to his company commander and was subsequently ordered to withdraw, so that another attempt could be made in the morning. Derrick's response to this order was to obfuscate, however, and instead of withdrawing, he subsequently led his platoon forward, attacking 10 Japanese positions with grenades as his men supported him with Bren and Owen submachine-gun fire. After stopping about from the summit, Derrick's platoon continued to hold their position through the night. Elsewhere, the 2/24th Battalion reported that they were just below the crest of the 2,200 feature, the last Japanese defensive position to the north, and that they would capture it the following morning, before proceeding on to their secondary objective at Palanko. Believing that the key to taking Sattelberg lay in having the 2/24th in a position to support the 2/48th's final attack, Whitehead pressured for the tanks to get up to the 2/24th as soon as possible. The following morning, at first light, spurred on by the example provided by 11 Platoon, reinforcements from the 2/48th came up to complete the capture of Sattelberg. Just after dawn, a heavy artillery barrage was brought down on the summit by Australian artillery in preparation for the final attack. At 8:25 am patrols were sent out from 'B' Company, 2/48th Battalion, and they subsequently reported that the Japanese had abandoned the position sometime during the night. Indeed, it was later established that Miyake, who had been in command of the troops gathered around the mission and had been given permission to abandon Sattelberg if the situation became untenable, had decided to withdraw from the position soon after Derrick's attack. Fifty minutes later, the lead elements of the 2/48th Battalion entered the main mission complex, which was found to be quite badly damaged. Finally, at 10:00 am, upon the insistence of the 2/48th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Ainslie, Derrick was given the honour of raising the Australian flag over the mission, signifying that the battle had come to an end. Shortly after this, the tanks finally reached the 2/24th Battalion, and the 2,200 feature was also captured. Upon completion of the flag-raising ceremony, a company from the 2/48th moved on to the 3,200 feature, which had also been abandoned, while further to the west, the 2/23rd, along with the 2/4th Commando Squadron cleared Mararuo and in the process found evidence that the Japanese had withdrawn towards Wareo. Aftermath alt=Men armed with rifles and light machine-guns advance along a track behind an armoured vehicle During the fighting around Sattelberg, the Australians lost 49 men killed and a further 118 wounded. In the circumstances, this was considered to be light. Japanese casualties are unknown, but are believed to have been \\"heavy\\": a large number of Japanese bodies were found during the advance on Sattelberg, while another 59 were counted around the 2/24th's position on the 2200 feature, and captured documents indicated that the defenders had been close to starvation. A large quantity of weapons were also captured, including two 75 mm artillery pieces, three 37 mm anti-tank guns and 18 Type 92 Heavy Machine Guns (colloquially known as \\"Woodpeckers\\"), as well as a considerable number of mortars, light machine-guns and assorted small arms. Following the capture of Sattelberg on 25 November, the 26th Brigade continued to advance to the north. Further fighting ensued as they pushed on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December. After the Australians took Wareo, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio, where subsequent fighting took place throughout December 1943 and early 1944. For his actions during the final assault on the mission, Derrick was awarded the Victoria Cross‚Äîhis nation's highest military decoration. Derrick was the fourth soldier from the 2/48th Battalion to receive the award; by the end of the hostilities the 2/48th had the distinction of being the most highly decorated Australian Army unit of the Second World War. The following Australian units received the battle honour of \\"Sattelberg\\" for their involvement in the battle: 1st Tank Battalion, 2/23rd Battalion, 2/24th Battalion, 2/48th Battalion and the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion.

Nearly 70 men were charged, and three were convicted by jury; the Oregon Supreme Court then reversed the convictions on legal technicalities. Beginnings At the time the scandal broke, Oregon's sodomy law merely said, \\"If any person shall commit sodomy or the crime against nature, either with mankind or beast, such person, upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than one year nor more than five years.\\"Lord's Oregon Laws, ¬ß 2099. Up to this point, in some U.S. states with sodomy laws similar to Oregon's, courts had ruled that these statutes covered anal sex, but not oral sex.Boag, p. 204. These cases cited the 1817 English case Rex v. Jacobs, Russ & Ry 331. Following the arrest and interrogation of a teenager for shoplifting, he told his interrogators that \\"he had been 'corrupted' by a number of men in town.\\" The teenager was identified variously as fourteen-year-old Hazen Wright for shoplifting or nineteen-year-old Benjamin Trout. The person identified as the perpetrator was Harry Rowe, 39, who lived at the local YMCA, which had the ninth largest membership of all YMCAs in North America. This revelation prompted police investigations and led to the arrest of 69 men \\"for crimes ranging from so- called indecent acts to sodomy.\\" The press used the term \\"vice clique\\" to refer to these men collectively. Since a crime against nature such as this could not be consensual, the parties are described as predators and victims or \\"boy victim\\", though only categorized by which participant was older. Some members of the vice clique were prominent public figures including Edward McAllister, as well as lawyers and physicians. Some of the accused lived at the local YMCA and which was supported by members of Portland's upper class. Considered \\"unprintable\\" content, it still prompted attacks against the YMCA, its sponsors, and the city's upper class, especially by the working-class newspaper The Portland News and its editor Dana Sleeth.  Members of the vice clique  =Theodore Kruse and the Louvre= The scandal also exposed Theodore Kruse and the Louvre restaurant in Portland, which he had owned. Kruse (born Feb. 13, 1864, Germany, died Nov. 3, 1941, Gearhart, Oregon) started in Portland with the Kruse Grill around 1891. He married his second wife, Marion F. in Spokane, Washington in 1906 and divorced in 1908. He then purchased the Louvre restaurant, running it and Portland's Belvedere Hotel starting around 1907. He was married to his third wife, Marie E. Daggett, at the time. While in the process of setting up Hotel Carlton in 1911, he disappeared mysteriously in August 1911, days before a large payment was due to Gevurtz Furniture Company for the Carlton, who formed a company and took over the hotel lease. This was front-page news in the Oregonian; a month later, his wife sent people to Seattle to look for him, and the Oregonian described him as surfacing there with a young man. He suddenly reappeared on March 24, 1912, at the Carlton. In April 1912 his third wife was granted divorce from him, citing his \\"cruel and inhuman treatment\\" (a common grounds for divorce before no-fault divorce was legal). She described him as flirting with clientele at his restaurant in 1911 before his disappearance, and recounted that he was first in Quebec, then she sent a stepson (from his previous marriage) to Europe and found him in Germany. He stated his wife had died and he had retired. He then traveled through Europe (Monte Carlo, Naples, Rome), before suddenly reappearing. The Louvre was described as having an \\"immoral atmosphere\\" and on a list of eight \\"gay refectories\\" in Portland in 1911 by a local judge. It had a mens-only dining room. By 1912 it was linked to the clique, especially Kruse and Rig√≥. Kruse then closed the Louve and opened the Rainbow Grill in October 1913, which advertised \\"fat, juicy, delicious\\" oysters and a \\"Special Men's Grill\\" with meat of the diner's choosing. It closed in June 1915. =Gypsy Rig√≥= The clique also exposed Hungarian violinist popular in Portland, Rig√≥ Jancsi (known as \\"Gypsy\\" Rig√≥), described by The Oregonian as \\"violin virtuoso, gipsy of romance, gay Lothario.\\" He had played at the Louvre, perhaps starting in 1909, then was caught in the clique in the November 1912 events. Rig√≥ had previously been embroiled in scandal, eloping with Clara Ward, Princesse de Caraman-Chimay despite still being married to her first husband. The marriage didn't last, as Rig√≥ continued with his \\"insatiable and well-publicized appetite for women\\". This also helped clear him of the vice charges. = Edward McAllister = One of the most prominent members of the vice clique was Edward Stonewall Jackson McAllister, a Portland attorney, Progressive activist, leader in the state Democratic Party, and friend of William Simon U'Ren and C.E.S. Wood. During his trial, The Morning Oregonian would report that he was charged with committing an \\"immoral act.\\" According to the written opinion in State v. McAllister, 67 Or 480, 136 P 354, McAllister was charged with committing sodomy with 30 year old \\"boy victim\\" Roy Kadel (1882-1934) on , in McAllister's law office in downtown Portland. The indictment merely stated that his charge was \\"commit[ting] the crime against nature,\\" which was \\"too well understood and too disgusting to be herein more fully set forth.\\" But Oregon Supreme Court justice Charles McNary, in his dissent in McAllister, shed more light on the matter: A warrant for McAllister's arrest was issued . According to a contemporary news report in The Morning Oregonian, he was in Marshfield (now called Coos Bay) on that day, \\"taking depositions in a legal case.\\" Furthermore, he \\"was incensed when he heard the nature of the charge that had been lodged against him\\" and professed his innocence. He promised to return to Portland to face charges, but on , he was arrested on a southbound train at the Medford train station, near the California state line. He denied his identity, but several people in Medford recognized him.Boag, p. 177. He claimed he was headed to Ashland to meet with his law partner, but \\"authorities believe[d] he was trying to leave the state.\\" In McAllister's trial, Judge John P. Kavanaugh permitted testimony of acts of sodomy allegedly committed by McAllister with people other than Kadel, \\"for the purpose of showing mental disposition and casting light on the probability of the committal of the act actually charged.\\" Men testified he was known as \\"Mother McAllister\\" at Lownsdale Square, a gay cruising site. The defense argued that these testimonies infringed upon McAllister's constitutional rights. In charging the jury, Kavanaugh gave the following instruction: The defense would later argue on appeal, successfully, that Kavanaugh made a prejudicial error in giving his personal opinion to the jury rather than stating only matters of law. McAllister made a closing argument for the defense on his own behalf, described as \\"an eloquent plea\\", wherein \\"he charged that he [was] the victim of a conspiracy.\\" On , the jury convicted him, but recommended \\"leniency in punishment.\\" On , he was sentenced to one to five years in the state penitentiary, the maximum sentence called for by statute. Notice of appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court was immediately filed. =Others= Others associated with the clique included William H. Allen, who attempted to commit suicide with chloroform at the YMCA following the exposure, Horace Tabb, physician Harry Start (and witness Robert Ray), clerk and bookkeeper Edward Wedemeyer, George Birdseye, Fred A. Clark, Alonzo \\"Billy\\" E. Ream (1856-1930), Earle Van Hulen, Fred Rodby, George Parker, Earl Taylor, Kenneth Hollister, Will Phelps, Horace Tabb (at the Multnomah Hotel) and Lionel Deane. Claude Bronner and Nathan Healy lived with each other at 1731 S.W. Taylor; Healy turned on Bronner, who served time. John Moffitt, a photographer, was caught in the scandal and then advertised his services as \\"Photographer of Men\\".  Legislative response  Walter Lafferty, Portland's U.S. Representative, vowed to bring the scandal to Washington's attention, though his efforts were short- lived.Boag, pp. 185‚Äì86. The Oregon state legislature responded to the scandal by amending the state's sodomy law via House Bill 145 (1913). The law was clarified and broadened to include \\"any act or practice of sexual perversity,\\" including fellatio. At the time, courts had previously ruled that sodomy laws similar to Oregon's did not cover oral sex, and it was believed that convictions based on oral rather than anal sex acts might be reversed. Also under H.B. 145, the maximum sentence for sodomy in the state penitentiary was tripled, from five years to fifteen. As urged by Governor Oswald West, the legislature also passed H.B. 69 (1913), a law to authorize sterilization of \\"sexual perverts\\" and \\"moral degenerates,\\" which were defined as \\"those addicted to the practice of sodomy or the crime against nature, or to other gross, bestial and perverted sexual habits and practices prohibited by statute.\\"Boag, p. 210. People opposed to sterilization, including Catholic clergymen and reformers such as William Simon U'Ren, formed the Anti- Sterilization League and successfully forced a referendum on this legislation. Oregon voters repealed it by a vote of 56 percent to 44 in November 1913. However, the legislature passed a similar law in 1917.  Action by the Oregon Supreme Court  The three men who were sentenced to the state penitentiary appealed their convictions ‚Äî Harry Start, Edward Wedemeyer, and Edward McAllister. The Oregon Supreme Court first heard Start's case in May 1913 and reversed the conviction in State v. Start, 65 Or 178, 132 P 512 (1913), finding that the trial judge had allowed extraneous testimony that possibly prejudiced the jury. Wedemeyer's suit was also reversed around that time. McAllister's convictions were reversed on the same grounds in November 1913. Justice Charles McNary, a future U.S. Senator, was a new court justice by the time McAllister's appeal was heard. McNary wrote the dissent for McAllister's case, which was emotionally charged and \\"revealed a deeply seated personal discomfort with same-sex eroticism.\\" Days later McAllister was expelled from the Multnomah Bar Association. In 2000, over 74 years after his death, he was reinstated to the Bar. Notably, these convictions were not reversed on the basis that oral sex was not covered under Oregon's sodomy law, as the legislature feared the court might rule. In fact, despite legislation previous to Start ensuring that fellatio counted as a \\"crime against nature,\\" the court ruled that this was necessarily true because, among other reasons, the mouth and anus are both openings of the alimentary canal and therefore equally unsuited to sexual intercourse.Boag, pp. 204‚Äì5.

He was the son of theater manager Thomas B. MacDonough and actress/author Laura Don. Glen MacDonough married Margaret Jefferson in 1896 in Buzzard's Bay, Massachusetts. Biography MacDonough was born in Brooklyn, New York. He is best-remembered today as the librettist of Victor Herbert's operetta, Babes in Toyland (1903). MacDonough started out as a feature/human interest journalist in New York City, and according to one source (Atlanta Constitution, February 4, 1894), \\"...four years ago [MacDonough] was a reporter earning 15 to 20 dollars a week...but was rapidly advanced in salary and prominence. In one year on the New York Advertiser, he wrote 1,008 short stories...He [then] determined to abandon journalism and turn to the drama for a livelihood...\\" The Prodigal Father (1892) is MacDonough's first work that received any note in reviews of the day. It was a comedy with songs, a form generally called \\"musical extravaganzas\\" at the time. His second work, The Algerian (1893), was a collaboration with prominent songwriter Reginald DeKoven. In the 1890s he devoted much time to writing farces and comedies or the book and song lyrics to a string of musical comedies. These musical comedies include Miss Dynamite (1894) and Delmonico's at 6 (1895). MacDonough's name is associated with more than two dozen plays and musical works. Most of them have become obscure with the passage of time, but some‚Äîbesides Babes in Toyland‚Äîare worthy of mention and present certain points of historical interest.About 30 of MacDonough's works are listed in the internet Broadway data base at http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=5921. That is: He wrote the lyrics for the operetta, Chris and the Wonderful Lamp (1899), with music by march king John Philip Sousa, a work that undergoes periodic revival even today. MacDonough was also one of the many lyricists called to help out in the first musical production of L. Frank Baum's The Wizard of Oz (1902). Between 1896 and 1909, MacDonough collaborated with Victor Herbert on four other operettas besides Babes in Toyland: The Gold Bug (1896), It Happened in Nordland (1905), Wonderland (1905), and Algeria (1908, revised in 1909 as The Rose of Algeria). MacDonough was also the American adapter of Johann Strauss' last work, Vienna Life (1901), and of Franz Leh√°r's The Count of Luxembourg (1912). In 1909 he wrote the book for The Midnight Sons. He was one of the nine founding members of ASCAP in 1914. Glen MacDonough wrote continuously until the year before his death in Stamford, Connecticut, on March 30, 1924. His last work was in 1923, Within Four Walls, a play. See also * Anna Alice Chapin References Sources * Hischak, Thomas S. The Oxford Companion to the American Musical: Theatre, Film, and Television.

The basin flows through the states of Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, and Mexico. The river flows through the Sierra Madre del Sur, and empties into the Pacific Ocean at Mangrove Point, adjacent to the city of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Michoac√°n. Several rapids along the course of the Balsas River limit its navigability and thus the river has been largely used for generation of hydroelectric power, flood control and irrigation. History The Balsas River valley was possibly one of the earliest maize growing sites in Mexico, dating from around 9200 years ago. Though it is known that successive communities of Yop, Coixica, Matlatzinca (Chontal), Tlahuica and Xochimilca with Nahua succeeding in the end have lived in the region, archeological excavations in the area have yet to establish the hierarchical succession of the various communities. During the period of 1300-1500 CE the region between the lower Balsas river valley and the Lerma-Santiago River fell under control of the Tarascan-Pur√©pecha Empire. According to the 1980 Census, 47,000 people lived along the Balsas river banks, spread over 37 communities, within the six municipalities of the region. Nahua peoples constitute 47% of the population, 15% are indigenous people (speaking four different languages), other large communities are Mixtec (23%) and Tlapanec (19%), and the balance 4% are Amuzgo. The population increased to 60,000 in the 1990s. The communities, while retaining their individualities, show close linguistic, kinship, and cultural relationships - revealed, for example, when they perform the rituals of patronal feasts. Geography and climate Balsas River basin The upper Balsas River basin includes the State of Puebla, the States of Mexico, Morelos, and the Guerrero Mountain Zone, as well as several river systems of the Mesa Central plateau. The main system is of the Tlapanec River, with tributaries originating in the mountains such as the Oaxaca Mixteca. It is joined by the Amacuzac River fed by streams around Xonacantapec volcano and by the San Jeronimo and Chontalcoatlan rivers. The last two rivers originate around Popocatepetl volcano and flow through the State of Morelos. With a length of some the Balsas River is one of Mexico's longest rivers. It originates at the confluence of the San Martin and Zahuapan Rivers as Atoyac River in the state of Puebla. From here it flows south-west and then westward, into a depression through the state of Guerrero, and discharges into the Pacific Ocean at . The climate of the basin varies from temperate to subtropical with mean annual temperatures between 12.5 and 28 ¬∞C. Rainfall in the basin is highly seasonal and some 90% of annual precipitation occurs between May and September, with 546 mm recorded in the arid areas of the valley and 1000‚Äì1600 mm further upstream in the highland lakes area. River basin development The river at Coyuca de Catal√°n The Balsas River basin has witnessed much economic development. Through building dams these activities aimed at irrigation, generation of electricity, and improving agriculture and living conditions of indigenous people, mainly the Nahuas who form the majority group. Seven hydropower projects are envisaged on the Balsas River. The two major projects are the La Villita and El Infiernello (in Michoacan). The Carlos Ramirez Ulloa (El Caracol) project is being developed in the Guerrero and four others are planned for the future. =River Basin Councils= Water management has received due attention of the Government of Mexico over the past several decades. It included more efficient water use and aimed to meet water supply needs of the major cities in Mexico. The Tepalcatepec Commission was established in 1947 under the Ministry of Water Resources (one of the three commissions established initially) for the Balsas River development. In 1960, it was subordinated to the Balsas River Commission. Its tasks included planning, design, coordination and implementation of irrigation projects, flood control and hydropower generation, covering rural and urban development and health and communications aspects. Following the enactment of a new Water Law in the country, a Master Plan was developed in 1975 covering 13 hydrological regions (102 subregions). River Basin Councils were established, and 25 are currently in position out of the 26 planned. The Balsas River has a discharge of 15‚Äì17 m3/s during the lean flow season. The steep slope of the river in a stretch of 30 km creates an elevation difference of 1200 m, providing excellent opportunities for hydropower development. Initially, 120 MW of power was generated at the power station at La Villita. This 336 MW station was built in the state of Michoacan, near the Pacific Coast. Another Balsas River project planned was the El Infiernillo; it became operational in 1964 and has an installed capacity of 1,120 MW. El Infiernillo Dam is a 149 m rockfill embankment dam. =Agriculture= Agriculture in the basin has a rich history of over 9000 years, with an impressive transformation from the stage of unwelcome grass to high-yield maize fields. =Irrigation and hydroelectric power generation= Two dams on the river provide for irrigation and power generation. The water stored by the dam built above Tierra Caliente is utilized for growth of cotton and rice. The Balsas River basin was first considered for hydropower development in the 1940s. The basin has an area of 105,900 km2, and the two projects implemented here are the La Villita and El Infiernello (both in Michoacan). The El Infiernillo Dam is a 149 m rock fill embankment dam with a narrow central core. It is located on the Balsas River about southwest of Mexico City. Its height is about 148 m, crest length is 344 m, and the base width from the upstream toe to the downstream toe is 570 m. The reservoir has a storage capacity of 7,090 million m3. This is the largest hydropower project in Mexico which is also expected to reduce the floods in the area. La-Villita is an earth-cum-rock fill dam with a crest length of 320 m, a height of 60 m, and a power generation capacity of 300 MW. This was the first dam built on the Balsas River. It is located 15 km from the Pacific Ocean. Both dams have a solid structure and withstood well the five earthquakes of the magnitude up to 8.1 which occurred after their construction. =Transbasin water transfer= A project has been implemented to redirect some water from the Balsas River basin to the Lerma River Basin and the Valley of Mexico. It aimed to meet the growing drinking-water needs of Mexico City, which is about 130 km from the basin. Such transfers are expected to create water-sharing disputes among the basin states in the future. =Navigational studies= The navigation of this river by shallow-draft steamers was initially promoted for the development of the Guerrero area, and in 1911 a new concession was given by the Government of Mexico for this purpose. The proposal was to use the river for passengers and freight from the point of crossing of the Acapulco Trail to the Pacific Ocean, over the river length of about 300 miles. Initially a 25-foot boat was commissioned at Balsas railroad bridge station by Gullermo Niven, a business man in Mexico City who set out to establish its feasibility in November/December 1911. He had carried recommendation letters from President Madero of Mexico to important persons in towns and villages on the way. On this exploration he was accompanied by 11 people, including two river navigation experts and Fred Macfarlene, a California financier. The exploration lasted 22 days from the time of its departure till the return of the team back to Mexico City via Manzanillo on the steamboat S.S. Ram√≥n Corral which picked the exploration party at the last point of their journey at Orilla. During this period many events happened en route due to rebel activities, but the navigation itself was fairly smooth except for an encounter with a rock outcrop in the middle of a narrow section of the river where the boat overturned, injuring two people. While the river was proven navigable, investments to develop the facilities did not happen immediately due to the rebel activities in the area. Maize domestication Balsas Valley is known as the cradle of the original maize domestication. Archaeologist Richard MacNeish originally pointed out the importance of the Valley of Tehuac√°n, part of which also belongs to the Balsas valley, for maize domestication. He found over 10,000 teosinte cobs in the Coxcatlan Cave. Later, in 1989, the early date was confirmed by testing.Long, Austin, Bruce F. Benz, Douglas J. Donahue, AJ T. Jull, and Lawrence J. Toolin. First direct AMS dates on early maize from Tehuac√°n, Mexico. Radiocarbon 31, no. 3 (1989): 1035-1040. Maize samples from Cueva San Marcos, and Cueva Coxcatlan in Tehuacan neighborhood had been tested. The oldest dates were 4700 BP (uncalibrated) or 3600 BC (calibrated). Balsas River valley continues downstream into Guerrero state. There are also very early maize sites there, which attracted attention more recently. Recent research supports Balsas River valley as the first place in the world where maize was domesticated about 9000 years ago. The so-called \\"Balsas teosinte\\", now considered to be the direct predecessor of maize, grows mostly in the middle part of the Balsas Valley at this time. In the past, it may have grown in other parts of this valley, as palaeoclimatology studies show. In particular, the Xihuatoxtla Shelter, located in Iguala valley, provides the best stratigraphy. Recent debates among scientists center on where exactly in the Balsas River valley this type of teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) grew in times past, when corn was domesticated. Arts and crafts During the Pur√©pecha period, the people of the valley created many items of red-slipped buff-colored pottery, painted in white, cream, or red and made many ceramic pipes and tools using bronze alloys. The indigenous Amerindians inhabiting the Balsas River valley are noted for their bark paintings, often depicting flowers and wildlife.

Another song \\"The Funeral\\" from Band of Horses is not in the soundtrack album, but is used in the end of the trailer. Development Rahman collaborated with Danny Boyle for the second time. Their previous association, Slumdog Millionaire was a great critical and commercial success to Rahman, who was described by Time magazine as India's most prominent movie songwriter, in 2005.Corliss, Richard. (1 January 2005). That Old Feeling: Isn't It Rahmantic? Time magazine. Retrieved on 25 May 2008. After the scripting finished, Boyle handed over the script to Rahman, who says when he first got the script and the screenplay, even before the shoot, some kind of sounds came into his mind and he put some stuff down and sent it to Boyle when he was cutting the movie. Rahman wanted the score to feel very much like something the cinematic Ralston might be listening to, a mix of heavily layered acoustic and electric guitars, brightened with digital effects. About the selection of guitar as the major instrument, Rahman says: Rahman says that he was able to complete the score within a short period of three to four weeks. After completing the score, when asked about the scoring experience and challenges, Rahman said: Reception The soundtrack received generally favourable critical reviews. Philip French of The Observer commented that \\"The music is subtly varied; the soundtrack makes admirable use of silence and natural sound.\\" Sarah Kurchak of ChartAttack reviewed the music saying \\"There's something about the way Danny Boyle uses popular music in his films that's really exciting for anyone who genuinely cares about the medium. Plenty of directors are good with a score, and he's no slouch in that department, but the use of songs is a different beast. In both score and songs, Boyle seems to have an inherent ability to understand the moods and emotions music can inspire in people and uses it to augment his storytelling.\\" The soundtrack was rated five out of five in the review by Danny Graydon of Empire magazine. His review reads: \\"Following their Oscar-winning collaboration on Slumdog Millionaire, A. R. Rahman provides Danny Boyle‚Äôs tale of a mountaineer in dire straits with an affecting core of slow-burn, reflective cues that ultimately penetrate in a big way, supported by a typically eclectic array of exterior tracks from the likes of Free Blood, Bill Withers and, most effectively, Sigur R√≥s. Rahman‚Äôs nine cues are anchored on acoustic guitar and generate a suitably meditative tone, augmented by ethnic pipes (Acid Darbari) and ethereal vocals (R. I. P.). Rahman‚Äôs collaboration with singer Dido, If I Rise, closes proceedings with a cathartic and quietly optimistic tone which almost prompts a tear.\\" Margaret Wappler, in the review published in Los Angeles Times, said that \\"In his last movie, Slumdog Millionaire, director Danny Boyle showed a sophisticated sense of how music and image can intertwine and intensify each other. With his latest, 127 Hours, he proves his skill again, reenlisting composer A.R. Rahman, who won two Academy Awards for his racing, kinetic score to Boyle's violent fairy tale set in Mumbai, India.\\" Daniel Schweiger of Film Music Magazine said that \\"Danny Boyle and A.R. Rahman are going for a far more interior moment of transcendence, one that tells us the often-awful fight for life is more than worth it- especially in this haunting fever dream that take a filmmaker and musician to new heights while pondering their way out of a man's darkest hours.\\" The review published by Christian Clemmensen at Filmtracks commented that \\"Whether or not you can stomach this film or its equally challenging album, the music serves as even more evidence that the diversity of Rahman's talents can compete favourably in an otherwise arguably stale film scoring environment in the United States.\\" Jonathan Broxton of Movie Music UK gave a favourable review and called the score an \\"unconventional one\\". He also praised Rahman for his ability to score in multiple genres. Director Shekhar Kapur, after a special screening of the movie, commented through Twitter that \\"Rahman's score adds depth to Danny Boyle's deft and energetic direction in 127 hours. Rahman certainly deserves another Oscar for 127 hours, Danny Boyle and Rahman are proving to be a great combination.\\" Aron Ralston, on whom the movie is based, praised Rahman for the music and posted a hand-written note on Facebook and Twitter, which reads: Awards and nominations * Nominated ‚Äì Academy Award for Best Original Score * Nominated ‚Äì Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"If I Rise\\" * Nominated ‚Äì Alliance of Women Film Journalists Award for Best Score * Nominated ‚Äì BAFTA Award for Best Film Music * Won ‚Äì Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song for \\"If I Rise\\" * Nominated ‚Äì Central Ohio Film Critics Association Award for Best Score * Won ‚Äì Denver Film Critics Society for Best Song for \\"If I Rise\\" * Nominated ‚Äì Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score * Nominated ‚Äì Houston Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Score * Nominated ‚Äì Houston Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Song for \\"If I Rise\\" * Nominated ‚Äì Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Best Song for \\"If I Rise\\" * Nominated ‚Äì San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Score * Nominated ‚Äì Satellite Award for Best Original Score * Nominated ‚Äì Satellite Award for Best Original Song for \\"If I Rise\\" * Nominated ‚Äì Washington D.C.

In this wider context, one line of research strived to elucidate the dynamic signal processing of the participating neurons, such as muscle spindles, motoneurons and interneurons (particularly Renshaw cells) and their importance for oscillatory process such as tremor. Related issues were the plastic properties of such networks and their modulation by signals arising in the peripheral and central nervous system, specifically in the context of muscle fatigue. A related aspect of research concerned the origin of muscle pain and its effects on spinal neurons. In addition to experimental studies, computer modeling was used to unravel the properties of small neuronal networks, especially with respect to tremor.  Education  Between 1968 and 1974, he studied medicine at the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany, where he also earned his PhD and his Habilitation in Neurophysiology. He became Distinguished Professor in 1987.  List of major works  *Windhorst, U. and Schwestka, R.

At the time, he did not believe in the Nativity story, but said that since writing The Nativity, his opinion changed. He was asked to produce the series after discussing new projects with BBC Wales in Cardiff, but his meeting got mixed up with another, where they wanted to create a follow up to The Passion. Jordan was asked what he would do with the Nativity and he pitched what he called a \\"ridiculous notion\\" of a story centred on the Inn in Bethlehem, which he compared to the BBC 1980s sitcom 'Allo 'Allo!. Jordan forgot about the idea but received a telephone call from the BBC a week later asking him to produce a script. Filming lasted a month and took place in Ouarzazate, Morocco. Capaldi, Shepherd and Abili almost missed filming due to air travel disruption after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull in Iceland. Reception The first episode was watched by 5.21 million viewers, an audience share of 20.3%. Sam Wollaston of The Guardian praised the series, saying: \\"[W]hat is nice about this new telling of an old story: it will resonate, and it's relevant. It's very human, too, because that's what it's about, the characters and what happens to them and between them, rather than the message. In short, it's not preachy, and that's a relief.\\" References External links The Nativity at Temple Street Productions * 2010 British television series debuts 2010 British television series endings 2010s British drama television series 2010 Canadian television series debuts 2010 Canadian television series endings 2010s Canadian drama television series BBC television dramas Television series by Boat Rocker Media Nativity of Jesus on television English-language television shows ","title":"The Nativity (TV series)"},{"id":"30195963","text":"Laws and Regulations for Electronic Payment in Mauritius The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA).

It has complicated taxonomies.  Taxonomy  A specimen of Anthoceros agrestis in Schw√§bisch-Fr√§nkische Waldberge, Deutschland. This species of Anthoceros is known for having enzymes like cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.11), a cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylase. Cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H; EC 1.14.13.11) is one of the first known plant cytochrome P450 monooxygenasesRussell and Conn 1967, Russell 1971 and also one of the best-characterized cytochrome P450 hydroxylases from higher plants.Werck-Reichhardt 1995 Description Anthoceros agrestis grows as a thin, dark green, rosette-like thallus up to in diameter, superficially resembling a leafless liverwort. The surface is punctured with hollows containing the male organs. The spore-producing bodies lack a stalk or capsule but produce erect, cylindrical structures that turn black as they mature. They then split open to reveal the spore-bearing central spindle and release the black spores. Distribution and habitat This hornwort has a circum-boreal distribution across temperate Europe and North America. It is a lowland species found in moist soil in arable fields and ditches. It is listed as vulnerable in the Irish Red Data Book as it is known from fewer than five locations in the country. It occurs at a single location in Northern Ireland, in County Down, and because of its rarity there, it is listed as a Northern Ireland Priority Species.  Chemistry  Production of Rosmarinic acid and a rosmarinic acid 3'-O-beta-D-glucoside in suspension cultures of this hornwort was also discovered in 2005. Anthocerodiazonin, an alkaloid, was isolated from in vitro cultures of the species. Also, six glutamic acid amides, N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)-glutamic acid, N-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-glutamic acid, N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoyl)-glutamic acid, (E)-N-(isoferuloyl)-glutamic acid, (Z)-N-(isoferuloyl)-glutamic acid and (Z)-N-(p-coumaroyl)-glutamic acid were obtained as natural products.

It is home to many high tech industrial companies and warehouses. There used to be a prison complex called Kaki Bukit Centre, which was converted to a prison school in 2000, however it has since moved to Tanah Merah and the Acacia Welfare Home now stands in its place. On the south of Kaki Bukit is Jalan Tenaga and Jalan Damai neighbourhoods of Bedok Reservoir Road. Redevelopments are in the pipeline for Kaki Bukit beyond 2030 when Paya Lebar Airbase located just north of the estate relocates to Changi. Not only would land be freed up for use but building height restrictions, that are currently in place for safety reasons because the estate is directly aligned with the airbase runway, would also be lifted. Kaki Bukit is classified by Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) as a subzone under the planning area of Bedok, its boundaries differ from the constituency boundaries used by the Singapore Parliament. History The history of Kaki Bukit can be traced since the 1960s as an extension of the Jalan Eunos Malay Settlement. The name, Kaki Bukit translates to \\"Foothill\\" from Malay as the area was an upland area. Back then, it was filled with kampung houses and roads baring Malay names. Most of its residents were resettled from Kampong Glam and Bugis regions. By the 1980s, the Jalan Eunos Malay Settlement had been degazetted. The kampung houses were brought down, its residents compensated with newly built HDB flats in present-day Bedok Reservoir. Most of the old roads in the area were then removed and new roads running from Bedok Reservoir were built. The hilly incline of Kaki Bukit was also flattened for land reclamation of the East Coast area. Amenities There are limited amenities in Kaki Bukit with Kaki Bukit Amenity Centre and Kaki Bukit Recreation Centre providing several food options. There are more amenities located in the nearby Bedok Reservoir or Eunos estates. There are various dormitories located in the area too, to house foreign workers working nearby. The area falls under the jurisdiction of the Bedok Police Division and the 2nd Singapore Civil Defence Force DIV HQ. =Education= There are currently no public government schools in the area, although there used to be several that have since been defunct: * Hwa Ming Chinese School, c.1950 to c.1980, Paya Lebar Air Base now occupies the land it once stood on * Kaki Bukit Primary School/ Kaki Bukit English & Malay School, from 1962 to 1984, the Acacia Welfare Home now stands in its place, its name was changed to Bedok West Primary School during its move, it was then merged into Damai Primary School in 2015 * Kaki Bukit Secondary School, from 1965 to 1984, located formerly beside Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir, its name was changed to Bedok Town Secondary School during its move, it was then merged into Ping Yi Secondary School in 2016 * Kampong Melayu Malay Boys' School, from 1936 to 1979, formerly located north of Madrasah Al-Ridzwan * Kampong Melayu Malay Girls' School, from 1936 to 1979, formerly located north of Madrasah Al-Ridzwan * Madrasah Al-Ridzwan, till c.1985, formerly located north of Jalan Singa * Sin Sheng School, 1937 to c.1972, near where Eunos Mansion stands today =Transportation= MRT Kaki Bukit MRT Station which is part of the Downtown MRT line serves this vicinity. During the construction of the station, a section of Kaki Bukit Avenue 1 was closed from August 2011 to April 2016. Jalan Tenaga and Jalan Damai were widened due to this road closure to cope with traffic redirected towards them. Bus services plying along that stretch of road were also diverted accordingly for that period of time. Bus SBS Transit services, 5, 58, 59, 87 and Go-Ahead service 15 ply along Kaki Bukit Avenue 1, the only main road in Kaki Bukit. Bus service 137 is the only service that operates within the industrial part of the estate, but it does not bypass the Kaki Bukit MRT Station, which means commuters cannot make their last mile journey to the industrial estate via this MRT station. Road The Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) found north-west of Kaki Bukit has one exit (Exit 6) which leads to the estate. North and south bound, entrances and exits for KPE near Kaki Bukit are not adjacent to each other. Exit 9 of the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) which is found a short distance south of the estate leads towards the estate too. In addition, Bartley Road East that cuts through Kaki Bukit is part of a semi-expressway Outer Ring Road System that stretches from Queenstown to Tampines. Industries Aside from the high tech industrial companies and warehouses located at the industrial estate. The area is also home to many other industries including the automobile industry that cater to vehicle inspection, learning and maintenance. The SAF Driving School located in Kaki Bukit Camp together with the neighbouring Comfort Delgro Driving School in Ubi makes L-plate learning drivers a common sight in the area. Waterworks is also another important industry in the area. Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir is the main supplier of water in the east of Singapore, it receives its water from the PUB Bedok Waterworks which treats water collected from the nearby Bedok Reservoir. This service reservoir then stores and pumps the treated water to various neighbourhoods in the east. Incidents * On 19 April 2017, 13 foreigners were arrested by Police for vice related activities at the forested part of Kaki Bukit near Kaki Bukit Avenue 4, various charges including those such as wilful trespass on state land, offences under the Women‚Äôs Charter, suspected consumption of controlled drugs and offences under the Immigration Act, Chapter 133, were considered against those arrested.

The holder was until 1949 entitled to a seat in the States of Alderney, and between 1825 and 1949 was Leader of Alderney.  History  The Judge of Alderney is a legally qualified person appointed by the Crown to be chief judge of Alderney, sitting with the Jurats (lay judges) in cases heard there. The position is equivalent to that of a judge of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. Appeals from decisions of the court may be made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1825, the hereditary Governor of Alderney, John Le Mesurier III, returned his family's fiefdom over Alderney to the Crown in exchange for an annual pension. That office of governor being thus in effect abolished, the Judge of Alderney, as highest Crown appointment there, assumed the role of leader. During the Second World War, the Channel Islands were occupied by Nazi Germany, and the Judge, who had gone to England, was effectively replaced as leader of Alderney by Island Commandant Inselkommandant Alderney and a designated Sonderf√ºhrer von Alderney. After the war, less than 50% of Alderney's population returned, which led to the United Kingdom government proposing that Alderney become part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. In 1948, the States of Alderney and the States of Guernsey passed laws under which Alderney gave up sovereignty to Guernsey. It was also provided that the Judge of Alderney be replaced as Leader of Alderney by the democratically elected President of the States of Alderney, the role of Representative of the Crown being fulfilled by the Lieutenant-Governor of Guernsey.

Biography Louis was born at Philippsthal as the son of Landgrave William and his wife Ulrika Eleonora of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld. A prince of the family of the Landgraves of Hesse-Philippsthal, he fought for the Kingdom of Naples during the Napoleonic Wars. In the course of the War of the Third Coalition, he commanded the garrison of the fortress of Gaeta in the siege laid by the French in 1806, refusing to obey the order of the Neapolitan government to surrender it. His troops resisted for six months, until 18 July after Louis, while leading his men on the bastions, was wounded on 10 July and had to leave the fortress. Later, together with colonel Nunziante and lieutenant colonel Bardot, an expedition of 4,000 men who, in 1807, left Sicily to attempt the reconquest of the mainland of Naples. They were however defeated in the Battle of Mileto of 28 May 1807. After the death of his brother Charles in the siege of Frankfurt in 1793, Louis succeeded him as hereditary prince of the langraviate of Hesse-Philippsthal. When Louis died childless at Naples in 1816 (his only son had died in 1802, aged four), the title went to his brother Ernest Constantine.  Marriage and issue  Louis married on 21 January 1791 in Susteren to Countess Marie Franziska Berghe of Trips (1771‚Äì1805). His parents were unaware of this marriage and didn't recognize when they learned about it. Moreover, he had to resign from the Dutch army, as officers were not allowed to marry Catholics. Marie Franziska had connections, and managed to get her husband a position in the army of the Kingdom of Naples. After his death, she served as Mistress of the Robes at the court of Queen Maria Carolina.

Fons memorabilium universi (\\"Source of notable information about the universe\\") is an early encyclopedia, written in Latin by the Italian humanist Domenico Bandini of Arezzo (also given as Domenico di Bandino or Dominicus Bandinus, c. 1335 ‚Äì 1418). Planned to inform and edify educated men who lack other books, the work covered God and the natural world, as was common for encyclopedias of the time, but also added a voluminous last part dealing with man and historical figures, philosophy and history, theology, ethics, heretics and women. Bandini, a teacher of grammar and rhetoric who lived in Florence, Bologna, Citt√† di Castello and Arezzo, worked on the encyclopedia from before 1374 until his death in 1418. In Florence he was influenced by Coluccio Salutati, causing him to emphasize topics related to the classical antiquity in his work. Bandini's son Laurentius completed and published the work after Bandini's death and added an introductory apology, defending the work against criticism of style. At least 26 manuscripts survive, including one at Balliol College, of which digital photographs are available online, and two at the Vatican Library. Many of these contain only parts of the work. They all date from before 1460. The whole work consists of between two and five volumes, depending on writing style and size. The work was not very influential and was already almost forgotten in the . It was never printed, unlike the very successful encyclopedia De proprietatibus rerum by Bartholomeus Anglicus, from which Bandini had borrowed heavily. He also frequently cited the earlier works of Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder, Gaius Julius Solinus, Isidore of Seville and Hrabanus Maurus. The end of book 8 \\"on the planets\\" contains an unrelated interpolation praising two lawyers from Bologna. The paragraph has been interpreted as an advertisement inserted by the lawyers, either by having paid the scribes or by having worked as scribes themselves. Organization The work is organized in 5 parts (to reflect the five wounds of Christ), with each part divided into several books containing numerous cross references. Each of the 34 books covers one circle of topics. Some of these books consist of several introductory and systematical chapters, followed by an alphabetically ordered list of articles. This organization had been developed in the 13th century by Vincent of Beauvais in his Speculum naturale and had also been used by Bartholomaus Anglicus in his De proprietatibus rerum and by Thomas of Cantimpr√© in his Liber de natura rerum.

The relay began with four flames kindled on the highest peaks of the four nations of the United Kingdom, which were then brought to their respective capital cities for special events honouring the upcoming Games. For the relay proper, the four national flames were united at a ceremony in Stoke Mandeville in preparation for a final journey to London. Relay = Journey to Stoke Mandeville= The Paralympic torch relay began on 22 August. In a ceremony representing human endeavour, groups of disabled and non-disabled scouts kindled the four Paralympic flames on the highest peaks of each nation of the United Kingdom; Scafell Pike in England, Ben Nevis in Scotland, Slieve Donard in Northern Ireland, and Snowdon in Wales. The four flames were then brought down from each peak in lanterns. On 24 August the flames were used to light ceremonial cauldrons in their respective capital cities (London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff) during \\"Flame Festival\\" events. A total of 38 towns and cities also hosted \\"Flame Celebration\\" events over the bank holiday weekend, where community representatives collected a part of their nation's flame to bring back for their respective events.

On 28 August a ceremony was held at Stoke Mandeville Stadium, in honour of Stoke Mandeville's significance to the Paralympic movement, where the four national flames were united in a cauldron at precisely 8:12 pm (20:12) to form a single flame for the relay. The four flames were brought into the stadium by dignitaries, including English Charity Campaigner, TV Presenter And Former model Katie Piper (who began to campaign for burns victims after having acid thrown in her face in 2009 By Starting Her Own Charity The Katie Piper Foundation), former Paralympian Chris Channon, nominated as a Torchbearer for his work on the Pegasus 999 PIN Database, a project designed to make the emergency call system more accessible for disabled and vulnerable people and Scottish amateur boxer Jonjo Look (who had a leg amputated and replaced by a prosthesis following an accident filling a gas canister). The flame travelled a route to the Olympic Stadium in a 24-hour relay, with 580 torchbearers working in teams of five. It travelled through iconic areas of London such as Abbey Road and London Zoo. Poor weather caused a two-hour delay on the Wednesday before the Games; parts of the route were modified to help ensure it would reach the stadium in time, while a backup flame was taken straight to the stadium as a contingency. However, as the opening ceremony's parade of nations took longer than expected, the flame was able to arrive at Olympic Stadium in time. =End of relay= The final three torchbearers represented three generations of Paralympic athletes. The torch entered the Olympic Stadium via a zipline attached to ArcelorMittal Orbit, carried by Joe Townsend, a former Royal Marine with amputated legs. Townsend represented the future as an athlete planning to compete in 2016 Summer Paralympics. He passed the torch to David Clarke, long-time captain of Britain's Five-a-side football team, representing the present. With his guide, Clarke passed the torch to Margaret Maughan, the winner of Great Britain's first gold medal at the 1960 Summer Paralympics, representing the past. Route in the UK  The Torches  The Paralympic torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, who had also designed the Summer Olympic torch. It was intended to have a \\"modern\\" and \\"innovative\\" look, and was constructed with an aluminium alloy skin that is perforated to help with heat dissipation and grip. The torch also had a reflective finish, allowing it to match its surroundings and provide better visibility at night.

The castle is located on the Hill of San L√°zaro in a strategic location, dominating approaches to the city by land or sea. It was built by the Spanish during the colonial era. Construction began in the year 1536, and it was originally known as the Castillo de San L√°zaro, It was expanded in 1657. History The fortress was begun in 1536. It was significantly expanded in 1657. It was built in a triangular shape on top of the hill, with eight batteries and a garrison of 200 soldiers and 4 gunners. Its name was given in honour of Philip IV of Spain. Another expansion was made to the fortress in 1763 by Antonio de Ar√©valo. In the 1697 raid on Cartagena, during the War of the Grand Alliance, the castle fell to the French privateer Baron de Pointis. The castle was repaired by Jos√© de Herrera y Sotomayor in 1739. British Admiral Edward Vernon attacked the fortress in the 1741 Battle of Cartagena de Indias, an important conflict of the War of Jenkins' Ear. Vernon's forces were repelled by the Spanish admiral Blas de Lezo. During the Spanish American wars of independence by mid-1815 a large Spanish expeditionary force under Pablo Morillo had arrived in New Granada. Cartagena fell in December, and by May 1816 the royalists had control of all of New Granada. The castle Map of the tunnels Internal corridors of the castle. The fortification consists of a series of walls, wide at the base and narrow toward the parapet, forming a formidable pattern of bunkers. The batteries and parapets protect one another, so making it practically impossible to take a battery without taking the whole defence system. The castle is striking for its grand entrance and its complex maze of tunnels. It is the most formidable defensive complex of Spanish military architecture. It is 41 meters (135 ft.) above sea level. Key features include the triangular Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas, surrounded by the batteries de Santa Barbara, de San Carlos y Los Apostles, Del Hornabeque, de la Cruz, de la Redencion, and de San Lazaro. The combined 68 guns faced away from the city. Joining the Media Luna causeway was a caponniere. The San Lazaro battery's terreplein included aljibes, while channels and breakwaters dealt with rainwater. The main underground gallery runs along the perimeter of the complex at sea level. Chambers within it could be exploded preventing the advance of overhead attackers. Status and conservation The castle is well preserved. When it ceased to be used for military purposes, tropical vegetation covered the battlements and walls, and soil accumulated in the tunnels and trenches. In 1984, UNESCO listed the castle, with the historic centre of the city of Cartagena, as a World Heritage Site. Since 1990, the castle has served as a location for social and cultural events offered by the Colombian government in honour of foreign delegations at presidential summits, ministerial meetings, the Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (1995) and the Summit of the Rio Group (2000), among others.

He is best known for his solo career during which he released eleven studio albums, alongside various EPs, singles, and collaborative albums, including a 2012 release recorded with his live band billed as the Ty Segall Band and another from that same year with Tim Presley of White Fence. Segall is also a member of the bands Fuzz, Broken Bat, the CIA, G√òGGS, and Wasted Shirt, and is a former member of the Traditional Fools, Epsilons, Party Fowl, Sic Alps, and the Perverts. During live performances, Segall is currently backed by the Freedom Band, consisting of regular collaborators Mikal Cronin (bass), Charles Moothart (drums), and Emmett Kelly (guitar), playing alongside Ben Boye (piano) and Shannon Lay. His previous backing bands have been the Ty Segall Band, consisting of Cronin (bass), Moothart (guitar), and Emily Rose Epstein (drums), the Muggers, a high concept band formed in 2016 and consisting of Cronin (bass, sax), Kelly (guitar), Kyle Thomas (guitar) and Wand's Cory Hanson (keyboards, guitar) and Evan Burrows (drums), and the Sleeper Band, consisting of Sean Paul (guitar), Andrew Luttrell (bass) and Moothart (drums).  Early life  Segall is the adopted son of a Laguna Beach, California family; his father is a lawyer and his mother is an artist. Segall began surfing at age ten, although he was in high school when he became interested in music. He describes his teenage self as emotionally unstable, a \\"very existential eighteen-year-old drinker,\\" whose instability was temporarily mended by the escapism music provided him. During Segall's last two years at Laguna Beach High School, MTV filmed the reality series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County there. Segall blamed the show for driving away his hometown's unique culture of hippies, artists and surfers because \\"they can‚Äôt afford to live there now. And you can‚Äôt get any of that rad, grimy shit back.\\" Segall and his high school friend, Mikal Cronin parodied the TV show in a 2007 music video by their grunge band, Episilons. After high school, Segall attended the University of San Francisco where he received a degree in Media Studies. After graduating, he worked eight months constructing grow boxes for cannabis plants, but since then has been focused entirely on music. Recording career =Early career (2008‚Äì2011)= Segall began his recording career as a part-time musician in various underground bands in Orange County and the San Francisco Bay Area, before beginning a solo career in 2008. Segall's first solo release was the cassette Horn The Unicorn released on the Wizard Mountain label (later re-released by HBSP-2X on vinyl record). Around the same time, Wizard Mountain also released a split cassette featuring Segall and the band Superstitions entitled Halfnonagon. After Segall befriended John Dwyer, of Thee Oh Sees and Coachwhips, Dwyer offered to release Segall's debut solo album, Ty Segall (2008), on his label, Castle Face Records. The two became firm friends, with Segall noting: \\"The music community is amazing here, super-tight, and John Dwyer's like the Mayor of San Francisco. Come down here, you'll see him riding his bike, drinking a beer, and he'll probably take you out to get a taco. He's the nicest guy in the world.\\". In a recent interview, Larry Hardy, creator of In The Red Records, talked about the possibility of a band with Segall and Dwyer.Interview by Still in Rock.com Ty Segall was followed by a string of limited 7\\" singles and a split LP with the band Black Time. In 2009, Lemons was released by Goner Records to positive reviews. This release was followed by another string of successful and limited 7\\" singles and the LP Reverse Shark Attack, an album with longtime collaborator Mikal Cronin. The studio albums Melted and Goodbye Bread followed in 2010 and 2011 respectively. =Hair, Slaughterhouse and Twins (2012)= 2012 saw the release of three full-length albums by Segall: Hair, with White Fence, released in April; Slaughterhouse, recorded with his touring band and released June 26; as well as one solo album, Twins, released on October 9. This last album spawned two singles: \\"The Hill\\" and \\"Would You Be My Love?\\" When questioned about his LP Twins, Segall stated; \\"I want to do a total glam Stooges-meets-Hawkwind or Sabbath, something like that. I think that would be super fun. I want to throw people off. I want to make a really heavy record: evil, evil space rock. Put a little Satan in space and you got the sound.\\" =Fuzz, Sleeper and Manipulator (2013‚Äì2015)= Segall performing with Fuzz in 2015. In 2013, Segall, bandmate Charles Moothart and Roland Cosio formed a new hard rock outfit called Fuzz, releasing three 7\\" singles. A full- length album, titled Fuzz, was recorded in May and released on October 1, 2013. Previous to this release, Segall released a primarily acoustic solo album, Sleeper, in August. Largely influenced by the death of his father and subsequent estrangement from his mother, Sleeper received positive reviews from such media outlets as Pitchfork and Consequence of Sound. In November/December 2013, Segall performed at the final \\"holiday camp\\" edition of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Camber Sands, England, UK. In 2014, Segall released Manipulator, his first double LP, as well as his first to integrate some psych music. Segall toured in support of the release, with support from Wand, whom he had signed to his label In 2015, Segall produced the debut album by Peacers, featuring his former Sic Alps bandmate Mike Donovan. A new EP, Mr. Face, was released on Famous Class, and a second Fuzz album, II, was released in October 2015. =Emotional Mugger and The Muggers (2016)= In November 2015, Segall announced a new studio album, Emotional Mugger, by sending a VHS tape to Pitchfork. Subsequently a website was also created, www.emotionalmugger.com, that would feature a short video of Segall explaining the concept of emotional mugging and a video of Segall and his band wearing baby masks and playing a live version of a song from the new album. This latter video also offered a hotline number to call. The number, 1-800-281-2968, features a brief message from Segall. The video also introduces The Muggers, which, upon the album's release, Segall formed as a backing band. The band consisted of Mikal Cronin (bass, sax), Kyle Thomas (guitar), Emmett Kelly (guitar), and Wand's Cory Hanson (keyboards, guitar) and Evan Burrows (drums). During live performances, Segall adopted the name of Sloppo while wearing a baby mask. Still in Rock described this LP as being Segall's first experimental rock album.Ty Segall ‚Äì Emotional Mugger ‚ÄúStill in Rock‚Äù =Ty Segall, Freedom's Goblin and The Freedom Band (2017‚Äìpresent)= In November 2016, Segall announced the release of his ninth studio album, Ty Segall. The album was to be his second self-titled release, following the release of his eponymously titled debut album in 2008. It was preceded by the release of the single \\"Orange Color Queen\\" in November 2016. Later, the song \\"Break A Guitar\\" was released to streaming platforms on January 19, 2017. Also following the album's release, Segall began touring with the backing band that recorded the album, which was now named The Freedom Band. In the album, Segall displays his ability to play the full repertoire of rock; in one album he goes from T. Rex style glam rock, to Bob Dylan-esque country rock, to the breadth and social commentary of Pink Floyd, to hardcore punk, to a jam band sound. Segall describes the record as a \\"song album\\"‚Äîone without a singular concept or sound. The ten-minute-long centerpiece of the album is \\"Warm Hands (Freedom Returned)\\", which starts with Segall's characteristic punk-inspired thrashing guitar, but becomes open and spacey around the five-minute mark, before reprising the melody from \\"Freedom\\" (the second track on the album). Comparisons have been drawn between this most recent album and Segall's 2012 release Twins, which was also a compilation of Segall's various influences and styles up to that point in his career. Segall released the album Freedom's Goblin on January 26, 2018. Segall also composed the theme music for three Comedy Central television programs, The Opposition with Jordan Klepper (2017), and Corporate (2018), and Klepper. =2020 and beyond= At the outset of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic outbreak in the United States and Canada, Segall released Segall Smeagol, a set of covers of six tracks from Harry Nilsson's groundbreaking album Nilsson Schmilsson, on Bandcamp. The album is free of charge to download. Musical style and equipment Segall's music has been described as garage rock, garage rock revival, lo-fi, indie rock and psychedelic rock. Segall has stated in interviews that his favorite band of all time is Hawkwind. Notable glam rockers David Bowie and Marc Bolan heavily influenced Segall's early career, as well as heavy rock and punk bands such as Black Sabbath, Kiss, The Stooges, and Black Flag (especially in the Ty Segall Band). However, over time Segall's output has gotten mellower on albums such as Goodbye Bread and Sleeper, taking cues from Neil Young, The Byrds, The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band, The Beatles (even being compared to John Lennon vocally on some of his albums), and early T. Rex (when they were known as Tyrannosaurus Rex) and Grateful Dead. A big source of his inspiration also comes from the San Francisco garage and indie rock scenes, from which he has named bands such as Thee Oh Sees (being personal friends with frontman John Dwyer), Sic Alps, and White Fence (both of which last two bands he has collaborated with) as inspirations. Throughout his career, Segall has used a variety of vintage guitars, most notably a 1966 Fender Mustang, a 1969 Gibson Les Paul, and a black 1977 Travis Bean TB1000s. He has mostly used Fender amplifiers, preferring silverface Twin Reverbs, Quad Reverbs, Super Reverbs, and Super Six Reverbs. His main and sometimes only pedal is a Death By Audio Fuzz War pedal. Death By Audio actually manufactured a signature reverb pedal inspired by him, the Death by Audio Sunshine Reverberation Pedal, in 2013. Only 100 were manufactured. In 2014, he began playing a sunburst Gibson Les Paul on his tour supporting his then-new album Manipulator. His main amplifier is a '70s Fender Quad Reverb; he sometimes uses Music Man HD amplifiers. He also uses a Gibson EB-0. For drums, his main set is a vintage Ludwig and white marine pearl. GOD? Records Segall has his own record label imprint on Drag City called GOD? Records. In 2014, Segall signed fellow-garage rock act Wand to the label and subsequently invited them to join him on tour.

Âë™„Çè„Çå„ÅóÂÆùÁü≥ (Norowareshi Houseki - The Cursed Jewel) There existed a 30-carat diamond named \\"Reine Mich√®le\\" (Queen of Death Mich√®le). This jewel always curse its owner by evoking human greed. It had passed through countless owners and being stolen countless times. There was a man named Hiver, presumably related to Hiver Laurant. He left home to the mines in order to find something valuable enough for his sister, No√´l to be wed. But, right when Hiver dug up the diamond, while holding the jewel in his hands and trembling in happiness, he was hit over the head by the owner of the mine. He died immediately, and the mining crew killed each other for the diamond. No√´l, seemingly unaware of what happened, refused to marry just to wait for her brother, who would never again have a chance to come back. 5. ÊòüÂ±ë„ÅÆÈù©Á¥ê (Hoshikuzu no Kawahimo - The Leash of Stardust) Etoile (whose name means \\"star\\" in French) is a blind little girl. One day, her father brought home a black dog named Pleut (\\"it's raining\\" in French), who would be her lifetime friend (it's a kind of guide dog for blind people). They lived together happily as a real family till one day, Pleut became so old, weak and couldn't even move. Etoile cried so much because she knew it was dying, but from Pleut's frozen cold body she could feel a warmth. She recognized that the dog was pregnant, and would soon give birth to many more little puppies. 6. Á∑ãËâ≤„ÅÆÈ¢®Ëªä (Hiiro no Fuusha - The Scarlet Windmill) A couple was escaping from their home, ravaged by war. Quickly pursued, they ran into the forest. The pursuers were able to catch up to them and take the girl. The boy ran away without her, her frightened eyes burning into his memory. The boy, regretting his actions, promises to stay by her side to the end if they were to be reborn. While it is never stated who the boy is, it is implied that he is a younger Laurencin, the man who would come and kill the red haired Laurant. 7. Â§©‰Ωø„ÅÆÂΩ´ÂÉè (Tenshi no Chouzou - The Sculpture of Angel) Auguste Laurant is a famous artisan, and his last creation was an angel sculpture. He took inspiration from his deceased wife who had died when giving birth to their child. Auguste couldn't overcome such great loss, that's why he sent his child into an orphanage and sworn that they would never meet again. But in the end he couldn't take it, and he often secretly entered the orphanage just to be able to hear the innocent laughters of the children. 8. Áæé„Åó„Åç„ÇÇ„ÅÆ (Utsukushiki Mono - Beautiful Things) A girl was singing about her deceased little brother. According to her singing, the meaning of \\"being born\\" is to come to this world to search for \\"beauty\\" and the meaning of \\"death\\" is also to depart to another world to search for \\"beauty.\\" The \\"beauty\\" she was singing is the peaceful sceneries of her village, and the colors of each season that passed by. Her pure singing voice and her bright harmonica sound would forever continue her little brother's song. The deceased little brother's name is Laurant. 9. Ê≠ì„Å≥„Å®ÂìÄ„Åó„Åø„ÅÆËë°ËêÑÈÖí (Yorokobi to Kanashimi no Budoushu - The Wine of Joy and Sadness) Loraine de Saint-Laurent is the daughter of a noble family traditionally manufacturing grape wine. However, she fell in love with a servant whose name she didn't even know. Meanwhile, her stepmother only cared about fashions and banquets and didn't care at all about the family's future. To ensure the family's future, Loraine's father arranged a marriage between her and an even richer family. Unable to stand that, Loraine and her servant arranged an escape but they were caught. The servant was killed right away. Back at home, Loraine escaped again, and on the way she found the person who killed her lover, and killed him. Since then, she spent the rest of her life taking care of the grape trees just like what her loved servant had done. 10. ÈªÑÊòè„ÅÆË≥¢ËÄÖ (Tasogare no Kenja - The Sage of Twilight) This song is about an encounter between Chloe, a young woman troubled over deciding whether or not to give birth, and a mysterious nobleman named \\"Savant\\" (\\"sage\\" in French). Savant's real name was Christophe Jean-Jacques Saint-Laurent. He gave her many hard-to- understand advices that were as mysterious as himself. Those advices are the key to solve Roman's \\"Dark\\" side. Could it be because twilight is the moment between Light and Darkness, and thus Savant is a wise man who stands in this interval and understands everything about all Roman regardless of \\"Light\\" and \\"Dark\\" sides? \\"As the \\"Windmill\\" keeps revolving, quietly weaving \\"Beautiful\\" illusions Under the flickering \\"Flame\\" those fools who extended their \\"Arms\\" Trying to seize the \\"Jewel\\" but then kept wandering in the interval of \\"Morning and Night\\" Even though the \\"Stardust\\" glitters, the \\"Wine\\" continues to invoke people into its intoxicated dream From the cage in which the \\"Sage\\" escapes, the true meaning of the \\"Message\\" is being questioned As the \\"Angel\\" sings farewell song, the Fifth Roman will be explained by the \\"Horizon\\"\\" 11. ÔºëÔºëÊñáÂ≠ó„ÅÆ‰ºùË®Ä (11 Moji no Dengon - The 11-letter Message) There are two explanations for this song. It could be about a mother singing for her deceased son, or about a mother who is already dead after giving birth to her son. Nevertheless, the setting is the same - a cold Winter morning (\\"Hiver\\" means \\"Winter\\" in French). This song is the key to solve Roman's \\"Light\\" side.

Although the usual English translation of H√ºtte is \\"hut\\", most of them are substantial buildings designed to accommodate and feed significant numbers of hikers and climbers and to withstand harsh high alpine conditions for decades.  Purpose and facilities  They provide hikers and climbers with accommodation and shelter, mainly in the Alpine region. The greater number of these huts are managed, several are only suitable for those able to be self-contained. Although fundamentally all those involved in mountain activities have access to the huts, preferential service is given to members of the Alpine clubs. These include: reduced accommodation rates, mountaineer's meals, hot water for tea, the right to provide one's own food and alcohol-free drink (sometimes for a nominal fee). For unmanaged huts members can obtain a master key (alpine club key, Universalschl√ºssel or AV-Schl√ºssel) for a deposit from the local alpine branch. Sleeping accommodation may consist of beds, a mattress room (Matratzenlager) and emergency beds or shakedowns.  Reciprocal agreement between clubs  The larger alpine clubs in Europe have a multilateral agreement to treat members of other clubs as their own members at their club's huts (reciprocal rights). These clubs include: the German and Austrian Alpine Clubs, the Club Alpin Fran√ßais, the Club Alpino Italiano, the Swiss Alpine Club and the Federaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Montanismo as well as several smaller clubs.  Categories  The German and Austrian Alpine Clubs as well as other alpine clubs divide their mountain huts into 3 categories based on situation and facilities as follows: * Category I: these huts are usually situated at least 1 hour's walk from road transport or the nearest road and may have basic facilities. Some are tiny shelters near the summit of a mountain. In larger huts food and beverages may be served. Members have priority only in allocation of accommodation and claim a minimum discount of 50%. * Category II: located in popular areas; and usually accessible by road or cableway, these huts are often open throughout the year. With better facilities and more varied catering than category I huts, members have a minimum discount of 30%. * Category III: primarily used by day visitors and accessible by car or cableway. These huts are almost akin to hotels, offering a minimum overnight discount of 10% to alpine club members.Reynolds, Kev (2009). Walking in Austria, 1st ed., Cicerone, Milnthorpe,p.27. .  Private huts  In addition to the alpine club huts there is also a large number of alpine accommodation huts run by private individuals. These are listed in the List of mountain huts in the Alps.  North America  The Alpine Club of Canada (ACC) is Canada's national mountain club, based in Canmore, Alberta, the ACC has been a focal point for Canadian mountaineers since 1906. The Alpine Club of Canada operates the largest network of back-country accommodation in North America. Its network of 25 alpine club huts are scattered across Canada, predominantly throughout the Canadian Rockies.

While the officious bystander test is not the overriding formulation in English law today, it provides a useful guide. The suggested approach is to imagine a nosey, officious bystander walking past two contracting parties and asking them whether they would want to put some express term into the agreement. If the parties would instantly retort that such a term is \\"of course\\" already mutually part of the agreement then it is apt for implication. Overview In Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw[1939] 2 KB 206 MacKinnon LJ wrote, The test is outdated to the extent that it suggested implication was a process dependent on what contracting parties would have subjectively intended. The main problem is that people would often disagree, or one side's bargaining power would be such that they could ignore the intentions of the other party. The rule now is that terms are implied to reflect the parties' reasonable expectations as a broader part of the process of objective, contextual construction.

The hut, which is named after Friedrich Simony the first person to ascend Hoher Dachstein, is high above Hallstatt in Upper Austria in the northern part of the Dachstein Mountains. It is open year-round and, in winter, offers numerous options for ski tours and snowshoe walking.https://www.hallstatt.net/about-hallstatt/active-summer- holiday/wanderzeit-en-US/mountain-huts-and-alpine/simonyhut/ The Simony Hut is an important base for climbers because they are able to set out from here on long tours over the Dachsteins. There is also a mountaineering school where training courses are run for glacier or ice climbing. The Dachstein Chapel is nearby.  History  Photograph of the first hut (Friedrich Simony 1877). In 1843 a stone rest and emergency shelter, known as \\"Hotel Simony\\", was opened just below the site of the present hut. In 1876, Friedrich Simony selected the present location himself for construction of the first free-standing wooden building. The opening ceremony was held on 18 August 1877. Over a decade later, the hut had become a popular destination for climbers. The structure was enlarged between 1891 and 1893 to compensate for the increasing numbers of visitors. Further works were carried out from 1922 to 1933, and the hut underwent a general restoration in 1953. No further alterations were made to the original structure after the last major renovations between 1961 and 1963 when a power supply was also added. In 1977, the Simony Hut a celebrated its centenary as a climbing and alpine training centre. In 1989 a biological treatment plant was opened to treat human waste (upgraded in 1998).

Biography Arundell was born at Launceston, Cornwall, in July 1780, being the only son of Thomas Jago, a solicitor in that town, who had married Catherine, a daughter of Mr. Bolt, a surgeon at Launceston. Francis was educated at Liskeard Grammar School and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1809, and after having been ordained in the Church of England he took a curacy at Antony in his native county. From youth to old age Arundell was imbued with a love of antiquarian study, and after his institution in 1805 to the rectory of Landulph on the banks of the Tamar, he threw himself with avidity into the history of Cornwall. When Nicholas Condy, an artist at Plymouth, published a series of views of Cotehele, the ancient seat of Lord Mount Edgcumbe, Arundell supplied the description of the house which accompanied them. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1811, but removed from the fellowship in 1845, for being 28 years behind in his subscription. In the church of Landulph is a brass to the memory of Theodoro Palaeologus, descended from the last of the Byzantine emperors, who died on 21 January 1637, and an account of this inscription, and of the person whom it commemorated, was printed by Jago in the volume of the Arch√¶ologia for 1817, and reprinted in Davies Gilbert's Cornwall (iii, 365). This paper was afterwards amplified into Some Notice of the Church of Landulph, which was published in 1840, and a reprint of which, with additions by Joseph Polsue of Bodmin, was announced some years ago (i.e. before 1885). =Oriental journeys= One of Arundell's ancestors married a co-heiress of John Arundell of Trevarnoe, and Jago assumed that name in addition to his own on 25 February 1815. Next year (17 October) he married Anna Maria, second daughter of Isaac Morier, consul-general at Constantinople, and sister of James Morier, the author of Hajji Baba. After this marriage, Arundell turned his thoughts towards the East and became in 1822 the chaplain to the British factory at Smyrna, where he remained for fourteen years. With characteristic energy he began, very soon after settling at Smyrna, to arrange a tour of exploration in Asia Minor. The months from March to September 1826 were spent in a pilgrimage to the seven churches of Asia and an excursion into Pisidia, a narrative of which was issued in 1828. This book was very favourably received. Encouraged by his published success, Arundell ventured in 1833 upon another tour of 1,000 miles through districts the greater part of which had hitherto not been described by any European traveller, when he made an especial study of the ruins of Antioch in Pisidia. Two volumes describing these discoveries were published in 1834. Although he made a third tour in 1835 and 1836 through Palestine, no account of his travels was published. Whilst residing at Smyrna, Arundell made large collections of antiquities, coins, and manuscripts; on his return to England, the coins were sold to the British Museum. He gave great assistance to the brothers Lysons in their history of Cornwall, and at one time contemplated the publication of a history of that county on his own account. It has even been said that some plates were engraved for it. The materials which he collected for histories of Smyrna and of his native town of Launceston were never used, and are probably lost. He died at Landulph on 5 December 1846 and was buried in its church, not far from the tomb of Pal√¶ologus. His widow died in Osnaburgh Street, London, on 2 June 1869, aged 80.

The bridge was put in service in 1915, destroyed in the Second World War and never rebuilt. Since 2002 the remains of the Hindenburg bridge has been the easternmost point of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Upper Middle Rhine Valley.  Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìR√ºdesheim train ferry The bridge was preceded by the Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìR√ºdesheim train ferry, opened in November 1861, making the first connection between the Nassau Rhine Railway of the Nassau State Railway () and the Nahe Valley Railway of the Rhine-Nahe Railway Company (Rhein-Nahe- Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). This created a freight connection between the Rhine- Main and Saar areas and opened a new market for Saar coal. The freight ferry carried wagons until 1900. The passenger ferry was operated by Prussian State Railways until July 1907. After that passengers were able to use the tram to Bingen and the Bingen‚ÄìR√ºdesheim ferry. Planning and building  In 1900 the Prussian Minister of Public Works in the Prussian House of Representatives spoke in favour of the construction of a bridge over the Rhine at Bingen.Scharf (2003), p. 154 Studies by the Prussian State Railways initially favoured a location at Bingerbr√ºck because the current around the Binger Loch (‚ÄúBingen hole‚Äù, a narrow passage created through a reef in the Rhine in the 17th century and subsequently widened) made a bridge unfeasible in Bingen. Therefore, a site for the bridge was selected upstream of the Rhine island of R√ºdesheim Aue at Rhine km mark 525.26, where the river is about 900 metres wide. Debates about whether to construct a railway bridge, a road bridge or a combined bridge continued for over a decade in the Reichstag until funds for the construction of a railway bridge were approved in March 1913. In this case, military concerns were decisive. The new Rhine bridge was a strategic railway connecting the Right Rhine Railway to the Nahe Valley Railway and the Glan Valley Railway, thus creating another German military railway to the French border. The German Empire provided over 75% of the cost of the bridge and access lines, the rest was funded by the participating states of Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The connecting curve was from the bridge towards Geisenheim and on to Wiesbaden was not eligible for imperial funding, because military transport would apparently follow the Rhine from Oberlahnstein, using the Lahn Valley Railway.Scharf (2003), p. 157 Two similar railway bridges were also built across the Rhine mostly for military reasons: the Crown Prince William Bridge at Urmitz and the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen. The Hindenburg Bridge The construction of the Hindenburg Bridge began in June 1913 and it was opened on 16 August 1915. At the start of construction many foreign laborers, mostly Italians, were employed on the work. After a short interruption of construction at the beginning of the First World War work continued with the use of Russian prisoners of war.Scharf (2003), p. 156 The bridge had a total length of 1,175 metres and consisted of two sets of arches each side of the main 741 m long steel bridge. The steel section consisted of two arches and five spans of parallel trusses, with the tracks mounted on the lower trusses. The steel arches were each 169.4 m long and were unusually high. One of the truss spans was 94.2 m long and the other four were 77.0 m long. The double track bridge had a total width of 12 m of which 7 m was used for rail tracks. On both sides there was a footpath. The bridge together with connecting lines included a total of 11 kilometres of double track main lines. In the north, the bridge connected to two connecting curves to the Right Rhine Railway. On the south (left side) of the Rhine, the line continued south from B√ºdesheim to Sarmsheim on the Bingerbr√ºck‚ÄìBad Kreuznach line. Another curve connected with the Mainz‚ÄìBad Kreuznach line in Ockenheim station. In 1944, during the Second World War, another connection curve was built from Ockenheim station to a single-track branch line to the Left Rhine line towards Bingen. This curve was intended to make the line usable even if the bridge was destroyed. Operations  In the First World War the bridge was used almost exclusively for the supply of German troops on the Western Front. After the war, the left bank of the Rhine and a bridgehead at Wiesbaden was occupied by French troops. The occupation forces seized the bridge and converted it to allow carts and cars to use it. In addition, the bridge was used by military trains and from the end of 1919 by civilian freight trains at night and on a small scale. From October 1920 the bridge was available for use by German civilians, on payment of a high bridge toll (four marks after the hyperinflation culminating in 1923), which led to years of protests from the local business community. After the withdrawal of the occupation troops, Deutsche Reichsbahn (German State Railways) took over passenger rail services over the bridge again in July 1930.Scharf (2003), p. 158 In the summer 1938 timetable eleven weekday passenger services and 15 services on Sundays operated, mainly on the Wiesbaden‚ÄìBad M√ºnster am Stein route. During the Second World War, the bridge was used to overcome disruption on the two Rhine lines. Destruction  Ruins of the Hindenburg Bridge From August 1942 the bridge was the target of several air raids. On 13 January 1945, the spans of the bridge were destroyed. The final destruction of the Hindenburg Bridge was carried out on 15 March 1945 by pioneers of the Wehrmacht in order to impede the advance of the United States armed forces. In the summer of 1945, the wreckage of the bridge was cleared from the main navigation channel of the Rhine and in 1948 the bridge‚Äôs superstructure on the river banks was demolished. Reconstruction of the bridge was discussed until the 1950s. The priority of Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Federal Railways) was to rebuild the Emperor Bridge in Mainz and from 1954 it had no interest in another bridge over the Rhine.Scharf (2003), p. 158f In 1970 the abutments were demolished to improve road safety. From time to time the possibility of rebuilding the bridge is discussed.

The initial purpose was to raise funds for the local community hospital. More recently, other community needs have benefited.  Founding  In 1945, a group of citizens headed by Harry A. Corey, A.E. McLean and Harry T. Swan recognized the need for a community hospital. Mr. & Mrs. David Taylor, and Mrs. Walthall, Mrs. Taylor's sister, donated their summer home in the village for this purpose. This was the beginning of Harvey Community Hospital. The community group also realized the need for ongoing financial support of the hospital, and an annual event to raise money was considered. Someone suggested a Horse Pull (it had worked in Fredericton Junction). In October 1945, the event, ‚ÄòHarvey Hospital Day' was held, and in spite of inclement weather, was a success. This was the origin of Harvey Community Days. The following year it was moved ahead to the third Wednesday in August. Since 1945, Harvey Community Days has only been cancelled once, due to an edict prohibiting public gatherings during the polio epidemic.  Development  Entering into the 1950s, Harvey Hospital Day committees devised various ways to earn money including lobster feeds, bingo games, boxing matches, and airplane rides, as well as the famous ‚ÄòHorse Pull'. Progress and development continued in the late 1950s and 1960s. In 1958 the Harvey Fairground Grandstand was built; in 1966 toilet facilities were added. The timing of the event was changed in 1979, as it remains to this day, with the Saturday of the event being the second Saturday of August. The event's name was also changed that year to ‚ÄòHarvey Community Days.' Originally the festivities were held on the ‚ÄòFair Grounds' near the Taylor Hall, and this continued until 1988, when the Grandstand burned. In 1989 the move was made up the hill to the Recreation Centre to allow more of the events to be held inside. This continues to be the modern ‚ÄòFair Grounds.'  Change of beneficiaries  Until 1967 all proceeds from Hospital Day, or the Harvey Fair, as it had become known, were used to finance and operate the hospital. However, when the province assumed responsibility for the hospital this annual event was no longer necessary. A public meeting was held and because of the past success it was decided to continue the Harvey Fair, with the proceeds to go toward community needs, community organizations, upgrading of cemeteries, etc. In 1974, the community received an ambulance from the government. Since it was the responsibility of the community to operate and maintain the vehicle, it received priority in distributing the proceeds from Benefit Day. Harvey was able to offer its residents ambulance service to any hospital in New Brunswick for a small fee of $5. In 1979, the organizational body changed from the Board of Directors of Harvey Hospital to a board of directors drawn from community organizations and the community at large. The name was again changed to Harvey Community Days Inc.  Recent years  In 1985, a new ambulance was needed and with a government grant of $13,000 and approximately $22,000 from Benefit Day funds a new one was purchased. Again in 1995 Benefit Day funds and a government grant provided another ambulance. In the 2000s, focus turned away from the need to support the ambulance, as Ambulance New Brunswick was formed, taking away the need of individual communities to financially support their local ambulances. The elimination of fees for ambulance transportation by the provincial government also removed the need for Harvey Community Days to provide rebates to community members.

H. L√ºhring shipyard in Brake, Germany, originally as a topsail schooner named Friedrich. History Friedrich was initially used as a schooner for the South American hide trade. In 1923 she was registered in Sweden, under the name Merry, and was used for transport in the Baltic and North seas and for fishing herring off the coast of Iceland during summer. In 1969, then stripped of her masts and sailing as a motor vessel, she was severely damaged in a fire that all but ended her days on the sea. In 1973 a group of sailing enthusiasts, including Anthony \\"Tiger\\" Timbs, who later became her Master, began rebuilding her at Faversham, England. In this restoration she was re- rigged as a brigantine by Master Rigger Wally Buchanan. After the restoration was completed she was given the name Eye of the Wind, inspired by Sir Peter Scott's book published in 1961. In October 1976 she set sail for Australia, the first time since the restoration, three years and eight months after her purchase by the new owners. In 1978, she set sail from Plymouth as the flagship of Operation Drake, a 2-year sailing expedition, which brought her back to London in December 1980. While under the care of Tiger Timbs the ship was commissioned for several film roles. During the filming of Tai-Pan, the film producers fitted her with a set of tan sails in order to be able to play two different ships. The tan sails were retained after filming.Crews records of sailing the ship In 2001, she was taken over by a new owner and registered in Gilleleje, Denmark. Her interior underwent substantial renovations. Also, the new owners decided to call her rig a brig. This was only a change of naming, the rig remained the same since the filming of Tai Pan. Again in 2009 she found a new owner with the Forum Media Group, Germany. Published Books *Eye of the Wind, by E. A.

It is a Ramsar listed wetland site important for migrating, breeding and moulting birds. About 25,000 pairs of wetland birds make their nests there and seasonal conglomerations of birds are up to 100,000 individuals. The area of the lagoon is 215 km2, and the depth up to 3.3 m. Until 1978 the lagoon was separated into two parts: northern brackishwater area, including the rivers Cog√¢lnic and Sarata, and a southern marine area. The lagoon was separated from the sea by a 0.5 km wide sandbar.  Dam and reduced salinity  In 1978 a concrete dam was built on the sandbar and the lagoon was connected to the Danube River by a canal, through which fresh flood waters come. This has adversely changed the salinity in the lake, and this plus disturbances from recreation and commercial fishing activities have influenced the habitat for wildfowl. The aim of this Soviet dam project was to convert the lagoon to a fresh water lake to use for irrigation. However, this failed and the use of water from Sasyk resulted in the salinization of about 30,000 hectares of land, with associated detrimental impact on crops, and mineralization of ground water and wells. The project ended in ecological, social and economic disaster. A 2007 report stated that the lagoon had become too dangerous for swimming because of pollution, including pesticides and heavy metals. The water is described as greenish with an unpleasant smell. Many now favour breaking the dam and reconnecting the lagoon with the sea.

A shrine of the same name has been built and is dedicated to her. The icon is highly venerated in Lithuania and is often called \\"Lithuania's greatest treasure\\". Pope Pius VI granted a Canonical coronation to the venerated image on 8 September 1786. The town of ≈†iluva is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Lithuania with its ancient tradition of the Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, popularly called \\"≈†ilinƒós\\", also celebrated on September 8. Background Marian devotion at ≈†iluva goes back almost to the beginning of Christianity in Lithuania. Grand Duke Jogaila was baptized Catholic in 1387 when he married the queen of neighboring Poland. Later he and his successors worked to spread the Christian faith in their territory, which until then was pagan. They established the ecclesiastical hierarchy, built churches and even personally taught catechism to their subjects. History The establishment of a church in ≈†iluva was the initiative of a nobleman named Petras Gedgaudas who worked in the service of Vytautas the Great. Gedgaudas in 1457 allocated land and other resources for a temple in honor of our Lady. Gedgaudas built a church dedicated to the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Apostles SS. Peter and Bartholomew. Huge crowds of the faithful, even from neighboring Protestant Prussia, would flock to this site to celebrate the indulgenced Feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The icon is painted in the Our Lady of the Way style, and is similar to the famous Madonna Salus Populi Romani. According to legend, the miraculous icon was brought to Siluva from Rome in 1457 as a gift to Lithuanian nobleman Petras Gedgaudas.The other faces of Mary: stories, devotions, and pictures of the Holy Virgin around the world by Ann Ball 2004 page 153 The new church gained fame as a Marian shrine. By 1532 the population in the vicinity of ≈†iluva became predominantly Calvinist. In the following decades, many Catholic churches were confiscated and closed. Nevertheless, as long as the old church was open, the people continued to attend the annual Feast until finally the church was closed and eventually burned to the ground.Albino, Joseph. \\"Honor Mary, Lithuanian Style\\", National Catholic Register, September 8, 2014 In the 16th century, a Lutheran pastor complained about members of his flock traveling to ≈†iluva to attend the indulgenced Catholic feast of the Nativity of Mary. Around the year 1569 the only remaining parish priest, Father John Holubka, hid all the surviving church valuables and documents in an ironclad box which he buried on the grounds of the devastated church. The Catholics subsequently attempted legal proceedings against the Calvinists, seeking to regain the confiscated church property. The case was complicated by the fact that the Catholic ownership documents had become lost. Basilic of the Nativity of Mary, Siluva Apparition This issue was resolved in the summer of 1608 when a few children tending their sheep in a field some distance away from ≈†iluva reported that they saw a beautiful woman holding a baby, appeared on the very spot where the church had stood. She was weeping bitterly. The children returned the next day accompanied by many from the whole village and a Calvinist minister, and they saw her, as well. When word spread, an old blind man who had assisted the priest in burying the treasures of the original church recalled the location. After the apparition, the institutional documents of the Catholic church were found, and in 1622 the case concerning the restitution of Catholic ownership was won. A small wooden church, the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was built on the site of the original church, but proved too small for the many pilgrims who visited. A much larger church was built in 1641. Pope Pius VI confirmed the authenticity of the apparition of Our Lady of ≈†iluva by a papal decree promulgated on August 17, 1775.\\"Envoy Named for Centenary of Lithuania Apparitions\\", Zenit, August 22, 2008 The present-day Basilica of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was consecrated in 1786. The building is one of the finest examples of late Baroque architecture in Lithuania. The interior, designed by Lithuanian artist, Thomas Podgaiskis, has been preserved without significant changes for over two centuries. Prior to the World War II, processions used to depart from every Lithuanian town, making pilgrimage to ≈†iluva. The 13th day of each month is known as ‚ÄúMary‚Äôs Day‚Äù Veneration On August 17, 1775, Pope Pius VI, promulgated with a Papal Decree the authenticity of Our Lady of ≈†iluva. A Chapel of the Apparition was built in the Egyptian-Revival and Gothic styles features the tallest steeple in Lithuania. It was built over the rock where the Blessed Mother stood. The rock itself, which pilgrim make a point to kiss, is under the altar of the chapel. For its devotion to Mary, Pope Pius XI called Lithuania Terra Mariana (Land of Mary). Pope Pius VI approved devotions to Our Lady of ≈†iluva and granted indulgences for them. Pope John Paul II prayed at the shrine in the humble Lithuanian village of ≈†iluva in 1993, two years after the Baltic nation regained independence. Benedict XVI in 2006 blessed new crowns of gold for a miraculous image of Mary and Jesus at ≈†iluva. In 2008 he sent a papal legate to take part in festivities at ≈†iluva to mark the fourth centenary of the Marian apparition. In the United States, the chapel of Our Lady of Siluva is located within the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The Lithuanian emigre and refugee community in the United States, under the leadership of Bishop Vincent Brizgys, organized in 1963 for establishment of this Siluva Chapel, which was dedicated in 1966. It displays the artistry of Lithuanian artists in exile at that time, due to Soviet occupation and repression of Lithuania during and following World War II. Vytautus Kasuba based his statue of Our Lady of Siluva with Christ Child on written accounts of witnesses from 1608. Mosaics by Vytautas Jonynas depict the religious and cultural history of Lithuania in two large mosaic panels in the side walls of the chapel, one showing the traditional image of the \\"R≈´pintojƒólis\\" or Christ the Worrier, and the second depicting information about the Lithuanian prince and saint, Casimir. Mosaics and stained glass by Albinas Elskus decorate the golden ceiling with four images of the Madonna from Lithuanian churches, the altar frontispiece showing traditional Lithuanian wayside crosses and the altar back decoration with blue and golden aura about the statue of Our Lady of Siluva. On October 16, 2016, the American-Lithuanian community celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the dedication of the Chapel.An exhibit regarding the history of the chapel and its representation of Lithuanian cultural and religious traditions was hosted in the Basilica's Memorial Hall from July 1 through October 17.Landwehr, J≈´ratƒó Maci≈´nas. \\"The Chapel of Our Lady of ≈†iluva in Washington, D.C.\\", Lithuanian Heritage, May/June 2016 In addition to the chapel in Washington D.C., there are several other sites within the United States dedicated to Our Lady of Siluva. These include shrines in Chicago, Illinois; and in Putnam, Connecticut; and in East St. Louis, Missouri. *There is a statue of Our Lady of Siluva outside the small mission church in Rincon, New Mexico.≈Ωalpys, Vilius. \\"A trip turned pilgrimage. Our Lady of ≈†iluva de Rincon, New Mexico\\", Draugas News, May 4, 2017 *There is a shrine to Our Lady of Siluva in the parish church of SS Peter and Paul in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The shrine, dedicated June 29, 1958, is richly ornamented with Lithuanian artwork and woodcarvings, and holds a painting depicting the apparition and a relic of the original stone on which Our Lady stood. Because, inspired by the apparition, the community returned to the devout practice of their religion, Our Lady of ≈†iluva is invoked as the patroness of those who have lapsed from the faith, and of those who pray for them. Legacy The Knights of Lithuania have sponsored the establishment of the \\"Our Lady of Siluva Fund, Inc.\\" during its 2003 National Convention in Brockton, MA, as it celebrated its 90th anniversary. The purpose of the fund is to help promulgate knowledge of and devotion to Our Lady through her appearance at Siluva, Lithuania, in 1608.

In 1917 Goriupp obtained a diploma to teach Hungarian and German, having attended the universities of Vienna and Leipzig on a partial scholarship. Afterwards she continued her studies at the University of Vienna. In 1917-18 she taught German language at her alma mater. In 1918 she began as a trainee at the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library (Orsz√°gos Sz√©ch√©nyi K√∂nyvt√°r) in Budapest and in 1922 became an assistant library warden. With the newspaper library in poor condition after World War I, she compiled newspaper cataloguing rules in 1923 and directed the furnishing of a newly built warehouse in 1926. In 1928-29 she travelled to Austria for a year of further study abroad, and again in 1935 to Germany. Having studied Germany's new national library cataloging system introduced in Berlin, G√∂ttingen, Frankfurt and Darmstadt, she established a new cataloguing system at the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library in 1936. The reform introduced the Universal Decimal Classification and solved the problem of creating multiple catalogues indexed by author, title, subject, etc. In 1944 she became the national library's collections manager, her concern focused primarily on the safety of the collection during wartime. In 1945 and 1946 she was instrumental in the postwar restoration and reorganization.

It is situated at Donnybrook, Dublin 4. The building houses the main production studios for RT√â Television, the control rooms for all RT√â's TV channels, and RT√â's main newsroom. History When plans for an Irish national television station were developed in the late 1950s attention quickly turned to a suitable location for the new television studios and adjoining offices. By September 1959 a 25-acre area of land on the Stillorgan road in Donnybrook became the favoured site for the new television production centre. On 3 October 1960 the new Radio √âireann Authority signed a ¬£500,000 contract for the construction of the television centre and offices at the proposed location. A few hours after this the contractors began to move in. The contract was awarded to Messrs. E. Stone & Sons Ltd. from Thorncastle street in Dublin, one of four firms invited to tender.\\"Work starts on ¬£500,000 TV studios\\", The Irish Times, 4 October 1960 The building when completed in 1962 contained the first purpose-built television studios in Ireland, as existing studios in Belfast had been set up in converted buildings. At the beginning of \\"The Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland a bomb damaged the front of the building early on the morning of 5 August 1969.Bomb Damages RT√â TV Studios.

The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) claimed responsibility, this being the first bomb that they had ever planted in the Republic of Ireland.\\"Dublin blast\\". The Lewiston Daily Sun, 29 December 1969 The bombing took place during the protest campaign by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association but before the 1969 riots. The building =Design= The Television Centre, designed by the Scott-Tallon-Walker firm of architects in Dublin, is 30 feet high with the tops of the main studios rising a further 15 feet above the roof line. In all there are eight television studios in the building, four main production studios; 1,2,4,and 5, a news studio; 3, and three presentation studios; 6,7, and 8, as well as a small studio for radio news bulletins. =Studios= There were only three studios in the original building completed in 1962, however, since then a number of new studios and sound stages have been added to the existing complex. From the early 1970s all the studios were gradually converted to colour operation starting with Studio 3, the news studio, and finishing with Studio 1 in 1976. Since January 2019 all of the studios have been upgraded to High Definition standard. In the late 1970s RT√â's schedule was increasing and expanding, especially with the launch of Ireland's second channel RT√â 2 in November 1978. There was also a growing need for a new larger television studio, as Studio 1 was seen as being too small for many productions. Studios 4 and 5 were constructed towards the end of the 1970s. Studio 4 measures , making it the largest purpose-built television studio in Ireland. From the early 1980s onwards it would be home to the majority of RT√â's large audience based shows. In 1995 Studio 4 was redeveloped to better cater for audiences, and a new permanent seating rostra was built into it that can accommodate audiences of up to 250. Today Studio 4 is one of the busiest studios in the Television Centre, accommodating The Late Late Show, The Ray D'Arcy Show and Prime Time all in one week. As well as the studios the building also houses the control rooms for the various channels, MCR (Master Control Room), technical areas for video playout, edit suites, graphics area, scene dock, dressing rooms, green rooms, makeup area, wardrobe, a radio news studio, RT√â's main newsroom and the RTE Canteen. In an adjoining building there are also two sound stages which are used for dramas, soaps etc. such as RT√â's flagship soap Fair City, and the award winning drama Love/Hate. The sound stages are named A and B and both measure . Studio 1 Completed in 1962, Studio 1 was originally the largest studio in the television centre and was originally designed for variety shows, dramas and musicals. The studio can comfortably accommodate an audience of 120. It is currently home to many of RT√â's game shows, including Winning Streak and Know The Score. Former programmes recorded or transmitted included: Studio 2 Studio 2, the second of the original studios, was designed for interviews, panel games and current affairs programmes. Programmes recorded or transmitted included: Studio 3 The original studio was extended and equipped with unmanned robotic cameras in 2009. During December 2018 and January 2019 the studio was refurbished and upgraded to High Definition working to coincide with a relaunch of RTE News presentation on Monday 28 January 2019. The refurbishment of the studio and news presentation was part of a ‚Ç¨1.7 million revamp. Studio 4 The largest studio in the television centre, it can accommodate audiences of up to 250. This studio is home to programmes such as The Late Late Show, The Ray D'Arcy Show, The Tommy Tiernan Show, The Imelda May Show, Claire Byrne Live and Prime Time. Studio 4 was completed in 1982 but did not enter full operation until 1986 when the popular weekday afternoon talk/entertainment show \\"Live at 3\\" was produced from the studio. Studio 4 was completely overhauled and refurbished in the summer of 1995 which saw it gain a permanent audience rostra installed which could accommodate audiences of up to 250 if required. The long running Late Late Show and other key audience based entertainment shows moved into Studio 4 from Autumn 1995. Studio 5 Built in the late 1970s, Studio 5 was the first studio in the television centre to be upgraded to High Definition. As home to RT√â Sport, programmes broadcast from the studio include The Sunday Game, Soccer Republic, Against the Head, as well as RT√â's coverage of the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League and Six Nations Championship. Studio 5 was used as the main election studio for RTE's 2020 general election coverage in February 2020, supported by Studio 3 and the RTE Newsroom.

One of his early missions was to interview Thomas Darcy, who was implicated in the pro-Catholic rebellion called the Pilgrimage of Grace. He met Darcy at Templehurst, near Selby on 14 November 1536 accompanied by Henry Ray, Berwick Pursuivant. Though this meeting was conciliatory, Darcy was subsequently executed.

He then sees Anya whom he had been looking for throughout the previous novel in the series. As they leave the temple together, he spies a statue of Set initially taking it to be a man wearing a totem mask. They enter a garden and as Orion tries to take a fruit, Anya stops him warning him of Set who owns the garden. She then tells him of their mission which is to assess the situation and then come back for more equipment. As they walk on they encounter a group of slaves been guarded by a dinosaur. Orion with the help of Anya, then saves the baby from been killed and eaten by the dinosaur. The slaves been cowed warn of the retribution from their masters. Orion then decides to take them along till they get to the forest. Upon arrival in the forest, Anya tries to contact the rest of the Creators only to discover that her access has been blocked by Set thus trapping them in that era without any help. They however, try to settle down in the area and look for game to kill so as to survive. Anya, then encourages Orion to try to initiate contact maybe he would be successful. This serves as a beacon for Set now locates them and promises to send them punishment for killing his creature. They then move deep inside the forest where, they hide and encounter another group of humans, who already live there, led by Kraal. Orion then suggests the merging of the two groups under Kraal's leadership which he reluctantly agrees to. However, that same night, Set sends huge gigantic snakes which attack them and kill quite a number of them. This almost weakens Kraal's resolve to unite his people to stand against Set. Orion however, convinces him and together with Anya, they try to unite the tribes to stand against Set. Their work is unfortunately undone by Reeva, one of the slaves whose baby Orion saved from the dinosaur and now Kraal's wife, sells Anya and Orion out to Set. They are both captured and taken to Set's fortress. Set tries to torture them in order to find out about a particular time nexus. They succeed in escaping but are unable to fight their way out. They then jump into Set's time warp device and try to use it to escape. They find out that the time warp is too strong to be over ridden and find themselves in the Cretaceous. They try to discover what Set's plan is for that era. They are eventually captured and Set deals with Anya who with her fellow Creators abandon both the earth and Orion to Set's devilish plans in order to save their skin. However, Set plans to send Orion to a time before the Creators became aware of him to murder, them all. He almost succeeds but Orion manages to break free of his control and he allows himself to be used by the creators to destroy Sheol the sun of Set's home planet Shaydan. This sets of a cataclysm wherein the debris of Shaydan then pelts the earth with meteors which wipe out the dinosaurs leaving only mammals. However, Set survives and is hiding on earth in the Neolithic. Orion also awakes back in the Neolithic and is intent upon revenge. He goes back into the Dark Ages and brings along the army of Subotai, general of Ogotai's Mongolian army. He then goes to Set's fortress himself to confront him.

The following is a small list of animals currently held in the parks collection. * Koalas * Peacocks * Little penguins * Cockatoos * Dingos * Emus * Kangaroos * Wombats * Echidnas *Native Birds Events The park has a Live Sheep Shearing exhibition run at various times of the day called \\"The Stockman's Camp\\" it gives patrons the experience of a stock camp on an outback station. It also shows sheep shearing and recounts Australian bush stories. The park also abides by the state Minimum Koala Handling Time, thus permitting visitors to safely handle the animals. Conservation The Koala Park Sanctuary opened a Koala Research Hospital in 1930. The hospital cares for sick and injured native animals and releases them back into the wild. It is open to the public and aids in education about native animals and the problems faced by the koalas living close to human areas. Controversy In December 2010 Department of Primary Industries inspectors reported finding ageing and dirty animal exhibits, drainage problems and out-of-date records. The inspectors issued a series of notices to Koala Park Sanctuary to fix the issues. A newspaper editor attended the park and claimed a number of issues had not been resolved and believed that animals were suffering, however an RSPCA inspector who visited the park said he did not believe any of the animals were suffering or had been neglected or were malnourished. On 2 February 2016, the RSPCA fined the sanctuary $75,000 and banned them from acquiring new koalas for six months due to one koala being dehydrated with an emaciated body, and all five showing signs of chlamydia.

Because of the theming of the park, Europe in the Air simulated flight over Europe's most notable icons. The park stated the picture is \\"eight times clearer than HD.\\" Other features, such as fans, were used for a more realistic journey. Europe in the Air replaced the Corkscrew Hill ride for the 2010 season. It was previously sponsored by Aer Lingus. History In 2009, it was announced that the Corkscrew Hill ride would retire to make way for Europe in the Air. The ride was originally manufactured by the now-defunct Reflectone company. Europe in the Air closed on June 30, 2013, for the rest of the 2013 season. It was later reopened for the 2014 season. On March 18, 2017, Busch Gardens announced that Europe in the Air would be replaced by a VR attraction, and the ride did not reopen for the season- making 2016 Europe in the Air's final season.

Next, guests enter a room with a pre- show, showing an \\"advertisement\\" and summary of Europe in the Air, a fictional airline. After that, another preshow in the next room requires riders to stand in front of the row of your choice. This time the pre-show is more about safety than humor. After this, guests enter the ride. =Pre-shows= * The first of the two pre-shows show a flight attendant telling about the features of the flight, like Big Ben or the Eiffel Tower, and Coronado Romero. * The second pre-show is aimed at telling guests how to fasten their seatbelts, to remain seated, and if you should or shouldn't ride. =Ride= The ride vehicle is a large box-like seating area, occupied by rows of seats.

History Beurs-WTC's history dates back to 1598, the year the first Rotterdam Beurs was founded. This fair proved extremely successful. Later lack of space led to the creation of larger exhibition buildings of which the building at the Westnieuwland was the longest existing (1736‚Äì1940). This building was designed by Adriaen van der Werff. The low-rise of the current fair complex was designed by architect J. F. Staal with interiors by Margaret Staal-Kropholler and was built between 1936 and 1940. In the Rotterdam Blitz on 14 May 1940 the exhibition centre took a number of hits, but the damage could be repaired quickly. In 1941, the Stock Exchange reopened on Coolsingel. This building with many features included not only many trade fairs but also shops, conference rooms, a bar and offices. In 1973 an extra floor was added to the low-rise building. Architect of this expansion is Arthur Staal, the son of J. F. Staal. There is also a catering establishment which carries the name \\"Staal\\". There are many business people their daily lunch in the restaurant on the second floor, or in summer on the terrace below and to the Coolsingel Beursplein. On the third floor, still room language, the former meeting room of the Chamber of Commerce. This is now used for weddings, conferences, parties, and so forth. In 1984 the construction of a new office tower in the middle of the existing low-rise began. The green elliptical tower, designed by architect Rob van Erk, was completed in 1987. Queen Beatrix opened and named the entire construction the Beurs-World Trade Center. Currently the Beurs-WTC is home to a trade show, the Insurance Exchange. The Beurs-World Trade Center is owned and operated by Beurs Rotterdam NV which also owns the building. The Beurs-WTC is easily accessible by public transport, metro station Beurs the front door.

It centers on the belief that there have been successive incarnations of the Deity throughout history, and Ali Ilahees reserve particular reverence for Ali, the son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who is considered one such incarnation. Various rites have been attributed as Ali Ilahian, similarly to the Yezidis, Ansaris, and all sects whose doctrine is unknown to the surrounding Muslim and Christian population. Observers have described it as an agglomeration of the customs and rites of several earlier religions, including Zoroastrianism, historically because travelogues were \\"evident that there is no definite code which can be described as Ali Illahism\\".; Sometimes Ali- Illahism is used as a general term for the several denominations that venerate or deify Ali, like the Kaysanites, the Alawis or the Ahl-e Haqq/Yarsanis, others to mean the Ahl-e Haqq. In the Dabestan-e Mazaheb The Dabestan-e Mazaheb (a Persian book of the 17th century about the South Asian religions) presents the Ali Illahians as a sect that respected Muhammad and Ali and discarded the Quran as it was compiled under Umar.

It came as a shock when Thomas announced his decision to attend the University of Oregon over USC, which was 10 minutes from where he lived. Coming out of high school, he was the #1 rated defensive back in the 2011 recruiting class but his desire to play offense in college grew over his senior season at Crenshaw High School.http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/348817-deanthony-thomas- could-play-ducks-cornerback On January 29, 2011, Thomas secretly visited Oregon on a recruiting trip and decided to play for the Ducks in Chip Kelly's blur offense. =2011= Thomas had a standout 2011 season as a true freshman for Oregon. Splitting time between running back and wide receiver, as well as returning kickoffs and punts, Thomas amassed 2,235 all-purpose yards and scored 18 total touchdowns, setting a school record for number of touchdowns by a freshman. Thomas was the only player in the 2011 college football year to amass 400 yards each in rushing, receiving, and returns. He was a co-recipient of the 2011 CFPA Kickoff Returner Trophy and a freshman All-American selection. He led all freshmen with 18 touchdowns. On January 2, 2012, Thomas recorded two touchdowns and 314 all-purpose yards in the Rose Bowl where Oregon won 45-38 over #10 Wisconsin.

On August 7, 2014, Thomas returned a punt 80 yards for a touchdown in the Chiefs' first preseason game. After being drafted, Thomas was expected to play a wide receiver and running back hybrid position in the offense, as well as being the punt returner, similar to the way Dexter McCluster had been used in previous seasons before leaving the team in the offseason. In the 2014 NFL season, Thomas rushed 14 times for 113 yards, and one touchdown, as well as catching 23 passes for 156 yards. In addition to that he returned a punt for 81 yards and a touchdown against the Oakland Raiders on December 14. He ended the season with 405 punt return yards off of 34 attempts. He was also the Chiefs main kick returner, he returned 14 kicks for 428 yards. 2015 season In the 2015 offseason, Thomas was permanently switched to wide receiver. His amount of touches dropped off but he was still able to score 1 touchdown on 17 catches for 140 yards, and score 1 rushing touchdown in 9 attempts for 34 yards. On December 31, 2015, Thomas was placed on the non-football illness (NFI) list. Although his season was cut short, he was still able to put up high numbers with low volume. 2016 season Thomas made his return to the field in the 2016 season. He saw much of his role decrease, especially as a return specialist, with the emergence of rookie speedster Tyreek Hill. Thomas still got to return 15 kicks for 338 yards, but didn't return a single punt. Yet, he was still able to obtain 35 yards off of 7 catches, and 29 yards in 4 rushing attempts. With his role decreased, he emerged in a different position as a gunner on punts and kicks. He racked up 2 combined tackles (1 solo) for the season, including a few very hard hits. 2017 season At the beginning of the 2017 season, it looked as if Thomas' main role was kick returner. He was shortly removed from that job when he became more involved in the offense with the injury of their No. 1 receiver Chris Conley. In 16 games, Thomas had 143 yards on 14 receptions for 2 touchdowns. Those touchdowns came in back to back weeks, including a catch and run for 57 yards and a touchdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers on October 15. He also continued to be a gunner on special teams. He was placed on injured reserve on January 2, 2018 with a leg injury. 2018 season On March 14, 2018, Thomas re-signed with the Chiefs. On September 9, 2018, he caught a one-yard touchdown pass in a 38‚Äì28 win over the Los Angeles Chargers. The following week, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Thomas returned a punt 48 yards in the 42‚Äì37 win. He was placed on injured reserve on October 13, 2018 after suffering a fractured leg in practice. 2019 season On August 20, 2019, Thomas re-signed with the Chiefs. He was suspended for the first game of the season for violating the NFL's policy on substance abuse, and placed on reserve/suspended on August 31. He was reinstated from suspension and the Chiefs were given a roster exemption after the regular season opener on September 9. On September 10, he was activated. On October 22, 2019, he was released by the Chiefs./ =Baltimore Ravens= On November 5, 2019, Thomas was signed by the Baltimore Ravens. On March 16, 2020, Thomas re-signed with the Ravens. He chose to opt-out of the 2020 NFL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic on July 27, 2020.

The project's innovative molten salt storage system was to capture solar energy and deliver power to the grid even after the sun goes down.

She also played Timmin in the Doctor Who episode The Caves of Androzani. She appeared in Sorry! and Chance in a Million. Her West End appearances included \\"Fringe Benefits\\" at the Whitehall Theatre and \\"Good\\" at the Aldwych. Barbara married Johannesburg theatre producer/actor Louis Ife. Barbara's parents Edith and Gordon Kinghorn were well-known performing arts figures in Johannesburg. Gordon was chairman of JODS(Johannesburg Operatic and Dramatic Society) whilst Edith was an industrious speech and drama teacher at various schools throughout the city and its suburbs. Edith regularly produced many varied and popular Gilbert and Sullivan operettas mostly at high-schools to a very high standard. Edith was also a skilled Scottish and Highland dancing teacher. Gordon Kinghorn and JODS staged world-class productions including an acclaimed \\"The Man of La Mancha\\" at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre. Barbara's sister Elizabeth had an exceptional and sought-after soprano voice. Barbara's dramatic and dancing skills, she was possessed of a wicked sense of humour and great practical-joker were honed via her love of Highland and Scottish Highland dancing, winning several medals and awards from childhood. The entire Kinghorn family were avid supporters of the Johannesburg Caledonian Society (at its it was the largest Caledonian Society outside of Scotland;regularly frequented by visiting Scottish dancing adjudicators) and were the doyens of the Society. Barbara's book \\"Miss McKirdy's Daughters will now Dance the Highland Fling\\" provides her account of a Scottish dancing career, the Kinghorn family's own performing-arts endeavours and her insights into the competitive rivalries between various Scottish dancing studios in the greater Johannesburg. In 1995 Black Swan published Barbara's autobiography entitled \\"Miss McKirdy's Daughters will now Dance the Highland Fling\\" which received excellent notices and it was also printed by St. Martin's Press New York. Miss McKirdy, affectionately as \\"Aunty\\" to all spent decades of her life patiently thumping out the repetitive music necessary for the Scottish dancing studios at the piano. She was however also a superb pianist/accompanist she provided the live music for evening Caledonian events such as Burns Nicht and Hogmanay, keeping both young and old dancing for hours. On such occasions she often accompanied a fiddler or accordionist shouting out key-changes above the din. Aunty could effortlessly changes keys, effortlessly sustain strict-tempos and was never seen using sheet music. Soon after the book's publication Barbara retired from the theatre and now lives in Spain.

Billy Gibbons upright=1.25 =Guitars= Billy Gibbons' most novel guitar is the white spinning fur guitar made by Dean Zelinsky of Dean Guitars (and matching bass played by ZZ Top bassist Dusty Hill) featured in the 1983 \\"Legs\\" music video. Gibbons described the mechanics of the spin: Gibbons' choice of electric guitars has primarily been Gibson. His first guitar was a sunburst 1962 Gibson Melody Maker. In 1968 Gibbons acquired the instrument most associated with the sound and style of ZZ Top, when he purchased a sunburst 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard guitar from a farmer in Houston, Texas for $250. The guitar was named \\"Pearly Gates\\", a name taken from the dangerous-to-drive, rolling-wreck auto that he sold for the money to buy the guitar. This guitar has become the foundation/benchmark of every ZZ Top album since the group formed in 1969. Along with Gibson, Gibbons is also known for playing various Fender guitars. During his stint in the Moving Sidewalks, Gibbons used a white 1963 Fender Jazzmaster and Fender Esquire. He has also used an extremely rare \\"Gretsch Jupiter Thunderbird\\" given to him by Bo Diddley. The use of this guitar (beginning with the 2003 ZZ Top album Mescalero) inspired a signature production model, the \\"Gretsch Billy-Bo Jupiter Thunderbird.\\" For Mescalero, Gibbons also relied heavily on Ulrich Teuffel's futuristic Birdfish guitar, claiming it was second only to his 1959 Les Paul Sunburst Standard, \\"Pearly Gates\\". According to Gibbons, \\"It really shines on Mescalero because of that dirty, raunchy tone. I defy any other instrument, besides these odd-ball things, to get that crazy.‚ÄúGuitar World, June 2003 Gibbons has worked with Thomas Nilsen of Cream T Pickups to create the BFG Banger Humbucker Pickup. Billy has used these pickups live for the past decade.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=731D191pmkk =Amplifiers= Gibbons' sound is based on a 100-watt Marshall Super Lead made in 1968. According to an interview with music retailer Musician's Friend in 2008, Gibbons stated the importance of the Marshall Super Lead in ZZ Top's sound: > \\"I would say that it was the '59 Gibson Les Paul, better known now as > 'Pearly Gates', plugged into a hundred-watt Marshall. [It] designed a sound > that still resonates today.\\" Along with the Super Leads, he has used a variety of Marshall's products, including the JCM 900 Dual Reverb, Bluesbreaker, JTM45, Major, and Lead 12. Recently, his live touring rack consists of the JMP-1 Preamp, combined with power amps like the Valvestate 120 or the 9200 model. Gibbons has a large collection of vintage Fender amplifiers (his first amp was a Fender Champ), and collects Fender Dual Professionals. Other Fenders he has used include a Fender Bassman and Fender Tweed Deluxe. Gibbons now uses Magnatone amplifiers. At the 2010 Winter NAMM show, Dunlop Manufacturing and Gibbons unveiled a new line of guitar accessories, Rev. Willy's. These include Gibbons inspired picks, strings, and slides. Dusty Hill upright=1.25 Preferring the Fender Telecaster style bass, Dusty Hill also uses many different basses and amplifiers in different combos, and maintains a large collection of vintage as well as custom basses by noted luthier, John Bolin of Bolin Guitars USA. Hill is noted for designing simple, uncomplicated basses with a single pickup with a single volume knob, with the sometime rare addition including a specially powered knob for tone control.

Led by Valentin de los Santos, he functioned as a cult leader. Valentin de los Santos was a Bicolano and established Lapiang Malaya in the 1940s, building up its membership from the peasantry from Southern Luzon. He advocated true justice, true equality and true freedom in the country. His method of attaining his goals include communicating with the Bathala and Filipino heroes like Jose Rizal, linked the attainment of freedom with the Second Coming of Christ, and relied on amulets and prayers. The party contested the 1957 presidential election with de los Santos and Restituto Fresto as their candidates for president and vice president, respectively. Both were defeated by incumbent Carlos P. Garcia, and Diosdado Macapagal, respectively, getting less than 0.50% of the vote. The party also contested the 1957 Senate election, although none of their candidates garnered enough votes to win seats in the Senate; with eight seats up for election and the country using plurality-at-large voting where each voter had eight votes and the eight candidates with the most votes are elected, the party's best candidate finished 41st with 8,915 votes, well behind the eighth-placed candidate which had 1,350,868 votes. On May 21, 1967, the group plotted to overthrow the government of president Ferdinand Marcos. Armed with bolos and wearing amulets, the group composed of about 380 individuals wearing blue uniforms with red and yellow capes, marched to Malaca√±ang Palace. They were stopped by the Philippine Constabulary, armed with M-16s, in Taft Avenue, Pasay. The group charged the ranks of the police and were shot at, leaving at least 33 dead and 47 wounded. The survivors and de los Santos were later arrested for sedition. De los Santos, instead of going to jail, was sent to the National Center for Mental Health since he was thought to be insane; most reports state that he was mauled and killed while in the hospital, while his supporters claim that he died peacefully past 80 years old at Nueva Vizcaya. It was also in Nueva Vizcaya where his supporters lived in seclusion for forty years. The leadership was succeeded by Domingo De Guia, de los Santos' son-in-law, who became famous by having the power to heal and established \\"Vucal ng Pananampalataya\\", their community in the province. When Domingo died in 2005, he was succeeded by his son, Tal De Guia.

Biography =Childhood= Frimpong grew up in Kumasi, Ghana, and moved to the Netherlands at age 8. He met some students who had studied in America and heard about running opportunities there. In order to utilize the time when he was unable to participate in athletic competitions, Akwasi applied to several colleges in America.

He was not selected for the relay team for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics as he was not among the top six runners that year. =Bobsled= After failing to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics, Frimpong switched sports to bobsled, competing as a brakeman for the Netherlands bobsled second-ranked team piloted by Ivo de Bruin, although he was later replaced. =Skeleton, and Olympic qualification via continental representation= After failing to qualify for de Bruin's bobsled team, and with the encouragement of his bobsleigh coach and his wife, he changed sports and national representation in a bid to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics in the sport of skeleton. As Frimpong would not qualify based on standard performance in skeleton, Frimpong elected to represent his birth country of Ghana, which would afford him a near-automatic Olympic berth, as an otherwise unrepresented continent (termed \\"continental representation\\"). Like many athletes, Frimpong was not fully nationally funded. Frimpong was helped by donations of an SUV by a local car dealership and multiple sponsorships, as well as coaching and resources provided by the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation, and the United States. By the end of 2016 he was ranked 95th in the world. In 2018, Frimpong had slipped to 99th at the close of the qualification period. In prior Olympics, this would have placed Frimpong well outside the cutoff of a necessary 60th placement and is the lowest ever ranking for an Olympic skeleton athlete since skeleton returned to the Olympic program in 2002. However, for PyeongChang, new qualification rules did not hold this requirement, and Frimpong was extended an invite via \\"continental representation,\\" originally displacing Alex Hanssen of Norway (who later qualified via re-allocation). No other skeleton athletes qualified via continental representation. Frimpong finished in last place at the PyeongChang Games, of the thirty entrants, a year after finishing in last place at the 2017 IBSF World Championships of the 44 entrants. In February 2020, Akwasi became the first African skeleton athlete to win a skeleton race during the 2020 USA Western Regionals international class in Park City, Utah.

This church is part of the Eastern Oklahoma Presbytery of the United Presbyterian Church in the USA (UPCUSA). History =1880s to 1910= In 1882, two brothers, James M. Hall and Harry C. Hall, established a general store at what is now the intersection of First and Main Streets, near the Frisco railroad tracks in the Indian Territory town of Tulsa. \\"Obituary:James M. Hall,\\" Tulsa World, May 27, 1935 James Hall has been credited with organizing First Presbyterian Church (FPC), the first permanent Protestant church in Tulsa, which began meeting at Presbyterian School House in 1885. The first ministers at this church were itinerant Presbyterian missionaries, whose salaries were paid by their denomination, the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America (PCUSA). Rev. Robert McGill Loughridge, preached the first sermon on August 19, 1883 on the porch of the Hall store.Sherman, Bill. Tulsa World. Church's 1875 origin linked to missionary. June 23, 2007. Retrieved May 12, 2013. The first installed pastor was Reverend William Penn Haworth. He entreated the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Mission to approved funds to build Tulsa's first school house, which also served as Tulsa's first church. In 1888 Rev. Haworth was assaulted for preaching against vices and sustained injuries that required his early retirement4th & Boston, Mullerhaus Legacy (October 20, 2016). In 1901, Reverend Charles William Kerr, a missionary from Pennsylvania, answered a call to become the second minister. He proved to be a very dynamic personality and instigated a rapid growth of the congregation. The discovery of oil at nearby Red Fork in 1901 and another at Glenpool in 1905 had initiated a population boom that would radically transform Tulsa over the next half century. FPC soon outgrew the Hall store and moved to a purpose-built clapboard structure at 4th street and Boston Avenue, completed in 1899. James Hall had also founded the Union Sunday School, an interdenominational organization, with two other people. Later, he became superintendent of the FPC Sunday school, a position he held for twenty years. =1910 to 1926= In 1910, the church moved to a new three-story limestone building at the southeast corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue. An impressive building in its day, it had a domed roof and Ionic columns on the porticos. When the infamous Tulsa Race Riot occurred on June 1, 1921, Rev. Kerr opened the basement of this structure to house refugees, primarily women and children, from the Greenwood district. One book about the riot states that the bodies of four dead black men were left at the church door.Hirsch, James S. Riot and Remembrance: America's Worst Race Riot and its Legacy. . 2002. Available from Google Books. Accessed February 19, 2011. =1926 to 2010= The third permanent building was completed in 1926, adjacent to the 1910 structure. This building is shown in the 2007 photo above. Mrs. Kerr dubbed it the \\"high kirk\\" of Tulsa. The General Assembly of the PCUSA held its annual meeting at FPC in 1928. In 1932, Reverend Kerr was elected moderator of the General Assembly. Rev. Kerr retired as Senior Pastor in 1941, and remained as Pastor Emeritus until his death. By 1941, church membership had grown to more than 3,200. The pace of growth continued under his successor, Dr. Edmund Miller, to more than 5,000. In 1948, the church was officially recognized as the second largest Presbyterian church in the United States of America.Cassity, Michael and Danney Goble. Divided Hearts: The Presbyterian Journey Through Oklahoma History. Oklahoma University Press. Norman. 2009. p. 220. Accessed July 30, 2018. The 1910 building was demolished in the early 1950s and replaced by the current C. W. Kerr Building. =2010 to Present= In 2010, FPC began constructing a new facility expansion between 7th and 8th streets and between Boston ave and Cincinnati ave. This expansion included renovations to the historic sanctuary on the west side (on Boston Ave), offices and classrooms (to the north-east), a courtyard in the shape of a Celtic cross, and a multipurpose space for worship services and community events (South-east). The new complex is said to cost $33 million.News on 6 archive, Bryan Emory, \\"Tulsa's First Presbyterian Church Begins $33 Million Construction Project,\\" October 21, 2010.

It was first described scientifically by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott in 1857, based on material collected in Sierra Leone by Adam Afzelius, after whom the species was named. The genus Anubias was described simultaneously, with only A. afzellii belonging to it, which therefore is the type species of the genus. No other species currently placed in the genus Anubias was described earlier (in a different genus) and A. afzelii was therefore the first species of this genus known to science.  Distribution  West Africa: Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali.  Description  Anubias afzelii has elongated, leathery leaf blades that can be up to 35 cm long and 13 cm wide. The leaf stems are generally shorter than the blade. The leaves are set on a creeping and rooting rhizome that is 1‚Äì4 cm thick. The spathe is 3‚Äì7 cm long (exceptionally up to 9 cm long) and has a 13‚Äì32 cm long peduncle. The spadix is 5‚Äì8 cm long (exceptionally up to 12 cm long) and slightly longer than the spathe, so that the tip slightly protrudes from it. The upper part is covered with male flowers, of which the 5-6 stamens are fused into synandria, with the thecae on its sides. The lower part of the spadix is covered with female flowers that are reduced to the ovary and stigma.  Ecology  The plant grows in wet, shady places and flowers from the end of March to July, fruiting from April to September. It generally grows emerged, but can sometimes be completely submerged.  Cultivation  This plant grows best when only partially submersed and not crowded by other plants and is most suited for the paludarium, but can also be used in larger aquariums, where it grows very slowly. It does not require much light. It prefers a temperature range of 22-26 ¬∞C. It can be propagated by dividing the rhizome, but seed-propagation is not difficult either.

It was located in the district of Haid, Ansfelden in Upper Austria. Displaced persons were civilians who were affected by the turmoil of World War II, first with unknown residence. After the Second World War Ansfelden belonged to the American occupation zone. The camp was set up by the American military administration at the existing labor camp of the Wehrmacht from 1945. In September the same year between 8,000 and 9,000 captured SS men were guarded by American soldiers in the camp, who had to continue efforts to expand. In the following years, the camp was populated with displaced Jews from Poland and the homeless from Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Transylvania, Sudeten Germans and Croats. In October 1956, when in Hungary the uprising against Communist rule with was crushed by Russian armored troops, some 700 refugees arrived in the last stocks of the camp.  Location  The camp was located on the present territory of the district Haid and was about half a square kilometer in size. Around 100 properties were in it, most built from wood (barracks), a few were built of stone - primarily for the management and commercial purposes. The barracks were about 270 m¬≤ in size and consisted mostly of one room.  Camp administration  In 1946 the camp administration under subordination of the Upper Austrian government took over the administration of the camp. Emil Lispky was the head of citizens from 1947 to 1964. He was assisted by officers, warehouse workers, employees and the Siedlungsrat. In 1949, the camp was occupied by 4.661 persons, 1.243 were fully occupied, 3.407 people got social welfare. From February to June 1957 the camp was administered by the League of Red Cross Societies.  Social situation in the camp  The people in the camp had different former professions. Most of them were farmers. Artisans and entrepreneurs and members of the clerical occupations were among them. The job-seeking expellees were initially provided only in agriculture and later in the construction industry and much later in the industry. Lots of the camp residents escaped the death camps in their home countries and arrived sick and broken in Austria. Due to the economic situation even the best- qualified people would have small chances for permanent employment, so that many migrated to other countries. The mass of old and sick people and those who could build up an existence remained. For medical care two doctors and three nurses were situated in the camp.  Commercial and business  In 1954 there were many shops in the camp: food, milk, meat, textiles and haberdashery, tailoring, hairdressing and photographer. Many of the inhabitants were into self-sufficiency with pigs, cows and small animals. In January 1949 a music school was opened.  Closure of the camp  In 1953, the LAWOG was founded, whose aim was to eliminate the barrack misery. The local council of Ansfelden decided to become a member of the cooperative. The year 1956 marked the implementation of first housing projects, Haid transformed into one of the largest construction sites in Austria. Step by step, the barracks were torn down and rows of apartment blocks were built up.  Literature and References  * Josef Fuchshuber: Ansfelden einst und jetzt. Teil 2.

Opened in 1892, the station presently forms part of the Rome‚ÄìFormia‚ÄìNaples railway, which was completed in 1927. Previously, and originally, the station was part of the now abandoned Sparanise‚ÄìGaeta railway, the Formia‚ÄìGaeta section of which is currently in the process of being reconstructed. All trains passing through the station are defined as being via Formia, to distinguish them from trains operating on the older and slower Rome‚ÄìNaples railway via Cassino. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Formia-Gaeta railway station is situated at Piazza 4 Novembre, on the north side of the city centre. History The station was opened on 4 May 1892, upon the inauguration of the Sparanise‚ÄìGaeta railway. It was named Formia and was composed initially of two passenger tracks and a small goods yard. The construction of the Rome‚ÄìFormia‚ÄìNaples railway in the 1920s positively changed the destiny of the station and negatively affected the Sparanise‚ÄìGaeta line. For an initial period, the Formia‚ÄìSparanise section of the latter line was used by trains to Rome because the direct route was not yet finished. Upon the completion of the new line, traffic was diverted to that line, and the numbers of travellers on the Formia‚ÄìSparanise section dropped dramatically. Even so, the opening of the Naples‚ÄìFormia‚ÄìRome railway in 1927 transformed the station into an important rail junction. For that reason, it was fitted with additional platforms and greatly expanded. In order to offer a better service on the Sparanise‚ÄìGaeta line, two types of trains were created for that line: first, a group of trains travelling along the Formia‚ÄìSparanise section, and secondly, a shuttle service between Formia and Gaeta. In 1957, the Sparanise‚ÄìFormia section of the Sparanise‚ÄìGaeta line was closed. The more popular passenger services between Formia and Gaeta resisted closure until 1966. A moderate goods service continued on that section until the Sparanise‚ÄìGaeta line was wholly abandoned in 1981. The Formia‚ÄìGaeta section is currently in the process of being reconstructed. On 10 June 2012, the station was renamed from Formia to Formia-Gaeta. Train services The station is served by the following services (incomplete): *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Palermo *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Siracusa *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Taranto *Intercity services Turin - Genoa - La Spezia - Pisa - Livorno - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Night train (Intercity Notte) Rome - Naples - Messina - Siracusa *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Genoa - La Spezia - Pisa - Livorno - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Regional services (Treno Regionale) Rome - Pomezia - Latina - Formia - Minturno - Naples Features View from a passing train Formia's passenger building is a large structure made up of several conjoined sections, ranging from single to three storeys in height. The ground floor level of the central section is faced with marble, and has five arched entrances. The upper levels of that section, and the other sections, are painted an off white colour. Inside the passenger building, at ground level, are a ticketing office, waiting room, bar, restaurant and luggage facilities. The upper floors are used for Trenitalia offices. The station has five through tracks faced by platforms fitted with shelters and subways for passenger service, plus a platform dock once used for a shuttle service between Formia and Gaeta. There is also a goods yard and warehouse, but relatively little goods traffic. Passenger and train movements The station has about 2.5 million passenger movements each year. All InterCity trains passing through the station stop there, but Eurostar Italia trains do not.

Founded as the College of Indigenous Medicine in 1929, it became part of the University of Colombo adopting its current name in 1977. It is a premier center of undergraduate and postgraduate study and research into Ayurveda and Indigenous Medicine and Healthcare. History The original campus signpost in 1929. Administrative Unit of Institute of Indigenous Medicine. IIM was first established as the Swadeshiya Vaidya Vidyalaya (College of Indigenous Medicine) on June 10, 1929 and it was inaugurated by the then Governor of Ceylon, Sir Herbert James Stanley, at the Bauer Building situated at Cotta Road, Borella. Captain (Dr) A.N.N Panikker of the Indian Medical Service who had qualified in western medicine in Edinburgh and possessed a sound training in Ayurveda sciences was invited to the newly established College by the Government as its first Principal. Similarly, Dr H.M. Jaffer and Dr H. Ahamed were also brought down from India to develop Unani system of medicine. In 1961, the Ayurveda Act No. 31 of 1961 was enacted by repealing the Indigenous Medical Ordinance No. 17 of 1941 and the College was renamed as the Government College of Indigenous Medicine and came under the management of the College and Hospital Board. This was a step taken to uphold the quality of ayurveda healthcare delivery and the systems of education in Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. In 1977, the College of Indigenous Medicine was renamed as the Institute of Indigenous Medicine and affiliated to the University of Colombo under the University Act No. 1 of 1972. This was done by the Institute of Ayurveda Statute No. 1 of 1977, published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary bearing number 258 of March 30, 1977. The objective of this step was to produce qualified medical practitioners in the field of Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medical systems. Institute of Indigenous Medicine Ordinance No. 7 of 1979 published in the Government Gazettee Extraordinary bearing No. 67/14 dated December 21, 1979 under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.

See the IUPAC recommendation definition as a means of coupling capillary electrophoresis to mass spectrometry in which a liquid reservoir surrounds the separation capillary and transfer capillary to the mass spectrometer. The reservoir provides electrical contact for the capillary electrophoresis. The term liquid junction interface has also been used by Henry M. Fales and coworkers for ion sources where the analyte is in direct contact with the high voltage supply. This includes in particular nanospray ion sources where a wire made of stainless steel, gold or other conducting material makes contact with the sample solution inside uncoated spray capillaries. The principle is also applied when a stainless steel union connects a chromatography outlet to a spray capillary. Its use has a number of advantages with respect to simplification of interface or source design, easy handling and cost. Electrolysis effects have to be controlled. Liquid junction interfaces have been used for on-line desalting in conjunction with mass spectrometry. Thereby, chromatographic material such as C18 phase was directly placed in the flow path coming from a pump or an HPLC device. In a variation of the method, fine capillaries were densely packed with chromatographic phase to form separation columns and act as electrospray capillaries at the same time. This method is commonly employed in many proteomics laboratories. It is of note that experimental designs where the direct application of high voltages to liquids to form aerosols and sprays has been described as early as 1917 in the context of not ionization, but atomization of liquids.

Early life and family Suntharalingam was born on 19 August 1895. He was the son of Chellappah and Meenachchi from Urumpirai in northern Ceylon. He was educated at St. John's College, Jaffna and St. Joseph's College, Colombo. In 1914 he entered the University of London from where he graduated with a B.Sc. honours degree in mathematics. He then went on to Balliol College, Oxford from where he was awarded a double first in mathematics tripos. Suntharalingam hailed from a distinguished family and had four eminent brothers: C. Nagalingam, a Supreme Court judge, was acting Governor-General of Ceylon in 1954; C. Panchalingam was a medical doctor; C. Amirthalingam was Director of Fisheries; and C. Thiagalingam was a leading lawyer. Suntharalingam married Kanagambikai Ambal, daughter of M. Kanagasabi. They had two sons (Gnanalingam and Sathyalingam) and four daughters (Lingambikai, Lingavathy, Lingamani and Lingeswari). Career The first Cabinet of independent Ceylon. Suntharalingam is on the far left. Suntharalingam was selected by the Indian Civil Service but chose instead to join the Ceylon Civil Service in 1920. He resigned from the civil service to become vice principal of Ananda College. He then joined Ceylon University College as professor and first chair of mathematics. He was called to the Bar from Gray's Inn in 1920, becoming an advocate and practising law in Ceylon. Becoming interested in politics, Suntharalingam retired in 1940 and entered politics. He tried unsuccessfully to enter the State Council during by-elections in 1943 and 1944. He stood as an independent candidate in Vavuniya at the 1947 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament. He was persuaded to join the United National Party led government and on 26 September 1947 he was sworn in as Minister of Trade and Commerce. He supported the controversial Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 which deprived citizenship to 11% of the Ceylon's population but when division was called on the second reading of the Indian and Pakistani Residents Citizenship Bill on 10 December 1948, Suntharalingam walked out of Parliament. Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake asked for an explanation but Suntharalingam resigned from his ministerial position instead. Suntharalingam became a champion for the rights of Ceylon's Indian Tamils who had been made stateless and disenfranchised by Sinhalese dominated governments after independence. He observed that \\"if the Buddha were to come to the country today, he himself would be deported\\" (Buddha was from India, the Sinhalese were Buddhists). Suntharalingam resigned from Parliament in 1951 as a protest against the adoption of the Sinhala kodiya (flag) as the national flag. He was the only candidate in the ensuing by-election and consequently returned to Parliament. He was re-elected at the 1952 parliamentary election. Suntharalingam vehemently opposed the attempts to make Sinhala the sole official language of Ceylon, stating during the June 1955 throne speech that, if the changes went ahead, Tamils would demand \\"a separate independent autonomous state of 'Tamil Ilankai' composed of Tamil speaking peoples in Ceylon\\". He boycotted Parliament from August 1955 in protest against the Sinhala Only Act. After three months of absence he forfeited his seat in Parliament. He won the ensuing by-election and returned to Parliament. He was re-elected at the 1956 parliamentary election. Suntharalingam founded the Eela Thamil Ottrumai Munnani (Unity Front of Eelam Tamils) in 1959. At the March 1960 parliamentary election Suntharalingam, contesting as an independent as the Eela Thamil Ottrumai Munnani wasn't a registered party, was defeated by T. Sivasithamparam, another independent candidate. Suntharalingam published Eylom: Beginning of the Freedom Struggle; Dozens Documents in 1963 in which he became one of the first Ceylon Tamils to call for an independent Tamil state, which he called Eylom: Suntharalingam contested the 1965 parliamentary election as an independent candidate but was defeated by the All Ceylon Tamil Congress candidate T. Sivasithamparam. He contested the 1970 parliamentary election as an independent candidate in Kankesanthurai but was defeated by the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi candidate S. J. V. Chelvanayakam.

On Autumn of the same year, he had become the member of Siluete (The Silhouettes), but on mid-1964 he left the band, forming a band also called Siluete. For a while, there were two groups working under the same name, but the case was settled after a court verdict after which Sovilj lost the right to use the name. However, he did manage to keep the name somewhat similar by renaming it to Tomi Sovilj i Njegove Siluete. At the time, the band beside him featured the former Bele Zvezde members Slobodan Saniƒçanin (guitar), Branislav Rakoƒçeviƒá (bass), Milorad Tomiƒá (guitar) and √êino Maljokoviƒá (drums). Later on, the band members were also Borislav √êurkoviƒá (rhythm guitar), Boba Voratoviƒá (bass) and Hamadija Vladoviƒá (drums). Owing to their attractive performances, they had become one of the most popular live acts in Belgrade, which provided them with often live performances at the Belgrade Ma≈æestik hotel tea parties and at the cafe bar Terazije. In 1966, the band released their debut EP Vule bule through Diskos, featuring the songs \\"Vule bule\\", a cover version of the Sam The Sham and The Pharaos song \\"Wooly Bully\\", \\"Hej, o Slupi\\", a cover of The McCoys song \\"Hang On Sloopy\\", \\"D≈æini D≈æini\\", a cover Little Richard's \\"Jenny, Jenny\\", all three having lyrics rewritten in Serbian language, and a cover of the starogradska muzika standard \\"Za jedan ƒçasak radosti\\" (\\"For a Moment of Joy\\"), written by Darko Kraljiƒá. The release had been sold in more than fifty thousand copies, thus becoming a silver record. On Autumn of the same year, Sovilj went to serve the Yugoslav People's Army, and was temporarily replaced by the former Juniori (The Juniors) vocalist Du≈°an Preleviƒá. On his return, the band released their second EP Stoj D≈æoni featuring the title track, a cover version of Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\", which had also reached high sales and went silver. After the EP release, the band popularity had slowly decreased and Sovilj disbanded the band in 1970.  Post-breakup  After the band disbandment, Sovilj recorded a solo single \\"Nojeva barka\\" (\\"Noah's Arc\\"), with \\"Plava pesma\\" (\\"A Blue Song\\") as the single B-side, released by Diskos in 1970. Afterward, he had moved to the United States where he performed at local clubs. His last recording was the song \\"Veseli vod\\" (\\"A Cheerful Squad\\"), released on the PGP-RTB military music compilation album Kad truba zove (When the Trumpet is Calling) in 1974, and his last live appearance was at the Rock na≈°e mladosti (Rock of Our Youth) concert held at the Belgrade Dom Sindikata in December 1985. He had moved to Switzerland where he currently lives.  Legacy  The song \\"Stoj D≈æoni\\" was covered by Serbian garage rock/punk rock band Partibrejkers on their eponymous debut album in 1985.Partibrejkers I at Discogs In February 1992, as guest on the Partibrejkers concert at the Belgrade Youth Center appeared Johnny Depp, an actor and former The Kids and Rock City Angels member, performing \\"Stoj D≈æoni\\" with the band.

(d. 897) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who, from 882 to 897, controlled Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) as its military governor (Jiedushi). He formed a power bloc with his cousin Zhu Jin, who ruled neighboring Taining Circuit (Ê≥∞ÂØß, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong), and subsequently, they, along with their ally Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), engaged in a lengthy war with their former ally Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) that ravaged the countryside. By 897, all three had been defeated, and Zhu Xuan was captured and executed by Zhu Quanzhong.  Background  It is not known when Zhu Xuan was born, but it is known that he was from Xiayi (‰∏ãÈÇë, in modern Suzhou, Anhui). As of 882, he was serving under Cao Cunshi () the military governor of Tianping Circuit, when Cao was killed in battle when Tianping came under attack by Han Jian the military governor of neighboring Weibo Circuit (È≠èÂçö, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei). Zhu took over the defense of Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture () after Cao's death and was able to prevent it from falling to Han. Then- reigning Emperor Xizong thereafter made Zhu the acting military governor.All of the biographies in the official histories of Tang Dynasty (the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang) and the succeeding Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (the History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five Dynasties) gave accounts that indicated that Zhu had previously served at Pinglu Circuit, but as the chronologies they gave conflicted with each other, stated improbably that Zhu had served under Wang Jingwu (who did not become the military governor of Pinglu until 882), and confused Cao Cunshi with several other military figures at the time also surnamed Cao, the chronology and account of the Zizhi Tongjian will largely be followed here.  Initial rule of Tianping  In 883, Emperor Xizong made Zhu Xuan full military governor of Tianping. Meanwhile, Han Jian continued his siege of Yun Prefecture, but after six months of failing to capture it and Zhu's peace overture to him, abandoned the Yun siege to engage, instead, Zhuge Shuang, whose Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) Han had captured previously but who had recaptured Heyang while Han was sieging Yun. Zhuge defeated Han, who was subsequently assassinated by his own soldiers. Le Xingda succeeded Han at Weibo. In 884, when Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit was under attack by Qin Zongquan the military governor of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), Zhu Quanzhong sought aid from Zhu Xuan. Zhu Xuan sent his cousin Zhu Jin, who was said to be the most ferocious officer in Zhu Xuan's army, to aid Zhu Quanzhong. After Zhu Jin repelled Qin's attack, Zhu Quanzhong, thanking Zhu Xuan, honored Zhu Xuan as an older brother.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. In winter 884, Zhu Xuan made an unsuccessful bid to take over Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). At that time, An Shiru () the military governor of Yicheng had alienated his soldiers by overly entrusting authorities to his officers Xiahou Yan () and Du Biao (). In response, the officer Zhang Xiao () raised a group of 2,000 soldiers, rebelled against An, and attacked Yicheng's capital Hua Prefecture (), forcing An to placate the soldiers by executing Xiahou and Du. Zhu Xuan, wanting to work on seizing Yicheng, sent his cousin Zhu Yu () to induce Zhang into a military confrontation and kill him. Meanwhile, however, Zhu Quanzhong preempted Zhu Xuan by sending his officers Zhu Zhen () and Li Tangbin () to launch a surprise attack on Yicheng. Zhu Zhen and Li were able to surprise An and capture him. Zhu Quanzhong took over Yicheng and made his officer Hu Zhen () acting military governor. In 886, Zhu Jin, under the guise of marrying the daughter of Qi Kerang the military governor of Taining Circuit, ambushed Qi and expelled him, and then took over Taining, allowing Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin to each control one circuit. In 887, Qin launched another major attack on Zhu Quanzhong, who again sought aid from Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin. Both of them personally led troops to aid Zhu Quanzhong. Zhu Quanzhong thus was able to engage Qin with the armies of four circuits (Xuanwu, Yicheng, Tianping, and Taining) and defeat Qin. In gratitude, Zhu Quanzhong again honored Zhu Xuan and also honored Zhu Jin as older brothers.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. However, just later that year, the Zhu Xuan/Zhu Jin alliance with Zhu Quanzhong would break up. Zhu Quanzhong had long had designs on capturing both Tianping and Taining, but found no excuse to attack Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin, given that they had aided him. He thus made up accusations that they had induced Xuanwu soldiers to desert and sent a harshly worded accusation to Zhu Xuan. Zhu Xuan responded with a harsh letter. Zhu Quanzhong used this as an excuse to send Zhu Zhen and Ge Congzhou to attack Tianping's Cao Prefecture (ÊõπÂ∑û, in modern Heze, Shandong); they captured it and executed Cao's prefect Qiu Hongli (). He then attacked Pu Prefecture (ÊøÆÂ∑û, in modern Heze). Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin engaged him but were defeated, barely escaping with their lives. This thus started a war that would not end until Zhu Xuan's death. Later that year, when Zhu Xuan sent his brother Zhu Han () to try to lift the siege on Pu, Zhu Zhen defeated and killed Zhu Han. Zhu Zhen subsequently captured Pu, forcing Zhu Yu (who was then the prefect of Pu) to flee to Yun Prefecture. Zhu Zhen then attacked Yun. Zhu Xuan had Zhu Yu send a letter to Zhu Zhen, falsely claiming to be ready to surrender Yun to him. When Zhu Zhen sent soldiers to enter the city on Zhu Yu's signal, the Xuanwu soldiers fell into a trap set by Zhu Xuan and were massacred. Having suffered this loss, Zhu Zhen retreated. Zhu Xuan subsequently recaptured Cao as well.  War with Zhu Quanzhong  Meanwhile, Zhu Xuan had also entered into an alliance with Zhu Quanzhong's archrival Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). In 891, when Li Keyong's subordinate An Zhijian () began to have secret communications with Zhu Quanzhong, Li Keyong found out and tried to replace him with his adoptive son Li Cunxiao. An, in fear, fled to Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong). Then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) then gave An a commission as an imperial guard general. When An led his soldiers to try to head to the imperial capital Chang'an, Zhu Xuan, as he was in alliance with Li Keyong, ambushed him and killed him, delivering his head to Li Keyong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In 892, Zhu Quanzhong launched another attack on Zhu Xuan, with Zhu Quanzhong's son Zhu Youyu () serving as the forward commander. Zhu Xuan engaged Zhu Youyu and defeated him, forcing him to flee. Zhu Xuan then took over the camp that Zhu Youyu abandoned. When Zhu Quanzhong arrived, he did not realize that Zhu Youyu had fled, and he sent soldiers into the camp with no precautions. Zhu Xuan then attacked, killing a large number of surprised Xuanwu soldiers. Zhu Quanzhong barely escaped with his life, while his deputy military governor Li Fan () was killed. However, despite this major defeat, Zhu Quanzhong was still subsequently able to defeat Zhu Xuan's and Zhu Jin's ally Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (despite Zhu Xuan's, Zhu Jin's, and Li Keyong's attempts to save Shi), forcing Shi to commit suicide and allowing Zhu Quanzhong to take over Ganhua.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. Late in 893, Ge Congzhou attacked Qi Prefecture (ÈΩäÂ∑û, in modern Jinan, Shandong). Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin came to the aid of Qi's prefect Zhu Wei (). In spring 894, however, Zhu Quanzhong personally engaged them and defeated them, killing more than 10,000 Tianping and Taining soldiers. Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin were forced to seek aid from Li Keyong, who sent a small group of elite cavalry soldiers, commanded by his officer An Fushun () and An Fushun's brothers An Fuqing () and An Fuqian (), to aid Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin. However, in 895, when Zhu Quanzhong sent his adoptive son Zhu Yougong () to put Taining's capital Yan Prefecture () under siege and Zhu Xuan tried to aid Zhu Jin, they were ambushed by Zhu Yougong, and An Fushun and An Fuqing were captured. Zhu Quanzhong then personally arrived and defeated Zhu Xuan, forcing Zhu Xuan to return to Yun.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Later in the year, Zhu Xuan attempted to again force Zhu Quanzhong to lift the siege on Yan, by sending his officers He Gui and Liu Cun (), along with Li Keyong's officer He Huaibao (), to attack Cao Prefecture, which had fallen into Zhu Quanzhong's hands by this point. Zhu Quanzhong heard this, and, without Tianping forces' knowledge, set a trap for them and ambushed them; he slaughtered the Tianping soldiers and captured He Gui, Liu, and He Huaibao. He showed them to Zhu Jin and stated to Zhu Jin, \\"Your cousin has already been defeated. Why not surrender?\\" Zhu Jin offered to do so, but requested that Zhu Quanzhong send Zhu Xuan's and Zhu Jin's cousin Zhu Qiong (), who earlier that year had surrendered Qi Prefecture to Zhu Quanzhong, to take control of the Taining circuit seal (signifying surrender of authority). When Zhu Qiong prepared to enter the city, however, Zhu Jin ambushed him and killed him. With his morale deflated, Zhu Quanzhong withdrew. By this point, however, with the constant campaigns against Zhu Quanzhong, it was said that both Tianping and Taining Circuits had been laid waste, with the people unable to grow crops and the circuit treasuries expended. Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin again thought aid from Li Keyong, and Li Keyong sent the officers Shi Yan () and Li Chengsi () to aid them, getting permission from Le Xingda's successor Luo Hongxin for passage through Weibo Circuit. In 896, Li Keyong tried to send more reinforcement through Weibo again, commanded by his adoptive son Li Cunxin. However, Li Cunxin angered Luo by allowing his soldiers to pillage the Weibo countryside, and Luo ambushed and defeated him. When Li Keyong personally attacked Luo, a joint force of Luo's and Zhu Quanzhong's defeated Li Keyong. With the path from Hedong thus cut off, no further reinforcement from Li Keyong could arrive, and it was said that thereafter, the situation became hopeless for Tianping and Taining.  Defeat and death  In 897, Zhu Quanzhong's officers Ge Congzhou and Pang Shigu () jointly again sieged Yun Prefecture. Zhu Xuan ran out of food supplies and decided to dig a deep moat around the city for defensive purposes only, not intending to again engage Zhu Quanzhong's forces. However, Pang soon built a mobile bridge over the moat and crossed it in the dark. He captured the city, forcing Zhu Xuan to flee. When Zhu Xuan reached Zhongdu (‰∏≠ÈÉΩ, in modern Tai'an), the people in the countryside captured him and his wife Lady Rong, and surrendered them to Ge. Zhu Quanzhong subsequently executed Zhu Xuan at Xuanwu's capital Bian Prefecture () and took Lady Rong as a concubine. Zhu Jin, meanwhile, could also not hold Taining, and he fled, along with Shi and Li Chengsi, south to Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) to submit to Huainan's military governor Yang Xingmi, allowing Zhu Quanzhong to take over the entire Yellow River-Huai River region.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261.

In 1965, she decided to shift her area of study focus, pursuing academic endeavors that would give her an opportunity to transition into becoming an art teacher herself. It was at this point that she enrolled in intensive courses on ‚ÄúPedagogia Terapeutica‚Äù in AVEPANE, Caracas, Venezuela, a course on ‚ÄúPedagogia Didactica‚Äù co-sponsored by the University of Jerusalem in Caracas, Venezuela in 1968, and finally a course on ‚ÄúArtes Plasticas Pre-Escolar‚Äù at the Education Ministry in Caracas, Venezuela.

The credit granted an amount equal to 50 percent of qualified track maintenance expenditures and other qualifying railroad infrastructure projects. It was inserted into the tax code by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and was taken into effect on January 1, 2005 with an expiration date of December 31, 2009. Following the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, signed into law on December 17, 2010, the tax credit was retroactively extended for 2010 and the expiration date moved to January 1, 2012. United States fiscal cliff legislation retroactively reinstated the tax credit for 2012 when signed into law January 2, 2013. The tax credit is effective through December 31, 2022. Background Bonded main line 6-bolt rail joint on a segment of rail. In the United States, short line and regional railroads grew exponentially following railroad deregulation in 1980. By 2005 there were more than 500 railroads of this nature, serving small and mid-sized towns that otherwise would have lost rail service. These railroads were responsible for supporting more than 11,000 industrial sites, making them critically important to the local economies of the regions they serve. Maintenance costs for rail infrastructure is often expensive and difficult for low income railroads to cover, as a result some railroads partnered with the companies they served in order to fund maintenance. In order to assist the railroads with maintaining their infrastructure, the Railroad Track Maintenance Tax Credit was created. With more than $330 million in shortline infrastructure investment made annually, credits of $165 million would be placed back in the hands of the railroads and shippers through the tax credit. Highway and road infrastructure is maintained by federal and state governments. Freight rail infrastructure is maintained by private sector investments. Short lines use approximately 184 million gallons of fuel to move 10 million carloads of freight annually. Trucks would require 540 million gallons to move the same freight. Short lines keep 30 million truckloads per year off the highway. American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 The tax credit originated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The credit was capped at $3,500 per mile of track, with eligibility for Class II and Class III railroads, any shippers who transport property using a Class II or Class III railroad, and companies that perform maintenance on or provide material to qualified railroads. With the passing of the act in October 2004, the effective date for the credit was December 31, 2004, with a scheduled expiration date of January 1, 2008, a period of three years. Extensions As scheduled, the tax credits originally expired on January 1, 2008. However, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the tax credit was extended through December 31, 2009. Expiration occurred for the second time as scheduled, however, an extension of the Railroad Maintenance Tax Credit was included in the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Under the new legislation, the credit was retroactively applied to the 2010 tax year and extended through January 1, 2012. United States fiscal cliff legislation retroactively reinstated the tax credit for 2012 when signed into law January 2, 2013. After being delayed, the tax credit was again retroactively applied, this time to the 2018 tax year and extended through December 31, 2022. IRS Form 8900 Internal Revenue Service Form 8900 is used to claim the tax credit by the taxpayer at a maximum of $3500 per short line track mile per year or 50% of qualified railroad track maintenance paid or incurred during the year whichever is less. Form 8900 is used to assign tax credits between eligible taxpayers who have come to an agreement to transfer tax credits. Eligible taxpayers for this credit are short line railroads, transporters who use the railroad property and any taxpayer who furnishes goods and services to a short line railroad. Shareholders or partners of these eligible taxpayer may receive a passthru of these credits on form K-1.

Fray Jacobo de Testera or Jacobo de Tastera was a Franciscan Friar of the 16th century who worked as a missionary to the indigenous peoples of New Spain. Born into a noble family in Bayonne, France he entered the Franciscan order around 1500 and went to Seville where he eventually became palace priest of Charles V. In 1527 he was recruited by Fray Antonio de Ciudad Rodrigo to go to Mexico where he arrived in 1529. Among the first things he witnessed was the beating to death of the indigenous ruler of Tacubaya by Diego Delgadillo for not being able to provide the latter with sufficient workers to construct his palace. Testera became the companion of Archbishop Juan de Zum√°rraga before deciding to dedicate himself to the mission. He started to work closely with Fray Pedro de Gante, creating instructional materials for the natives. He missionized in Michoac√°n and in Atlixco before going to work among the Maya people of Yucat√°n and later among the Nahua people of Huejotzinco, where he spent the last part of his life in the monastery. He was a colleague of Toribio de Benavente \\"Motolinia\\" and a friend of Bartolom√© de las Casas. As he never became fluent in an indigenous language he invented a way of proselytizing with images called Testerian codices employing the rebus system to teach Indians Christian doctrine.

Its motto was \\"Be Less Stupid.\\" History Founded in April 2009 by David Cho and former Gawker editors Choire Sicha and Alex Balk out of Sicha's East Village, Manhattan apartment, after they were laid off by the pop culture magazine Radar, the trio decided to launch their own blog, completely \\"out of pocket with a bare-bones site.\\" The site's name was coined by contributor Tom Scocca, after the small pointed tool used for piercing holes. \\"He‚Äôd always wanted to have a newspaper named The Awl.

After editing the Awl for over almost two years, Matt Buchanan and John Herrman announced their departure from the site in February 2016. In March 2016 it was announced that Silvia Killingsworth would take over the editing position. The Awl was published by John Shankman from 2011 until May 2014, when Michael Macher became publisher. In 2011, David Cho left the Awl to join ESPN- affiliated sports site Grantland. Sister sites The Awl had four sister sites: Splitsider, a comedy website; The Hairpin, a site geared toward women; The Sweethome, a home-furnishings review site; and The Billfold, a blog with a focus on personal finances. Laura Olin edits The Awl's newsletter entitled Everything Changes. Buchanan and Herrman also launched a podcast for the site. The site also launched an app on the Apple App Store called The Awl: Weekend Companion.

He played college football at California. Moala attended Grant Union High School in Del Paso Heights, Sacramento, California, where he was a consensus All-American defensive lineman. High school career Before high school, Moala did not compete in football. In fact, he was competing in rugby, national sport in his native Tonga. He did, however, attend football games of Grant Union High School, where his older brother Sione was playing. After a game in the 2006 season, Pacers head coach Mike Alberghini spotted Moala in the stands, asking the 300-pounder why he did not play varsity football, only to be stunned to hear that Moala was only 13. During his freshman year at Grant Union, Moala was not allowed to participate in varsity football, because California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) rules do not allow students under the age of 15 to compete. Moala instead lined-up on the junior varsity, leading the squad to an undefeated record. As a sophomore, in his first year of varsity football, he started at left guard and was a reserve defensive tackle, finishing the year with 55 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, four quarterback sacks, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. In the CIF Open Division state championship against perennial powerhouse Long Beach Poly, Moala helped Grant to a 25‚Äì20 upset. As a junior, Moala tallied 104 tackles, 36 tackles for loss, and 15 sacks, and returned a blocked kick for a touchdown. He played nose tackle in Grant Union's 3‚Äì5‚Äì3 defense that allowed only 68 points in 13 games, including eight shutouts, and combined for a state-record 77 sacks. However, while riding a 26-game winning streak into the CIF Division II semifinal, Grant Union was upset by Rocklin High School, 19‚Äì21. Still, Moala was named California's Junior Player of the Year, the first lineman to do so since Manny Fernandez of San Lorenzo in 1962. By the end of his junior year, Moala had offers from most of the Pacific-10 Conference. In his senior year, Moala was part of a defense that allowed only 68 points and had eight shutouts, registering a new state-record of 83 sacks (of which Moala contributed 16). Moala also had 131 tackles, five forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, one interception that he returned 25 yards, three blocked punts and a blocked field goal on the season. Grant Union won 13 consecutive games and was ranked among the top teams in nation until being upset by Folsom High School 41‚Äì20 in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division II football championship game. Grant Union had beaten Folsom 49‚Äì14 earlier that season, in a national televised (part of the ESPN \\"Zero Week\\" series) at Prairie View Stadium. } Regarded as a five-star recruit by Scout.com, Moala is listed as the No. 2 defensive tackle prospect in the class of 2011, behind only Anthony Johnson. He and teammate James Sample were selected to play in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. With offers from almost every BCS school, including Alabama, Miami (Fl.), Tennessee, and Florida, Moala was considered Sacramento area's most heavily recruited prospect since Kevin Willhite of Cordova in 1981. He took official visits to Arizona State, Washington, Southern California, and finally California‚ÄìBerkeley. Moala announced his decision to play for the Golden Bears at the Army All-American Bowl, and has been described by recruiters as the \\"jewel\\" of California's 2011 recruiting class. College career Moala arrived at California weighing , but managed to shed almost 70 pounds with a nutrition plan designed specifically for him by Suzanne Nelson, Cal's director of sports performance and nutrition, along with workouts under the supervision of strength and conditioning coach Mike Blasquez. Initially, he was thought to remain in the range, but eventually shed more weight on request of head coach Jeff Tedford.

Frances Blundon was born in Loudoun County, Virginia on April 14, 1867. His training as an apprentice and journeyman carpenter prepared him for a career in home building. Working as an independent builder starting in 1892 his company built approximately 700 homes in D.C. during the first ten years of his career. He often worked alongside his brother, Joseph, who lived with other members of the Blundon family in their Georgetown home. On January 5, 1893 he married Mary Schnebel (born in Virginia, August, 1873) and they gave birth to two sons: Francis Edward and Victor Sylvester. Both eventually became salesmen for the elder Blundon's company. Frances Blundon built many houses in the D.C. area, primarily in the Northwest area of Washington in areas such as Bloomingdale. His brother, Robert Blundon, also worked in real estate sales, who lived with the family in the early 1900s. In their home in the 100 block of W Street, NW, they had a live-in African-American chauffeur named Frank Payner and an African-American live-in cook named Hattie Clement.

History =Smokers become collectors= Some of the earliest prizes were cigarette cards ‚Äî trade cards advertising the product (not to be confused with trading cards) that were inserted into paper packs of cigarettes as stiffeners to protect the contents. Allen and Ginter in the U.S. in 1886, and British company W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1888, were the first tobacco companies to print advertisements and, a couple of years later, lithograph pictures on the cards with an encyclopedic variety of topics from nature to war to sports ‚Äî subjects that appealed to men who smoked.The History of Cartophily By 1900, there were thousands of tobacco card sets manufactured by 300 different companies. Children would stand outside of stores to ask customers who bought cigarettes if they could have their card.A Social History Lesson Up In Smoke ‚Äî Cartophily Following the success of cigarette cards, trade cards were produced by manufacturers of other products and included in the product or handed to the customer by the store clerk at the time of purchase. Other inserts in tobacco included tin litho prizes, called tobacco tags (in plug tobacco), and tobacco silks (popular from 1910 to 1916) that could be collected to put in quilts were inserted in or attached to tobacco tins and sometimes catalogued as cigarette cards.Textile Tobacco Inserts and Premiums Used in American Quilts, and Related Household Articles World War II put an end to cigarette card production due to limited paper resources, and after the war cigarette cards never really made a comeback. After that collectors of prizes from retail products took to collecting tea cards in the UK and bubble gum cards in the US.Cigarette Card Guide (Collectibles) History and Grading =The home run of prizes= The first baseball cards were trade cards featuring the Brooklyn Atlantics produced in 1868 by Peck and Snyder, a sporting goods company that manufactured baseball equipment.

In 1933, Goudey Gum Company of Boston issued baseball cards with players biographies on the backs and was the first to put baseball cards in bubble gum. Bowman Gum of Philadelphia issued its first baseball cards in 1948 and became the biggest issuer of baseball cards from 1948 to 1952. =Topps in cards= Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., now known as The Topps Company, Inc., started inserting trading cards into bubble gum packs in 1950 ‚Äî with such topics as TV and film cowboy Hopalong Cassidy; \\"Bring 'em Back Alive\\" cards featuring Frank Buck on big game hunts in Africa; and All-American football cards. Topps introduced the topic of baseball in trading cards in 1951, and Sy Berger created the first modern baseball card, complete with playing record and statistics, produced by Topps in 1952. The 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card is one of the most desirable baseball cards for collectors.Kendrick's baseball cards find way to Hall Topps purchased the Bowman Gum company in 1956.

Prizes have been inserted into every package of Cracker Jack continuously since 1912.Cracker Jack Collectors Association - History A familiar jingle to people who watched television in the United States in the 1960s and '70s goes \\"Candy-coated popcorn, peanuts and a prize. That's what you get with Cracker Jack!\\" Cracker Jack sales are not what they used to be,NPR: Cracker Jack with much more competition in the snack industry and less creative prizes. The most valuable prizes found in Cracker Jack are the baseball cards distributed in 1914 and 1915. Although most of the prizes recently are just printed paper,Cracker Jack Toys Hold Value in 2004, a complete set of 1914 Cracker Jack baseball cards ‚Äî including the highly sought after \\"Shoeless\\" Joe Jackson and Ty Cobb cards ‚Äî was sold for a record $800,000. =Cereal prizes= W.K. Kellogg was the first to introduce prizes in boxes of cereal beginning in 1906.http://www.chiefmarketer.com/special-reports-chief-marketer/the-good-old- days-01092003 The marketing strategy that he established has produced thousands of different cereal box prizes that have been distributed by the tens of billions.The History of the Kellog company, early Premiums and Incentives of the Kellogg company, and legacy of Will Keith Kellogg, founder of Kellog's The first breakfast cereal prize was The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book given to customers in the stores by merchants at the time of purchase of two packages of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. In 1909, Kellogg's changed the book give-away to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime. By 1912, Kellogg's had distributed 2.5 million Jungleland books. The book underwent various edition changes and was last offered to consumers in 1937. In 1945, Kellogg inserted a prize in the form of a pin-back button into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics. There were 5 series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.Good Old Days: Will Keith Kellogg Kellogg's 3D Baseball and Football Cards produced by Optigraphics were a big hit from 1970 to 1983 in packages of Kellogg's cereals, initially Corn Flakes and later other brands.Kellogg's 3D Baseball Cards Other manufacturers of major brands of cereal (including General Mills, Malt-O-Meal, Nabisco, Nestl√©, Post Foods, and Quaker Oats) followed suit and inserted prizes into boxes of cereal to promote sales and brand loyalty. =Margarine spreads prizes in Europe= Oleomargarine was big business in Germany with hundreds of brands. Since 1920 margarine brands had put prizes in margarine, produced cards similar to tobacco cards of the time, and promoted albums for consumers to place their collections. Prizes made from metal and paper were also used from time to time. The Great Depression of 1929 slowed the previously unbridled development of prizes used in margarine. But after World War II, margarine prizes flourished with many series of printed cards and albums. With the advent of injection molding came the plastic prizes. Cracker Jack had introduced plastic flats in its popcorn confection in the United States in 1948, and beginning in 1950, Fri-Homa, one of the leading German manufacturers of margarine owned by Fritz Homann, inserted prizes into its retail packages to promote brand loyalty.http://www.sammlernet.de/margar/margar01.htm The first plastic margarine prizes were made by SIKU toy company owned by Homann's friend Richard Sieper.http://www.breithaupts.com/toycar83.htm Many margarine brands followed suite. Most of the plastic prizes from German margarine were molded in a light cream color designed to make them look like tiny carved ivory figures ‚Äî though made of polystyrene. These prizes are generically called \\"margarinefiguren\\" (EN: margarine figures), because they originated in oleomargarine products, but they were also found in tobacco and other retail food products. The era of margarine prizes ended in 1954 due to an agreement between German margarine producers to stop using in-pack prizes to promote their products. In the short period between 1950 and 1954, over 258 series (thousands of individual shapes) of plastic prizes were produced. The retail companies that used margarine figures as in-pack prizes included Ei-Fein Margarine, Fri-Homa Margarine, Voss Margarine, Wagner Margarine, Kothe Tobacco, and Mampe Liquor,http://www.bottlepickers.com/bottle_articles1.htm as well as coffee, tea, oatmeal, and shoe cream. Other businesses and attractions that distributed these prizes with purchase were Markt-Apotheke Pharmacies, Siebenhaar and Braunschweig shoe stores, and Berlin and Magdeburg Zoos. For many post-war German children, margarine prizes were the only toys they possessed for years. More than casual collectibles among nostalgic adults today, these tiny plastic loyalty marketing tools are a noteworthy element in the cultural history of German-speaking countries.http://www.mokarex.fr/indexmunsterland_uk.html =Modern prize giant= Frito-Lay is a world icon in the field of in-package prizes. Besides being the current owner of Cracker Jack, the U.S. popcorn confection brand known for the \\"Prize Inside\\",Frito-Lay Company to Acquire Cracker Jack Frito- Lay also regularly includes tazos and tattoos in packages of Lay's chips worldwide. In parts of Latin America, Frito-Lay has even introduced a brand called Cheetos Sorpresa (English: Surprise), which includes a licensed prize (from movies, television, and video games) in every 29‚Äìgram bag. Cheetos Sorpresa Era de Hielo (available in Mexico) included plastic ice molds with characters from the film Ice Age 3 in 45‚Äìgram bags.Cheetos Sorpresa trae para ti una congelada y divertida sorpresa: Le Era de Hielo 3 Game and television series Bakugan Battle Brawlers were featured on tazos in packages of Cheetos and Cheetos Sorpresa from India to Peru in 2009 and 2010.Bakugan Battle Brawlers =Usefulness and collectability= Winter's, a Peruvian brand of chocolates owned by Compa√±√≠a Nacional de Chocolates de Per√∫ S.A., has a confectionery product called Chocopunch that is a cream chocolate in small individual packages. A key promotional aspect of Chocopunch since 1997 has been, packaged with the product, colorful injection molded plastic cucharitas (mini spoons) ‚Äî in the shapes of different characters from movies, television, and video games ‚Äî that are collected as prizes. Chocopunch El Chavo came with two flavors (chocolate and vanilla) combined in one 17 gram container. Packaged with Chocopunch El Chavo were mini spoons in the shape of characters from the syndicated cartoon television series El Chavo del Ocho. The injection molded plastic mini spoons came in 12 different shapes and five different colors, with a total of 60 different items in the collection.  Technical advances  = Sticky business = An important development in prizes is credited to American inventor R. Stanton (Stan) Avery. In 1935, Avery invented a machine to create self-adhesive labels. He started a company called Kum Klean Products to produce them. Self-adhesive labels with pre-printed designs on the front became commonly known as stickers. Today this company is known as the Avery Dennison Corporation and is a major supplier of self-adhesive stamps to the U.S. Postal Service.R. Stanton Avery, 90, Inventor and Producer of Self-Sticking Labels Stickers had their fads beginning in the late 1950s with bumper stickers through the 1960s and children's sticker trading albums of the 1980s. Prizes used in retail products, including breakfast cereal, bubble gum, and Cracker Jack, reflected these trends, and many thousands of examples of colorfully printed self-adhesive works of art have found their way as prizes into packages of retail food and household products. = Plastic injection molding = The invention of a screw injection molding machine by American inventor James Watson Hendry in 1946 changed the world of prizes forever. Thermoplastics could be used to produce toys and other plastic objects much more rapidly, and much more cheaply, because recycled plastic could be remolded using this process. In addition, injection molding for plastics required much less cool-down time for the toys, because the plastic is not completely melted before being injected into the molds. By 1948 the process was widely available, and injection-molded plastic prizes began to appear by the millions in boxes of Cracker Jack, breakfast cereal, and German margarine (1950-1954).:de:Margarinefigur Hendry also developed the first gas-assisted injection molding process in the 1970s, which permitted the production of complex, hollow prizes that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.Injection Molding History = Lenticular technology = Lenticular lens technology, a major development in printing with significant applications in consumer marketing, brought numerous prizes ‚Äî sometimes called tilt cards, flickers, or wiggle pictures ‚Äî including images illustrated to morph from one view to another, show motion, or show depth (3D). Victor Anderson, a leader in the commercial success of lenticular printing, co-founded the Vari-Vue company in New York, which by the 1950s had produced millions of lenticular products, and lenticulars had become a pop culture craze.An Art Form That's Precise But Friendly Enough to Wink Anderson created the first animated advertising button with the \\"I LIKE IKE\\" slogan for Eisenhower's campaign in 1951. In the 1950s, Vari-Vue produced lenticular prizes under the \\"Magic-Motion\\" brand that were inserted into packages of numerous consumer products, including Cracker Jack popcorn confection in the US, and Locatelli's popular Formaggino Mio cheese in Italy.Lenticular History of Lenticular and Related Autosteroscopic Methods Anderson related in a 1996 interview that he had made animated prizes for Cheerios, about 40 million of them, that were stuck to the side of the box, but so many of the prizes were being stolen before they even hit the shelves that Cheerios had to start inserting the prizes inside the boxes. Two Japan companies provided prizes around the world in the 1960s and 70s, Toppan, with their \\"Top Stereo\\" brand, and Dai-Nippon. = Photographic lenticular printing = Lenticulars from the 1940s and 50s had been developed from drawings or cartoon images. In the 1960s, Eastman Kodak Company in Tennessee developed \\"Xograph\\" technology for photographing and printing 3D lenticular images. The first mass-produced ink-printed \\"parallax panoramagram\\" (a black and white 3D photograph of a bust of Thomas Edison) was published in Look Magazine on February 25, 1964 and sold 8 million copies. Look Magazine followed up with the first color 3D lenticular photograph on April 7, 1964. Optigraphics Corporation of Grand Prairie, TexasPerformance Buys Lenticular Leader Optigraphics was formed in 1970 and‚Äîunder the guidance of Victor Anderson, the inventor of the modern lenticular production process who worked well into his 80shttp://www.depthography.com/text/t31.html‚Äîproduced Kellogg's 3D Baseball Cards from 1970 to 1983. Optigraphics produced the lenticular prizes for Cracker Jack in the 1980s, 7-Eleven Slurpee lenticular sports coins from 1983 to 1987, and in 1986 it produced the first set of 3D traditional baseball cards marketed as Sportflics, which ultimately led to the creation of Pinnacle Brands.Baseballcardpedia: Lenticular Printing In 1999 Performance Companies bought Optigraphics after Pinnacle Trading Card Company went bankrupt in 1998.  Prize manufacturers  = Cloudcrest = C. Carey Cloud, sometimes called \\"year-round Santa Claus\\", was best known as a designer and producer of hundreds of different prizes for Cracker Jack from the 1930s through the 1960s through his company Cloudcrest. It is estimated that he created, produced, and delivered to the Cracker Jack Company 700 million toys.http://www.c-carey- cloud.com/cracker-jack.htm At the same time he designed hundreds of premiums for companies such as Brach's Confections, Breck Candy Company, Bunny Bread, Carnival Candies, CoCo Wheats, Johnston Candies and Chocolates, New Orleans Confections Inc, Ovaltine, Pillsbury flour, Post Bran Flakes, Shotwell of Chicago, Thinshell Candies, and more.http://www.c-carey-cloud.com/toys.htm = Nosco Plastics = Nosco Plastics, Inc. (commonly called \\"NOSCO\\", the mark used on its molded products) was the plastics molding division of National Organ Supply Company created in 1934 to make plastic parts for electric organshttp://breyerhistorydiva.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-modernistics- part-1.html and was located at 1701 Gaskell Avenue, Erie, Pennsylvania, 16503.http://www.nycompaniesindex.com/nosco-plastics-inc-4okn/ Beginning in 1948 with the implementation of the newly developed screw injection molding process, NOSCO quickly became a major early producer of tiny plastic toys called \\"slum\\" (very cheap prizes that are bought in bulk, sometimes for as little as $1 a gross or less)http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/slang/carny- slang.html sold to wholesalers as carnival merchandise, used by the millions as prizes in packages of Cracker Jack popcorn confection, and mail-order flats that were heavily advertised in American comic books as \\"100 Toy Soldiers for $1\\" by E. Joseph Cossman & Company. NOSCO also held a number of patents on plastic molded products including mechanical toys, storage containers, pallets, and medical syringes.Acree, Dan. (2010-07-19) 100 Toy Soldiers for $1.25  Texoma Living! Monthly magazine. Texomaliving.com. Retrieved on 2014-08-07. From 1948 through 1960, The Cracker Jack Company at 4800 West 66th Street, Chicago, Illinois,http://www.angelfire.com/mt/crackerjack/beginning.html the largest toy buyer in the world at the time, used many millions of NOSCO toys as prizes in their caramel coated popcorn confection. These include the \\"Animal Stand- ups\\" (CJ Archive #Z-1111) that were marketed by the Levin Brothers ‚Äî as well as the \\"100 Cowboys and Indians\\" set of 12 different figures (CJ Archive #Z-1137) and \\"3 Ring Circus\\" set of 12 different figures (CJ Archive #Z-1154) marketed as mail order items by Cossman & Levine. Other sets made by NOSCO for Cracker Jack include Alphabet Animals set of 26 (Z-1179), People (Occupations) Stand-ups (Z-1124), Spacemen Stand-ups set of 10 (Z-1227), a set of 16 double- sided Stand-ups (Z-1144), and Zodiac Coins set of 12 disks (Z-1182).http://www.crackerjackcollectors.com/Jeffrey_Maxwell/hobbykid/plasticprizes.html#N =R&L; plastics= Rosenhain and Lipmann Pty Ltd (commonly known as \\"R&L;\\") was a plastics company in Melbourne Australia between 1954 and 1977. The company name is a fusion of the surnames of the founders Bruno Lipmann & Kurt Rosenhain.Craig L Hall, Breakfast Barons, Cereal Critters and the Rosenhain & Lipmann Legacy, Sydney, 2002, p.41. R&L; designed and manufactured unique and innovative toys that became hugely popular both in Australia and in the United States.,Making of a cereal thriller (July 27, 2004). The Age. ultimately exporting them around the world. R&L; started out making plastic hardware items. Its first product, a self-adhesive hook, was sold under an exclusive Australia license.Craig L Hall, Breakfast Barons, Cereal Critters and the Rosenhain & Lipmann Legacy, Sydney, 2002, p.43. Its hardware market was complemented by entry into the cereal box prize market with a flexible interconnecting plastic toy link \\"Flex-O-Link\\" in 1958.Craig L Hall, Breakfast Barons, Cereal Critters and the Rosenhain & Lipmann Legacy, Sydney, 2002, p.117. R&L;'s big breakthrough came with Stan Barton joining the firm as engineer, who conceived and developed the idea of miniature model kits, called snap-togethers ‚Äî small plastic model kits that didn't need glue ‚Äî issued in clear glassine bags, inside breakfast cereal boxes. They were used by companies such as Kellogg, Nabisco, Purina Grain Foods, and Sanitarium Health Food Company.Craig L Hall, Breakfast Barons, Cereal Critters and the Rosenhain & Lipmann Legacy, Sydney, 2002 Space Nits were found in retail packages of both Kellogg's cereals and Cracker Jack popcorn confection. During the company's 18-year run, over 70 different sets were released and it is estimated that about one billion R&L; toys were delivered around the world.Divola, Barry (2004). Searching for Kingly Critter: a deliciously different tale of obsession and nostalgia. Published by ABC Books, Sydney. . R & L's success was based upon unique toy designs and uncompromising engineering quality. However, the tide of success turned with the oil price shocks of the 1970s which sent the price of the raw material, plastic, up 300% in 5 years.Craig L Hall, Breakfast Barons, Cereal Critters and the Rosenhain & Lipmann Legacy, Sydney, 2002, p.74. Surprisingly too, the arrival of colour television saw cereal companies spend their marketing budgets on television advertising and not plastic inserts. Becoming unprofitable, R&L; factory equipment and contents were sold off to a company in Mexico in 1977. This machinery was used to re-issue several series under the name \\"Tinykins\\". Although structurally the same, many colors varied and were brighter than the originals. The plastic and texture was also of a lesser quality. Tinykins flooded the market and are often mistaken for, or sold as, R&L; originals.Tony's Trading Site. My Collection of Crater Critters.

It is one of the most popular and recognizable songs in the musical, and Robert Preston's performance in the film is admired. Willson considered eliminating a long piece of dialogue from his draft of The Music Man about the serious trouble facing River City parents. Willson realized it sounded like a lyric and transformed it into \\"Ya Got Trouble\\".Bloom, Ken and Vlastnik, Frank. Broadway Musicals: The 101 Greatest Shows of all Time, pp. 215-16. Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, New York, 2004. Content A smooth-talking, yet corrupt, traveling salesman takes up the occupation of a musical-instrument dealer and tries to convince the citizens of River City, Iowa, to fund his idea for a boys' marching band by playing on their fears of youth corruption, represented by a new pocket pool table in the local billiard hall. The song is his slippery slope argument of what could happen should the citizens fail to recognize the danger and not follow his suggestion for a more wholesome activity. The song contains many types of invalid argumentation (\\"trouble starts with t, which rhymes with p, which stands for pool\\"). Title variations The song is sometimes listed as \\"(Ya Got) Trouble\\". The original Broadway cast album lists the song title as \\"Trouble\\", both on the record jacket and label. \\"You Got Trouble\\" is a common misspelling of the song title. Notable covers A fully arranged cover of the song appears on the 1967 eponymous debut album of the sunshine pop band Spanky and Our Gang. A bar of the song's main chorus is featured in a mid-1970s episode of the children's TV series \\"The Electric Company.\\" The song was part of a skit featuring an irritable police commissioner (Jim Boyd) and several of his inept recruits (Morgan Freeman, Luis Avalos and Skip Hinnant). American humorist, satirist, and advertising innovator Stan Freberg covered the song for Capitol Records in 1958. Though Freberg often directly parodied songs (or \\"kidded\\" them, in his phrase), his recording of \\"Ya Got Trouble\\" was a straightforward recording of the song, arranged and conducted by his longtime collaborator Billy May. Freberg wrote that the subtle parody in the recording lay in the fact that it was recorded in an empty concert hall, as were many Broadway soundtrack albums, with the characteristic echo of such large empty space. Also, during the 2010 Writers Guild Awards, Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy, did a parody of the song entitled \\"Ya Got Trouble\\" but it was about unscripted shows. MacFarlane also sang the song in his second BBC Proms appearance with The John Wilson Orchestra, \\"Prom 59: The Broadway Sound\\", on August 27, 2012. In an episode of the 1980s TV series Fame, Morgan Stevens, in character as David Reardon, performed the selection with the assistances of some of the regular cast. In an episode of the TV series The Simpsons, Marge vs. the Monorail, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley convinces the townspeople to buy a city monorail with a parody of this song. When hosting the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards, Conan O'Brien sang a parody of the song about how NBC's ratings were starting to slip at the time. In a 2016 episode of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, \\"Josh and I Work on a Case,\\" the eponymous character Rebecca cajoles the tenants of an apartment complex to sue their landlord in a parody of this song entitled \\"Cold Showers Lead to Crack\\".

According to the Lithuanian census of 2011, it had 343 residents. Its alternate names include Sy≈Çgudyszki (Polish language), Saldutishkis, Trunkuny, and Saldati≈°kio.United States Board on Geographic Names. Salduti≈°kis. Accessed 2011-03-04. History The village was first mentioned in the late 18th century, when the property and manor of the Ja≈Çowiecki (Jaloveckis) family were recorded. Two of its most famous members were General Boles≈Çaw Ja≈Çowiecki (Boleslovas Jaloveckis; died in 1917) and his son Mieczys≈Çaw (1876‚Äì1967), a diplomat for the interwar Polish government of the Second Polish Republic and a known agronomist. Boles≈Çaw established a park, rich in tree variety. The settlement began to grow after a narrow gauge railway between Panevƒó≈æys and ≈†venƒçionƒóliai was built in 1899. Its train station was built in the traditional Zakopane Style of Architecture. The Panevƒó≈æys-Salduti≈°kis railway was the object of the 1938‚Äì1939 Panevezys-Saldutiskis Railway Case of the Permanent Court of International Justice between Estonia and Lithuania. During World War I, the manor was abandoned and looted. In the aftermath of World War I, the village became part of the independent Lithuanian state. In the independent Lithuania, Ja≈Çowiecki family was unable to regain their estates, and Mieczys≈Çaw settled in Poland. In the 1920s the former Ja≈Çowiecki's manor was converted into administrative offices and a primary school while the former barn was converted into a parish church. According to the 1923 census, there were 79 residents in Salduti≈°kis. As the settlement grew, an agricultural school and foresters office was moved into the town. A sawmill provided electricity for the town and surrounding settlements. On July 3 and August 4, 1941, an Einsatzgruppen of Germans and Lithuanians nationalists executed the Jews from Salduti≈°kis. The remaining Jews from the city were shot at the military training grounds in ≈†venƒçionƒóliai.http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page/8/item/113/ After World War II, several collective farms (kolkhozy) were established and primary school was converted into secondary. Salduti≈°kis had 309 residents in 1957, 388 in 1970, and 434 in 1979. On July 30, 2002, the President of Lithuania confirmed coat of arms of the town. The arms depict silver deer with two pine branches with golden cones instead of antlers. These are symbols of the nearby Labanoras Forest, the largest forest in Lithuania.

It was established in 1894.http://www.caer- hs.powys.sch.uk/website/SchoolHistory/School%20History.htm Spanish and French are offered up to A-Level, and A-Level students are also given the option of learning either Italian, German, Russian or Mandarin through the Welsh Baccalaureate Qualification scheme, a qualification which is designed to enhance Welsh pupils' key skills and appreciation of the country's heritage and history. 54% of the pupils are fluent Welsh speakers according to the latest Estyn inspection report. Academics The school has excelled in examination results, both at GCSE and A-Level. In the inspection, it was noted that the school possessed a number of \\"outstanding features\\", including support for those with difficulty of learning. Caereinion High School achieved all Grade 2 attributes, bar one category which was given a Grade 3. The school includes a 5√ó60 officer. 5√ó60 is a scheme designed for schools in the country to encourage young people to take part in 60 minutes of physical activity daily. Next door to the school is the town's leisure centre, consisting of squash courts, a fitness suite, a gymnasium and a sports hall. The school has a sound relationship with the centre's management, and pupils use the centre's facilities for PE lessons, as well as for extra-curricular activities during the lunch hour and after school. The school has had great success at the annual Urdd Eisteddfod, a competitive cultural event which encompasses literature and music performances, in choral, orchestral, and recitation competitions. Sports Sport has become a prominent feature of the school's face. The under-18 boys' team won the Welsh School's Minute Maid Cup in 2009 (the school winning 4-1 on penalties). The team that was victorious starred two young men who went on to be capped for Welsh School's under 18s; Steffan Jones and Ross Frame, both of Llanfair Caereinion, enjoyed subsequent successes on the international level. Katie Griffiths has gone on to represent Wales in hockey and football, while Huw Jones enjoys a so far successful international career in table tennis, and Aled Humphreys competes in bowls. Catrin Thomas has displayed outstanding achievements in the field of athletics, winning several gold and silver medals. Owain Williams has represented North Wales and Powys in rugby union at the under 17s level, and many youngsters including James Harding represent the North Wales team at the under 18s level. Collaboration The school collaborates with the nearby Llanfyllin High School and Welshpool High School in the Trisgol partnership. This involves the sharing of A-level courses with the aim of increasing the number of courses on offer. A number of sixth-form students travel to the other schools for particular courses, as well as students from the other schools travelling to Caereinion. Students at the school also travel to NPTC's Newtown campus to access vocational courses.

It is as important as all other statistical techniques because it permits quick analysis, recognition, and enhancement of job responsibilities, tasks, performance competencies, and organizational work flows. Other names used for it are 'activity sampling', 'occurrence sampling', and 'ratio delay study'. In a work sampling study, a large number of observations are made of the workers over an extended period of time. For statistical accuracy, the observations must be taken at random times during the period of study, and the period must be representative of the types of activities performed by the subjects. One important usage of the work sampling technique is the determination of the standard time for a manual manufacturing task. Similar techniques for calculating the standard time are time study, standard data, and predetermined motion time systems.........  Characteristics of work sampling study  The study of work sampling has some general characteristics related to the work condition: *One of them is the sufficient time available to perform the study. A work sampling study usually requires a substantial period of time to complete. There must be enough time available (several weeks or more) to conduct the study. *Another characteristic is multiple workers. Work sampling is commonly used to study the activities of multiple workers rather than one worker. *The third characteristic is long cycle time. The job covered in the study has relatively a long cycle time. *The last condition is the non- repetitive work cycles. The work is not highly repetitive. The jobs consist of various tasks rather than a single repetitive task. However, it must be possible to classify the work activities into a distinct number of categories.  Steps in conducting a work sampling study  There are several recommended steps when starting to prepare a work sampling study: # Define the manufacturing tasks for which the standard time is to be determined. # Define the task elements. These are the defined broken-down steps of the task that will be observed during the study. Since a worker is going to be observed, additional categories will likely be included as well, such as \\"idle\\", \\"waiting for work\\", and \\"absent\\". # Design the study. This includes designing the forms that will be used to record the observations, determining how many observations will be required, deciding on the number of days or shifts to be included in the study, scheduling the observations, and finally determining the number of observers needed. # Identify the observers who will do the sampling. # Start the study. All those who are affected by the study should be informed about it. # Make random visits to the plant and collect the observations. # After completing the study, analyze and present the results. This is done by preparing a report that summarizes and analyzes all data and making recommendations when required. Determining the number of observations needed in work sampling After the work elements are defined, the number of observations for the desired accuracy at the desired confidence level must be determined. The formula used in this method is: sigma_P=sqrt{frac{pq}{n}} n=frac{pq}{{sigma_P}^2} sigma_P= standard error of proportion p= percentage of idle time q= percentage of working time n= number of observations Additional applications of work sampling Work sampling was initially developed for determining time allocation among workers' tasks in manufacturing environments. However, the technique has also been applied more broadly to examine work in a number of different environments, such as healthcare and construction. More recently, in the academic fields of organizational psychology and organizational behaviour, the basic technique has been developed into a detailed job analysis method for examining a range of different research questions.

Biography Bernard van Praag was born in 1939 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, as the son of Jonas Andries and Henriette Emma van Praag. He grew up in Bloemendaal. He studied econometrics at the University of Amsterdam, where he received a Ph.D. degree cum laude in 1968. Van Praag was appointed professor at the Free University of Brussels in 1969, then in 1970 associate professor at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, professor of economics at the University of Leiden (1972), professor at Erasmus University (1984), professor in \\"applied economic research\\" at the University of Amsterdam (1992), and managing director of the Foundation for Economic Research from 1992 to 2000. In 2000 he became Distinguished University Professor at the University of Amsterdam. Van Praag was the founding president of the European Society for Population Economics (ESPE), and co-editor of the Journal for Population Economics and Journal of Health Economics. He was a member of the Dutch Social Economic Council. In 1988-1992 he was a member of the (Dutch) Scientific Council for Government Policy, a prominent advisory body for the Dutch government on long term policy issues. He was the responsible council member for their report \\"Ouderen voor Ouderen\\", which initiated the demographic discussion on the aging society in the Netherlands. He has published in a wide range of journals, including the Review of Economics and Statistics, European Economic Review, Journal of Public Economics, Journal of Population Economics, Econometrica, Psychometrika, Journal of Econometrics, Journal of Applied Econometrics, Review of Income and Wealth, Journal of Human Resources, Journal of Economic Psychology, Journal of Health Economics, Health Economics, Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, the Economic Journal, Journal of Happiness Studies, Journal of Income Distribution, and Journal of Economic Inequality. He was mentioned in the top 5% of economics authors by Repec, as of September 2012.https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html Work =Leyden school= During his Leyden period (1972‚Äì84), Van Praag initiated and acted as leader of the Leyden School project, his main co-authors being Arie Kapteyn and Aldi Hagenaars. Van Praag argued in his Ph.D. dissertation (1968) that utility of money (called by Van Praag the \\"individual welfare function of income\\", WFI) could be seen as a cardinal concept. Based on this idea he devised a specific question module, the Income Evaluation Question (IEQ), intended to ask respondents which income level they would call \\"good\\", \\"sufficient\\", \\"bad\\", etc. The IEQ has been posed since 1970 to many thousands of respondents in large-scale surveys. Van Praag estimated the WFI for thousands of individuals in most countries of Western Europe. He discovered a preference drift (comparable to the hedonic treadmill), whereby the WFI of the individual depends on current income and shifts with rising income to the right. Kapteyn and Van Praag discovered reference drift, which means that individual welfare depends on the income of the reference group members. The analysis led to the estimation of subjective family equivalence scales and subjective definitions of poverty. He carried out several large-scale poverty studies for the European Union. Van Praag has also been active on econometric methodology, labour and health economics, conjoint or vignette analysis and the economics of ageing. The Leyden School may be seen as a precursor of modern happiness economics by about twenty years. In the words of Claudia Senik when reviewing Happiness Quantified: : 'Van Praag is one of the leading and inaugural figures of the field. In the early 1970s, Professor van Praag, with other colleagues, started this stream of the literature at the University of Leyden, hence the ‚ÄúLeyden School‚Äù denomination. With the current success of ‚Äúhappiness studies‚Äù, economists are re-discovering the contributions and intuitions of the Leyden school.' Andrew Clark et al. in their authoritative survey comparing Van Praag's work with the happiness papers from 1990 onwards write: : 'One method that essentially inverts the question is that of the Welfare Function of Income, associated with the Leyden school in the Netherlands and, particularly, with Van Praag. This predates the work on satisfaction by some years, with the first published article being Van Praag (1971).' =Recent research= After a relative calm period, during which Van Praag was engaged in semi-commercial research, Van Praag resumed his academic research at the end of the 1990s. He enriched his research by adopting the satisfaction question module used by modern happiness economists. His main new results are the application of happiness economics with Barbara Baarsma to estimate shadow prices of airplane-noise hindrance near Amsterdam Airport, which method may be used for estimating the shadow prices of other external effects as well and the development of a two-layer model with Frijters and Ferrer-i-Carbonell, where life satisfaction is seen as an aggregate of domain satisfactions. He published in 2004 the comprehensive monograph Happiness Quantified, a Satisfaction Calculus Approach (with Ada Ferrer-i-Carbonell), which was revised in 2008 and translated into Chinese in 2010. He is a regular contributor to the Dutch dailies NRC Handelsblad and de Volkskrant and the professional weekly Economisch-Statistische Berichten. Honours Van Praag is a Fellow Emeritus of the European Economic Association, member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (Koninklijke Nederlandse Academie van Wetenschappen) since 1999, elected as a member of the International Statistical Institute, member of the Royal Dutch Society of Sciences (Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij van Wetenschappen), Fellow of CESifo Munich, IZA Bonn, DIW Berlin, AIAS Amsterdam, Honorary Fellow and chairman‚Äìfounder (1986) of the Tinbergen Institute.

The interstate highway system built through Cedar Creek and the nearby communities of Snowville and Park Valley. Cedar Creek was abandoned when weather conditions made farming difficult. History Cedar Creek was established in the 1860s as a farming community and was named after a creek that ran north of the town. By the early 20th century, about 20 families lived in Cedar Creek. A school that also served as a church was constructed in town, as was an inn, a service station, and a store. Some activities, including dances, theater performances, and talent shows, were held in the school. The town's mail was delivered to a home rather than to a post office. When the interstate highway system was developed, it ran from Snowville to Cedar Creek, then to nearby Park Valley. Native Americans were often seen near town, collecting nuts and hunting rabbits. The town's school teacher was considered one of the smartest people in town, and the residents of Cedar Creek often came to her for farming advice. In the 1920s, dry summers and cold winters made farming difficult. People then left town, and by the end of the decade, Cedar Creek was abandoned. Only a few buildings remain today.

The studio version was released on the group's 1974 compilation album Odds and Sods (reissued in 1998). Live versions appear on Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, View from a Backstage Pass, Greatest Hits Live, Thirty Years of Maximum R&B;, and both reissues of Who's Next. Background One of the main chord progressions in \\"Naked Eye\\" can be traced to the spring and summer of 1969 when the band was touring in support of the Tommy album. The three-chord riff (F6/9-Cadd9-G) was sometimes played during the group's very long and improvised versions of \\"Magic Bus\\" at that time, then later in expanded jams during \\"My Generation\\", as heard in the Live at Leeds version. Eventually Townshend composed an entire song around this progression. \\"Naked Eye\\" was originally planned to be released on a 1970 Who EP entitled 6 ft. Wide Garage, 7 ft. Wide Car, a collection which was also to include \\"Water\\", \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\", and \\"Postcard.\\" There were also plans to release a live version of the song, but neither plan materialized. Recording The band likely began recording the song in 1970 during sessions for an EP that was eventually aborted when Townshend began focusing on his Lifehouse rock opera (these same sessions also yielded ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Even Know Myself‚Äù, ‚ÄúWater‚Äù, ‚ÄúPostcard‚Äù, and ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm a Farmer‚Äù). It was eventually completed in the spring of 1971 during sessions for Who's Next, which included several numbers originally intended for Lifehouse. Evidence that the piece had been started but not completed can be heard in a BBC performance of the song from December 1970 in which the band mimed to the studio recording, which was faded out before the third verse (then likely not yet recorded) could be heard. The version on the remastered edition of Odds and Sods is longer than the original, which had been slightly edited. Live history \\"Naked Eye\\" was debuted in live form during the band's American tour in June‚ÄìJuly 1970, generally as part of long medleys during \\"My Generation\\". These versions never included the third verse, which wasn't heard until 1971. The song was a regular part of the group's act in 1971 and 1972, again usually following ‚ÄúMy Generation‚Äù, then became a frequent encore in 1973-74. It appeared less often in the band's 1975-76 shows and was played for the last time with Keith Moon during the group's concert at Madison Square Garden in New York on March 11, 1976. Since then it has been performed during each era of the band's existence, though never regularly. The song has been played in varying arrangements through the years, but never in the exact arrangement of the original studio recording. Versions from 1996-2000 featured Roger Daltrey singing the first verse unaccompanied while playing acoustic guitar.

He played college football at Ohio State and was signed by the Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2010 and won Super Bowl XLVI with them against the Patriots. Early years and college career Ballard grew up in Springboro, Ohio. He went to Springboro High School and started on both sides of the ball in football and started on the basketball team. He attended Ohio State University, where he caught 34 passes for 377 yards, averaging 11.1 yards per catch, and 3 touchdowns. Professional career =New York Giants= Ballard was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent following the 2010 NFL Draft on April 25, 2010. He was waived/injured after suffering a hamstring injury during training camp on August 19. He was re-signed to the team's practice squad on September 5. He was promoted to the active roster on November 20. He played in the game against the Philadelphia Eagles the following day, playing eights snaps. He was waived on November 23, and re-signed to the practice squad the following day. He was promoted to the active roster again on December 16. Ballard played in the November 6, 2011 game against the New England Patriots (5-2) at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, finishing the day with 67 receiving yards, including a 28-yard catch on 3rd and 10 with :51 left and the subsequent 1-yard touchdown catch with just 17 seconds to play. The Giants won the game 24-20 to maintain a 2-game lead in the NFC East and hand the Patriots their second straight loss for the first time since 2009 (and first in 21 consecutive games at home). Ballard played in Super Bowl XLVI but left in the second half with a torn ACL in his left knee. After leaving the field, he attempted to run and cut on the sideline, but collapsed unable to reach full speed. Replacing Ballard was teammate Bear Pascoe, who finished the game with 4 catches for 33 receiving yards. The Giants defeated the Patriots in the Super Bowl 21-17. =New England Patriots= While Ballard was recovering from his ACL injury, the Giants decided to place him on injured reserve. Because they decided to do so during the offseason, NFL rules required that he be exposed to waiver claims before they could do so. While Ballard and his agent expected that he would clear waivers, New England claimed him off waivers on June 12, 2012. He spent the entire 2012 regular season on the Physically Unable to Perform list. On August 30, 2013 Ballard was informed of his release. =Arizona Cardinals= After cutting rookie tight end D. C. Jefferson due to his arrest, the Cardinals agreed to terms with Ballard on November 4, 2013. Ballard was expected to split time with tight ends Jim Dray and Rob Housler. On December 15, 2013, Ballard caught his first touchdown pass in two years in a win against the Tennessee Titans. He played in eight games and caught seven passes for 75 yards and two touchdowns. On August 6, 2014, Ballard announced his retirement from the NFL because \\"after sustaining a serious knee injury while playing for the New York Giants in the Super Bowl, my body never felt the same. Having a quality of life after football is very important to me and I have witnessed it taken away from others.\\"  Life after football  Ballard is a real estate agent with Howard Hanna Real Estate Services in Upper Arlington, Ohio.

It is now the Monticello Heritage and Cultural Center. It is the only church in Iowa designed by nationally prominent architects Cram & Ferguson, who specialized in ecclesiastical architecture. The church congregation sought high design quality and, as recorded in the NRHP nomination for the church, the local newspaper reported in 1949 that > It was felt that the church building could never be better than its design > so an effort was made to secure the ablest architects available and the > world famous firm of Cram & Ferguson of Boston were selected.

This is, however, their first church in Iowa. > (Monticello Express 1949 \\"Drawing of the New Methodist Church\\") How the building committee of St. Luke's Church got connected to the Boston architectural firm is not known, but may have been through Rev. Dr. Daniel L. Marsh (1880-1968). Marsh, president of Methodist-affiliated Boston University, obtained Cram & Ferguson to design Marsh Chapel and many other campus buildings which were widely covered in Methodist publications. The congregation was founded in 1858 and built its first church, on this site, in 1863, at cost of $1,750.00. The original was replaced in 1899 by a second that suffered design problems. The 1949-1950 church is the third Methodist church. After its completion the congregation had 350 members, but eventually declined and in the 1990s joined up with the local Congregational church to form the United Church of Monticello. The combined church alternated worship services in the two churches for a time. The St. Luke's church was eventually provided to the Monticello Heritage and Cultural Center, a group interested in its preservation, which obtained a grant from the Historic Site Preservation Grant Program of the State Historical Society of Iowa in 2000, enabling it to purchase the property. In 2001, the building was being used as a performance venue, for cultural programs, and as a history museum. with There was a design challenge in the small church's requirement for a large community room, as a steeply pitched roof consistent with Late Gothic Revival styling could have required a very high roofline, higher than on the main church area. This was solved by designing a somewhat complex roof system that had ups and downs. Gothic Revival styling is also apparent in building materials choices and in many architectural details. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. It was deemed significant as an illustration of how the Cram & Ferguson architects adapted Late Gothic Revival styling to the design of a small church.

The Aztec social class of the mƒÅcƒìhualtin were rural farmers, forming the majority of the commoners in the Aztec Empire. The mƒÅcƒìhualtin worked lands that belonged to the social unit of the calpolli called chinampas, with each family maintaining rights to the land so long as it did not lie fallow for more than two years. Within these lands, the rural mƒÅcƒìhualtin constructed small dams and terraces to increase their agricultural yield. Crops common to Mexican agriculture were grown on these plots, including maize, beans and squash. These projects were probably organized by the local communities and were not state led. From their produce and productivity, the mƒÅcƒìhualtin were required to pay tribute to the Aztec nobility. During the reign of Moctezuma II (1502‚Äì1520), they were banned from serving in the royal palaces, as this monarch widened the divide between pipiltin (nobles) and macehualtin. However, before his reign it was noted that there was some mobility, though uncommon, within the social classes. Those who moved up and became pipiltin were called yaotequihua. Those who were brought down ranks in spite of birth status as pipiltin were called pillaquistiltin. Macehualtin could also become or sell their children into slavery. This possibility for social mobility was relatively uncommon due to the locative view of the world held by the Aztecs. This point of view emphasized the idea that everyone and everything had a correct place in the world. It was almost a moral imperative to find one's place and conform to its requirements. This logic extended to social class, with the pipiltin being viewed as having trained to rule the rest of society, specifically made by the Aztec gods for this purpose, and the macehualtin being viewed as having been made to work for the benefit of society. Rituals, teachings, and many other aspects of Aztec society helped to reinforce this worldview. Inequality among the social classes was further reinforced by societal institutions such as a differential set of laws for the commoners and those of the upper class. This differential set of laws was harsher towards the nobility than towards the commoners for a comparable offense. As Aztec society was in part centered on warfare, every Aztec male received some sort of basic military training from an early age. Typically by the time the child reached three years of age, the boy would begin to take simple instruction at the hands of his father on the tasks expected of men, no matter what social class they fell into. The only extremely slim possibility of possible upwards social mobility for mƒÅcƒìhualtin was through military achievement. The taking of captives (mƒÅltin , singular mƒÅlli) marked an important transition into status as a full warrior, was the way for soldiers to move up the social ladder, and it continued to be a source of honor throughout a man's tenure as a warrior. Failure to take captives or perform well in battle later in life would be a source of dishonor for the warriors. While this would negatively impact warriors who were mƒÅcƒìhualtin, it would be a worse social blow for members of the nobility, although not as materially damaging. The mƒÅcƒìhualtin children attended the telpochcalli or \\"House of Youths\\" beginning at fifteen years of age. This was a school for both boys and girls, but the girls and boys learned separately. In the telpochcalli, the young men learned martial arts and other aspects of Aztec warfare. They spent a great deal of time engaged in physical labor around the school and around the community in order to build the young men's strength. Some activities such as hauling firewood eventually took the form of a test of physical prowess as larger and larger loads of firewood were given to the young men; such youths would have to face greater burdens when they took to the battlefield. While the young men prepared to become warriors for the Aztec Empire, the young Aztec women attended the cuicalco or \\"House of Song\\", a subdivision of the telpochcalli. Here they learned ritual arts like dance and song. Divisions based on gender prominently affected children among the mƒÅcƒìhualtin. An emphasis on gender divisions began at birth, not just with schooling. Some early rituals differed between newborn boys and newborn girls. For the male children, symbolic actions like giving the umbilical cord to warriors to bury in fields where battles might take place emphasized their role as future warriors. For the female children, symbolic actions like burying the umbilical cord near the hearth emphasized the female role in the home.

It lies between Portpatrick and Stranraer in the Rhins of Galloway, part of the traditional county of Wigtownshire. The parish covers around . History \\"Leswalt\\" is a name of unknown origins. Possible derivations for its name include Welsh llys gwellt, meaning \\"grass court\\", or perhaps Gaelic lios uillt, meaning \\"fort of the glen\\", referring to Lochnaw Castle. In the Middle Ages, the area was probably divided into feudal baronies, each controlled by a Baron of the Court, under the overall control of the Sheriff of Wigtownshire. In ancient times it belonged to the monks of Tongland Abbey. In 1390 Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas, granted lands at Leswalt to his illegitimate son or relative, William Douglas of Leswalt. William Douglas was self-styled \\"Lord of Leswalt\\", and Sheriff of Wigton, but was dismissed by Margaret, Duchess of Touraine, daughter of King Robert III of Scotland and wife of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, as part of a power struggle in south-west Scotland. Under duress he transferred lands at Lochnaw to Andrew Agnew, constable of Lochnaw Castle, receiving Cruggleton Castle in exchange. Andrew Agnew had been made hereditary constable of Lochnaw Castle by William Douglas of Leswalt in 1426. He received several charters from James I of Scotland, including one of 31 January 1431, confirming to him and his heirs the office of heritable constable of Lochnaw, with the whole lands and \\"Barony of Lochnaw\\". In 1451 Andrew Agnew was confirmed as Hereditary Sheriff of Wigtownshire. In 1458 he was paid as sheriff. In 1463 when George Douglas of Leswalt (son of William Douglas of Leswalt and Katherine Maxwell) died, the lands of Leswalt and Cruggleton reverted to the Crown, as a consequence of the forfeiture of all of the properties of the Earl of Douglas in AD1456. They were appropriated by Mary of Guelders, the Queen Mother, widow James II of Scotland, and were subsequently claimed by Gilbert Kennedy (later Lord Kennedy), a half-brother to George Douglas, for his son, John Kennedy. These passed to his son, Alexander Kennedy, who made them over to his brother, David Kennedy, 3rd Lord Kennedy, from whom the Earls of Cassilis are descended. Salt was produced at Salt Pan Bay in Leswalt from 1637.

The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Grace included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219  History  After delivery in 1961, Point Grace was assigned a homeport of Crisfield, Maryland, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Cypress was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single- sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over- under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Grace was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and .

While patrolling the Bo De River in December 1966 Point Grace was hit three times by Viet Cong 57mm recoilless rifle fire; twice in the bow, and once amidships. The two hits in the bow exploded in the crew's head and berthing spaces while the amidships hit entered the engine room and damaged a lube oil tank and electrical wiring but failed to explode. No crew injuries occurred.Larzelere, p 83 She was hit twice with recoilless rifle fire while on patrol near the Long Toan Secret Zone on 17 September 1967 with no injuries to the crew but damage to the deckhouse and crew berthing.Larzelere, p 83 On 1 March 1968 , encountered a trawler off the coast near the mouth of the Bo De River which ignored warnings to stop and be searched.

It became a closed basin in the Late Carboniferous (320 Ma to 300 Ma). The basin has a steep northern edge against the Anti Atlas and more gently sloping southern edge. The basin is filled with up to of sediment from the Cambrian and Carboniferous ageas. These marine formations are overlain by a continental Cretaceous and Pliocene Hamada cover.  Petroleum geology  The basin may have potential for oil and/or gas production, but has been largely unexplored.

Known only from Greece and Hungary when it was first described in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M. alcathoe and any other species. With a forearm length of and body mass of , Myotis alcathoe is a small bat. The fur is usually reddish-brown on the upperparts and brown below, but more grayish in juveniles. The tragus (a projection on the inner side of the ear) is short, as is the ear itself, and the inner side of the ear is pale at the base. The wings are brown and the baculum (penis bone) is short and broad. M. alcathoe has a very high-pitched echolocation call, with a frequency that falls from 120 kHz at the beginning of the call to about 43 kHz at the end. Usually found in old-growth deciduous forest near water, Myotis alcathoe forages high in the canopy and above water and mostly eats flies. The animal roosts in cavities high in trees. Although there are some winter records from caves, it may also spend the winter in tree cavities. Several parasites have been recorded on M. alcathoe. The IUCN Red List assesses Myotis alcathoe as \\"data deficient\\", but it is considered threatened in several areas because of its rarity and vulnerability to habitat loss.  Taxonomy  The whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and similar species in Eurasia (collectively known as \\"whiskered bats\\") are difficult to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) was not recognized as distinct from M. mystacinus until the 1970s.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 362 Small, unusual M. mystacinus-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, but it was not until the advent of genetic studies that these bats could be confirmed as representing a distinct species, named Myotis alcathoe. In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary.von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 217; Voigt et al., 2009 Although it also differs from other whiskered bats by morphological characters, Myotis alcathoe is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including DNA sequences and the location of the nucleolus organizer regions.von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218 Two studies used microsatellite markers on European whiskered bats: the first one used western European samples and recovered three well-defined species clusters for M. alcathoe, M. brandtii and M. mystacinus;Jan et al., 2010 the other one, conducted in Poland, suggesting a high level of hybridization with other whiskered bats that would further complicate attempts to identify M. alcathoe morphologically. Von Helversen and Heller argued that none of the old names now considered synonyms of M. mystacinus could apply to M. alcathoe, because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe. However, the more recent discovery of M. alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered.Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 648; Benda et al., 2003a, p. 364 In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a subspecies of M. mystacinus from the Caucasus) may prove to be applicable to M. alcathoe; in that case, the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus. The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual- looking whiskered bats as being abnormal M. mystacinus or M. brandtii. On the basis of mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis, Myotis alcathoe first appeared close to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus) of southern Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia.von Helversen et al., 2001, fig. 2; Mayer et al., 2007, fig. 1 However, a study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene incorporating many Myotis species did not support this relationship, and could not place M. alcathoe securely at a specific position among Eurasian Myotis.Stadelmann et al., 2004, pp. 187‚Äì188 Two groups with slightly divergent mitochondrial DNA sequences (separated by 1.3 to 1.4% sequence divergence) are distinguishable within the species, which probably correspond to different glacial refugia where M. alcathoe populations survived the last glacial period. One, known as the \\"Hungarian\\" group, has been recorded from Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, and probably corresponds to a refugium in Iberia; the other, the \\"Greek\\" group, is known only from Greece and Slovakia.Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 7 The specific name, alcathoe, refers to Alcathoe, a figure from Greek mythology who was turned into a bat when she refused the advances of the god Dionysus. She was associated with gorges and small streams, the preferred habitat of Myotis alcathoe in Greece.von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 217 In their original description, von Helversen and colleagues described her as a nymph, and the common name \\"nymph bat\\" has therefore been used for this species.Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 71; Benda, 2008, p. 107 However, none of the classical sources speak of Alcathoe as a nymph; instead, she was a princess, the daughter of King Minyas of Orchomenos. Therefore, Petr Benda recommended in 2008 that the common name \\"Alcathoe bat\\" or \\"Alcathoe myotis\\" be used instead.Benda, 2008, p. 107 Other common names include \\"Alcathoe's bat\\"Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 71 and \\"Alcathoe whiskered bat\\".  Description  The whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) is very similar to Myotis alcathoe. Myotis alcathoe is the smallest European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray- brown.von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218; Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 42; Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, pp. 53‚Äì54 The brown fur distinguishes adult M. alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified on the basis of morphology.Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 9 M. alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M. emarginatus in color.Benda et al., 2003a, p. 362 On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8 mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base. The face and the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in M. mystacinus.Pavliniƒá et al., 2012, p. 331; Bogdanowicz et al., 2012, table 1 Although most of the face is hairy, the area around the eyes is bare. The nostrils are heart-shaped,Dietz and von Helversen, 2004, p. 42 and their back end is broad, as in M. brandtii, not narrow as in M. mystacinus.von Helversen, 2001, p. 1161 Several glands are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch at the edge of the ear, and the pointed tragus (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both M. brandtii and M. mystacinus.Bogdanowicz et al., 2012, table 1 The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in M. mystacinus.Alcalde, 2010, p. 232; Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, p. 54; Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 647 The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes M. alcathoe from the slightly larger M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, but the feet are relatively larger than in M. mystacinus.Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 647 The wings are brown, but lighter than those of M. mystacinus.von Helversen, 2004, p. 1162 The plagiopatagium (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is attached to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1 mm beyond the back margin of the uropatagium (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The calcar, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3 mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen).Pavliniƒá et al., 2012, p. 333 The baculum (penis bone) is about 0.5 mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes M. alcathoe from M. brandtii as well as M. ikonnikovi.von Helversen, 2004, p. 1161; von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 218 Skull of a specimen caught in Slovakia, redrawn from Benda et al. (2003a) The skull is similar in shape to that of M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less well-developed than in M. mystacinus. There is a clear cusp present on the side of the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M. mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M. brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4. As usual in Myotis species, M. alcathoe has a karyotype consisting of 44 chromosomes, with the fundamental number of chromosomal arms equal to 52. However, a 1987 study already found that M. alcathoe (then called \\"Myotis sp. B\\") differs from both M. mystacinus and M. brandtii in the pattern of active nucleolus organizer regions on the chromosomes. M. alcathoe also differs from other Myotis species in the sequences of the mitochondrial genes 12S rRNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 by at least 5% and 13%, respectively.von Helversen et al., 2001, pp. 219‚Äì220 M. alcathoe has the highest-frequency echolocation call of any European Myotis. In open terrain, the call has an average duration of 2.5 ms, but it may be up to 4 ms long. At the beginning, its frequency is around 120 kHz, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53 kHz.von Helversen et al., 2001, pp. 221‚Äì222 It terminates at around 43 to 46 kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive.Dietz et al., 2007, p. 231 In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66 ms, respectively.von Helversen, 2004, p. 1167 The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, p. 109 Head and body length is about and wingspan is around .von Helversen, pers. comm. in Skiba, 2003, p. 107 Forearm length is , tibia length is , hindfoot length is , and body mass is .Dietz et al., 2007, p. 230  Distribution and habitat  A hunting ground of M. alcathoe in Dardagny, Switzerland A Swiss Alcathoe bat Although Myotis alcathoe was initially known only from Greece and Hungary and was thought to be restricted to southeast Europe, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365; Jan et al., 2010; Ahl√©n, 2010 In several European countries, focused searches were conducted to detect its occurrence.Ohlendorf and Hoffmann, 2009, p. 112; Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 62 Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in alluvial forest (forest near a river), where there are many decaying trees that the bat can use as roosting sites.Bashta et al., 2011, p. 2 In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed deciduous forest. In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the greater and lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros) and Myotis emarginatus.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365 It may yet be found in other European countries, such as the Benelux countries, Ireland, and Moldova.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 365; Dietz et al., 2007, pp. 231, 233; Jan et al., 2010, p. 471 Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 11 Known records are as follows: ;Albania: A single specimen was caught in 2006 in a forest of planes (Platanus orientalis) and poplars (Populus spp.) next to a small stream. M. mystacinus was recorded at the same place.Niermann et al., 2007, pp. 362‚Äì363 ;Austria: Three specimens of M. alcathoe were recorded in Burgenland, southeastern Austria, in 2006.Spitzenberger et al., 2008, p. 3 They were caught near fishponds in a region dominated by oak (Quercus petraea) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus).Spitzenberger et al., 2008, pp. 4‚Äì6 ;Azerbaijan: The species was recorded around 2009.Rakhmatulina, 2010, p. 1 ;Belgium: The species is known from the 31 of July 2011 in two places around the city of Rochefort.Wallonia, August 9, 2011: D√©couverte d'une nouvelle esp√®ce de chauve-souris en Belgique : le vespertilion d'Alcathoe Myotis alcathoe ;Bulgaria: The species is known from six localities in the south and west of the country; the first record dates from 2003.Schunger et al., 2004, p. 325 Habitats include river and mountain forests.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 363 ;Croatia: In 2003, M. alcathoe was recorded here on the basis of two specimens;Croatian Natural History Museum, 2005, p. 2 three additional specimens were found in 2004.Pavliniƒá et al., 2012, p. 331 ;Czech Republic: Here, the species was recorded at nine sites clustered in three regions, with the first record dating from 2001,Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 64 in addition to records from roadkilled specimens at three further sites.≈òeh√°k et al., 2008 The typical habitat was mature oak-hornbeam forest near water with dead, decaying trees, at altitudes ranging from .Luƒçan et al., 2009, table 1; ≈òeh√°k et al., 2008, pp. 465‚Äì466 Both M. mystacinus and M. brandtii occur in some of the same places in this country.Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 69 M. alcathoe has a limited, patchy distribution within the country, but reaches a high abundance in suitable habitat. ;France: M. alcathoe was informally recognized in France in 2000 as a small Myotis similar to M. mystacinus, the \\"Murin cantalou\\"; in 2002, it was realized that this bat represents M. alcathoe.Ruedi et al., 2002, p. 645 A large number of sites are known, mostly in the north of the country. The species reaches altitudes of up to . It is usually found close to water, but it has been found in a variety of habitats, including farmlands, swamps, forests, and wooden grounds. In late summer and autumn, it occurs in caves. ;Germany: The species is known from two different areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site.Brinkmann and Niermann, 2007, p. 197 The species is also known from the Kyffh√§user hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated deciduous forest.Sauerbier et al., 2006; Niermann et al., 2007, p. 364; Schorcht et al., 2009 The species was also recorded in deciduous forest at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia.Pr√ºger and Bergner, 2008, p. 115 M. alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed deciduous forest. Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water.Ohlendorf et al., 2008; Ohlendorf, 2009a, pp. 45‚Äì46 However, the species was also recorded in the center of the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.Ohlendorf et al., 2008, p. 115 ;Greece: The species has been recorded in the Pindus and Rhodopi Mountains of central and northern Greece. Here, M. alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat and with M. mystacinus.von Helversen et al., 2001, p. 221 ;Hungary: M. alcathoe is not uncommon in the mountain forests of northeastern Hungary. It has been found at brooks and lakes in oak, beech, alder, and hornbeam (Carpinetum) forests at altitude. Both M. brandtii and M. mystacinus occur together with M. alcathoe there.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 364 ;Italy: M. alcathoe has been recorded in beech forest in Majella National Park in the region of Abruzzo.Parco Nazionale della Majella, 2008 Additional specimens of M. alcathoe have been identified in Italy using molecular methods.Galimberti et al., 2010 In December 2013 its presence has been confirmed in the protected area of Appennino Lucano National Park (Basilicata).ANSA NewsAppennino Lucano National Park news De Pasquale, P. P., Galimberti, A. 2014 ;Latvia: A small Myotis was captured at a cave in Latvia between 2007 and 2010; pending genetic testing, it is suspected to be M. alcathoe.Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Latvia, 2010 However, this record had not been confirmed in the subsequent national report to EUROBATS in 2014. ;Luxembourg: A single male was caught in 2011 and confirmed as M. alcathoe on the basis of genetic data. Elsewhere in the country it has been recorded on the basis of acoustic data.Gessner, 2012, p. 138 ;Poland: The species was recorded in four caves in southern Poland in 2005 and 2006, and later at several other sites in the south of the country. It is known from above sea level, most often in beech forest (Fagus sylvatica), but also in several other forest types.Niermann et al., 2007, p. 364; Bashta et al., 2011, table 1 ;Romania: A single M. alcathoe was captured in 2007 in a nature reserve in the eastern Carpathians; the reserve contains riverine and conifer forest.J√©re and D√≥czy, 2007, p. 179 The species was additionally recorded in a forested valley containing a small stream in Alba County.Ohlendorf and Hoffmann, 2009, p. 112 ;Russian part of Caucasus: Bats collected in the Russian part of the Caucasus and in Abkhazia (a breakaway part of Georgia) from 2003 to 2009Gazaryan, 2009, p. 51 may represent M. alcathoe. They are small and morphometrically distinct from other local Myotis mystacinus-like bats.Gazaryan, 2009, p. 60 The affinity of these bats to M. alcathoe has recently been confirmed by the genetic and morphological analyses.Benda et al. 2016 ;Serbia: The species was reported on the basis of three specimens shortly before 2009, but is probably rare.Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning, Republic of Serbia, 2010, p. 4 ;Slovakia: Here, M. alcathoe is known from a single site, a cave in old deciduous forest at altitude.Benda et al., 2003a, pp. 360‚Äì361 ;Slovenia: A single specimen was recorded in Slovenia in 2007, although it is not clear how many bats previously recorded as Myotis mystacinus belong to this species.Presetnik et al., 2007, p. 99 Several additional specimens were later found in Koƒçevski Rog (SE Slovenia).Presetnik, 2012 ;Spain: In Catalonia, the species is known from six sites,Flaquer et al., 2010, table 1 ranging from sea level to altitude. It is known in beech and riverine forest and was first recorded in 2006.Flaquer et al., 2010, p. 41 The species is known from three sites in La Rioja, where it was recorded in 2004, and occurs amidst beech and riverine forest at altitude.Agirre-Mendi et al., 2004, p. 54 It has also been found at seven localities in Navarre, with the first record dating from 2004. There, it occurs in beech and oak forest at altitudes from .Alcalde, 2010, pp. 227‚Äì229 In Galicia, it is known from three localities at above sea level.Hermida et al., 2012, p. 15 ;Sweden: The species was recorded at five sites in the south of the country, starting in 2008, on the basis of echolocation calls.Ahl√©n, 2010 ;Switzerland: M. alcathoe has been recorded from the Col du Marchairuz in the Jura Mountains (canton of Vaud).Stadelmann et al., 2004, table 1, p. 187; von Helversen, 2004, p. 1164 The species is acoustically detected in 2003 in the canton of Geneva, and subsequent captures led to the discovery of the first breeding sites for the country. ;Turkey: Eight individuals have been caught at three sites in close vicinity in the European part of the country in 2006.Niermann et al., 2007, pp. 371‚Äì372 ;Ukraine: In 2009, the possible occurrence of M. alcathoe in Ukraine was recorded.Zagorodnyuk and Dykyy, 2009 In 2011, the species was definitively recorded there on the basis of two bats caught in the far southwest of the country in 2009.Bashta et al., 2011, p. 2, table 1 ;United Kingdom: M. alcathoe has been recorded in England since 2003, and is known from two swarming sites in the south and a third site in the north of the country.Jan et al., 2010, p. 471 The northern England site, in Ryedale, is in a protected area with many old trees, and the southern sites (in Sussex) are in woodland.Jan et al., 2010, p. 476 The species is also known from Montenegro and possibly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Early records of Myotis ikonnikovi‚Äînow known to be an eastern Asian species‚Äîfrom Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania may also pertain to this species. Because whiskered bats in many cases cannot easily be distinguished from each other without the use of genetic methods, some listings do not differentiate between them; records of M. alcathoe and/or M. mystacinus and/or (in some cases) M. brandtii have been reported from Bulgaria,Benda et al., 2003b, pp. 288‚Äì290 Belgium,Kervyn et al., 2009 and Montenegro.Benda, 2004, p. 14  Ecology and behavior  Myotis alcathoe is a rare species with narrow ecological requirements.Brinkmann and Niermann, 2007, p. 199 According to a study in the Czech Republic, the diet of Myotis alcathoe mostly consists of nematoceran flies, but caddisflies, spiders, small lepidopterans, and neuropterans are also taken.Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 66 The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water,Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 68 and is often found in dense vegetation.von Helversen, 2004, p. 1164 The parasitic mite Spinturnix mystacina has been found on M. alcathoe, and the mites on M. alcathoe, M. brandtii, and M. mystacinus are genetically closely related.Bruyndonckx et al., 2009, table 1, fig. 2 The bat fly Basilia mongolensis nudior has been recorded on M. alcathoe in ThuringiaHeddergott, 2009 and the tick Ixodes vespertilionis in Romania.Mihalca et al., 2012, table 1 When caught, individuals of M. alcathoe are much calmer than M. mystacinus or M. brandtii.Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, pp. 109‚Äì110 M. alcathoe lives in small groups.Ohlendorf, 2009a, p. 46 In Greece, a maternity colony, containing three females and two juveniles, has been found in a plane tree. Additional roosts were found high in oak trees in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Saxony-Anhalt.Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, p. 112 Twenty- seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks (Quercus robur); others were in limes (Tilia cordata), birches (Betula pendula), and various other species.Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 65 Its strong preference for roosting sites in trees is unusual among European bats.Bashta et al., 2011, p. 4 Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy, and are often in old trees.Brinkmann and Niermann, 2007, p. 206 In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups.Luƒçan et al., 2009, p. 67 M. alcathoe swarms from late July to mid-September in southern Poland.Bogdanowicz et al., 2012, p. 7 In Saxony-Anhalt, the species forages deep in valleys when temperatures are above , but on warmer slopes or rocky areas when it is colder. There, M. alcathoe is relatively easy to capture in August, because M. brandtii and M. mystacinus already start swarming in late July.Ohlendorf and Hoffmann, 2009, p. 112; Ohlendorf, 2009b, p. 149 Although there are some records of M. alcathoe in caves during the winter, it is also possible that animals spend the winter in tree cavities, and whether swarming behavior occurs in M. alcathoe is unclear.Ohlendorf, 2009b, pp. 154, 156; Dietz et al., 2007, p. 233 An animal found in a cave in Saxony-Anhalt in January was not sleeping deeply.Ohlendorf, 2009b, p. 149 Reproduction may also take place in caves, but pregnant females have been found as late as June.Dietz et al., 2007, p. 234 Relatively many juveniles are caught between July and September.Ohlendorf and Funkel, 2008, p. 111 In England, one individual of M. alcathoe was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as M. brandtii) and again in 2009.Jan et al., 2010, p. 473 Three individuals that were telemetrically tracked (in eastern France, Thuringia, and Baden-W√ºrttemberg, respectively) moved only , , and from their night quarters; M. brandtii and M. mystacinus tend to move over longer distances.Schorcht et al., 2009, p. 126 A study in Poland suggested frequent hybridization among M. alcathoe, M. brandtii, and M. mystacinus sharing the same swarming sites, probably attributable to male-biased sex ratios (1.7:1 in M. alcathoe), a polygynous mating system, and the high number of bats at swarming sites.Bogdanowicz et al., 2012, p. 8 M. alcathoe showed a particularly high proportion of hybrids, perhaps because it occurs at lower densities than the other two species.  Conservation status  Because Myotis alcathoe remains poorly known, it is assessed as \\"Data Deficient\\" on the IUCN Red List. However, it may be endangered because of its narrow ecological preferences. Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites where it has been recorded have already been destroyed. Forest loss is another possible threat, and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats.Dietz et al., 2007, p. 233 Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats. The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal. In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.Dietz et al., 2007, p. 235 In Catalonia, the species is listed as \\"Endangered\\" in view of its apparent rarity there.Flaquer et al., 2010, p. 42 The Red List of Germany's Endangered Vertebrates lists M. alcathoe as \\"Critically Endangered\\" as of 2009.Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2010, p. 8 In the Genevan region, the species is also listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" as of 2015. In Hungary, where the species is probably not uncommon in suitable habitat,Ministry of Rural Development, 2010, p. 4 it has been protected since 2005.Ministry of Rural Development, 2010, p. 5 However, the species is declining there and is threatened by habitat loss and disturbance of caves.Ministry of Rural Development, 2010, p. 1  References   Literature cited  *Agirre-Mendi, P.T., Garc√≠a-Mudarra, J.L., Juste, J. and Ib√°√±ez, C. 2004.

Records of his journey note him walking from Sydney to Melbourne, and collections at Twofold Bay, the Huon Valley and mountains in Tasmania, and other regions in the 1850s and 60s. The large body of material in the west of the country was collected from King George Sound to the Murchison River, and he travelled across the Nullarbor to Adelaide. Oldfield published a paper 'On the Aborigines of Australia' in 1865,Transactions of the Ethnological Society of London, n.s., vol. 3, 1865. a detailed survey of the cultural practices of the peoples living near Port Gregory. He died on 22 May 1887, after returning to London in 1862. His main collection was deposited at Melbourne by Ferdinand von Mueller, other parts of his herbaria are held at Kew and Western Australia. Joseph Dalton Hooker notes his contribution in Flora Tasmaniae as \\"a zealous collector and as a careful and acute observer\\".

Luuka, where the district headquarters are located is approximately , by road, northwest of Iganga, the nearest large town. The coordinates of the district are:00 42N, 33 18E. Overview Luuka District was created by Act of Parliament and became functional on 1 July 2010. Prior to then, the district was Luuka County in Iganga District. In Kisoga tradition, Luuka is one of the five traditional principalities of the Kingdom of Busoga. According to legend, Luuka was founded around 1737 A.D. and became a part of the British protectorate in Busoga in 1896 A.D. Its traditional ruler is known as the Tabingwa. The district is made up of the following sub-counties: (a) Bukanga (b) Bukooma (c) Bulongo (d) Ikumbya (e) Irongo (f) Nawampiti and (g) Waibuga. Population In 1991, the national population census estimated the district population at about 130,400. The national census in 2002 estimated the district population to be approximately 185,500.

Structurally MDL-1 is a type II transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail and without signaling motifs, therefore it requires association with the adaptor protein DAP12 to generate signals via Syk pathway. MDL-1 is highly expressed on myeloid lineages like neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage and also osteoclast, microglia and dendritic cells. Activation of MDL-1 induces production of many cytokines (TNF-Œ±, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17A) and chemokines (MIP-1Œ±, RANTES, IP-10, MDC). MDL-1 also amplifies innate immune response. Viral pathology The most known ligand for CLEC5A is dengue virus (DV). Activated CLEC5A by binding to the dengue virion leads to phosphorylation of DAP12 and through Syk pathway are induced proinflammatory cytokines. CLEC5A is responsible for dengue virus induced hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which is the most severe immune response to dengue virus infection and it is characterized by plasma leakage because of the increased vascular permeability. Interaction of CLEC5A and dengue virus also induces osteolytic activity. Another pathogen is influenza virus and its hemagglutinin protein, which interacts with CLEC5A. Through this interaction is stimulated innate immune response and it leads to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The researchers discovered that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) also binds to CLEC5A and contributes to viral pathology. Use in therapy With the discovery of CLEC5A interactions with different viruses, scientists are testing blocking anti-CLEC5A antibodies, Syk pathway inhibitors and CLEC5A deficient mice to discover CLEC5A contribution to pathological progress. In the case of dengue virus, monoclonal anti-CLEC5A antibodies are able to suppress the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting IFN-Œ±. Blockade of CLEC5A signaling in DV infected cells can attenuate vascular leakage and increase survival of patients with DHF and DSS. In lethal challenges of recombinant H5N1 influenza virus, the CLEC5A deficient mice showed reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased immune cell infiltration in the lungs and improved survival compared to the wild-type mice even with comparable viral loads. For the Japanese encephalitis virus, blockade of CLEC5A cannot inhibit infection of neurons and astrocytes, however anti-CLEC5A decreases proinflammatory cytokines and toxic substances released from microglia.

It is marketed as a way to encourage passengers to take a taxicab rather than driving while intoxicated or with a driver who is intoxicated, especially on New Year's Eve. The system was initially conceptualized by M. Carol Rancourt and was then introduced in 2010 by three men, fathers of three teenagers who were seriously injured in a car crash caused by a drunken driver, and received the support of Sam Hamad, Quebec's minister of transportation. The coupons can only be used for taxi fares and cannot be exchanged for cash, except that a driver will give change when the value of the coupons tendered by a passenger is more than the fare. The coupons are in denominations of $5 and $10, and incorporate some anti- counterfeiting techniques which are also used in cheques and banknotes. The plan is operated by Comit√© provincial de concertation et de d√©veloppement de l'industrie du taxi, a trade association for the taxi industry in Quebec. Coupons can be purchased from the offices of taxi companies, Couche-Tard convenience stores and Familiprix pharmacies. In June 2014, about 80 high school students in La Tuque, Quebec, each received 10-dollar Cool Taxi coupons provided by the city of La Tuque and the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec provincial police so that the students could get home safely after their graduation dance.

Introduction Anthony Adrian Allen, almost universally known as A.A. Allen, was an entomologist specialising in the beetles (Coleoptera) of the British Isles. He has been described as 'one of the best known British coleopterists'.Barclay, M.V.L. (& Editorial Panel) 2010. A.A. Allen. The Coleopterist 19(3); p.150. He was a pupil and friend of several prominent late 19th-early 20th century entomologists, including Horace Donisthorpe and Phillip Harwood.  Faunistic work Allen is perhaps best known for his work on the British beetle fauna, which includes more than 4,000 species.Duff, A.G. (ed.) Checklist of Beetles of the British Isles, 2008 edition. http://www.coleopterist.org.uk/checklist2008%20A5.pdf During his career he published hundreds of papers and scientific notes on the subject, mostly in the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. He had a subsidiary interest in the British fauna of flies Diptera and true bugs Hemiptera, on which he also published.  Taxonomic work Allen was one of the few 20th century British faunists to describe new species to science from the British Isles. Over a 62 year period Allen described 13 new species of beetle, of which four remain valid. The apparently high rate of synonymy of his species results from the fact he was primarily dealing with taxonomically difficult groups of beetles. The four valid species described by Allen are: Staphylinidae: Aleochara phycophila Allen 1937 Acrotona benicki (Allen 1940) Scraptiidae: Scraptia testacea Allen 1940 Chrysomelidae: Longitarsus fowleri Allen 1967 As may be expected for species that remained undiscovered until the mid 20th century, all four valid species described by A.A. Allen are uncommon, and are given conservation status.Hyman, P S revised and updated by Parsons, M S.

The British species of the genus Aleochara Gravenhorst (Staphylinidae). The Coleopterist 6 (1): 1-45 Longitarsus fowleri is named in honour of Coleopterist William Weekes Fowler.  Honorifics Allen received the rare accolade of having two British beetle species named by colleagues in his honour, the ground-living weevil Trachyphloeus alleni Donisthorpe, 1948 and the latridiid plaster beetle Corticaria alleni Johnson, 1974. However, the former, named by the myrmecologist and coleopterist Horace Donisthorpe, was later placed in synonymy with the widespread Trachyphloeus asperatus Boheman, 1843.  Collection A.A. Allen's almost comprehensive collection of British Beetles, including most of his type specimens, was presented to the Natural History Museum, London in October 2010. The Museum intends to digitally scan the 38 drawers, and make them available as high resolution images on the internet \\"as a scientific resource, and as a permanent record of A.A.

This statue serves as a memorial to Saint Mother Th√©odore Gu√©rin and was a gift from the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. Description The statue is a full body portrait of the Saint standing at 6 feet tall. It is made of Indiana limestone and shows her wearing a traditional Catholic nun‚Äôs habit. A rosary hangs from her waist and she stares straight ahead. Her proper left arm is pulled to her chest holding the cross that hangs from her neck. Her proper right arm is outstretched in front of her with her hand open as if reaching out to hold someone's hand. Her proper right foot steps out in front her. The statue stands on top of a limestone base which stands on a granite base and is surrounded by flowers. Artist Teresa Clark moved from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Terre Haute, Indiana, in the spring of 2005 and shortly thereafter she was commissioned to create the statue of the Saint. As a non-religious person she was moved by the story of the Saint Mother and in 2006 she was baptized Catholic at the age of 50. The sculpture was carved by master stone carver Nick Fairplay from Oberlin, Ohio. Information Clark credits the commission as clearing problems up in her life, hence her conversion to Catholicism. Creating the sculpture from clay Clark described the process of creation in relation to the Saint: \\"Using your hands to create someone, an individual who was a woman of faith‚Äîone kind of feeds the other. I almost feel her presence at times when I‚Äôm working.\\" The plans to create the sculpture had been in the works since 2004. It took Clark over a year to carve the piece, finalizing it in early 2006. After approval from the National Shrine, a fiberglass molding was produced and the sculpture was sent to Fairplay's studio. The limestone came from Victor Oolitic Stone Company in Oolitic, Indiana, and was delayed in being delivered to Fairplay's studio. Acquisition The Sculpture, a gift of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, was installed in Mary's Garden at the National Shrine, on the grounds of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculat Conception in Washington, D.C., and dedicated on May 10, 2008. More than 450 people attended the ceremony which included Clark. After a liturgy was held at the Crypt Church at the Shrine, Archbishop Pietro Sambi blessed the sculpture. A reception was held at the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center. The sculpture was described as a \\"wonderful addition\\" to the garden by Reverend Monsignor Walter R. Rossi.

The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web at least at some point in the transaction's lifecycle, although it can encompass a wider range of technologies such as e-mail as well. A large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely electronically for virtual items such as access to premium content on a website, but most electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as e-tailers and online retail is sometimes known as e-tail. Almost all big retailers have electronic commerce presence on the World Wide Web. Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses is referred to as business-to-business or B2B. B2B can be open to all interested parties (e.g. commodity market) or limited to specific, pre-qualified participants (private electronic market). Electronic commerce that is conducted between businesses and consumers, on the other hand, is referred to as business-to-consumer or B2C. This is the type of electronic commerce conducted by companies such as Amazon.com. Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce where the buyer is connected directly online to the seller's computer usually via the Internet. There is no specific intermediary service. The sale and purchase transaction is completed electronically and interactively in real-time, such as when buying a new book on Amazon.com. If an intermediary is present, then the sale and purchase transaction is called consumer-to-consumer, such as an online auction conducted on eBay.com. This payment system has been widely accepted by consumers and merchants throughout the world, and is by far the most popular method of payments especially in the retail markets. Some of the most important advantages over the traditional modes of payment are: privacy, integrity, compatibility, good transaction efficiency, acceptability, convenience, mobility, low financial risk and anonymity.

OutServe-SLDN was one of the largest LGBT employee resource groups in the world. OutServe was founded by a 2009 graduate of the US Air Force Academy, Josh Seefried (also known as JD Smith to protect his identity) and Ty Walrod. There were over 7,000 members and 80 chapters worldwide. In May 2019, OutServe-SLDN merged with the American Military Partner Association (AMPA) to form the Modern Military Association of America (MMAA), a united voice for the LGBTQ military and veteran community. MMAA continues the missions of both OutServe-SLDN and AMPA through education, advocacy, and support for LGBTQ service members, veterans, military spouses, family members and allies. On July 2, 2012, OutServe announced that it would merge with Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization that advocates on behalf of and provides legal services to gay and lesbian military personnel and veterans, in October 2012. On October 25, 2012, Allyson Robinson was the first Executive Director of OutServe-SLDN following the merger of those two organizations. She was the first transgender person to ever lead a national LGBT rights organization that does not have an explicit transgender focus. As part of an extensive reorganization and a review of the organization's mission and finances, which included some public airing of internal dissension and inability to fund its current operations, Josh Seefried resigned from the Board on July 8, 2013 Less than nine months after hiring Robinson, OutServe-SLDN's board announced it was bankrupt and had to close its Washington D.C. headquarters; on the same day, Robinson announced that her resignation as executive director would take effect the following day, July 12, 2013. The board announced that for at least a year it plans to focus on the financial crisis and the payment of debts, followed by an eventual return to providing \\"advocacy, development, or other support.\\" Since that time, OutServe-SLDN continued to actively serve its over 7,000 members and in early 2014 engaged with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding Marriage Equality Cases in Oklahoma and Utah.

Logo of OutServe (2012) There are leaders for each of the 80+ chapters worldwide, whose identities, as well as those of all members, were kept anonymous under DADT. With the expiration of DADT on September 20, 2011, JD Smith revealed his true identity. One hundred and one OutServe members in total came out publicly with the end of DADT. Membership OutServe members taking part in Stuttgart's Pride March in 2016 (Germany). As of April 2011, OutServe was divided into 42 regional chapters, with a total membership of over 5,000 members. It included personnel from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard, both commissioned officers and enlisted. Due to privacy concerns, OutServe's Membership was closely guarded and monitored. Each chapter has an internally selected leader. Several chapters have hosted meetings and social gatherings aimed at improving the morale and quality of life of the members. The structure of OutServe was inspired by the British military's Proud2Serve organization. As of 2014, OutServe has continued to grow and now has a total membership of over 7,000 members in 80+ chapters worldwide. General In June 2010, OutServe sent a letter criticizing the Comprehensive Review Working Group's initial decision to exclude gay and lesbian military personnel from the DADT review process. On July 26, 2010, OutServe was falsely accused of claiming to be the first organization to directly represent active-duty service members, specifically. Walrod said that OutServe was not interested in claiming credit for the work of other organizations and only aimed to give a voice to personnel silenced by the DADT policy. At the end of August 2011, the DOD approved the distribution of OutServe Magazine at Army and Air Force base exchanges beginning with the September 20 issue, coinciding with the end of DADT. OutServe Magazine OutServe Magazine, co-founded by Air Force Staff Sgt. Jonathan Mills and Capt Edward Sweeney, was a bi-monthly periodical digital and print publication of OutServe, a non-profit, non-government organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender service members in the United States Armed Forces. It was first published online in March 2011, while OutServe was still operating clandestinely prior to the repeal of the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy that banned open gays from service. The Magazine was later printed and distributed to military bases, the first magazine of its kind to receive DoD approval for distribution, beginning the day of the implementation of DADT repeal. The publication was distributed free of charge to the military, and was available to the public for downloading and redistribution through its website and mobile apps. The Magazine published its final issue in June 2013, one month before the resignation of key OutServe-SLDN leaders. The Magazine's archived issues can be found at MagCloud. SLDN Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) was founded as a non-profit legal services, watchdog, and policy organization founded in the United States in 1993. It was dedicated to ending discrimination and harassment of gay and lesbian U.S. military personnel negatively affected by the \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT) policy which was established that same year. Before being merged into OutServe-SLDN, SLDN documented over 700 violations in the policy's first two years of operation. As of January 2011, it provided legal aid to more than 10,000 service members. =Lawsuits= In June 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled against SLDN in Cook v.

When he was three-months old he and his mother went to British Malaya where his father Visvanathan Murugeysu, who hailed from Vaddukoddai, was Head of the Telegraph Office, an officer in the British colonial administration, in Kuala Lumpur. The Tiruchelvam family were friends of the Chelvanayakam family who were also living in Malaya. Tiruchelvam had three brothers and a sister. Tiruchelvam and his brother Rajendra were sent to British Ceylon to have their education at S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia. S. J. V. Chelvanayakam was the brothers' guardian. Tiruchelvam later studied at Ceylon University College, obtaining an honours degree in History. Tiruchelvam married Punithavathy (Punitham) Canagaratnam. They had four children: Neelan Tiruchelvam, Kamini, Janaki, Vasudevan. Legal career After graduating Tiruchelvam studied law and became a lawyer in 1935 when he started practicing law. He served as the magistrate in Negombo, Panadura and Galle till 1945. He was appointed Assistant to the Legal Secretary to the then Legal Secretary Sir Alan Rose. He assisted Sir Alan in drafting the Soulbury Constitution. Tiruchelvam was appointed Deputy Solicitor-General in 1944. He was appointed Solicitor General of Ceylon in 1957, a position he held until 1960. Tiruchelvam took part in a number of high-profile legal cases.

In 1965, after the signing of the Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact (aka Dudley-Chelvanayakam Pact), ITAK joined the United National Party-led national government. ITAK's MP refused take ministerial portfolios but instead Tiruchelvam was appointed to the Senate of Ceylon and made Minister of Local Government. During Tiruchelvam's ministerial tenure the eventual creation of the University of Jaffna was started, the Tamil Language Special Provisions Act (aka Reasonable Use of Tamil Act) became law in 1966 and administrative reforms carried out. Tiruchelvam resigned from the government in November 1968 when Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake overturned his decision to make Fort Fredrick in Trincomalee a sacred precinct (the fort contained the Koneswaram temple). ITAK then left the national government, blaming the government's failure to implement the Senanayake-Chelvanayakam Pact. Tiruchelvam stayed on in the Senate until it was abolished in 1971.

Design and construction The Tancook Schooner, with its counter stern and characteristic round or 'spoon' bow was a distinctive type of small sailing work boat built primarily on Big Tancook Island, Nova Scotia and the immediate surrounding area on and near Mahone Bay. The design succeeded the earlier double ended Tancook Whaler fishing boats. The Tancook Schooners were usually larger than the Tancook Whalers and had fixed keels rather than centerboards. The sail plan for the smaller sizes of transom sterned schooners was typically gaff rigged fore and main and one or sometimes two headsails. After about 1930, Marconi main sail rigs were common and a number of the smaller schooners were rigged as knockabouts flying a single jib without a bowsprit keeping the head sail rigging on deck. Ray Stevens design Tancook Schooner yacht profile History It has been claimed that Amos Stevens produced Tancook's first counter stern schooner the Black Nance, a 38 footer around 1903.The Tancook Schooners An Island and Its Boats Wayne M. O'Leary McGill-Queen's University Press 1994 p. 50 Within a few years the characteristic 'spoon bow' with its greater buoyancy and fullness compared to the so-called Aberdeen or clipper bow of the Tancook Whaler was standard among the island's four boat building families who collectively produced most of these distinctive schooners for fishing and small scale coastal freighting. Before 1925 the canvas material for the sails was often laid out and cut on the ice of a sheltered area. The firm of Mason and Langille used Southeast Cove Pond.The Tancook Schooners An Island and Its Boats Wayne M. O'Leary McGill-Queen's University Press 1994 p. 105 The individual panels of cloth were then taken to Lunenburg along with a sail plan drawing for sewing in lofts there. After 1910 nearly all the schooners were also equipped with auxiliary gas engines. Tancook schooners as large as 60 or 70 feet sailed offshore to distant fishing grounds as the larger salt bankers did or worked as coastal freight carriers, but many more were built in the 35 to 50 foot range and worked closer to home staying out for shorter periods. Four boat building families, the Stevens, Heislers, Masons, and Langilles were responsible for the majority of the schooners built between 1900 and 1945. Line fishing for various ground fish species and cod and drift net fishing for mackerel and herring were the main fisheries that the schooners were employed in. One of the last trades the island schooners engaged in during the 1930s was transporting winter cabbage and barrels of sauerkraut to the mainland. Many Tancook boats were built for yachtsmen of the Chester region. Mahone Bay was a popular yachting area and the handsome sea kindly schooners made good cruisers when outfitted for pleasure sailing. Working boats were also bought and converted for yachting. The Airlie of the Nova Scotia Schooner Association is one surviving example of a working schooner converted to pleasure. The advent of surfaced roads and trucking finished off the last coastal freight trade for the Tancook boats. The schooners were quickly phased out in favor of the gasoline powered \\"Cape Island\\" boat after 1940. However, Tancook schooners continued to be built for yachtsmen. Two 38-footers designed by David Westergard incorporate some elements of Tancook builders' designs and were under construction at the Dory shop in Lunenburg in 2010.

Among its provisions, the most notable was the mandate requiring positive train control (PTC) technology to be installed on most of the US railroad network by 2015. This was spurred by the 2008 Chatsworth train collision the month prior to passage of the act. In October 2015 Congress extended the deadline to 2018.  Background  Starting in 1990 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) counted PTC among its \\"Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements.\\"National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Washington, DC (2010). \\"Modifications to NTSB Most Wanted List; List of Transportation Safety Improvements after September 1990.\\"NTSB (2010). \\"NTSB Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements ‚Äì Implement Positive Train Control Systems.\\" At the time, the vast majority of rail lines relied on the human crew for complying with all safety rules, and a significant fraction of accidents were attributable to human error. In September 2008, Congress considered a new rail safety law that set a deadline of 2015 for implementation of PTC technology across most of the U.S. rail network. The bill, ushered through the legislative process by the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, was developed in response to the collision of a Metrolink passenger train and a Union Pacific freight train September 12, 2008, in California, which resulted in the deaths of 25 and injuries to more than 135 passengers. As the bill neared final passage by Congress, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) issued a statement in support of the bill.Association of American Railroads, Washington, DC (2008-09-24). \\"Statement by Edward R. Hamberger, President and CEO Association of American Railroads on Passage of the Comprehensive Rail Safety Bill.\\" Press release. President George W.

Provisions of the law  Among its provisions, the law provides funding to help pay for the development of PTC technology, limits the number of hours freight rail crews can work each month, and requires the Department of Transportation to determine work hour limits for passenger train crews.  Implementation  To implement the law, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) published final regulations for PTC systems on January 15, 2010.Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Washington, DC (2010-01-15). \\"Positive Train Control Systems; Final rule.\\" Federal Register. In December 2010 the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that Amtrak and the major Class I railroads have taken steps to install PTC systems under the law, but the work may not be complete by the 2015 deadline. The railroads and their suppliers are continuing to develop software to test various system components, which could delay equipment installation. GAO also suggests that publicly funded commuter railroads will have difficulty in obtaining funds to pay for their system components.U.S. Government Accountability Office, Washington, DC (December 2010). \\"Federal Railroad Administration Should Report on Risks to the Successful Implementation of Mandated Safety Technology.\\" Report No. GAO-11-133.

The pass can either be caught in the end zone itself, resulting in an immediate touchdown, or in the field of play, followed by the receiver carrying the ball into the endzone himself for the score. Either way, the quarterback is credited in his statistics with the touchdown pass. The term \\"touchdown pass\\" is mostly used for statistical purposes for the quarterback. The statistic is considered to be highly prestigious among quarterbacks, and is one of the four factors in determining the passer rating. In the game, the effect is simply the scoring of a touchdown (6 points). When a touchdown is achieved by running, the quarterback is not credited with a touchdown pass.

It was the worst episode of racial inspired violence that the city faced in some thirty years. \\"Airport Homes\\" was the name of the site in nearby West Lawn established by the Chicago Housing Authority to provide temporary housing to returning veterans and their families during the postwar housing shortage. Residents of West Lawn and West Elsdon rioted and succeeded in intimidating a few black war veterans and their families from joining white veterans in the homes. The upheaval against blacks happened during the working hours while the white men were at work, which meant that the elderly and the women were the ones who started the riot. The West Elsdon Civic Association became one of the first vocal political enemies of the CHA and its first executive secretary, Elizabeth Wood. Opposition to public housing remained strong in the area. In the early 1970s the West Elsdon Civic Association was an active participant in the \\"No-CHA\\" citywide coalition opposing scattered-site public housing in predominantly middle-class white neighborhoods. Chicago's major newspapers published very few details about the riots at the recommendation of the city's Commission on Human Relations (CHR), who feared that excessive coverage would make the riots worse. As a result, there is very little information available on the riots. In total, the CHR recorded 357 serious incidents related to blacks moving into white Chicago neighborhoods between 1945 and 1950.

Area residents viewed this as one of several attempts by the CHA to initiate racial integration into white communities. The riot took place between 98th and 111th streets and lasted for three days, from the day veterans and their families moved into the project, August 13th, 1947 to August 16th, 1947. The Chicago Police Department did little to stop the rioting, as was the case a year before at the Airport Homes race riots. It was one of the worst race riots in Chicago history.  Subsidized housing and racialized neighborhoods  = During World War II = Housing projects in Chicago emerged during the 1940s with the sole purpose of resolving the shortage of affordable homes for war-industry workers, many who were African American, as America prepared for World War II. As Chicago proved to be a crucial steel production center for the war effort, hundreds of thousands of black workers and their families migrated from the South to Chicago in the second wave of the Great Migration. Historian Devereux Bowly iterates some alarming statistics about public housing in Chicago that arose from 1940 census data: 1) 55,157 housing units were overcrowded (exceeding 1.5 persons per room), and 2) 206,103 housing units either had no access to a private bathroom or needed major repairs to interior structures. To answer to such dismal conditions, the CHA opened four housing projects in low income areas with high concentrations of war-industry workers: the Frances Cabrini Homes in August of 1942, the Lawndale Gardens in December of 1942, the Bridgeport Homes in May of 1943, and the Robert H. Brooks Homes in March of 1943. For families to live in these new projects, they needed to have at least one child; the family had to have one member working in a critical war industry (like steel); the family income had to total less than $2,000; and it was preferred that the family's nationality was American. Additional housing projects for war workers led by the National Housing Agency and the Federal Public Housing Authority on the far South Side included the Altgeld Gardens project, which was constructed on a 157-acre vacant land tract in November of 1943. Unlike the above projects, Altgeld Gardens contained row houses and backyards rather than crowded multi-story apartments. Similarly, the West Chesterfield project homes were commissioned by the CHA and built in December of 1943. A unique project, the housing units (actual homes) are built on full city lots, and following construction, the CHA required a minimum annual income as to promote eventual homeownership for residents. While each of the projects identified presented reasonable options for war workers and their families, the end of the war would present different challenges, especially along the lines of integration. = After World War II = As African American soldiers returned from the battlefronts of Europe and the Pacific following the war, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) shifted the initiative from creating housing for war workers and their families to providing temporary housing for returning veterans and their families. The shift occurred in part because of the Emergency Veterans' Re-Use Housing Program, a federal law passed by Congress in 1945 that attempted to resolve the nationwide housing shortage for returning veterans. Elizabeth Wood, the executive director of the CHA, planned to integrate the temporary veterans' housing projects, as she had \\"absorbed [the] spirit\\" of both the values of United States in its efforts to combat fascism and authoritarianism abroad during World War II, and also the energy and hope of black veterans who sought to \\"challenge the country to live up to its wartime rhetoric about freedom.\\" Although the goal of integration contrasted the visions of the Democratic City Council and Illinois governor Dwight Green, Chicago's mayor, Edward Kelly, was a proponent of CHA's vision for integrated veterans' housing and nondiscrimination policy. Chicago's temporary projects were to be constructed in the fall of 1946 and set to close in July of 1949. The first of these projects opened peacefully on the isolated North Side. However, the CHA's second project, the Midway Airport Homes, resulted in mass discontent and violence prior to and after black families moved in. Midway's fearful white working-class community reacted violently to the thought of black families entering the segregated neighborhood. Midway's white population overwhelmingly believed the space should be reserved for deserving white veterans. When the first black family moved into the completed project on November 16, 1946, a white stone-throwing mob descended upon the building. After the attack, the black family requested to move out of the Midway Airport Homes, and police had to escort the black family off the premises. White aggression and mob violence successfully preserved Midway's homogenous demographic. Bradford Hunt argues the failure of the Airport Homes integration marked a turning point for the CHA. The \\"racial liberalism\\" that CHA and Mayor Kelly promoted was directly challenged by white desire to uphold the racial purity of segregated neighborhoods. Chicago City Council members and aldermen also noticed Kelly's increased effort to maintain the CHA integration initiative over other mismanaged and corrupt areas of the Democratic political machine. To maintain the influence of the Democratic party in the city, key party leaders encouraged Kelly to retire in 1947. He was replaced by Martin Kennelly, a pro-business, anti-CHA Democrat who prioritized private real estate interests and the expansion of the downtown business district. = Fernwood Park Homes = Fernwood Park is a neighborhood in the larger Roseland community on the far south side of Chicago. Other neighborhoods in Roseland include Lilydale, Princeton Park, Rosemoor, Sheldon Heights, West Roseland, and part of West Chesterfield. In the early 1940s, the neighborhood was an ethnically mixed European immigrant community. The CHA initiated the construction of the Fernwood Park Homes, a one story project with 87 two- bedroom-units for veterans and their families. Elizabeth Wood revealed to Fernwood Park community members in May of 1947 that the project would welcome white and black veterans. Since Fernwood Park was the only remaining white neighborhood in its immediate area, white residents recognized the promise of integration as a threat to the stability of their white homogenous environment.  Rioting  Unlike other race riots in Chicago history, there was no specific event or incident that sparked the rioting; Historian Arnold Hirsch suggests that the mob spontaneously organized outside of the housing project the evening after the families moved in on August 13, 1947. Scholars have estimated that anywhere from 500 to 5,000 white rioters gathered to reclaim the neighborhood. The violence lasted three full days, during which white gangs damaged property belonging to African Americans. Rioters threw stones both the residents of the project and the project itself, shattering windows, then set fire to it. Members of the mob also pulled black people out of automobiles to beat them with clubs. Approximately 100 cars were attacked, and at least 35 black people were wounded. Police set up barricades in order to identify and isolate the area of violence, which stretched from 95th Street to 130th Street going north/south, and from Michigan Avenue to Vincennes Avenue going east/west. = Police response = Hirsch argues that police contributed to the violence against black occupants. Nearly 1,000 police officers were ordered to protect the Fernwood Park project residents, but overall, the Chicago police did little to stop or disperse organized mobs or gangs, assumedly because policemen who protected black residents were also the subject of mob violence. Additionally, the police reportedly failed to stop the motor attacks as well. Since the largest number of police officers were ordered to protect the housing project and its inhabitants, there were no available reinforcements to safeguard both the project and the black motorists. Instead of sending squad cars to the streets where violence against drivers occurred, police redirected traffic from four-lane main street Halsted Ave. to a two-lane side street only one block from Halsted, which meant that \\"traffic became hopelessly snarled, [and] black motorists remained within easy reach of the mob.\\" Thus, black drivers were especially vulnerable to mob activity. The Chicago Police Department established units at the projects in the two weeks following the riot. Nearly 700 police officers remained in the area near Fernwood Park Homes to protect black residents from any violence, and the order of police protection was not removed for nearly six months after the riot.  Aftermath  = Arrests and injuries = Only 113 people were arrested for rioting at the Fernwood Park Homes. Hirsch presents an ethnic analysis of the reported arrests, in which the largest European ethnicity represented was Dutch (26.3%); other ethnicities were German (14.7%), Irish (7.7%), Italian (6.5%) Scandinavian (5.6%), Polish (5.3%), and Slavic (4.4%). Additionally, at least 35 black people reported injuries from white mob violence. = African American reaction to the riot = African American neighborhoods that surrounded Fernwood Park threatened to retaliate against the white mobs. Residents of Morgan Park, one of the neighborhoods that bordered Fernwood Park, and inhabitants of the Fernwood Homes threw stones at white people who walked past the project. Violence only deescalated when the Chicago Commission on Human Relations and Archibald Carey, Jr., an African American alderman, addressed Roseland's black population. Additionally, the African American population in the Roseland area increased exponentially following the riot. Takei cites census data for Chicago neighborhoods to track the increase‚Äîwhile only 4.2% of Roseland was African American in 1940, the black population grew to represent 18.4% of the community by 1950. Statistics from the next few decades, especially 1970 and 1980, illustrate rapid white flight from the area, as in 1970 African Americans represented 55.1% of Roseland's population, and by 1980, 97.5%. = Political response = Both the Fernwood Park riot and the Airport Homes riots highlighted white intransigence and refusal to accept black integration into white spaces. The integration objectives of the CHA \\"proved too fragile to withstand the prejudices, preferences, and mobility of whites\\" who resided in segregated communities. In response to the riots, Mayor Kennelly and Chicago City Council aimed to reduce the CHA's influence and restore the Democratic party's control over housing initiatives. Thus, new policy required that CHA gain approval from the Housing Committee of City Council before beginning construction of public housing projects. Similarly, Kennelly appointed the Chicago Land Clearance Commission in 1947, ultimately removing the CHA's ability to designate land for slum clearance and renewal. Finally, Chicago public housing moved to an open occupancy agenda rather than an integration agenda. While an integration agenda actively promoted and guided the movement of black people into traditionally white areas, an open occupancy agenda encouraged black people to select housing in any areas, but integration was not a priority whatsoever. Thus, while black people were technically allowed to select housing in traditionally white areas, other barriers like racially restrictive housing covenants, redlining, blockbusting, or white flight as a response to changing neighborhood demographics ultimately prevented the movement of African Americans from Chicago's traditionally black areas. = Chicago police disaster response reform = In just a few months after the Fernwood Park race riot, the Chicago Police Department (CPD) engaged in tactical changes to ensure faster response times to crises. Quick mobilization and Plan Five, or the disaster plan, \\"brought 27 squad cars to a designated location in less than fifteen minutes.\\" Riot and civil disorder control also called for the organization of special police battalions, in which a total of 660 men and 98 police vehicles could arrive at any location in Chicago on \\"'short notice.'\\" Last and most significantly, the Chicago police promoted heavier levels of policing in areas where black people were moving in at higher rates. While these reforms improved disaster response, the department failed to address racial bias in individual officers in effective ways‚Äîhuman relations turned to hour-long classroom training seminars that would hopefully alter the lifelong biases of officers. Without meaningful bias training, systemic racism in the department hindered the ability of CPD to limit or end race riots.

Description The flag of the Novosibirsk Region is a rectangular panel which shows five different-sized stripes of red, white, blue, white, and green (left-to-right). Between the red and green stripes, two black sable are depicted holding a yellow loaf of korovai with a salt shaker. Underneath, the white and blue stripes are crossed by a horizontal narrow belt which is colored black on the white and white on the blue. The ratio of the width of the stripes to the length of the flag is 5: 3: 2: 3: 5, respectively. The ratio of the width of the flag to the length is 2: 3. The ratio of the width of the belt to the width of the flag is 1:80. On the initial sketch drawn by the Novosibirsk artist Grigory Kuzhelev, a blue stripe was used in place of the red stripe. Blue was to symbolize the Ob River; white, purity of thoughts; and green, natural wealth. The red bar was added at the insistence of the Communist Party faction of the Regional Council. Symbolism The color and symbolic meaning of the flag are reflective of the Siberian region and the historical heraldry of Novosibirsk, of which white, green, red and blue are the main colors. White symbolizes purity, devotion, and faith, as well as the color of the harsh Siberian winter. Green symbolizes hope, abundance, rebirth, and vitality, personifying the natural diversity and beauty of the fertile land of Novosibirsk. Red symbolizes courage and the memory of the heroism of the Novosibirsk people in defending their homeland. Blue symbolizes the Ob River and the numerous lakes and rivers occupying almost a third of the region. In the center of the flag is the emblem of the region, two black sables depicted holding a yellow loaf of korovai with a salt shaker.

Whites in the neighborhood rioted, attacking other whites, partially based on rumors and misinformation that blacks were meeting to take over their neighborhood. Origin According to labor historian Rick Halpern the U.P.W.A (United Packing Workers of America) were holding an interracial union meeting at the home of Aaron Bindman (a member of the CIO's longshoremen's union), Louise Bindman and Bill and Gussie Sennett. The neighbors were disturbed by the presence of the attending black shop stewards and insisted they leave the area, and when Bindman refused this request two days of rioting began. Although one hundred policeman were on the scene, the crowd almost destroyed Bindman's home. This is a very interesting and perhaps overlooked flash point in the history of the civil rights movement because it marks a place where the struggles of labor moved beyond the plants and into the larger community where it joined forces with other activist organizations. Indeed the UPWA quickly emerged at the forefront of community wide mobilization. They publicized and formed a committee that brought considerable pressure to bear upon Mayor Kennelly, who flatly refused to make any statement about the disturbance, demanding that he ensured adequate police protection. A well-publicized move to research mayoral impeachment prompted Kennelly to issue a statement and meet with the commissioner of police. The committee also help expose the exploitative practices of banks and real estate companies that were promoting and profiting from \\"white flight.\\"Rick Halpern Down on This Killing Floor / Black and White Workers in Chicago's Packinghouses 1904‚Äì54 p.240 The origin of the race riots in Chicago was blacks moving into the neighborhood. In Englewood this took place on the basis of a rumor. Supposedly the house at 5643 S. Peoria St. was going to be bought by a black. This rumor was false, but it nonetheless triggered racial upheaval of white nationalists. The riot Hundreds of whites gathered outside the home where the meeting was being held on the night of November 8. At about 9:30 p.m., a young boy threw a rock at house and others in the crowd followed. The rioting lasted for five days, with police doing little to stop the violence and even encouraged more violence at times. Whites in the neighborhood beat blacks and white people whom they believed to be outsiders or communists. At least thirteen people were beaten severely enough to be in hospital. Size and form At first there were some several hundred rioters. This rose to a peak of up to 10,000 rioters. The white residents did not want blacks to be in their community and also cried out against Jews and Communists being allegedly involved. It was alleged that a local Catholic parish was responsible for organizing the gangs behind the violence.

While at 42 Entertainment she has produced such notable ARGs as ilovebees (for Microsoft's launch of Halo 2), Dead Man's Tale (for Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), Year Zero (for Nine Inch Nails), Why So Serious? (for Warner Bros.' The Dark Knight), and Flynn Lives (for Disney's Tron: Legacy). Two of these projects, Year Zero and Why So Serious?, were awarded a Cyber Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions, the world's largest international advertising festival.  Career  Bonds began her career in 1980 as an industrial engineer at Walt Disney World in Florida. After seven years as a systems engineer at Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects, the famed Skunk Works then based in Burbank, she returned to Disney as a creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering, the company's design and development arm. Working as a senior show producer throughout most of the 1990s, she directed the design, development, and construction of major attractions and new ride systems. Her portfolio included such blockbuster attractions as the Indiana Jones Adventure at Disneyland and Alien Encounter and Mission: SPACE at Disney World. During her tenure at Disney she also produced the exterior of ABC's Times Square Studios, the home of Good Morning America. She left Disney after ten years to become Chief Design and Production Officer for Cyan Worlds, the company behind the top-selling PC games Myst and Riven. In 2003, Bonds joined with Jordan Weisman, Sean Stewart, and Elan Lee, veterans of the pioneering ARG The Beast, in the launch of what was then called 4orty 2wo Entertainment. With Joe DiNunzio, also a former Imagineering executive, as president, the company created a number of successful ARGs, starting with ilovebees and continuing with Last Call Poker for Activision, Dead Man's Poker for Disney, and Vanishing Point for Microsoft's Windows Vista. In 2007, after DiNunzio left to form Fido Management and Weisman left to form Smith & Tinker, Bonds became CEO. The departure later that year of Stewart, Lee, and CTO Jim Stewartson to form Fourth Wall Studios, together with the 2006 merger of 42 Entertainment with 3 Pin Media, left Bonds in charge of a new creative team headed by Alex Lieu and Michael Borys of 3 Pin. In early 2007, during this transition period, Bonds produced the Year Zero ARG for Nine Inch Nails, a work that was hailed by Rolling Stone as \\"the most innovative promotion scheme since the leaked sex tape.\\"\\"Year Zero\\" Project = Way Cooler Than \\"Lost,\\" Rolling Stone Staff Blog, Feb. 22, 2007.

The partners are the Canadian Wildlife Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the United States Geological Survey, Ducks Unlimited, Bird Studies Canada, the Pacific Flyway Council, and the council for U.S. Flyways. It is one of three species joint ventures operating within the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. The partnership studies 15 species of sea ducks: Barrow's goldeneye, black scoter, bufflehead, common eider, common goldeneye, common merganser, harlequin duck, hooded merganser, king eider, long-tailed duck, red-breasted merganser, spectacled eider, Steller's eider, surf scoter, and white-winged scoter. These represent one third of all waterfowl species in North America. Four of these species are threatened in some of their habitats: the harlequin duck in eastern Canada, the Barrow's goldeneye in eastern Canada and Maine, and the spectacled eider and Steller's eider in the United States. Four primary factors were identified for the declining populations of sea ducks in North America: \\"lack of knowledge about their ecology, contaminants, unsustainable hunting, and habitat loss and degradation\\". Activities such as \\"logging, fuel-wood harvesting, and land developments\\" have resulted in loss of breeding habitats for cavity-nesting sea ducks, particularly the mergansers, goldeneyes, and buffleheads. Habitat loss includes the effects of coastal development, resource exploration and development, use of waterways for shipping, and other large-scale environmental changes. Contamination results from oil spills and the discharge of heavy metals into the water system. Conferences A conference is held every three years between partners and scientists involved in the study and preservation of sea duck populations. The first was held in Victoria, British Columbia in 2002, and subsequent events were held in Annapolis, Maryland (2005), Quebec City (2008), and Seward, Alaska (2011). The next conference will be held in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland in September 2014.

The name refers to the bishop Bernward of Hildesheim (960-1022) who was canonized by Pope Celestine III.  History  Saint Bernward's Church Interior. Altar and retable. Statue of Saint Bernward. The church was built by the architect Richard Herzig from Hanover in 1905‚Äì1907, in a neoromanesque style.Jens-Uwe Brinkmann: Hildesheim - wie es war, p.68. D√ºsseldorf 1976. From 1895‚Äì1913, Herzig built 43 churches of this style in the diocese of Hildesheim. When St. Bernward's Church was built, the romanesque westwork of St. Andrew's Church, Hildesheim and the Cathedral of Hildesheim served as examples. The church was consecrated by bishop Adolf Bertram on 3 November 1907. During World War II, St. Bernward's Church was heavily damaged by bombs on 22 February 1945.Hermann Seeland: Zerst√∂rung und Untergang Alt- Hildesheims, p.14. Hildesheim 1947. The windows were destroyed, the vault and the roof collapsed. The building could no longer be used for services. Then on 22 March 1945 the church was completely destroyed by incendiary bombs. Only a part of the tower and some walls remained standing.Herrmann Seeland: Im Weltkrieg zerst√∂rte Kirchen und Wohlfahrtsanstalten im Bistum Hildesheim, p.27. Hildesheim 1948. The reconstruction was started as early as November 1948. When it was completed, St. Bernward's Church, the first destroyed church of Hildesheim to be rebuilt, was consecrated by bishop Joseph Godehard Machens in 1949.  Description  St. Bernward's Church is a basilica consisting of three naves, but unlike the other churches in Hildesheim, its apse and the altar are in the north of the building.Anker Twachtmann-Schlichter: Baudenkmale in Niedersachsen, p. 228.

Biography Klapdor- Kleingrothaus studied physics at the University of Hamburg and received his PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in 1969 with a thesis on gamma-ray spectroscopy at a particle accelerator. From 1969 until 2007 he worked at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, originally studying heavy ion reactions. He received his habilitation in Hamburg in 1971 and in Heidelberg two years later. He has been a professor at the University of Heidelberg since 1980. Important work Klapdor-Kleingrothaus works on nuclear astrophysics and on the study of weak interaction in nuclear physics, in particular on double beta decay. He proposed and was subsequently spokesperson of the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment, which ran from 1990 until 2003 in the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, near Rome. This experiment is currently the most sensitive double beta decay experiment.K Nakamura et al (Particle Data Group) 2010 J. Phys.

Among the largest and most distinguished buildings in the western section of Boston, the imposing Romanesque Revival church dominates the rotary where it is located and provides an interesting contrast to the Gothic St. Theresa Roman Catholic Church, a mile down Centre Street. Holy Name Church is a relatively large church. It has 2 floors, and mass can be said on either, although the upper church is larger. Founding and early development The parish was founded in 1927 under the leadership of Fr. William P. McNamara, the first pastor. Plans for a new large church of Romanesque Revival style were acquired in 1929 and building began. Although the basement church was ready for Midnight Mass in 1929 work on the superstructure progressed more slowly and the church was not completed until 1939. Architecture The architect of the church was Edward T. P. Graham who designed many Roman Catholic churches in Boston and the Midwest. The design of the dome in the main sanctuary is replicated from that of the Basilica di San Clemente in Rome. St. Clemente had been the titular church of Boston Cardinal William Henry O'Connell when Holy Name was built. Other Buildings in the Holy Name Complex A large Colonial Revival style rectory, also designed by Graham, is situated directly behind the church. The Holy Name Elementary School, Parish Hall and Convent designed in 1953 by architects Perry, Shaw and Hepburn is located directly across the street. The stained glass was provided by the studios of Wilbur H. Burnham, Boston http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/wilbhbur.htm The records of Wilbur H. Burnam Studios at the smithsonian Archives of American Art who would also supply glass to St. Theresa Church of West Roxbury. Wicks Pipe Organ Wicks organ, designed by Heny Vincent Willis In 1938 the church became home to one of the most distinguished organs in Boston, a large 3 manual organ opus 1691http://organ.wicks.com/display_page.php?p=200&s;=1691 built by the Wicks Organ Company It was designed by Henry Vincent Willis, grandson of \\"Father\\" Willis of the prestigious British organ building firm who was the tonal designer for Wicks at the time. He designed several highly regarded organs for Wicks including the Holy Name instrument and a slightly larger 4 manual instrument, opus 1503http://organ.wicks.com/display_page.php?p=200&s;=1503 for the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria, Illinois. Prior to his employment at Wicks Willis had worked for the Midmar-Losh Organ Company where he was heavily involved in the development of the largest organ in the World, the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ in the Atlantic City Convention Center. The pipes are divided between two large cases in the gallery and a separate 16 rank instrument located in the sanctuary. Both organs are controlled by twin 3-manual drawknob consoles, one in the gallery and the second in the sanctuary directly behind the altar. The organ was one of the instruments featured in the 2000 convention of the Organ Historical Society. In 2005, after more than 60 years of daily use, a complete refurbishing of the organ was begun. This work was completed in 2006. Gallery Image:HolyNameWR Rectory1.jpgExterior detail: Holy Name Rectory, also by Edward T. P. Graham. Directly behind the church.

Ludwik's father, Benedicto Tarsze≈Ñski, held the title \\"Grande de Polonia\\". The family Tarsze≈Ñski belongs to the Lubicz noble clan of Poland, and bears that heraldic coat of arms.

The Accumulated Campaign Service Medal is hallmarked on the rim to the right of the suspension fixing. The 2011 version of the medal is not hallmarked. Criteria The Accumulated Campaign Service Medal was originally granted to holders of the General Service Medal (1962) who had completed accumulated campaign service of 36 months since 14 August 1969, with a clasp for each period of further 36 months of campaign service. When the ribbon only is worn, a silver rosette is worn on the ribbon for each clasp, with a single gold rosette indicating four clasps.

During the years toward the end of and immediately following World War II, Bessac served with the Office of Strategic Services (O.S.S.) in Western China and Mongolia, and while escaping from Communist Chinese forces in 1950 on their way to Tibet, Bessac was part of a group mistakenly attacked by Tibetan forces in which Central Intelligence Agency spy Douglas Mackiernan was killed, making him the CIA's first agent killed in action.  Biography  Bessac was born on January 13, 1922, in Lodi, California and earned his undergraduate degree at the University of the Pacific, where he majored in history. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II. After studying Chinese language at Cornell University, Bessac was sent by the O.S.S. to China, where he served until 1947. He studied language at Fujen University in present-day Beijing after completing service with the O.S.S and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship.Weber, Bruce. \\"Frank Bessac, Scholar and Adventurer, Dies at 88\\", The New York Times, December 25, 2010.

In the Gobi Desert studying anthropology in Inner Mongolia, Bessac was forced to flee in the wake of advancing Chinese Communist forces and decided to escape to Tibet by embarking on a journey of to Tihwa (now known as √úr√ºmqi) and from there through Tibet and across the Himalayas to India. While approaching Tibet, Bessac's group was mistakenly attacked by a group of Tibetan border guards, who shot and killed three members of his group before Bessac ran towards the soldiers while carrying a white flag. Among the dead was CIA agent Douglas Mackiernan, who had been sent to monitor actions by the Soviet Union in the area around the border between China and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, near the location where the Soviets had conducted their initial nuclear bomb test in August 1949. The Tibetan troops who had been involved in the attack that led to Mackiernan's death were convicted by a military court in Lhasa and sentenced to mutilation, with the leader of the group \\"to have his nose and both ears cut off\\", though after Bessac intervened for leniency, the punishment was changed so that the leader received 200 lashes and the other members of the patrol were also lashed.Bessac, Frank; as told to Burke, James. \\"These Tibetans Killed an American and Get the Lash for it\\", Life (magazine), November 13, 1950.

Homes, a school, a store and company offices were built in town. Despite the heavy mining activity, high quality sulfur was difficult to find. Production slowed in the 1940s and 1950s, and in 1966, the mine and mill shut down. By the end of the 1970s, Sulphurdale was abandoned. History The site that was to become Sulphurdale was surveyed by Charles Dickart, who discovered a large body of sulfur ore just south of Cove Fort in 1870. Minimal work was done until 1883, when a thermal plant was built to process the extracted sulfur. Steady production began in 1890. 1,000 tons of sulfur were produced annually for fifteen years. The mining company that operated the mines at Sulphurdale built 30 homes for the workers, a schoolhouse, a company store, and company offices. For a time, the town was unofficially known as Morrissey, after the operator of the mines. Twice every week, freighters hauled 20 tons of sulfur to the Union Pacific loading docks at Black Rock. Only the high grade ore was considered useful; the rest of the ore went unused. Although the Sulphurdale mines were fully operational, very little sulfur was mined. A sulfur mill that was built in 1951 did not produce much high quality sulfur. Production began to slow down in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1961 the Sulphurdale Chemical Company built a mill and began commercial production in 1965; however, the company owner died in 1966 and the mill shut down. After seventy years of activity, the mines at Sulphurdale were closed. In 1985, a geothermal power system was installed near Sulphurdale, and the power system is currently in operation, producing electricity for Provo. The hydrothermal system it exploits is one of the largest in the western United States, with temperature anomalies of up to per kilometer. The schoolhouse and a couple of homes remain in the town proper.

Billy Connolly has cited McLean as his favourite comedian. McLean started working in comedy in 1999, and was a finalist in both the BBC New Comedy Awards and the Channel 4 programme So You Think You‚Äôre Funny. In 2002 McLean made his debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with his one-man show Des McLean 5 Stars and appeared on the BBC series The Live Floor Show. The following year he performed at the Glasgow International and New York comedy festivals. In 2005 McLean was sought by Radio Clyde to provide sketches for the Bowie at Breakfast programme on Clyde 1. He soon became the co-host on the breakfast show with George Bowie, with the two men winning Sony Radio Academy Awards in the Best Breakfast and Entertainment Categories. McLean recorded a series of wind-up telephone calls for the programme, fooling stars that included Sean Connery, Rod Stewart and Joan Rivers. The daily calls became a series of four top selling CD releases, The Best of The 8.10 Sketches. McLean went on to host his own comedy sketch shows Friday Night Comedy and Des McLean's Sunday Sketch. While still hosting daily radio shows McLean starred as The Tin Man in the Glasgow Pavilion Theatre pantomime Wizard of Oz in 2008 and Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio in 2009. In 2008 his flair for more serious acting won him the lead role in the theatre drama Two Tales of Love and Loss. McLean's live stand-up comedy DVDs became top sellers in Scotland, live at City Halls in 2007, Talkin Aboot Live 2009, and Is this the way to Armadillo in 2010, his stand-up show at The Clyde Auditorium was recorded as a television special for STV. McLean left Radio Clyde in 2010 and has worked since on television as an on-location presenter in Scotland for The One Show on BBC One. He has also hosted various STV programmes including Hogmanay, The Hour and Too Good To Waste. Streetcast, McLean's comedy podcast, has also received rave reviews and his many YouTube sketches have over a million views. In October 2011 McLean completed a tour of New Zealand playing venues such as The Vector Arena and Hawkes Bay Opera House. In January 2012 it was reported that McLean would be playing politician Tommy Sheridan, who was convicted of perjury during 2010, in a new play I, Tommy, written by Rab C. Nesbitt creator Ian Pattison. Mclean's performance as Sheridan achieved critical acclaim from both critics and leading actors. David Hayman on BBC2 Review show described it as \\"Extraordinary.\\" The Times called it \\"Pitch Perfect\\" and The Scotsman \\"devastatingly accurate\\". The production played at the Edinburgh fringe, toured Scotland and finished the year at the Kings Theatre, Glasgow. In June 2013 McLean performed his stand up at the \\"Top of the Riv\\" in the iconic Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas. There was a further run of I, Tommy in late 2013 with Rosie Kane playing herself. In 2014 Des McLean announced a new nationwide tour and released a live DVD, Des Mclean's A-Z of Scotland.

A relative of the modern mountain goat, which is the only existing species in the genus Oreamnos, O. harringtoni became extinct around 11,000 B.C. Fossil record Frontal view of skull Harrington's mountain goat was first described in the 1930s by paleontologist Chester Stock. Stock based his initial description on finds of skull fragments and metapodial bones from Smith Creek Cave in the Great Basin of Nevada. In 1937 he authored a Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Science article titled \\"A new mountain goat from the Quaternary of Smith Creek Cave, Nevada\\". Later finds in Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, and the Grand Canyon have included intact skulls, metapodials, keratinous horn sheaths, dung, hair, muscle and ligament. Characteristics Harrington's mountain goat was smaller than today's mountain goats, and had a longer, narrower face accompanied by thinner, smaller horns. Dung finds suggest that the goats frequented caves in the Grand Canyon during spring and possibly late winter and early summer. Their diet seems to have consisted of both grasses and browsing of conifers such as spruce, Douglas fir, limber pine, and water birch. Extinction Harrington's mountain goat existed for at least 19,000 years prior to disappearing around 11,000 BC. The extinction is known to have coincided with the disappearance of at least 25 genera of land mammals, such as the Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis), and the arrival of Native American hunters of the Clovis culture in the region.

SH-53 travels northeast from Washington State Route 290 (SR 290) at the Washington state border near Hauser to a short concurrency with SH-41 in Rathdrum. From Rathdrum, the highway continues east to end at U.S. Route 95 (US-95) north of Hayden. The Hauser to Rathdrum segment first appeared on a map in 1926, while the continuation of the route to the Hayden area appeared in 1937, completing an unnumbered state highway. SH-53 was designated in 1953 after all unnumbered state highways were assigned numbers. Route description SH-53 begins at the Washington state border southwest of Hauser at the eastern terminus of Washington State Route 290, which serves Spokane, Washington. Trent Road travels northeast, paralleling the Spokane International branch of the Union Pacific Railroad, through farmland and several small suburban communities towards Rathdrum. The highway serves the northern area of the city, passing strip malls and businesses, to an intersection with SH-41. At the intersection, SH-53 turns southeast and begins a short concurrency with SH-41 to cross the railroad via an overpass. The highway splits from SH-41 near Lakeland High School and travels due east through a commercial district. From the commercial district, the roadway travels towards farmland and sharply turns north before cutting back southeast over a UPRR railroad line. After the overpass, SH-53 ends at a signalized intersection with US-95 north of Hayden. The Idaho Transportation Department has plans to straighten the east end of the highway and replace the signalized intersection with an interchange by the end of 2020. History SH-53 first appeared as a roadway from Hauser to Rathdrum in a 1926 map of Idaho. By 1937, the road was extended east to US-95 north of Hayden and became an unnumbered state highway. The highway was officially designated as SH-53 after a meeting of the Idaho Board of Highway Directors on July 25, 1953 that approved a number for all unnumbered state highways.

He was the first casualty of the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, executed by firing squad by the Germans shortly after his capture.  Biography  An engineering student before the war, Negri enlisted in the Regia Aeronautica in the course of the hostilities. After graduating from the Italian Air Force Academy in Caserta he was assigned to 4 Stormo (Prancing Stallion)The \\"prancing stallion\\" was the personal emblem of Italy's World War I top ace, Francesco Baracca. After his death, his mother donated the emblem to Enzo Ferrari who used it as a brand for his sports cars. as a Sottotenente (second Lieutenant) pilot. He had not been in the unit for long when the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces was made public on 8 September 1943, ending hostilities between Italy and the Allies but de facto opening the war with their former allies. Negri, together with most 4 Stormo personnel, flew to Apulia where the Royal Family had found a safe haven after fleeing from Rome. However, this \\"move\\" was not made for merely political reasons: the Stormo had very strong ties with Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (and therefore with the House of Savoy) although Amedeo had left the command of the unit by the late 1930s to take up the place of Governor General of Italian East Africa and had died the year before as a POW of the British in Kenya. At any rate, Amedeo's legacy with 4 Stormo is so strong that the unit bears his name to the present day. Shortly after, Regia Aeronautica (officially renamed Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force) was operational on the Allied side, flying ground attack and supply missions to relieve pressure on Regio Esercito units stuck in the Balkans and embedded in the local Resistance movements. In one such occasion, on 21 September 1943, Negri volunteered to drop a cylinder containing a message for an Italian unit encircled in Koritza, Albania. Hit by Flak, Negri was forced to land and was immediately captured by the Wehrmacht. Brought to a show trial, he was sentenced to death and shot on 23 September. He could not enjoy the protection of the Geneva Convention because there had not been any formal declaration of war between the Kingdom of Italy and Nazi Germany (which would take place only on 13 October 1943). Sottotenente Carlo Negri received the posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valor for this action. A little more than 60 years after his death (31 October 2003) 61 Stormo was named after him. This Italian Air Force Wing is based at Galatina, the same airbase from which Negri had taken off for his fateful flight. The dedication ceremony was attended by his nephew and namesake, manager Carlo Puri Negri, a holder of top offices in the Pirelli rubber and real estate company. As a matter of fact, the young officer was related to the well-known Italian industrial family by the side of his mother Margherita.http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2003/ottobre/31/Ciampi_Resistenza_studiata_scuolaco_0_031031060.shtml Every year the Pirelli family organizes a regatta, the Carlo Negri cup in his memory.

The rivalry dates back to 1913, when both teams were among the top college football programs in the United States. Series history The first Army‚ÄìNotre Dame game in 1913 is generally regarded as the game that established the national reputation of the Fighting Irish. In that game, Notre Dame revolutionized the forward pass in a stunning 35‚Äì13 victory. For years it was \\"The Game\\" on Notre Dame's schedule, played at Yankee Stadium in New York. During the 1940s, the rivalry with the Army Cadets reached its zenith. This was because both teams were extremely successful and met several times in key games (including one of the Games of the Century, a scoreless tie in 1946). In 1944, the Cadets administered the worst defeat in Notre Dame football history, crushing the Fighting Irish 59‚Äì0. The following year, it was more of the same, a 48‚Äì0 blitzkrieg. After meeting every year since 1919, the series went on a ten-year hiatus starting in 1947 and lasting until 1957. The game was played in South Bend for the first time and the Fighting Irish won 27‚Äì7. Since then, there have been infrequent meetings over the past several decades, and Army's last win was in 1958. Like Navy, due to the small capacity of Army's Michie Stadium, the Cadets played their home games at a neutral site, which for a number of years was Yankee Stadium and before that, the Polo Grounds. In 1957, the game was played in Philadelphia's Municipal (later John F. Kennedy Memorial) Stadium while in 1965, the teams met at the year-old Shea Stadium in Queens. They last met at the original Yankee Stadium in 1969; it was played at West Point in 1973, and the Fighting Irish rolled 62‚Äì3 on their way to the national championship. In more recent times, games in which Army was the host have been played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Notre Dame leads the series . Their latest matchup came in 2016, when the teams met for the 2016 Shamrock series in the Alamodome in San Antonio; Notre Dame won easily, and the Irish have won the last fifteen, the longest streak in the rivalry's history. =The 1944 game= It had been thirteen years since Army had beaten Notre Dame. In fact, the last time Army had scored against the Irish was in 1938.Gildea, William; Jennison, Christopher (1976). The Fighting Irish: Notre Dame Football Through the Years. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice- Hall. The Irish were the defending national champions, but lost many key players to graduation and the armed services. The Irish even lost head coach Frank Leahy to military service, and were now being led by Ed McKeever. Notre Dame went into the game 5‚Äì1 and ranked 5, coming off a 32‚Äì13 loss to Navy. The Army squad was being led by Glenn Davis and Doc Blanchard. The Cadets also had a quarterback named Doug Kenna, and a transfer from the University of Texas, sprinter Max Minor. Army overwhelmed the Irish. Kenna opened the scoring with a run for touchdown. He wasn't done, as he played defense as well, intercepting an Irish pass, which led to a scoring run by Minor. Kenna then pulled a trifecta of sorts, when he passed for a third score. Davis, a late scratch as a starter, also intercepted a pass, and had two offensive runs for scores. By halftime, Army had a commanding 33‚Äì0 lead. Kenna added another scoring pass, and Davis another run for a score. Even Army's back-ups got into the act. Harold Tavzel, a second string tackle, intercepted a poorly thrown pass from the Irish quarterback, and jogged a few yards for a score. When the game was over, Army won 59‚Äì0, handing the Irish the worst loss in the program's history. The Irish would recover, winning their last three games to finish 8‚Äì2 and ranked 9 in the nation. When asked by a reporter about the score, Army halfback Doc Blanchard said \\"If there was anyone to blame for the size of the margin, it was Notre Dame, which fired our desire to win with its long humiliation of Army teams.\\" Game results Venues * The Plain, West Point, NY: 1913-22 (10 times) * Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, NY: 1923 (once) * Polo Grounds.

It is the city's largest place of worship for Sunni Muslims. Originally called the Umm al-Ma'arik (\\"Mother of All Battles\\") mosque, it was designed to commemorate Saddam Hussein's self-proclaimed victory in the 1991 Gulf War and was intended to serve as a personal tribute to Saddam himself. It is located in the Sunni-populated al-Adel area of western Baghdad. Costing 7.5 million to build, the mosque's cornerstone was laid on Saddam's 61st birthday on 28 April 1998. It was formally completed on 28 April 2001 in time for the ten-year anniversary of the Gulf War. Although never confirmed by his regime or himself during his lifetime, there has been speculation that it was intended to have been Saddam's final resting place.  Architectural features  The mosque is built of white limestone with blue mosaic decorations. Many architectural features of the mosque and the surrounding complex allude to Saddam Hussein or to the Gulf War of 1990‚Äì91. Western observers have described the mosque's eight minarets as resembling weapons, but the Iraqi government rejects that interpretation. The mosque has four minarets surrounding the dome, and four more at the outer corners of the complex. The inner minarets are said to resemble Kalashnikov rifle barrels, while those on the perimeter are described as looking like Scud ballistic missiles. Other features clearly refer to Saddam and his politics. The outer minarets are reportedly each 43 meters high, commemorating the 43 days of \\"U.S. aggression\\" in January‚ÄìFebruary 1991, during the Gulf War. The other four minarets are 37 meters in height, commemorating Saddam's birth in 1937. At the center of the mosque is a pool \\"shaped like the Arab world.\\" The pool has 28 fountains, which together with the four 37-meter minarets represent Saddam's birth date, 28 April 1937. At the center of the pool there stands a wide mosaic representation of Saddam's thumbprint, inset with an enlarged image of his signature. A Qur'an written in ink made of Saddam's blood was formerly displayed within the mosque complex. Red, white and black Iraqi flags are painted on the peaks of the inner minarets. Following the fall of Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the mosque was taken over by a Sunni group called the Association of Muslim Scholars. It became a recruiting site and propaganda centre for the early Iraqi insurgency. The association became a de facto Al Qaeda ally; its leader Harith Suleiman al- Dhari, who operated out of the mosque, is said to have played a key role in mobilizing insurgents during the 2004 fighting in Fallujah, west of Baghdad. In 2007, the association was expelled by the Sunni Endowment, a quasi- governmental agency responsible for Sunni mosques in Iraq, which took control of Umm al-Qura.

The consumer generally has to pay at least the shipping and handling costs to receive the premium. Premiums are sometimes referred to as prizes, although historically the word \\"prize\\" has been used to denote (as opposed to a premium) an item that is packaged with the product (or available from the retailer at the time of purchase) and requires no additional payment over the cost of the product. Premiums predominantly fall into three categories, free premiums, self- liquidating premiums and in-or on-package premiums. Free premiums are sales promotions that involve the consumer purchasing a product in order to receive a free gift or reward. An example of this is the ‚Äòbuy a coffee and receive a free muffin‚Äô campaign used by some coffee houses. Self-liquidating premiums are when a consumer is expected to pay a designated monetary value for a gift or item. New World's Little Shopper Campaign is an example of this: consumers were required to spend a minimum amount of money in order to receive a free collectible item. The in-or out-package premium is where small gifts are included with the package. The All Black collectors‚Äô cards found in Sanitarium Weet Bix boxes are a good example of this.Boundless.

A good campaign will: * strengthen early-stage consumer relationships * encourage continued repeat business * assist with targeting a specific audience or cohort of your target market * create an emotional connection with your consumer by serving as a motivational driver to investigate further or purchase a product.Jutkins, R. (Unknown). How to Use Advertising Specialties and Premiums in Direct Marketing Advertising Specialties and Premiums in Direct Marketing. Retrieved from Presentation- Pointers.com: http://www.presentation-pointers.com/showarticle/articleid/432/ It's also important not to confuse premiums with other forms of sales promotions as there are a number of ways in which retailers can entice consumers. History =Early premiums= A merchant in Sudbury, New Hampshire, started giving out tokens made of copper when a customer made a purchase in 1793. The customer could then exchange the tokens for products in the store. This practice caught on and was used by many merchants throughout the 19th and 20th Century. Sweet Home laundry soap, a product of the B. A. Babbit Company, came with certificates that could be collected and redeemed for color lithographs. Beginning in 1872, the Grand Union Tea Company gave tickets to customers that could be exchanged for merchandise in the company catalog of Grand Union stores. The first trading stamps were introduced in 1891, the Blue Stamp Trading System, where stamps affixed to booklets could be redeemed for store products. =The business of premium redemption= The Sperry and Hutchinson Company, started in 1896 in Jackson, Michigan, was the first third-party provider of trading stamps for various companies, including dry goods dealers, gas stations and later supermarkets. S&H; Green Stamps, as the company was commonly called, opened its first redemption center in 1897. Customers could take their filled booklets of \\"green stamps\\" and redeem them for household products, kitchen items, and personal items. World War II put the trading stamps premium business on hold for a while, but when the G.I.s returned, the economy was robust, and the trading stamps business took off like a storm when numerous third-party companies created their own trading stamp programs to offer to supermarkets and other retailers. The bottom fell out of the trading stamp business in 1965, when supermarkets stopped issuing stamps altogether and started spending more money to advertise lower prices. Trading stamps have gone by the wayside of the modern retail marketing method of loyalty cards used widely in supermarkets where, instead of premiums, customers benefit from savings and convenience through coupon-free discounts. =Children's premiums= Kellogg's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book. The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase two packages of the cereal. But in 1909, Kelloggs changed the book give-away to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime. Over 2.5 million copies of the book were distributed in different editions over a period of 23 years. At the beginning of the Second World War, radio was a big player in the promotion and distribution of premiums, usually toys that were closely related to the radio program. There were many radio shows that offered premiums to their listeners, but Captain Midnight was one of the best known. The early sponsor of Captain Midnight was Skelly Oil, and parents could get forms to mail-in for radio premiums at the gas stations. Later, Ovaltine became the sponsor of Captain Midnight, and it continued the premiums through advertising on the labels and foil tops of Ovaltine that could be collected to exchange for Captain Midnight premiums and offering membership to the \\"Secret Squadron\\". =Premiums hit home= Betty Crocker products, owned by General Mills, had one of the best-known premium programs when the company started inserting coupons in bags of flour in 1929 which consumers could collect and use to purchase Oneida flatware at a reduced price. In 1932, the popular coupon program was improved so that consumers could redeem coupons for an entire set of flatware ‚Äî the pattern was called \\"Friendship\\". Beginning in 1937, the coupons were printed on the outside of the box with point values and could be redeemed through the Betty Crocker Catalog in exchange for cookbooks, kitchenwares, and home accessories, as the box tops stated, for 25 to 75 percent savings.Fred Reichheld (1996) The Loyalty Effect, Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 1996. To avoid confusion with cents-off coupons, the premium program was renamed \\"Betty Crocker Catalog Points\\" in 1992.General Mills: 75 Years of Innovation, Invention, Food and Fun General Mills retired the Betty Crocker Catalog in December 2006 and ended the premium program after 75 years. (Now that the premium program is no longer in effect, consumers can clip \\"Box Tops for Education\\" that are printed on Betty Crocker products to help schools pay for educational supplies.)  Premiums in the 21st century  Premiums have come a long way since the 19th century and although they are rarely referred to as ‚Äúpremium campaigns‚Äù, the concept itself is still very much relevant to today's marketing professionals. Let's look at New World's Little Shopper promotion implemented by Foodstaffs in 201. The promotion called for customers to spend a minimum of $40 in store, in order to receive one of 44 free mini grocery items. The grocery items were identical, miniature replicas of actual products found within the supermarket. The brands of the products in which were represented in the campaign had paid Foodstaffs to be included.Stop Press NZ. (2013, 12 3). Little Shop of dollars: New World celebrates the success of its tiny promotion. Retrieved from Stop Press NZ: http://stoppress.co.nz/news/little-shop-dollars-new-world-celebrates-success- its-tiny-promotion In taking this approach, Foodstaffs created an opportunity for its suppliers to also take advantage of brand encounters targeting consumers who may not have necessarily been aware of their products. The use of persuasive communication techniques, i.e., television and radio advertisements created positive attitude changes amongst shoppers who may not have necessarily been loyal to a particular supermarket, aiding the company to expand their consumer reach and market share. The Little Shopper promotion also created a buzz amongst the younger generations with reports of parents succumbing to the ‚Äòpester-powers‚Äô of their child's fear of missing out.Edwards, J. (2015, 8 28). How the collectables craze is turning children into brand-savvy shoppers. Retrieved from Stuff.co.nz: http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/better-business/71450282/how-the-collectables- craze-is-turning-children-into-brandsavvy-shopper The return on investment for the Little Shoppers ‚Äòpremiums‚Äô campaign was as much tangible as it was financial. It also left a lasting impression on consumers even after the campaign had closed. Media reported on countless social media posts and TradeMe listings from consumers attempting to buy or swap the collectables in order to complete their set. The promotion also led to creative spin-offs with consumers upcycling the miniature products for wearable art competitions, again expanding Foodstaffs consumer reach. The Little Farmers of Kissanpur is another highly successful premium campaign run by the Indian Ketchup brand Kissan. The campaign placed 22nd on the 2015 WARC list of the world's 100 best marketing campaigns. The brands tagline ‚Äòmade with real tomatoes‚Äô was brought to life inside the consumer's home. By redesigning the products packaging to be more effective and of use to the consumer, the company designed a new bottle top. The new bottle top included tomato seeds in which consumers were encouraged to plant in order to grow their own Kissan tomato plant. In addition to providing the means to grow your own plant, Kissan followed up with a competition giving children who grew the best plants the opportunity to feature on the bottles. WARC reported that consumption of the brand grew to over 2.5 times the rate of the category.WARC. (2015). WARC Top 100. Retrieved from WARC: http://www.warc.com/Rankings.100?DataType=Top100Campaign&Year;=2015# Legality Whilst the law in the United States and the United Kingdom governing premiums is relatively lax, it is comparatively stricter in several other countries. Belgium, Germany, and Scandinavia have strict consumer protection laws regulating the use of premiums. In Argentina, Austria, Norway, and Venezuela, the law governing premiums is so strict that they are effectively banned. In Japan, the value of a premium is restricted to being no more than 10% of the value of the product that is purchased in order to obtain it. In Finland, it is illegal to describe a premium as a free gift. In France, premiums may not be made conditional upon the purchase of a third product.

Fafnir and Glaurung soon left the band, but Nagash continued Troll as a solo project, playing guitar and keyboard. Wanting to be in a band and \\"express himself on all levels\\", he founded the band Covenant together with Amund Svensson in 1993.

At the same time, he changed his stage name to Lex Icon in order to reflect the artistic direction The Kovenant had taken. In 2004, now known as Lex Icon, he teamed up with Shagrath and formed a new heavy metal band called Chrome Division. In this band he played drums.

The organization was incorporated in Mauritius with the intention to sponsor, establish and operate the proposed new Top Level Domain (TLD) \\".africa\\". Its main charitable objects are: (a) for the advancement of education in information technology to the African society; and (b) in connection with (a) to provide the African society with a continental Internet domain name to have access to Internet services for the people of Africa as a purpose beneficial to the public in general. DotConnectAfrica also set up an affiliate DCA Registry Services Ltd. in Nairobi, Kenya, which will be running the registry operation. The DCA registry intends to channel surplus resources gained from the .Africa registry operation to sponsor foundations that will cater to various charitable projects including the already launched miss.africa and generation.africa, as well as capacity building for African ccTLDs, with the general objective of improving the African Internet and business landscape. Governance Structure According to the organization website, the governance model is to be adapted from Africa's development policy model augmented with other geo-TLD models. Public Policy consideration will include direct input from African policy makers, including the African Union, Economic Commission for Africa and African Development Bank on policy matters. History Sophia Bekele, director of DotConnectAfrica, has undertaken policy-level work at ICANN. She served as a gNSO Council member from 2005 to 2007 and participated in the new gTLD policy development process (PDP). Bekele initiated the .africa TLD in 2006 in ICANN and announced during the Paris ICANN International meeting to the stakeholders, her organization will made a bid for the .africa TLD. DCA presented the DotAfrica (.africa) gTLD initiative to several inter- governmental bodies in Africa such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and the African Union Commission (AUC). The UNECA endorsed DotConnectAfrica's application in 2008. The AUC also endorsed the proposal in 2009. Endorsement to DCA In readiness for the important task of applying for a geographic TLD, DCA also presented the DotAfrica (.africa) gTLD initiative to several inter-governmental bodies in Africa such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), and the African Union Commission (AUC) under African Union. The UNECA is the regional economic development body of the United Nations in Africa. It helps the AU in meeting its strategic objectives in the areas of knowledge management and sharing, technical implementation capacity, studies and research; the results of which are disseminated to different African countries to help them in policy formulation, implementation of economic development goals and objectives, and capacity building. DCA then received an endorsement for its DotAfrica (.africa) initiative from the UNECA economic grouping which has all the African countries as its member states. DCA also presented and clarified the DotAfrica (.africa) initiative to the African Union Commission and after working closely with AU officials, received an early endorsement in support of its gTLD proposal in 2009. DCA also received other endorsement from key organizations of global public internet such as Internationalized Domain Resolution Union (IDRU) which deals with global multi-language initiatives, whose members also contributed to ICANN IDN policy process. Yes2dotAfrica Global Campaign After the approvals by the Pan African institutions, DotConnectAfrica then launched and run a 6-year successful \\"Yes2dotAfrica\\" global awareness campaign as an ongoing effort to create awareness of the benefits of a dotAfrica name and do a public outreach. This campaign initiative, also part of DCA's Trust program is meant to give Africa a regional identity and global presence. The Campaign was first launched in East Africa during the 2010 AITEC East Africa ICT Summit held from 7‚Äì8 September 2010 in Nairobi, Kenya. Sophia Bekele, the executive director, DotConnectAfrica made the announcement during the summit in her Keynote speech Since, the Yes2dotafrica campaign has gained recognition and been given credence as a platform for advocacy of the benefits of DotAfrica gTLD and technology transfer and received a very high number of global media coverage In December 2011, DCA reported that over 3600 potential registrants had preregistered with DCA as part of its promotional campaign jointly with United Domain. DCA also said in its application to ICANN that, if granted the right to administer the .africa TLD, DCA would set prices at levels competitive with the popular .com TLD: about $10 for the domains Other trust programs identified by DCA include Miss.africa, Generation.africa and driving the capacity of the African ccTLDs. Registry Services Strategic & Industry Partnerships DotConnectAfrica announced in June 2012 that it had made an agreement with CentralNic, a domain name registrar in the United Kingdom, to provide registry services for the .africa TLD. DCA also reached agreements with Safaricom and Fincom to provide co-location for the hardware necessary to run the .africa registry. AUC interest in .Africa and its participation in the ICANN process After the AUC gave an early endorsement to DotConnectAfrica to establish a .africa registry, the same AUC department, Infrastructure and Energy, which wrote a support letter of support for DCA application, turned around and expressed a new interest to get the TLD for itself. Then, the African Union Commission issued a statement on May 12, 2010, referencing the endorsement letter issued by Chairman Jean Ping to DCA, and stated that they would work with ICANN and other internet stakeholders to go through an open process to determine the implementation of .africa. Nearly a year later, the AUC organized an \\"AU DotAfrica Task Force\\" (members drawn from the African Internet Community, but that did not include DCA members), and issued yet another letter after the prior one to DCA, stating that the AU did not support nor endorse any individual or organization and announced that entities interested must submit their Expression of Interest (EOI), which would served as the commission's basis for endorsement and selection DCA criticized AUC's plan to issue an EOI for an endorsement process, stating AUC's objective for accountability and transparency was \\"hollow and unbelievable,\\" as their EOI fails to acknowledge the previous endorsement issued to DCA by the AUC. Furthermore, DCA pointed out that the EOI process would be biased, as the AU Task Force had already expressed its support for AfTLD during the 2011 annual African ccTLD event in Ghana. Additionally the AU Task force members are the same individuals who have vested interest in the outcome of the .africa as the members are compiled of the individuals that have registered a \\"dotafrica.org\\" domain and have claimed to be the competition for DCA's initiative. During the ICANN 46 International meeting in October 2011 in Dakar Senegal, DCA opposed the reservation of the names .africa, .afrique and .afriqya, suggestions that had been forwarded by the AUC and the AU DotAfrica Task Force, after the ministerial round table that preceded the Senegal ICANN meeting DCA strongly objected to this proposal by voicing its opinion during the ICANN Dakar public forum meeting directly to the ICANN Board as well as in writing to ICANN. DCA stated the addition of these names to ICANN's reserved list would have jeopardized the .Africa applications in the current new gTLD opening from being applied to by any applicant as per ICANN's gTLD guidebookDot Africa soap The reservation of these names to the AUC would have meant that all the applications of the .africa gTLD would have been annulled and there would not be any competition to the .Africa gTLD at the ICANN level, as the names will be reserved for the AUC under a legislative protection for their own use as the AUC is requesting. After a period of time, DCA's requested for a public written response from ICANN on this issue and ICANN responded on March 8, 2012, to the Communiqu√© presented by the AU officials during the Pre-Senegal Ministerial roundtable and eventually the names were not reserved, making DCA victorious on this issue Failing to get the name directly reserved by ICANN in response to the Dakar request, in January 2013, the African Union Commission directly appointed a South African company UniForum to administer the .africa TLD on behalf of Africa. This was contested by DCA as quite misleading giving the reason that a firm cannot be selected to administer a domain that has not yet been delegated. Then the African Union Commission issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) and endorsed the same South African company as a preferred applicant for .africa, stating that it went through an international competitive bid in an open and transparent process. DotConnectAfrica stated the AU RFP to select a Registry was issued shortly after Dakar meeting in December and an award was made in January, an incredibly short period of evaluation time compared to what even ICANN registry selection process for an applicant would take nearly 6 ‚Äì8 months. Additionally, the AU RFP imposed a \\"community application restrictions\\" which is not in line with the ICANN RFP for a gTLD applicant, making it impossible for any serious applicant to legitimately participate in the process, except Uniform that was directly recommended by the Chairman of the AFTLD (African Top Level Domain Name organization) who also runs the South African .ZA authority, as well as whose organization is represented at the AU DotAfrica TaskForce. Therefore, DCA contested that the entire RFP should be null and void as it is illegitimate and the members full of conflict of interest. Thereafter, DCA challenged the AU to fully disclose several issues in the greater interest of global public transparency and accountability\\" and release the details of its (dot)Africa EOI process and the RFP. DCA also submitted this issues to ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee  Application to ICANN  The DotAfrica .africa gTLD application was submitted by DCA Trust during the application window that opened on 12 January 2012 and closed on 22 May 2012. DCA hopes to win the mandate from ICANN for the management of the .africa gTLD to enable it administer this resource on behalf of its Pan-African constituency and other stakeholders around the globe. DCA Trust has made explicit commitment in its .africa application to ICANN that the Trust will establish a full-service Internet registry which will be operated by DCA Registry Services Ltd. in accordance with the technical and operational criteria and other specifications stipulated by ICANN in the new gTLD Applicants' Guidebook. In its response to comments for competitive applicants, DCA wrote its official response to the Evaluators of ICANN that the application for Uniforum should be disqualified as it does not meet the legal, financial and endorsement criteria that followed the ICANN guidebook. Amongst many of its comments, most significantly DCA criticized that Uniforum's application submitted as co- applicant with AU has given the rights of the database and Intellectual property to the AU in a separate contract as such policy is against ICANNs new gTLD requirements, despite the AUC not even being alegal applicant, just to get public support from African governments. Additionally DCA noted that uniforum provided an Understated Registry COI Amount and therefore UniForum does not pass the Financial Evaluation Criteria for the COI, if the actual COI amount provided by UniForum has been deliberately understated and that the amount is grossly insufficient to cater for the necessary user and registrant protection from possible risks of .AFRICA registry failure (or business failure of UniForum ZA Central Registry). DotConnectAfrica's complaint letter to the US congress In February 2013, not getting response to the communication sent to ICANN and the African Union DCA appealed to members of the U.S. Congress in February, 2013. DCA wrote and reiterated their issues with the manner in which UniForum received and carried out the AU's endorsement. DCA notes that it does not feel there are sufficient mechanisms for appeal or dealing with illegalities over the new gTLD program and requested the U.S. Congress to intervene immediately to appoint an independent New gTLD Ombudsman for the entire ICANN New gTLD program, where such grievances will be heard and addressed  Early warnings of objections to DCA's application  On November 20, 2012, the AUC failing to get the .africa string names reserved, they followed the advice given by the ICANN Board in their reply to the AU communiqu√©, that states \\"While ICANN is not able to offer the specific relief requested in the Communiqu√©, the robust protections built into the New gTLD Program afford the African Union (and its individual member states), through the Government Advisory Committee, the opportunity to raise concerns that an applicant is seen as potentially sensitive or problematic, or provide direct advice to the Board. In addition, the African Union (and its individual member states) can avail itself of any of the appropriate objection processes mentioned above in the event an application is received for any string ‚Äì even those beyond representations of .Africa ‚Äì that may raise concern\\" and so filed an \\"early warning\\" objecting to DCA's application for the dotAfrica TLD with ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC). Therefore, the objection by the AUC stated that \\"the application fails to meet the minimum requirements prescribed by ICANN in the gTLD Applicant Guidebook concerning geographic names\\" and that > DCA‚Äôs application constitutes an unwarranted intrusion and interference with > the mandate given to the AUC by African Head of States and African Ministers > responsible for Communication and Information Technologies. In this regard > the AUC has been mandated to establish dotAfrica (.Africa) as a continental > Top-Level Domain for use by organisations, businesses and individuals with > guidance from African Internet Agencies and in doing so to set up the > structures and modalities for the implementation of the dotAfrica (.Africa) > project. DCA‚Äôs persistent interference in this process is likely to have > substantive political, economic and social repercussions in Africa. Identical early warnings of objection were filed with the GAC by the governments of Comoros, Kenya, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Benin, Egypt, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Morocco, Uganda, Senegal, South Africa, Nigeria, and Tanzania.  GAC Objection to DCA's application  Beijing GAC objection: The ICANN meeting in Beijing China set the ground for some of the new gTLD procedures to continue, GAC Advice was part of the communiqu√© that saw several strings receive varying responses to their applications. The results of the GAC advice though attracted wide criticism from the internet fraternity as to how some of the decisions were reached. DotConnectAfrica application received a GAC Objection advice to which they submitted a response following guidelines of the guidebook The New gTLD Program Committee, which is part of the ICANN Board subsequently gave recommendation that the GAC advice be followed, which essential is the Board's advise, DCA critiqued in their reply to GAC. DCA then refused to withdraw, its application before accountability hearing is completed, against the backdrop that the ICANN Board decision was \\"unfair, discriminatory, and lacked appropriate due diligence and care\\" as well as \\"anti-competitive\\" to their application and organizational aspirations.  IRP Process: DCA Vs ICANN  After the objection, DotConnectAfrica refused to back down and contacted the African Union and ICANN. DCA also requested for a Reconsideration which ICANN denied prompting that organization to begin the Independent Review Process. The IRP is a proceeding provided for in Article IV, Section 3 of the ICANN Bylaws, by which any person materially affected by a decision or action of the ICANN Board may request that the action be reviewed by an independent third party for consistency with the ICANN Bylaws and/or Articles of Incorporation and is governed by the International Dispute Resolution Procedures of the ICDR and the Supplementary Procedures for ICANN IRP Process. On March 26, 2014 at the ICANN Singapore meeting ICANN signed a controversial contract with ZACR, despite IRP proceedings with DCA, which received criticisms against such actions by some African public media. =IRP Injunction awarded DotConnectAfrica Trust= On May 12, 2014 DCA won an injunction against ICANN in its IRP Proceedings in an arbitration process. The Injunction ruled that \\"ICANN must immediately refrain from any further processing of any application for .africa until this Panel has heard the merits of DCA‚Äôs Trust Notice of Independent Review Process and issued its final decision regarding the same\\". ICANN had on March 24, 2014 proceeded to sign a contract with ZACR who are competitors for the \\".africa\\" string, sparking an outrage that ICANN was continually mistreating DCA Trust. DCA is represented by an international law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP based in New York while ICANN is represented by a Los Angeles-based Law Firm Jones Day LLC, which has been working with ICANN nearly since its inception =Panel accepts DCA‚Äôs position on procedural framework on DotAfrica IRP= On 14 August 2014, The IRP panel issued a Thirty Three (33) Pages ruling to accept DotConnectAfrica's position on the procedural framework of the IRP proceedings. The Panel has ruled terming its Declaration and the future Declaration on the Merits of the case are binding on ICANN. (ICANN wanted this to be \\"advisory\\" and not \\"binding) =DCA Trust Declared Prevailing Party in IRP Panel‚Äôs Final Declaration = On 9th July 2015, DCA Trust won in the DCA Vs ICANN .Africa IRP. DCA Trust was declared the prevailing party. The ICANN Board on 16 July 2015 called a special meeting consider the independent review panel's declaration that held in favor of DotConnectAfrica Trust , the board resolved that DCA‚Äôs application would be taken back to evaluation. Part of the IRP panel‚Äôs recommendations are as follows: 148 Based on the foregoing, after having carefully reviewed the Parties‚Äô written submissions, listened to the testimony of the three witness, listened to the oral submissions of the Parties in various telephone conference calls and at the in-person hearing of this IRP in Washington, D.C. on 22 and 23 May 2015, and finally after much deliberation, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 11 (c) of ICANN's Bylaws, the Panel declares that both the actions and inactions of the Board with respect to the application of DCA Trust relating to the .AFRICA gTLD were inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of ICANN. 149 Furthermore, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 11 (d) of ICANN's Bylaws, the Panel recommends that ICANN continue to refrain from delegating the .AFRICA gTLD and permit DCA Trust's application to proceed through the remainder of the new gTLD application process. 150 The Panel declares DCA Trust to be the prevailing party in this IRP and further declares that ICANN is to bear, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3, paragraph 18 of the Bylaws, Article 11 of Supplementary Procedures and Article 31 of the ICDR Rules, the totality of the costs of this IRP and the totality of the costs of the IRP Provider The documents of this IRP can be found on DCA's website  DotConnectAfrica Trust Vs ICANN Court Case  =Court Grants DotConnectAfrica's Ex Parte Application for Temporary Restraining Order = DotConnectAfrica Trust took ICANN to Court on January 20, 2016 following a disagreement on how ICANN processed the IRP ruling that was declared DCA Trust the prevailing party on July 9, 2015. DCA Trust submitted its first Amended Notice on 26 February 2016. A United States District Court, Central District Of California - Western Division on March 4, 2016 in a ruling granted an Interim Relief for DotConnectAfrica in a decision [PDF Case No: CV 16-00862 RGK (JCx)] that ICANN should hold off from delegating the .AFRICA top-level domain (TLD) for ZA Central Registry (ZACR. The Court ruling stated: (IN CHAMBERS) Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for TRO (DE [20]) by Judge R. Gary Klausner: The Court grants Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application for TRO. Defendant is enjoined from issuing the .Africa gTLD until the Court decides Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction, scheduled for hearing on April 4, 2016. Upon review of the parties' arguments, the Court finds serious questions going to the merits. Plaintiff has demonstrated that once the gTLD is issued, it will be unable to obtain those rights elsewhere. Moreover, the injury it will suffer cannot be compensated through monetary damages. In opposition, Defendant states in conclusory fashion only that the African governments and the ICANN community will suffer prejudice if the delegation of the gTLD is delayed. The Temporary Restraining Order will allow the Court time to consider arguments from DotConnectAfrica Trust (DCA Trust) and ICANN regarding the .AFRICA TLD. DCA Trust is represented by Brown, Neri, Smith & Khan LLP in the case =Court Grants DotConnectAfrica's Application for Preliminary Injunction, April 12, 2016 = On April 12, 2016, the same court also granted a Preliminary Injunction for DotConnectAfrica, the decision for case no. 16-CV-00862 RGK (JCx) [PDF] The ruling detailed among other things that The balance of equities tips in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. Without preliminary injunction, DCA will lose the opportunity to obtain rights to .Africa because ICANN will likely delegate the rights to ZACR prior to the conclusion of this action, and these rights can be delegated only once. The ruling also shed light on the AUC relationship with ICANN stating that public interest favors granting preliminary injunction, that The AUC's relationship with ZACR, and its interest in preventing the delay of issuing rights to .Africa creates a conflict of interest. Therefore, on this point, the Court accords little weight to the Yedaly Declaration. On balance, the Court finds it more prejudicial to the African community, and the international community in general, if the delegation of .Africa is made prior to a determination on the fairness of the process by which it was delegated.

A number of theories attempt to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia, including the dopamine hypothesis and the glutamate hypothesis. These theories are separate from the causes of schizophrenia, which deal with the factors that lead to schizophrenia. The current theories attempt to explain how changes in brain functioning can contribute to symptoms of the disease.  Pathophysiology  The exact pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains poorly understood. The most commonly supported theories are the dopamine hypothesis and the glutamate hypothesis. Other theories include the specific dysfunction of interneurons, abnormalities in the immune system, abnormalities in myelination and oxidative stress. = Dopamine dysfunction = The first formulations of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia came from post-mortem studies finding increased striatal availability of D2/D3 receptors in the striatum, as well as studies finding elevated CSF levels of dopamine metabolites. Subsequently, most antipsychotics were found to have affinity for D2 receptors. More modern investigations of the hypothesis suggest a link between striatal dopamine synthesis and positive symptoms, as well as increased and decreased dopamine transmission in subcortical and cortical regions respectively. A meta analysis of molecular imaging studies observed increased presynaptic indicators of dopamine function, but no difference in the availability of dopamine transporters or dopamine D2/D3 receptors. Both studies using radio labeled L-DOPA, an indicator of dopamine synthesis, and studies using amphetamine release challenges observed significant differences between those with schizophrenia and control. These findings were interpreted as increased synthesis of dopamine, and increased release of dopamine respectively. These findings were localized to the striatum, and were noted to be limited by the quality of studies used. A large degree of inconsistency has been observed in D2/D3 receptor binding, although a small but nonsignificant reduction in thalamic availability has been found. The inconsistent findings with respect to receptor expression has been emphasized as not precluding dysfunction in dopamine receptors, as many factors such as regional heterogeneity and medication status may lead to variable findings. When combined with findings in presynaptic dopamine function, most evidence suggests dysregulation of dopamine in schizophrenia. Exactly how dopamine dysregulation can contribute to schizophrenia symptoms remains unclear. Some studies have suggested that disruption of the auditory thalamocortical projections give rise to hallucinations, while dysregulated corticostriatal circuitry and reward circuitry in the form of aberrant salience can give rise to delusions. Decreased inhibitory dopamine signals in the thalamus have been hypothesized to result in reduced sensory gating, and excessive activity in excitatory inputs into the cortex. One hypothesis linking delusions in schizophrenia to dopamine suggests that unstable representation of expectations in prefrontal neurons occurs in psychotic states due to insufficient D1 and NMDA receptor stimulation. This, when combined with hyperactivity of expectations to modification by salient stimuli is thought to lead to improper formation of beliefs. = Glutamate abnormalities = Beside the dopamine hypothesis, interest has also focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and the reduced function of the NMDA glutamate receptor in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This has largely been suggested by lower levels of glutamate receptors found in postmortem brains of people previously diagnosed with schizophrenia and the discovery that glutamate blocking drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition. The fact that reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring frontal lobe and hippocampal function and that glutamate can affect dopamine function, all of which have been implicated in schizophrenia, have suggested an important mediating (and possibly causal) role of glutamate pathways in schizophrenia. Positive symptoms fail however to respond to glutamatergic medication. Reduced mRNA and protein expression of several NMDA receptor subunits has also been reported in postmortem brains from people with schizophrenia. In particular, the expression of mRNA for the NR1 receptor subunit, as well as the protein itself is reduced in the prefrontal cortex in post-mortem studies of those with schizophrenia. Fewer studies have examined other subunits, and results have been equivocal, except for a reduction in prefrontal NRC2. The large genome-wide association study mentioned above has supported glutamate abnormalities for schizophrenia, reporting several mutations in genes related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as GRIN2A, GRIA1, SRR, and GRM3. = Interneuron dysfunction = Another hypothesis concerning the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, closely relates to the glutamate hypothesis, and involves dysfunction of interneurons in the brain. Interneurons in the brain are inhibitory GABAergic and local, and function mainly through the inhibition of other cells. One type of interneuron, the fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive interneuron, has been suggested to play a key role in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Early studies have identified decreases in GAD67 mRNA and protein in post-mortem brains from those with schizophrenia compared to controls. These reductions were found in only a subset of cortical interneurons. Furthermore, GAD67 mRNA was completely undetectable in a subset of interneurons also expressing parvalbumin. Levels of parvalbumin protein and mRNA were also found to be lower in various regions in the brain. Actual numbers of parvalbumin interneurons have been found to be unchanged in these studies, however, except for a single study showing a decrease in parvalbumin interneurons in the hippocampus. Finally, excitatory synapse density is lower selectively on parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia and predicts the activity-dependent down-regulation of parvalbumin and GAD67. Together, this suggests that parvalbumin interneurons are somehow specifically affected in the disease. Several studies have tried to assess levels in GABA in vivo in those with schizophrenia, but these findings have remained inconclusive. EEG studies have indirectly also pointed to interneuron dysfunction in schizophrenia (see below). These studies have pointed to abnormalities in oscillatory activity in schizophrenia, particularly in the gamma band (30‚Äì80 Hz). Gamma band activity appears to originate from intact functioning parvalbumin-positive interneuron. Together with the post-mortem findings, these EEG abnormalities point to a role for dysfunctional parvalbumin interneurons in schizophrenia. The largest meta-analysis on copy-number variations (CNVs), structural abnormalities in the form of genetic deletions or duplications, to date for schizophrenia, published in 2015, was the first genetic evidence for the broad involvement of GABAergic neurotransmission. = Myelination abnormalities = Another hypothesis states that abnormalities in myelination are a core pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This theory originated from structural imaging studies, which found that white matter regions, in addition to grey matter regions, showed volumetric reductions in people with schizophrenia. In addition, gene expression studies have shown abnormalities in myelination and oligodendrocytes in the post-mortem brains. Furthermore, oligodendrocyte numbers appear to be reduced in several post- mortem studies. It has been suggested that myelination abnormalities could originate from impaired maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, as these have been found to be intact in schizophrenia brains. = Immune system abnormalities = Another hypothesis postulates that inflammation and immune system abnormalities could play a central role in the disease. The immune hypothesis is supported by findings of high levels of immune markers in the blood of people with schizophrenia. High levels of immune markers have also been associated with having more severe psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies discovered that 129 out of 136 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) significantly associated with schizophrenia were located in the major histocompatibility complex region of the genome. A systematic review investigating neuroinflammatory markers in post-mortem schizophrenia brains has shown quite some variability, with some studies showing alterations in various markers but others failing to find any differences. = Oxidative stress= Another theory that has gained support is that a large role is played in the disease by oxidative stress. Redox dysregulation in early development can potentially influence development of different cell types that have been shown to be impaired in the disease. Oxidative stress has also been indicated through genetic studies into schizophrenia. Oxidative stress has been shown to affect maturation of oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell types in the brain, potentially underlying the white matter abnormalities found in the brain (see below). Furthermore, oxidative stress could also influence the development of GABAergic interneurons, which have also been found to be dysregulated in schizophrenia (see above). Evidence that oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage are increased in various tissues of people with schizophrenia has been reviewed by Markkanen et al. The presence of increased oxidative DNA damage may be due, in part, to insufficient repair of such damages. Several studies have linked polymorphisms in DNA repair genes to the development of schizophrenia. In particular, the base excision repair protein XRCC1 has been implicated. =Neuropathology= The most consistent finding in post-mortem examinations of brain tissue is a lack of neurodegenerative lesions or gliosis. Abnormal neuronal organization and orientation (dysplasia) has been observed in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and subcortical white matter, although results are not entirely consistent. A more consistent cytoarchitectural finding is reduced volume of purkinje cells and pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. This is consistent with the observation of decreased presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus, and a reduction in dendritic spines in the prefrontal cortex. The reductions in prefrontal and increase in striatal spine densities seem to be independent of antipsychotic drug use. =Sleep disorders= It has been suggested that sleep problems may be a core component of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.  Structural abnormalities  Beside theories concerning the functional mechanism underlying the disease, structural findings have been identified as well using a wide range of imaging techniques. Studies have tended to show various subtle average differences in the volume of certain areas of brain structure between people with and without diagnoses of schizophrenia, although it has become increasingly clear that no single pathological neuropsychological or structural neuroanatomic profile exists. = Morphometry = Structural imaging studies have consistently reported differences in the size and structure of certain brain areas in schizophrenia. The largest combined neuroimaging study with over 2000 subjects and 2500 controls has replicated these previous findings. Volumetric increases were found in the lateral ventricles (+18%), caudate nucleus and pallidum, and extensive decreases in the hippocampus (-4%), thalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. Together, this indicates that extensive changes do occur in the brains of people with schizophrenia. A 2006 meta-analysis of MRI studies found that whole brain and hippocampal volume are reduced and that ventricular volume is increased in those with a first psychotic episode relative to healthy controls. The average volumetric changes in these studies are however close to the limit of detection by MRI methods, so it remains to be determined whether schizophrenia is a neurodegenerative process that begins at about the time of symptom onset, or whether it is better characterised as a neurodevelopmental process that produces abnormal brain volumes at an early age. In first episode psychosis typical antipsychotics like haloperidol were associated with significant reductions in gray matter volume, whereas atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine were not. Studies in non-human primates found gray and white matter reductions for both typical and atypical antipsychotics. Abnormal findings in the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex are found before the first onset of schizophrenia symptoms. These regions are the regions of structural deficits found in schizophrenia and first-episode subjects. Positive symptoms, such as thoughts of being persecuted, were found to be related to the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus region. Negative symptoms were found to be related to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Ventricular and third ventricle enlargement, abnormal functioning of the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, neocortical temporal lobe regions, frontal lobe, prefontal gray matter, orbitofrontal areas, parietal lobs abnormalities and subcortical abnormalities including the cavum septi pellucidi, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, thalamus and cerebellar abnormalities. Such abnormalities usually present in the form of loss of volume. Most schizophrenia studies have found average reduced volume of the left medial temporal lobe and left superior temporal gyrus, and half of studies have revealed deficits in certain areas of the frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and temporal gyrus. However, at variance with some findings in individuals with chronic schizophrenia significant group differences of temporal lobe and amygdala volumes are not shown in first-episode people on average. Finally, MRI studies utilizing modern cortical surface reconstruction techniques have shown widespread reduction in cerebral cortical thickness (i.e., \\"cortical thinning\\") in frontal and temporal regions and somewhat less widespread cortical thinning in occipital and parietal regions in people with schizophrenia, relative to healthy control subjects. Moreover, one study decomposed cortical volume into its constituent parts, cortical surface area and cortical thickness, and reported widespread cortical volume reduction in schizophrenia, mainly driven by cortical thinning, but also reduced cortical surface area in smaller frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortical regions. CT scans of the brains of people with schizophrenia show several pathologies. The brain ventricles are enlarged as compared to normal brains. The ventricles hold cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and enlarged ventricles indicate a loss of brain volume. Additionally, the brains have widened sulci as compared to normal brains, also with increased CSF volumes and reduced brain volume. Using machine learning, two neuroanatomical subtypes of schizophrenia have been described. Subtype 1 shows widespread low grey matter volumes, particularly in the thalamus, nucleus accumbens, medial temporal, medial prefrontal, frontal, and insular cortices. Subtype 2 shows increased volume in the basal ganglia and internal capsule, with otherwise normal brain volume. = White matter = Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows for the investigation of white matter more closely than traditional MRI. Over 300 DTI imaging studies have been published examining white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia. Although quite some variation has been found pertaining to the specific regions affected, the general consensus states a reduced fractional anisotropy in brains from people with schizophrenia versus controls. Importantly, these differences between subjects and controls could potentially be attributed to lifestyle effects, medication effects etc. Other studies have looked at people with first-episode schizophrenia that have never received any medication, so-called medication-naive subjects. These studies, although few in number, also found reduced fractional anisotropy in subject brains compared to control brains. As with earlier findings, abnormalities can be found throughout the brain, although the corpus callosum seemed to be most commonly effected.  Functional abnormalities  During executive function tasks, people with schizophrenia demonstrate decreased activity relative to controls in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex(dlPFC), right anterior cingulate cortex(ACC), and left mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Increased activation was observed in the left ACC and left inferior parietal lobe. During emotional processing tasks, reduced activations have been observed in the Medial prefrontal cortex, ACC, dlPFC and amygdala. A meta analysis of facial emotional processing observed decreased activation in the amygdala, parahippocampus, lentiform nuclei, fusiform gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus, as well as increased activation in the left insula. One meta analysis of functional neuroiamging during acute auditory verbal hallucinations has reported increased activations in areas implicated in language, including the bilateral inferior frontal and post central gyri, as well as the left parietal operculum. Another meta analysis during both visual and auditory verbal hallucinations, replicated the findings in the inferior frontal and postcentral gyri during auditory verbal hallucinations, and also observed hippocampal, superior temporal, insular and medial prefrontal activations. Visual hallucinations were reported to be associated with increased activations in the secondary and associate visual cortices. = PET = PET study suggests that the less the frontal lobes are activated (red) during a working memory task, the greater the increase in abnormal dopamine activity in the striatum (green), thought to be related to the neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia. PET scan findings in people with schizophrenia indicate cerebral blood flow decreases in the left parahippocampal region. PET scans also show a reduced ability to metabolize glucose in the thalamus and frontal cortex. PET scans also show involvement of the medial part of the left temporal lobe and the limbic and frontal systems as suffering from developmental abnormality. PET scans show thought disorders stem from increased flow in the frontal and temporal regions while delusions and hallucinations were associated with reduced flow in the cingulate, left frontal, and temporal areas. PET scans carried out during active auditory hallucinations revealed increased blood flow in both thalami, left hippocampus, right striatum, parahippocampus, orbitofrontal, and cingulate areas. In addition, a decrease in NAA uptake has been reported in the hippocampus and both the grey and white matter of the prefrontal cortex of those with schizophrenia. NAA may be an indicator of neural activity of number of viable neurons. however given methodological limitations and variance it is impossible to use this as a diagnostic method. Decreased prefrontal cortex connectivity has also been observed. DOPA PET studies have confirmed an altered synthesis capacity of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system demonstrating a dopaminergic dysregulation.
