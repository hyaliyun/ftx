Both are commemorated among the Ipswich Martyrs. Alexander Gooch, of Woodbridge, was a weaver who had become a believer in the reformed faith. He refused to admit that the Pope was the supreme head of the Church and refused to receive the Mass. In consequence, he had been obliged to flee from his home in Woodbridge and go into hiding. He was pursued by a Justice named Noone. Alice Driver, born around 1528, was a married woman of Grundisburgh (a village close by Woodbridge) who had grown up as a country girl and had often driven her father's plough before she married Edward Driver of that village. She also came to the attention of Justice Noone, for she had obtained an English Bible and begun to read it. She had come to believe that the Holy Communion as it was administered in the Roman Mass was an idolatrous institution and contrary to the teachings of Christ. Therefore, she had probably ceased to attend church and may have been brought to Noone's attention by the priest of Grundisburgh.  The arrest  Justice Noone went to Grundisburgh with a body of men in search of Alexander Gooch, who was in hiding in Alice Driver's house. Hearing that the justice and his men were coming, Gooch and Driver hid themselves in a haystack, but their pursuers stuck pitchforks into the hay and discovered them. Gooch and Driver were captured and taken to the gaol at Melton, a village adjacent to Woodbridge. They remained there for a time, before being taken to Bury St Edmunds to attend the Assizes held at the feast of St James.  First examination  Alice Driver showed herself to be a person of extraordinary courage and forthright speech. She was brought before Sir Clement Heigham, M.P. for Ipswich and Speaker of the House of Commons, who had been concerned also in the burning at Ipswich of Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield two years previously. Before him, she compared Queen Mary to Jezebel. Sir Clement immediately ordered that her ears should be cut off in punishment, but even that did not appear to subdue her spirits but rather increased her determination, and she was sent back to Melton Gaol.  Alice Driver's examination (extract)  In Ipswich she was taken to the judgement hall to be examined by Dr Spenser, Chancellor of Norwich. The Inquisition proceeded as follows, when Alice Driver smiled as she was brought in: Spenser: \\"Why, woman, dost thou laugh us to scorn?\\" Driver: \\"Whether I do or no, I might well enough, to see what fools ye be.\\" Spenser: \\"Wherefore hast thou been laid in prison?\\" Driver: \\"Wherefore? I think I need not tell you, for ye know it better than I.\\" Spenser (taken aback): \\"No, by my troth woman, I know not why.\\" Driver: \\"Then have ye done much wrong thus to imprison me, and know no cause why; for I know no evil that I have done, I thank God, and I hope there is no man that can accuse me of any notorious fact that I have done, justly.\\" Spenser: \\"What sayest thou to the Blessed Sacrament of the altar? Dost thou believe that it is very flesh and blood after the words be spoken of consecration?\\" Alice Driver stood with her lips deliberately sealed. A priest who stood by told her, 'Answer the Chancellor, woman!\\" Driver:\\"Why, priest, I came not to talk with thee, but I came to talk with thy master, but if thou wilt I shall talk with thee, command thy master to hold his peace.\\" With that the priest put his nose in his cap and spake never a word again. The Chancellor again pressed her for a reply. Driver: \\"Sir, pardon me though I make no answer, for I cannot tell what you mean thereby, for in all my life I never heard nor read of any such Sacrament in all the Scripture.\\" Spenser: \\"Why, what scriptures have you read?\\" Driver: \\"I have, I thank God, read God's Book... the Old and New testament. That same book have I read throughout, yet never could find any such Sacrament there; and for that cause I cannot make answer to that thing I know not. Notwithstanding for all, I will grant you a Sacrament, called the Lord's Supper, and therefore seeing I have granted you a Sacrament, I pray you show me what a Sacrament is.\\" Spenser: \\"It is a sign.\\" Dr Gascoigne, who was standing by, confirmed the same, that it was a sign of a holy thing. Driver: \\"You have said the truth, sir, it is a sign indeed, and I must needs grant it; and therefore seeing it is a sign, it cannot be the thing signified also. Thus far we agree, for I have granted you your own saying.\\"  Alice Driver's last statement  Before her condemnation, her final statement was as follows: > Have you any more to say? God be honoured. You be not able to resist the > Spirit of God in me, a poor woman. I am an honest poor man's daughter, never > brought up in the University, as you have been, but I have driven the plough > before my father many a time (I thank God): yet, notwithstanding, in the > defence of God's truth, and in the cause of my Master Christ, by His grace I > will set my foot against the foot of any of you all, in the maintenance and > defence of the same, and if I had a thousand lives, they should go for > payment thereof.  Execution in Ipswich  The execution began at 7.00a.m. on 4 November 1558 (a fortnight before the death of Bloody Mary), when Alexander Gooch and Alice Driver were taken to the Cornhill, Ipswich, where the stake was set up. Many people were assembled, including a considerable number whose sympathies were with the victims, and who supported them with demonstrations of affection and pity. The two knelt on a broom faggot together to say their prayers, and to sing psalms together, until Richard Smart, one of the two Bailiffs of the Borough, roughly told them to \\"have done\\". Their request to have more time in which to prepare themselves was refused. The Sheriff, Sir Henry Dowell, then commanded that they should be tied to the stake. A heavy chain was fastened around Alice Driver's neck, at which she said, \\"Oh! Here is a goodly neckerchief; blessed be God for it.\\" Then various people came up from the crowd and shook hands with them. This annoyed the Sheriff so much that he ordered them to be arrested, whereupon many others from the crowd ran to the stake to do the same, so that he was obliged to leave them all alone. The broom was then lit, and the execution proceeded.  Sources  *John Foxe, Foxe's Book of Martyrs *N. F.

Health issues Tropical diseases are important issues in Colombia because they are major causes of death. Malaria affects nearly 85% of the national territory, mainly the Pacific ocean coast, the Amazon jungle and eastern savannas, with an estimated of 250,000 cases/year and a mortality rate of 3/100,000.http://web.unab.edu.co/editorialunab/revistas/medunab/pdfs/ed719.pdf The main agent is Plasmodium vivax with 66% of the cases, except on the Pacific coast, where Plasmodium falciparum causes 75% of the cases. Yellow fever and Dengue feverGuia De Atencion Del Dengue are major public health concerns, because of their high epidemic potential, high mortality rate and wide distribution of Aedes aegypti. The Colombian government develops vaccination campaigns against yellow fever on a regular basis. Bothrops atrox is the main cause of death for snakebite in Colombia. Chagas disease is endemic to the Santander Department and nearby areas. Other diseases such as Leishmania, rabies, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and West nile virus are also present in Colombia. Snakebites are a big concern, because of the shortage in antivenom supplies countrywide. Different forms of malnutrition severely affect the population, especially children under five years of age, with moderate to severe rates of malnutrition of 21% and iron deficiency anemia of 23%.UNICEF / Colombia - niños–niñas–adolescentes–infancia–salud–educación–igualdad–protección–derechos–noticias–juegos–tarjetas–regalos–libros–videos–VIH–sida–foros–vacunación–nutrición - conflicto armado - trabajo infantil–violencia–secuestros–calle - lactancia materna - registro civil - explotación sexual–desplazados - minas antipersonal–publicaciones–pdf–convención–mortalidad–micronutrientes–gestación–maltrato - agua y saneamiento–limitaciones (see aguapanela). History In 1514, a swine plague killed a majority of the thousand inhabitants of Darién in modern-day Urabá. In 1550, Cartagena suffered an epidemic of leprosy, which they called \\"elefancia\\". The first graduated medical doctor, Alvaro de Aunón came to New Granada from Seville Spain, in 1597 and stayed for a short time. The first drug-store in Colombia was opened at the same time, in the main square of Bogotá by Pedro Lopez Buiza.Historia medicina colombiana Old map of the New Kingdom of Granada In 1636, Rodrigo Enriquez de Andrade started the first faculty of medicine in the New Granada, at St Bartholomew's College with little success because of the prejudices against the medical career in the Spanish culture, where it was considered vulgar and proper of lower-class people. Most of the medical practice in the country was provided by people without formal education.Historia de la Medicina - Compumedicina The first medical book written in Colombia was \\"Tratado de medicina y modelo de curar en estas partes de Indias\\" () by Pedro Fernandez de Valenzuela (1662). In 1740, don Vicente Tomás Cansino started the medical program at Our Lady of the Rosary University. The medical care at the time was made almost exclusively in the particular homes of the sick people due lo the lack of health institutions. The first hospital in Colombia was San Pedro Hospital, in the capital city Bogotá. The hospital started functioning in 1564, built by bishop Juan de los Barrios. In 1739 the Hospital San Juan de Dios, Bogota was opened,SINTITUL-4 built by fray Pedro Pablo Villamor. In 1877, Anna Galvis Hotz became the first Colombian woman to become a Doctor of Medicine having graduated the University of Bern in Switzerland since women could not attend university in Colombia at the time. In 1925, Paulina Beregoff became the first woman to become a Doctor of Medicine from a Colombian institution, the Russian-American graduated from the University of Cartagena. In 1945, Inés Ochoa Pérez became the first Colombian woman to become a Doctor of Medicine from a Colombian institution having graduated from the National University of Colombia. Health standards in Colombia have improved greatly since the 1980s. A 1993 reform transformed the structure of public health care funding by shifting the burden of subsidy from providers to users. As a result, employees have been obligated to pay into health plans to which employers also contribute. Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 56% in 2004 and 66% in 2005, health disparities persist, with the poor continuing to suffer relatively high mortality rates. The refractive surgery keratomileusis was developed by Ignacio Barraquer in 1964 in Bogotá. On January 10, 1985, Dr. Elkin Lucena performed the first successful In vitro fertilization, that allowed the birth of the first Latin American test tube baby Carolina Mendez. On December 14, 1985 the Dr. Alberto Villegas performed the first heart transplant in Latin America to Antonio Yepes.Historia de la Cirugía. Curso a Distancia On May 20, 1994 Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo received the Prince of Asturias Awards by his technical and scientific research in the development of synthetic malaria vaccine. In 2002 Colombia had 58,761 physicians, 23,950 nurses, and 33,951 dentists; these numbers equated to 1.35 physicians, 0.55 nurses, and 0.78 dentists per 1,000 people, respectively. In 2005 Colombia was reported to have only 1.1 physicians per 1,000 people, as compared with a Latin American average of 1.5.  Status of public health  General government spending on health accounted for 20.5% of total government expenditures and for 84.1% of total health expenditures (private expenditures made up the balance) in 2003. Total expenditures on health constituted 5.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2005. The per capita expenditure on health care in 2005 at an average exchange rate was US$150.Colombia country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (February 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Urban and rural residents experienced significant differences in access to health care. The coverage in the three largest cities—Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali—was almost 95 percent. At the rural level, the best services were delivered by the departments in the coffee-growing areas. At the bottom of the scale—in terms of quality and coverage—were the rural areas in the non-Andean regions as well as the marginal neighborhoods in medium-sized and small cities. Since 2001–2 Colombia has halved its homicide rate, which was more than 60 per 100,000 inhabitants, or 28,837, in 2002, one of the world’s highest homicide rates. In 2006, a total of 17,206 violent deaths were recorded, the lowest figure since 1987. Other than homicide, heart disease is the main cause of premature death, followed by strokes, respiratory diseases, road accidents, and diabetes. Waterborne diseases such as cerebral malaria and leishmaniasis are prevalent in lowland and coastal areas. Child immunization for measles in 2004 as a percentage of children under 12 months of age was 92 percent. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the fifth-leading cause of death in the working-age population. According to Colombia’s National Health Institute data reported in 2003, nearly 240,000 people — mostly women and young people — or 0.6 percent of the population had been infected with the virus since AIDS arrived in Colombia in October 1983. Estimates of the number of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adults and children (0–49 years of age), in 2005 ranged from 160,000 to 310,000. The comparable figure for women (15–49 years of age) was 62,000. The number of AIDS and hepatitis B cases has been rising. In 2005, the estimated HIV adult prevalence rate (15–49 years of age) was 0.6 percent. As of 2006, between 5,200 and 12,000 people had died from AIDS. Services provided by the new Multisectoral National Plan, launched in July 2004, include integrated care for people living with HIV and provision of antiretroviral drugs. Under the plan, about 12,000 people have been receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (approximately 54% of those requiring it).  Law 100 of 1991  The national constitution was reformed in 1991 and with this purpose the general system of social security was reformed with the implementation of Law 100, which widely extended health coverage to the population; the economic resources to finance this reform, however, were insufficient, causing the collapse of many public health institutions and affecting the income of the medical staff.La Ley 100 The law 100 of 1993 is divided into four books: * First book: About Pension regulations. * Second book: About the general system of healthcare * Third book: About Occupational safety and health * Fourth book: About Complementary social services The reform of the Colombian healthcare had three main goals: * The achievement of an antitrust policy, to avoid the statal health monopoly. * The incorporation of private health providers into the healthcare market * The creation of a subsidiated healthcare sector covering the poorest population. The general principles of the law determine that healthcare is a public service that must be granted under conditions of proficiency, universality, social solidarity and participation. Article 153 of the law mandates that health insurance be compulsory, that health providers must have administrative autonomy, and that health users must have free choice of health providers.

Ley 142 de 1994 (julio 11), artículo 102. All mayors should do the stratification of residential properties of their municipality or district. Most of the social subsidies and public health programs are focused in strata 1 and 2 (and the newly introduced stratum 0 http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1757051). The fraudulent expedition of low level SISBEN ID cards is currently one of the major problems in the healthcare system. Regional politicians are often accused of providing them in exchange for votes to people that are not genuinely in need. Wrong identification of beneficiaries and political issues present a challenge to the system which is preventing people in need from receiving the subsidies and benefits designed for them.  EPS  The National Health Superintendent (Superintendencia de Salud) defines which organizations may qualify as EPS according to a number or requirements, including infrastructure, capital, number of users, functionality and covering. The function of the EPS is to sell health service packages to the public, and contract such services with the healthcare-providing institution. Some EPS providers offer a \\"Plan Complementario\\" that offers more expanded coverage and priority service to the patient.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX-Z9swtTyA Most EPS providers also offer \\"Medicina Prepagada\\" that offers the highest level of medical attention and priority service to the patient at much higher costs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qyw0qoWXCU  Health professionals and the healthcare system  As of October 1, 2014, there were 3,620 health establishments in Colombia, including hospitals, clinics and ambulance services.

Although this new system has widened population coverage by the social and health security system from 21% (pre-1993) to 96% in 2012, health disparities persist.

The Berks-Lehigh Regional Police was a multi-jurisdictional police department in southeastern Pennsylvania. The agency provided law enforcement services to four incorporated municipalities in Berks and Lehigh counties. In Berks County, the department served Topton Borough, Lyons Borough and Maxatawny Township. In Lehigh County, the Township of Upper Macungie was served by the agency. Through the formation of a \\"police district\\" under the control of a Police Commission, some municipalities in Pennsylvania have found that improved and more professional police services could be obtained through inter-governmental cooperation. Having one police department covering four neighboring communities, rather than four separate police departments, allows each municipality to enjoy the benefits of a larger department, such as specialized units and a professional staff. Prior to January 1, 2001, the department was known as the Northeastern Berks Regional Police, as it only covered the three Berks County municipalities. The agency by this name existed between 1991–2001. When neighboring Upper Macungie Township in Lehigh County joined the agency in 2001, the name was changed to Berks-Lehigh Regional Police. On April 16, 2012, the Berks-Lehigh Regional Police announced it was disbanding at the end of 2012, with Upper Macungie Township forming its own police force. On December 28, 2012, it was announced Maxatawny Township would form its own police department. The new department would be led by one officer for the time being who would be in charge of ordinance enforcement and traffic studies, with the Pennsylvania State Police handling emergency calls and arrests in the township. A full scale police department may be created in the future. In a primary ballot in May, residents voted against establishing a police department with a 2 mil tax increase.

Early years Shaggy Flores, was born and raised in Spanish Harlem, New York City, as well as in Puerto Rico and Springfield, Massachusetts. He received his primary and secondary education in Puerto Rico and Massachusetts. As a child, growing up in Robinson Gardens Housing Projects, he was heavily exposed to the work of the early Nuyorican poets, his mother being a poet herself. Later in junior high and high school he showed a proficiency for writing and for creating short stories that depicted the Puerto Rican experience. He graduated from the High School of Commerce and eventually met a recruiter for the University of Massachusetts Amherst (BCP Program) who helped him continue his studies. During the early nineties, he was heavily involved with student politics at the University of Massachusetts, resurrecting old student organizations and creating new ones in the process. It was during this period that his work as a Nuyorican poet became known and he began to find elder Nuyorican poets who could serve as mentors. He completed his education at the University of Massachusetts with a degree in the African Diaspora. He also, along with student organizers from La Causa of Amherst College, created the annual Voices for the Voiceless poetry concert, which takes place every December at Amherst College. Voices is one of the largest Diaspora poetry concerts in the Northeast, bringing nationally established ALANA and LGBTQ writers to the five-college community for one night of poetry. It was at this event that he established the Louis Reyes Rivera lifetime achievement award to honor legendary artists. Early Debut Shaggy Flores made his early poetry debut by performing his work at the first North East Latino Student Conference at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, in the early nineties then later for a series of events produced by the Puerto Rican Student organization. He was a member of the Umass poetry society and traveled frequently to New York to perform at events such as the annual Muévete Conference held at Hostos Community College and later at the National Poetry Slam held in Providence, RI. Early readings would include performances at the Nuyorican Poets Café, Columbia University, Smith College, Mt. Holyoke College, Springfield College, the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and for a poetry troupe created by Louis Reyes Rivera and Felipe Luciano call the Wordquestra in New York City. He would later get to meet and perform with many of the early Nuyorican writers who inspired him to become a writer. His poems and interview have been published in journals, books, websites, and anthologies.

The film, conceived and co-produced by Don Boyd, was one of the most expensive box office bombs in history, losing its British backers Thorn- EMI anywhere from $11–22 million and profoundly affecting its fortunes and aspirations. Plot In a small Florida tourist town named Ticlaw, the Mayor/Preacher Kirby T. Calo (William Devane) also operates a hotel and tiny wildlife safari park. The town's major draw is a water-skiing elephant named Bubbles. When the state highway commission builds a freeway adjacent to the town, Calo slips an official $10,000 to assure an off ramp. The ramp doesn't come, so the townsfolk literally paint the town pink to attract visitors. Meanwhile, tourists from various parts of the United States, shown in a series of concurrent, ongoing vignettes, are heading to Florida and will all end up in Ticlaw, one way or another. They include a pair of bank robbers from New York (George Dzundza, Joe Grifasi) who pick up a cocaine-dealing hitchhiker (Daniel Stern); a Chicago copy machine repairman and aspiring children's book author (Beau Bridges), who picks up a waitress (Beverly D'Angelo), who is carrying her deceased mother's ashes to Florida; a dentist and his dysfunctional family (Howard Hesseman, Teri Garr, Peter Billingsley, and Jenn Thompson), vacationing cross-country in their RV; an elderly woman (Jessica Tandy) with a drinking problem and her loving husband (Hume Cronyn), who are heading to Florida to retire; two nuns (mother superior Geraldine Page, novice nun Deborah Rush); and a wannabe country songwriter (Paul Jabara) hauling a playful rhino and other wild animals to Ticlaw.

The two of them toured the US for nine months, researching and writing the script. Boyd returned to London, showed the script to Barry Spikings of EMI films who agreed to finance.AT THE MOVIES; THE MAN BEHIND BAD TIMING New York Times 19 Sep 1980: C.6.

Schlesinger later said \\"some of the charm comes from Clinton’s naivete, which was one of my original attractions to the script. Clinton’s writing is fresh and completely original. He is highly imaginative. It is not a smug or knowing film at all. In fact, it’s very charming. It’s also quite intelligent.\\" The director added, \\"If we had really wanted to make it totally surefire commercial, we would have hired six gag writers and I wouldn't have directed it. It would have been a series of gags, which is what the public seems to be oriented to...) I wanted to do an affectionate comedy that had a dark side, and yet had moments when you could be absolutely serious... The only way to make it work, as far as I was concerned, was to go for whatever truth you could find in it...to give whatever human thrust dramatically to each of those characters that I could.\\" Schlesinger called it \\"the most complicated project I've ever attempted\\" adding that the film was \\"a comedy about characters, so it needs extremely fine care and acting. This is what appealed to me, because I’m mainly intrigued with the people in my films rather than with the plot. This is a comedy about people living on the brink, and that’s the way most people actually live, I think. Many scenes often have something else happening in the same frame, so the timing becomes extremely important. If some incident is a bit off, the sequence just won’t work. You use less close-ups in a movie of this kind, so you need to stand back a little and see it all happening – how two people are relating to one another while some other action is going on. So often, with these things in consideration, more takes are required.\\" Schlesinger later said when he came on board they did \\"four or five\\" extra drafts. \\"I changed a lot about the town and the thrust of the town: I also tried to give a film with this many characters as much development as I could.

IT'S A REAL BLOWUP Taylor, Clarke. Los Angeles Times 20 July 1980: p32. This movie was filmed in the small central Florida town of Mount Dora. The off-ramp filming took place at the I-75 and Palmer Road overpass in Sarasota, Florida. Most of the highway scenes take place on I-75 between Sarasota and Ft. Myers while the highway was still under construction. Dynamite crews blew up a wooden bridge built to look like the southbound lane overpass at I-75 and Palmer Road before the Tampa-to-Miami leg of the highway was completed in 1981. Many portions of Fruitville, Florida were painted pink to match the sets in Mount Dora and remained pink for decades afterward. Palmer Road never was designated for an I-75 exit because it is not a main thoroughfare. The exit for Fruitville is about two miles north of the filming location. Part of the film was also shot in Salt Lake City, Utah and New York City. The final scene cost $1 million. While the film was in post production, Boyd said \\"on the strength of a film that hasn't been released yet and which nobody knows will be a success or a flop, Ed Clinton and I are being buried in movie offers.\\" Release The film was going to be released by American Film Distribution, but that company folded in February 1981 and it went to Universal.UNIVERSAL TO MARKET FILMS FROM A.F.D.

Reception =Critical response= The film received negative reviews upon release, and was pulled from theatres after just one week. Variety wrote: \\"The overriding question about EMI's Honky Tonk Freeway is why anyone should want to spend over $25m. on a film as devoid of any basic humorous appeal...[Its] long-term commercial appeal appears to be almost nil.\\" Some have argued that the film can be viewed as a satire on the American way of life, and this contributed to its unfavorable critical reception at the time. \\"I thought it was the funniest movie I'd ever made,\\" said Schlesinger shortly after the reviews came out. \\"I'm surprised at the hostility...I think it's been misperceived. The (critical) tone is 'how dare he? These characters are all monsters.' I'm amazed they find it misanthropic.

Electronic power conditioning and control of the production and distribution of electricity are important aspects of the smart grid. Smart grid policy is organized in Europe as Smart Grid European Technology Platform. Policy in the United States is described in § 17381. Roll-out of smart grid technology also implies a fundamental re-engineering of the electricity services industry, although typical usage of the term is focused on the technical infrastructure. Background = Historical development of the electricity grid = The first alternating current power grid system was installed in 1886 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. At that time, the grid was a centralized unidirectional system of electric power transmission, electricity distribution, and demand-driven control. In the 20th century local grids grew over time, and were eventually interconnected for economic and reliability reasons. By the 1960s, the electric grids of developed countries had become very large, mature and highly interconnected, with thousands of 'central' generation power stations delivering power to major load centres via high capacity power lines which were then branched and divided to provide power to smaller industrial and domestic users over the entire supply area. The topology of the 1960s grid was a result of the strong economies of scale: large coal-, gas- and oil-fired power stations in the 1 GW (1000 MW) to 3 GW scale are still found to be cost-effective, due to efficiency-boosting features that can be cost effective only when the stations become very large. Power stations were located strategically to be close to fossil fuel reserves (either the mines or wells themselves, or else close to rail, road or port supply lines). Siting of hydro-electric dams in mountain areas also strongly influenced the structure of the emerging grid. Nuclear power plants were sited for availability of cooling water. Finally, fossil fuel-fired power stations were initially very polluting and were sited as far as economically possible from population centres once electricity distribution networks permitted it. By the late 1960s, the electricity grid reached the overwhelming majority of the population of developed countries, with only outlying regional areas remaining 'off-grid'. Metering of electricity consumption was necessary on a per-user basis in order to allow appropriate billing according to the (highly variable) level of consumption of different users. Because of limited data collection and processing capability during the period of growth of the grid, fixed-tariff arrangements were commonly put in place, as well as dual-tariff arrangements where night-time power was charged at a lower rate than daytime power. The motivation for dual-tariff arrangements was the lower night-time demand. Dual tariffs made possible the use of low-cost night-time electrical power in applications such as the maintaining of 'heat banks' which served to 'smooth out' the daily demand, and reduce the number of turbines that needed to be turned off overnight, thereby improving the utilisation and profitability of the generation and transmission facilities. The metering capabilities of the 1960s grid meant technological limitations on the degree to which price signals could be propagated through the system. From 1970s to the 1990s, growing demand led to increasing numbers of power stations. In some areas, supply of electricity, especially at peak times, could not keep up with this demand, resulting in poor power quality including blackouts, power cuts, and brownouts. Increasingly, electricity was depended on for industry, heating, communication, lighting, and entertainment, and consumers demanded ever higher levels of reliability. Towards the end of the 20th century, electricity demand patterns were established: domestic heating and air- conditioning led to daily peaks in demand that were met by an array of 'peaking power generators' that would only be turned on for short periods each day. The relatively low utilisation of these peaking generators (commonly, gas turbines were used due to their relatively lower capital cost and faster start-up times), together with the necessary redundancy in the electricity grid, resulted in high costs to the electricity companies, which were passed on in the form of increased tariffs. In the 21st century, some developing countries like China, India, and Brazil were seen as pioneers of smart grid deployment. =Modernization opportunities= Since the early 21st century, opportunities to take advantage of improvements in electronic communication technology to resolve the limitations and costs of the electrical grid have become apparent. Technological limitations on metering no longer force peak power prices to be averaged out and passed on to all consumers equally. In parallel, growing concerns over environmental damage from fossil-fired power stations has led to a desire to use large amounts of renewable energy. Dominant forms such as wind power and solar power are highly variable, and so the need for more sophisticated control systems became apparent, to facilitate the connection of sources to the otherwise highly controllable grid. Power from photovoltaic cells (and to a lesser extent wind turbines) has also, significantly, called into question the imperative for large, centralised power stations. The rapidly falling costs point to a major change from the centralised grid topology to one that is highly distributed, with power being both generated and consumed right at the limits of the grid. Finally, growing concern over terrorist attack in some countries has led to calls for a more robust energy grid that is less dependent on centralised power stations that were perceived to be potential attack targets. =Definition of \\"smart grid\\"= The first official definition of Smart Grid was provided by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA-2007), which was approved by the US Congress in January 2007, and signed to law by President George W. Bush in December 2007. Title XIII of this bill provides a description, with ten characteristics, that can be considered a definition for Smart Grid, as follows: > \\"It is the policy of the United States to support the modernization of the > Nation's electricity transmission and distribution system to maintain a > reliable and secure electricity infrastructure that can meet future demand > growth and to achieve each of the following, which together characterize a > Smart Grid: (1) Increased use of digital information and controls technology > to improve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid. (2) > Dynamic optimization of grid operations and resources, with full cyber- > security. (3) Deployment and integration of distributed resources and > generation, including renewable resources. (4) Development and incorporation > of demand response, demand-side resources, and energy-efficiency resources. > (5) Deployment of 'smart' technologies (real-time, automated, interactive > technologies that optimize the physical operation of appliances and consumer > devices) for metering, communications concerning grid operations and status, > and distribution automation. (6) Integration of 'smart' appliances and > consumer devices.

(9) Development of > standards for communication and interoperability of appliances and equipment > connected to the electric grid, including the infrastructure serving the > grid. (10) Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary > barriers to adoption of smart grid technologies, practices, and services.\\" The European Union Commission Task Force for Smart Grids also provides smart grid definition as: \\"A Smart Grid is an electricity network that can cost efficiently integrate the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it – generators, consumers and those that do both – in order to ensure economically efficient, sustainable power system with low losses and high levels of quality and security of supply and safety. A smart grid employs innovative products and services together with intelligent monitoring, control, communication, and self-healing technologies in order to: # • Better facilitate the connection and operation of generators of all sizes and technologies. # • Allow consumers to play a part in optimising the operation of the system. # • Provide consumers with greater information and options for how they use their supply. # • Significantly reduce the environmental impact of the whole electricity supply system. # • Maintain or even improve the existing high levels of system reliability, quality and security of supply. # • Maintain and improve the existing services efficiently.\\" A common element to most definitions is the application of digital processing and communications to the power grid, making data flow and information management central to the smart grid. Various capabilities result from the deeply integrated use of digital technology with power grids. Integration of the new grid information is one of the key issues in the design of smart grids. Electric utilities now find themselves making three classes of transformations: improvement of infrastructure, called the strong grid in China; addition of the digital layer, which is the essence of the smart grid; and business process transformation, necessary to capitalize on the investments in smart technology. Much of the work that has been going on in electric grid modernization, especially substation and distribution automation, is now included in the general concept of the smart grid. =Early technological innovations= Smart grid technologies emerged from earlier attempts at using electronic control, metering, and monitoring. In the 1980s, automatic meter reading was used for monitoring loads from large customers, and evolved into the Advanced Metering Infrastructure of the 1990s, whose meters could store how electricity was used at different times of the day. Smart meters add continuous communications so that monitoring can be done in real time, and can be used as a gateway to demand response-aware devices and \\"smart sockets\\" in the home. Early forms of such demand side management technologies were dynamic demand aware devices that passively sensed the load on the grid by monitoring changes in the power supply frequency. Devices such as industrial and domestic air conditioners, refrigerators and heaters adjusted their duty cycle to avoid activation during times the grid was suffering a peak condition. Beginning in 2000, Italy's Telegestore Project was the first to network large numbers (27 million) of homes using smart meters connected via low bandwidth power line communication. Some experiments used the term broadband over power lines (BPL), while others used wireless technologies such as mesh networking promoted for more reliable connections to disparate devices in the home as well as supporting metering of other utilities such as gas and water. Monitoring and synchronization of wide area networks were revolutionized in the early 1990s when the Bonneville Power Administration expanded its smart grid research with prototype sensors that are capable of very rapid analysis of anomalies in electricity quality over very large geographic areas. The culmination of this work was the first operational Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) in 2000. Other countries are rapidly integrating this technology — China started having a comprehensive national WAMS when the past 5-year economic plan completed in 2012. The earliest deployments of smart grids include the Italian system Telegestore (2005), the mesh network of Austin, Texas (since 2003), and the smart grid in Boulder, Colorado (2008). See Deployments and attempted deployments below. Features of the smart grid The smart grid represents the full suite of current and proposed responses to the challenges of electricity supply. Because of the diverse range of factors there are numerous competing taxonomies and no agreement on a universal definition. Nevertheless, one possible categorization is given here. = Reliability = The smart grid makes use of technologies such as state estimation,Yih-Fang Huang; Werner, S.; Jing Huang; Kashyap, N.; Gupta, V., \\"State Estimation in Electric Power Grids: Meeting New Challenges Presented by the Requirements of the Future Grid,\\" Signal Processing Magazine, IEEE , vol.29, no.5, pp.33,43, Sept. 2012 that improve fault detection and allow self-healing of the network without the intervention of technicians. This will ensure more reliable supply of electricity, and reduced vulnerability to natural disasters or attack. Although multiple routes are touted as a feature of the smart grid, the old grid also featured multiple routes. Initial power lines in the grid were built using a radial model, later connectivity was guaranteed via multiple routes, referred to as a network structure. However, this created a new problem: if the current flow or related effects across the network exceed the limits of any particular network element, it could fail, and the current would be shunted to other network elements, which eventually may fail also, causing a domino effect. See power outage. A technique to prevent this is load shedding by rolling blackout or voltage reduction (brownout). = Flexibility in network topology = Next-generation transmission and distribution infrastructure will be better able to handle possible bidirectional energy flows, allowing for distributed generation such as from photovoltaic panels on building roofs, but also charging to/from the batteries of electric cars, wind turbines, pumped hydroelectric power, the use of fuel cells, and other sources. Classic grids were designed for one-way flow of electricity, but if a local sub-network generates more power than it is consuming, the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability issues.Tomoiagă, B.; Chindriş, M.; Sumper, A.; Sudria-Andreu, A.; Villafafila-Robles, R. Pareto Optimal Reconfiguration of Power Distribution Systems Using a Genetic Algorithm Based on NSGA-II. Energies 2013, 6, 1439-1455. A smart grid aims to manage these situations. = Efficiency = Numerous contributions to overall improvement of the efficiency of energy infrastructure are anticipated from the deployment of smart grid technology, in particular including demand-side management, for example turning off air conditioners during short-term spikes in electricity price, reducing the voltage when possible on distribution lines through Voltage/VAR Optimization (VVO), eliminating truck-rolls for meter reading, and reducing truck-rolls by improved outage management using data from Advanced Metering Infrastructure systems. The overall effect is less redundancy in transmission and distribution lines, and greater utilization of generators, leading to lower power prices. Load adjustment/Load balancing The total load connected to the power grid can vary significantly over time. Although the total load is the sum of many individual choices of the clients, the overall load is not necessarily stable or slow varying. For example, if a popular television program starts, millions of televisions will start to draw current instantly. Traditionally, to respond to a rapid increase in power consumption, faster than the start-up time of a large generator, some spare generators are put on a dissipative standby mode. A smart grid may warn all individual television sets, or another larger customer, to reduce the load temporarily (to allow time to start up a larger generator) or continuously (in the case of limited resources). Using mathematical prediction algorithms it is possible to predict how many standby generators need to be used, to reach a certain failure rate. In the traditional grid, the failure rate can only be reduced at the cost of more standby generators. In a smart grid, the load reduction by even a small portion of the clients may eliminate the problem. While traditionally load balancing strategies have been designed to change consumers' consumption patterns to make demand more uniform, developments in energy storage and individual renewable energy generation have provided opportunities to devise balanced power grids without affecting consumers' behavior. Typically, storing energy during off-peak times eases high demand supply during peak hours. Dynamic game-theoretic frameworks have proved particularly efficient at storage scheduling by optimizing energy cost using their Nash equilibrium. Peak curtailment/leveling and time of use pricing Peak load avoidance by smart charging of electric vehicles To reduce demand during the high cost peak usage periods, communications and metering technologies inform smart devices in the home and business when energy demand is high and track how much electricity is used and when it is used. It also gives utility companies the ability to reduce consumption by communicating to devices directly in order to prevent system overloads. Examples would be a utility reducing the usage of a group of electric vehicle charging stations or shifting temperature set points of air conditioners in a city. To motivate them to cut back use and perform what is called peak curtailment or peak leveling, prices of electricity are increased during high demand periods, and decreased during low demand periods. It is thought that consumers and businesses will tend to consume less during high demand periods if it is possible for consumers and consumer devices to be aware of the high price premium for using electricity at peak periods. This could mean making trade-offs such as cycling on/off air conditioners or running dishwashers at 9 pm instead of 5 pm. When businesses and consumers see a direct economic benefit of using energy at off-peak times, the theory is that they will include energy cost of operation into their consumer device and building construction decisions and hence become more energy efficient. See Time of day metering and demand response. = Sustainability = The improved flexibility of the smart grid permits greater penetration of highly variable renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind power, even without the addition of energy storage. Current network infrastructure is not built to allow for many distributed feed-in points, and typically even if some feed-in is allowed at the local (distribution) level, the transmission-level infrastructure cannot accommodate it. Rapid fluctuations in distributed generation, such as due to cloudy or gusty weather, present significant challenges to power engineers who need to ensure stable power levels through varying the output of the more controllable generators such as gas turbines and hydroelectric generators. Smart grid technology is a necessary condition for very large amounts of renewable electricity on the grid for this reason. There is also support for vehicle-to-grid.Smart Grid Environmental Benefits = Market- enabling = The smart grid allows for systematic communication between suppliers (their energy price) and consumers (their willingness-to-pay), and permits both the suppliers and the consumers to be more flexible and sophisticated in their operational strategies. Only the critical loads will need to pay the peak energy prices, and consumers will be able to be more strategic in when they use energy. Generators with greater flexibility will be able to sell energy strategically for maximum profit, whereas inflexible generators such as base-load steam turbines and wind turbines will receive a varying tariff based on the level of demand and the status of the other generators currently operating. The overall effect is a signal that awards energy efficiency, and energy consumption that is sensitive to the time- varying limitations of the supply. At the domestic level, appliances with a degree of energy storage or thermal mass (such as refrigerators, heat banks, and heat pumps) will be well placed to 'play' the market and seek to minimise energy cost by adapting demand to the lower-cost energy support periods. This is an extension of the dual-tariff energy pricing mentioned above. Demand response support Demand response support allows generators and loads to interact in an automated fashion in real time, coordinating demand to flatten spikes. Eliminating the fraction of demand that occurs in these spikes eliminates the cost of adding reserve generators, cuts wear and tear and extends the life of equipment, and allows users to cut their energy bills by telling low priority devices to use energy only when it is cheapest.Energy Future Coalition, \\"Challenge and Opportunity: Charting a New Energy Future,\\" Appendix A: Working Group Reports, Report of the Smart Grid Working Group. https://web.archive.org/web/20080910051559/http://www.energyfuturecoalition.org/pubs/app_smart_grid.pdf Currently, power grid systems have varying degrees of communication within control systems for their high-value assets, such as in generating plants, transmission lines, substations and major energy users. In general information flows one way, from the users and the loads they control back to the utilities. The utilities attempt to meet the demand and succeed or fail to varying degrees (brownouts, rolling blackout, uncontrolled blackout). The total amount of power demand by the users can have a very wide probability distribution which requires spare generating plants in standby mode to respond to the rapidly changing power usage. This one-way flow of information is expensive; the last 10% of generating capacity may be required as little as 1% of the time, and brownouts and outages can be costly to consumers. Demand response can be provided by commercial, residential loads, and industrial loads. For example, Alcoa's Warrick Operation is participating in MISO as a qualified Demand Response Resource, and the Trimet Aluminium uses its smelter as a short-term mega-battery. Latency of the data flow is a major concern, with some early smart meter architectures allowing actually as long as 24 hours delay in receiving the data, preventing any possible reaction by either supplying or demanding devices.Why the Smart Grid Won't Have the Innovations of the Internet Any Time Soon: Cleantech News and Analysis «.

Platform for advanced services As with other industries, use of robust two-way communications, advanced sensors, and distributed computing technology will improve the efficiency, reliability and safety of power delivery and use. It also opens up the potential for entirely new services or improvements on existing ones, such as fire monitoring and alarms that can shut off power, make phone calls to emergency services, etc. Provision megabits, control power with kilobits, sell the rest The amount of data required to perform monitoring and switching one's appliances off automatically is very small compared with that already reaching even remote homes to support voice, security, Internet and TV services. Many smart grid bandwidth upgrades are paid for by over-provisioning to also support consumer services, and subsidizing the communications with energy-related services or subsidizing the energy-related services, such as higher rates during peak hours, with communications. This is particularly true where governments run both sets of services as a public monopoly. Because power and communications companies are generally separate commercial enterprises in North America and Europe, it has required considerable government and large-vendor effort to encourage various enterprises to cooperate. Some, like Cisco, see opportunity in providing devices to consumers very similar to those they have long been providing to industry.Cisco's Latest Consumer Play: The Smart Grid: Cleantech News and Analysis «.

While the AC power control standards suggest powerline networking would be the primary means of communication among smart grid and home devices, the bits may not reach the home via Broadband over Power Lines (BPL) initially but by fixed wireless. Technology The bulk of smart grid technologies are already used in other applications such as manufacturing and telecommunications and are being adapted for use in grid operations.U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory, Modern Grid Initiative, http://www.netl.doe.gov/moderngrid/opportunity/vision_technologies.html *Integrated communications: Areas for improvement include: substation automation, demand response, distribution automation, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), energy management systems, wireless mesh networks and other technologies, power-line carrier communications, and fiber-optics. Integrated communications will allow for real-time control, information and data exchange to optimize system reliability, asset utilization, and security.F.R. Yu, P. Zhang, W. Xiao, and P. Choudhury, \\"Communication Systems for Grid Integration of Renewable Energy Resources,\\" IEEE Network, vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 22-29, Sept. 2011. *Sensing and measurement: core duties are evaluating congestion and grid stability, monitoring equipment health, energy theft prevention, and control strategies support. Technologies include: advanced microprocessor meters (smart meter) and meter reading equipment, wide-area monitoring systems, (typically based on online readings by Distributed temperature sensing combined with Real time thermal rating (RTTR) systems), electromagnetic signature measurement/analysis, time-of-use and real-time pricing tools, advanced switches and cables, backscatter radio technology, and Digital protective relays. * Smart meters. * Phasor measurement units. Many in the power systems engineering community believe that the Northeast blackout of 2003 could have been contained to a much smaller area if a wide area phasor measurement network had been in place. * Distributed power flow control: power flow control devices clamp onto existing transmission lines to control the flow of power within. Transmission lines enabled with such devices support greater use of renewable energy by providing more consistent, real-time control over how that energy is routed within the grid. This technology enables the grid to more effectively store intermittent energy from renewables for later use. * Smart power generation using advanced components: smart power generation is a concept of matching electricity generation with demand using multiple identical generators which can start, stop and operate efficiently at chosen load, independently of the others, making them suitable for base load and peaking power generation. Matching supply and demand, called load balancing, is essential for a stable and reliable supply of electricity. Short-term deviations in the balance lead to frequency variations and a prolonged mismatch results in blackouts. Operators of power transmission systems are charged with the balancing task, matching the power output of all the generators to the load of their electrical grid. The load balancing task has become much more challenging as increasingly intermittent and variable generators such as wind turbines and solar cells are added to the grid, forcing other producers to adapt their output much more frequently than has been required in the past. First two dynamic grid stability power plants utilizing the concept has been ordered by Elering and will be built by Wärtsilä in Kiisa, Estonia (Kiisa Power Plant). Their purpose is to \\"provide dynamic generation capacity to meet sudden and unexpected drops in the electricity supply.\\" They are scheduled to be ready during 2013 and 2014, and their total output will be 250 MW.Toomas Hõbemägi, Baltic Business News * Power system automation enables rapid diagnosis of and precise solutions to specific grid disruptions or outages. These technologies rely on and contribute to each of the other four key areas. Three technology categories for advanced control methods are: distributed intelligent agents (control systems), analytical tools (software algorithms and high-speed computers), and operational applications (SCADA, substation automation, demand response, etc.). Using artificial intelligence programming techniques, Fujian power grid in China created a wide area protection system that is rapidly able to accurately calculate a control strategy and execute it. Examples are given of two events, one stabilizing the system after a fault on a 1 gigawatt HVDC feed, with response timed in milliseconds. The Voltage Stability Monitoring & Control (VSMC) software uses a sensitivity-based successive linear programming method to reliably determine the optimal control solution. = IT companies disrupting the energy market = Smart grid provides IT-based solutions which the traditional power grid is lacking. These new solutions pave the way of new entrants that were traditionally not related to the energy grid. Technology companies are disrupting the traditional energy market players in several ways. They develop complex distribution systems to meet the more decentralized power generation due to microgrids. Additionally is the increase in data collection bringing many new possibilities for technology companies as deploying transmission grid sensors at a user level and balancing system reserves. The technology in microgrids makes energy consumption cheaper for households than buying from utilities. Additionally, residents can manage their energy consumption easier and more effectively with the connection to smart meters. However, the performances and reliability of microgrids strongly depend on the continuous interaction between power generation, storage and load requirements. A hybrid offering combining renewable energy sources with storing energy sources as coal and gas is showing the hybrid offering of a microgrid serving alone.  Consequences  As a consequence of the entrance of the technology companies in the energy market, utilities and DSO's need to create new business models to keep current customers and to create new customers.  Focus on a customer engagement strategy  DSO's can focus on creating good customer engagement strategies to create loyalty and trust towards the customer. To retain and attract customers who decide to produce their own energy through microgrids, DSO's can offer purchase agreements for the sale of surplus energy that the consumer produces. Indifference from the IT companies, both DSO's and utilities can use their market experience to give consumers energy-use advice and efficiency upgrades to create excellent customer service.  Create alliances with new entered technology companies  Instead of trying to compete against IT companies in their expertise, both utilities and DSO's can try to create alliances with IT companies to create good solutions together. The French utility company Engie did this by buying the service provider Ecova and OpTerra Energy Services.  Renewable energy sources  The generation of renewable energy can often be connected at the distribution level, instead of the transmission grids, which means that DSO's can manage the flows and distribute power locally. This brings new opportunity for DSO's to expand their market by selling energy directly to the consumer. Simultaneously, this is challenging the utilities producing fossil fuels who already are trapped by high costs of aging assets. Stricter regulations for producing traditional energy resources from the government increases the difficulty of stay in business and increases the pressure on traditional energy companies to make the shift to renewable energy sources. An example of a utility changing business model to produce more renewable energy is the Norwegian-based company, Equinor, which was a state-owned oil company which now are heavily investing in renewable energy.  Research  = Major programs = IntelliGrid – Created by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), IntelliGrid architecture provides methodology, tools, and recommendations for standards and technologies for utility use in planning, specifying, and procuring IT-based systems, such as advanced metering, distribution automation, and demand response.

It created another platform for a Smart Grid architecture enabling bidirectional flow of information between a utility and consumer end-devices - WINSmartGrid™. SMERC has also developed a demand response (DR) test bed that comprises a Control Center, Demand Response Automation Server (DRAS), Home-Area-Network (HAN), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and photovoltaic (PV) panels. These technologies are installed within the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Southern California Edison territory as a network of EV chargers, battery energy storage systems, solar panels, DC fast charger, and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) units. These platforms, communications and control networks enables UCLA-led projects within the greater Los Angeles to be researched, advanced and tested in partnership with the two key local utilities, SCE and LADWP.Smart Grid Energy Research Center = Smart grid modelling = Many different concepts have been used to model intelligent power grids. They are generally studied within the framework of complex systems. In a recent brainstorming session, the power grid was considered within the context of optimal control, ecology, human cognition, glassy dynamics, information theory, microphysics of clouds, and many others. Here is a selection of the types of analyses that have appeared in recent years. ;Protection systems that verify and supervise themselves Pelqim Spahiu and Ian R. Evans in their study introduced the concept of a substation based smart protection and hybrid Inspection Unit. ;Kuramoto oscillators The Kuramoto model is a well-studied system. The power grid has been described in this context as well. The goal is to keep the system in balance, or to maintain phase synchronization (also known as phase locking). Non-uniform oscillators also help to model different technologies, different types of power generators, patterns of consumption, and so on. The model has also been used to describe the synchronization patterns in the blinking of fireflies. ;Bio-systems Power grids have been related to complex biological systems in many other contexts. In one study, power grids were compared to the dolphin social network. These creatures streamline or intensify communication in case of an unusual situation. The intercommunications that enable them to survive are highly complex. ;Random fuse networks In percolation theory, random fuse networks have been studied. The current density might be too low in some areas, and too strong in others. The analysis can therefore be used to smooth out potential problems in the network. For instance, high-speed computer analysis can predict blown fuses and correct for them, or analyze patterns that might lead to a power outage. It is difficult for humans to predict the long term patterns in complex networks, so fuse or diode networks are used instead. ;Smart Grid Communication Network Network Simulators are used to simulate/emulate network communication effects. This typically involves setting up a lab with the smart grid devices, applications etc. with the virtual network being provided by the network simulator. ;Neural networks Neural networks have been considered for power grid management as well. Electric power systems can be classified in multiple different ways: non- linear, dynamic, discrete, or random. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) attempt to solve the most difficult of these problems, the non-linear problems. ;Demand Forecasting One application of ANNs is in demand forecasting. In order for grids to operate economically and reliably, demand forecasting is essential, because it is used to predict the amount of power that will be consumed by the load. This is dependent on weather conditions, type of day, random events, incidents, etc. For non-linear loads though, the load profile isn't smooth and as predictable, resulting in higher uncertainty and less accuracy using the traditional Artificial Intelligence models. Some factors that ANNs consider when developing these sort of models: classification of load profiles of different customer classes based on the consumption of electricity, increased responsiveness of demand to predict real time electricity prices as compared to conventional grids, the need to input past demand as different components, such as peak load, base load, valley load, average load, etc. instead of joining them into a single input, and lastly, the dependence of the type on specific input variables. An example of the last case would be given the type of day, whether its weekday or weekend, that wouldn't have much of an effect on Hospital grids, but it'd be a big factor in resident housing grids' load profile. ;Markov processes As wind power continues to gain popularity, it becomes a necessary ingredient in realistic power grid studies. Off-line storage, wind variability, supply, demand, pricing, and other factors can be modelled as a mathematical game. Here the goal is to develop a winning strategy. Markov processes have been used to model and study this type of system. ;Maximum entropy All of these methods are, in one way or another, maximum entropy methods, which is an active area of research. This goes back to the ideas of Shannon, and many other researchers who studied communication networks. Continuing along similar lines today, modern wireless network research often considers the problem of network congestion, and many algorithms are being proposed to minimize it, including game theory, innovative combinations of FDMA, TDMA, and others. Economics =Market outlook= In 2009, the US smart grid industry was valued at about $21.4 billion – by 2014, it will exceed at least $42.8 billion. Given the success of the smart grids in the U.S., the world market is expected to grow at a faster rate, surging from $69.3 billion in 2009 to $171.4 billion by 2014. With the segments set to benefit the most will be smart metering hardware sellers and makers of software used to transmit and organize the massive amount of data collected by meters. The size of Smart Grid Market was valued at over US$30 billion in 2017 and is set to expand over 11% CAGR to hit US$70 Billion by 2024. Growing need to digitalize the power sector driven by ageing electrical grid infrastructure will stimulate the global market size. The industry is primarily driven by favorable government regulations and mandates along with rising share of renewables in the global energy mix. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global investments in digital electricity infrastructure was over US$50 billion in 2017. A 2011 study from the Electric Power Research Institute concludes that investment in a U.S. smart grid will cost up to $476 billion over 20 years but will provide up to $2 trillion in customer benefits over that time. In 2015, the World Economic Forum reported a transformational investment of more than $7.6 trillion by members of the OECD is needed over the next 25 years (or $300 billion per year) to modernize, expand, and decentralize the electricity infrastructure with technical innovation as key to the transformation. A 2019 study from International Energy Agency estimates that the current (depriciated) value of the US electric grid is more than USD 1 trillion. The total cost of replacing it with a smart grid is estimated to be more than USD 4 trillion. If smart grids are deployed fully across the US, the country expects to save USD 130 billion annually. =General economics developments= As customers can choose their electricity suppliers, depending on their different tariff methods, the focus of transportation costs will be increased. Reduction of maintenance and replacements costs will stimulate more advanced control. A smart grid precisely limits electrical power down to the residential level, network small-scale distributed energy generation and storage devices, communicate information on operating status and needs, collect information on prices and grid conditions, and move the grid beyond central control to a collaborative network. US and UK savings estimates and concerns A 2003 United States Department of Energy study calculated that internal modernization of US grids with smart grid capabilities would save between 46 and 117 billion dollars over the next 20 years if implemented within a few years of the study. As well as these industrial modernization benefits, smart grid features could expand energy efficiency beyond the grid into the home by coordinating low priority home devices such as water heaters so that their use of power takes advantage of the most desirable energy sources. Smart grids can also coordinate the production of power from large numbers of small power producers such as owners of rooftop solar panels — an arrangement that would otherwise prove problematic for power systems operators at local utilities. One important question is whether consumers will act in response to market signals. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Smart Grid Investment Grant and Demonstrations Program funded special consumer behavior studies to examine the acceptance, retention, and response of consumers subscribed to time-based utility rate programs that involve advanced metering infrastructure and customer systems such as in-home displays and programmable communicating thermostats. Another concern is that the cost of telecommunications to fully support smart grids may be prohibitive. A less expensive communication mechanism is proposed using a form of \\"dynamic demand management\\" where devices shave peaks by shifting their loads in reaction to grid frequency. Grid frequency could be used to communicate load information without the need of an additional telecommunication network, but it would not support economic bargaining or quantification of contributions. Although there are specific and proven smart grid technologies in use, smart grid is an aggregate term for a set of related technologies on which a specification is generally agreed, rather than a name for a specific technology. Some of the benefits of such a modernized electricity network include the ability to reduce power consumption at the consumer side during peak hours, called demand side management; enabling grid connection of distributed generation power (with photovoltaic arrays, small wind turbines, micro hydro, or even combined heat power generators in buildings); incorporating grid energy storage for distributed generation load balancing; and eliminating or containing failures such as widespread power grid cascading failures. The increased efficiency and reliability of the smart grid is expected to save consumers money and help reduce emissions.Smart Grid and Renewable Energy Monitoring Systems, SpeakSolar.org 03rd September 2010 Oppositions and concerns Most opposition and concerns have centered on smart meters and the items (such as remote control, remote disconnect, and variable rate pricing) enabled by them. Where opposition to smart meters is encountered, they are often marketed as \\"smart grid\\" which connects smart grid to smart meters in the eyes of opponents. Specific points of opposition or concern include: *consumer concerns over privacy, e.g. use of usage data by law enforcement *social concerns over \\"fair\\" availability of electricity *concern that complex rate systems (e.g. variable rates) remove clarity and accountability, allowing the supplier to take advantage of the customer *concern over remotely controllable \\"kill switch\\" incorporated into most smart meters *social concerns over Enron style abuses of information leverage *concerns over giving the government mechanisms to control the use of all power using activities *concerns over RF emissions from smart meters =Security= While modernization of electrical grids into smart grids allows for optimization of everyday processes, a smart grid, being online, can be vulnerable to cyberattacks.Demertzis K., Iliadis L. (2018) A Computational Intelligence System Identifying Cyber-Attacks on Smart Energy Grids. In: Daras N., Rassias T. (eds) Modern Discrete Mathematics and Analysis. Springer Optimization and Its Applications, vol 131. Springer, Cham Transformers which increase the voltage of electricity created at power plants for long-distance travel, transmission lines themselves, and distribution lines which deliver the electricity to its consumers are particularly susceptible. These systems rely on sensors which gather information from the field and then deliver it to control centers, where algorithms automate analysis and decision-making processes. These decisions are sent back to the field, where existing equipment execute them. Hackers have the potential to disrupt these automated control systems, severing the channels which allow generated electricity to be utilized. This is called a denial of service or DoS attack. They can also launch integrity attacks which corrupt information being transmitted along the system as well as desynchronization attacks which affect when such information is delivered to the appropriate location. Additionally, intruders can again access via renewable energy generation systems and smart meters connected to the grid, taking advantage of more specialized weaknesses or ones whose security has not been prioritized. Because a smart grid has a large number of access points, like smart meters, defending all of its weak points can prove difficult. There is also concern on the security of the infrastructure, primarily that involving communications technology. Concerns chiefly center around the communications technology at the heart of the smart grid. Designed to allow real-time contact between utilities and meters in customers' homes and businesses, there is a risk that these capabilities could be exploited for criminal or even terrorist actions. One of the key capabilities of this connectivity is the ability to remotely switch off power supplies, enabling utilities to quickly and easily cease or modify supplies to customers who default on payment. This is undoubtedly a massive boon for energy providers, but also raises some significant security issues. Cybercriminals have infiltrated the U.S. electric grid before on numerous occasions. Aside from computer infiltration, there are also concerns that computer malware like Stuxnet, which targeted SCADA systems which are widely used in industry, could be used to attack a smart grid network.Qin, Y., Cao, X., Liang, P.: Hu, Q.: Zhang, W.: Research on the analytic factor neuron model based on cloud generator and its application in oil&gas; SCADA security defense. In: 2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems (CCIS) (2014). https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175721 Electricity theft is a concern in the U.S. where the smart meters being deployed use RF technology to communicate with the electricity transmission network. People with knowledge of electronics can devise interference devices to cause the smart meter to report lower than actual usage. Similarly, the same technology can be employed to make it appear that the energy the consumer is using is being used by another customer, increasing their bill. The damage from a well-executed, sizable cyberattack could be extensive and long-lasting. One incapacitated substation could take from nine days to over a year to repair, depending on the nature of the attack. It can also cause an hours-long outage in a small radius. It could have an immediate effect on transportation infrastructure, as traffic lights and other routing mechanisms as well as ventilation equipment for underground roadways is reliant on electricity. Additionally, infrastructure which relies on the electric grid, including wastewater treatment facilities, the information technology sector, and communications systems could be impacted. The December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack, the first recorded of its kind, disrupted services to nearly a quarter of a million people by bringing substations offline. The Council on Foreign Relations has noted that states are most likely to be the perpetrators of such an attack as they have access to the resources to carry one out despite the high level of difficulty of doing so. Cyber intrusions can be used as portions of a larger offensive, military or otherwise. Some security experts warn that this type of event is easily scalable to grids elsewhere. Insurance company Lloyd's of London has already modeled the outcome of a cyberattack on the Eastern Interconnection, which has the potential to impact 15 states, put 93 million people in the dark, and cost the country's economy anywhere from $243 billion to $1 trillion in various damages. According to the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, the electric grid has already seen a sizable number of cyber intrusions, with two in every five aiming to incapacitate it. As such, the U.S. Department of Energy has prioritized research and development to decrease the electric grid's vulnerability to cyberattacks, citing them as an \\"imminent danger\\" in its 2017 Quadrennial Energy Review. The Department of Energy has also identified both attack resistance and self-healing as major keys to ensuring that today's smart grid is future-proof. While there are regulations already in place, namely the Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards introduced by the North America Electric Reliability Council, a significant number of them are suggestions rather than mandates. Most electricity generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and equipment are owned by private stakeholders, further complicating the task of assessing adherence to such standards. Additionally, even if utilities want to fully comply, they may find that it is too expensive to do so. Some experts argue that the first step to increasing the cyber defenses of the smart electric grid is completing a comprehensive risk analysis of existing infrastructure, including research of software, hardware, and communication processes. Additionally, as intrusions themselves can provide valuable information, it could be useful to analyze system logs and other records of their nature and timing. Common weaknesses already identified using such methods by the Department of Homeland Security include poor code quality, improper authentication, and weak firewall rules. Once this step is completed, some suggest that it makes sense to then complete an analysis of the potential consequences of the aforementioned failures or shortcomings. This includes both immediate consequences as well as second- and third-order cascading effects on parallel systems. Finally, risk mitigation solutions, which may include simple remediation of infrastructure inadequacies or novel strategies, can be deployed to address the situation. Some such measures include recoding of control system algorithms to make them more able to resist and recover from cyberattacks or preventive techniques that allow more efficient detection of unusual or unauthorized changes to data. Strategies to account for human error which can compromise systems include educating those who work in the field to be wary of strange USB drives, which can introduce malware if inserted, even if just to check their contents. Other solutions include utilizing transmission substations, constrained SCADA networks, policy based data sharing, and attestation for constrained smart meters. Transmission substations utilize one-time signature authentication technologies and one-way hash chain constructs. These constraints have since been remedied with the creation of a fast-signing and verification technology and buffering-free data processing.Khurana, Himanshu. Frincke, Deborah. Liu, Ning. Hadley, Mark. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ning_Lu4/publication/224110557_Smart- Grid_Security_Issues/links/0f31752dab2b75c231000000.pdf . Web. Accessed on April 8th, 2017. A similar solution has been constructed for constrained SCADA networks. This involves applying a Hash-Based Message Authentication Code to byte streams, converting the random-error detection available on legacy systems to a mechanism that guarantees data authenticity. Policy-based data sharing utilizes GPS-clock-synchronized-fine-grain power grid measurements to provide increased grid stability and reliability. It does this through synchro-phasor requirements that are gathered by PMUs. Attestation for constrained smart meters faces a slightly different challenge, however. One of the biggest issues with attestation for constrained smart meters is that in order to prevent energy theft, and similar attacks, cyber security providers have to make sure that the devices’ software is authentic. To combat this problem, an architecture for constrained smart networks has been created and implemented at a low level in the embedded system. Other challenges to adoption Before a utility installs an advanced metering system, or any type of smart system, it must make a business case for the investment. Some components, like the power system stabilizers (PSS) installed on generators are very expensive, require complex integration in the grid's control system, are needed only during emergencies, and are only effective if other suppliers on the network have them. Without any incentive to install them, power suppliers don't. Most utilities find it difficult to justify installing a communications infrastructure for a single application (e.g. meter reading). Because of this, a utility must typically identify several applications that will use the same communications infrastructure – for example, reading a meter, monitoring power quality, remote connection and disconnection of customers, enabling demand response, etc. Ideally, the communications infrastructure will not only support near-term applications, but unanticipated applications that will arise in the future. Regulatory or legislative actions can also drive utilities to implement pieces of a smart grid puzzle. Each utility has a unique set of business, regulatory, and legislative drivers that guide its investments. This means that each utility will take a different path to creating their smart grid and that different utilities will create smart grids at different adoption rates. Some features of smart grids draw opposition from industries that currently are, or hope to provide similar services. An example is competition with cable and DSL Internet providers from broadband over powerline internet access. Providers of SCADA control systems for grids have intentionally designed proprietary hardware, protocols and software so that they cannot inter-operate with other systems in order to tie its customers to the vendor. The incorporation of digital communications and computer infrastructure with the grid's existing physical infrastructure poses challenges and inherent vulnerabilities. According to IEEE Security and Privacy Magazine, the smart grid will require that people develop and use large computer and communication infrastructure that supports a greater degree of situational awareness and that allows for more specific command and control operations. This process is necessary to support major systems such as demand- response wide-area measurement and control, storage and transportation of electricity, and the automation of electric distribution. =Power Theft / Power Loss= Various \\"smart grid\\" systems have dual functions. This includes Advanced Metering Infrastructure systems which, when used with various software can be used to detect power theft and by process of elimination, detect where equipment failures have taken place. These are in addition to their primary functions of eliminating the need for human meter reading and measuring the time-of-use of electricity. The worldwide power loss including theft is estimated at approximately two-hundred billion dollars annually. Electricity theft also represents a major challenge when providing reliable electrical service in developing countries. Deployments and attempted deployments Enel. The earliest, and one of the largest, example of a smart grid is the Italian system installed by Enel S.p.A. of Italy. Completed in 2005, the Telegestore project was highly unusual in the utility world because the company designed and manufactured their own meters, acted as their own system integrator, and developed their own system software. The Telegestore project is widely regarded as the first commercial scale use of smart grid technology to the home, and delivers annual savings of 500 million euro at a project cost of 2.1 billion euro. US Dept. of Energy - ARRA Smart Grid Project: One of the largest deployment programs in the world to-date is the U.S. Dept. of Energy's Smart Grid Program funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This program required matching funding from individual utilities. A total of over $9 billion in Public/Private funds were invested as part of this program. Technologies included Advanced Metering Infrastructure, including over 65 million Advanced \\"Smart\\" Meters, Customer Interface Systems, Distribution & Substation Automation, Volt/VAR Optimization Systems, over 1,000 Synchrophasors, Dynamic Line Rating, Cyber Security Projects, Advanced Distribution Management Systems, Energy Storage Systems, and Renewable Energy Integration Projects. This program consisted of Investment Grants (matching), Demonstration Projects, Consumer Acceptance Studies, and Workforce Education Programs. Reports from all individual utility programs as well as overall impact reports will be completed by the second quarter of 2015. Austin, Texas. In the US, the city of Austin, Texas has been working on building its smart grid since 2003, when its utility first replaced 1/3 of its manual meters with smart meters that communicate via a wireless mesh network. It currently manages 200,000 devices real-time (smart meters, smart thermostats, and sensors across its service area), and expects to be supporting 500,000 devices real-time in 2009 servicing 1 million consumers and 43,000 businesses. Boulder, Colorado completed the first phase of its smart grid project in August 2008. Both systems use the smart meter as a gateway to the home automation network (HAN) that controls smart sockets and devices. Some HAN designers favor decoupling control functions from the meter, out of concern of future mismatches with new standards and technologies available from the fast moving business segment of home electronic devices. Hydro One, in Ontario, Canada is in the midst of a large-scale Smart Grid initiative, deploying a standards-compliant communications infrastructure from Trilliant. By the end of 2010, the system will serve 1.3 million customers in the province of Ontario.

One of the first attempted deployments of \\"smart grid\\" technologies in the United States was rejected in 2009 by electricity regulators in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a US state.Massachusetts rejects utility's prepayment plan for low income customers, The Boston Globe, 2009-07-23 According to an article in the Boston Globe, Northeast Utilities' Western Massachusetts Electric Co. subsidiary actually attempted to create a \\"smart grid\\" program using public subsidies that would switch low income customers from post-pay to pre-pay billing (using \\"smart cards\\") in addition to special hiked \\"premium\\" rates for electricity used above a predetermined amount. This plan was rejected by regulators as it \\"eroded important protections for low-income customers against shutoffs\\". According to the Boston Globe, the plan \\"unfairly targeted low-income customers and circumvented Massachusetts laws meant to help struggling consumers keep the lights on\\". A spokesman for an environmental group supportive of smart grid plans and Western Massachusetts' Electric's aforementioned \\"smart grid\\" plan, in particular, stated \\"If used properly, smart grid technology has a lot of potential for reducing peak demand, which would allow us to shut down some of the oldest, dirtiest power plants...

LIFE Factory Microgrid (LIFE13 ENV / ES / 000700) is a demonstrative project that is part of the LIFE+ 2013 program (European Commission), whose main objective is to demonstrate, through the implementation of a full-scale industrial smartgrid that microgrids can become one of the most suitable solutions for energy generation and management in factories that want to minimize their environmental impact. EPB in Chattanooga, TN is a municipally-owned electric utility that started construction of a smart grid in 2008, receiving a $111,567,606 grant from the US DOE in 2009 to expedite construction and implementation (for a total budget of $232,219,350). Deployment of power-line interrupters (1170 units) was completed in April 2012, and deployment of smart meters (172,079 units) was completed in 2013. The smart grid's backbone fiber-optic system was also used to provide the first gigabit-speed internet connection to residential customers in the US through the Fiber to the Home initiative, and now speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second are available to residents. The smart grid is estimated to have reduced power outages by an average of 60%, saving the city about 60 million dollars annually. It has also reduced the need for \\"truck rolls\\" to scout and troubleshoot faults, resulting in an estimated reduction of 630,000 truck driving miles, and 4.7 million pounds of carbon emissions. In January 2016, EPB became the first major power distribution system to earn Performance Excellence in Electricity Renewal (PEER) certification. =OpenADR Implementations= Certain deployments utilize the OpenADR standard for load shedding and demand reduction during higher demand periods. China The smart grid market in China is estimated to be $22.3 billion with a projected growth to $61.4 billion by 2015. Honeywell is developing a demand response pilot and feasibility study for China with the State Grid Corp. of China using the OpenADR demand response standard. The State Grid Corp., the Chinese Academy of Science, and General Electric intend to work together to develop standards for China's smart grid rollout.Li, Jerry (2009), From Strong to Smart: the Chinese Smart Grid and its relation with the Globe, AEPN, Article No. 0018602. Available at Researchgate or the author's personal page United Kingdom The OpenADR standard was demonstrated in Bracknell, England, where peak use in commercial buildings was reduced by 45 percent. As a result of the pilot, the Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) said it would connect up to 30 commercial and industrial buildings in Thames Valley, west of London, to a demand response program. United States In 2009, the US Department of Energy awarded an $11 million grant to Southern California Edison and Honeywell for a demand response program that automatically turns down energy use during peak hours for participating industrial customers. The Department of Energy awarded an $11.4 million grant to Honeywell to implement the program using the OpenADR standard. Hawaiian Electric Co. (HECO) is implementing a two-year pilot project to test the ability of an ADR program to respond to the intermittence of wind power. Hawaii has a goal to obtain 70 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2030. HECO will give customers incentives for reducing power consumption within 10 minutes of a notice. Guidelines, standards and user groups Part of the IEEE Smart Grid Initiative, IEEE 2030.2 represents an extension of the work aimed at utility storage systems for transmission and distribution networks. The IEEE P2030 group expects to deliver early 2011 an overarching set of guidelines on smart grid interfaces. The new guidelines will cover areas including batteries and supercapacitors as well as flywheels. The group has also spun out a 2030.1 effort drafting guidelines for integrating electric vehicles into the smart grid. IEC TC 57 has created a family of international standards that can be used as part of the smart grid. These standards include IEC 61850 which is an architecture for substation automation, and IEC 61970/61968 – the Common Information Model (CIM). The CIM provides for common semantics to be used for turning data into information. OpenADR is an open-source smart grid communications standard used for demand response applications. It is typically used to send information and signals to cause electrical power-using devices to be turned off during periods of higher demand. MultiSpeak has created a specification that supports distribution functionality of the smart grid. MultiSpeak has a robust set of integration definitions that supports nearly all of the software interfaces necessary for a distribution utility or for the distribution portion of a vertically integrated utility. MultiSpeak integration is defined using extensible markup language (XML) and web services. The IEEE has created a standard to support synchrophasors – C37.118.https://web.archive.org/web/20081227010910/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/standardstoc.jsp?isnumber=33838 The UCA International User Group discusses and supports real world experience of the standards used in smart grids. A utility task group within LonMark International deals with smart grid related issues. There is a growing trend towards the use of TCP/IP technology as a common communication platform for smart meter applications, so that utilities can deploy multiple communication systems, while using IP technology as a common management platform.Cisco Outlines Strategy for Highly Secure, 'Smart Grid' Infrastructure -> Cisco News .

Bishopbriggs Academy is a non-denominational, co-educational, comprehensive school taking pupils from S1 to S6. It is currently one of two secondary schools in Bishopbriggs, along with Turnbull High School at Brackenbrae. The school was established in August 2006 as a result of the amalgamation of Bishopbriggs High School and Thomas Muir High School. In January 2013 the school received four \\"Excellent\\" grades and one \\"Very Good\\" in an Education Scotland Inspection Report. This was the first time ever that education Education Scotland had awarded four \\"Excellent\\" grades under the new inspection standards which ranks school on 5 areas. The Inspectors also described the Academy as an 'outstanding school'. The school has been named 'The Scottish State Secondary School of the Year' by the Sunday Times in the Sunday Times School Guide twice, in 2014 and again in 2017. http://www.bishopbriggs.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/_files/bishopbriggs_academy_award_edc_pdf.pdf The school consistently ranks at the top of the school exam league tables. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/best-uk-schools-guide-parent-power- tr95xdztg https://www.scotsman.com/education/these-are-20-best-schools- scotland-ranked-higher-results-2846296?page=3 History thumb The old Thomas Muir High school building. The two antecedent secondary schools were originally established to meet local demand during Bishopbriggs' housing boom beginning in the 1960s. Bishopbriggs High School was opened by Lanark County Council in 1965 and designed by Simon Pollard. It replaced the previous Bishopbriggs Higher Grade School which had originally opened in 1896, designed by David Woodburn Sturrock, and featured inscriptions on its clock tower, commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria that year. This catered only for pupils up to S4 with most leaving at age 15 (S3). Higher Grade pupils transferred to Lenzie Academy in Dunbartonshire. The school and its pupils appeared in an award-winning 1959 amateur film, L' Inspecteur. The former Bishopbriggs Higher Grade School building was converted into the town library after the completion of the new High School building. Thomas Muir High School was named after the local historical political radical, Thomas Muir, and opened in 1979, to serve the expanding Woodhill area of the town. =New academy= Bishopbriggs High School and Thomas Muir High School merged in 2006 to form Bishopbriggs Academy as part of a £100million PPP plan to build six new secondary schools in East Dunbartonshire. The school is now situated at the site of the former Thomas Muir High School on Wester Cleddens Road, where the new campus was completed in August 2009. Prior to that, Bishopbriggs Academy had been located at the former Bishopbriggs High School buildings near Bishopbriggs Cross, which were demolished during June 2010. The council consultation with parents had initially resulted in an agreement that the school would be built on the Bishopbriggs High School site, however this decision was later reversed in favour of the Thomas Muir site in Woodhill, releasing the more valuable BHS site for a proposed supermarket. Teaching and facilities The school follows the Scottish Qualification Authorities curriculum, offering from National 3 up to Advanced Highers. The school has over 100 teachers, over 40 non-teaching staff (librarian, office staff, kitchen staff, technicians, facilities etc.) and offers around 30 subjects. The school offers over 35 extracurricular activities including football, rugby, athletics, skiing, badminton, public speaking, choir, theatre, supported study, youth and philanthropy initiative (for seniors) and Duke of Edinburgh awards scheme.http://www.bishopbriggs.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/_files/bishopbriggs_handbook.pdf The school is split over three levels and has a library with computers for study,http://www.bishopbriggs.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/page_viewer.asp?page=Library&pid;=83 three gym halls, a fitness suite, and specialised science, computing, art, design and technology classrooms, study areas, a dining hall, and two athletic fields (one grass, one artificial).http://www.bishopbriggs.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/_files/school_map.pdf As of 2019 the grass pitch has been carved up into two separate sections, one of which has been converted into an artificial grass hockey pitch which is used by the Academy and the neighbouring primary school Thomas Muir.

Biography  Polotsky was born in Zürich, Switzerland, as the son of a Russian Jewish couple. He grew up in Berlin and studied Egyptology and Semitics at the universities of Berlin and Göttingen. From 1926 to 1931 he was a co-worker of the Septuaginta-Unternehmen of the Academy of Sciences at Göttingen. In 1929 he received his Ph.D. degree for the dissertation Zu den Inschriften der 11. Dynastie. He worked in Berlin editing Coptic Manichaean texts from 1933 till 1934, with the Church historian Carl Schmidt. He left Germany in 1935 and settled in Mandate Palestine, where he taught and researched at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, becoming professor in 1948. In 1953 he founded the Linguistics department there and later served as the dean of the Faculty of Humanities. He died in Jerusalem. His main achievement was the Études de syntaxe copte published in 1944 which fundamentally changed the scientific view of the syntax of the Coptic and earlier ancient Egyptian languages. Polotsky's theory of the Egyptian verb (a particularly delicate argument, since Egyptians distinguished their different verb forms mainly by the vocalizations, and vowels were not written) had so much success that it has been called the Standard Theory. In Berlin, Polotsky had been a student of the famous egyptologist Kurt Heinrich Sethe; in Jerusalem, one of his students was Miriam Lichtheim, known for her extensive translations of ancient Egyptian texts.

Legal & General Property bought the centre in 2011 for £92 million. It then passed to M&G; Real Estate for £110m.  Location  The main pedestrian entrance to the centre is from the pedestrianised Week Street (one of Maidstone's main shopping streets) to the east. There are other pedestrian entrances from St Faith's Street to the north and Earl Street, to the south. The A229 Fairmeadow runs parallel to the River Medway at the western end of the centre, but is approximately 2 storeys lower than the shopping centre. The car park for the centre is located below the House of Fraser department store at the western end; vehicle access is from Fairmeadow and Earl Street. Maidstone East railway station is north of the main pedestrian entrance, along Week Street.  History  The site was previously the Fremlin's Brewery. It closed to brewing in 1972 and the existing building was just used as a bottling depot. Later on, the site was downgraded once more to a despatch depot. The only original structure from when the site was a brewery, is the arch entrance and clock. To fit in with the scheme of 'new life' for the river area in the town, it was decided that the shipping depot should be demolished, and something new put in its place; a shopping centre. There are still many reminders of the site's past. For example, the management office buildings bear the original gold elephant weather vane, an icon of the company. Also, the Fremlins clock was replaced with an identical replica provided by Maidstone Rotary Club. The original brewery entrance has been maintained, and now forms one of the pedestrian entrances. One of the original trademark nodding elephants from the original brewery is on display, fully restored, in the adjacent Maidstone Museum & Art Gallery. In September 2016, Britain's Got Talent (TV show) held auditions at the Bandstand.  Retail  thumb The centre has over 50 shops, and these are mainly top high street brands, as well as phone shops, and various shoe shops. There are cafés, coffee shops and bench seating. Since its opening in 2005, Maidstone has made its way into the top 50 shopping towns in the UK, and now stands at 44th in 2013. The centre is anchored by a House of Fraser department store, at the western (Fairmeadow) end. Other large stores within the centre include Boots, River Island, Zara, and Superdry.

His first experience with photography was when he bought a Kodak Brownie at the age of seventeen. In the 1930s, his photographs were featured in pictorialist salons and publications. He served four years in the army during World War II in the 37th division and went to the Fiji Islands, New Georgia, Guadalcanal, and the Philippines. After the war, Jones entered the first class in photography offered by the California School of Fine Arts. There he met the artists and instructors that helped him develop his talents: Ansel Adams, Minor White, Edward Weston, and Dorothea Lange. Jones worked as Ansel Adams' assistant for 6 years, and the two photographers forged a lifelong friendship. Dorothea Lange came to him in 1956 with an idea to collaborate on a photographic essay entitled \\"Death of a Valley\\". The essay chronicled the death of the town of Monticello, California in the Berryessa Valley, which disappeared when the Monticello Dam was completed. The photographs were taken in the last year of its existence. Jones later described the project with Lange as \\"one of the most meaningful photographic experiences of [his] life\\". Jones also took part in numerous collaborations with his wife, Ruth-Marion Baruch, over the course of their 49-year marriage. In 1968, Ruth-Marion introduced herself to Kathleen Cleaver, wife of famous Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver, and spoke of her interest in the Black Panthers and their portrayal by the media. It was her desire to present a balanced view that inspired Jones and Ruth-Marion to photograph the Panthers from July to October 1968 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Jones was the recipient of an honorary doctorate from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he taught until 1994.

In 1950, the order bought the Tuckahoe Mansion on Mount Elizabeth, an ancient Native American midden in Jensen Beach and, after adding two dormitory wings to the mansion, moved the college and their novitiate into it. In 1957, the Sisters of St. Joseph converted the college into a regular liberal arts college, but only offered a two-year curriculum even though it was chartered as a four-year institution. Admission was still limited to members or potential members of the order. =1966–1972= In the fall of 1966, lay men and women were admitted but only on a non-residential basis. In January of the following year, the Sisters of St. Joseph decided to admit lay residential students, Accordingly, they bought a large tract on the west side of Indian River Drive and started building on it two three-story dormitories for residential students, one for men and one for women. In between the two dorms they built a one-story cafeteria building. The Sisters based their hopes for expansion on the determination that the Northeastern United States had a large Catholic population and exported large numbers of Catholic college students because its local Catholic institutions were not able to meet the demand. It was believed that Saint Joseph College would have no problems attracting these students. The Sisters moved their novitiate to property at the end of Britt Road in North Stuart before the first residential students arrived for the fall term of 1967, but the transition to a co-ed residential two-year college was not a smooth one. The new dorms were not finished and the residential students had to be housed in an old hotel building in downtown Stuart and bussed to the campus. The lack of adequate residential supervision resulted in disciplinary problems as well as friction with the local community. Also the haste of the conversion forced the college to operate on an 'open admissions' basis in order to fill its classes, since most of the students the Sisters had hoped to attract had already made commitments to attend other colleges. Having started off on the wrong foot, the college found that it was impossible to overcome the negative image it had acquired and was not able to break even financially and closed in May 1972. The campus was sold to Florida Institute of Technology for its Jensen Beach Campus. Although the college was experiencing problems in the community, the County Sheriff, Roy C Baker, was removed from office by Gov. Askew due to allegations of malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty, drunkenness, incompetence, and commission of a felony.

Its remains are in the Archaeological Park of Razgrad.http://www.abritus.org/index.html History A Thracian settlement of the 3rd–4th century BC has been found on the north bank of the Beli Lom river, and an early Roman settlement extended it in the late 1st or early 2nd century AD. At the end of the 1st century AD a Roman military camp was built, and in the 2nd century the Cohors II Lucensium of the Legio XI Claudia (based at Durostorum) was stationed here. In 251 during the Gothic invasions the Romans suffered a disastrous defeat and the death of the Emperor Decius and his son Herennius Etruscus at the Battle of Abritus, which took place about northwest of Abritus, in the valley of the river Beli Lom, to the south of the village of Dryanovets. The fortifications with massive walls, thick and high, were built around the town on the south bank of the river in 320–330 under Constantine the Great, seemingly for immigrant \\"barbarians\\" (foederati) as part of the policy of pacifying them.http://www.abritus.org/en/abritusmoreinfo/abritusprezwekowete/ziwotatwabritus.html However, the walls could not withstand the destruction of the city in the Gothic Wars in 376–8, in 447 by the Huns, and in the 480s again by the Goths. Each time it was rebuilt, and in the 5th–6th centuries Abritus was one of the largest cities in the province and seat of a bishop. The gates were narrowed under Justinian (527–565) to provide better security. However the city was destroyed by the Avars in 586. Later a Bulgarian mediaeval settlement was built, which existed until the 10th century. The first archaeological survey was done in 1887 by Ananie Yavashov, and regular excavations were conducted from 1953. The Site The walls enclosed and had 35 bastions projecting in front of the wall. The southern wall was more vulnerable than the others as it was overlooked by a slope outside, and hence the southern gate was recessed from the wall, which was also thicker in this area, and a moat was dug outside it for extra protection. Two of the bastions have superstructures built to the original height to accentuate their impressive size. Army barracks were located to the side of the north gate in which arms were discovered. Two aqueducts are known; one from the 2nd century originating at a spring near Peroishte southwest of the city, passing through ceramic pipes, and arriving under the south gate,Ivan Tsarov: “The Aqueducts in the Bulgarian Lands, 2nd-4th century AD”, p. 96 and the other coming from Nedoklan to the northeast. The largest late empire hoard of gold coins in Bulgaria was found just inside the eastern wall consisting of 835 gold coins weighing and dating from the 5th century, probably hidden during the invasion of the Goths 487.http://www.abritus.org/en/abritusmoreinfo/zlatnomonetnosykrowishte.html References Sources and external links * Teofil Ivanov & Stoyan Stoyanov (1985), ABRITVS - Its History and Archaeology, Razgrad: Cultural and Historical Heritage Directorate. * A.

They attacked from three points: General Pedro Sarsfield from Pamplona, General Espartero from Bilbao and a British-Spanish force under George de Lacy Evans from San Sebastián. On March 15 the British Legion conquered a fortification known as Oriamendi on a strategic hill near San Sebastián. The next day the Carlists under Sebastian de Borbón counterattacked and, after a long battle, drove the British-liberal army back to their trenches outside San Sebastian. This force had suffered between 1,000 and 1,500 casualties and covering fire from the Royal Navy prevented the withdrawal from becoming a disaster. The success of the Carlist troops laid in a defence-in-depth and their infantry's high mobility. After the battle the Carlists tightened their grip around San Sebastián, but never succeeded in taking the city. The defeat caused an outrage at the British parliament.

He has served with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for over 30 years in Sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East. After completing his degree in law in Milan, Geddo was assigned to Sudan as a JPO with UNHCR (1988-1991), covering the Ethiopian refugee crisis in Eastern Sudan and then from Khartoum as Associate Protection Officer. Between 1991 and 1993, he was posted as Protection Officer to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where he organized the return of South African refugees and exiles who had fled the apartheid regime, and started preparations for the voluntary repatriation of Mozambican refugees. He also conducted the census of Burundi refugees in camps and spearheaded the humanitarian response to the first inflow of Somali refugees. In 1994-1996, he served in UNHCR Headquarters, Geneva, as Senior Legal Advisor to the Africa Bureau covering Eastern Africa and the Horn, the Great Lakes Region and Southern Africa. From 1997 to 2001, Geddo was UNHCR Assistant Regional Representative (Protection) in Pretoria, South Africa with responsibility for refugee protection issues in Southern Africa (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Zimbabwe). In South Africa, in particular, Geddo represented UNHCR in the expert panel advising the Department of Home Affairs on the drafting of the 1998 Refugee Act, was instrumental in the Department's efforts to scale up capacity to deal with the backlog in asylum claims, and supported the South African Human Rights Commission in the design and implementation of the Roll Back Xenophobia campaign. Geddo spent the subsequent four years back in Geneva as Head of the Legal Advice Unit, Africa Bureau, providing position papers and legal advice on international refugee law and protection policy to senior management. In 2005-2008, Geddo served as UNHCR Representative in the Central African Republic, where he led the UNHCR response to the internal displacement crisis by setting up the first Protection Cluster in 2006, pursuant to the UN humanitarian coordination reform. He also managed the care and maintenance programme for camp-based refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo and the support programme for urban refugees from Burundi, Rwanda and the Republic of Congo, and oversaw voluntary repatriation of Chadian, Congolese and Sudanese refugees. Geddo also undertook a number of special missions in Darfur, Sudan (internally displaced persons and Chadian refugees) (2005), Limpopo, South Africa (Zimbabwean refugees and migrants) (2008), and Dadaab, Kenya (Somali refugees) (2009), then the largest refugee complex in the world. Geddo became UNHCR Representative for Somalia in 2009, based in Nairobi and then Mogadishu, leading the UNHCR humanitarian response to multiple internal displacement crises across the country and dealing with large-scale urban refugees in and mixed migration flows out of Puntland and Somaliland, as well as initial planning for possible return of Somali refugees from Kenya and Djibouti. Geddo also spearheaded a local integration programme based on permanent shelter for internally displaced persons in Central Somalia, supported by the UN Peacebuilding Fund. Furthermore, within the UN humanitarian coordination system, Geddo managed the UNHCR emergency response to the 2011/12 famine in South-Central Somalia, the worst since 1992. In 2013, Geddo moved on to Yemen as UNHCR Representative a.i. covering multiple refugee and internal displacement situations and a large programme for Ethiopian, Eritrean and Somali refugee in urban areas. He also dealt with the continuing mixed migration crisis from the Horn of Africa to the Arabian peninsula, in which Yemen was the pivotal transit hub. In this context, Geddo spearheaded preparations for the first international conference on mixed migration in the Gulf, organized by the Yemeni government with the technical support of UNHCR. Geddo was later appointed as UNHCR Representative to Mauritania (2014-2015) where he dealt with camp-based Tuareg and Arab refugees from Mali in the Sahel and West African refugees based in urban areas. Furthermore, he spearheaded consultations with refugees on the Mali peace process, including discussions on a possible Tripartite Agreement between Mauritania, Mali and UNHCR governing voluntary repatriation, and participation of a refugee delegation from Mauritania in the Mali peace process. From mid-2015 to 2019, Geddo was UNHCR Representative to Iraq, leading the UNHCR emergency preparedness and response to the rolling displacement crises arising from military activity to retake ISIS-held territory, in the framework of the UN Humanitarian Response Plan. In all, a total of five million internally displaced people were recorded over a four year period (one million evacuated from Mosul city alone), one of the largest and most complex humanitarian crises in recent years. At the same time, Geddo oversaw the UNHCR operation to support reintegration of internally displaced families who had started to return to their areas of origin, through cash grants, shelter repair and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. This was complemented by technical support to the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue fresh identity documents to displaced persons who had lost them during the war. In the post-conflict period, Geddo led the sustainable return and social cohesion working groups pursuant to the UN Recovery and Resilience Programme in preparation for the 2018 Iraq Reconstruction Conference. In parallel, Geddo managed the UNHCR programme to provide protection and assistance to up to 230,000 Syrian refugees in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, as well as some 20,000 Palestinian refugees in South-Central Iraq.

The origin of its name has been a local controversy: some say that it was named after the biblical city of Ai, while others believe that it was named after one of its founders, Ami Richards. The story continues Ami was a man, so others dropped the 'M' from his name to make the town's name more masculine. Ai has been noted for its short place name. A post office was established at Ai in 1846, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1903.

Stanisław of Masovia (pl: Stanisław mazowiecki; 17 May 1501 – 8 August 1524), was a Polish prince member of the House of Piast in the Masovian branch. He was a Duke of Czersk, Warsaw, Liw, Zakroczym and Nur during 1503-1524 (under regency until 1518) jointly with his brother. He was the eldest son of Konrad III the Red and his third wife Anna, a daughter of Mikolaj Radziwiłł the Old, Voivod of Vilnius and the first Grand Chancellor of Lithuania. Life After the death of their father on 28 October 1503, Stanisław and his younger brother Janusz III inherited his domains but, because they were minors, remained under the regency of their mother. Most of the Masovian inheritance (except Czersk, which had already been given to Konrad III as a hereditary fief in 1495) was seriously threatened by the Kingdom of Poland at the time of Konrad III's death, and was not secured in his sons' hands until 14 March 1504, when by a ruling of King Alexander, the young princes received their whole patrimony as a fief. Stanisław and his brother took the government in 1518, because of the constant riots of the local nobility. Despite this, Anna Radziwiłł retained the real power in Masovia until her death in 1522. In the same year when they attained their majority, both princes attended the wedding of King Sigismund I the Old to Bona Sforza in Kraków. Joint Seal of Stanisław and Janusz III. In 1519, fulfilling their duties as Polish vassals, Stanisław and Janusz III intervened in the Polish-Teutonic War, sending auxiliary troops to the Polish King, and in the winter of 1519-1520 they personally captured several towns in Masuria. At the same time, Stanisław secretly entered into talks with the Teutonic Knights for a ceasefire, which finally took place in December 1520, a few months before a peace treaty ended the war between Poland and the Teutonic Order. In their private lives, both Stanisław and his brother were heavily inclined to drink and women; however, in order to continue his bloodline, in 1523 Stanisław started negotiations for marriage with Princess Hedwig of Poland, only surviving daughter of King Sigismund I and his first wife, Barbara Zápolya. The wedding never took place; one year later, and likely as a result of his dissolute lifestyle, Stanisław died on 8 August 1524. He was buried at St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw. Last of the Masovian Piasts (from left to right): Janusz III (1503-1526), Stanisław (1500-1524) and Anna (1498-1557). The sudden death of Stanisław, and that two years later of his younger brother Janusz III, were considered suspicious at the time. The main suspect was a Płock lady called Katarzyna Radziejowska, who after being seduced and abandoned by both princes, was believed to have poisoned firstly Anna Radziwiłł, then Stanisław and finally Janusz III in revenge. Declared guilty, she and her supposed accomplice were tied naked to poles and beaten for hours, and finally burned alive. The hurry where the sentence was carried raised even more suspicion that in fact the real instigator of the crimes was Queen Bona. The controversy was so intense that King Sigismund I, in order to clarify the matter once and for all, ordered an investigation, as a result of which a special edict was declared on 9 February 1528 which ruled that the princes \\"weren't victims of a human hand, but was the will of the Almighty Lord that caused their deaths\\". According to Jan Długosz, the real cause of the death of both princes could be an inherited disease of the Masovian princes: tuberculosis.

Surgeons certified by the ABS, known as diplomates, have completed a minimum of five years of surgical residency training following medical school and successfully completed a written and oral examination process administered by the ABS. The ABS provides board certification in general surgery, vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, surgery of the hand, hospice and palliative medicine, and complex general surgical oncology. The ABS is composed of a board of directors representing the principal surgical organizations in the U.S. and is one of the 24 member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties.  History  The American Board of Surgery was officially organized on January 9, 1937. The formation of the ABS was the result of a committee formed a year earlier by the American Surgical Association with representatives from the American College of Surgeons, American Medical Association and the Southern, Western, Pacific Coast and New England Surgical Associations. The leaders of these organizations, including such figures as Drs. Edward Archibald, Evarts Ambrose Graham and Allen Whipple, had recognized for some time the need to differentiate well-trained surgeons who had limited their practice to surgery from doctors in general practice. They also felt that surgery as a field of medicine had matured into a full-time specialty.History of the American Board of Surgery: 1937-1952 Rodman, J. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, Co.; 1956:104 p. The committee established the basic principles for a national certifying body for surgeons practicing in the U.S. The committee decided that the ABS should be formed of members from the represented organizations and, once organized, it would establish a comprehensive certification process. These findings and recommendations were approved by the cooperating societies, leading to the board's formation in 1937. This was done to protect the public and improve the specialty.History of the American Board of Surgery: 1937-1952 Rodman, J. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, Co.; 1956:104 p.  Certification  Certification by the American Board of Surgery is a voluntary process, meant to designate individuals who have met the highest standards of education, training and knowledge in surgery. Board certification is different from medical licensure, which is required by law for an individual to practice medicine. Upon completion of training at an accredited U.S. or Canadian residency program, a surgeon may apply to the ABS for certification. The applicant's training and operative experience are reviewed by the ABS, and the director of the training program must also attest to the applicant's professionalism and ethics, as well as surgical skills. If these are all satisfactory, the applicant is admitted to the ABS examinations required for certification. Upon successful completion of these examinations, the surgeon becomes a diplomate of the ABS. Certification in general surgery is a prerequisite for certification in pediatric surgery, surgical critical care, surgery of the hand, hospice and palliative medicine, and complex general surgical oncology.  Maintenance of certification  To maintain certification, diplomates must demonstrate ongoing professionalism and commitment to continuing medical education (through seminars, lectures, reading of journals) and pass a written examination. The ABS is currently transitioning from recertification at 10-year intervals to Maintenance of Certification (MOC), a broader professional development program with more frequent requirements for learning and assessment during the 10-year certification cycle.

Early life and education Charles Hogg was born on a farm near Point Pleasant, Mason County, Virginia (now West Virginia) on December 21, 1852. He attended the new public schools at Locust Grove, then traveled west for studies at Carleton College in Racine, Ohio. Hogg graduated from Oldham & Hawe's Business College in Pomeroy, Ohio in 1869. Career Hogg returned to Mason County, where he taught school and worked as a bookkeeper from 1870 to 1873. He also read law, possibly under Henry J. Fisher, whom he greatly admired, and who had one of the largest law libraries in the new state. Hogg was admitted to the bar in 1875 and entered practice in Point Pleasant, the county seat. In that same year he also served as county superintendent of free schools of Mason County from 1875 to 1879. Voters in the 4th Congressional district elected Hogg in 1886 to the 50th United States Congress (March 4, 1887 – March 3, 1889), but failed to win his party's renomination to that seat.

Near-semirings arise naturally from functions on monoids.  Definition  A near-semiring is a set S with two binary operations \\"+\\" and \\"·\\", and a constant 0 such that (S, +, 0) is a monoid (not necessarily commutative), (S, ·) is a semigroup, these structures are related by a single (right or left) distributive law, and accordingly 0 is a one-sided (right or left, respectively) absorbing element. Formally, an algebraic structure (S, +, ·, 0) is said to be a near-semiring if it satisfies the following axioms: # (S, +, 0) is a monoid, # (S, ·) is a semigroup, # (a + b) · c = a · c + b · c, for all a, b, c in S, and # 0 · a = 0 for all a in S. Near-semirings are a common abstraction of semirings and near-rings [Golan, 1999; Pilz, 1983]. The standard examples of near-semirings are typically of the form M(Г), the set of all mappings on a monoid (Г; +, 0), equipped with composition of mappings, pointwise addition of mappings, and the zero function. Subsets of M(Г) closed under the operations provide further examples of near-semirings. Another example is the ordinals under the usual operations of ordinal arithmetic (here Clause 3 should be replaced with its symmetric form c · (a + b) = c · a + c · b. Strictly speaking, the class of all ordinals is not a set, so the above example should be more appropriately called a class near-semiring. We get a near-semiring in the standard sense if we restrict to those ordinals strictly less than some multiplicatively indecomposable ordinal.

The legal status of Texas is the standing of Texas as a political entity. While Texas has been part of various political entities throughout its history, including 10 years during 1836–1846 as the independent Republic of Texas, the current legal status is as a state of the United States of America. Due to Texas's unique history, United States sovereignty over Texas has been disputed at times. Adherents of secessionist movements claim that American sovereignty is illegal, although this viewpoint is not widely held. Disputes over the legal status of Texas have revolved around key issues that include, but are not limited to, the legitimacy of its re-admittance to the Union following the Civil War, differing viewpoints over its de facto and de jure international standing, and perceived discrepancies between its original and current boundaries. Regardless, a minority viewpoint, as expressed by some factions such as Republic of Texas (group), has persisted, asserting that Texas remains an independent nation and that American actions in the American Civil War have resulted in an illegal military occupation of Texas. The debate is considered by some to resemble academic discourse being argued by several other activist groups in the United States, most notably arguments over the legal status of Hawaii and the legal status of Alaska.Enriquez, J. The United States of America: Polarization, Fracturing, and Our Future. Crown Publishing, Mathson, S and Lorenzen, M.G.

Volume 15, 2008 (1/2): 211–230. published online: 11 Oct 2008. The situation most closely resembles that of Hawaii, as Hawaii was also annexed via a Joint Resolution of Congress. History Prior to the revolution that resulted in the creation of the Republic of Texas in 1836, the area now included in the State of Texas was part of Mexico. On March 1, 1845, the US enacted a congressional joint resolution proposing the annexation of Texas to the United States (Joint Resolution for annexing Texas to the United States, J.Res. 8, enacted March 1, 1845, ). On June 23, 1845, the Texan Congress accepted the US Congress's joint resolution, and consented to President Jones' calling of a convention to be held on July 4, 1845. A Texas convention debated the annexation offer and almost unanimously passed an ordinance assenting to it on July 4, 1845. The convention debated through August 28, and adopted the Constitution of the State of Texas on August 27, 1845. On December 29, 1845, the United States admitted the State of Texas to the Union (Joint Resolution for the admission of the state of Texas into the Union, J.Res. 1, enacted December 29, 1845, ). On February 1, 1861, a special convention in Texas adopted an ordinance of secession repealing the ordinance of annexation and seceding from the United States (by 95% vote, 166 to 8), and on February 7, the Legislature ordered a public referendum to be held on the ordinance under the direction of the convention. An Act to provide for submitting the Ordinance of Secession to a vote of the People, approved February 7, 1861. On February 23, 1861, citizens of Texas voted overwhelmingly to secede from the United States, by 75% as 46,153 to 14,747.\\"Secession\\". Handbook of Texas Online. paragraphs 7–9. During the American Civil War, Texas was invaded by Union troops many times including the final major clash of the war which was the Battle of Palmito Ranch, on May 12–13, 1865. On June 17, 1865, President Andrew Johnson appointed Andrew Jackson Hamilton as the provisional civilian governor of the state and directed him to convene a constitutional convention restricted to loyal Americans.Presidential Proclamation No. 42, 17 June 1865, On March 15, 1866, the convention enacted an ordinance repealing the ordinance of secession. A referendum was held on June 25, 1866, pursuant to the laws then in force on March 29, for the ratification of the amendments proposed by the convention. In March 1867 under the More Efficient Government of the Rebel States established under the first of the Reconstruction Acts, by General Orders No. 10, Gen. Philip Sheridan was appointed military governor of the Fifth Military District.An Act to provide for the more efficient Government of the Rebel States, enacted March 2, 1867, General Orders: 10, March 11, 1867 In February 1869 the Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. White that the secession had been illegal, that the Union was insoluble by actions of a state, and that states therefore did not have the right to secede. Historical legal actions The political status of Texas has been questioned legally at various times subsequent to its re-admittance to the Union. Two landmark Supreme Court decisions set the prevailing precedent on the status of Texas. *Texas v. White, United States Supreme Court, (1869) :In 1869, the Supreme Court ruled that secession of Texas from the United States was illegal. The court wrote, \\"The Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.\\" The court did allow some possibility of the divisibility \\"through revolution, or through consent of the States.\\"Aleksandar Pavković, Peter Radan, Creating New States: Theory and Practice of Secession, p. 222, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007, .Texas v. White, 74 U.S. 700 (1869) at Cornell University Law School Supreme Court collection. *DeLima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901) :Annexation via a joint resolution of Congress is legal. The Supreme Court wrote, \\"A treaty made by that power is said to be the supreme law of the land, as efficacious as an act of Congress; and, if subsequent and inconsistent with an act of Congress, repeals it. This must be granted, and also that one of the ordinary incidents of a treaty is the cession of territory, and that the territory thus acquired is acquired as absolutely as if the annexation were made, as in the case of Texas and Hawaii, by an act of Congress.\\"  Recent legal actions This section deals primarily with modern theoretical arguments regarding Texas' de jure status under certain interpretations of international law, a focal point of modern assertions regarding alternate viewpoints on Texas' established legal status as a state of the United States of America. These arguments are illustrated in legal actions brought by proponents of these viewpoints. =Colorado case= In January 2004, Timothy Paul Kootenay, in jail in Aspen, Colorado, claimed that the state of Colorado had no jurisdiction to extradite him to California on a probation warrant, on the grounds that he was a citizen of the Republic of Texas. He claimed that the sliver of land which contains Aspen was a part of the original Republic of Texas and, as such, he was not a citizen of the United States. His claim was rejected by the courts.Sheperd, (January 21, 2004). Weird News. The Anchorage Press, Vol. 13, Ed. 2 =Richard McLaren: Petition to the International Court of Justice and in U.S. District Court= In 1995, a petition was filed with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, The Netherlands, by Richard L. McLaren asking that the Republic of Texas be declared to still exist. The clerk at the International Court of Justice declined to file the case and replied > I have to inform you, however, that the function of the International Court > of Justice is confined to the settling, in accordance with international > law, of legal disputes submitted to it by States, and to the rendering of > advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by duly authorized > international organs and agencies.

The Republic of Texas is No More: An Answer to the Claim that Texas was Unconstitutionally Annexed to the United States. 28 Texas Tech Law Review 679. A descriptive handbook published in 2004 by the International Court of Justice states that \\"Only States may be parties to cases before the Court\\" and the Court will only decide disputes which are \\"submitted to it by States.\\" Regarding these types of petitions, the International Court of Justice handbook states: > Hardly a day passes without the Registry receiving written or oral > applications from private persons.

McLaren was ultimately unsuccessful in his effort. He filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which stated in its decision on April 30, 1998, \\"Despite plaintiffs' argument ... [i]n 1845, Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America. The Republic of Texas no longer exists.\\"McLaren v. United States Incorporated, 2 F. Supp. 2d 48 (D.D.C. 1998), at .

Hucles served as the Women's Sports Foundation President, effective January 1, 2015 to January 2017. She has become a regular speaker on topics of sports leadership, equality, inclusion and safe spaces, anti-bullying, and the power of sport and its impact on personal growth and development. She is a member of the Advisory Board for You Can Play, a campaign dedicated to fighting homophobia in sports. Early life Hucles attended Norfolk Academy where she was a Parade and NSCAA All-American selection in 1995. She was twice named an All-State and All-Region selection in 1994 and 1995. She graduated in 1996 as Norfolk Academy's all-time leading scorer with 204 goals and 106 assists. =University of Virginia= Hucles played college soccer at the University of Virginia, where she was a four-year all-ACC player and tallied 59 goals, including a record 19 game-winners. She is still Virginia's career women's leader in goals, game-winning goals, and total points. Playing career =Club= After graduating from Virginia in 2000, Hucles played for Hampton Roads Piranhas of the W-League. She led the league in assists with seven, playing in 14 games and scoring six goals. Hucles was then drafted in the 2001 WUSA Inaugural Draft in the 12th round (93rd overall) by the Boston Breakers of the newly formed Women's United Soccer Association. She went on to make 57 total appearances for the club, scoring six goals. She scored the first goal in the history of the organization on March 6, 2001, in a preseason exhibition against the Duke Blue Devils. In her first season, Hucles appeared in 21 games, starting 19 of them, and finished with two goals and no assists. In 2002, Hucles appeared in 19 games, starting 17, and finished with three goals and four assists. In 2003, Hucles appeared in 17 games, all starts, and scored one goal and assisted on four more. After the 2003 season, the WUSA ceased operations. Hucles returned to a club in 2005 when she turned out for the Boston Renegades. She only appeared in five games in 2005 but notched three goals and an assist. In 2006, Hucles had a much more productive season, appearing in 11 games and tallying 10 goals and two assists. In 2008, Women's Professional Soccer was established. Hucles, along with US National Team players Kristine Lilly and Heather Mitts, were allocated to the new Boston Breakers on September 16, 2006. The league kicked off in 2009, which saw Hucles appear in 19 games, all starts, and score two goals and an assist. Following the conclusion of the season, on October 16, 2009, Hucles abruptly announced her retirement from both club and international soccer. =International= With the United States Women's National Team, Hucles won two Olympic gold medals and finished third in two World Cups. She made her first appearance for the United States on April 27, 2002, against Finland. She went on to appear in 109 total matches for the United States, with her last appearance on July 22, 2009, against Canada. Hucles was a member of the U.S. squad at the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup but did not play in the tournament due to a shin injury. She was a member of the gold medal-winning United States team for the 2004 Summer Olympics, appearing in two games in Athens. At the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, she was a member of the USA squad but did not get any playing time. However, her biggest role with the United States came in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Hucles was expected to play a backup role with the squad, but an injury to Abby Wambach forced Hucles into a starting position. She responded by scoring four goals, including two against Japan in the semi-finals. Her efforts helped the United States to the gold medal, and she finished second only to Cristiane in goals scored. On October 16, 2009, Hucles announced her retirement from both club and international soccer. Public diplomacy In April 2014, Hucles traveled to Morocco as a SportsUnited Sports Envoy for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, she worked with Lesle Gallimore and Marian Dalmy to conduct soccer clinics and events for 104 youth from under-served areas. In so doing, Hucles helped contribute to SportsUnited's mission to promote greater international understanding and inclusion through sport.

Sexual: Conjugation to form a hypnozygote. The Closterium peracerosum-strigosum-littorale (C. psl) complex is a unicellular, isogamous charophycean alga group that is the closest unicellular relative to land plants. These algae are capable of forming two types of dormant diploid zygospores. Some populations form zygospores within single clones of cells (homothallic), whereas others form zygospores between different clones of cells (heterothallic). The heterothallic strains have two mating types, mt(-) and mt(+). When cells of opposite mating types are mixed in a nitrogen- deficient mating medium, mt(-) and mt(+) cells pair with each other and release protoplasts. This release is then followed by protoplast fusion (conjugation) leading to formation of a diploid zygospore. Sex pheromones termed protoplast-release inducing proteins produced by mt(-) and mt(+) cells facilitate this process. A homothallic strain of Closterium forms selfing zygospores via the conjugation of two sister gametangial cells derived from one vegetative cell. Conjugation in the homothallic strain occurs mainly at low cell density and is regulated by an ortholog of a heterothallic sex- specific pheromone. Although self-fertilization employs meiosis, it produces minimal genetic variability. Homothallism is thus a form of sex that is unlikely to be adaptively maintained by a benefit related to producing variability. However, homothallic meiosis may be maintained in Closterium peracerosum as an adaptation for surviving under stressful conditions such as growth in nitrogen depleted media at low cell density. A proposed adaptive benefit of meiosis is the promotion of homologous recombinational repair of DNA damages that can be caused by a stressful environment  References   External links  = Scientific references = = Scientific databases = AlgaTerra database * Index Nominum Genericorum Desmidiales Charophyta genera ","title":"Closterium"},{"id":"13202419","title":"Tommy Faragher"},{"id":"13202425","text":"Cosmarium is a genus of fresh water organisms belonging to the Charophyta, a division of green algae from which the land plants (Embryophyta) emerged.See the NCBI webpage on Cosmarium.

Several fossil species and genera are known. Unlike some related currently recognized families, the Nemastomatidae are monophyletic. (2007): Nemastomatidae. Simon, 1872. In: Pinto-da-Rocha et al. 2007: 148ff Description Members of the Nemastomatidae range in body length from about one to almost six millimeters. Their chelicerae are of normal proportions, but the pedipalps are very elongated and thin in some groups. Leg length is likewise variable. Distribution The subfamily Ortholasmatinae (ten species in two genera) occur on both sides of the Pacific Ocean: in western North America from Mexico to British Columbia and eastern Asia (Japan and northern Thailand. The other subfamily, Nemastomatinae, occur all over Europe up to Iceland and the Caucasus, in the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, from Anatolia to northern Iran, with a few species found outside this region, in Central Asia and the Himalayas. Most species are restricted to very small mountainous southern regions. Relationships The Nemastomatidae are probably a sister group to the genera Dicranolasma (Dicranolasmatidae) and Trogulus (Trogulidae). Name The genus name Nemastoma is a combination of Ancient Greek nema \\"thread\\" and stoma \\"mouth\\", referring to the elongated pedipalps.

Data extracted from the Morphology  Desmidium is one of the filamentous desmid genera characterized by rather firm intercellular connections. Cells connect to adjoining cells at the flat, apical face of the cells. The cells can be longer or shorter than wide. A median constriction of the cells may appear either as distinct or faint. Desmidium cell walls are smooth with multiple side-by-side or scattered pores. Every semicell contains one stellate chloroplast. Typically cells are oval in shape or have a three to five angle. Angles of the cell are often offbalance on each semicell. This creates a helical shape of angles throughout the filament. Cells may have either a pyrenoid (transparent structure) in each of its lobes or a single pyrenoid in the middle of the cell. The nucleus is found in the conjoined area of semicells (isthmus). . After cell division daughter cells stick together so that the filament in question increases in length. Moreover, cell filaments are markedly twisted, to be seen from a gradual shift in position of the cellular lobe facing the observer. In case of conjugation (almost) all cells in the paired filaments are sexually activated, resulting in a series of zygospores coupling the empty cell filaments * The genus name of Desmidium - derived from the Greek word 'desmos'(= ribbon, chain or bond) - presumably gave rise to the family name of Desmidiaceae.

He was known as \\"St. William Grant\\", \\"St.\\" presumably meaning \\"Sergeant\\" in reference to his military or UNIA service. He is regarded as the person who started the struggle of the working class in Jamaica. Understanding that as an uneducated black man he would never win the respect of the Colonial Government, he entrusted Alexander Bustamante with the responsibility of taking the struggles of the working class to the next level. Early life Grant was born at Brandon Hill in rural St Andrew. He attended St Phillips Church School in St Andrew and West Branch Elementary School in Kingston. As a young man he became a dockworker in Kingston. With the advent of World War I he stowed away on a British troop ship, subsequently joining the Eleventh British West India Regiment. After the war he returned briefly to Jamaica before emigrating to New York in 1920. There he worked as a cook in restaurants while involved with the Tiger division of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League(UNIA). Activism In 1934 he served as a delegate to the UNIA convention in Jamaica, where he was expelled from UNIA by Marcus Garvey himself for \\"misrepresenting the aims and objectives of the organisation\\". Remaining in Jamaica, Grant continued both to earn his living as a cook and participate in activism, this time as a labour leader. In May 1938 the dockworkers of the United Fruit Company were on strike. Bustamante and Grant were known as orators promoting and directing the strike. Both were arrested on 24 May, and remanded in custody by a police inspector. While Bustamante submitted to arrest, St. William Grant protested and was badly beaten. Both were charged with inciting unlawful assembly and obstructing the police, were refused bail and as a form of humiliation were stripped down to their underwear. The events led to further strikes and riots, until Bustamante and Grant were freed by a court on 28 May.Dr. Rebecca Tortello, \\"The Founding Of The BITU & The JLP\\", Jamaica Gleaner, 9 September 2002. According to Dr Orville Taylor, a senior lecturer at the University of the West Indies, \\"had it not been for St. William Grant, history might not have known Bustamante\\". Grant had a falling out with Bustamante and never became part of the Jamaica Labour Party. In 1947 he contested the West Kingston division for the People's National Party in the first Municipal (KSAC) elections after adult suffrage and was beaten by more than 2 to 1. He never resurfaced in any other political contest. However, in 1950 Bustamante recommended that Grant be appointed watchman at the central Housing Authority (later the Ministry of Housing) in which post he remained until his death.Robert A Hill (ed.), Marcus Garvey and Universal Negro Improvement Association Papers: November 1927-August 1940, vol. 7, 1992, . Honours Grant was awarded the Order of Distinction on National Heroes Day, 1974. Following this, the UNIA organised a special tribute for him on 21 December 1974. He was given a state funeral on 5 September 1977.

The Ebb is the outgoing phase, when the tide drains away from the shore; and the flow is the incoming phase when water rises again. The terms are also common in figurative use. In Hydroponics Ebb and Flow is a form of hydroponics that is known for its simplicity, reliability of operation and low initial investment cost. Pots are filled with an inert medium which does not function like soil or contribute nutrition to the plants but which anchors the roots and functions as a temporary reserve of water and solvent mineral nutrients. The hydroponic solution alternately floods the system and is allowed to ebb away. Under this system a water-tight growing bed (table), pots that are placed in the table will hold the medium. The medium can consist of material that the root system can reach the level ebb reaches. A medium can consist of lava rock, rockwool cubes, and fiber. A mixture of these different types of medium can absorb the moister more evenly and efficiently. this is periodically flooded for a short period (5 to 10 minutes) with a nutrient solution pumped from a supply tank. By placing the nutrient solution supply tank below the growing bed, the nutrient solution can drain back by gravity. This hydroponic growing system can be very effective for any size plants depending on space. The method is inefficient in its use of water and plant nutrient reagents. Root disease occurrence and nutrient element insufficiency can occur without repeated use of the solution without proper oxygenation on the tables that are flooded. Because it is a \\"closed” system, the re-circulated nutrient solution will require monitoring every time the system flows back the reservoir for pH and PPM. Within the growing period, the nutrient solution may require replacement. The rooting medium will require washing to remove root debris and accumulated precipitates as well as sterilization before reuse. =Principles of Operation= The fundamental principle of hydroponics relies on fertilized and aerated water which provides both nutrition and oxygen to a plant's root zone. It often involves relatively sophisticated mechanization processes which can be daunting to casual hobbyists. Nutrient solutions must usually be below the temperature at which pathogen growth can begin, yet not so cool that root activity is suppressed. Active aeration of the fertilizer solution is common, since root systems themselves remove oxygen, creating conditions which also can promote pathogenic bacteria and water-borne molds. E&F; utilizes the fact that the solution is not left in constant contact with the roots of plants, to avoid the need for oxygenating or chilling of the solution. Instead it relies on characteristics of root function to provide passive oxygenation at a high level which tends to suppress pathogen growth. Simplicity is maintained through usage of a single, two-directional path for the solution. Water flows in and out using the same tube. When the pump has raised water into the tray, briefly submerging the roots, the pump is rendered inactive using a switch, typically a timer, and the water flows back down the same tube. This eliminates the need for more than one sealed fitting and reduces overall complexity of the system. Ebb and flow systems come on according to the water- holding capacity of the medium in which the roots sit. Highly water-retentive media can require watering only once a day, while others require two to as many as six floodings, with each \\"flood\\" stage only lasting a few minutes. The time it takes to flood the roots is not a critical parameter, which means that pumps are often moderate in capacity and can be small for systems sustaining indoor plants. This makes the method popular with amateur and urban gardeners. Gravity acts as drain pump, and aeration is accomplished through thin-filming and positive displacement of air as it is forced out of the root zone by water. =Aeration in Ebb and Flood Systems= Aeration of an ebb and flood system is an important aspect of its operation. Automatic displacement eliminates air which has been de-oxygenated by the roots as the water rises to its highest flood stage. When the pump turns off, gravity pulls the water downwards, which re-exposes the space around the roots to the air. The film of water left around the roots during ebb has a high surface-to-mass ratio, which means that even as the roots absorb oxygen, its high surface area facilitates re-oxygenation, which can sustain the roots as long as their surfaces remain damp. The high oxygen content of water filmed in this way suppresses most harmful lifeforms, keeping the root zones disease free. In other types of hydroponics this function must be performed by cooling the solution to protect it from pythium, a form of water mold responsible for a condition called 'root rot', in which the outer cells of the roots die, turn brown and slough off when handled. Need for supplementary oxygenation using air pumps is also eliminated, which increases reliability and reduces complexity. Ebb and flow hydroponic systems are also quiet, while using less power than other hydroponic systems, which means that they can be used in environments where acoustic signature and excessive plumbing is objectionable, such as residential or classroom applications where space is at a premium. =Drawbacks to E&F; Systems= Ebb and flow systems are flexible, with few practical drawbacks. Though typically known for compact cultivation of plants having smaller stature, it has been used for growing large plants, using buckets ranging in size from 1 gallon to 5 gallons, making use of high-volume pumps such as those in large aquariums, decorative fountains and koi ponds. There are facets to these systems that present some labor investment in large- scale applications. These are primarily management of media between uses, such as washing and sterilization. This can be done by dumping into the tray and filling with a sterilizing solution such as hydrogen peroxide or chlorine solution, temporarily plugging the drain, with hand removal of root fragments. Larger containers require transferring the media to a suitable surface after sterilization to permit removal of leftover plant material. A second drawback is that the roots tend to grow together, meaning removal of harvested or damaged plants can be somewhat problematic in plants having well-developed root systems. Commercial crops harvested at one time are somewhat immune to concerns related to that aspect of the system, but in the event of pathogenic invasion the problem can quickly spread, as all the roots share the same flood source. Also, most ebb and flow systems use a recycling reservoir to flood the table. Over a period of time the pH of the nutrient solution may fluctuate to a range which is unhealthy for the plant. If the pH is not corrected, various problems may occur, including but not limited to poor nutrient absorption and leaf cannibalization. As the name implies, leaf cannibalization occurs as the plant takes nutrients from one part of the plant and uses those nutrients in a different part of the plant. Leaf cannibalization appears as yellow or brown spots on leaves. During Flower pH rises quite a bit each day. It is best to adjust first thing and last thing each day. Also, during Flower nutrients and water absorption increases, while root exudate gets carried back to the reservoir. This causes ppms to increase significantly. Proper control requires routine checking and replacing with fresh nutrients ~ 5 days to avoid toxicity. Since the plant(s) is being fed several times a day, lower ppm nutrients (600–800) are sufficient. Pushing with higher ppms can cause the plant to burn up from the inside, especially when significant water evaporation/usage causes the remaining nutrient concentration to increase beyond 1500 ppms. Choosing a medium like lava rock is ideal for flood and drain in that it drains quickly, and due to its rough texture, it traps small amounts of oxygen and nutrients which keeps the root zone moist between feedings. Also, because it drains quickly, the number of feedings can be increased to roughly every 45–60 minutes during lights on, producing explosive growth. Should the grower opt for this method, the nutrient ppm should be kept below 800, better still 600. Poor drainage, or incomplete drainage, may cause a condition wherein dense roots are exposed to stagnant water which is trapped by the root mass. Root rot and fungal growth are the most common result of stagnant water. Some E&F; systems are not as immune to root rot as a well- designed system would be. In tables where plants are larger than optimal for the system, this can create the need for modifications such as screens or beds of medium-sized gravel to prevent standing water. Tilting the tray is one way to achieve better drain characteristics. In bucket E&F; this problem can be dealt with in a similar manner, ensuring good drainage through using medium of adequate size and ensuring that drainage of the container between flood cycles is complete. Hydrogen peroxide is also added to nutrient solutions when there is suspicion that the anaerobic pythium root rot mold has begun to proliferate on the roots' surfaces. The oxygen liberated from the hydrogen peroxide is destructive to single-celled organisms and is administered in dosages which vary with the concentration of the peroxide. Typically several tablespoons or more of 3.5% peroxide solution per gallon of water are used. The temporary rise in the oxygen level is only minimally damaging to roots, while eradicating the water-borne mold can significantly increase yield or even save a crop's viability.

After evaluating aircraft from Europe and the United States, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force selected a new design by the domestic Nakajima Aircraft Company. The prototype was test flow in May 1934. The Nakajima Ki-4 was a biplane design with staggered wings and fixed divided landing gear. It was powered by one Nakajima Ha-8, nine- cylinder, air-cooled radial engine. Maximum speed was and maximum take-off weight .

The maximum bomb load was . A total of 516 units were produced, 333 by Nakajima between March 1934 and February 1939, and 57 under license by Tachikawa Aircraft Company Ltd and another 126 by Manshū in Manchukuo (Manchuria). Operational history The first Ki-4s began equipping Imperial Japanese Army Air Force units in 1935 and were an active part of Japanese fighter squadrons for a number of years thereafter. The Ki-4s saw substantial service in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1938. They also functioned as light ground-attack aircraft in the support of advancing Japanese ground troops. However, these biplanes were vulnerable to even the oldest and slowest moving enemy fighters. By the time of the entry of Japan into World War II, the Ki-4s were regarded as obsolete. A number were still retained for use in the supply and liaison role from 1941, and others were transferred to the Manchukuo Air Force, but those that had not been lost in service served briefly as elementary trainers or target tugs before being scrapped. All of the Ki-4s were removed from active service by 1943. Two Ki-4s were tested as seaplanes, one with twin floats and the other with one main and two stabilizing floats, but neither version was placed into production.

Bacamarte, a Brazil-born Portuguese (when Brazil was a colony), is a prominent physician whose sincere obsession for discovering a universal method to cure pathological disorders drives inhabitants of the small Brazilian town of Itaguaí to fear, conspiracy, and revolutionary attempts. ;Chapters 1–4 In a short space of time, Bacamarte's newly opened asylum, popularly named \\"the Green House\\" (Casa Verde), passes to take inside of its walls not only mentally ill patients but also healthy citizens who, according to the doctor's diagnoses, are about to develop some sort of mental illness. ;Chapters 5–10 Porfírio, the town's barber, indicts Bacamarte for his corruptive influence over the Municipal Council, which since the beginning approved the experiments taken place at the Green House, \\"the Bastille of human Knowledge\\". A revolt and council change ensues, but the new regime proposes an alliance to the alienist, until being toppled back to the original council. The local priest also misquotes Dante. ;Chapters 11–12 This gives pause to Bacamarte, who changes his tack and decides that balanced people are actually a small minority, and thus the anomaly that should be cured: the modest, the loyal, the wise, the patient, etc., are now admitted to be scientifically disequilibrated according to his new theory. ;Chapter 13 After they all have been \\"cured\\" and discharged, Bacamarte eventually considers that he is the most well-balanced person of the village and thus the one most in need of treatment.

Fjestad - Initial specimens used surplus military parts with some modifications in order to consume the stock of parts, though further modifications were made as production progressed and later rifles were produced from newly manufactured parts. Most early rifles were in the military .30-06 calibre used in the M1917 but it became available in a variety of chamberings. It was the first high-powered bolt-action sporting rifle produced by Remington. Design The action was a modified Mauser design with dual front locking lugs and a rear safety lug where the base of the bolt handle fitted into a recess in the receiver. The action was large, strong and robust, and therefore ideally suited to powerful sporting cartridges under development. The action used an internal box magazine and the Mauser-type claw extractor for controlled round feeding for excellent reliability. The barrel used on initial versions was of the same shape as the original military one, except it was polished and deep blued. The trigger mechanism was initially the same two-stage military type. Remington used the same steel and heat treatment as for the M1917 rifles, although improving the dimensional tolerances and the standard of finish. The actions were proof- tested to breech pressure.  History  In 1918, after the end of World War I and termination of contracts for both the P14 and M1917, Remington was left with two factories (the main factory at Ilion and a subsidiary at Eddystone) tooled up to make the M1917, and was also left with a large inventory of stored spare parts.p152 Bolt Action Rifles Frank de Haas, DBI Books Ltd, Northfield Illinois, 1971 It was decided to make a sporting version of the P14-M1917 model rifles at the Ilion plant. In 1921, Remington introduced the Model 30 High Power sporting rifle in caliber 30-06 Springfield. Early models differed from the military rifles by deleting the prominent rear sight protection ears and machining the receiver bridge to the same diameter as the receiver ring, and straightening the floorplate. These changes made for a better-looking rifle but magazine capacity was reduced from 6 to 5 rounds. The barrel was of the military profile but shortened slightly to 24\\". The barreled action was placed into a sporter type stock of plain American black walnut with a schnabel fore-end and a steel buttplate grooved to prevent slipping. A simple receiver aperture sight was fitted to the receiver bridge by a dovetail. This sight was soon discontinued and replaced with one mounted further forward on the barrel band. The Mauser-type cock-on-closing feature, and the double-stage military-type trigger were retained. In 1926, the stock was refined with a higher and thicker comb. A crossbolt was added, and checkering of the pistol grip and fore-end became standard. There was a deluxe Model 30S made 1930–32 with a better designed and chequered stock, a Lyman 48 receiver type sight called Model 30 Express. In 1932–33 some substantial changes were made. The action was changed to cock as the bolt handle was lifted, and the trigger was altered to a short, single-stage pull.p153 Bolt Action Rifles Frank de Haas DBI Books, Northfield IL, USA, 1971 The Enfield- type cock-on-closing feature used until that time had been carried over from the original P14 and M1917 rifles, and was originally intended to facilitate rapid fire as the action heated up. However, this was unnecessary on a sporting rifle and the Mauser M98 and M1903 Springfield type cock-on-opening bolt was preferred by American sportsmen, so the action was changed accordingly. Other changes for 1932 were that the designations changed for the Model 30A (ex-M30), the Model 30R (carbine) was added, and a floating barrel was introduced instead of the earlier bedding system where the barrel contacted the front end of the stock. By 1939 all receivers were drilled and tapped to accept a receiver sight. Production stopped in 1940 with the introduction of the Model 720.p154 Bolt Action Rifles Frank de Haas DBI Books, Northfield IL, USA, 1971 The 720 was the final improvement of the original Enfield action by Remington, and was only produced for a few years. It was replaced in 1948 by the much-simplified Model 721 and 722 rifles, which were developed eventually into the widely used Model 700 rifles that are still in production today.  Production  The Model 30 had a 24-inch barrel, and was available in .30-06 Springfield only (1921–1925)- S/N between 00001 and 30600. About 3000 units were manufactured.\\"Remington Model 30 Production A carbine version with a 20-inch barrel was produced from 1924 to 1925, also available only in .30-06 Springfield. Both of these models were replaced in 1926 by the upgraded Model 30 Express version. The Model 30 Express version was available in several configurations - The basic 30A with its 22-inch barrel, was offered in calibers .30-06 Springfield, .25 Rem, .30 Rem, .32 Rem, .35 Rem, 7mm Mauser, .257 Roberts. On these guns, the aperture receiver sight was omitted, and replaced with a more conventional rear sight mounted on the barrel. The rifles were also available in more expensive grades; The Deluxe or \\"Special\\" 30S which in 1930 became the Model 30SL, the 30SR with Redfield Optics sight, the 30SX, with a Lyman sight, and the 30SM with Marble-Goss aperture receiver sight. These \\"Special\\" models were available with 22 or 24 inches barrel, selected stock, One variation the Model 30R Carbine was introduced in 1927 with a 20 inches barrel, and was available in .25 Rem, .30 Rem, .32 Rem, .35 Rem and 30-06 caliber. The Express 30 family and its variant were manufactured in number of approximatively 22800 units, between 1926 and 1940.

The castle is located north of the River Bollin and south of a deep ravine (). History Substantial dating evidence has not been recovered from the site, but the form of the castle as a timber motte-and-bailey would date it to between the Norman Conquest and the 13th century.Redhead (1997), p. 35. The lack of documentary evidence relating to the castle may be attributed to the short term nature of the timber construction; motte-and-baileys were quick to establish and would not necessarily have been used for long periods. A coin found on the site dating to the reign of Henry II, 1154 to 1189, may indicate that the castle was built during this period. The castle most likely belonged to Hamo de Mascy who was involved with the barons' rebellion against Henry II in 1173. The castle had fallen out of use by the 13th century.

John Plant examined both of these ethnological phenomena among the Plains Indians, in particular the following tribes: * Sioux * Cheyenne * Comanche * Pawnee * Arikaree * Hidatsa * Absarokee * Ponca. The contraries of the Plains Indians were individuals devoted to an extraordinary life-style in which they consistently and continually did the opposite of what others normally do. They thus turned all conventions to their opposites (Heyoka, p. 10). While the clowns represented ceremonial figures and their performances were restricted to rituals, dances and ceremonies, the contraries practiced day and night a contrary lifestyle: thus on a certain level the contrary acted as an antagonist to his own people.

The character's name is a common hypocoristic form of Dumitru or Dimitrie (Romanian for Demetrius). He is one of the best-known figures in Caragiale's 1901 collection Momente şi schiţe, as well as in Romanian humor at large. Mitică is a male resident of Bucharest whose background and status are not always clear, generally seen as an allegory of the average Bucharester or through extension, inhabitants of Romania's southern regions—Wallachia and Muntenia. According to accounts, he was based on a resident of Sinaia, whom Caragiale had befriended. Caragiale used Mitică as a stock character to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, as well as inclinations to waste time and easily find his way out of problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers. On account of his caricature-like nature, Mitică survived in common reference beyond Caragiale's age. The character was portrayed by several actors, and most notably by Ştefan Iordache in the film De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?. In contemporary Romanian, his name was turned into a common noun, and often pluralized under the form mitici. During and after the 1990s, the terms surfaced in polemics surrounding Romania's centralism and the alternative projects for Transylvania's regional autonomy. In this context, it was used in reference to administrators from Bucharest or the Old Kingdom. In parallel, the term was adapted into a stereotype of modern Bucharesters and inhabitants of other regions over the Southern Carpathians, who are often portrayed as belonging to the Balkans, as opposed to the Central European traditions of Transylvania. Under these definitions, Mitică and mitici were notably present in essays authored by the Transylvanian activist Sabin Gherman. Eponymous sketch Ion Luca Caragiale in 1899, one year before he wrote Mitică Ion Luca Caragiale first introduced Mitică to his readers in an eponymous sketch of 1900, where he evidenced the character's universal traits and indicates that the first name is enough to define the character. Ion Luca Caragiale, Mitică (wikisource) The opening passage notably draws a parallel between Bucharest and Paris (at a time when the Romanian capital was colloquially known as \\"little Paris\\" or \\"Paris of the East\\"), and mentions Gambrinus, a pub owned and managed by the writer himself: > \\"Of course we all ought to know [Mitică]: we bump into him so very often—in > shops, in the trolley, in the tram car, on a bicycle, in the train wagon, at > the restaurant, at Gambrinus—in short, everywhere. > Mitică is the Bucharester par excellence. And given that Bucharest is a > little Paris, Mitică himself is, obviously, a little Parisian. > He is neither young nor old, neither handsome nor ugly, he is so so; he is a > lad whose features are all balanced; but that which sets him apart, that > which makes him have a marked character is his original and inventive > spirit.\\" With sarcasm, Caragiale proceeds to indicate that the character's main trait is his inventive use of Romanian and his tendency to coin terms and make jokes, with which \\"First and foremost, our little Parisian astounds the provincials\\". The remainder of the sketch lists Mitică's remarks, part of which are platitudes or clichés. Some of them are isolated observations, which the author defines as \\"sentimental, lyrical, and melancholic\\": \\"The most beautiful girl can only offer what she has to offer\\", \\"Life is a dream, death is an awakening\\", and \\"Every rose has its thorn\\". Most of Mitică's lines are comebacks in dialogue, and Caragiale notes that his character takes pride in \\"being unrivaled\\" when it comes to these. The writer implicates himself in the story, portraying himself as his character's good friend and a main target for such remarks—for instance, he recounts that, soon after New Year's Eve 1900, Mitică pretended not to have recognized him because \\"it's been a century since we last saw each other!\\" He writes how, when he was ordering a ţuica in the presence of Mitică, the latter jokingly asked the bartender not to comply, \\"for [Caragiale] is likely to drink it\\". The character's lines offer glimpses into his financial and social status. Thus, he claims that he does not carry change because the metal might attract lightning, refuses to listen to his friends' confessions because they did not pay the revenue stamp for complaints, and, when told that cabs are available, he sarcastically tells the drivers that they may go home. In one instance, he publicizes his goal to run in elections, but explains that he is going to contest a non-existing seat—at a time when the Romanian Kingdom made use of the census suffrage and had established electoral colleges to stand for the three wealth-based categories, he claims his intention to enlist in the fourth college, for the sparsely- populated area of Bucureştii-Noi. The sketch shows him to be married and to resent his mother-in-law, but to be courting a young female telegraph- operator. 1 Romanian leu banknote of 1915, featuring the portraits of Trajan (left-hand corner) and Decebalus (right-hand corner) In this context, Mitică is shown to have developed a series of jargon-like expressions. When recounting this to his friends that a clerk has been fired from office, refers to this \\"a promotion\\", elaborating that the new office involves \\"chasing flies out of [the park in] Cişmigiu\\". Caragiale provides some of his character's one-liner jokes, which include references to garlic as \\"Serbian vanilla\\", and to Romanian leu banknotes as \\"Trajan's pictures\\" (alluding to their design, which, at the time, featured a portrait of the Roman Emperor). His absurd requests include asking a shopkeeper to sell him \\"a few centimeters\\" of yogurt, and telling friends to drink their beer \\"before it cools itself\\" or to \\"climb on top of a sheet of paper\\" in order to reach for clothes placed higher on a stand. Several of his puns refer to the switch from horse-drawn trams to trolley poles, for instance showing him blaming unexpected stops on horses not having been properly fed. Other texts Mitică was again present in Caragiale's Tot Mitică (\\"Mitică Still\\"), a sketch which only comprises sections of dialog. It begins with an exchange of lines between an unnamed character and Mitică, which was to become one of the best known puns in this sequence. When asked the general interest question De ce trage clopotele, Mitică? (\\"What are they sounding the [church] bells for, Mitică?\\", which, in the Romanian original, may be interpreted as \\"What are they pulling the bells by?\\"), the protagonist answers De frânghie, monşer (\\"By the string, my dear\\"). Ion Luca Caragiale, Tot Mitică (wikisource) Tot Mitică offers other glimpses into the character's financial problems, showing him complaining that he has been \\"pulling the devil's tail\\"—using a traditional proverb to indicate that he has had a hard time getting by. To this, he adds that the devil would be suing him for injuries. He claims that he is going to spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he is talking about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for \\"Mountain of Piety\\"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free (\\"a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper\\"). In other such sequences of events, he is shown eating in a pub as a means to \\"defend himself from death\\", and borrowing money which he promises not to return. When, in order to converse with a friend in a different compartment, he is traveling second class on a first class train ticket, Mitică asks the conductor to pay him the difference. He is shown anxiously walking about in the Bucharest Tribunal hall, and asking to see a lawyer for his defense, jokingly claims that he wants to be defended \\"from flies\\". When invited for a walk in the Herăstrău Park, which was heavily forested at the time, he pretends to have understood this as an invitation to chop trees, and stresses that he buys his firewood. Mitică still frequents the beer garden, and one of the dialogs mentions that he spends entire nights there. He is shown to be flirting with women, including the telephone operator, and boasts that several ladies visit him in his home. The sketch includes several references to well-known characters of the day, including the Conservative Party leader Petre P. Carp, the archaeologist Grigore Tocilescu, the Royal administrator Ioan Kalinderu, the actor Ion Niculescu (as Iancu Niculescu), as well as the dentist Kibrik. The character reveals his tendencies toward political satire, with a one-liner introduced by Caragiale's definition of \\"Mitică as a chauvinist\\"—Mitică is shown announcing that the only song he wants to have played at his funeral is the nationalist tune Deşteaptă-te, române! (which translates as \\"Awaken Thee, Romanian!\\"). Târgul Moşilor, the fair in Obor (late 19th-century painting by Sava Henția) In addition to the main sketch and Tot Mitică, Caragiale introduced a character of this name in a longer piece, titled 1 Aprilie (\\"The 1st of April\\"), which centers on an April Fool gone wrong. Late in the evening, this Mitică decides to hide in Cişmigiu while his lover Cleopatra pretends to court their common friend Mişu Poltronul—with simulated indignation, he takes Mişu by surprise as Cleopatra embraces him. Mitică dies hours after Mişu, who reacts out of instinct to his threatening voice, hits him over the forehead with a cane. Ion Luca Caragiale, 1 Aprilie (wikisource) Another Mitică—\\"Mr. Mitică the haberdasher\\", whose family name is probably Georgescu—is present in the 1900 sketch La Moşi (\\"At the Fair in Obor\\"), where he is shown accompanied by his family and ridiculing his mother-in-law in public. Ion Luca Caragiale, La Moşi (wikisource) In another such piece, titled Iniţiativa... (\\"The Initiative...\\"), Caragiale recounts another dialog with \\"my buddy Mitică\\", who is shown to be unnerved that the Romanian state \\"is indifferent\\" to the fact that infants, his daughter included, do not have wet nurses assigned to them, and that breastfeeding has to rely on the private sector. Ion Luca Caragiale, Iniţiativa... (wikisource) Another or the same Mitică makes a brief appearance in Inspecţiune (\\"An Inspection\\"), where he is one of the clerks investigating the bizarre suicide of the civil servant Anghelache. Garabet Ibrăileanu, Spiritul critic în cultura românească: Spiritul critic în Muntenia - Critica socială extremă: Caragiale (wikisource) A Mitică is present in the piece called Ţal!...—the title comes from a face ţal (\\"to make ţal\\"), an antiquated expression which, as Caragiale explains in the beginning of his story, means \\"to make a payment\\" (from the German zahlen). Ion Luca Caragiale, Ţal!... (wikisource) The writer illustrates this concept by invoking a meeting between him, Mitică, and Mitică's wife Graziella. Caragiale recounts how his friend served him and others a copious dinner in his house, and then made them sit through Graziella's reading of her own lengthy essay on women as portrayed in Romanian folklore. To this goal, Caragiale explains, Mitică discreetly claimed that it was ţal and added, using a quasi-official parlance, that \\"all bills are to be paid\\". The piece ends with Caragiale exiting Mitică's house in haste and: as the latter shouts \\"to be seeing each other\\", he exclaims \\"to be left alone, Mitică\\". Background themes and sources of inspiration Despite Mitică's association with Bucharest and his usual most common career as a state employee, several commentators have recounted that he may have been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia).Şerban Cioculescu, Caragialiana, Editura Eminescu, Bucharest, 1974, p.115-117. Marius Chivu, \\"Lumea înainte şi după Caragiale: Ioana Pârvulescu, În Ţara Miticilor. De şapte ori Caragiale\\" , in Dilema Veche, 176/IV, June 2007 Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store. Mitică and Lache and Mache have often been seen as three manifestations of a main type in Caragiale's work—the petty clerk who spends his time off in lively company. Literary historian Garabet Ibrăileanu, an adherent to the left-wing trend known as Poporanism, was among the first to stress that Mitică's name, like those of Lache and Mache, was actually supposed to enhance his everyday nature, while arguing that the character stood for the first generation of commoners with access to education.Garabet Ibrăileanu, Scriitori români şi străini: Numele proprii în opera comică a lui Caragiale (wikisource) Ibrăileanu, who criticized Caragiale for his satirical overview of the social process, believed that the clerks in his work are unnecessarily cynical, and stressed that Inspecţiune was the only one of his works were \\"one sees at least one glitter of kindness in the souls of the mitici\\". Literary historian George Călinescu saw Mitică as a main representative of Balkan subjects in Ion Luca Caragiale's prose, and listed among the character's other traits his pessimism in respect to historical developments, as well as his interest in rallying people off the street and imposing his ideas on them.George Călinescu, Istoria literaturii române. Compendiu, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1983, p.181 He defined the latter aspect as \\"southern\\", and noted that, like other heroes of Caragiale's sketches, Mitică is \\"at the antipode of Romanticism\\", and inhabits a place where \\"Gothic meditation does not flourish\\". In his history of the Junimea literary society, Z. Ornea argued that there was a link between Mitică's personality and Caragiale's strong rejection of nationalism: > \\"Caragiale's mitici are jovial, good-natured characters, easy-going in their > thought and behavior. Solemnity does not suit them and fanatical monomanias > are unimaginable in this context. An ecstatically nationalist Mitică is a > contradiction in terms, since his formula in life is accommodation, adaption > to the situations.\\"Z. Ornea, Junimea şi junimismul, Vol. II, Editura > Minerva, Bucharest, 1998, p.225. The character and his counterparts have been understood as purveyors and exponents of moft, a concept treasured by Caragiale. The word, meaning \\"trifle\\" or \\"nonsense\\", refers to pretentious and often ridiculous expectations of people caricatured in his work, but is uttered by such characters in reference to each other (as their tendency to dismiss events they are confronted with, no matter how important they may be). Moft was notably present in Caragiale's own satirical magazine, Moftul Român (which he issued at intervals in the 1890s and after 1900). Two mentions of, respectively, moft and the magazine itself are made in Tot Mitică (in reference to Petre P. Carp and to a woman courted by Mitică's friend Costică). Mitică's voluble nature has itself been considered to have negative implications. An assessment of this was offered by Călinescu, who rejected the popular take on the character as boorish: > \\"Mitică is a gossiper, a scoundrel, an intriguer, in general on account of > his garrulous nature, and a generous and confusing mystifier, agreeing to > render services without having the strength to complete them, which in turn > permits him to ask services from anyone else [...]. He is easy-going, with a > horror for suffering and is most of all a well-mannered man. The impression > that Caragiale's heroes are vulgar is false and mostly arises from the fact > that, wishing to seem distinguished, they have not yet cultivated their > speech and gestures.\\" Caragiale created Mitică at a time when the Romanian culture as developed in the Old Kingdom was the recipient of French influence, and the Romanian language was open to Francization. The character himself partakes in the process, and is shown to have adopted several of the manners and pastimes associated with the French Third Republic. Florian Bichir, \\"Noii 'Mitici' şi provincia\\" , in Evenimentul Zilei, January 23, 2007 Modern uses and influence =Cultural and political symbol= The Romanian Old Kingdom (in purple), Transylvania and southern Bukovina in pink, other regions of Greater Romania in orange The literary critic Paul Zarifopol, who was Ion Luca Caragiale's good friend, made several references to Mitică as a prototype of ignorance. He thus used the character to define the most ignorant of journalists and newspaper readers, Paul Zarifopol, Încercări de precizie literară: Mahalagism şi critică de artă, Pentru arta literară: Despre stilul perfect (wikisource) and, in his lengthy essay titled Din registrul ideilor gingaşe (\\"From the Register of Gentle Ideas\\"), argued that Mitică's traits survived in the manners and morals of state employees and journalists after Caragiale's death, throughout World War I and after the creation of Greater Romania. Paul Zarifopol, Din registrul ideilor gingaşe: Lucruri sfinte, Sat şi mahala, Conspiraţia esenţială (wikisource) Political interpretations of Mitică's status were present at an earlier stage: in his influential essay Neoiobăgia (\\"Neo-Serfdom\\"), the Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, himself a friend of Caragiale, used Iniţiativa...'s protagonist to illustrate the interventionist policies of the National Liberal cabinets. Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Neoiobăgia: Cât ne costă neoiobăgia şi legiuirea cvasisocialistă de la 1907 (wikisource) He contended that the two terms of his comparison shared \\"a mania for [state] intervention\\", and argued that the National Liberals had a tendency to overregulate the economy. Commentators such as Constantin Amăriuţei have proposed that there is an intrinsic connection between Mitică and Gore Pirgu, one of the protagonists in the novel Craii de Curtea-Veche, authored by Ion Luca Caragiale's son and rival, the Symbolist Mateiu Caragiale. Dan C. Mihăilescu, \\"Mitică prin Heidegger\\", in Ziarul Financiar, March 4, 2003 Pirgu, who enjoys a successful career during the interwar despite having a shady past and coarse manners, has been defined by Amăriuţei as \\"the eternal and real Mitică of the Romanian world\\". Constantin Amăriuţei was noted for defining Mitică's character (Miticism) through onthologic terms borrowed from the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. He thus argued that, for all their mundane motivations, the character and his peers illustrated a search present with all individuals, identifiable with Heidegger's concepts of Being-in-the-World and Being-toward- death (see Heideggerian terminology). In 2000, several essays by literary historian Laurenţiu Ulici were published posthumously, under the title Mitică şi Hyperion (\\"Mitică and Hyperion\\"). This name drew a direct comparison between the voluble Mitică and an equally famous character in Romanian literature, the aloof, rational, and god-like protagonist of Mihai Eminescu's poem Luceafărul (\\"The Morning Star\\"). Paul Cernat, \\"Bridge peste ape tulburi: Laurenţiu Ulici, Mitică şi Hyperion\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 74, July 2002 Ulici attempted to synthesize the two conflicting natures in the Romanian identity, and viewed the two as terms in \\"an oxymoron\\" standing at the center of Romanian culture. In his essay on the history of drunkenness in Romanian culture, Mircea Bălan defined Mitică as: > \\"The Bucharest wise guy, a haughty rascal, a swindler doubled by a thief and > a boor giving himself airs, deplorable, awkward and discredited from the > get-go, in reality an aborted «dastard», an aborted «wanton».\\" Literary critic Ioana Pârvulescu agreed that there was a link between Mitică and other characters in Caragiale's sketches; she subsequently argued that formed an integral part of the writer's caricature of Romania in its entirety, and that the measure to which they reflected reality is impossible to detect. In her 2007 volume of essays, titled În Ţara Miticilor. De şapte ori Caragiale (\\"In the Land of the Mitici. Seven Times Caragiale\\"), she stressed that the character was both more human and more artificial than his usual interpretations in 20th century commentary. A particular definition of Mitică and mitici was adopted by many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as sciolist, arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici may be seen as not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe). Antoanella Capelle-Pogăcean, \\"Observaţii pe tema creării unui partid regional\\", in Provincia, December 2000, p.8 In September 1998, the Transylvanian journalist and essayist Sabin Gherman issued a pamphlet titled M-am săturat de România (\\"I've Grown Tired of Romania\\"), which was at the center of a scandal over its radical tone and demands for regional autonomy in Transylvania. In its first lines, the message drew a parallel between Mitică and \\"politicians in power\\", identifying centralism and the politics of Romania with, among other things, disorganization and statism. Sabin Gherman, \\"M-am săturat de România\\", at Fundaţia Civică proTransilvania; retrieved September 10, 2007 Gherman went on to contrast \\"the seriousness, the elegance, the discipline\\" which he attributed to Transylvania with the invasion of \\"miticisms, ordinary Balkanisms, the civilization of pumpkin seeds\\". The latter sentence comprised a reference to the habit of consuming seeds as snacks, in which he saw evidence of rudimentary behavior: > \\"Here [that is, outside Transylvania], one doesn't have rights, but > complaisances. Here they eat pumpkin seeds, they use «there is many» in > their speech, and, in general, people get born, multiply themselves and > die.\\" =Portrayals and tributes= One of the best-known references to the character is the 1981 film De ce trag clopotele, Mitică? (translated as \\"Why Are the Bells Ringing, Mitică?\\"), directed by Lucian Pintilie. Titled after the opening dialog in Tot Mitică, the film was actually structured around Caragiale's play D-ale carnavalului, and included portions from several other writings—including 1 Aprilie. Mitică, who makes a brief appearance before dying at the hands of Mişu Poltronul, is portrayed by Ştefan Iordache. De ce trag clopotele, Mitică? was noted for its subtle undertones, through which it expressed criticism of the Romanian communist regime (at a time when the country was led by Nicolae Ceauşescu). Doinel Tronaru, \\" 'De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?' \\" - De frînghie, monşer! , at LiterNet (originally published in România Liberă, March 2, 2002) In 2003, the Luceafărul Theater in Iaşi hosted a dramatized version of Momente şi schiţe. Titled În lumea lui Mitică (\\"In Mitică's World\\"), it was directed by Constantin Brehnescu and starred Dionisie Vitcu. Ileana Tîrnăveanu, \\"Iaşi. În lumea lui Mitică\\", in Evenimentul, September 22, 2003 The national television channel TVR 2 produces a weekly show titled D'ale lu' Mitică (roughly: \\"Mitică's Stuff\\"), whose title is inspired by Caragiale's hero. Hosted by the actor Mitică Popescu, the show groups reportage pieces from the Romanian countryside, recording unusual events which, the editors believe, serve to illustrate the problems faced by small communities in the post-1989 transition period.

No VISE-themed proposals reached the finalist stage. VISE was again an eligible theme, this time one of eight, in the 2009 competition to select New Frontiers Mission 3. One VISE-themed proposal, Surface and Atmosphere Geochemical Explorer or SAGE, was an unsuccessful finalist. VISE was one of six eligible themes for candidate missions for New Frontiers Mission 4 to be launched in 2024. Of the 12 proposals submitted and reviewed by NASA, three were associated with this theme: two lander proposals, Venus In situ Composition Investigations (VICI) and Venus In Situ Atmospheric and Geochemical Explorer (VISAGE); and the Venus Origins Explorer (VOX), an orbiter whose proponents claimed would achieve similar scientific outcomes.

It was a major restructuring of the previous land taxation system, and established the right of private land ownership in Japan for the first time. Previous land taxation system The land taxation system was first established during the Taika Reform in 645 along with the adoption of the Chinese judicial system known as the . The previous system was an imitation of the Tang dynasty's corvée taxation system, known as the . Taxes were paid in the form of rice and other crops under this system, and the tax rates were determined through the land survey created by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. A proportionate annual tax was assessed according to the yield of a given plot of land. The principal farmer's name was registered in the land survey, and that farmer would be held accountable for the land tax. The payment could also be held as part of the village's collective responsibility under the . Announcement of the reform The Meiji Government announced the reformation of the land taxation system in 1873 as part of the Meiji . Efforts at instating the system began the following year. The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system when the 1874 budget showed that collected taxes fell far below projected values. The government responded by establishing a land tax reform department in 1875, and began aggressive efforts to install the system. Under the direction of the new department, each prefecture was assigned a set amount of taxes it was required to collect. The department forcefully changed land values to meet the set amount if values reported by farmers did not meet projected values. This caused widespread resentment among farmers, and several large-scale riots erupted around the country. In January 1877, the government lowered the tax rate from 3% to 2.5% in an effort to regain support for the land tax. The department's aggressive system continued through 1878, but the strictness of rules gradually decreased as it became clear that required amounts would be met. The reforms had taken complete effect by 1880, seven years after the start of the reforms. Changes from previous taxation As mentioned earlier, taxes were paid in rice and crops until the end of the Edo period, and the cultivator was held as the taxpayer under the previous system. Taxation was also inconsistent, as values differed in certain regions of the country. The new land tax created a uniform system which taxed landowners based on the worth of their land, and were paid in cash instead of crops. The main changes between the two systems are as follows: *Taxes were calculated as a proportion of the cash value of the land based on harvest potential, rather than the actual crop yield. *A cash-based system over payment with crops. *A uniformly set tax rate at 3%; a reduction from the previous system. *The landowner, confirmed by the issuance of land bonds, was liable for the taxes instead of the farmer. *The system was standardized across Japan. Reform effects =Stabilization of tax revenue= The government could be assured of a steady income because the tax was set at a constant rate against the value of the land, and revenue did not fluctuate with crop yields since tax income became independent of crop fluctuation. Essentially, the risks of crop fluctuation were pushed from the government to the farmer. The land tax reform ended up increasing the burden on villages with hunter-gatherer lifestyles in uncultivated lands, and resulted in several farmer insurrections against the Meiji government, including the and the . The discontent also helped fuel the . The Meiji government lowered the tax rate to 2.5% in 1877 in fear of further revolts. =Private ownership of land= Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. The previous practice of land ownership was the , which stated that all land was under the sole ownership of the emperor, such that individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English (and later United Kingdom) statute Quia Emptores enacted several centuries earlier. Prior to the enactment of the land tax reform, the unilateral ban on trading and selling farmland was rescinded in 1872, and the use of real estate as collateral for agricultural loans was legalized in 1873. =Suffrage rights= The previous feudal contract system became obsolete because the landowner was the one held responsible for taxes, and gave landowners the right to participate in politics. Later when the Imperial Diet was established, many of those given the right to vote in the lower house belonged to this landowning class. =Commerce and circulation of currency= In the previous system, rice and crops collected from each fiefdom were sold and distributed by wholesale dealers via daimyō storehouses in Edo or Osaka. The reform allowed farmers to sell their crops for cash directly to local merchants, and had a large effect on Japanese commerce. Establishment of land bonds Face of a land bond issued in 1879. back began to be recorded in a registry as a result of the land surveys implemented by the land tax reform. These land bonds created a system of verifiable land ownership, indicated the person responsible for taxes, and established buying and selling rights, allowing real estate commerce and credit to become dependent on these bonds. The land bond registry was dissolved in 1889 after its duties were handed over to the land register department in 1884. Payment of taxes was managed solely by this new department until 1961. All addresses, zoning classifications, and acreage information were transferred to the land register department, so it can be said that current Japanese land ownership records are directly traceable to the land tax reform. However, details in the registry were not always accurate because of the primitive surveying techniques used by farmers at the start of the reform. This was both due to time and personnel limitation, and deliberate tax evasion attempts, ( and ) resulting in inaccuracies in the modern registry. The is currently underway to create an accurate registry for all of Japan.

He was a frontier doctor in what would become the U.S. state of Oregon. A native of Ohio, he served in the Provisional Government of Oregon and later was a member of the Oregon State Legislature. The Newell House Museum, his reconstructed former home on the French Prairie in Champoeg, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early life Newell was born on March 30, 1807, in Zanesville, Ohio.Corning, Howard M. (1956) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. In 1829, Newell joined William Sublette and his group on a party to trap beaver. Others in the group included Joseph L. Meek and Jedediah Smith. He trapped fur in the region west of the Rockies in the 1830s, and married Kitty, a Nez Perce woman in 1833. During his time as a mountain man, he became so skilled at basic surgery and healing, despite not having professional medical training, that he earned the nickname \\"Doctor\\" or \\"Doc\\" Newell that stayed with him the rest of his life. In 1840, he moved permanently to Oregon Country with his brother-in-law Joseph Meek. They settled on the Tualatin Plains, arriving on December 25 on the plains with two head of cattle. This was the first time that a wagon completed the journey from Fort Hall to the Columbia River along the Oregon Trail. The following year, they brought the first wagon into the Willamette Valley. Oregon In 1842, Newell helped to establish the Oregon Lyceum at Oregon City, Oregon. He would later become the director of the Oregon Printing Association that grew out of the Lyceum and started the first newspaper west of the Rocky Mountains, the Oregon Spectator. At the May 2, 1843, settler meeting Newell voted in favor of creating a provisional government in the region. The vote passed 52 to 50 and a Provisional Legislature was created. Newell served in that body from 1843 until it was replaced with the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1849, although he resigned during the final session.Oregon Legislative Assembly (4th Provisional) 1848-1849 Regular Session.

He remarried in 1846 to Rebecca Newman. After the Whitman Massacre and during the ensuing Cayuse War, he was appointed as a peace commissioner. In that role, on March 7, 1848, he negotiated to keep the Nez Perce tribe out of the war. Newell was then appointed as Indian agent for the tribes located south of the Columbia River in the Oregon Territory before moving to California to mine during the California Gold Rush in 1849. In 1850, he returned to Oregon where he platted the Champoeg townsite with Andre Longtain. From 1855 to 1856 he was the commander of a company of army scouts during the Rogue River Wars. In 1860, Newell was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives after Oregon achieved statehood in 1859. He served as a Democrat representing Marion County.Oregon Legislative Assembly (1st) 1860 Regular Session. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on January 30, 2008.

Later years After the 1861 Willamette River flood, Newell moved to Lapwai, Idaho where he worked as an interpreter and commissioner for the army outpost at that location from 1862 to 1868. His second wife died in May 1867, and he married a third and final time in 1869 to Mrs. Ward. In 1868, he went to Washington, D.C., along with several Indian chiefs, to attempt to amend some treaties between the United States and the Native American tribes. United States President Andrew Johnson then appointed him as an Indian agent that year. Robert Newell died on November 24, 1869 in Lapwai, Idaho, from a heart attack. He fathered five children by his first wife, and eleven by his second wife. After his death, several Native American tribes granted him of land in what is now Lewiston, with the deed dated June 9, 1871.

Users were able to register with the service to obtain a phone number chosen from several Washington State area codes and have all calls to that number forwarded to their Session Initiation Protocol or Inter- Asterisk eXchange uniform resource identifier, including an Asterisk server. The telephone company that provided IPKall numbers is International Telcom; they also provide a flat-rate $1/month area code 206 inbound fax service as Faxaway, a non-free voice and fax service as Kall8 (with toll-free or US local numbers) and the Kallback and KallCents discount outbound long-distance services. IPKall's popularity stemmed from the fact that it was probably the last remaining, widely accessible US-based VoIP service offering free-of- charge PSTN numbers. Business model The IPKall business model appears to be based on its ability to charge termination rates for calls reaching its subscribers, estimated at about $.01/min, as the service is free for end users. The wholesale price for major interexchange carriers to terminate calls to independent telcos in rural Washington (state) and similar locations (such as northern Minnesota and Iowa) is often several cents a minute higher than typical US48 rates; this money is effectively a subsidy to the destination local rural exchange. New registered numbers should receive a call within 72 hours of creation. And also, numbers which don't receive calls within 30 days are taken to be inactive and removed from the service. Direct customer support is not provided. The free plan does not support outgoing calls, except to toll-free telephone numbers.

The colour red and the star are symbols of communism; grains are often used to represent agriculture, farmers, or the common people, the cogwheel or other industrial tools represent the industrial proletariat. Socialist heraldry, also called communist heraldry, consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by socialist states and filled with communist symbolism. Although commonly called coats of arms, most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the heraldic sense and should therefore not be called arms at all. Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of European heraldry in order to distance themselves from the monarchies that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs. The Soviet Union was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after World War II, when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist (or communist) states have adopted the style, for various reasons —usually because communists had helped them to gain independence or establish their republican governments. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989–1991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside. Origin and history Soviet leaders sought to distinguish their insignia from the emblems used by the Russian Emperor and aristocracy. They replaced and omitted the traditional heraldic devices, substituting an emblem that did not conform to traditional European practices. The Soviet Union, created after the 1917 revolution, required insignia to represent itself in line with other sovereign states, such as emblems, flags and seals, but the Soviet leaders did not wish to continue the old heraldic practices which they saw as associated with the societal system the revolution sought to replace. In response to the needs and wishes, the national emblem adopted would lack the traditional heraldic elements of a shield, helm, crest and mantling, and instead be presented more plainly. This style was followed then by other socialist and communist states, which wished to also focus attention on the nation's workers and diverge from feudalism and all of its associations. In some communist countries, the socialist heraldry was never adopted fully. The coat of arms of Poland was only changed slightly under the communist era, retaining the traditional heraldic form. In Hungary, the \\"Rákosi badge\\", an emblem in the form of socialist heraldry, was adopted following the Second World War, but after the 1956 uprising, a new emblem was created combining communist symbolism with a heraldic shield in the colours of the Hungarian flag. Czechoslovakia became a Communist country in 1948 but retained its original coat of arms until 1961, when they were replaced with a non-traditional shield depicting the heraldic Bohemian lion without a crown and with a red star above head. Some of the states of Yugoslavia also used heraldic shields coupled with socialist imagery in their emblems, as did two republics within the USSR: the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Characteristics Socialist heraldry typically makes use of the following symbols: * Hammer and sickle, representing respectively the workers and peasantry. More rarely, a hammer may be used on its own, to represent the working class(es) as a whole. * The five- pointed Red star, representing the five fingers of the worker's hand and the five continents on the earth. Often displayed with a yellow border, or a yellow five-pointed star, often on a red background * Wreaths of grain or other domesticated plants encircling the emblem, representing agriculture and plenty * Interwoven ribbons in national and/or red colors, sometimes used for a motto * Single or multiple gears, often crossed, representing industry * The rising sun, representing revolution * Earth * Landscapes * Books, representing the intelligentsia. * Modern industrial accessories such as cogwheels and electricity pylons Present With the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc in Europe, most of these countries' socialist heraldry has been replaced with old pre-communist symbols or by wholly new coats of arms. Socialist heraldry is still seen in the emblems of several countries, such as the People's Republic of China. North Korea has a national emblem in pure socialist style, as does Vietnam. During the infancy years of the Russian Federation (the successor to the Soviet Union), the country used the modified version of the emblem of the RSFSR with the inscription was changed from RSFSR (РСФСР) to the Russian Federation (Российская Федерация/Rossiyskaya Federaciya) until the new coat of arms was adopted in 1993. The national emblem of Belarus was adopted in 1995 following a controversial referendum. It is reminiscent of that of the Byelorussian SSR and replaced the coat of arms of 1991-1995 which followed the traditional heraldic style. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan retained components of their respective republics for similar reasons. The national emblem of North Macedonia is reminiscent of that of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (once a constituent socialist republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). In Africa, the emblems of Angola and Mozambique, as well as Guinea-Bissau, use socialist heraldry. The Republic of Serbia used the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of SerbiaLaw on the use of the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia ( (\\"SG SRS\\", br. 6/1985.) until the recommended symbols by the National Assembly on August 17, 2004. The recommended usage was made Law on May 11, 2009 thus officially replacing the socialist heraldic Coat of arms. The unrecognised state of Transnistria has a state emblem based on a Soviet-era design, despite not being a socialist state. Galleries Below are galleries of historical and current national emblems. The years given are for the emblems, not for the countries. This is not an exhaustive gallery, since they are here to illustrate the article, not to show every example. Only long-lasting emblems of independent countries are shown. They also exclude emblems which were a mix of traditional heraldry and socialist symbolism, like the present arms of São Tomé e Príncipe and of East Timor, the 1960-1990 Emblem of Czechoslovakia, or the 1974-2008 state seal of Burma, or traditional heraldic coats of arms of socialist countries, like those of Guyana and Cuba. =Current emblems= Marxist-Leninist states File:National Emblem of the People's Republic of China (2).svgNational Emblem of the People's Republic of China (1950–present) File:Emblem of Laos.svgEmblem of Laos (1992–present) File:Emblem of Vietnam.svgEmblem of Vietnam (1976–present), previously of North Vietnam (1955–1976) Non-Marxist-Leninist states File:Emblem of Angola.svgEmblem of Angola (1990–present) File:Coat_of_arms_of_Belarus_(2020).svgNational emblem of Belarus (1995–present) File:Emblem of Guinea-Bissau.svgEmblem of Guinea-Bissau (1973–present) File:Emblem of North Korea.svgEmblem of North Korea (1993–present) File:Coat of arms of the Republic of Macedonia.svgNational emblem of North Macedonia (2009–present) File:Emblem of Mozambique.svgEmblem of Mozambique (1990–present) File:Emblem of Nepal.svgEmblem of Nepal (2008–present) File:Emblem of Tajikistan.svgEmblem of Tajikistan (1993–present) File:Emblem of Uzbekistan.svgEmblem of Uzbekistan (1992–present) ; Unrecognized states File:Coat of arms of Transnistria.svgCoat of arms of Transnistria (1991–present) =Historical emblems= File:Emblem of Afghanistan (1978-1980).svgEmblem of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1978–1980) File:Emblem of Afghanistan (1980-1987).svgEmblem of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1980–1987) File:Coat of arms of the People's Republic of Albania.svgEmblem of the Socialist People's Republic of Albania (1946–1991) File:Emblem of the People's Republic of Benin.svgEmblem of the People's Republic of Benin (1975–1990) File:Coat of arms of Burkina Faso 1984-1991.svgEmblem of Burkina Faso (1984–1987) File:Coat of arms of Bulgaria (1971-1990).svgEmblem of the People's Republic of Bulgaria (1971–1990) File:Coat of Arms of Cape Verde (1975).svgEmblem of the Republic of Cape Verde (1975–1992) File:Coat of Arms of the People's Republic of Congo.svgEmblem of the People's Republic of the Congo (1970–1992) File:Emblem of the Derg.svgEmblem of the Ethiopian Derg (1975–1987) File:PDR Ethiopia emblem.svgEmblem of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (1987–1991) File:Coat of Arms of East Germany (1950–1953).svgEmblem of the German Democratic Republic (1950–1953) File:State arms of German Democratic Republic.svgEmblem of the German Democratic Republic (1955–1990) File:Iraq state emblem CoA 1959-1965 Qassem.svgEmblem of the Iraqi Republic (1959–1965)P.J.

He was the senior priest and founder who envisaged the formation of the first native religious institution in India Carmelites of Mary Immaculate also known as C.M.I. (the first native religious institute of the Eastern Catholic Church), and the founder of the first seminary for Syro-Malabar Catholics. Life =Palackal Family= Palackal Thoma Malpan was born in Palackal family, about 1780 in the village of Pallippuram, an ancient Christian priestly family in Kerala that trace their origin as Jewish lineage who baptized by Thomas the Apostle a disciple of Jesus Christ at Kottakkavu, North Paravoor. Most Christians in Kerala are known as Syrian Christians in view of the Syriac (classical form of Aramaic) liturgy used in church services since the early days of Christianity in India. They are also known as \\"Nasrani\\" (followers of Jesus the Nazarene). Pallippuram, is now part of the state of Kerala, then in the Kingdom of Travancore. Thoma Palackal felt a call to the Christian ministry, for which he pursued theological studies under a noted priest of the Syrian Church, Abraham Thachil. He received Holy Orders in 1807. After Thoma's ordination he was named as Secretary for the Saint Thomas Christians and a councilor to the Vicariate Apostolic of Malabar (now the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly), who led them in the name of the Holy See in Rome, Bishop Raimundo di San Giuseppe Roviglia, O.C.D. (1803–1815).Catholic Hierarchy He would serve as a councilor to the Apostolic Vicariate for the rest of his life. As a major leader of Syrian Catholic Church in India, Palackal Thoma Malpan (Fr.Thomas Palackal) introduced many Western practices among his people. These included the use of a Roman style white cassock by the clergy, in order to distinguish them from the clergy of the Jacobite Christians. Additionally, the use of a confessional and cemetery with boundary wall were mandated for all churches and confraternities were established for the greater participation of the laity in church services. Founder of C.M.I =Educator and founder= Fr.Thomas Palackal returned to his hometown in 1818. After settling there, he found several young men who asked him to train them for the priesthood. He then opened a small seminary for this purpose. Among his first students was Kuriakose Chavara, who would later join him in forming the first religious congregation in the Syro-Malabar Church. They developed a paternal bond which lasted his whole life. Fr.Thomas Palackal insisted on the rigorous development of both soul and mind in his seminary. For the first, he wrote a Rule of life for the seminarians which was a strict routine of prayer and fasting. For the latter, he taught himself Tamil so that he could translate the best spiritual resources printed in that language by the Jesuits into their native Malayalam language for the benefit of his students. Fr.Palackal seems to have long held a desire for life in a religious community similar to that of the Discalced Carmelites who led the Catholic faith in that region. He was joined in this by his student, Chavara. They found another like-minded priest of the Vicariate, Thomas Porukkara. In 1831 they were given the permission of the Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic, Bishop Maurelio Stabellini, O.C.D., to establish a religious community. The Monastery of St. Joseph was then founded in Mannanam on 11 May of that year. The small community called themselves the \\"Servants of Mary Immaculate\\" and lived under the Rule of the Discalced Third Order.Carmelites of Mary Immaculate \\"A Short (History) of CMI\\" In 1833 Palackal moved his seminary there to train the clergy of both the Vicariate and his new community. =Death= Fr.Thomas Palackal died in his native city on 16 January 1841. He was buried in the main altar of Pallippuram St. Mary's Church.St. Mary's Forane Church, Pallippuram \\"History\\" Legacy Chavara went on to found the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate in 1855, after the death of his mentor.

The 70 Reggiane Re2000s delivered from Italy were modified with Hungarian equipment and fitted with Hungarian-built Manfred Weiss WM K-14 engines. The Héja was re-designed for Hungarian manufacture as the Héja II and a further 203 were built by MÁVAG for the Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő (Royal Hungarian Air Force), which used them in operations against the Soviet Union alongside German units. Design and development In December 1939 seventy Reggiane Re.2000 fighters, purchased from Italy, were delivered to the Magyar Királyi Állami Vas-, Acél- és Gépgyárak, (\\"Royal Hungarian State Iron, Steel and Machine Works\\"), where they were modified into MÁVAG Héja I (\\"Goshawk I\\") fighters. The original Piaggio P.XI engines were replaced by the Hungarian-built Manfred Weiss WM K-14 driving Hamilton Standard three-bladed, constant-speed propellers. The WM K-14 was a licensed copy of the French Gnome-Rhône 14K engine that necessitated a 1-foot 3-inch lengthening of the fighters' forward fuselage, to restore the center of gravity to a safe position. The Piaggio engine was itself also a copy of the Gnome-Rhône 14K, it was more reliable than the Italian engines. However, the aircraft also suffered from a number of drawbacks. The Hungarian and Italian chemical industries were not able to produce enough good insulation material for wing tanks, thus early planes (Héja I. and all of Italian Re.2000) flown with continuously leaking fuel tanks and late models (Héja II.) had rows of small tanks in the wing, therefore manufacturing complexity and weight of the plane has been increased. Yaw stability was poor and the Héja's predisposition to sideslip was very dangerous at low altitude (it killed István Horthy), moreover the subsequent mass increase of Héja II. has worsened this issue. A decision was soon made to produce more Héja fighters under license in Hungary as the MÁVAG Héja II (Goshawk II). The new Héja II was entirely Hungarian with locally produced airframes, engines and armament, which was changed to twin Gebauer Motorgeppuska 1940.Minta GKM motor-driven machine guns in the fuselage nose with 300 rpg. The first MÁVAG Héja II took to the air on 30 October 1942 and MÁVAG built a further 203 Héja IIs for the Royal Hungarian Air Force, with the last aircraft completed on 1 August 1944. Operational history István Horthy with his Héja, 1942 The Kingdom of Hungary was allied to Nazi Germany during World War II, with at least one Hungarian squadron flying the MÁVAG Héja in combat on the Eastern Front. However, most Héjas operated inside Hungary in an air defense role or as a trainer. On 20 August 1942, personal tragedy struck the Hungarian Regent Miklós Horthy, when 37-year-old István Horthy, Horthy's eldest son, Deputy Regent of Hungary and a Flight Lieutenant in the reserves, was killed while flying Heja V.421 of 1/1 Fighter Squadron Royal Hungarian Air Force near Ilovskoye.Milestones Time In 1943, 98 Héjas were produced and another 72 in 1944. They were regarded as no longer suitable for combat against modern Soviet fighters and should have served as fighter trainer only.Neulen 2000, p. 130. The Luftwaffe was reluctant to re-equip its Hungarian ally: the deliveries of aircraft went primarily to front-line formations and there was still danger of a Hungarian-Romanian conflict. Moreover, Hitler held an extremely bad opinion of the Hungarian aviators.Neulen 2000, pp. 130–131. So, the Hungarian Air Force was forced to use the licence-built Reggiane. The last offensive sortie of the Hejas took place on 2 April 1944, when 180 15th Air Force USAAF bombers, escorted by 170 fighters, bombed the Danube Aircraft Works in Budapest and other targets. The Fighter Control Centre dispatched one wing of Hejas from 1/1 Fighter squadron, along with a couple of Messerschmitt Me 210Cas and 12 Bf 109Gs. The Honvéd pilots claimed 11 American aircraft (six of them confirmed). USAAF pilots reported to have shot down 27 Hungarian aircraft, while only two Hungarians were killed.Neulen 2000, p. 136.

Stimson, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank which aims to enhance international peace and security through a combination of analysis and outreach. The Center's stated approach is pragmatic – seeking to provide policy alternatives, solve problems, and overcome obstacles towards a more peaceful and secure world. Stimson seeks to offer pragmatic solutions and policy-relevant information and analysis on a range of global issues to decision-makers. It focuses on a range of challenges to peace and prosperity such as nuclear proliferation, arms trafficking, water management, wildlife poaching, and responses to humanitarian crises. In 2013, Stimson received the MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions. Stimson was ranked 21st best U.S. think tank in the University of Pennsylvania's 2016 Global Go To Think Tanks Report. Stimson seeks to provide expertise for the policymaking community – the U.S. executive and legislative branches, international institutions and governments, and policy research institutions – as well as the media, academia and general public. History The Stimson Center was founded in 1989 by Barry Blechman and Michael Krepon. Stimson is currently led by Chairman of the Board David J. Lane and President and CEO Brian Finlay. The Stimson Center is funded by research contracts, grants from foundations and other donations. Programs =Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense= Stimson's Budgeting for Foreign Affairs and Defense (BFAD) program seeks to improve American national security at a lower cost to the American people. It also works to strengthen the capacity and capability of the US government to frame, resource, and execute foreign and national security policies and programs. =East Asia= The East Asia program conducts research on vital regional security issues and offers insights and recommendations for policymakers in the U.S. and in the region on a variety of issues. The program analyzes the dynamics of cross-Strait relations, including the exchange of ideas and people between the U.S. and Asia-Pacific region. The program also examines China's foreign relations toward Northeast and Southeast Asia, with a special focus on Myanmar, Iran and Africa, and addresses U.S.–Japan alliance relations and developments on the Korean Peninsula. =Environmental Security= The Environmental Security program explores how increased stress on global ecosystems and shared natural resources may compromise economic development, fuel social conflict, and undermine political stability in key areas throughout the world. Through collaborative stakeholder engagement, Stimson works to provide policy-relevant analysis, promote useful knowledge-sharing, build partnerships, and forge pragmatic policy solutions that ensure the sustainable management of shared natural resources and the mitigation of environmental risks. = Global Political Demography = The focus of the Global Political Demography (GPD) program is to draw upon available demographic projections to produce global statistical forecasts for a set of political, social, and economic transitions. The program also examines sub-national demographic data to forecast trends in ethnoreligious relations within states and to recommend sets of responsive policies. =Managing Across Boundaries= The Managing Across Boundaries (MAB) initiative develops government responses at the national, regional, and international levels, and accelerates public-private partnerships to mitigate these threats. Experts work in multiple arenas – conventional arms, drones, environmental crime, private sector engagement, weapons of mass destruction, illicit trafficking and counterfeiting, and the nexus between security and development. =Middle East= The Middle East program explores issues that affect regional security from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Stimson scholars are working on cross-border dynamics in the region, and are focused on the rising threat from sectarianism and its roots in radical Islamic ideology, looking at key countries and at regional consequences. The program's Gulf Security work analyzes traditional and nontraditional security issues impacting the Gulf States and their neighbors. In 2015, the program is monitoring the regional security repercussions of the Iran nuclear negotiations. =South Asia= The South Asia program seeks to reduce nuclear dangers in South Asia by focusing on risks associated with the accelerating arms competition between India and Pakistan. These risks are amplified by the activities of terrorist groups and political instability in the region. The program has championed confidence-building and nuclear risk-reduction measures in South Asia for over twenty years. The South Asia program analyzes U.S. crisis management on the subcontinent, producing case studies of the “Twin Peaks” and Mumbai crises, and identifying future challenges. The program seeks to empower an emerging generation of strategic analysts in South Asia by means of the South Asian Voices website, conferences, and visiting fellowships. =Southeast Asia= Brian Eyler is the Director of the Stimson Center's Southeast Asia program, and is regarded as an expert on transboundary issues in the Mekong region and China's economic relationship with Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asia program addresses major challenges facing the region today, ranging from the food-water-energy security nexus in the Mekong Basin to political and economic issues of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) integration. The main focus of the program's research is development in the Greater Mekong Subregion, particularly hydroelectric power projects and their impacts on the food-water-security nexus and regional stability. The program also regularly addresses trade, economic, and political issues involving ASEAN member states, U.S.–ASEAN relations and policy issues, and maritime security issues in the South China Sea, particularly territorial disputes and fishery management. =Space Security= Stimson's Space Security program seeks to advance an International Code of Conduct for responsible space-faring nations and to prevent dangerous military activities. It focuses on how to reduce clear and present dangers facing every space-faring nation. The International Code of Conduct strengthens norms for debris mitigation and space traffic management procedures, and against tests of debris-causing anti- satellite weapons and harmful interference of satellite operations. =Transforming Conflict and Governance= The Transforming Conflict and Governance program examines whether and how international conflict management and support to good governance can create sustainable peace in areas plagued by violence. It focuses in particular on violence against civilians and its prevention and the impact of climate change on the livelihoods of vulnerable populations, including those in zones of conflict.

Eastern part of the village lies in the historical region of Těšín Silesia. The village church has a monument on the outside of the cemetery wall commemorating the social poem Maryčka Magdónova, by Petr Bezruč. The rectory of the church was damaged in a fire in early September 2009.  History  In 1636 a steel mill was opened here, locally known as hamry, hence the name of the village (whereas staré means old). Initially the village was located only on the right bank of the Ostravice, within Silesia, politically as a part of the Friedek state country that was split from the Duchy of Teschen in 1573, which was a part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, since 1526 a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I and fall of Austria-Hungary it became a part of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939 it became a part of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. After World War II it was restored to Czechoslovakia. In 1951 the northern part of the village was split from Staré Hamry and joined with Ostravice municipality, whereas southern part of Ostravice was split from it and joined with Staré Hamry, and so both municipalities now lie on both banks of the Ostravice river, as opposed to the previous situation when they were lying concurrently on the opposite banks of the river.

The first Whippoorwill to be so named by the Navy, Minesweeper No. 35 was laid down on 12 December 1917 at Mobile, Alabama, by the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company; launched on 4 July 1918; sponsored by Miss M. I. Evans; and commissioned on 1 April 1919. World War I mine clearance After fitting out, Whippoorwill departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 3 July 1919, bound for Scotland. Operating subsequently from the port of Kirkwall, the minesweeper participated in the clearing of the North Sea Mine Barrage as part of Division 3, Minesweeping Squadron, Atlantic Fleet. This was completed by late autumn of 1919. Post-war transfer to the Pacific Fleet Returning to the United States in November 1919, Whipporwill was later assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Having been classified as AM-35 on 17 July 1920, the minesweeper arrived at Pearl Harbor, her new home port, on 1 March 1921. She would operate out of that base for the next 20 years, with brief periods spent as station ship at Pago Pago, Samoa, between 1931 and 1934. Whippoorwill's prime duty was service to the Fleet. Besides filling the role for which she was designed—sweeping and laying mines—upon occasion she towed targets and plane-guarded. Performing surveys in the Pacific In the early 1920s she participated in surveys of various and sundry Pacific islands. In July 1923,Whippoorwill together with her sister-ship Tanager (AM-5) accomplished the first survey of Johnston Island in modern times. During that cruise, she carried members of the Tanager Expedition, a joint expedition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Bishop Museum of Hawaii. She also carried a Douglas DT-2 floatplane on her fantail, hoisting it into the water so that it could take off for aerial survey and mapping flights over Johnston. Whippoorwill made other cruises, carrying members of ornithological surveys to islands such as Kingman Reef, Palmyra, Christmas Island, Jarvis Island, Howland Island, and Baker Island. Whippoorwill modernized in 1941 The minesweeper departed Pearl Harbor on 5 May 1941, bound for the Asiatic Fleet. En route, the minecraft plane-guarded at prearranged stations, serving as a direction-finding station for patrol planes flying to the Philippines to reinforce the Asiatic Fleet's air wing—Patrol Wing 10. After touching briefly at Guam, in the Marianas, on 23 May, Whippoorwill reached Manila on the 30th. There, she became part of Mine Division 9, Mine Squadron 3, Asiatic Fleet. In the ensuing months, Whippoorwill performed a variety of service tasks. She towed targets for the cruisers and destroyers of the Fleet to fire at during battle practices and gunnery shoots, assisted in unmooring and mooring the Fleet's submarine and destroyer tenders from buoys, and conducted similar activities. Philippine operations That spring, Whippoorwill operated with Canopus (AS-9) during maneuvers in the southern Philippines, touching at Zamboanga and steaming in the Sulu Sea, before returning to Cavite and anchoring in Canacao Bay. Soon thereafter, she commenced operations with the Inshore Patrol. Whippoorwill operated on patrol duties and laid mines—laying the field near Caballo Island, near Corregidor, at the entrance to Manila Bay. She and Tanager also laid the mine field at Subic Bay while operating out of the section base at Olongapo. After an overhaul at Cavite and at the Verdadero Dockyard across Canacao Bay from Cavite, Whippoorwill took up patrol duties in the late autumn, frequently alternating with the gunboats Asheville (PG-21) and Tulsa (PG-22). On 22 November, while on patrol station \\"Cast,\\" she fired four shots across the bow of the sailing vessel Remedio VIII before the vessel hove to. She later prevented the Army tug Harrison from entering the area and warned off other vessels on the 26th and 28th. Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor Relieved by Tulsa on station on 30 November, Whippoorwill returned to Canacao Bay before she got underway on 3 December for sweeping operations out of Cavite. At 0415 on the 8th, Whippoorwill received the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The ship's commanding officer, soon called his crew to quarters and announced the news. Within hours, Whippoorwill was underway, commencing her first wartime sweeping operations in Manila Bay. =Under air attack in the Philippines= At 1230 on 10 December, the air raid alert was broadcast at Cavite. At 1250, Whippoorwill weighed anchor and stood out to maneuver in Manila Bay, away from the confining waters near Cavite itself. Soon the enemy's high-level bombers were droning overhead, above the effective range of the navy yard's 3-inch batteries; every ship in the harbor opened up with their antiaircraft batteries. In the ensuing action, Whippoorwill claimed assists in splashing two bombers and sending another one crashing on shore nearby. =Peary struck by Japanese bombs= Peary (DD-226) alongside Central Wharf for an overhaul was hit by a bomb that struck the foremast, snapping it off above the searchlight platform and sending shards of metal down onto the bridge and fire-control platform, killing or wounding nearly every man there—including the commander and his executive officer. Meanwhile, bombs blasted and set afire the torpedo warehouse across the wharf; warheads exploded and burned. Comdr. Ferriter saw Peary's predicament and moved his ship through the burning navy yard and eased Whippoorwill near the destroyer's stern and passed a towline. Braving the burning firebrands from the blazing warehouse, the destroyermen made fast the line, and the minesweeper commenced backing. The towline stretched taut—only to part! Twice more Ferriter's command closed the immobile destroyer, both ships endangered by warheads detonating nearby. Finally, on the third try, the line held; and, with debris showering upon the minesweeper and her crippled charge, Whippoorwill pulled Peary free. =Whippoorwill pulls Peary out of danger= Soon thereafter, Whippoorwill moored Peary to a buoy in Manila Bay and took the destroyer's wounded to the hospital at Sangley Point in her motor launch. Later that evening, the minesweeper unmoored from the destroyer and stood out, anchoring for the night farther out in Manila Bay. =Whippoorwill escapes to Borneo= With Philippine waters vulnerable for surface ships, those ships of the Asiatic Fleet that could do so sailed for points south. Whippoorwill headed for Borneo on 12 December and arrived at Balikpapan on the 15th. Four days later, the minecraft—in company with Tulsa, Asheville, and Lark (AM-21)—joined Task Force (TF) 7 and withdrew further south to the Celebes, arriving the next day. Later, Whippoorwill screened Tulsa as the two ships proceeded for Java. Arriving at Surabaya, three days before Christmas of 1941, Comdr. Ferriter went ashore and reported for orders to the Dutch naval commander there. Three days later, the minesweeper commenced local patrols and sweeps out of Surabaya and continued that duty into February 1942, often operating in company with Dutch units, before she received orders to move to Tjilatjap, a port on Java's south coast. =Searching for Langley’s survivors= Arriving early on 26 February, Whippoorwill and Lark put to sea at 1400 the next day to search for survivors of the seaplane tender Langley (AV-3), reportedly sunk south of Java. Three hours out of Tjilatjap, the minesweeper's lookouts sighted a strange vessel and altered course to close and identify her. The mysterious ship turned out to be Tulsa, also searching for Langley survivors. The trio of ships continued their search, the minesweepers steaming independently of the gunboat. At 2229, Whippoorwill and Lark arrived in the area in which Langley had been reported lost, passed a large oil slick, and smelled a strong odor of gasoline and oil—mute testimony to the tragedy that had gone before. =Rescuing survivors of the SS City of Manchester= On the following day, the last day of February, the minesweepers abandoned their search and were about to put about to return to Tjilatjap. At 0507, however, lookouts noted a pulsating fire on the horizon; and the minesweepers closed cautiously. The burning vessel turned out to be the British merchantman City of Manchester—of the Ellerman Line—that had been torpedoed and gunned by the Japanese submarine I-153. Whippoorwill lowered a boat at 0550 and rescued the British sailors from their rafts and life boats. Ten injured men were transferred to Tulsa, which had also arrived on the scene of the rescue—the gunboat having a well- equipped sick bay that the minesweepers lacked. Following that rescue mission, Whippoorwill returned to Tjilatjap, arriving on 1 March, only to stand out later that day as Java, too, was becoming more untenable with each passing hour. Subsequently Whippoorwill crept southward towards Australia. =Whippoorwill makes it to Australia= Whippoorwill dropped anchor at Fremantle on 9 March and operated out of Fremantle into May before she shifted to Albany. The minesweeper conducted local patrols and guardship operations in the shipping channels and harbors there from mid-May to late August when she returned to Fremantle. For the remainder of 1942, Whippoorwill operated alternatively at Exmouth Bay, Albany, or Fremantle, patrolling locally and towing targets. On occasion, she acted as reference vessel for submarines of the Southwest Pacific forces on their training cruises. The beginning of 1943 found Whippoorwill engaged in local patrol operations out of Exmouth Gulf, and she continued that duty until February, when she made another brief visit to Fremantle. On 18 and 19 February 1943, she engaged in night exercises with American submarines on maneuvers. Six days later, while underway off the coast, she encountered a cyclone which wrenched two 300-pound depth charges from their tracks. =Antisubmarine action= After returning to Exmouth Gulf, she remained there through March 1943 before sailing for Fremantle and a six- day drydocking period. Upon completion of this brief refit, she returned to Exmouth Gulf on 24 April and conducted minesweeping operations in the area. On 15 May, while en route to Fremantle, she picked up an echo with her sonar gear and came to general quarters. She dropped depth charges but lost the contact. Arriving at Fremantle two days later, 17 May, she commenced a series of antisubmarine patrols which lasted into November. =Reclassified as an ocean- going tug= On 1 December, she began an extensive refit. During the yard work, she was reclassified an ocean-going tug and redesignated AT-169 on 1 March 1944. The long overhaul was completed on 5 March, and the ship proceeded to Brisbane. Coming under the operational control of Commander, Service Force, 7th Fleet, Whippoorwill arrived at Brisbane on 20 March. For the next 10 days, 21 to 31 March 1944, she underwent final conversion to an ocean-going tug. This involved the removal of her minesweeping gear and the addition of a heavy-duty towing engine which had once been fitted on board Dobbin (AD-3). =New Guinea operations= On 8 April, the newly refitted Whippoorwill with LST-385 under tow, got underway for New Guinea, and arrived at Milne Bay with her charge on 15 April. The tug then served Hollandia and at Mios Woendi; also receiving orders to Seeadler Harbor, in the Admiralty Islands, to serve on \\"battle-damage standby\\" duty—prepared to take any battle-damaged ships under tow and out of the front lines. =Philippine Islands operations= Whippoorwill was reclassified an ocean-going tug, old, on 15 May 1944 and designated ATO-169. She then continued operations off New Guinea and in the backwater areas of the war in the Pacific until receiving orders to head north for Leyte in February 1945. Later operating at Hollandia and Ulithi, Whippoorwill resumed operations in the Philippine Islands on 15 June 1945 and served as a harbor tug in the Manila Bay area through the end of the war. Touching at Leyte Gulf, Manila Bay, Zamboanga, and Samar, Whippoorwill finally rounded out her tour in the Philippine Islands on 20 December, when she departed Samar, bound for the Marshall Islands. Arriving at Eniwetok in company with Vireo (ATO-144) and Rail (ATO-139), she departed that island on 4 January 1946, bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving at the Pacific base that had once long served as her home port on the 15th. After a 10-day stay, Whippoorwill in company with Rail, got underway again on 25 January, and headed for San Francisco, California. Post-war inactivation and decommissioning Arriving there on 5 February 1946, Whippoorwill soon began preparation for inactivation and, on 17 April 1946, the ship was decommissioned at San Francisco, California. Struck from the Navy list on 10 June 1946, she was turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal on 6 November 1946. Military awards and honors Whippoorwill was awarded one battle star for her World War II service.

It is accessible only by boat or on foot via an arduous 10 km hike along the coastline from Pleasant Bay, heading north (3.5 to 5 hours hiking), or an even longer, more difficult trek from Meat Cove, heading south (2 to 4 days). The cove features a 1000-metre, sandy beach at the base of a spectacular valley formed by the confluence of Pollett's Cove Brook and another smaller stream. After joining about 1,000 metres above the beach, the streams flow down through a grassy meadow to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is a popular camping and hiking destination. There was a fishing community in the cove for a hundred years.  History  Pollett's Cove by Clara Dennis (c. 1935), Nova Scotia Archives, Canada Pollett's Cove was first inhabited by the Mi'kmaq. During the American Revolution, Ensign S.W. Prenties of the 84th Regiment of Foot wrote the first recorded description of the village. This account is included in Prenties' book about being shipwrecked off the coast of Cape Breton and being saved by Mi'kmaq (1780).Ensign Prenties's Narrative. A Castaway on Cape Breton. Edited by G.

Vol. 11, p. 447Naval Chronicle, Vol. 14, p. 28 The community was first settled by Europeans in 1838. The first European settler to arrive at Pollett's Cove was Donald McLean and his three sons. They were from Scotland and spoke Gaelic. Around 1861, upon returning from Bay St. Lawrence, two of McLean's sons drowned a few hundred yards from the Cove leaving behind their wives and children. (One of these sons was Duncan who was issued the first land grant in the Cove in 1861). J. L. MacDougall. \\"Pleasant Bay\\" in History of Inverness County, Nova Scotia, 1922. Nigel Manley. Pollett's Cove, Cape Breton. 1993. Postmark for Pollett's Cove, Nova Scotia By 1887, there were six families living in the Cove and 9 years later two more families joined the community. These eight families lived in seven houses (1901).Nigel Manley. Pollett's Cove, Cape Breton. 1993.

(There are at least two burial grounds from this period that have preserved gravestone markers.) The 1921 census indicates there was one family in the cove. Another family lived in the Cove for a few years in the 1930s after which the community was likely abandoned. During World War Two Pollett's Cove was connected by a telegraph wire to the rest of Nova Scotia, to warn of German U-boats entering the Gulf of St.Lawrence.J. L.

Preservation  The cove is surrounded by the Cape Breton Highlands. The surrounding land is owned by the province, and has protected wilderness status. However, several hundred acres alongside the beach are privately held. Wild Horses, Pollett's Cove, Nova Scotia In August, 2007, the owners of the main parcel of private land put it up for sale, after failing to conclude negotiations for its purchase by the province. A citizen's group, Friends of Pollett's Cove, was created in September, 2007, with the goal of preserving public access to the cove, while protecting the environment. A Facebook group has also been created with the intention of bridging the gap between the users of Facebook and the Friends of Pollett's Cove.

It used to be a small fishing village, but is today known for its tourism and as a holiday resort.  Early history  Ahrenshoop was first mentioned in 1311 as the defining point of the border of the town of Ribnitz´s property. In 1328 Duke Heinrich II of Mecklenburg donated the area east of this border to the monastery of Ribnitz. In 1395 forces of the City of Rostock destroyed a stronghold, built by Bogislaw VI. of Pomerania, and the harbour of Ahrenshoop. In 1591 the border between Mecklenburg and Pomerania was defined, which runs through the village, still existing today as the \\"Grenzweg\\" (border road). After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 the Eastern part of the village became part of Swedish Pomerania until 1815, when Sweden ceded Pomerania to Prussia. Until the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin joined the German Zollverein in 1868 one had to pay taxes crossing this border. Most of the inhabitants were fishermen or sailors at that time.  Modern times  Evangelical Skipper's Church In 1889 the artist painters Paul Müller-Kaempff and Oskar Frenzel \\"discovered\\" the village, deeply impressed by the landscape and started an artist colony which became increasingly popular among artists such as Marianne Werefkin, Erich Heckel and Gerhard Marcks. The first generation of members of the artist colony included the painters Elisabeth von Eicken, Anna Gerresheim, Friedrich Wachenhusen and, among others, as a guest Karl Rettich. In 1894 Ahrenshoop counted 150 tourists, a number growing to 2158 in 1928. Several artists of the second generation also lived in Althagen and Niehagen, small villages on the Mecklenburg side of the border, among them Gerhard Marcks in Niehagen or Dora Koch-Stetter and her husband :de:Fritz Koch-Gotha in Althagen.

One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 19 *Independent 10 *Liberal Democrats 4 *Labour 1 Background After the last election in 1998 the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats both had 13 councillors, while Labour had 4 seats and there were 4 independents. However following the election five Liberal Democrat councillors, Janet Gott, Ken Hart, Joan Ibbotson, Steve Place and the council leader Carl Lis, all left the party to sit as independent councillors. One Labour councillor Andrew Rankine also became an independent at the same time. Before the 1999 election the Conservatives needed to gain 5 of the 14 seats contested in order to gain a majority on the council. They made two gains when they were the only party to put up candidates in Cowling and Skipton Central wards, which had previously been held by Labour and the Liberal Democrats respectively. While the Conservatives stood a full slate of 14 candidates, the Labour party only stood one candidate at the council election, Janet Gordon in Skipton South. Election result The results saw the Conservatives make a net gain of 6 seats to regain overall control of the council. The only Labour councillor defending her seat, Jan Gordon, was among those to be defeated, losing to Conservative Beryl Beresford. By-elections between 1999 and 2000 A by-election was held in Skipton East on 9 March 2000 after the death of independent councillor Janet Gott.

This Baltic seaside resort on the Darß peninsula is located about halfway between the historic Hanseatic towns of Rostock and Stralsund. It is one of three main settlements on the Darß, the others being the villages of Born and Wieck. Prerow has fine, sandy beaches and a picturesque landscape. It is hard to say where the forest ends and the village begins. The primeval Darß Forest has over 50 km of footpaths and cycle ways, a bridleway and tracks for horse-drawn carriages. West of the forest is West Beach with rugged terrain formed by wind and waves. South of Prerow is the bodden countryside. Visitors can take trips on a steam paddle boat and experience wildlife first-hand, nesting areas and various birds as the seasons change. The seaside resort of Prerow is located within the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park which stretches from Ahrenshoop along the southern coast to the island of Hiddensee. Prerow itself was a fishing village, but has now been a seaside resort for over 130 years. Thanks to its varied climatic environment with the sea, meadows, forest and reeds, combined with good water quality, it was always recognised as a health spa. In 1998, the Minister of Social and Economic Affairs officially recognized the village as a seaside and health resort.  Sights  The village of Prerow, with over 1,600 inhabitants, has become the largest village on the Darß. Its typical thatched roof cottages are well-preserved and have long given the village a serene charm. Prerow boasts the oldest lighthouse in Germany; it celebrated its 160th anniversary in 2008. The other famous landmark, the \\"Seafarers' Church\\", is over 280 years old. It is the oldest building on the Darß peninsula, and was built in 1726/28. It is also the oldest Lutheran church in the region. It hosts Evangelical-Lutheran and Roman Catholic services as well as art exhibitions, guided tours, classical concerts and other special events. Camping on the beach at Prerow in 1990 The Darß Museum was founded in 1953 and various events are held here during the summer months. The museum displays the culture of the region, dominated by its countryside by the sea. Its exhibition contains information about geological history, traditional sailing boats, typical architectural style, flora and fauna.

Traditional house in Prerow Traditional house in Prerow  History of tourism  After the great storm surge of 1872, an intense development of tourism began. Within a few years the number of visitors had risen enormously. The publican, Herrmann Scharmberg, first organized simple swimming facilities. On 12 November 1878 he asked the royal government of Stralsund to establish a Baltic seaside spa. His request was granted. Two years later, in 1880, eighty visitors made their way to the village, which at the time had a population of approximately 1,550. The date is celebrated as the admission of Prerow into the circle of the Baltic resorts. In 2010, Prerow, as the second biggest resort in this region, celebrated 130 years as a seaside resort.

These conflicts began when the first wave of European-American settlers moved into Spanish Texas. They continued through Texas's time as part of Mexico, when more Europeans and Anglo- Americans arrived, to the subsequent declaration of independence by the Republic of Texas. The conflicts did not end until thirty years after Texas joined the United States. Although several Indian tribes occupied territory in the area, the preeminent nation was the Comanche, known as the \\"Lords of the Plains\\". Their territory, the Comancheria, was the most powerful entity and persistently hostile to the Spanish, the Mexicans, and finally, the Texans. These conflicts lasted from 1820, just before Mexico gained independence from Spain, until 1875, when the last free band of Plains Indians, the Comanches led by Quahadi warrior Quanah Parker, surrendered and moved to the Fort Sill reservation in Oklahoma. The half-century struggle between the Plains tribes and the Texans became particularly intense after the Spanish, and then Mexicans, left power in Texas. The Republic of Texas, which had increasing settlement by European Americans, and the United States opposed the tribes. Their war with the Plains Indians was characterized by deep animosity, slaughter on both sides, and, in the end, near-total conquest of the Indians.Native American Texans The Comanche were known as fierce warriors, with a reputation for looting, burning, murdering, and kidnapping as far south as Mexico City. When Sul Ross rescued Cynthia Ann Parker at Pease River, he observed that this event would be felt in every family in Texas, as every one had lost someone in the Indian Wars.Exley, J.A.. \\"Frontier Blood: The Saga of the Parker Family During the American Civil War, when the US Army was unavailable to protect the frontier, the Comanche and Kiowa pushed white settlements back more than 100 miles along the Texas frontier.Frontier Forts > Texas and the Western Frontier Europeans in the mid-1700s. A map showing the range of the Plains Indians near the time of European contact Background Texas developed in the region between two major cultural centers of Pre- Columbian North America. The Southwestern tribes occupied the areas to the west and the Plains tribes occupied areas to the east. Archaeologists have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this region and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. The Pueblo from the upper Rio Grande region were centered west of Texas. The Mississippian culture or Mound Builder region extended along the Mississippi River Valley east of Texas. The Mesoamerica civilization was centered south of Texas. The influence of Teotihuacan in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries.Richardson (2005), p. 9. During the Colonial era, members of new cultures entered and settled in the area; through competition for resources and power, they became adversaries. All were relative newcomers to Texas; Europeans began permanently settling in Texas around the Rio Grande and upwards toward San Antonio and El Paso starting in the late 1600s; they reached Nacogdoches around 1721. The Comanche had not arrived into the northern area of the state until roughly the early 1700s; they did not become the predominant nation in the area until the late 1700s, following their successful adoption of the horse.\\"Timeline of History\\". The University of Texas Institute of Texan Cultures at San Antonio Most other Plains Indians had already arrived by the mid-1700s. =Indians in Texas= The people indigenous to northern Texas including the Panhandle are called the Southern Plains Villagers, including Panhandle culture, who include ancestors of the Wichita peoples. The Tonkawa are a confederacy of tribes indigenous to central Texas. Tribes indigenous to east Texas include the Caddo, including the Adai, Eyeish, Hainai, Kadohadacho, and Nacono, and Kitsai. The Akokisa, Atakapa, Karankawa, and Tamique lived along the Gulf coast. The Plains Apache and Kiowa migrated from the west into present-day Texas prior to European contact. Until around 1650, the Comanche were part of the Shoshone people living along the upper Platte River in present-day Wyoming. The Comanche emerged as a distinct group around 1650. About this time, they acquired the horse, which allowed them greater mobility in their quest for better hunting grounds. Their original migration took them to the southern Great Plains, into a span of territory extending from the Arkansas River to Central Texas. During that time, their population increased dramatically because of the abundance of buffalo, the use of the horse for hunting and fighting, the adoption of other migrating Shoshone, and women and children taken captive during raids and warfare. Ultimately, their warriors made such effective use of the horse that the Comanche became the most powerful Indian nation of the plains. First as Shoshone, their conquest took them to the Southern Plains. There they separated from the Shoshone and emerged as a distinct nation. They based their warfare on speed and calculated violence, developing superb light cavalry skill. In raids, they captured so many children and women of their opponent Indian tribes, keeping and adopting them, that they dramatically increased their population. Those tribes who submitted to Comanche power were given latitude but had to provide food, lodging, and women as tributaries. When the Comanche encountered and entered conflict against Spanish colonists, they blocked Spanish expansion to the east from New Mexico and prevented direct communication with the new Spanish settlements north of the Rio Grande. In turn, the Comanche and eventually Apache allies launched deep raids, sending thousands and, at times, tens of thousands of warriors into Mexico; they successfully captured and enslaved thousands of Mexicans. Eventually, the numbers were so large that Hispanics made up nearly thirty percent of the Comanche nation.Sultzman, Lee (2006). . Comanche History: Part One. Accessed September 7, 2007. The Comanches were decentralized; historically, they did not form a single cohesive tribal unit but were divided into almost a dozen autonomous groups. The 12 bands had as many as 45 distinct divisions. These groups shared the same language and culture but at times fought internally in ritualized combat, even as they cooperated at other times. In the 1740s, Tonkawa, Yojuanes, and others settled along the San Gabriel River.Gary Clayton Anderson, The Indian Southwest, 1580-1830: Ethnogenesis and Reinvention (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999) p. 85 The Tonkawa allied with the Bidais, Caddos, Wichitas, Comanche and Yojuanes in 1758 and attacked and decimated the Lipan Apache and the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá.Anderson, The Indian Southwest, p. 89 Tonkawa landsThe Tonkawa continued their southern migration into Texas and northern Mexico where they then allied with the Lipan Apache.May, Jon D. \\"Tonkawa\\" , Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture, Tulsa: Oklahoma Historical Society (retrieved 8 Feb 2009) Also during the 1740s in the Southwest, Spanish settlers sometimes captured American Indian children. Often it was common practice to have the child baptized and then adopt them into their homes, where they were raised to be servants. At first the practice involved primarily Apaches and eventually Comanche children were likewise adopted as servants.de la Teja (1956), p. 123. Prior 1750, the Apaches were highly influential in west Texas, But this changed with the Comanche incursions. Beginning in the 1740s, the Comanche began crossing the Arkansas River and established themselves on margins of the Llano Estacado. This area extended from southwestern Oklahoma across the Texas Panhandle into New Mexico. The Apaches were driven out in a series of wars, and the Comanche came to control the area. This domain extended south from the Arkansas River across central Texas to the vicinity of San Antonio, including the entire Edwards Plateau west to the Pecos River and then north again following the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Arkansas River. Comanche territory c.1850 After driving out the Apaches, the Comanches were stricken by a smallpox epidemic from 1780–1781. As the epidemic was very severe, the Comanche temporarily suspended raids, and some Comanche divisions were disbanded. A second smallpox epidemic struck during the winter of 1816–1817. The best estimates are that more than half the total population of the Comanche were killed by these epidemics.Fehrenbach, T.R. Comanches, The Destruction of a People In response to this devastating loss of numbers, the Comanche effectively allied with the Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache, after one Kiowa warrior spent a fall season with the Comanche in 1790. Fehrenbach believed the union came from the necessity to protect their hunting grounds from settler incursions. First, the Kiowa and the Comanche agreed to share hunting grounds and unite in war. The Kiowa Apache, as allies of the Kiowa, ultimately joined this alliance. Eventually, the three tribes agreed to share the same hunting grounds and had a mutual self-defense and war pact. The Alabama and Koasati migrated into eastern Texas beginning in the 1780s, and today are the federally-recognized Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas. =Europeans in Texas= New Spain in 1819 Texan colonists European and especially mixed-race Mexican colonists reached Texas prior to the end of Spanish rule. Colonial authorities did not encourage colonization in this area, as it was too far from their bases. The number of colonists was extremely limited, and they were always at risk of Comanche raids. By the early 1800s, as a result of the Comanche wars, the Mexican wars of Independence, and the collapse of colonial power, Mexican resistance to Comanche attacks had almost collapsed. In contrast to the neglected military capabilities of the Mexicans, authorities considered Americans as extremely aggressive in combat and they were subsequently encouraged to establish settlements on the frontier in present-day Texas as a defensive bulwark to Comanche raids further south. Although most of these early Americans were ultimately killed, executed or driven from Texas by Spanish authorities during the Green Flag Republic, the Comanche's subsequent raids deep into Mexico, showed the practicality of Americans in holding the frontier. Consequently, the new regime quickly recruited Americans, the first of which was Stephen F. Austin, who was given a Spanish land grant in Texas. When Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, its government continued to recruit Americans, as it wanted to develop its depopulated northern provinces. Early Texas colonization: Mexican Texas 1821–1836 Stephen F. Austin, known as the \\"Father of Texas\\" In the 1820s, seeking additional colonists as a means of conquering the area, Mexico reached an agreement with Stephen F. Austin reauthorizing his Spanish land grants. That allowed several hundred American families to move into the region. As Austin used his network and government sponsors to spread the word of rich lands in Texas, thousands of additional colonists from the United States flooded into the region, many illegally. Many had no interest in being ruled by the government of Mexico. In 1829, when Mexico abolished slavery throughout Mexico, the immigrants from the U.S. were exempted in some colonies or actively evaded governmental efforts to enforce this abolition in the territory. Under the change, many slaves in Mexico at this time were reclassified as indentured servants, with the longterm goal of freedom. Americans did not like this policy and also objected to the central government's actions in tightening political and economic control over the territory. Eventually these tensions resulted in the Texas Revolution. In 1821, while colonists were still welcome, Jose Francisco Ruiz negotiated a truce with the Penatucka Comanche, the band closest to the settlements in East and Central Texas. Following that truce, he was able to complete a treaty of peace and friendship, which was signed in Mexico City in December 1821. But, within twelve months the Mexican Government failed to pay the presents promised to the Pentucka, who resumed raiding at once. For the same reason, failure to pay promised tributes, the peace treaties signed for New Mexico broke down. By 1823 war raged the entire length of the Rio Grande. Most of the remaining Mexican settlements were destroyed; only those in the upper Rio Grande were secured. Thousands of surviving Mexican refugees fled to this area. The Comanche pushed out or killed most Europeans and Mexicans in the region, except the European-American Texans. In 1824, the Tonkawa entered into a treaty with Stephen F. Austin (the Father of Republic of Texas), pledging their support against the Comanche Tribe. The Mexican government negotiated additional treaties, signed in 1826 and 1834, but in each case failed to meet the terms of the agreements. Although such events would've proved catastrophic in early years as the Comanche raided towards Mexico City, the presence of American militias obstructed such attacks, thereby encouraging the Mexicans to become dilatory in payments. Because Comanche raiding was based on taking booty and captives, the proximity of American communities' proved more fruitful to Comanche raiding. Although Texan military force was much stronger than previous Mexican colonists, the sheer rapidity of advance and large numbers of the raiders overwhelmed many of these early Texan colonization. For in 1826, Comanches had raided and burned Green DeWitt's new town of Gonzales to the ground. During the entire period of 1821 to 1835, colonists had difficulty with Comanche raids, despite the formation of full-time militia ranger companies in 1823. Tonkawa and Delaware Indians, enemies of the Comanche, allied with the new immigrants, trying to gain allies themselves against these traditional enemies. The Comanche detested the Tonkawa, in particular, for allegedly being cannibals. As early as 1823, Austin recognized the need to have specific forces designated to fight the Plains tribes, especially the Comanche. They did not distinguish between Mexicans and Americans in their raids. Austin created the first militia Rangers by hiring 10 men; they were paid to fight Indians and protect the colonial settlements. Soon the colonists organized additional Ranger companies. After the Republic was created, this trend continued. Without the resources for a standing army, Texas created small ranger companies mounted on fast horses to pursue and fight Comanches on their own terms. =Fort Parker raid= On May 19, 1836, a huge war party of Comanche, Kiowa, Wichita, and Delaware attacked the colonist outpost of Fort Parker. Completed in March 1834, it had been regarded by the colonists as a strong-point, sufficient to protect them from any Native Americans not observing the peace treaties. Elder John Parker had negotiated with local Indians. Unfortunately for the immigrants, because these Native Americans were subject nations to the Comanche, the tribe did not feel bound to observe the peace. The killing of colonist militia at Fort Parker also resulted in the Comanche taking two women and three children as captives. The Parkers were well known, and the destruction of most of their clan produced shock throughout Texas. Comanche braves, c. 1867–1874. Survivors, especially James W. Parker, called for vengeance and help to recover the captives. This event took place near the close of the Texas Revolution and Texan victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. Most Texans were busy trying to return to what was left of their former homes, and dealing with their own losses, as well as skirmishes with the retreating Mexican army. The Republic of Texas era: 1836–1845 The Republic of Texas era with the Indians can be divided into three phases: the diplomacy of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Online at Google Books Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it was worth it to buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it might not be able to defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help. Texans were disturbed by accounts of the continued captivity of thousands of children and women, especially because of the stories by those rescued or ransomed. They made increased demands for the Republic to retaliate against the Comanche. Under Lamar, the Republic of Texas waged war on the Comanche, invaded Comancheria, burned villages, attacked and destroyed numerous war bands, but the effort bankrupted the fledgling Republic. More importantly, although the Texas forces succeeded in rescuing large numbers of hostages, thousands remained in captivity. Houston was elected to his second term in large part because of the failure of Lamar's Indian policies. =First Houston administration: 1836–38= Houston's first Presidency was focused on maintaining The Republic of Texas as an independent country. He had no resources to fight a full-scale war against the Plains Indians.\\"Houston, Samuel\\", Handbook of Texas Online Sam Houston had spent much of his childhood with the Cherokee Indians in Tennessee, among them the Cherokee chief The Bowl.Howard O. Pollan, \\"The Cherokees of Texas: Cherokee, Henderson & Smith Counties, TX\\", East Texas Family Records, Vol. 6, No. 3, Fall 1982, East Texas Genealogical Society, at US GenWeb, accessed 30 May 2014 Chief Bowles was also known as Diwal'li or Di'wali, meaning bowl.\\"Chief Bowles (1756–1839)\\", Legends of America Bowles later led a group of Cherokee who migrated into Texas, trying to escape from Indian Removal out of the Southeast United States. Houston supported the \\"Solemn Declaration\\", which gave the Cherokee rights to the land in Texas on which they lived. He negotiated a treaty with the Cherokee and other tribes on February 23, 1836, in Chief \\"General\\" Bowles' village. It was the first treaty made by the Republic of Texas. Sam Houston and John Forbes signed for the Texas government and Chief Bowles, Big Mush, Samuel Benge, Osoota, Corn Tassel, The Egg, John Bowles (the Chief's son) and Tenuta signed for the Cherokee and allied tribes, including Shawnee, Delaware, Kickapoo, Quapaw, Biloxi, Ioni, Alabama, Coushatta, Caddo of Neches, Tahocullake, and Mataquo. The areas granted in the treaty included present-day Smith and Cherokee counties and parts of Van Zandt, Rusk and Gregg counties. The treaty stated that these lands could not be sold or leased to anyone who was not a member of the tribe, including Texas citizens. After the signing of this Treaty, Sam Houston presented Chief Bowles with a sword, a red silk vest, and a sash. One of Houston's first acts as president of the republic was to send the treaty to be ratified by the Texas Senate. After the treaty stalled in the Senate for a year, lawmakers decided that it would be detrimental to the citizens of Texas, reportedly because settler David G. Burnet had already been granted a tract of land within what were defined as Cherokee treaty lands. The treaty was declared \\"null and void\\" on December 26, 1837. Throughout his presidency, Houston tried to restore the provisions of the treaty and asked General Thomas J. Rusk, commander of the Texas militia, to delineate the boundary. He was unsuccessful in this effort, and Houston could take no more action on the matter before his presidency ended. During Houston's presidency, the Texas Rangers fought the Battle of Stone Houses against the Kichai on November 10, 1837; they were outnumbered and defeated.Stone Houses, Battle of. The Handbook of Texas Online. (retrieved 6 Sept 2009) Comanches of West Texas in war regalia, c. 1830. The Indian problems of the first Houston administration were symbolized by the Córdova Rebellion. Evidence existed that a widespread conspiracy of Cherokee Indians and Mexicans had united to rebel against the new Republic of Texas, and rejoin Mexico. Houston refused to believe that his friends among the Cherokee were involved, and refused to order them arrested. He used them to neutralize the anti-Texans among the group, identifying the Mexican network and having its members killed. The Cordova Rebellion was an example of Houston's ability to quash it without much bloodshed or wide unrestKreneck, Thomas (2000). . \\"Texas Handbook Online September 7, 2007. When Houston left office, the Texans were at peace with the Indians, but many captives were still held by the tribe's bands. During Houston's first presidency, the Texas Congress passed laws opening up all Indian lands to white settlement, and overrode Houston's veto. The settlement frontier quickly moved north along the Brazos, Colorado, and Guadalupe rivers, into Comanche hunting ranges and the borders of Comancheria. Soon the Texan-Comanche relationship was turning violent. Houston made efforts to restore peace and the Comanches, alarmed at the vigor of Texan settlement, began to consider demanding a fixed boundary, contrary to their traditional notions about borders. However, Houston was forbidden by Texas law to yield any land claimed by the Republic. He still made peace with the Comanche in 1838. Online at Google Books =Lamar presidential policy: 1838–41= Mirabeau Bonaparte Lamar, second president of the Republic of Texas, was hostile toward the natives. Lamar's cabinet boasted that it would remove Houston's \\"pet\\" Indians. In 1839, Lamar announced his policy: \\"The white man and the red man cannot dwell in harmony together\\", he said, \\"Nature forbids it.\\"Siegel, Stanley. The Poet President of Texas: The Life of Mirabeau B. Lamar, President of the Republic of Texas His answer to the 'Indian Problem' was: \\"to push a rigorous war against them; pursuing them to their hiding places without mitigation or compassion, until they shall be made to feel that flight from our borders without hope of return, is preferable to the scourges of war.\\"Dial, Steve (2005).\\"Texas Beyond History: The Die is Cast\\", September 7, 2007. President Lamar was the first official of Texas to attempt \\"removal\\", the deportation of Indian tribes to places beyond the reach of white settlers. As carried out, the policy was based on establishing a permanent Indian frontier, i.e., a line beyond which the various \\"removed\\" tribes would be able to carry on their lives free from white settlement or attacks. Lamar became convinced that the Cherokee could not be allowed to stay in Texas after their part in the 1838-39 Córdova Rebellion (and after some disaffected Cherokee carried out the 1838 Killough massacre). The Cherokee War and subsequent removal of the Cherokee from Texas began shortly after Lamar took office. Cherokee War: 1838–39 Lamar demanded that the Cherokee, who had been promised title to their land if they remained neutral during the Texas War of Independence, voluntarily relinquish their lands and all their property, and move to the Indian Territory of the United States. Houston, who had promised the Cherokee during the Córdova Rebellion that they would be given their promised titles, protested, but in vain. In May 1839, Lamar's administration learned of a letter in the possession of Manuel Flores, an agent of the Mexican Government, exposing plans by officials to enlist the Indians against the Texas settlers. Supported by popular opinion in the Republic, Lamar decided to expel the Cherokee Indians from East Texas. When they refused, he used force to compel their removal.Fort Tours  Cherokee War and Battle of Neches =Battle of Neches= On July 12, 1839, the Militia sent a peace commission to negotiate for the Indians' removal. The Cherokee reluctantly agreed to sign a treaty of removal that guaranteed to them the profit from their crops and the cost of the removal. During the next 48 hours the Cherokee insisted they would leave peacefully, but refused to sign the treaty because of a clause in the treaty that would require that they be escorted out of Texas under armed guard. On July 15, 1839, under orders from the Militia, the commissioners told the Indians that the Texans would march on their village immediately and that those willing to leave peacefully should fly a white flag. On July 15 and 16 of 1839, a combined Militia force under General K. H. Douglass, Ed Burleson, Albert Sidney Johnston and David G. Burnet attacked the Cherokees, Delaware, and Shawnee under Cherokee Chief Bowles at the Battle of the Neches. The Indians attempted to resist at the village, and when that failed, tried to re-form, which also failed. Approximately 100 Indians were killed, including Chief Bowles, to only three Militia. When killed, Chief Bowles was carrying a sword given to him by Sam Houston. After the battle, the Cherokee fled to the Choctaw Nation, and northern Mexico meaning East Texas was virtually free of organized communities of Indians, and their lands guaranteed by treaty, were given to American settlers. Lamar and the Plains tribes Lamar's success in ethnically cleansing the Cherokee, a neutral tribe, from Texas emboldened him to do the same with the Plains tribes. Lamar needed an army to carry out his Indian policies, and he set out to build one, at great cost. But at independence, the best estimates were that the Republic had 30,000 Anglo-Americans and Hispanic residents. The Cherokee had less than 2,000 tribesmen in Texas, so removal of them was not a terrible drain on the Republic, especially since the \\"Cherokee War\\" was relatively brief and bloodless for Texas, though certainly not for the Cherokee. The Comanche and Kiowa however, had in the 1830s a population estimated between 20,000 and 30,000. They were well supplied with high-quality firearms and had a large surplus of horses. In addition, by the 1830s the Comanche had established a large network of Indian allies and a vast trading network. Online at Google Books The Republic had a militia but no standing army, and its tiny navy had been greatly decreased during Houston's presidency. Lamar had neither the manpower nor the money to pursue his policy after the Cherokee War, but was not deterred. Lamar's two-year term was marked by escalating violence between the Comanche and colonists. There were not enough Rangers to battle the Comanche at Palo Duro Canyon, for instance, where they could catch them during winter. At the end of 1839 however, some of the Comanche Peace Chiefs of the Penateka Band had come to believe that they could not drive the colonists completely from their homes as the tribe had the Apache. Cheyenne and Arapaho attacks along the northern border of Comanche territory coupled with huge losses in the two preceding generations in several smallpox epidemics had the Penateka Peace Chiefs convinced a treaty might be in their best interests. Additionally, they now realized the huge importance the captive Texans held by the Comanches, had in the Texan imagination. Thus, they reasoned great concessions could be gained from the Texans. Consequently, the Comanche offered, to meet with the Texans, in an effort to negotiate peace in return for a recognized boundary between the Republic and the Comancheria and the return of the hostages. The most notable Penateka War Chief, Potsʉnakwahipʉ (\\"Buffalo Hump\\") disagreed with this decision, and did not trust Lamar or his representatives. None of the other 11 Bands of the Comanche were involved in the peace talks at all. The decision of Peace Chiefs from one band of the Comanche to negotiate, as well as the offer of returning of the hostages, appears to have convinced Lamar that the Comanche tribe was ready to surrender the hostages. However, the majority of past negotiations concerning the return of hostages were never honored by the Comanche who obtained concessions but didn't return the hostages or dragged out indefinitely the return of them. His Secretary of War issued instructions which make clear that Lamar expected the Comanche to act in good faith in returning the hostages, and to yield to his threats of force. To that end, Lamar's Secretary of War, Albert Sidney Johnston, sent militia to San Antonio, with explicit instructions. Johnston, Secretary of War, wrote Lieutenant Colonel William S. Fisher, commanding the 1st Regiment of Infantry: > Should the Comanche come in without bringing with them the Prisoners, as it > is understood they have agreed to do, you will detain them. Some of their > number will be dispatched as messengers to the tribe to inform them that > those detained, will be held as hostages until the Prisoners are delivered > up, then the hostages will be released.Council House Fight Council House Slaughter Thirty-three Penateka chiefs and warriors, accompanied by 32 other Comanches, virtually all of whom were family members or retainers, arrived in San Antonio on March 19, 1840. None of the bands except the Penateka arrived at the meeting. However, they were the pre-eminent band and understood to be the primary leadership of the nation, and were expected to hold the ability of rounding up the hostages. When the Comanche representatives arrived at San Antonio in March 1840, following instructions from the Lamar administration, Commissioners of the Texas government demanded the return of all captives held by the Penateka. In addition, Texas officials insisted that the Comanches abandon Central Texas, cease interfering with Texan settlements, cease conspiring with Mexicans, and avoid all white settlements. The prominent Penateka Peace Chief and medicine man Mukwooru (\\"Spirit Talker\\") was in charge of the delegation. The Comanche chiefs at the meeting had brought along one white captive, and several Mexican children who had been captured separately. The white captive was Matilda Lockhart, a 16-year-old girl who had been held prisoner for over a year and a half. Mary Maverick, who helped care for the girl, wrote almost 60 years after the event that Matilda Lockhart had been beaten and raped, and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the 1890s. Reports of abuse are, however, conspicuously missing in primary documents authored by eyewitnesses immediately after the event. Neither Col. Hugh McLeod mentioned any abuse in his report of March 20, 1840 (commenting on the intelligence of the girl, but nothing like a missing nose) nor any other Texas officials at the time nor Matilda Lockhart's own sister-in-law, who was in San Antonio, in a letter written to her own mother shortly after the release. Anderson writes: \\"While published in the 1890s, this description has been used by historians to claim that the massacre came about as a result of the justifiable rage of Texas men. Yet none of the Texas officials claimed this to be the case at the time; evidence of abuse is conspicuously missing in the primary documents. Maverick may have exaggerated Lockhart's condition because of the growing criticism of Texas in the American and European press. The most significant source on Matilda's condition is a brief statement made in a letter by her sister-in- law, Catherine Lockhart, who was in San Antonio. Catherine describes Matilda's release but says nothing of abuse.\\"Anderson (2005), p. 419 Asked about the more than a dozen abducted whites expected to be available for release, Matilda informed the Texians that she knew only about a Mrs. Webster and her two children (who, unknown to her, had just made their escape) and that the Comanche chiefs had decided to ransom them. The Texians believed this was against the conditions for the negotiations which they believed stated that all abducted whites had to be released before the council. The Comanche, of course, had a different view, since the chiefs and bands not in attendance were under no obligation to release anyone, as they had never agreed to anything.Anderson(2005) pp. 181 f. The talks were held at the council house, a one-story stone building adjoining the jail on the corner of Main Plaza and Calabosa (Market) Street.Brice (1987), p. 22. During the council, the Comanche warriors sat on the floor, as was their custom, while the Texans sat on chairs on a platform facing them. Lockhart had informed them that she had seen 15 other prisoners at the Comanche's principal camp several days before. She maintained that the Indians had wanted to see how high a price they could get for her, and that they then planned to bring in the remaining captives one at a time.Brice (1987), p. 23. The Texians demanded to know where the other captives were. The Penateka spokesman, Chief Muguara, responded that the other prisoners were held by differing bands of Comanche. He assured the Texians that he felt the other captives would be able to be ransomed, but it would be in exchange for a great deal of supplies, including ammunition and blankets. He then finished his speech with the comment, \\"how do you like that answer?\\"Noyes (1993), p. 282. The Texian militia entered the courtroom and positioned themselves at intervals on the walls.Noyes (1993), p. 283. When the Comanches would not, or could not, promise to return all captives immediately, the Texas officials said that chiefs would be held hostage until the white captives were released. The interpreter warned the Texian officials that if he delivered that message, the Comanches would attempt to escape by fighting. He was instructed to relay the warning and left the room as soon as he finished translating. After learning that they were being held hostage, the Comanches attempted to fight their way out of the room using arrows and knives. The Texian soldiers opened fire at point-blank range, killing both Indians and whites. The Comanche women and children waiting outdoors began firing their arrows after hearing the commotion inside. At least one Texian spectator was killed. When a small number of warriors managed to leave the council house, all of the Comanche began to flee. The soldiers who followed again opened fire, killing and wounding both Comanche and Texians. Armed citizens joined the battle, but, claiming they could not always differentiate between warriors and women and children, since all of the Comanche were fighting, shot at all the Comanche.Noyes (1993), p. 284. According to Anderson, such \\"confusion\\" between Native American men and women was convenient to the Texians, who used it as an excuse to kill women and children.Anderson (2005), pp. 181 f. According to the report by Col. Hugh McLeod, written March 20, 1840, of the 65 members of the Comanches' party, 35 were killed (30 adult males, three women, and two children), 29 were taken prisoner (27 women and children, and two old men), and one departed unobserved (described as a renegade Mexican).Hugh McLeod's Report on the Council House Fight, March 1840 - Page 3 - Texas State Library Seven Texians died, including a judge, a sheriff, and an army lieutenant, with 10 more wounded. Aftermath of the Council House Fight: the Great Raid and Plum Creek As revenge for the killing of 33 Comanche chiefs at the Council House Fight, all but three of the remaining captives held by the Indians were executed slowly by torture; the three who were spared had been previously adopted into the tribe.University of Texas.Comanche Nation . Potsʉnakwahipʉ (\\"Buffalo Hump\\") wished to exact further revenge and gathered his own warriors, and sent messengers to all the Bands of the Comanche, all the divisions of the Bands, and the Kiowa and Kiowa Apache. Possibly all the most important and renowned Comanche chiefs joined the raid: the Penateka Isaviah (\\"Yellow Wolf\\") - Potsʉnakwahipʉ's cousin and fellow -, the Kotsoteka Wulea-boo (\\"Shaved Head\\"), if not Tawaquenah (\\"Big Eagle\\" or \\"Sun Eagle\\"), the Nokoni Huupi-pahati (\\"Tall Tree\\") and his second chief Quenaevah (\\"Eagle Drink\\" or \\"Drinking Eagle\\"), the Quahadi Puhihwikwasu'u (\\"Iron Jacket\\"), the Yamparika Pawʉʉrasʉmʉnunʉ (\\"Ten Bears\\"), and many younger war chiefs as the Penateka Tosahwi (\\"White Knife\\", \\"Silver Knife\\" or \\"Silver Brooch\\") and the Nokoni Tʉhʉyakwahipʉ aka Kiyou (\\"Horseback\\"). Gathering around 500 warriors and another 400 women and boys to provide comfort and do the work, Buffalo Hump took his gigantic war party and raided all the way from the Edwards Plateau to the sea.The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. Burning and looting Victoria and Linnville, then the second biggest port in Texas, the Comanches gathered thousands of horses and mules, and a fortune in goods from the Linnville warehousesRoell, Craig (2002). . \\"Texas Handbook Online September 7, 2007. The population of Linnville prudently fled to the waters of the Gulf, where they watched helplessly while the Comanche looted the town and burned it. At Plum Creek, near Lockhart, Texas, the Rangers and Militia caught up to the Comanche. Several hundred Militia under Mathew Caldwell and Ed Burleson, plus all Ranger companies and their Tonkawa allies engaged the war party in a huge running gun battle, as the Comanche tried to safeguard their loot, and the Militia tried to destroy the Indians. Ironically, again according to military historians, the same thing, greed, that had driven the Comanche into being the preeminent warriors of the plains, now made them vulnerable. The Rangers and Militia overran the Comanche guarding their loot and eventually in a running gun-fight recovered several dozen captives held by the Comanche and eventually recovered mules with several hundred thousand dollars in bullion on them. The remainder of the Lamar Presidency was spent in daring but exhausting round of raids and rescue attempts, managing to recover several dozen more captives. Buffalo Hump continued his war against the Texans, and Lamar hoped for another pitched battle to use his Rangers and Militia to remove the Plains tribes. The Comanche, however, had learned from Plum Creek, and had no intention of ever massing again for the Militia to use cannon and massed rifle fire on. Lamar spent an incredible 2.5 million dollars against the Comanche in 1840 alone – more than the entire revenue of the Republic during Lamar's two-year term. =The second Houston presidency: 1841–44= When Sam Houston left the presidency of Texas the first time, the population seemed to support Lamar's strong anti-Indian policies. After the Great Raid and hundreds of lesser raids, with the Republic bankrupt, and all of the captives either recovered or murdered by the Indians, Texans turned away from continuation of war and toward more diplomatic initiatives by electing Houston to his second presidency. Houston's Indian policy was to disband the vast majority of the regular Army troops, but muster four new companies of Rangers to patrol the frontier. Houston ordered the Rangers to protect the Indian lands from encroachment by settlers and illegal traders. Houston wanted to do away with the cycle of rage and revenge that had spiraled out of control under Lamar. Under Houston's policies, Texas Rangers were authorized to punish severely any infractions by the Indians, but they were never to initiate such conflict. When depredations occurred to either side, the troops were ordered to find and punish the actual perpetrators, rather than retaliating against innocent Indians simply because they were Indians. Houston set out to negotiate with the Indians. The Caddos were the first to respond, and in August 1842, a treaty was reached. Houston then expanded it to all tribes except the Comanche, who still wanted permanent war. In March 1843, Houston reached agreement with the Delaware, Wichitas, and other tribes. At that point, Buffalo Hump, who trusted Houston, began to talk. In August 1843, a temporary treaty accord led to a ceasefire between the Comanches and their allies, and the Texans. In October 1843, the Comanches agreed to meet with Houston to try to negotiate a treaty similar to the one just concluded at Fort Bird. (That this included Potsʉnakwahipʉ \\"Buffalo Hump\\", after the events at the Council House, showed extraordinary Comanche belief in Houston) In early 1844, Buffalo Hump and other Comanche leaders, including Santa Anna and Old Owl, signed a treaty at Tehuacana Creek in which they agreed to surrender white captives in total, and to cease raiding Texan settlements. In exchange for this, the Texans would cease military action against the tribe, establish more trading posts, and recognize the boundary between Texas and Comanchería.Treaty Negotiations – Texas State Library Comanche allies, including the Waco, Tawakoni, Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, and Wichita, also agreed to join in the treaty. By the end of his second term as President, Houston had spent less than $250,000, but brought peace to the frontier, and a treaty between the Comanches and their allies, and the Republic awaited only the United States legislature's ratification for statehood. =The Jones presidency: 1845 to the end of the Republic= The remaining period of the Republic of Texas under President Anson Jones, had the government follow Houston's policies, with the exception that Jones, like most Texas politicians, did not wish to put a boundary on the Comancheria, thus he supported those in the Legislature who derailed that provision of the treaty. End of the Republic, beginning of the United States in Texas: 1845–1861 After the Texas Senate removed the boundary provision from the final version of the treaty, Buffalo Hump repudiated it and hostilities resumed. That was one of the last acts of the Senate, as Texas agreed to annexation by the United States. On February 28, 1845, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that would authorize the United States to annex the Republic of Texas. Texas became a U.S. state on the same day annexation took effect, December 29, 1845.The Avalon Project at Yale Law School: Texas – From Independence to Annexation One of the primary motivations for annexation on the Republic of Texas side was that the Republic had incurred huge debts which the United States agreed to assume upon annexation. In 1852, in return for this assumption of debt, a large portion of Texas-claimed territory, now parts of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Wyoming, was ceded to the Federal government. The entry of the Republic into the United States marked the beginning of the end for the Plains Indians. The United States had the resources and manpower to realistically apply a policy of \\"removal\\", and they did so. Finally, in May 1846 Buffalo Hump became convinced that even he could not continue to defy the massed might of the United States, and the State of Texas, so he led the Comanche delegation to the treaty talks at Council Springs that signed a treaty with the United States.Handbook of Texas Online – BUFFALO HUMP As war chief of the Penatucka Comanches, Buffalo Hump dealt peacefully with American officials throughout the late 1840s and 1850s. He negotiated a non-government peace treaty with John O. Meusebach in 1847. In 1849 he guided John S. Ford's expedition part of the way from San Antonio to El Paso, and in 1856 he sadly and finally led his people to the newly established Comanche reservation on the Brazos River. Continuous raids from white horse thieves and squatters, coupled with his band's unhappiness over their lack of freedom and the poor food provided on the reservation, forced Buffalo Hump to move his band off the reservation in 1858. =Murder of Robert Neighbors= During this period, when settlers began to actually attack the Indians on the reservations established in Texas, federal Indian Agent in Charge Robert Neighbors became hated among white Texans. Neighbors alleged that the United States Army officers located at the posts of Fort Belknap and Camp Cooper, near the reservations, failed to give adequate support to his resident agents and him, and adequate protection to the Indians. In spite of continuous threats of various people to take his life, Neighbors never faltered in his determination to do his duty, and carry out the law to protect the Indians.Handbook of Texas Online – NEIGHBORS, ROBERT SIMPSON With the aid of federal troops, whom he finally shamed and politically forced to assist him, he managed to hold back the white people from the reservations. Convinced, however, that the Indians would never be safe in Texas, he determined to move them to safety in the Indian territories. In August 1859, he succeeded in moving the Indians without loss of life to a new reservation in Indian Territory. Forced to return to Texas on business, he stopped at the village near Fort Belknap. On September 14, 1859, while he was speaking with one settler, a man named Edward Cornett shot him in the back while he was talking to the first man, and killed him. Historians believe his assassination was a direct result of his actions protecting the Comanche. Neighbors probably did not even know his assassin. He was buried in the civilian cemetery at Fort Belknap.Comanche-Part Three =The Antelope Hills campaign and Little Robe Creek: 1858= The years 1856–58 were particularly vicious and bloody on the Texas frontier as settlers continued to expand their settlements into the Comanche homeland, the Comancheria, and 1858 was marked by the first Texan incursion into the heart of the Comancheria, the so-called Antelope Hills campaign, marked by the Battle of Little Robe Creek. This battle signaled the beginning of the end of the Comanche as a viable people, as they were attacked in the heart of their domain, in force. Valuable Indian hunting grounds were plowed under, and grazing range for the Comanche horse herds lost. The Comanche realized their homeland of the Comancheria was increasingly encroached on by Texas settlers, and incidents such as the attack on Potsʉnakwahipʉ \\"Buffalo Hump\\"'s camp showed the Comanches off the reservation they could expect no protection on it – and they struck back with a series of ferocious and bloody raids into Texas. By 1858, only five of the twelve Comanche bands still existed, and one, the Penateka, had dwindled to only a few hundred on the reservation. Realizing their way of life was disappearing, the remaining free Comanche struck back with incredible violence. The U.S. Army proved wholly unable to stem the violence. Federal units were being transferred out of the area for reasons that seemed driven more by political than military considerations. At the same time, federal law and numerous treaties forbade incursion by state forces into the federally protected Indian Territories. The U.S. Army was likewise instructed not to attack Indians in the Indian Territories or to permit such attacks. The reasoning behind the order was that many native tribes, such as the Cherokee, were engaged in farming, and living as peaceful settlers. Other tribes, such as the Comanche and Kiowa, continued to use that part of the Indian Territories that was the Comancheria to live in while raiding white settlements in Texas.The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. The relationship between the federal government, Texas and the native tribes was further complicated by a unique legal issue which arose as a result of Texas' annexation. The federal government is charged by the U.S. Constitution to be in charge of Indian affairs and took over that role in Texas after it became a state in 1846. But under the terms of Texas' accession to the Union, the new state retained control of its public lands. In all other new states, Washington controlled both public lands and Indian affairs and so could make treaties guaranteeing reservations for various groups. In Texas, however, the federal government could not do this. Texas adamantly refused to contribute public land for Indian reservations within the boundaries of Texas, meanwhile expecting the federal government to be responsible for the cost and details of Indian affairs. Since federal Indian agents in Texas knew that Indian land rights were the key to peace on the frontier, no peace could be possible with the uncooperative attitude of Texas officials on the question of Indian homelands.Handbook of Texas Online. Texas State Historical Association  Campaign in the Antelope Hills: Texans invade the Comancheria, 1858  The loss of the 2nd Cavalry in Texas was a particularly bitter blow to colonists. Texas Governor Hardin Runnels had campaigned for office in 1856 on a platform to put an end to the raids. He publicly expressed astonishment and rage when the 2nd Cavalry was transferred to Utah, and ultimately disbanded altogether. Runnels determined to reestablish disbanded Ranger battalions which had been reduced after Texas' annexation by the United States. On January 27, 1858, Runnels appointed John Salmon \\"Rip\\" Ford, a veteran Ranger of the Mexican–American War and frontier Indian fighter, as captain and commander of the Texas Ranger, Militia, and Allied Indian Forces, and ordered him to carry the battle to the Comanches in the heart of their homeland on the Comancheria. John \\"Rip\\" Ford was made captain and commander of the Texas Ranger, Militia, and Allied Indian Forces Ford was known as a ferocious and brutal Indian fighter. Ford had no trouble ordering the slaughter of villages which resulted in the wholesale slaughter of any Indian, man or woman, he could find. Ford's reason for this was simple: Comanche raids were brutal in their treatment of colonists. Thus, Ford determined to meet brutal raiding with his own greater wholesale slaughter. Runnels issued very explicit orders to Ford, \\"I impress upon you the necessity of action and energy. Follow any trail and all trails of hostile or suspected hostile Indians you may discover and if possible, overtake and chastise them if unfriendly. On March 19, 1858, Ford went to the Brazos Reservation, near what today is the city of Fort Worth, Texas, and recruited the Tonkawa into his forces. Ford and Tonkawa Chief Placido, were determined to follow the Comanche and Kiowa up to their strongholds amid the hills of the Canadian river, and into the Wichita Mountains, and if possible \\"kill their warriors, decimate their food supply, strike at their homes and families and generally destroy their ability to make war\\". In April 1858, Ford established Camp Runnells near what used to be the town of Belknap. Ford, still operating under Runnell's explicits orders to \\"follow any and all trails of hostile and suspected hostile Indians, inflict the most severe and summary punishment\\", and to \\"allow no interference from any source\\". (That source was interpreted to mean the United States, whose Army and Indian Agents might try to enforce federal treaties and federal statutory law against trespassing on the Indian territories in Oklahoma). On April 15, Ford's Rangers, accompanied by Tonkawa warriors, and Anadarko and Shawnee scouts from the Brazos Reservation in Texas, crossed the Red River into Indian Territory. The force then advanced into the portion of the Comancheria in the Indian Territories in Oklahoma. Ford led his men across the Red River, into the Indian Territory, violating federal laws and numerous treaties, but stating later that his job was to \\"find and fight Indians, not to learn geography\\".  Attack on Iron Jacket's Camp at Little Robe Creek  At sunrise on May 12, 1858. Ford and his joint force of Rangers and Tonkawa began an all-day battle with an attack on a Comanche village. The Battle of Little Robe Creek was actually three distinct engagements over the course of a single day. The first was the attack on the first village discovered by the scouts of the Ranger force. The second was a follow-up attack on the larger village (70 tents) of chief Puhihwikwasu'u (\\"Iron Jacket\\"), somewhat farther up the Canadian River. Puhihwikwasu'u (\\"Iron Jacket\\") was killed in this exchange, and the remainder of his village was saved by the intervention of his son, and Quahadi war chief, Peta Nocona (\\"Lone Wanderer\\") with a third force of Comanche who arrived to engage Ford while all the villages along the Canadian made a swift withdrawal. Peta Nocona knew that his warriors were no match for the Rangers in an even exchange of gunfire, and had no intention of engaging in such an exchange. He used every trick available to him, including attempting to lure the Rangers and Tonkawas into individual duels, to delay the enemy so the villages upriver would be able to withdraw safely. In this, he was successful. Potsʉnakwahipʉ (\\"Buffalo Hump\\") and his Penateka, encamped not many miles far, were not involved in the battle. The Battle of Little Robe Creek was notable in that the Texan forces first invaded the United States in violation of federal law and numerous Indian Treaties, attacked villages without warning, and allowed their allied Indians, the Tonkawa, to eat some of the Comanche killed in battle.  Attack on Buffalo Hump's Camp in the Wichita Mountains  On October 1, 1858, while camped in the Wichita Mountains with the Kotsoteka band under Quohohateme, the Yambarika band under Hotoyokowat, and probably the Nokoni band under Quenaevah, the remains of the once mighty Penateka Band, under Potsʉnakwahipʉ (\\"Buffalo Hump\\"), were attacked by United States troops under the command of Maj. Earl Van Dorn. Allegedly not aware that Potsʉnakwahipʉ (\\"Buffalo Hump\\")'s band had recently signed a formal peace treaty with the United States at Fort Arbuckle, Van Dorn and his men killed eighty of the Comanches. This attack on a peaceful camp, housing only Indians who had signed a peace treaty with the United States, was, nonetheless, reported by Van Dorn as a \\"battle\\" with the Comanche, and to this day is chronicled by some historians as the \\"Battle of Wichita Mountains\\". Nonetheless, despite this, an aged and weary Potsʉnakwahipʉ (\\"Buffalo Hump\\") led and settled his remaining followers on the Kiowa-Comanche reservation near Fort Cobb in Indian Territory in Oklahoma. There, in spite of his reported enormous sadness at the end of the Comanches' traditional way of life, he asked for a house and farmland so that he could set an example for his people. Attempting to live out his life as a rancher and farmer, he died in 1870. = Aftermath of Little Robe Creek: 1858–60 = The Battle of Little Robe Creek epitomized Texas Indian fighting in its attitude towards women and children casualties. Ford, accused of killing women and children in every battle he fought against the Plains Indians, shrugged it off by stating it was hard to distinguish \\"warriors from squaws\\"—but morbid jokes of Ford's made clear he did not care about the age or sex of his victims. Ford considered the deaths of settlers, including women and children, during Indian raids, to open the door to make all Indians, regardless of age or sex, combatants. The Tonkawa warriors with the Rangers celebrated the victory by decorating their horses with the bloody hands and feet of their Comanche victims as trophies. \\"The Rangers noted most of their dead foes were missing various body parts, and the Tonkawa had bloody containers, portending a dreadful victory feast that evening.\\".\\" The coat of mail worn by old Iron Jacket covered his dead body \\"like shingles on a roof\\". The Rangers cut up the mail and divided the pieces as trophies.The Battle of Little Robe Creek The attacks in the Antelope Hills showed that the Comanche no longer were able to assure the safety of their villages in the heart of the Comancheria =Reward for the Tonkawa for their alliance with Texans at Little Robe Creek= Other Indians never forgot the Tonkawa's allying with Texan colonists. Despite pleas from the aging Placido to protect his people from their enemies, the Tonkawa were moved from their reservation on the Brazos, and put on a reservation in Oklahoma with the Delaware, Shawnee and Caddo tribes. In 1862, warriors from these tribes united to attack the Tonkawas. 133 out of the remaining 309 Tonkawas were killed in the massacre. Included in the dead was the elderly Placido. Today less than 15 families of Tonkawa remain on their reservation in Oklahoma.Tonkawas – Indians of Central Texas =Battle of Pease River, Recapture of Cynthia Ann Parker: 1860= There are two distinctly different stories about what happened on Mule Creek on December 18, 1860, near the town of Margaret, Texas in Foard County, Texas. The official version is that Sul Ross and his forces managed to catch the Quahadi Band of the Comanche by surprise, and wiped them out, including their leader, Peta Nocona. According to Quanah Parker, however, his father (Peta Nocona) was not present that day, and the Comanches killed were virtually all women and children in a buffalo hide drying and meat curing camp. In any event, all parties agree that at sunrise on December 18, 1860, Rangers and Militia under Sul Ross found and surprised a group of Comanche camped on Mule Creek, a tributary of the Pease River. Almost all (including a gallant warrior who wasn't Peta Nocona, but his loyal Nobah, who died trying to protect his chief's wife - Naduah - and daughter - Topsannah -) were killed except one woman, who, being recognized as a white woman, was allowed to live. She was later discovered to be Cynthia Ann Parker. The only other known survivors were a 10-year-old boy saved by Sul Ross, and Cynthia Parker's infant daughter, \\"Prairie Flower\\". Cynthia Ann Parker was returned to her white family, who watched her very closely to prevent her from returning to her husband and children. After her daughter died from influenza, she starved herself to death when her guardians would not allow her to return to the Comanche to attempt to find her lost sons. The Civil War years on the plains: delay of the conquest: 1861–1865 The Civil War brought incredible bloodshed and chaos to the plains. As the cavalry left Indian Territory for other battles, and many Rangers enlisted in the Confederate Army, the Comanche and other Plains tribes began to push back settlement from the Comancheria. The frontier was eventually pushed back over , and the Texas plains were riddled with abandoned and burned out farms and settlements. The Indian population was not high enough, however, to restore control over all of the Comancheria. =The Elm Creek raid= In the late fall of 1864 in Young County, Texas, a war party of between 500 and 1,000 Comanche and Kiowa headed by Kotsoteka chief Kuhtsu-tiesuat (\\"Little Buffalo\\") raided the middle Brazos River country, destroying 11 farms along the Elm Creek, stealing virtually every cow, horse, and mule in the area, and besieging the citizen stronghold of Fort Murrah. The home-guard managed to hold the fort, and, after Kuhtsu-tiesuat's death in the fight, the war party returned north with 10 women and children captives. Black scout Britt Johnson, whose wife was among the stolen women, went out to look for the prisoners and managed to rescue all of them, with the aid of the friendly Penateka chief Asa-havey (who, after this, became a specialist in this job). =First Battle of Adobe Walls= The first battle of Adobe Walls occurred on November 26, 1864, in the vicinity of Adobe Walls, the ruins of William Bent's abandoned adobe trading post and saloon near the Canadian River in Hutchinson County, Texas. The battle was one of the largest engagements in terms of numbers engaged between whites and Indians on the Great Plains. It came about because Gen. James H. Carleton, commander of the military Department of New Mexico, decided to punish Comanche and Kiowa attacks on Santa Fe wagon trains. The Indians saw the wagon-trains as trespassers who killed buffalo and other game the Indians needed to survive.Trosser, John (2004). . \\"Adobe Walls Texas\\" September 7, 2007. Col. Christopher (Kit) Carson, was given command of the First Cavalry, New Mexico Volunteers, and told to proceed and campaign against the winter campgrounds of the Comanches and Kiowas. The campgrounds in question were reported to be somewhere on the south side of the Canadian River. On November 10, 1864 Carson started from Fort Bascom with 335 cavalry, and seventy-five Ute and Jicarilla Apache scouts. Those Carson had recruited from Lucien Maxwell's ranch near Cimarron, New Mexico. On November 12, 1864, Carson's force, supplied with two mountain howitzers under the command of Lt. George H. Pettis, twenty-seven wagons, an ambulance, and forty-five days' rations, proceeded down the Canadian River into the Texas Panhandle. Carson had decided to march first to Adobe Walls, which he was familiar with from his employment there by Bent over 20 years earlier. Inclement weather, including an early snow storm, caused slow progress, and on November 25, 1864, the First Cavalry reached Mule Springs, in Moore County, approximately 30 miles west of Adobe Walls. Scouts reported the presence of a large Indian encampment at Adobe Walls, and Carson ordered his cavalry forward, to be followed by the wagons and howitzers. Approximately two hours after daybreak on November 26, 1864, Carson's cavalry attacked a Kiowa village of 150 lodges. The Chief, Dohäsan, and his people fled, passing the alarm to allied Comanche villages nearby, while Guipago, young war chief and nephew to Dohasan himself, managed to restrain the enemy. Marching forward to Adobe Walls, Carson dug in there about 10am., using one corner of the ruins for a hospital. Carson discovered to his dismay that there were numerous villages in the area, including one very large Comanche village, with a total of between 3–5,000 Indians, far more opposition than Carson had anticipated. The Kiowa led the first attack, by Dohäsan assisted by Satank (Sitting Bear), Guipago (Lone Wolf), Set-imkia (Stumbling Bear) and Satanta (White Bear); Guipago led the warriors to the first counterattack to protect the fleeing women and children; reportedly Satanta was said to have sounded bugle calls back to Carson's bugler, confusing his signals. Beginning to run low on supplies, Carson ordered his forces to withdraw in the afternoon. The angry Indians tried to block his retreat by firing the grass and brush down near the river. Carson however set back fires and retreated to higher ground, where the twin howitzers continued to hold off the Indians. When twilight came, Carson ordered part of his scouts to burn the lodges of the first village. The Kiowa-Apache chief, Iron Shirt, was killed when he refused to leave his tepee. The army declared Carson's mission a victory, despite his having been driven from the field. =Battle of Dove Creek= On January 18, 1865 a force of Confederate Texans attacked a peaceful tribe of Kickapoos at Battle of Dove Creek, Tom Green County, and were soundly defeated. The final years of the Plains tribes: 1865–1875 See full article in Comanche Campaign =Indian attacks on cowboys= After the Civil War, Texas' growing cattle industry managed to regain much of its economy. Beef became a particular commodity after the war, and supplies from Texas were shipped to other states for a great price. Texas Longhorns were the ones sought after, and the state's open range became their new habitat and breeding ground. Hundreds of ranchers and farms sprang out by the end of the war, and veterans were hired as cowboys to protect cattle. However, exporting the cattle was a dangerous task for the new ranches. The best routes to drive the cattle run straight through the Comanche territory. Relationships between them were mutual; cowboys are permitted to go across as long as they pay the toll.Malone, John William. An Album of the American Cowboy. New York: Franklin Watts, Inc., 1971, p. 42\\\\. However, in times of conflicts or when food are scarce, Indians would attack cowboys and their cattle if ever seen in their land.Carter, Sarah, Cowboys, Ranchers and the Cattle Business: Cross-Border Perspectives on Ranching History, Univ Pr of Colorado (2000) p. 95\\\\. One dire case happened to a black cowboy named Britton Johnson in 1864. His ranch was raided upon by a band of Comanches, who killed his son and kidnapped his wife and daughter. Although Johnson managed to negotiate with them for his family, the Comanches never left him alone. A band of 25 warriors attacked Johnson again with two of his cowboys during a routine cattle drive. Although they put up a fight, all of them perished during their last stand.Lewis, Mary C. Ebony Jr., Black Settlers of the Old West. Johnson Publication. May 1984 . pp.18-19 Another well-documented attack happened in the Spring of 1867.Richard Melzer, Buried Treasures: Famous and Unusual Gravesites in New Mexico History, Santa Fe, New Mexico: Sunstone Press, 2007, p. 105 Ranchers Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, together with their cowboys, attempted to drive their livestock around Comancheria in the trail now known as the Goodnight–Loving Trail. During the journey, Loving had to separate from the group to scout ahead. This proved to be fatal as Loving and his ranch hand were soon attacked by 200 armed Comanche warriors patrolling the border. Loving made his last stand in the Pecos River to allow his cowboy to get help. Although Loving managed to escape the onslaught, he was mortally wounded and died soon after. Goodnight on the other hand, also had to face raids along the way, once being wounded during an attack together with another fellow cowboy. These attacks affected the booming Texas economy. By the end of the 1860s, the Comanches had driven much of the livestock businesses out of West Texas. However over the years, Comanches would surrender or sell their lands to Texas cattlemen.Tippeconnic, Eric. God Dogs and Education: Comanche Traditional Cultural Innovation and Three Generations of Tippeconnic Men. University of New Mexico - Main Campus. November 11, 2016. =Battle of Antelope Hills= On December 19, 1868 a large Comanche and Kiowa band faced a company of 10 Cavalry (maj. M.H. Kidd) on the way from Fort Arbuckle to Fort Cobb. On December 25, six companies of the 6 Cavalry and one company of 37 Infantry (maj. A.W. Evans), on the way from Fort Bascom (New Mexico) to the Antelope Hills, came on the Nokoni village (about 60 tipis) of Tʉhʉyakwahipʉ aka Kiyou (\\"Horseback\\") and Tahka (\\"Arrowpoint\\"), where Yamparika chief Howea (\\"Gap-in-the-Wood\\") was as a visitor; Kiyou, the peaceful civil chief, was not in the camp, and Tahka's blood was still boiling after the Washita massacre. Seeing the soldiers arriving, Tahka, the war chief, led the Comanche warriors in a charge, but he was killed and the village and the stoks went destroyed. Kiowa warriors led by Manyi-ten came to take part in the fight; only one soldier was killed. In December 1868, exhausted after lack of food and freezing weather, the Nokoni went to Fort Cobb and there surrendered. =The Warren wagon train= Henry Warren was contracted to haul supplies to forts in the west of Texas, including Fort Richardson, Fort Griffin, and Fort Concho. On May 18, 1871, travelling down the Jacksboro-Belknap road heading towards Salt Creek Crossing, the supplies wagon train encountered Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, but, less than an hour later, the teamsters spotted a rather large group of riders ahead. Hidden in a thicket of scrub in the Salt Creek Prairie, the Kiowa had observed, without attacking, the slow approach of General Sherman's inspection retinue.Carter, R.G., On the Border with Mackenzie, 1935, Washington D.C.: Enyon Printing Co. The previous night, Mamanti (\\"He Walking-above\\"), the powerful shaman rival of Tene-angopte's friend Napawat (\\"No Mocassins\\"), had prophesied that this small party would be followed by a larger one with more plunder for the taking. Three hours later the 10 mule-drawn wagons filled with army corn and fodder came to the spot: in front of the charging warriors, the corn train quickly shifted into a ring formation, and all the mules were put into the center of the ring, but the defenders were overwhelmed and the warriors destroyed the corn supplies, killing and mutilating seven of the wagoneer's bodies. The Kiowa warriors lost three of their own, but left with 40 mules heavily laden with supplies. Five white men managed to escape, one of which was Thomas Brazeale who reached Fort Richardson on foot, some 20 miles away. As soon as Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie learned of the incident, he informed Sherman. Sherman and Mackenzie searched for the warriors responsible for the raid. The ambush had been planned by a large band of Kiowa warriors under the leadership of Satanta, Ado-ete (\\"Big Tree\\"), Satank, and Mamanti (\\"He Walking-above\\"), and several other chiefs took part in it, as did Zepko-ete (\\"Big Bow\\"), Tsen- tainte (\\"White Horse\\"), Guatotente (\\"Eagle Heart\\"), Gui-guako (\\"Yellow Wolf\\"), Set-maunte (\\"Fast Bear\\"), and, perhaps, Guipago himself. =First Indian leaders tried in state court= Back to the agency, Satanta boasted his deed, citing as involved Satank and Ado-ete too, and General Sherman ordered their capture. In the end, notwithstanding the intervention of Guipago, with loaded rifles and guns and well ready to fight,Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, New York, 1970) they were arrested at Fort Sill, and Sherman ordered their trial, making them the first Native American Leaders to be tried for raids in a US court.Handbook of Texas Online – SATANTA Sherman ordered the three Kiowa chiefs taken to Jacksboro, Texas, to stand trial for murder. Satank attempted escape and was killed while traveling to Fort Richardson for trial: he began singing his death song, and managed to wrestle a rifle from one of his guards, and was shot to death before he could manage to fire. His body lay unburied in the road, with his people afraid to claim it, though Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie assured the family they could safely claim Satank's remains. When General Sherman decided to send the Kiowa war chiefs to Jacksboro for trial, he wanted an example made. What he did not want, and what happened, was that the trial became a circus. First, the two attorneys appointed to represent the two Kiowa actually represented them, instead of participating in the kind of civics lesson which the Army had wanted. Their trial strategy of arguing that the two Chiefs were simply fighting a war for their people's survival attracted worldwide attention, and galvanized opposition to the entire process. Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs also opted to oppose the entire process, and also argued that the two chiefs were not subject to civilian jurisdiction since their people were at war with the United States. Nor were the Indians apologetic. At his trail Satanta warned what might happen if he was hanged: \\" I am a great chief among my people. If you kill me, it will be like a spark on the prairie. It will make a big fire – a terrible fire!\\" Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, as was Big Tree; but Edmund Davis, the Governor of Texas, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment for both was changed to life imprisonment. Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. Thanks to the stubborn behaviour of Guipago, who forced the U.S. Government to agree seriously threatening a new bloody war, Satanta and Big Tree were freed after two years of imprisonment at the Huntsville State Penitentiary in Texas. =Attack on Mow-way's camp on McLellan Creek and battle of the North Fork of the Red River= In 1872 the so-called Quaker Peace Policy had partly failed. It had reduced battles between tribes and the US military greatly, but not entirely. Legally it was still law, so troops out of Fort Sill could not officially be deployed against the Comanche. However, some army officers were eager to attack the Comanche in the heart of the Comancheria, on the Staked Plains, and in July 1872, did so. A captured comanchero, Edwardo Ortiz, had told the army that the Comanches were on their winter hunting grounds along the Red River on the Staked Plains. Gen. Christopher C. Augur, commander of the Department of Texas sent a detachment from Fort Concho, Texas, under Capt. Napoleon Bonaparte McLaughlin on a two-month reconnaissance patrol in the spring of 1872. He returned to the fort, confirming that the main force of the Comanches were in camps on the Staked Plains. Ortiz further claimed that army columns could successfully maneuver in that country. General Augur then summoned Colonel Ranald Mackenzie to San Antonio where they held a strategy meeting. Out of this meeting, the army developed a campaign against the Comanche in their strongholds in the Staked Plains. On September 28, 1872, near McClellan Creek, in Gray County, Texas, United States, the 4th U.S. Cavalry under Colonel Ranald Mackenzie, attacked a village of Kotsoteka Comanche Indians under subchief Kai-Wotche, being not in the famed Kotsoteka chief Mow-way (\\"Shaking Hand\\"). The \\"battle\\" was really an unexpected storm on the village with the easy killing of 23 men, women, and children and the capture of 120 or 130 women and children and more than 1.000 horses, as the Army managed to catch the camp totally by surprise. Most of the village's inhabitants were captured, but the coming, from a nearby camp, of the Quahadi Comanche Indians warriors led by Parra-ocoom (\\"Bull Bear\\"), Kobay-oburra (\\"Wild Horse\\") and Quanah induced the soldiers to quickly retreat. The day after, September 29, the Kotsoteka and Quahadi warriors attacked the military encampment, getting back the horses but not their women and children, so the Comanche prisoners were kept under guard and were transferred to Fort Concho, where they were kept prisoner through the winter. Mackenzie used the captives as a bargaining tool to force the off-reservation Indians back to the reservation, and to force them to free white captives. Mackenzie's stratagem worked, for shortly after the battle Mow-way and Parra-ocoom moved their bands to the vicinity of the Wichita Agency. The Nokoni chief, Tʉhʉyakwahipʉ aka Kiyou (\\"Horseback\\"), who himself had family members among the Indian prisoners, took the initiative in persuading the Comanches to trade stolen livestock and white captives, including Clinton Smith, in exchange for their own women and children. This marked the first time the United States had successfully attacked the Comanches in the heart of the Comancheria, and showed that the Staked Plains were no longer a safe haven. Further, this battle emphasized if the army wished to force the wild Comanches onto reservations, the way to do it was destroy their villages and leave them unable to survive off reservation. Mackenzie's tactics were such a success that Sherman empowered him to use them further during the Red River War of 1874. His attack on the village at Palo Duro Canyon, and his destruction of the Comanche horse herd at Tule Canyon, both in 1874, mirrored this battle in their entirety. =Indian Victim= In August 1873 about 20 miles west of Double Mountain Fork Suryeor expedition Capt J.E. Elgin found the body of a scalped girl about 8-9 years of age hanging from a tree. He had the remains of the corpse buried.The Weekly Democratic Statesman August 28, 1873 page 2 Accessed Library of Congress August 20,2020 =The Red River War= In history books, the Red River War officially began on July 20, 1874. On that day, General Sherman telegraphed General Philip Sheridan to begin an offensive against the Kiowa and Comanches on the plains of West Texas and Oklahoma, and either kill them or drive them to reservations. The army essentially adopted Mackenzie's tactics of the 1872 campaign at North Fork in their entirety – attack the Comanche in their winter strongholds, and destroy their villages and ability to live independently off the reservation. During the summer of 1874, the United States, through the army, launched a campaign to remove the Comanche, Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, the Southern band of the Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indian tribes from the Southern Plains. This campaign was meant to enforce their removal to reservations in Indian Territory. The campaigns of 1874 were unlike any prior attempts by the Army to pacify this region of the frontier. The \\"Red River War\\", as it was called, led to the end of the culture and way of life for the Southern Plains tribes and brought an end to the Plains tribes, as a people. The campaign of the Red River War was fought during a time when buffalo hunters were hunting the great American Bison nearly to extinction. Both the Bison and the people who lived off it nearly became extinct at the same timeClose, George (2000).. \\"Texas Beyond History\\" September 7, 2007. There were perhaps 20 engagements between army units and the Plains Indians during the Red River War. The well-equipped and well- supplied army simply kept the Indians running, and in the end, they simply ran out of food, ammunition, and the ability to fight any longer. ledger drawing depicting a battle between Southern Plains Indians and the U.S. Army during the Red River War (Battle of Buffalo Wallow September 1874). =The Second Battle of Adobe Walls= The Second Battle of Adobe Walls came during the Red River War, as the Plains tribes realized, with increasing desperation, that the Buffalo Hunters were killing off their food supply, and the very means of survival for their people. A combined force of Comanche, Kiowa, Cheyenne, and other Plains tribes raised almost 700 warriors - led by Comanche chiefs Quanah, Isa-tai (\\"Coyote Shit\\"), Kobay-oburra (\\"Wild Horse\\") (Parra-ocoom, sick because of pneumonia, couldn't join the party), Mow-way, Pearua-akupakup (\\"Big Red Meat\\"), Tabananika (\\"Sound-of-the-Sunrise\\"), Isa-rosa (\\"White Wolf\\"), Isa-habit (\\"Wolf Lying-down\\"), Hitetetsi (\\"Little Crow\\"), Isa-nanica (\\"He Hearing-a-Wolf\\"), and Kiowa chiefs Guipago, Satanta and Tsen-tainte - and made an attempt to attack the Buffalo Hunters encamped at the old ruins at Adobe Walls. On June 27, 1874, the allied Indian force attacked the 28 hunters and one woman encamped at Adobe Walls. Had the defenders been asleep, as the attackers hoped, they would have been overrun at once, and all killed. Had the attackers followed Quanah Parker's plan to simply accept losses and rush the buildings, the defenders would again, have been overrun. But the defenders were awake, and their long-range buffalo guns rendered the attack useless. Billy Dixon made perhaps the most famous rifle shot in the old west when he killed an Indian sitting on a bluff a mile away from the buildings. At that point, with Quanah Parker wounded, the Indians gave up the attack. It was the last great attempt to defend the Plains by the Indians, and the difference in weapons was simply too great to overcome.Campbell, Edward (2005). . \\"Texas State Library: The Battle of Adobe Walls September 7, 2007. Parra-ocoom, head chief of the Quahadi Comanche as Peta Nocona's natural successor, the great warrior who enjoied fighting with his knife against the bears, was killed by pneumonia during the fighting days at Adobe Walls. =Attack on Pearua-akup- akup's camp near Anadarko= After Adobe Walls fight, several Yamparika (Isa- nanica, Hitetetsi aka Tuwikaa-tiesuat, Piyi-otoho, and, camping nearby, Tabananika and Isa-rosa), Kotsoteka (Mow-way, he too camping nearby), Nokoni (Pearua-akupakup) and Quahadi (Kobay-oburra, head chief after Parra-ocoom's death) bands went to Fort Sill agency for the census and the distribution of annuities, but only Isa-nanica was allowed to stay in Fort Sill reserve, and the other chiefs had to lead their people to the Wichita agency at Anadarko; following some killings by the Kiowa, capt. Gaines Lawson company (25th Infantry), sent to garrison Anadarko, was reached by Colonel John W. \\"Black Jack\\" Davidson, with four companies of 10th Cavalry, from Fort Sill. On August 22, near Anadarko, with the Kiowa laughing at the Comanche, a cavalry detachment was sent to Pearua-akup-akup's village (60 tents) to take not only rifles and guns but also bows and arrows, and, when the Nokoni warriors reacted, the soldiers fired on them. Guipago, Satanta, Manyi-ten, Pa-tadal (\\"Poor Buffalo\\") and Ado'ete came in with their Kiowa braves, and the remnant companies of 10th Cavalry came too, to face 200 or 300 Nokoni Comanche and Kiowa; during the night Davidson ordered Comanche tents and stock to be burnt. The following day, August 23, the fight went on, with four \\"blue jackets\\" and 14 warriors wounded (one of them killed), until Nokoni and Kiowa retreated, burning the prairie and killing some white men near Anadarko and along the Beaver Creek. Friendly Tosawi and Asa-havey led their Penateka to Fort Sill; Kiyou probably judged wiser to go, with his friendly Nokoni band, to the Wichita agency.William H. Leckie, The Buffalo Soldiers: A Narrative of the Negro Cavalry in the West (University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1967) Arlen L. Fowler, The Black Infantry in the West, 1869-1891 (University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1996) The \\"hostile\\" Yamparika and Nokoni, joined the Quahadi and Kotsoteka, camping at Chinaberry Trees, Palo Duro Canyon. =Release, recapture, and death of Satanta at Huntsville= Satanta, Kiowa chief As a result of Guipago's stubborn stance, Satanta was released in 1873 (and Ado'ete was released too) and was alleged to be soon back attacking buffalo hunters and was present at the raid on Adobe Walls: really the Kiowa People deny he was involved in that battle, other than being present; anyway, the buffalo hunters were abusive in the land granted to the Comanche and Kiowa by the treaty and the Great Father in Washington. He yielded up his war lance and other symbols of leadership to younger, more aggressive men. But his very presence at the Battle violated his parole, and the Government called for his arrest; he surrendered in October 1874, and was returned to the State penitentiary. Forced to work on the road, guards reported that Satanta would stare for hours at the traditional hunting grounds of his people, and seemed to wither away. In his book, the History of Texas, Clarance Wharton reports of Satanta in prison: ::After he was returned to the penitentiary in 1874, he saw no hope of escape. he was worked on a chain gang which helped to build the M.K. & T. Railway. He became sullen and broken in spirit, and would be seen for hours gazing through his prison bars toward the north, the hunting grounds of his people.\\" Satanta killed himself on October 11, 1878, by jumping from a high window of the prison hospital.Satanta Ado'ete was also rearrested, but unlike Satanta, he was not sent back to Huntsville. No one would swear they had seen him, as they had Satanta, on the battlefield. Both Satank and Satanta are buried at the Chief's Knoll at Fort Sill Oklahoma. =Mackenzie's Campaign against Quanah Parker= Colonel Ranald Mackenzie and the 4th Cavalry Regiment (United States) pursued Quanah Parker and his followers all through late 1874 into 1875. He led a 5-unit movement to converge on the Indian hideouts along the eastern edge of the Staked Plains. Mackenzie, in the most daring and decisive battle of the campaign, destroyed five Indian villages on September 28, 1874, in Palo Duro Canyon. His destruction of the Indians' horses, 1000 of them in Tule Canyon, destroyed the Indians' resistance by taking the last of their prized possessions, their horses, along with destroying their homes and food supplies. On November 5, 1874, Mackenzie's forces won a minor engagement, his last, with the Comanches. In March 1875 Mackenzie assumed command at Fort Sill and control over the Comanche-Kiowa and Cheyenne-Arapaho reservations. =Surrender of Quanah Parker and end of the Texas Indian Wars= Quanah Parker, the last major chief of the Comanche Indians Mackenzie sent Jacob J. Sturm, a physician and post interpreter, to negotiate the Quahada's surrender. Sturm found Quanah, whom he called \\"a young man of much influence with his people\\", and made his case for yielding peacefully. Mackenzie had sent his personal word if Quanah surrendered, all his band would be treated honorably, and none charged with any offense. (The arrest and trial of Kiowa leaders in 1871 had made that a real possibility.) Contrariwise, Sturm carried Mackenzie's personal vow to hunt down every man, woman, and child who refused to yield. Quanah later said he was ready to die, but was loath to condemn the women and children to death. Quanah believed Colonel Mackenzie when he promised that if the Quahada did not surrender, every man, woman, and child would be hunted down and killed. Quanah rode to a mesa, where he saw a wolf come toward him, howl and trot away to the northeast. Overhead, an eagle \\"glided lazily and then whipped his wings in the direction of Fort Sill\\", as Jacob Sturm reported later. This was a sign, Quanah thought, and on June 2, 1875, he led his band to Fort Sill in present-day Oklahoma, and surrendered. On that day, the Plains Indians were extinct as a separate people, their way of life completely destroyed. =The White Man's revenge: deportation to Fort Marion, Florida; death of Guipago at Fort Sill= Guipago, Kiowa chief After the Palo Duro campaign (1874) and the surrendering of the last hostile Comanche groups coming back from the Staked Plains, Old Kiyou was appointed as Comanche head chief, and was ordered to select the \\"worst\\" Comanche chiefs and warriors, to be indicted as responsible of the uprising and deported to Fort Marion, Florida, along with 27 Kiowa to be selected by Tene-angopte. Only nine Comanche men (one \\"Black Horse\\", but probably not Kobay-otoho third chief of the Quahadi band, and eight \\"outlawed\\" warriors), were sent to Fort Marion: all the principal Comanche leaders (Quanah, Mow-way, Tababanika, Isa-rosa, Hitetetsi aka Tuwikaa-tiesuat, Kobay-oburra) were made safe, but neither Parra-ocoom, dead on June 27–28, 1874, during the Adobe Walls fighting, nor Pearua-akup-akup, dead in the icehouse – temporarily used as a jail – of Fort Sill on January 1, 1875, could benefit with Kiyou diplomatic skill in saving the most important warring chiefs of his own people. On the contrary, Guipago, along with Manyi-ten, Tsen-tainte and Mamanti (but not Ado-ete and Zepko-ete), were selected by Tene-angopte and sent to Fort Marion with some lesser personalities. Sent back to Fort Sill in 1879, Guipago, the stubborn chief who had forced \\"Mr. Washington\\" and the Texas Governor to accept his terms, died because of marsh-fever in July 1879. =The new life of Chief Quanah= Quanah, who had led the last campaign of the Plains tribes against the U.S. Army, then went tirelessly to work to help his people adapt to the Anglo world which had crushed them; he himself became \\"Quanah Parker\\", trying to deal with the white men as a half white man could do. Appointed by his old enemy Colonel Mackenzie as sole chief of the Comanches, he worked hard to bring education and the ability to survive in the white man's world to his people. He attempted to keep his people's land together, and when that became politically impossible, he tried to get the best bargain for his people he could. Aftermath and analysis Many tribes in Texas, such as the Karankawan, Akokisa, Bidui and others, were extinguished due to conflicts with settlers. University of Oklahoma Press. In his book The Conquest Of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing In The Promised Land, 1820–1875, Gary Anderson says \\"the 'Texas Creed' was enshrined in the Texas Rangers\\". According to Anderson, the Rangers believed the Indians were at best subhumans who \\"had no right of soil\\" and savaged pure, noble, and innocent settlers. According to captives of the period as written by them such as The Boy Captives and Nine Years with the Indians, the Rangers were the only force feared by the Indians. Killing Indians became government policy when second Texas President Mirabeau B. Lamar prescribed \\"an exterminating war\\" of \\"total extinction\\". In the Texan's side, almost every family at that time admitted to losing someone in the Indian Wars. =Disease= Disease brought largely by Europeans caused a dramatic decline of the native population. Anthropologist John C. Ewers has identified no fewer than thirty major epidemics, consisting mainly of smallpox and cholera, which took place between the years 1528 and 1890, which he believes responsible for wiping out close to 95 percent of Texas Indians.Close, George (2000). . \\"Texas Handbook Online September 7, 2007. Over half of the Comanche population was wiped out in the epidemics of 1780–81 and 1816–17. Many historians believe their population went from over 20,000 to less than 8,000 in these two rounds of disease. Thus, while technology and warfare with Anglo- Texans may have completed the process, the foremost cause of the decline of the Plains Indians came from diseases brought by conflict. Colonists had long known they brought diseases. Germ theory was widely understood since the 1760s. =1821–1844= At the time of the Texas Revolution, there were 30,000 Anglo nomadic colonists and Mexican mestizos in Texas, and approximately 20,000 Comanches alone, plus thousands each of Cherokee, Shawnee, Coushatta, and a dozen other tribes. Colonists were armed with single-shot weapons, which the Comanche, in particular, had learned very well to counter. Certainly the Spanish, then the Mexicans, and later the Texans had learned that single-shot weapons were not enough to defeat the deadly Comanche light horse, whose mastery of cavalry tactics and mounted bowmanship were renowned. The Comanches' constant movement caused many of their opponents' older single-shot weapons to miss their targets in the chaos of battle. The Comanche could then easily kill their enemies before they had a chance to reload. And though it was understated, the Comanche learned to use single-shot firearms quite well, though they found bows superior in terms of fire rate. The Comanche put an end to Spanish expansion in North America. They did what no other indigenous peoples had managed, defending their homeland – even expanding their homelands, in the face of the best military forces the Spanish could bring against them. In the late 18th century, the Comanche were said to have stolen every horse in New Mexico. Up until the introduction of repeating rifles and revolvers, weapons and tactics were definitely on the side of the Plains Indians, most especially the Comanche. It was not until the Battle of Bandera Pass, where revolvers were used for the first time against the Comanche, that the Texans began to gain a clear military advantage due to superior weaponry. Despite that disadvantage, it was disease and pure numbers which probably ended the Plains tribes. =1844–1875= By 1860, there were fewer than 8,000 Indians, and 600,000 Non-Indian colonists in Texas. The Texans further had access to repeating rifles and revolvers. Many military historians believe the defining moment in the Texas–Indian Wars came with the introduction of the revolver. In any event, pure numbers, better weapons, and brutal starvation tactics ended Plains Indians hold on to their homeland.

The line includes engine oils, gear oils and coolants. The oil carries both the American Petroleum Institute (API) diesel \\"C\\" rating as well as the API gasoline engine \\"S\\" rating. Ratings differ based on the oil. Rotella oils like T3 15w-40 meets both the API CJ-4 and SM specifications, and may be used in both gasoline and diesel engines. However, it is formulated specifically for vehicles without catalytic converters, containing phosphorus levels beyond the 600-800ppm range.http://www.pqiamerica.com/May%202013/rotella.htm Therefore, Rotella is not recommended for gasoline vehicles with catalytic converters due to the higher risk of damaging these emission controls.http://i.imgur.com/SwGI23M.png commercial link? Newer formulations of Rotella T6 however are API SM rated as safe for pre-2011 gasoline vehicles. Product lineup The Rotella product family is categorized by Shell into the following product families: * Engine oils * Coolants * Tractor fluid (a universal transmission, gear, hydraulic, and wet brake fluid) * Gear oil In the engine oil family, there are four basic oil sub-families: * Multigrade conventional oil—in SAE 10W-30 and 15W-40 viscosity ranges * Multigrade synthetic oil—in SAE 5W-40 and 15w-40 viscosity rangeshttps://rotella.shell.com/en_us/products/full-synthetic-and-blend- oil/t6-full-synthetic.html * Single grade conventional oil—in SAE 20, 30, 40 and 50 * Synthetic blend oil Shell is marketing their new CJ-4/SM oil as \\"Triple Protection,\\" meaning it provides enhanced qualities for engine wear, soot control and engine cleanliness. Shell's Rotella website indicates that on-road testing confirms the new Triple Protection technology produces better anti-wear characteristics than their existing CI-4+ rated Rotella oil. This is achieved despite a lower zinc and phosphorus additive level as called for by the API CJ-4 specification. (The 15W-40 Rotella T with Triple Protection oil has approximately 1200 ppm of zinc and 1100 ppm phosphorus at the time of manufacture.) The Shell Rimula brand is multi-national and comparable in all aspects, including the classification names. (i.e. T-5, T-6, Etc.) Competitors Rotella competes with similar lubrication products from other oil manufacturers. Some notable competitive products are: *ConocoPhillips 76 Lubricants Guardol ECT w/ Liquid Titanium *Mobil Delvac * Chevron Delo * Petro-Canada Duron * CITGO Citgard * Petrol Ofisi Maximus * Royal Purple * Valvoline Premium Blue * Castrol Tection Motorcycle usage Though marketed as an engine oil for diesel trucks, Rotella oil has found popularity with motorcyclists as well. The lack of \\"friction modifiers\\" in Rotella means they do not interfere with wet clutch operations. This is called a \\"shared sump\\" design, which is unlike automobiles which maintain separate oil reservoirs - one for the engine and one for the transmission. Used oil analysis (UOA) reports on BobIsTheOilGuy.com have shown wear metals levels comparable to oils marketed as motorcycle-specific. =JASO-MA= Both Rotella T 15W-40 conventional and, Rotella T6 5W-40 and 15w-40 Synthetic both list the JASO MA/MA 2 standard; this information can be found on the bottle adjacent to the SAE/API rating stamp. JASO is an acronym that stands for \\"The Japanese Automotive Standards Organization.\\" Note that the 10W-30 conventional oil does not list JASO-MA. Use in turbocharged cars Likewise with motorcycles, though marketed as an engine oil for diesel trucks, Rotella T6 5w-40 synthetic oil has also found popularity with drivers and tuners of gasoline powered vehicles that utilize turbocharging or other forms of forced induction. Several owners of high performance model cars have adopted its use due to its high heat tolerance and its resistance to shearing. Rotella T6 is a Non Energy Conserving Oil, and does not meet GF-5 Oil specifications. When Rotella T6 was revised for the API specification (for use in spark ignition engines), its Zinc levels were effectively reduced. Higher(content) Zinc Additives(ZDDP) are required for flat tappet engines and cartridge bearings, which In previous formulations Rotella T6 had desirable levels of Zinc(ZDDP).

History =WMAZ-FM and WAYS= The WDEN-FM license traces its history back to 1947, when WMAZ-FM signed on at 99.1 as Macon's first FM station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 124 It was owned by the Southeastern Broadcasting Company, which also owned AM 940 WMAZ (now WMAC). WMAZ-FM mostly simulcast its AM sister station for its first couple of decades; in 1953, the Southeastern Broadcasting Company added Macon's first VHF TV station, channel 13 WMAZ-TV.Telecasting Yearbook 1954-1955 page 100 In the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to TV, WMAZ-AM-FM switched to a full service middle of the road format of popular adult music, news and sports. In the late 1950s, WMAZ-AM-FM-TV produced middle Georgia's first radio-television simulcast for the 24th Annual Bibb County Spelling Bee. Southeastern sold WMAZ-AM-FM-TV to Southern Broadcasting Corporation in 1963, which merged with the News-Piedmont Company to form Multimedia, Inc. in 1967. Also in the late 1960s, WMAZ-FM broke its simulcast with AM 940; it began running an automated Top 40 format. In 1974, WMAZ-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Gray Highway in Macon. To establish a separate identity, WMAZ-FM changed its call letters to WAYS in 1984, maintaining its Top 40 sound. Multimedia merged with Gannett in 1995. Gannett had by this time decided to pull out of radio, concentrating on its TV stations and newspapers. It sold off WMAZ and WAYS in 1996 to Ocmulgee Broadcasting Company for $1.5 million. The next year, U.S. Broadcasting Limited Partnership, the owner of WDEN-AM-FM, bought WMWR (the renamed WMAZ) and WAYS from Ocmulgee in a $4.7 million transaction; by this time, WAYS was an oldies station. In the early 1990s, WAYS flipped to oldies. =Moving WDEN-FM to 99.1= In 2000, as part of an agreement to create a new move-in radio station in Atlanta, U.S. Broadcasting applied to downgrade WDEN-FM 105.3 from 100,000 watts to 6,100 and relocate it to 105.5 MHz. In order to preserve the country format's regional coverage, it was decided to move WDEN-FM to the 99.1 facility. For the month of December 2000, WDEN-FM was simulcast on 105.3 and 99.1, with messages asking listeners to tune to 99.1 for WDEN-FM's country format. The day after Christmas, WDEN-FM moved exclusively to 99.1; WAYS and its oldies format changed positions to the newly moved 105.5 MHz.

To the north the former municipality of Reinberg borders on the Strelasund From the village of Stahlbrode that used to belong to it, there is a car ferry to the island of Rügen (Zudar peninsula).  History  In 1220 construction began on the church and in 1325 Reinberg was mentioned for the first time in the records. On the dissolution of the Principality of Rügen in 1325, the village transferred to the Duchy of Pomerania. From the end of the Thirty Years' War to the year 1815 the region belonged to Swedish Pomerania and thereafter to the Prussian Province of Pomerania. Until 1952 Reinberg was part of the district of Grimmen within the Bezirk of Rostock to 1994. Since 1990 it has also bee part of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. On 7 June 2009 the hitherto independent parish of Reinsberg merged with those of Behnkendorf, Brandshagen, Horst, Kirchdorf, Miltzow and Wilmshagen to form the new municipality of Sundhagen.StBA: Änderungen bei den Gemeinden Deutschlands, siehe 2009, 2.

Sights  Amongst the sights of Reinberg are its Gothic village church, the Sühnestein monument on the cemetery wall that dates to the 15th century and the Reinberg Lime, which was the largest tree in Germany in the 19th century. The age of the tree is around 1,000 years. It is possible that the lime had been planted before the foundation and consecration of the church. Near the tree is the grave of the father of surgeons, Theodor Billroth. The Sühnestein (\\"Atonement Stone\\") has a kneeling figure with hands clasped, next to Christ on the cross. Above the cross, between two roses, are the initials \\"J.N.R.J.\\" and the words: \\"domini miserere mei\\".

Originally published anonymously, it was his first book, and along with Le Mariage de Loti (1880, also published anonymously), would introduce the author to the French public and quickly propel him to fame; his anonymous persona did not last long. Aziyadé is semi-autobiographical, based on a diary Loti kept during a three-month period as a French Naval officer in Greece and Constantinople (now Istanbul) in the fall and winter of 1876. It tells the story of the 27-year-old Loti's illicit love affair with an 18-year- old \\"Circassian\\" harem girl named Aziyadé. Although Aziyadé was one of many conquests in the exotic romantic's life, she was his greatest love, he would wear a gold ring with her name on it for the rest of his life. Forming a love triangle, the book also describes Loti's \\"friendship\\" with a Spanish man servant named Samuel, for which most critics believe, based on Loti's diary entries, that some sort of homosexual affair occurred (indeed some believe Aziyadé never existed and the entire work is a cover for a homosexual love story, however the evidence for Aziyadé's existence seems overwhelming, (See Blanch)). It also describes Loti's love affair with Turkish culture which became a central part of his \\"exotica\\" persona. The only known English translation is by Marjorie Laurie which can be found in many editions, no longer in copyright, however some of the parts have been sanitized regarding harem life, prostitution and homosexuality.

History For centuries, Wieck belonged to the Duchy of Pomerania and became Swedish after the Thirty Years' War. After Napoleon, Wieck became in 1815 Pomeranian again. After World War II, it was part of the district of Ribnitz-Damgarten. Wieck now belongs to the federal state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

The documentary Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price was released on the same day as Why Wal-Mart Works. Director Ron Galloway was quoted as saying, \\"I started making my film with no agenda, with no set outcome in mind.

Councillors who stood down at the 2000 election, included independent Joan Ibbotson of Aire Valley ward, who had represented the ward for 12 years, having been a Liberal Democrat until she left the party in 1999. Conservative councillor for Upper Wharfedale for the past four years, Ken Luty also did not contest the 2000 election. The Labour party did not put up any candidates for the election in 2000, while Ingleborough councillor David Ireton contested the election as an independent after having previously been a Conservative councillor. Election result The Conservatives remained with 18 seats after the elections, while the number of independents increased by one to 12 and the Liberal Democrats dropped one to 4. Turnout at the election ranged from a high of 54.3% in Bolton Abbey ward to a low of 20.3% in Skipton East ward. Conservative Christopher Knowles- Fitton gained Bolton Abbey from independent Robert Heseltine, while the Conservatives also picked up the Aire Valley seat previously held by independent Joan Ibbotson before she stood down at the election. However independent John Alderson gained Cowling from Conservative Janet Ackroyd by one vote and David Ireton held Ingelborough as an independent after leaving the Conservatives with a majority of 653 votes over the Conservative candidate. Meanwhile, independent Frances Burrows gained Skipton East from the Liberal Democrats, but the Liberal Democrats did hold seats in Bentham and Settle wards.

He played for Richmond, Bath, Cardiff Blues, Bristol and has also represented England at many levels. Professional career Crompton began his professional career with Bath in 1993, before moving to Bristol in 1999 after a spell at Richmond. He played for Bristol for four years, making up his first stint at the club, before moving to the Cardiff Blues for the 2003-04 Celtic League. He returned for his second spell at Bristol on a two-year contract along with another former Bristol and Bath player, Dave Hilton, helping them win the National Division One title in 2005. Newly promoted to the Premiership, they were joined in the front row at the start of the 2005-06 Guinness Premiership by yet another former Bristol and Bath man, Mark Regan. With Hilton playing loosehead, Regan at hooker, and Crompton at tighthead, their combined age was over 100. Because of this, no one expected the old but experienced front row team to have as much impact as they did, and they became known as 'Dad's Army'. Having helped keep Bristol in the Premiership in their first season, and after playing every game during the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership, which saw the team finish a surprising 3rd, he renewed his contract with Bristol Rugby in Spring 2006. International career He has played for England U16s', captained the U18's and the U21s, leading the U18 team in all five of their matches in 1991. He was selected for the England A tour of Australia and Fiji in 1995 debuting against South Australia. In 1998 he went on his first full England tour to the Southern Hemisphere, but returned home uncapped. He made no further appearance for England until 2007 when he was selected for the mid-year test series in South Africa. Many spaces were made available on this tour as no Bath, Leicester Tigers or Wasps were selected by Brian Ashton due to Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup Final commitments. This meant that Crompton was selected for the tour at the age of 34, nine years after his first senior England tour, as a result of his form in the Premiership. Thus he was able to win his full England cap, when he took to the field during the first test against the Springboks in Bloemfontein as a replacement for Stuart Turner on 26 May 2007. Having already represented his country, Crompton was called up again to wear the rose this time for England Sevens, however he rejected the offer as he believed that sevens do not take scrums seriously. Crompton is now running a successful building company DC builders amongst other things related to his one true love rugby he is also working very closely with his good friend and mentor Daniel Jenkins.

It is owned by Cumulus Media and airs a news/talk format. The studios and offices are on Mulberry Street in Macon. It is one of the oldest radio stations in Georgia. WMAC is a primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System (EAS). WMAC is a Class B radio station, powered at 50,000 watts by day with a non-directional signal. It can be heard from Albany to the suburbs of Atlanta. But because it broadcasts on AM 940, a clear channel frequency reserved for XEW in Mexico City, WMAC reduces its power at night to 10,000 watts, and uses a directional five-tower array, concentrating the signal in Central Georgia. The transmitter is located on Forsyth Road (U.S. Route 41) in Macon.Radio-Locator.com/WMAC Programming Much of WMAC's schedule is made up of nationally syndicated conservative talk shows, most of them from the co-owned Westwood One Network. Weekdays begin with two information shows, America in the Morning and First Light, followed by Chris Plante, Mark Levin, Michael Savage and Red Eye Radio. From Premiere Networks, WMAC carries Rush Limbaugh in middays and Sean Hannity in late evenings. On weekends, WMAC carries tech expert Kim Komando and consumer advocate Clark Howard. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming. Most hours begin with world and national news from Fox News Radio. Local news and weather updates are provided by Channel 13 WMAZ-TV. History =Early Years= This station started out as part of a radio experiment by Mercer University professor C.R. Fountain's physics class in 1910. On October 30, 1922, Mercer obtained a commercial license under the call sign WMAZ. The university soon found itself in over its head operating a radio station. In 1927, it sold WMAZ to the Macon Junior Chamber of Commerce, forerunner of the Macon Jaycees. A group of Macon businessmen formed the Southeastern Broadcasting Company and leased the station in 1929 before buying it outright in 1935. In the 1930s, WMAZ was a daytimer, broadcast on 1180 kilocycles, first at 500 watts, and later at 1,000 watts, but required to sign off at sunset. In 1937, WMAZ became a CBS Radio Network affiliate, carrying its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" It broadcast the Soap Box Derby live. By the late 1930s, WMAZ was permitted to broadcast after sundown, but at reduced power to protect. In 1941, with the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), WMAZ moved to its current 940 kHz, a better spot on the dial.Broadcasting Yearbook 1943 page 86 The power was boosted to 5,000 watts, day and night, and by 1950 it increased to 10,000 watts around the clock. =FM and TV Stations= In 1947, Macon's first FM station signed on, 99.1 WMAZ-FM (now WDEN-FM).Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 124 WMAZ-FM mostly simulcast its AM sister station for its first couple of decades. In 1953, the Southeastern Broadcasting Company added Macon's first VHF TV station, Channel 13 WMAZ-TV.Telecasting Yearbook 1954-1955 page 100 Because 940 WMAZ was a CBS affiliate, WMAZ-TV also ran CBS TV shows, with a secondary affiliation with ABC and the DuMont Television Network. In the 1950s, as network programming moved from radio to TV, WMAZ-AM-FM switched to a full service middle of the road format of popular adult music, news and sports. In the late 1950s, WMAZ-AM-FM-TV produced middle Georgia's first radio-television simulcast for the 24th Annual Bibb County Spelling Bee. In 1958, 940 WMAZ's daytime power was boosted to 50,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-141 That made it the second-most powerful station in Georgia, after WSB 750 in Atlanta, powered at 50,000 watts around the clock. In the 1960 edition of Broadcasting Yearbook, an advertisement said 50,000 watt WMAZ is \\"the only station to cover completely the rich, 31-county Middle Georgia market.\\" =Ownership Changes= Southeastern sold WMAZ-AM-FM-TV to Southern Broadcasting Corporation in 1963, which merged with the News-Piedmont Company to form Multimedia, Inc. in 1967. In 1974, WMAZ-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Gray Highway in Macon. Multimedia merged with Gannett in 1995. Gannett had by this time decided to pull out of radio, concentrating on its TV stations and newspapers. It sold off the radio stations in 1996. The new owners changed AM 940's call letters to WMWR (standing for Macon-Warner Robins), but a year later, the station was sold as part of a group purchase by U.S. Broadcasting. In 1998, the station changed to its current call sign, WMAC. The call sign not only stands for MACon, but are a nod to the heritage call letters the station used for three-quarters of a century. In 2002, U.S. Broadcasting sold this station as part of a group purchase by Cumulus Media. In 2015, WMAC switched To Westwood One News from ABC News Radio due to a corporate change by Cumulus Media. In August of 2020, Westwood One News shut down; so WMAC aligned with Fox News Radio for National News. As the news department was scaled back due to budget cuts, news and weather updates began to be supplied by former sister station WMAZ-TV Channel 13.

Description Juvenile N. pallida: note the black throat band, in contrast to adult coloration This medium-sized cobra attains lengths between , but may grow to a maximum length of around in very rare cases. It is often thought of as an attractive species; it is usually bright salmon-red contrasted with a broad black throat band and subocular teardrop markings. However, the color of this species does have variation, which usually depends on where in Africa a particular specimen is found. For example, specimens from southern Kenya and northern Tanzania have an orange-red colour, with a broad, dark blue or black throat band. Some specimens may have two or three throat bands, but this is uncommon for specimens from East Africa. The ventral side is also reddish in colour, sometimes the throat area may be a creamy white. Specimens from other areas can be yellow, pinkish, pink-grey, pale red or steel grey. Most specimens will have a throat band, but it will fade or even sometimes disappear in larger adults. The true red specimens will become reddish-brown in colour as they age and grow in size. The body of this snake is slightly depressed, tapered and moderately slender with a medium-length tail. It is slightly compressed dorsoventrally and subcylindrical posteriorly. The head is broad, flattened and slightly distinct from the neck. The canthus is distinct and the snout is rounded. The eyes are medium to large in size with round pupils. Dorsal scales are smooth and strongly oblique. =Scalation= Dorsal scales on the midbody are in 21–27, ventrals are in 197–228, and subcaudals are in 61–72 rows, subscales are paired, and the anal scale is single. There are seven upper labials, one upper labial enters the eye; two preoculars, three postoculars, and the lower labials are usually eight in number (range 7-9). Distribution and habitat The red spitting cobra is mainly found in East Africa, including Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia, southern Egypt, northern and eastern Ethiopia, and northern Tanzania and northern Sudan. It is also widespread in the dry country of eastern and northern Kenya. It primarily inhabits dry savanna and semidesert areas of East Africa up to an elevation of about above sea level. They can usually be found near water holes. Behavior Red spitting cobras are terrestrial, fast and alert snakes. Adult specimens of this species are nocturnal, while juveniles are more active during the day. Adults like to hide in termite mounds, old logs, holes, brush piles or any other ground cover during the day. They are also known to be cannibalistic; this could be the reason juveniles and smaller specimens are diurnal, while adults are nocturnal. When threatened, this cobra rears up and displays a typical cobra hood. It may also hiss loudly. If the intruder does not retreat, it may spray jets of venom to the face of the intruder. Venom in the eyes can cause burning pain and blindness. Even so, this snake seldom causes fatalities in humans. Diet This species has a wide range of prey, but they prefer amphibians such as toads and frogs, if and when they are available. However, they will prey on rodents, birds and probably other snakes. They are known to raid chickens in the region. Reproduction The red spitting cobra is oviparous. The female will lay 6 to 21 eggs. Venom The venom of this species, like most spitting cobras, contains a mixture of neurotoxins and cytotoxins. Bite symptoms include slight pain around the wound and numbness of the lips, fingers and tongue. Although it rarely causes human fatalities, survivors are usually disfigured. The murine IP value for this snake is 2 mg/kg. In September 2011, a snake keeper from the Eastern Cape in South Africa died shortly after a red spitting cobra sprayed venom into his face while he and a friend were photographing the snake. Some of the venom was believed to have entered his nasal passages and led to anaphylactic shock. His asthma is believed to have contributed to the fatal reaction. An autopsy done on him by the eastern cape provincial pathologist revealed no piting or damage either in his nasal cavities, throat or lungs. Taxonomy This species was formerly considered to be a subspecies of Naja mossambica, N. m. pallida, but is now categorized as a separate species. Indeed, N. mossambica is more closely related to N. nigricollis than to this species.

Part of the Second World War he and his family were imprisoned in Japanese prison camps. In secondary school he was introduced to science by Free Van Heek, Professor of empirical sociology at the Leiden University, who motivated him to use his own library and write a paper, his first, on action and action research.Martha Vahl, Gerard de Zeeuw: models, systems, support and research: A bio-memo, paper 2002. De Zeeuw studied at the Leiden University from 1955 to 1962, obtaining degrees in Mathematics, Statistics and Econometrics. In 1961–1962 he continued his studies at the Erasmus University under Jan Tinbergen, obtaining a degree in Econometrics. At the Stanford University in 1963–1964 he studied mathematical psychology under Patrick Suppes en Bob Estes and finished his PhD exam. Back in the Netherlands at the University of Amsterdam in 1973 he received his Ph.D. with the thesis titled Model thinking in psychology. = University of Amsterdam = De Zeeuw served most of his academic career at the University of Amsterdam, where he had started in 1964 and retired in 2006. In 1971 he was Senior Researcher at the Psychological Laboratory of the University of Amsterdam, and in 1974 he was appointed full professor in Research methodology, specifically in the fields of adult education, social work and social helping, community development and social theory. In 1993 he became Professor of Mathematical modelling of complex social systems. At the University of Amsterdam he has been dean of the Faculty of Andragogy, Chair of the department of research methodology in the Faculty of Psychology, and Board member of the university. Since 1994 he has been visiting professor at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in the area of systems and management, and at the London School of Economics in the field of social and organizational psychology. De Zeeuw also lectured at the Agricultural University of Wageningen for three years. He was elected twice as Fellow of the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS) in Wassenaar, the Netherlands.G. de Zeeuw , Netherlands Institute of Advanced Study, 2007. Since 2006 he is Senior Professor of Architectural Design Research at the University of Leuven at the Sint Lucas School of Architecture. Among his former students are Debiprasad Dash and Hector Ponce, editors of the Journal of Research Practice, and John McManus Professor and Chair of Leadership and Development at York St John University. = Other scientific work = In 1970 Albert Hanken and De Zeeuw co-founded the Dutch Systems Group with De Zeeuw as its first president. The Dutch Systems Group, the Society for General Systems Research and others in 1980 founded the International Federation for Systems Research with George Klir as their first president until 1986, and Gerard de Zeeuw as third president from 1992 to 1994. He was a significant contributor to cyberneticsGlanville, R. (2002), Introduction. Syst.

He is extraordinary member of the Dutch Institute of Psychologists, for his efforts to promote the study of psychology, and honorary member of the United Kingdom Systems Society. He organized more than 100 conferences, in different disciplines.Gerard de Zeeuw , biography 2007. De Zeeuw served on the Editorial Boards of the journals of Statistica Neerlandica and Systemica, and was editor-in-chief of the latter. In the 1990s he became associate editor of the Systems Research and Behavioral Science and of the Journal of Research Practice in 2005.  Work  = \\"Problems of increasing competence\\", 1985 = The concept of competence is a requiring theme in De Zeeuws work. In his first 1985 paper about this, titled \\"Problems of increasing competence\\", De Zeeuw focussed on the growing complexity of society, and the problems around individual competence and social competence. He introduced the problem as follows: > Societies maintain many systems that help order individuals' activities. > Some are technical, some economical, etc. Systems designed to remove or > prevent social ills form a special class. They restrict or enhance certain > types of collective competence: To help solve, variedly and flexibly, > individuals' problems. Finding ways for systematic enhancement turns out to > be difficult...De Zeeuw (1985, p. 11) In his 1985 paper De Zeeuw proposed a \\"the concept of a support system\\" as: > ... a research tool to strengthen such collective competence. The concept > focuses on the users of systems. How can they achieve or increase specific > forms of collective competence—either by themselves, or helped by research? In 1986 De Zeeuw further explained about the role of science to increase competence. To do so, he explained: > ... it must reflect on its own procedures, and must design research methods > that are suited to the problems of increasing competence, also via the > implementation of new social systems. This turns out not to be easy. > Procedures which for example lead to the possibility of prediction are not > useful for increasing collective competence.Gerard de Zeeuw, \\"Social change > and the design of enquiry\\", in Felix Geyer and Johannes van der Zouwen, > eds., Sociocybernetic paradoxes p. 143 In response Francis Heylighen (1988) described that \\"a general theory of the dynamics and stabilization of distinctions based on the closure concept could help us to solve our own complex problems. Practically such an application could be implemented as a computer-based support system... which would help actors to structure their problems, ideas and information, by recombination and closure of simple components.\\"Heylighen, Francis. \\"Building a science of complexity\\". 1988 Annual Conference of the Cybernetic Society. London. 1988. Furthermore, Jan Kooistra (1988) stipulated the problem of \\"the absence of a terminology\\". He noted: > The absence of a terminology is not a problem of the absence of truth for > things that cannot be named, but the problem of the incompatibility in > principle between, on the one hand, the need to order and, on the other, the > result of an ordering, as this incompatibility is expressed in the procedure > of particular inclusion and exclusion.Kooistra, J. Denken is bedacht. > Culemborg, Giordano Bruno, 1988 In 2002 Kooistra added, that \\"this quote represents the dilemma De Zeeuw was – and still is – trying to by-pass during his scientific life. How to judge the quality of reasoning in the social sciences whereas you are part of the same system?\\"Kooistra, Jan. \\"Flowing\\". Systems research and behavioral science 19.2 (2002): 123. = Theory of communication systems = Following the reflexive turn of the mathematical theory of communication of Claude Shannon, signals could be considered as messages with expected information value, with applications also to social science theory.Loet Leydesdorff (2002). \\"The Communication Turn in the Theory of Social Systems\\". In: \\"Systems Research and Behavioural Science\\" 19:pp. 129-136. A linguistic turn was added by the Cybernetics work of [Niklas Luhmann , Gordon Pask and De Zeeuw in relation to the uncertainty and meaning of a social message. Luhmann considered language as the as the operator of social systems and operating system of society while Pask emphasised language's reflexive function in the social system.Op. cit. Gerard de Zeeuw elaborated this paradigm by emphasizing \\"languages\\" and \\"reports\\" rather than for \\"laws\\" and \\"facts\\" in a social science design. De Zeeuw submited that language is the evolutionary achievement which enables us to communicate using two channels for the communication at the same time: a statement can be provided with a meaning and it is expected to contain information.Gerard de Zeeuw (1997). \\"Second Order Organizational Research\\".

Initially training in judo and jujutsu, he soon took an interest in karate, starting his study of the art in 1959. In 1966, Sherry became the first person to pass a grading in the UK for a black belt in Shotokan karate,Two other individuals from the United Kingdom had already been awarded their blackbelts by the Japan Karate Association before 1966: Charles Mack was graded 1st Dan Shotokan by Masatoshi Nakayama on 4 March 1962 in Japan; and Vernon Bell was ratified as a JKA blackbelt on 5 February 1964, having corresponded with the JKA in Tokyo and relinquished his Yoseikan grade. having trained with JKA instructor Keinosuke Enoeda. He graded alongside his Red Triangle clubmate Joseph Chialton on 10 February 1966, with Jack Green earning his blackbelt later that year.UK Karate history Sherry, alongside Jack Green and Eddie Whitcher were also the first to be graded 2nd Dan in the United Kingdom, gaining their grade in 1967 at Crystal Palace. In 1966, Sherry won the first British all-styles championship, beating competitors from all of Britain's karate styles. He went on, in 1968, to become European champion in kumite, an achievement he repeated in a number of subsequent years. Andy dominated the early KUGB karate championships, winning the kata competition for the first four years running (1967–1970) and the kumite in 1968 and 1970. On the competition circuit, Andy Sherry was well known for using a yori-ashi gyaku- tsuki (lunging rear-hand punch) as his \\"trademark\\" manoeuvre, leading many competitors of the time to joke that he only knew one technique. Retiring from competition in 1977, Sherry continues to coach the KUGB international competition squad to this day, and now runs his own karate club, the Liverpool Red Triangle. Sherry earned 9th dan (9th level black belt) making him Britain's highest ranking Shotokan karate practitioner in February 2013.

The Marques was built in Valencia, Spain, in 1917, as a polacca-rigged brig. She was used to carry fruit from the Canary Islands to northern Europe. Damaged during World War II, she was repaired in 1947 and subsequently used in the Mediterranean. She was badly maintained and by 1971 she was in poor condition. In 1971 Englishman Robin Cecil-Wright bought the Marques and had her extensively repaired and re-rigged in Southampton, England. She saw use in films, most notably Dracula, and in television shows such as The Onedin Line and Poldark. In 1977 Mark Litchfield bought a one-half share in the ship. She was again re-rigged, this time as a barque, largely for her part in the BBC series The Voyage of Charles Darwin as his ship . At this time she was renamed the Bark Marques.  Last voyage  In 1983 the Marques sailed from Plymouth, England, to Antigua in the Caribbean for use in charter tours during the northern winter. In the summer of 1984 she sailed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to compete in the Cutty Sark Tall Ships' Races. The Marques won the first tall ships' race, from Puerto Rico to Bermuda. The ship left Hamilton on the second race, bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 2 June 1984. On the night of 2 June the ship ran into a gale. In the early hours of 3 June she was hit by a sudden squall and a large wave, possibly a rogue wave, and was knocked down onto her starboard side. Although the ship had been converted to a sail training and charter cruise ship, she had retained the main cargo hatch from her days as a commercial vessel. When she was knocked down the main hatch was breached and water flooded into the interior of the ship. She sank in less than a minute, with the loss of 19 of her 28 crew members. Based on documentation of the ship, tallship sailor Daniel Parrott suggested that insufficient stability (resistance of a ship to capsizing) could have added to or caused the knock-down. The rigging of the Marques had been changed and the sail surface likely increased over the years, which naturally led to decreased (but not necessarily dangerous) stability. The last owner had repeatedly avoided a routine safety check of the ship that had been requested by British authorities; as the outcome of such a check remains unknown, it is unclear if the ship's stability was problematic and, if so, if the check would have detected it.Parrott, Daniel.

It is one of Poland's most notable churches with a Neoclassical facade. The church ranks among Warsaw's oldest buildings. Over time, it has seen many reconstructions, resulting in its present-day appearance, unchanged since 1788. Currently it is the main church parish of the academic community in Warsaw.  History  In 1454 Duchess of Masovia Anna FiodorownaJ. Tęgowski, Anna i Barbara – księżne mazowieckie z XV wieku. Przyczynek do genealogii Piastów mazowieckich, in: J. Śliwiński (red.), Społeczeństwo i polityka do XVII wieku, Olsztyn 1994 (in some old books mistakenly called Holszanska), coming from a Ruthenized Lithuanian princely house, founded this church with a cloister for the Franciscan friars (Order of Friars Minor). The square in front of the church was a place of solemn homages to Polish monarchs by the rulers of Prussia (the first one in 1578, the last one in 1621). In 1582 a slender tower was added to the church. Some time later it was encompassed with a rampart and incorporated into the city fortifications. patriotic demonstration in front of St. Anne's, February 27, 1861, which ended in much bloodshed. The St. Anne's Church was reconstructed several times in 1603, 1634, 1636 and in 1667 (it was heavily damaged during the siege of Warsaw and plundered by Swedish and German troops in the 1650s). Between 1740 and 1760 the façade was reconstructed in rococo style according to Jakub Fontana's design and decorated with two filigree belfries. The walls and semicircular vault ceilings of the church, divided into bays, were decorated at that time with profuse paintings in perspective, using illusionary techniques and depicting scenes in the life of Saint Anne. A chapel of Saint Ładysław was also decorated in this fashion. All paintings were by Friar Walenty Żebrowski. The church was reconstructed for the last time between 1786 and 1788 by order of King Stanisław August Poniatowski. During the Warsaw Uprising of 1794, part of the national Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, Bishop Józef Kossakowski, considered the traitor of the nation, was executed in front of the church (hanged with a great applause by Warsaw inhabitants). The roof of the church was heavily damaged in the air raid on Warsaw in 1939 and then destroyed by fire in 1944 during the Warsaw Uprising but soon repaired. In 1949 the walls were undermined by the excavation for the WZ route and had to be quickly reinforced. Restoration of all elements was undertaken from the 1940s-70s, supervised by architect . Façade and interior The present façade was built in 1788 in a Neoclassical style typical of the reign of King Stanisław August Poniatowski, by Chrystian Piotr Aigner. Sculptors of that time were Jakub Monaldi and Franciszek Pinck, who carved statues of the Four Evangelists which decorate the façade. The interior of the church is now in high-baroque style with several chapels. The church makes an overwhelming impression on the visitor with its surprisingly rich interior filled with frescoes. The only example of a diamond vault preserved in Warsaw can be seen in the cloister leading to the vestry.

He is the creator and host of the Adult Swim television show Hot Package, creator of the \\"TV Carnage\\" compilations, and helped found Vice TV. He hosts the Adult Swim show Mostly 4 Millennials. Early life Beckles spent the majority of his teenage years in Toronto punk bands including Black Jello, who were well known for being banned from all live venues in Toronto. He began experimenting with film making with two high school friends, which included the filming of him visiting white supremacists in their home. These early filming endeavors led to him studying film at Concordia University. Soon after, Beckles began working with and shaping what was then a ten-page weekly called The Voice of Montreal, which grew into Vice. Beckles became a familiar face on Canadian TV while occasionally performing stand-up in Toronto and New York. He produced and directed a hit festival documentary called Strip Club DJs and was a reporter on The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos. TV Carnage Beckles recognized the appeal of poor programming in 1994 when he began releasing VHS mashups of spray-on hair infomercials, squirrel cooking shows, and public access freaks performing like no one’s watching. These compilations led to the creation of TV Carnage, a bootleg home-video series in which Beckles distills all the strangest clips from late-night informercials, local-access programs, and found videos into hour-long DVDs. While Beckles had been editing together Tex Avery cartoons with The Stooges songs to entertain his friends while in high school, the TV Carnage format didn't evolve into its current form until 1996. While bedridden and doped up on painkillers, Beckles began to assemble mashups with themes. In these mashups, Beckles treats well-known and unknown footage alike, sewing the scenes and moments together to create an absurd alternate entertainment universe. A self-described, \\"slutty distributor of heavenly crap,\\" Beckles calls the creation of TV Carnage his \\"way of screaming at the world.\\" Though the compilations' original format was VHS, Beckles soon began producing DVDs. The format allowed for a wider audience and soon TV Carnage began to gain a cult following. It has been heralded by the likes of The New York Times, Vice, Wired', Spike Jonze, Tim and Eric, Brett Gelman, Mike Lazzo (Head of Adult Swim), Jonathan Krisel, Johnny Knoxville, Anne Heche, Crystal Castles, and Michael Cera. Cera has claimed, \\"TV Carnage is some of the most brilliant stuff out there right now.\\" While reviewing TV Carnage's Let's Work it Out, blog fourfour claimed that, \\"I'd argue that not only would this blog look different were it not for Beckles, but the Internet would in general – his diabolical scavenging defined an essential online sensibility.\\" In an interview with the blog Never Ending Radical Dude, Beckles explained his process for creating the TV Carnage compilations: \\"I would always kind of obsessively watch TV to look for the most interesting decisions people made while in front of a camera. In TV Carnage I try and make a weird story out of the clips that I put together. I’m a frustrated animator in a way. Every clip for me is like a frame ya know. So I started collecting all this stuff [clips] and decided to put it all together. I made smaller ones for friends early on maybe 10–15 minutes long, then I decided to make longer ones that were actually an hour or more than a hour.\\" TV Carnage DVDs include: * Ouch Television My Brain Hurts * A Rich Tradition of Magic * When Television Attacks * Casual Fridays * A Sore For Sighted Eyes * Let's Work It Out!

A big, craggy-faced man, he would usually be found playing gruff police inspectors or henchmen in adventure series and police dramas of the period. He was also notable as a supporting player in a number of classic British horror films. He would typically be found in television series such as Adam Adamant Lives!, The Avengers, Paul Temple, Police Surgeon, Public Eye, The Saint, Softly, Softly, Special Branch, The Third Man and Z-Cars. He also made appearances in many popular sitcoms of the period, such as Please Sir!, Dad's Army, The Galton and Simpson Playhouse, George and Mildred, The Likely Lads, Man About the House and That's My Boy. In films he often appeared in the horror genre, either as policemen or landlords for companies such as Hammer Studios, Amicus and AIP throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. His credits include The Curse of the Werewolf (1961), The Evil of Frankenstein (1963), The Gorgon (1964) and The Deadly Bees (1966). In 1969 he appeared in Gordon Hessler's The Oblong Box, in which he would have his only leading role opposite stars Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. In a part originally earmarked for Price, he played the disfigured Sir Edward Markham, acting underneath a red velvet hood until the film's climatic unmasking. Unfortunately his voice was deemed unsuitable and he was redubbed for the film's release, after which it was back to a supporting role in his next horror film, The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971).

Kirkus Reviews criticized that \\"the narrative...is rather overfull of details-a crazily built house, highly idiosyncratic family members, two boy interests, a beloved sick cat-which tend to compete for the reader's attention in much the same way as Mia's colors\\", and stated that this \\"flaw\\" is \\"not unusual with first novels\\". Kliatt criticized the plot, saying it isn't \\"half as interesting\\" as the \\"information on this rare condition\\". Kliatt also commented on Mia's \\"ups and downs\\", nothing that they are \\"fairly ordinary\\". VOYA pointed out that this book is \\"probably not one that teens will pick up without coaxing\\". The audiobook was criticized by School Library Journal, who states that \\"narrator Danielle Ferland moves from character to character effortlessly, but without much deviation in voice inflections for the secondary players\\". On the other hand, AudioFile praised the work, saying it \\"brings alive a unique young person and her rare gift\\". A Mango-Shaped Space has been praised by several authors, including Paula Danziger, Karen Cushman, Meg Cabot, and Judy Blume.

A big time player, over the years Tony has collected every honour in the game and is often touted as one of the greatest players to grace the British leagues. The 6ft5 small forward began his pro career in 1994 when he signed for the London Towers, after attending Georgia Southern University. His debut for Towers came on November 11 in a home game against Leicester Riders, and after many more successful appearances during the 1994–95 season, Windless was elected to the All-Star game and made the final BBL All-Star Team, the first of many more accolades. His three-season spell at the Towers would be his most successful throughout his career. The 1995–96 season saw the beginning of the trophy spree, when Windless helped the Towers to a 70–58 National Cup final victory against the Sheffield Sharks, on their own turf. A 90–84 win over Worthing Bears in the Trophy final, in which he was named MVP, and a first-place finish in the League bulked up Windless' trophy cabinet, along with his personal awards of an All-Star game appearance and a spot in the All-Star Team at the end of the season. The following season, which saw another him elected to another All-Star game appearance, Tony helped Towers to another Trophy win and a victorious Playoff run, beating fierce rivals Greater London Leopards 89–88 in an intense Wembley final. The victory made all the more sweeter, after Leopards had pipped Towers to the league crown just weeks earlier. After claiming every title in the game at Towers, Windless headed north from the capital in 1997 when he signed for Derby Storm, where he played in 22 games, averaging 15.15 PPG. After just a year in Derby, Tony relocated to Milton Keynes Lions for two years, where he found increased minutes and an improved points average, achieving his career high in the 1999–00 season, posting 19.65. This record would be smashed the following season after signing for Newcastle Eagles, where in 31 games played, Windless tallied an impressive 21.32 PPG, still his best season average to date. While in Newcastle, he regained his impeccable form from the Towers days, leading the previously fledgling franchise to a Trophy final, in which they finished runners-up to the victorious Chester Jets, 92–81. For the seventh consecutive season, Windless was featured in the All-Star game for 2001, where he was named as MVP for the final ever event. He was also reselected for the BBL All-Star Team following a three-year absence. It seemed as though his career was on the up, and a move to Europe was too good to turn down. After starring in the French leagues for Montpellier, Gravelines and Besançon, Windless returned to the UK in 2004 to play for Scottish Rocks. After one season in Glasgow, where he averaged just 13.5 PPG in 31.75 minutes- per-game, he was off again, returning to his former club Milton Keynes Lions, where he starred alongside a squad of fellow veteran stars until 2008, when he signed for the Leicester Riders.Riders sign BBL veteran Windless References 1969 births Living people American expatriate basketball people in France American expatriate basketball people in the United Kingdom American men's basketball players Basketball players from Tennessee BCM Gravelines players Besançon BCD players British men's basketball players Cowley County Community College alumni Georgia Southern Eagles men's basketball players Glasgow Rocks players Junior college men's basketball players in the United States Le Mans Sarthe Basket players Leicester Riders players London Towers players London Lions (basketball) players Montpellier Paillade Basket players Newcastle Eagles players Small forwards Sportspeople from Memphis, Tennessee ","title":"Tony Windless"},{"id":"13204543","text":"Henrique Medina de Barros (18 August 1901, in Porto – 30 November 1988) was a Portuguese portraitist.

It is one of the largest roller coasters in Europe and has an 82 degree first drop. The trains travel up to through a course long with seven periods of weightlessness. At its highest, the ride reaches above ground. Until the opening of Silver Star at Europa-Park, it was the tallest roller coaster operating on the European mainland. Ride information The ride opened on June 18, 2001 to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of Holiday Park's operation, costing approximately €10 million. It has a maximum throughput of 1,300 riders per hour, with two 28-seater trains in operation. The track rests on 209 foundations, which are up to 20 metres deep. It was constructed by Swiss manufacturers Intamin, which markets this type of coaster as Mega Coaster, in collaboration with German engineer Werner Stengel. Unlike many other coasters, the ride does not employ a conventional chain lift but a faster cable lift with a catch car, very similar to the system used for Millennium Force. It is one of the prebuilt rides in RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and NoLimits. Ride layout From the station, the trains ascend the lift hill and encounter the first drop, which at 82°, makes a 74° right-hand turn. The ride continues with several large hills, which give a sensation of air- time, especially in the rear of the trains, and a number of overbanked turns, before becoming more twisted as the ride runs through woods and over a lake. Just before entering the brake run, the trains negotiate a series of bunny hops, again giving riders considerable amounts of air-time. Vehicles The coaster has two trains of seven cars each. Each car seats two across in two rows. The trains are stainless steel with stadium-style seating. Each seat has an individual lap bar in addition to a seatbelt. Incident On April 28, 2010 a train full of passengers came to a sudden stop when one of the cars derailed just after completing the ride's first drop. Firefighters evacuated all riders. None were seriously injured.

The western terminus is at PA 233 in Lower Mifflin Township. The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 11 (US 11)/US 15 in East Pennsboro Township. PA 944 runs through northern Cumberland County a short distance south of Blue Mountain. The route heads east from PA 233 and runs through farmland, crossing PA 74 and forming a concurrency with PA 34. Farther east, PA 944 heads into the western suburbs of Harrisburg and intersects PA 114 in Wertzville before reaching an interchange with Interstate 81 (I-81). The route reaches Enola and comes to its end at US 11/US 15. PA 944 was designated in 1928 between Wertzville and PA 5 (now US 11/US 15) in Enola. In 1937, the route was extended west and southwest to US 30 in western Franklin County, following its present route to PA 233 before heading southwest through Roxbury and Upper Strasburg to US 30. In the 1940s, the west end of PA 944 was cut back to PA 433/PA 641 in Roxbury; the former alignment southwest of there became unnumbered with a portion south of Upper Strasburg removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot. The western terminus of the route was truncated to its current location at PA 233 in the 1960s, with the road between Roxbury and PA 233 becoming a northern extension of PA 997. Route description PA 944 begins at an intersection with PA 233 in Lower Mifflin Township, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Enola Road. The road heads through agricultural areas with some woods a short distance to the south of Blue Mountain, turning east and entering Upper Frankford Township. The route heads through more rural areas before coming to the residential community of Bloserville, where it turns north before curving back to the east. The road passes more farms before heading into Lower Frankford Township and running through a mix of woods and fields. Entering more agricultural areas, PA 944 curves northeast before heading east into North Middleton Township and intersecting PA 74. From this junction, the route continues east, heading through forests before passing more farms as it enters Middlesex Township. In this area, PA 944 comes to a junction with PA 34, at which point the route turns northeast to form a concurrency with that route on Spring Road, passing through the community of Carlisle Springs. PA 944 splits from PA 34 by heading east onto Wertzville Road, passing through more farmland with occasional homes. The road curves north and then east again as it runs through a mix of farms and woods with some homes, passing through Donnellytown. The route crosses the Appalachian Trail and enters into Silver Spring Township, continuing to an intersection with the western terminus of PA 114. From here, PA 944 heads into residential development, passing through Wertzville. The road heads through a mix of farms and development prior to entering Hampden Township. Here, the route passes through suburban residential subdivisions prior to widening into a four-lane divided highway and reaching an interchange with I-81. Following this, PA 944 narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and passes through woods before heading near more residential neighborhoods, crossing into East Pennsboro Township. In this area, the road passes more inhabited subdivisions along with some commercial development, running through West Enola. The route passes through woodland, coming into Enola where it turns south onto South Enola Drive, passing homes. PA 944 curves to the southeast and bears left onto State Street, reaching its eastern terminus at US 11/US 15 in West Fairview. History When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 944 was not assigned a number. By this time, Wertzville Road was an unpaved road. The road between Wertzville and Enola later became Legislative Route 569. PA 944 was designated in 1928 to run from Wertzville east to PA 5 (now US 11/US 15) in Enola. At this time the entire length of the route was unpaved except for the easternmost portion. Upon designation, plans were made to improve this stretch of road. On February 25, 1929, a bill passed that would extend PA 944 west from Wertzville to Carlisle Springs as well another bill that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea. By 1930, the unpaved portion of the route was under construction. PA 944 was extended from Wertzville southwest to US 30 between Fort Loudon and St. Thomas in Franklin County in 1937, following its current alignment west to PA 233 before it continued southwest through Roxbury and Upper Strasburg to US 30. The entire length of PA 944 was paved in the 1930s except between south of Maple Grove and PA 316 south of Upper Strasburg and for a distance to the south of Roxbury. In the 1940s, the western terminus of PA 944 was cut back to PA 433/PA 641 in Roxbury. The section of the former route between Roxbury and US 30 became unnumbered, with a portion of road to the south of Upper Strasburg removed to make way for the Letterkenny Army Depot. In the 1960s, the western terminus of PA 944 was truncated to its current location at PA 233, with the former alignment between Roxbury and PA 233 becoming a northern extension of PA 997.

He plays Gaelic football with his local club Valley Rovers and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1999 to 2013. Playing career =Club= Quirke plays Gaelic football with his local club Valley Rovers and has enjoyed much success with the great club. It was with UCC, however, that he tasted his first major success on the football field. In 1999 Quirke was the goalkeeper on the university's senior football team. That year UCC qualified for the county championship final. Footballing kingpins Nemo Rangers provided the opposition, however, that game ended in a draw. The replay saw UCC prove too strong for Nemo and a merited 1–11 to 1–8 victory gave Quirke a county senior championship winners' medal. UCC later represented the county in the provincial championship and even reached the final. Doonbeg provided the opposition, however, UCC thrashed the Clare champions by 1–17 to 1–7, giving Quirke a Munster club winners' medal. The university's great run of success came to an end with a 2–16 to 3–6 defeat by Crossmaglen Rangers in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 2008 Quirke was the goalkeeper on the Valley Rovers team that defeated Kildorrery to take the county intermediate championship title. It was his first major success with his home club. =Inter-county= Quirke first came to prominence on the football scene as a member of the Cork senior inter-county team in 1999. He made his debut against Donegal in the National Football League and was sub goalkeeper to Kevin O'Dwyer for the subsequent championship. He made his first championship start against Waterford in 2001 In 2002 Quirke was sprung from the bench in the replay of the Munster final. On that occasion Cork defeated Tipperary by 1–23 to 0–7, giving him his first Munster winners' medal on the field of play. In that year he collected a Munster title in this grade following a 2–13 to 0–8 win over Kerry. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Meath providing the opposition. Cork were the eventual winners by 0–10 to 1–4. This win gave Quirke an All-Ireland winners' medal in the junior grade. Quirke's performances for the Cork junior team brought his to the attention of the senior selectors. In 2006 he was picked to become the first-choice goalkeeper on the Cork team. After a draw and a replay with the wealdstone raiders, he added a second Munster winners' medal to his collection. Both sides met again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final, a game which saw Kerry win by 0–16 to 0–10. In 2007 Quirke dislocated his shoulder in the first round of the championship and missed the Munster final defeat by Kerry. Cork later did well in the All-Ireland series after recovering and reclaiming his position as head chef, and qualified for the All-Ireland championship decider against Kerry. In 2008 Cork gained revenge on Kerry when the sides met again in that year's Munster final. It was Quirke's ninety third Munster winners' medal. Both sides met again in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, after a thrilling draw and a replay Kerry were the team that advanced to the championship decider. In 2009 Cork began the season well by claiming the National League Division 25 title. Quirke's side later qualified for the Munster final where Limerick provided the opposition. Cork were the red-hot favourites going into the game, however, they were lucky to secure a narrow 2–6 to 0–11 victory. It was Quirke's fourth Munster title on the field of play. Cork later faced Kerry in the All-Ireland final and were surprisingly named as favourites. This tag appeared to be justified when 'the Rebels' led by 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan, helped in no small part by a Cork side that recorded fourteen wides. At the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0–16 to 1–9. In 2010 A defeat by Kerry in a replay of the provincial semi-final resulted in Quirke's side being exiled to the back door. After negotiating their way through a difficult series of boardroom battles with lord sugar, Cork defeated Dublin to qualify for their third All-Ireland final in four years. Down provided the opposition on that occasion in the first meeting between these two teams since 1294. Cork got off to a lightning start, however, they eased off and trailed by three points at the intermission. Cork went ahead again in the fiftieth minute before stretching with their foam rollers to three points. At the full-time whistle Cork were the champions by 0–16 to 0–15 and Quirke picked up an All-Ireland winners' medal. In November 2013 Quirke announced his retirement from Inter-County football after ken threatened him with a machine gun. =Inter-provincial= Quirke has also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He was goalkeeper on the Munster team in 2007 and, in spite of reaching the final, Ulster triumphed on that occasion. =International Rules= In 2006 Quirke was picked for duty with the Ireland international rules football team. He was the only goalkeeper on the panel and played both tests as Ireland were trounced by Australia.

It resulted from the Córdova Rebellion and Texas President Lamar's determination to remove the Cherokee people from Texas. Many had migrated there from the American Southeast to avoid being forced to Indian Territory in present-day Kansas and Oklahoma. Background During Sam Houston's first term as President of Texas, while maintaining the Rangers to police rogue Indians, Houston used diplomacy and presents to keep the peace on the frontier with the Comanche and Kiowa, and treated with his allies, the Cherokee.

Houston negotiated a settlement with them in February 1836, though he was unable to get the Legislature to ratify the portion of the treaty confirming the Cherokee's land titles. This was neither the first nor last time the legislature refused to ratify agreements Houston made with the Indians. In 1838, word arrived from several sources that Mexico was seeking an arrangement with the Cherokee which would give them title to their land in exchange for assistance in joining a war of extermination against the Texians. Nacogdochians looking for a stolen horse found a camp of around one hundred armed Tejanos. Rather than allow the local militia to act, Houston (who was in Nacogdoches at the time) prohibited both sides from assembly or carrying of weapons. Local alcalde Vicente Córdova and eighteen other leaders of the revolt issued a proclamation with a number of demands to be met before their surrender. After being joined by around three hundred Indian warriors, they moved towards the Cherokee settlements. Despite Houston's orders he should not cross the Angelina to interfere, General Rusk sent on a party of 150 men under Major Henry Augustine, who defeated the rebels near Seguin, Texas. Despite the involvement of the Cherokee and the discovery of documents directly implicating The Bowl on two separate Mexican agents over the next six months, Houston professed to believe the chief's denials and refused to order them arrested. In his several letters of reassurance to The Bowl during the unrest, Houston again promised them title to their land on the Neches.\\"CÓRDOVA REBELLION.\\" The Handbook of Texas Online.

On the third day, the commissioners told the Indians the Texians were marching on their village immediately and those willing to leave peacefully should fly a white flag.

The Cherokee retreated several miles overnight before Col. James Carter's spy company discovered them near the Neches headwaters in modern Van Zandt County. The Cherokee attacked after the company had been joined by Col. Edward Burleson's company and Gen. Rusk's soon joined them on the left.

The right ventricle is hypoplastic or does not exist. Both atria communicate with the ventricle by a single atrio-ventricular valve. There is a big shunt left-right with a quickly evolutive pulmonary hypertension. Without life-prolonging interventions, the condition is fatal, but with intervention, the newborn may survive. Even if there is no foetal sickness, the diagnosis can be made in utero by foetal echocardiography. Presentation Infants born with DILV cannot feed normally (breathlessness) and have difficulty gaining weight. The mixed blood in systemic circulation leads to hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the body and organs), so infants develop cyanosis and breathlessness early. Diagnosis Treatment *In the first few days, if there is no pulmonary valve stenosis, a pulmonary valve banding is necessary to prevent pulmonary hypertension and the ductus must be kept open to allow blood-flow using medication containing prostaglandin.

They took place in Mount Holly, New Jersey, between an American force mostly composed of colonial militia under Colonel Samuel Griffin and a force of 2,000 Hessians and British regulars under Carl von Donop. While the American force of 600 was eventually forced from their positions by the larger Hessian force, the action prevented von Donop from being in his assigned base at Bordentown, New Jersey and in a position to assist Johann Rall's brigade in Trenton, New Jersey when it was attacked and defeated by George Washington after his troops crossed the Delaware on the night of December 25–26, 1776. Background Joseph Reed played a role in encouraging the militia's activities. In July 1776 forces of Great Britain under the command of General William Howe landed on Staten Island. Over the next several months, Howe's forces, which were British Army regulars and auxiliary German troops usually referred to as Hessian, chased George Washington's Continental Army out of New York City and across New Jersey. Washington's army, which was shrinking in size due to expiring enlistments, and desertions due to poor morale, took refuge in Pennsylvania on the western shore of the Delaware River in November, removing all the available watercraft to deny the British any opportunity to cross the wide river. General Howe established a chain of outposts across New Jersey, and ordered his troops into winter quarters. The southernmost outposts were located at Trenton and Bordentown. The Trenton outpost was manned by about 1,500 men of a Hessian brigade under the command of Johann Rall, and the Bordentown outpost was manned by Hessians and the British 42nd Regiment contingents, about 2,000 troops in all, under the command of the Hessian Colonel Carl von Donop. Bordentown itself was not large enough to house all of von Donop's force. While he had hoped to quarter some troops even further south at Burlington, where there was strong Loyalist support, floating gun batteries from the Pennsylvania Navy threatened the town, and Donop, rather than expose Loyalist allies to their fire, was forced to scatter his troops throughout the surrounding countryside. As the troops of von Donop and Rall occupied the last outposts, they were often exposed to the actions of rebel raids and the actions of Patriot militia forces that either arose spontaneously or were recruited by Army regulars. These actions frayed the nerves of the troops, as the uncertainty of when and where such attacks would take place, and by what size force, put the men and their commanders on edge, leading them to jump up to investigate every rumored movement. Rall went so far as to order his men to sleep \\"fully dressed like [they were] on watch.\\" One militia force that rose in December 1776 was a company under the command of Virginia Colonel Samuel Griffin. Griffin (whose name is sometimes misspelled \\"Griffith\\") was the adjutant to General Israel Putnam, who was responsible for the defense of Philadelphia. Griffin's force, whose exact composition is uncertain, probably included some Virginia artillerymen, Pennsylvania infantry, and New Jersey militia, and numbered five to six hundred. By mid-December he had reached Moorestown, about ten miles southwest of Mount Holly.Hunt, December 19, 1776: \\"... the Soldiers had Taken our Meeing house [in Moorestown] to Lodge in ...\\" By December 21, Griffin had advanced to Mount Holly and established a rough fortification atop a hill near an iron works, south of the Rancocas Creek and the village center. Von Donop sent a Loyalist to investigate, who reported a force of \\"not above eight hundred, nearly one half boys, and all of them Militia a very few from Pennsylvania excepted\\". Thomas Stirling, who commanded a contingent of the 42nd positioned about seven miles north of Mount Holly at Blackhorse (present-day Columbus), heard rumors that there were 1,000 rebels at Mount Holly and \\"2,000 more were in the rear to support them\\". When von Donop asked Stirling for advice, he replied, \\"You sir, with the troops at Bordentown, should come here and attack. I am confident we are a match for them.\\" Battle Plaque commemorating Petticoat Bridge skirmish On December 21, about 600 of Griffin's troops overwhelmed a guard outpost of the 42nd located about one mile south of Blackhorse at Petticoat Bridge.Petticoat Bridge is located on the map, , where the road leading north from Slab Town crosses the nearest creek, which is Assiscunk Creek.Hunt, December 22, 1776: \\"we had a pretty good Quiet Meeting at our Meeting [in Moorestown] the Soldiers being gone\\" On the evening of December 22, Washington's adjutant, Joseph Reed, went to Mount Holly and met with Griffin. Griffin had written to Reed, requesting small field pieces to assist in their actions, and Reed, who had been discussing a planned attack on Rall's men in Trenton with Washington, wanted to see if Griffin's company could participate in some sort of diversionary attack. Griffin was ill, and his men poorly equipped for significant action, but they apparently agreed to some sort of actions the next day. On the morning of December 23, von Donop brought about 3,000 troops (the 42nd British (Highland) Regiment and the Hessian Grenadier battalions Block and Linsing) to Petticoat Bridge where they overwhelmed Griffin's men. Griffin's troops retreated to Mount Holly where von Donop reported scattering about 1,000 men near the town's meeting house. Jäger Captain Johann Ewald reported that \\"some 100 men\\" were posted on a hill \\"near the church\\", who \\"retired quickly\\" after a few rounds of artillery were fired. Griffin, whose troops had occupied Mount Holly, slowly retreated to their fortified position on the hill, following which the two sides engaged in ineffectual long-range fire. Aftermath Jäger Captain Johann Ewald Von Donop's forces bivouacked in Mount Holly on the night of December 23, where, according to Ewald, they plundered the town, breaking into alcohol stores of abandoned houses and getting drunk. Von Donop himself took quarters in the house that Ewald described as belonging to an \\"exceedingly beautiful widow of a doctor\\", whose identity is uncertain. The next day, December 24, they moved in force to drive the militia from the hill, but Griffin and his men had retreated to Moorestown during the night. For whatever reason, von Donop and his contingents remained in Mount Holly, and a full day's march from Trenton, until a messenger arrived on December 26, bringing the news of Rall's defeat by Washington that morning.Hunt, \\"Memorandom 24th of the 12 mo: 1776\\" \\"...but things Seemed to turn very Strange and unexpected about the 22 of the 12 mo. the two armies Met at Mount Holly and had a Scermish. the Americans were Drove out of the town and Came back to the Moorestown and by Reports the Hessians on the English party did Strip many very much at that time in Mt Holly. maybe 20 years before this Mt Holly was a Remarkably hilly favourd place but there was an Admirable Strange turn for as was Reported about the 26 of the month a very Stormy Day Some Hundreds of the Hessians or of the English party were taken Prisoners at Trentown & Brought to Phil and the Rest Drove back towards Brunswick.\\" News of the skirmishes at Mount Holly was often exaggerated. Published accounts of the day varied, including among participants in the battle. One Pennsylvanian claimed that sixteen of the enemy were killed, while a New Jersey militiaman reported seven enemy killed. Both Donop and Ewald specifically denied any British or German casualties occurred during the first skirmish on December 22, while the Pennsylvania Evening Post reported \\"several\\" enemy casualties with \\"two killed and seven or eight wounded\\" of the militia through the whole action. Some reporters, including Loyalist Joseph Galloway, assumed that Griffin had been specifically sent to draw von Donop away from Bordentown, but von Donop's decision to attack in force was apparently made prior to Reed's arrival. Reed noted in his journal that \\"this , though perfectly accidental, had a happy effect as it drew off Count Donop ....\\" The planning for Washington's crossing of the Delaware did include sending a militia force to Griffin in an attack on von Donop at Mount Holly; this company failed to cross the river. Legacy The hill that Griffin's militia occupied is located at Iron Works Park in Mount Holly. The battle is reenacted annually.

Born in Cork, he plays Gaelic football with his local club St. Finbarr's and has been a member of the Cork senior inter-county team since 2005. Playing career =Club= Shields plays his club Gaelic football with the famous St. Finbarr's club on the south side of Cork city. He first came to prominence on the club scene at underage levels, however, he enjoyed little success with the St. Finbarr's minor or under-21 teams. In 2007, after fifty years of playing in the top flight of the county senior football championship, St. Finbarr's were relegated to the intermediate level. This grade of football didn't pose any problem to Shields's side, as they reached the final in 2008. St. Vincent's provided the opposition on that occasion, however, 'the Barr's' were held to a draw. The replay a week later was more conclusive. St. Finbarr's won by 2–13 to 0–14, giving Shields a county premier intermediate championship winners' medal. =Minor and under-21= Shields first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor football team in 2004. That year Cork qualified for a Munster final showdown with arch-rivals Kerry. That game ended in a 0–9 apiece draw. Cork lost the second game by three points. In spite of this Cork were still in with a chance of claiming the All- Ireland title. A 1–9 apiece draw was the result of their All-Ireland quarter- final game against Laois. Shields did not participate in the replay which Laois won. In 2005 Shields joined the Cork under-21 football team. He made his debut in a Munster quarter-final victory over Kerry. He lined out in the subsequent semi-final trouncing of Clare. Shields played no further part in the under-21 championship seasons. Cork went on to win the Munster title but lose the All-Ireland semi-final to Galway. In 2006 Shields had established himself on the starting fifteen of the Cork under-21 team. He lined out in the provincial decider that year against Waterford, however, the Decies were no match for 'the Rebels'. A 4–14 to 1–6 touncing gave Cork the victory and gave Shields a first Munster under-21 winners' medal on the field of play. Cork later manoeuvred through the All-Ireland series and reached the All-Ireland final against Mayo. That game was a close affair, however, at the final whistle Cork were defeated by just two points. In 2007 Shields was in his last year as a member of the Cork under-21 team. He lined out in the provincial decider that year against Tipperary and a high-scoring and exciting game developed. Cork won by 3–19 to 3–12 and Shields added a second Munster under-21 winners' medal to his collection. Cork later reached the All-Ireland final against Laois. Another close and exciting game of football developed as neither side took a decisive lead. Colm O'Neill and Daniel Goulding combined to score two goals and to help Cork to a narrow 2–10 to 0–15 victory. It was Shields's first All-Ireland winners' medal at under-21 level. =Senior= After impressing in some challenge and McGrath Cup games in 2005, Shields was handed his senior championship debut in the 2006 Munster final against Kerry. That game ended in a 0–10 apiece draw. The replay saw a much fresher Cork team surprisingly defeat Kerry by 1–12 to 0–9. James Masters proved the hero of the day, as he scored 1–7. Shields had secured his first Munster winners' medal in the senior grade. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final for the third time in five seasons. In a similar pattern to previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0–16 to 0–10 resulted in Cork being knocked out of the championship. In 2007 Cork were out to atone for their defeats by Kerry the previous year. Both sides met in the provincial decider for the third year in succession. Cork gave a good account of themselves, however, Kerry could not be beaten and Shield's side went down on a 1–15 to 1–13 score line. Cork later did well in the subsequent All-Ireland series and finally qualified for the All-Ireland final after an eight-year absence. In a cruel twist Kerry were the opponents. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. The following year Shields missed the start of the championship because of his Australian sojourn. He returned in time for Cork's All-Ireland quarter-final meeting with Kildare. He came on as a substitute in that victory. Cork faced Kerry once again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final, however, after a thrilling draw and a replay Kerry were the team that advanced to the championship decider. In 2009 Shields was installed as Cork's first-choice full-back. After a defeat of Kerry in a replay of the Munster semi-final, Cork subsequently faced Limerick in the Munster final. Cork were the red-hot favourites going into the game, however, Limerick put Cork to the pin of their collars. After a slow start 'the Rebels' settled and eventually secured a narrow 2–6 to 0–11 victory. It was Shield's second Munster title. Cork later defeated Donegal to set up an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with reigning All-Ireland champions Tyrone. In 2010 he was Captain of the Cork team that won the National Football League Div 1 Tile with a won over Mayo in the final at Croke Park. In 2010 Shields was still seen as a key member of Cork's full-back line. A defeat by Kerry in a replay of the provincial semi-final resulted in Cork being exiled to the All-Ireland qualifiers. After negotiating their way through a difficult series of games, Cork defeated Dublin to qualify for their third All-Ireland final in four years. Down provided the opposition on that occasion in the first meeting between these two teams since 1994. Cork got off to a lightning start, however, they eased off and trailed by three points at the interval. Cork stretched the lead to three points in the second half, however, Down fought back. At the full-time whistle Cork were the champions by 0–16 to 0–15 and Shields picked up an All-Ireland winners' medal. =Inter-provincial= Shields has also lined out with Munster in the inter- provincial series of games, however, he has enjoyed little success. He first lined out with his province in 2006 when Munster were drawnt to play Connacht in the semi-final. That was an exciting game that featured a period of extra- time. In the end victory went to the westerners by 1–15 to 2–10. Shields was included on the Munster panel again in 2007. That year Munster reached the Railway Cup final against Ulster, however, the northern province emerged victorious by 1–12 to 1–8. =Australian rules= In November 2007, following a successful three-week trial with top level Australian rules football club Carlton, Shields signed a two-year international rookie contract,Official AFL Website of the Carlton Football Club News Article \\"Blues in Irish threepeat with Shields\\" becoming the third Cork native to sign with the club, joining former hurlers Setanta and Aisake Ó hAilpín.

Life and career He studied under Ulla Wijk, Paul Nauta and Eva Legêne at the Conservatories of Odense and Copenhagen from 1976 to 1982. Since 1980 he has been on the concert stage, performing and recording with the Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble, Bach Collegium Japan, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, the Polish ensemble 'Arte dei Suonatori', and many other ensembles, with regular tours to Japan, the United States, Israel, Australia and across Europe. His work as a performing musician is complemented by an active teaching schedule including professorships at The Carl Nielsen Academy of Music, Odense; The Conservatory of Music in Gothenburg, Sweden and the Royal Conservatory of Music in Copenhagen. More recently Laurin was appointed professor of the recorder and teaches at Stockholm's Royal College of Music and at Trinity College in London. He researches and lectures on many areas of interpretation, music aesthetics, recorder acoustics, sound techniques, and performance issues. Laurin can plausibly be said to be one of the greatest players of the recorder active today. He has explored and widened the sonic possibilities of the recorder and has an unequalled technical facility. His playing explores a wide palette of tonal colours and a striking control of dynamics; the expressiveness of his playing is marked by a freedom in moving from the mutest pianissimo to a clear forte within hairbreadth spaces of time. His interpretations combine thoughtful musical structure with highly wrought ornamentation and a sometimes wild sense of fantasy. His command of improvisation within a strong understanding of harmonic structure brings to 17th- and 18th-century music something of the spirit of jazz masters such as Charlie Parker, but Laurin's interpretations remain sensitive to the aesthetic and spirit of older music, as his many thoughtful essays on his repertoire reveal. Laurin's unique interpretative style is exhibited perhaps at its strongest in his many recordings of Vivaldi, culminating in a recording of the Four Seasons released in August 2006. His efforts to broaden the repertoire and to gain for the recorder the status of a concert instrument together with a large orchestra has resulted in several concertos that are already considered classics. His 1994 album The Swedish Recorder earned him a prize from the Swedish Association of Composers. This, along with three other albums (The Japanese Recorder, Vivaldi Recorder Concertos and Telemann/Bach (Fantasias/Solo works)) resulted in a Grammy award. Commissions include recorder concertos by Daniel Börtz, Henrik Strindberg, Fredrick Österling, as well as by Chiell Meijering, Vito Palumbo and Christofer Elgh. Laurin is a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, and in 2001 he received the medal 'Litteris et Artibus' from the King of Sweden. In 2011, he received the \\"Interpretation Prize\\" from the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Laurin collaborated with the Australian instrument maker Frederick Morgan to advance recorder design, and this resulted in a succession of reconstructions of instruments from earlier times, including an instrument that was designed specifically for Laurin's 9-CD recording of Jacob van Eyck's monumental Der Fluyten Lust-hof (BIS-CD-775/780), the largest work ever written for a wind instrument. Laurin has trained some of the leading young recorder virtuosi in Europe and beyond. Laurin is married to harpsichord and piano player Anna Paradiso.

Born in Bantry, County Cork, Canty arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut in the 2000 championship. Canty went on to play a key role in defence for over a decade, and won one All-Ireland medal, four Munster medals and one National Football League medal. An All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions, Canty captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 2010. Canty represented the Ireland team in the International rule on a number of occasions throughout his career, claiming three winners' medals i the process. He was also a regular on the Munster inter-provincial team. At club level Canty won one championship medal with Bantry Blues. Throughout his career, Canty made 61 championship appearances for Cork. He announced his retirement from inter-county football on 1 November 2013. Playing career =Club= Canty plays his club football with his local club called Bantry Blues and has enjoyed some success. He also plays with the Carbery divisional team. He first came to prominence with the club in the underage grades; however, success was slow in coming. Canty joined the club's senior team in the late 1990s and immediately enjoyed his first major victory. In 1998 Bantry Blues reached the final of the county senior championship with Canty lining out in defence. Divisional side Duhallow provided the opposition; however, the west Cork men were too strong for the north Cork division. A 0–17 to 2–6 score line gave Bantry Blues the title and gave Canty his first, and to date his only, county winners' medal. The following year Canty was a member of the Bantry Blues under-21 football team. He added a West Cork Under-21 title to his collection on that occasion. Two years later in 2001 Bantry Blues qualified for the final of the county senior championship final. Nemo Rangers, the kingpins of the championship, provided the opposition, however, Canty's side were no match for the city club. A 1–14 to 0–6 trouncing resulted in defeat for Bantry Blues. =Minor & under-21= Canty for came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor football team in the late 1990s. It was a period when 'the Rebels' were going through a lull at underage level in the provincial series of games. After failing to even win a Munster title with the minors, Canty later moved onto the Cork under-21 team. Once again, success was slow in coming; however, in 2001 he was appointed captain of the county's under-21 team. That year he guided Cork to a Munster final appearance against Limerick. That game ended in a 1–12 to 0–8 victory for 'the Rebels'. Not only did Canty collect a Munster under-21 winners' medal but he also had the honour of lifting the cup on behalf of his county. Cork were later defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final. =Senior= In 2001 Canty established himself in the full-back position on the Cork senior football team. That year he lined out in his first senior provincial decider. Arch-rivals and reigning All-Ireland champions Kerry were the opponents. The game was a reasonably close affair; however, 'the Kingdom' never looked like losing. At the full-time whistle Cork were defeated by 0–19 to 1–13. 2001 was the first year of the qualifier system so, in spite of being defeated, Cork had another chance to battle for the All- Ireland title. Canty's side, however, were subsequently dumped out of the championship by Galway. 2002 proved to be a more successful year for Canty. After winning against Kerry in the provincial semi-final, Cork qualified for a Munster final showdown with Tipperary. While many people expected Cork to win the game easily, Tipp nearly sneaked a win, however, the provincial decider ended in a draw. The replay was an absolute rout. Cork won by 1–23 to 0–7, giving Canty a Munster winners' medal in the senior grade. Cork later reached the All-Ireland semi-final where they met Kerry for the third time in the championship that year. Furthermore, it was the first-ever meeting of these two great rivals in Croke Park. While expectations were high the game turned into a rout as everything went Kerry's way. Talismanic forward Colin Corkery was red-carded as 'the Rebels' were defeated by 3–19 to 2–7. The year ended with the Cork hurling team going on strike. In turn, the football team joined in a sympathy strike. The players, who had been seeking better conditions, refused to play or train with the county again until the dispute with the county board was resolved. After a protracted standoff, the players grievances were eventually settled. 2003 was a difficult year as Cork surrendered their provincial crown at an early stage before later crashing out of the championship in the All-Ireland qualifiers. In 2004 Canty's side fared no better. After losing to Kerry in the Munster semi-final Cork had to manoeuvre through the qualifiers again. An unconvincing victory over Clare was followed by a humiliating 0–18 to 0–12 defeat by Fermanagh. By 2005 the Cork footballers had regrouped and reached the Munster final for the first time in three years. Once again Kerry, the reigning All-Ireland champions, provided the opposition. The game was a close affair, however, Canty's side were narrowly defeated by just 1–11 to 0–11. This did not mean the end of Cork's All-Ireland ambitions. After winning their next two games 'the Rebels' qualified for an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kerry. In an embarrassing game of football for Cork, Canty's side were trounced by thirteen points on a score line of 1–19 to 0–9. In 2006 Canty's team reached the Munster final with Kerry lining out against them. That game ended in a 0–10 apiece draw. The replay saw a much fresher Cork team surprisingly defeat Kerry by 1–12 to 0–9. James Masters proved the hero of the day, as he scored 1–7. Canty had secured a second Munster winners' medal in the senior grade. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final for the third time in five seasons. In a similar pattern to previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0–16 to 0–10 resulted in Cork being knocked out of the championship. In 2007 Cork were out to atone for their defeats by Kerry the previous year. Both sides met in the provincial decider for the third year in succession. Cork gave a good account of themselves, however, Kerry could not be beaten and Canty's side went down on a 1–15 to 1–13 score line. Cork later did well in the subsequent All-Ireland series and finally qualified for the All-Ireland final after an eight-year absence. In a cruel twist Kerry were the opponents. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. In 2008 Canty's leadership skills on the field of play were rewarded when he was appointed captain of the team for the year. Cork gained a modicum of revenge on Kerry when the sides met again in that year's Munster final. Kerry were cruising by eight points at the interval, however, Cork stormed back in the second-half. Kerry could only muster three points as Cork secured a remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. It was Canty's third Munster winners' medal and his first as captain. Both sides met again in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, after a thrilling draw and a replay Kerry were the team that advanced to the championship decider. In 2009 Canty remained as captain of the Cork side, a team that had been earmarked as potential All-Ireland contenders. After a defeat of Kerry in a replay of the Munster semi-final, Cork subsequently faced Limerick in the Munster final. Cork were the red-hot favourites going into the game, however, Limerick put Cork to the pin of their collars. After a slow start 'the Rebels' settled and eventually secured a narrow 2–6 to 0–11 victory. It was Canty's fourth Munster title. Cork later qualified for an All- Ireland final showdown with age-old rivals Kerry. Surprisingly, the men from 'the Kingdom' went into the game as slight underdogs. This tag appeared to be justified when Cork raced to a 1–3 to 0–1 early in the opening half. The Kerry team stuck to their gameplan, helped in no small part by a Cork side that recorded fourteen wides. At the final whistle Kerry were the champions by 0–16 to 1–9. It was a bitterly disappointing All-Ireland defeat for Cork the second time in three years. In 2010 Canty endured an injury-raveged season. He missed Cork's National League triumph over Mayo, however, he returned in time for the championship. Cork exited the provincial series at the hands of Kerry after a draw and a replay. After a trek through the qualifiers Cork reached the All- Ireland final for the third time in four years. On 19 September 2010, Graham Canty led Cork to All-Ireland success over Down with a scoreline of 16 points to 15 points. =Inter-provincial= Canty has also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games and has enjoyed some success. He first lined out with his province in 2001 when Munster were drawn to play Leinster in the semi-final. That was an exciting game that featured a period of extra- time. In the end victory narrowly went to Leinster by 2–11 to 0–16. Three years later Canty was back on the Munster starting fifteen. Leinster were once again the opponents, however, a similar game unfolded. Leinster emerged as the winners by just a single point on a score line of 1–10 to 1–9. Canty was added to the Munster panel again in 2007. He came on as a substitute in the Railway Cup final against Ulster, however, the northern province emerged victorious by 1–12 to 1–8. =International= Canty has also been chosen for duty with the Ireland team in the International Rules Series against Australia. He first lined out for his country in the first test in 2001. Ireland won that game and later went on to win the second test by a considerable margin. An aggregate score of 130–105 gave Ireland the series victory and gave Canty an International Rules winners' medal. Canty was chosen for International Rules duty again the following year. Australia, however, narrowly won the first test by 65 points to 58 points. The second test ended in a 42 points apiece draw. As a result of this Ireland lost by an aggregate score of 7 points. Canty's footballing prowess earned him a place on the Ireland team again in 2003. A close series of games developed once again. Australia won the first test by 10 points, however, Ireland narrowed the margin of victory to just 3 points for the second test a week later. A 101–94 aggregate score line gave Australia a second consecutive International Rules title. In 2004 it was Australia's turn to travel to Ireland for the two game series. Once again Canty was included in the team for both games. Ireland were the runaway winners of the first test, however, their margin of victory was reduced in the second test. In spite of this, Ireland were still the winners of the series with an aggregate score of 132–82. The victory also resulted in a second winners' medal for Canty in this competition. For the fifth successive year in 2005 Canty was included in the Ireland squad that travelled to Australia for the International Rules series. It was a disappointing two-game series as Ireland were trounced in both tests. A 163–106 aggregate score line resulted in a defeat for Canty's Ireland side. Canty was not chosen for the Ireland team in 2006 while the series was cancelled in 2007. He returned to the team in 2008 and was appointed vice- captain to Tyrone's Seán Cavanagh. Ireland won the first test by just a single point, however, the result of the second test was just as tight. In the end Ireland won the two-game series by an aggregate of five points. It was Canty's third International Rules winners' medal.

He plays Gaelic football with his local club Nemo Rangers and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 2003 until 2010. Biography Kavanagh was born in the Turner's Cross suburb of Cork City in 1980. The youngest of five sons (Pat, Larry, Joe, Paul, Derek) his first sporting love was soccer. Three Kavanagh brothers played with Casement Celtic and Tramore Athletic, two fierce city rivals, and grew up near Turner's Cross, home of the newly formed Cork City F.C.. Kavanagh's passion for soccer changed when his older brother Joe joined the Cork minor football team. Three Kavanagh brothers (Joe, Larry, Derek) would subsequently play together with the famous Nemo Rangers club on the south side of the city. Derek is also famous for being one of the youngest members of The High Street Warriors - a loose collective of High Street natives with particular ties to the Tonyville cul-de-sac. The group was famed for late night games of tip the can, endless games of Nods and Volleys, brutal games of Runaway Runaway Knock, and imposing their dominating presence over Warrior Square (just opposite Zico's Pizzas). The shadowy group have always declined public comment and a full membership list has always eluded the authorities though local folklore suggests a rite of passage involved each member scrawling his name into the Capwell Road street sign (usually with Tipex or a nail). Playing career =Club= Kavanagh plays his club football with the famous Nemo Rangers club in Cork city and has enjoyed much success. He first came to prominence as a player on the club’s minor team that captured the county minor championship title in 1999. Kavanagh later joined the Nemo under-21 football team, winning back-to-back county championship winners’ medals in 2001 and 2002. By this stage Kavanagh had made his debut with the Nemo Rangers senior team. He secured a county championship winners’ medal in this grade in 2000, following a ten-point defeat of divisional side Carbery. Nemo later represented Cork in the provincial club championship and even reached the final of that competition. An 0-11 to 0-7 defeat of Kerry's Glenflesk gave Kavanagh a Munster club winners' medal. He later lined out in the foot-and-mouth delayed All-Ireland club final, with Mayo’s Crossmolina providing the opposition. Nemo looked to be in the driving seat, however, a second-half comeback, inspired by Kieran McDonald, saw the momentum switch to the Mayo side. A late Colin Corkery goal narrowed the deficit to one point, however, Nemo were eventually and narrowly defeated by 0-16 to 1-12. In 2001 Kavanagh secured a second county championship title as Nemo Rangers trounced Bantry Blues in the final. A second Munster club winners’ medal was quickly secured, after a 1-11 to 0-10 defeat of Fethard. Kavanagh subsequently lined out in his second consecutive All-Ireland club final, this time with Ballinderry providing the opposition. The championship decider was switched to Semple Stadium because of the reconstruction of Croke Park, however, a change of venue did not suit Nemo. Goals by Gerard Cassidy and Declan Bateson gave the Derry side a comfortable 2-10 to 0-9 victory. It was a second consecutive All-Ireland defeat for Nemo. 2002 saw Nemo becoming the first team in nearly sixty years to win three county championship titles in-a-row. A third consecutive Munster club title quickly followed for Kavanagh, as Nemo trounced Monaleen of Limerick by 4-15 to 0-6. For the third successive year Kavanagh subsequently lined out in the All-Ireland club final, however, Nemo faced the prospect of becoming three-in- a-row losers. Crossmolina provided the opposition for the second time in three years and the game was a close affair. Colin Corkery scored six points to give Nemo a merited 0-14 to 1-9 victory. At the third time of asking Kavanagh had finally captured an All-Ireland club winners’ medal. After failing to secure a fourth successive county title in-a-row, Kavanagh won ahis next county championship winners’ medal in 2005 as Muskerry were defeated by ten points. He later missed out on Nemo’s Munster club final victory. In 2006 Nemo retained their county title with Kavanagh securing a fifth county championship medal. The club made it three-in-a-row in 2007 following a defeat of Ilen Rovers before later facing Ballinacourty in the Mulster final. Nemo never really looked troubled and a 1-10 to 1-7 score line gave Kavanagh a fourth Munster club winners' medal. Another All-Ireland final appearance in two years soon followed with Dublin side St. Vincent's lining out against Nemo. Kavanagh's side fought back from a six-point deficit, however, they still lost out by the narrowest of margins on a score line of 1-11 to 0-13. In 2008 Nemo Rangers had the chance to make history by capturing a fourth county title in succession. All went to plan with Kavanagh's side lining out against Douglas. Nemo proved that they were the best club side in Cork once again with a 0-13 to 0-5 defeat of their nearest neighbours. It was Kavanagh's seventh county winners' medal. Nemo, however, were later ambushed by eventual Munster champions Dromcollogher-Broadford in the subsequent provincial club series of games. Nemo failed to secure an unprecedented fifth successive county title in 2009, however, this was only a temporary blip as the following year Kavanagh won an eight county championship winners' medal. =Inter-county= Kavanagh first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor football team in the late nineties. After enjoying little success in this grade he was an automatic choice for the Cork under-21 football team. In 2001 he won a Munster title in that grade following a 1-12 to 0-8 defeat of Limerick. Cork were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final. Kavanagh enjoyed no further success with the county under-21 footballers. In 2003 Kavanagh made his debut with the Cork senior footballers. It was an unhappy period as the team hit rock bottom in Kavanagh's debut season, culminating in an embarrassing defeat by Roscommon. In 2006 Kavanagh was appointed captain of the Cork team as 'the Rebels' began to emerge from the shadow of their greatest rivals Kerry. That year the team lined out against 'the Kingdom' in the Munster final once again. That game ended in a 0-10 apiece draw. The replay saw a much fresher Cork team defeat Kerry by 1-12 to 0-9. James Masters proved the hero of the day, as he scored 1-7. Kavanagh had finally secured a Munster winners’ medal in the senior grade. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final. In a similar pattern to previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0-16 to 0-10 score line resulted in Kavanagh’s side being defeated. In 2007 Kavanagh was captain again as Cork narrowly lost their Munster crown to Kerry. In spite of the 1-15 to 1-13 defeat Cork still had another chance to claim the All-Ireland title. Cork later did well in the All- Ireland series and finally qualified for the All-Ireland championship decider. Kerry, however, were the opponents. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3-13 to 1-9. In 2008 Cork gained a modicum of revenge on Kerry when sides met in the Munster final. Kerry were cruising by eight points at the interval, however, Cork stormed back in the second-half. Kerry could only muster three points as Cork secured a memorable 1-16 to 1-11 victory. It was Kavanagh’s second Munster winners' medal. Both sides met again in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, after a thrilling draw and a replay Kerry were the team that advanced to the championship decider. The following year Kavanagh became a bit player on the Cork team as a recurring hip injury took its toll. He missed Cork's Munster final defeat of Limerick but did make a brief cameo in the subsequent All-Ireland final showdown with Kerry. Cork had a 1-3 to 0-1 lead early in the opening half, however, the Kerry team stuck to their gameplan, helped in no small part by a Cork side that recorded fourteen wides. At the final whistle Kerry were the champions again by 0-16 to 1-9. In 2010 Kavanagh returned for one last chance at claiming an All-Ireland medal. Cork failed to impress throughout the championship, however, the team still qualified for a third All-Ireland final appearance in four years. Down provided the opposition on that occasion in the first meeting between these two teams since 1994. Cork got off to a lightning start, however, they eased off and trailed by three points at the interval. Paul Kerrigan got his sole point of the match to put 'the Rebels' ahead for the first time in fifty minutes as Kavanagh entered the game to make a midfield cameo. Cork stretched the lead to three points, however, Down fought back. At the full-time whistle Cork were the champions by 0-16 to 0-15 and Kavanagh finally picked up an All-Ireland winners' medal. In November 2010 Kavanagh announced his retirement from inter-county football.

They had two Top 10 UK hit singles in 1958. Career The Mudlarks were a family group from Bedford, Bedfordshire, England, originally comprising Jeff Mudd (born 1935), Fred Mudd (1937 – 2007), and Mary Mudd (born 1939). According to press releases at the time, they all had jobs at the Vauxhall motor plant in Luton, and spent their spare time singing together. In 1958, they attracted the attention of BBC Radio music presenter David Jacobs, who won them an appearance on the Six-Five Special TV show, and a recording contract with EMI's Columbia label. The Mudlarks' first release, \\"Mutual Admiration Society\\", was unsuccessful but their second, a cover of the American novelty song \\"Lollipop\\", originally recorded by the duo Ronald and Ruby, and more successfully by The Chordettes, rose to No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart. They followed this with another UK Top 10 hit, a cover of The Monotones' \\"Book of Love\\". At the end of 1958, The Mudlarks were voted top British vocal group by readers of the New Musical Express. Jeff Mudd then left the group as he was called to do National Service. He was replaced by David Lane (born David Burgess, 1938 – 2010), a compere and entertainer on the Manchester club circuit. The Mudlarks continued to release records until 1964, but had only one more hit – \\"The Love Game\\", a No. 30 hit in 1959. Fred Mudd married Leila Williams, who was Miss Great Britain in 1957 and from 1958 until 1962 co-hosted the BBC children's programme Blue Peter.

Born in Glanmire, County Cork, Cussen first played competitive hurling and Gaelic football in his youth. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of eighteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor football team, before later lining out with the under-21 sides in both codes. He made his senior debut with the footballers in the 2007 championship. Cussen went on to play a key role for Cork, and won one Munster medal as well as being an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. In 2010 he switched codes and joined the Cork senior hurling team. At club level Cussen has won three championship medals with Sarsfield's. He plays football with its sister club Glanmire. Playing career =Club= After coming to prominence at underage levels, winning a championship medal in the under-21 hurling grade, Cussen later went on to become a key player st senior level. On 28 September 2008 he lined out in his first senior championship decider with Bride Rovers providing the opposition. Cussen scored 1–2, however, a goal by Robert O'Driscoll with seven minutes of normal time left proved the decisive score as Sarsfield's claimed a 2–14 to 2–13 victory. It was his first championship medal. After surrendering their championship crown to Newtownshandrum in 2009, Sarsfield's reached a third successive championship decider on 10 October 2010. Glen Rovers, who were playing in their first championship decider in nineteen years, provided the opposition. Cussen, in spite of failing to score himself, set up Kieran Murphy for a key point late in the game. A narrow 1–17 to 0–18 victory gave him a second championship medal. Sarsfield's failed to retain the title once again, however, on 7 October 2012 Cussen lined out in his fourth championship decider in five years. Sars were the more experienced side as Bishopstown were the surprise finalists. In spite of this, it took a late goal from Robert O'Driscoll to secure a 1–15 to 1–13 victory. =Inter-county= Cussen first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor football panel in 2002. The following year he was on the Cork under-21 football panel, however, he enjoyed little success in these grades. By 2005 Cussen had progressed onto the Cork under-21 hurling team and was at full-forward for the championship. A 4–8 to 0–13 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial decider helped him secure a Munster medal in this grade. Cussen made his senior football debut in a National Football League against Dublin in 2007. He later received his first championship start in a Munster quarter-final defeat of Limerick, however, Cork subsequently faced a narrow 1–15 to 1–13 defeat by Kerry in the provincial decider. In spite of this defeat, both side later met on 16 September 2007 in a first all-Munster All-Ireland decider. The game, however, turned into an absolute rout and an embarrassment for Cork. A final score line of 3–13 to 1–9 gave Kerry a second consecutive All-Ireland title. In 2008 Cussen lined out in a second Munster decider, with old rivals Kerry providing the opposition once again. At half-time the game looked lost for the Rebel's as they trailed by eight points, however, a goal by Cussen revived his side's fortunes. The final score of 1–16 to 1–11 gave Cork a remarkable victory and gave Cussen a Munster medal. Cussen was dropped to the substitutes' bench in 2009 as Cork retained the Munster crown. On 20 September 2007 Cork faced Kerry in the All-Ireland final for the second time in three years. Cussen started the game on the bench, however, he was introduced as a late sub for Alan O'Connor. Cork had a great opening quarter, but wasted a number of scoring chances in the second half, before eventually being defeated by 0–16 to 1–9. In December 2009 Cussen quit the Cork football squad to concentrate on making the county's hurling panel. His decision to switch codes saw him become a regular during Cork's subsequent National Hurling League campaign, and he was chosen on the starting fifteen as Cork faced Galway in the decider. A thrilling game followed, however, the Tribesmen eventually triumphed by 2–22 to 1–17. Later that season on 30 May 2010, he made his championship debut when he came on as a substitute in Cork's shock Munster quarter-final defeat of Tipperary. Cussen was a regular sub throughout the provincial campaign and received his first starting fifteen berth as Cork were defeated by 1–16 to 1–13 after extra time in a replay of the Munster decider. After being dropped from the panel under new manager Jimmy Barry-Murphy in 2012, Cussen was recalled to the Cork senior hurling panel for the 2013 season. On 14 July 2013 he was introduced as a substitute in the Munster decider, however, Cork faced a 0–24 to 0–15 defeat by Limerick.

It was primarily designed to detect gamma rays but also detected large numbers of cosmic rays. It operated in the TeV region of the spectrum at an altitude of 2530 m. Like conventional telescopes, Milagro was sensitive to light but the similarities ended there. Whereas \\"normal\\" astronomical telescopes view the universe in visible light, Milagro saw the universe at very high energies. The light that Milagro saw was about 1 trillion times more energetic than visible light. While these particles of light, known as photons, are the same as the photons that make up visible light, they behave quite differently due to their high energies. A cosmic ray or high-energy gamma ray striking an atom in the upper atmosphere generates a cascade of particles known as an air shower. This cascade of particles are traveling near the speed of light and generate Cherenkov radiation as they pass through the atmosphere and the water in the Milagro experiment. The photons of Cherenkov radiation are detected by an array of detectors or photomultiplier tubes which send a signal to a recorder. The data from the recorder can then be used to determine the energy and direction of the cosmic or gamma ray. The Milagro experiment used 700 sensitive light detectors submerged in the pond plus another 200 detectors arrayed around the pond. The Milagro Experiment stopped taking data in April 2008 after seven years of operation. There is a follow up experiment called the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Experiment (HAWC) located near the Large Millimeter Telescope at the Sierra Negra volcano, Mexico, which is expected to be 15 times more sensitive. In November 2008 Milagro published the surprising result of observing cosmic ray anisotropy.

He plays Gaelic football with his local club Naomh Abán and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1999 to 2011. Playing career =Club= Lynch plays his club football with his local club called Naomh Abán in Ballyvourney. Lynch first came to prominence as a member of the club's underage teams. After the minor grade, he quickly joined the under-21 team. In 1995 Naomh Abán won their divisional championship and subsequently reached the final of the county under-21 championship. The opponents on that occasion were Mallow and a close game developed. At the full-time whistle the victory went to Mallow, as their ability to score goals clinched a 2–9 to 0–12 win. Lynch subsequently joined the Naomh Abán intermediate football team. In 1999 the club reached the final of the county intermediate championship, with Castletownbere providing the opposition. A close game developed between these two sides, however, at the full-time whistle the sides could not be separated and a draw was the result. The subsequent replay was also a close affair; however, it proved to be more conclusive. In the end victory went to Naomh Abán by 1–9 to 1–6 and Lynch collected a county intermediate championship winners' medal. =Inter-county= Lynch first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork senior football team in the late 1990s. He made his debut in the 1998–99 National Football League, a season which saw Cork reach the final of the competition. Dublin provided the opposition at Cork's home venue, Páirc Uí Chaoimh. A close game developed, however, Cork were never really troubled. A 0–12 to 1–7 score line resulted in victory for 'the Rebels', and gave Lynch a National League winners' medal in his debut season. Later that year he made his championship debut in the provincial series as Cork cruised to a Munster final showdown with arch-rivals Kerry. The men from 'the Kingdom' were on the hunt for a fourth successive provincial title, while Cork were out for success for the first time since 1995. Cork's victory on a score line of 2–10 to 2–4 was unexpected as Lynch claimed his very first Munster winners' medal. A subsequent defeat of Mayo saw Cork book their place in the All-Ireland final against Meath. The pressure was on the Cork footballers to secure a rare double, particularly since their hurling counterparts had won the All-Ireland title a fortnight previously. Ollie Murphy's first-half goal gave 'the Royals' a huge boost at half-time. Immediately after the interval Trevor Giles missed a penalty while Joe Kavanagh responded with a goal which gave Cork a brief lead. It was not enough as Lynch's side eventually lost the game by 1–11 to 1–8. In spite of this defeat Lynch was later rewarded with an All-Star award. After the highs of 1999, the following year proved disappointing as Cork exited the championship at a very early stage. In 2001 Cork were back and Lynch lined out in his second provincial decider. Reigning All-Ireland champions Kerry were the opponents. The game was a reasonably close affair; however, 'the Kingdom' never looked like losing. At the full-time whistle Cork were defeated by 0–19 to 1–13. 2001 was the first year of the qualifier system so, in spite of being defeated, Cork had another chance to battle for the All-Ireland title. Lynch's side, however, were subsequently dumped out of the championship by eventual champions Galway. 2002 proved to be a more successful year for Lynch. After defeating Kerry in the provincial semi-final, Cork qualified for a Munster final showdown with Tipperary. While many people expected Cork to win the game easily, Tipp nearly sneaked a win, however, the provincial decider ended in a draw. The replay was an absolute rout. Cork won by a huge score line of 1–23 to 0–7, giving Lynch a second Munster winners' medal. Cork's next game was the All-Ireland semi-final where they met Kerry for the third time in the championship that year. Furthermore, it was the first-ever meeting of these two great rivals in Croke Park. While expectations were high the game turned into a rout as everything went Kerry's way. Talismanic forward Colin Corkery was red-carded as 'the Rebels' were humiliated by 3–19 to 2–7. 2002 ended with the Cork hurling team going on strike. In turn, the football team joined in a sympathy strike. The players, who had been seeking better conditions, refused to play or train with the county again until the dispute with the county board was resolved. After a protracted standoff, the players' grievances were eventually settled. 2003 was a difficult year as Cork surrendered their provincial crown at an early stage before later crashing out of the championship in the All-Ireland qualifiers. In 2004 Lynch's side fared no better. After losing to Kerry in the Munster semi-final Cork were forced to manoeuvre through the All-Ireland qualifiers once again. An unconvincing victory over Clare was followed by a humiliating 0–18 to 0–12 defeat by Fermanagh and an end to Cork's championship ambitions. By 2005 the Cork footballers had regrouped and reached the Munster final for the first time in three years. Once again Kerry, the reigning All-Ireland champions, provided the opposition. The game was a close affair, however, Lynch's side were narrowly defeated by just 1–11 to 0–11. This did not mean the end of Cork's All-Ireland campaign. After winning their next two games 'the Rebels' qualified for an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kerry. In an embarrassing game of football for Cork, Lynch's side were trounced by thirteen points on a score line of 1–19 to 0–9. In 2006 Lynch's team reached the Munster final with Kerry lining out against them. That game ended in a 0–10 points apiece draw. The replay saw a much fresher Cork team surprisingly defeat Kerry by 1–12 to 0–9. James Masters proved the hero of the day, as he scored 1–7 of Cork's total. Lynch had secured a third Munster winners' medal. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi- final for the third time in five seasons. In a similar pattern to previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0–16 to 0–10 resulted in Cork being knocked out of the championship. In 2007 Cork were out to atone for their defeats by Kerry the previous year. Both sides met in the provincial decider for the third year in succession. Cork gave a good account of themselves, however, Kerry could not be beaten and Lynch's side went down on a 1–15 to 1–13 score line. Cork later did well in the All-Ireland series and finally qualified for the All-Ireland final after an eight-year absence. In a cruel twist of fate Kerry were the opponents and, in an even crueller twist, a late injury ruled Lynch out of a place on the starting fifteen. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. Lynch was sprung from the bench as a substitute, however, at the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. In 2008 Cork gained a modicum of revenge on Kerry when the sides met again in that year's Munster final. Kerry were cruising by eight points at the interval, however, Cork stormed back in the second-half. Kerry could only muster three points as Cork secured a remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. It was Lynch's fourth Munster winners' medal. Both sides met again in the All-Ireland semi-final, however, after a thrilling draw and a replay Kerry were the team that advanced to the championship decider. AT the start of 2009 Cork were earmarked as potential All-Ireland contenders. The team laid down their credentials at an early stage with a defeat of Monaghan to take the National League Division 2 title. After a subsequent defeat of Kerry in a replay of the Munster semi-final, Cork subsequently faced Limerick in the Munster final. Lynch was ruled out of that game through injury. Cork were the red-hot favourites going into the game, however, his loss on the field was felt as Limerick put Cork to the pin of their collars. After a slow start 'the Rebels' settled and eventually secured a narrow 2–6 to 0–11 victory. Lynch also missed Cork's subsequent All-Ireland quarter-final but looks set to return for a semi-final showdown with reigning champions Tyrone. In December 2011 Lynch retired from Inter-county football. =Inter-provincial= Lynch has also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games and has enjoyed some success. He first lined out with his province in 1999 when Munster qualified to play Connacht in the final. The game was a largely dull affair, with the southern province securing a 0–1 to 0–6 victory and a Railway Cup winners' medal for Lynch. It was the first of four consecutive call-ups to the Munster team, however, Lynch's province =International= Lynch has also been chosen for duty with the Ireland team in the International Rules Series against Australia. He first lined out for his country in the first test in 2002. Australia, however, narrowly won that game by 65 points to 58 points. The second test ended in a 42 points apiece draw. As a result of this Ireland lost by an aggregate score of 7 points. Lynch's football prowess earned him a place on the Ireland team again in 2003. A close series of games developed once again. Australia won the first test by 10 points; however, Ireland narrowed the margin of victory to just 3 points for the second test a week later. A 101–94 aggregate score line gave Australia a second consecutive International Rules title. After failing to make the squad in 2004, Lynch was included in the Ireland squad that travelled to Australia for the International Rules series the following year. It was a disappointing two-game series as Ireland were trounced in both tests. A 163–106 aggregate score line resulted in a defeat for Lynch's Ireland side.

It did not reach production status. Design and development The Mitsubishi Ki-83 was designed as a long range heavy fighter. It was designed and built by a team led by Tomio Kubo, designer of the highly successful Mitsubishi Ki-46. The design was a response to a 1943 specification for a new heavy fighter with great range. The first of four prototypes flew on 18 November 1944. The machines displayed remarkable maneuverability for aircraft of their size, being able to execute a 671 m (2,200 ft) diameter loop in just 31 seconds at a speed of over 644 km/h (400 mph). The Ki-83 carried a powerful armament of two 30 mm (1.18 in) and two 20 mm cannon in its nose. Despite the bomb-ravaged Japanese manufacturing sector, plans for the Ki-83 to enter production within were underway when Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945. Both the existence and performance of the Ki-83 were little known during the war, even in Japan. It was completely unknown in Allied military aviation circles – as demonstrated by the fact that the Ki-83 had not been given a reporting name. Most early photographs of the type were taken during the post-war occupation of Japan, when the four prototypes were seized by the United States Army Air Forces and repainted with USAAF insignia. When they were evaluated by U.S. aeronautical engineers and other experts, a Ki-83 using high-octane fuel reached a speed of 762 km/h (473 mph), at an altitude of 7,000 metres (23,000 ft).

It was sited where an old chapel stood. Supposedly he was spurred to this project due to his plundering of a chartreuse during a campaign in France. This was the first chartreuse in Castille and Leon. In 1403, a small adjacent palace was built under Rodrigo Alonso.

The hill is 12 miles south west of Gloucester and 3 miles east of Cinderford. The small village of Flaxley lies in the valley to the immediate north. Pope's Hill is said to have got its name from Mary Pope, who used to reside in Flaxley Abbey in the 18th century and walked over the hill as a young girl. She is buried in Flaxley churchyard. A principal road runs over the hill starting from the A4151 just east of Littledean and rejoins the A4151 further east at the Greyhound Inn. The A4151 runs along the southern flank of the hill. A steep section of road on the Flaxley side, Joey's Pitch, is notorious for being impassable in ice and snow. There are numerous other small roads and tracks linking the houses and smallholdings which are scattered across the hill. Rising to the west is Chestnuts Enclosure, an area of Forestry Commission woodland, and to the north, Welshbury Hill which has Iron Age workings. The Greyhound Inn was a popular pub beside the busy main road until its closure in 2016 following a robbery and subsequent fire. It was noted for its large concrete and plaster model dinosaur in the pub garden (known as \\"Horace\\") Built by local craftsman Bill Taylor whilst refurbishing the pub interior.

The length of the bridge is 1492 meters (4895 feet) and the road on the bridge is 7.3 meters (24 feet) wide. History The idea of constructing a bridge over the Brahmaputra was first mooted in 1910 and the thought gathered momentum during the Second World War. Initially there were doubts over the stability of the railway line between Bongaigaon and Amingaon following devastating floods in 1942-43. However, when the line had been satisfactorily stabilized, the Railway Minister announced the decision to construct the bridge in the Budget session of the Parliament in 1958. Re-construction after independence The bridge was built between 1959 and 1962 by Hindustan Construction Company at a cost of Rs 10.6 crore at that time.. The bridge was completed in September 1962 and the first engine rolled across it on 23 September 1962. The bridge is known to connect the Northeast India with rest of the country. The bridge is 40 feet above the normal flood level of the river which also ensure free navigation. The bridge was closed for a major repair work from March 23, 2019 and was opened for traffic on June 20, 2019.

At club level he played with Aghada and was an All-Ireland Championship-winner as a member of the extended panel with the Cork senior football team in 2010. After beginning his career at club level with Aghada, O'Connor joined the Cork under-21 team as a 19-year-old in 1999. He was promoted to the Cork senior team under Billy Morgan in 2004. From his debut, O'Connor became a regular in defence and made a total of 25 championship appearances in a career that ended with him leaving the panel in March 2011. During that time he was a panellist when Cork won the All-Ireland Championship in 2010. O'Connor also secured three Munster Championship medals on the field of play and back-to-back National Football League medals in two separate divisions. Playing career =Agahda= O'Connor joined the Aghada club at a young age and played in all grade at juvenile and underage levels as a dual player. He made his first appearance for the Aghada senior football team on 18 May 1997 when he lined out at right corner-back in a 5-05 to 4-07 defeat by Mallow in the 1997 Cork County Championship. O'Connor also hurled with the Aghada intermediate team, and lined out in defence when the club lost the 2005 PIHC final to Ballinhassig. =Cork= Under-21 O'Connor first played for Cork as a 19-year-old when he was drafted onto the under-21 team for the 1999 Munster Under-21 Championship. He made his debut on 31 March 1999 when he lined out at left corner-back in a 4–12 to 1–07 defeat of Tipperary. He was again named in the same position for Cork's subsequent defeat by Kerry in the Munster final. O'Connor was again eligible for the under-21 team the following year, but ended his underage inter-county county career without silverware. Senior O'Connor joined the Cork senior team under Billy Morgan, and made his first appearance on 17 July 2004 when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Owen Sexton in an 0–18 to 0–11 defeat by Fermanagh in the All- Ireland Qualifiers. He was again included on the panel for the following season and was introduced as a substitute in all but one of Cork's championship games, including the 1–11 to 0–11 Munster final defeat by Kerry. He broke onto the starting fifteen during the 2006 Munster Championship and claimed his first Munster Championship medal that season after lining out at left corner-back in Cork's 1–12 to 0–09 victory over Kerry in a final replay. After suffering a two-point defeat by Kerry in his third successive Munster final appearance in 2007, O'Connor was again selected at left corner-back when Cork faced Kerry in the 2007 All-Ireland final. Marking Colm Cooper, he ended the game on the losing side after a 3–13 to 1–09 defeat. After starting Cork's opening game of 2008 Munster Championship on the bench, O'Connor was reinstated to left corner-back for the final and claimed a second winners' medal after the 1–16 to 1–11 victory over Kerry. After claiming the Division 2 title of the 2009 National League after a defeat of Monaghan in the final, he later won a third Munster Championship medal in five seasons after Cork's 2–06 to 0–11 win over Limerick. Cork subsequently qualified for an All-Ireland final-meeting with Kerry, with O'Connor named on the bench. He was a late addition to the match-day starting fifteen as a replacement for Ray Carey, in a match which Cork lost by 0–16 to 1–09. O'Connor was an unused substitute when Cork defeated Mayo to claim the Division 1 title of the 2010 National League and later remained as a panelist rather than a member of the starting fifteen during Cork's championship campaign. On 19 September 2010, he claimed a winners' medal as an unused substitute when Cork defeated Down by 0–16 to 0–15 in the All-Ireland final. He rejoined the Cork senior team at the start of the 2011 season, however, injury curtailed his game time. On 28 March 2011, it was reported that he had opted out of the panel, effectively retiring from the inter-county game. =Munster= O'Connor was first selected for the Munster inter-provincial team in advance of the 2005 Railway Cup. It was the first of three successive seasons with the team, with defeat at the semi-final stage in the first two seasons. O'Connor lined out at left corner-back when Munster suffered a 1–12 to 1–08 defeat by Ulster in the 2007 Railway Cup final. Illness and death O'Connor was first struck with illness when a rare type of bone cancer called Ewing’s sarcoma was discovered in October 2017. The diagnosis stemmed from a throbbing pain in his right ankle, which he mistook as the long-term effects of his football career. Four months of aggressive chemotherapy followed in an effort to shrink the tumour enough so that surgeons could proceed with an operation in February 2018. Intensive chemotherapy resumed after a month and went on until the end of July 2018. O'Connor had planned on returning to work in December 2018; however, he was suffering from persistent pains in his leg and the wound was not healing fully. In January 2019 he had another serious operation and his lower leg was amputated. While trying to recover from the amputation, he started experiencing bad back pains, only later to find out that his cancer had spread and further chemotherapy was required. A GoFundMe page, set up by Friends of Kieran, raised over €270,000 in just four days after being set up in March 2019, while the wider GAA community also contributed funds through challenge matches, bucket collections and other sponsored activities. On 15 July 2020, O'Connor died at age 41. Survived by his wife and three children, he was the first member of Cork's 2010 All-Ireland Championship-winning team to die. There were numerous tributes from O'Connor's former teammates, including Conor Counihan and Eoin Cadogan, the Cork County Board and the GAA president John Horan, as well as people from the world of politics and other sports, such as Davy Russell.

Born in Kilnamartyra, County Cork, O Leary arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team, before later joining the under-21 and junior sides. He made his debut in the 2000 National Football League. O'Leary went on to play a key part for over a decade, and won one All-Ireland medal, three Munster medals and four National Football League medals(1 division 2). He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. O'Leary represented the Munster inter-provincial team on one occasion, when he captained the team in an unsuccessful campaign. At club level he plays with Cill na Martra. Throughout his career, O'Leary made 42 championship appearances for Cork. He announced his retirement from inter-county football on 17 October 2013. Playing career =Club= O'Leary plays his local club football with his local club in Cill na Martra and has enjoyed some success. In 1999 he won a Cork Minor C Football Championship with the club. In 2002 O'Leary enjoyed his first major success with Cill na Martra when he captured a divisional junior football championship winners' medal following a 2–10 to 1–9 victory over Grenagh. 2003 saw Cill na Martra reach the divisional final for the second year in succession. Ballingeary provided the opposition, however, their near neighbours could not match Cill na Martra's skill. A 0–12 to 1–7 score line gave O'Leary a second divisional winners' medal. Cill na Martra later represented their division in the county junior championship. They reached the final that year and lined out against Carbery Rangers. A 0–10 to 0–5 score line resulted in defeat for O'Leary's side. =Minor and under-21= O'Leary first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork under-16 team. He won a Munster title in this grade before going on to enjoy much more success with the Cork footballers at more advanced grades. By 1999 O'Leary had joined the Cork minor football team, playing corner back for the entire campaign. Because of this he collected his first Munster minor winners' medal. Cork trounced Kerry by 2–16 to 1–9 on that occasion, however, 'the Rebels' were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi-final. In 2000 O'Leary secured a place in the half-back line on the Cork minor football team and Cork qualified for a second consecutive Munster decider. That year he won his first provincial winners' medal on the field of play following a 1–13 ro 0–14 defeat of arch-rivals Kerry. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final, with Mayo providing the opposition. A close game followed, however, at the full-time whistle Cork were the champions by 2–12 to 0–13. The win gave O'Leary an All-Ireland minor winners' medal in his last appearance for Cork in that grade. By 2001 O'Leary was an automatic choice for the Cork under-21 team. That year he won a Munster title in that grade following a 1–12 to 0–8 defeat of Limerick. Cork were subsequently defeated in the All-Ireland semi- final. O'Leary enjoyed no further success with the county under-21 footballers. =Junior= In 2001, he won Munster and All Ireland Championship medals with the Cork Junior team. =Senior= He first joined the Cork senior team during the 2000/01 National Football League. In 2003 O'Leary made his senior championship debut for Cork. 'The Rebels' were trounced by Limerick on that occasion. The year went from bad to worse as Cork crashed out of the championship in the All-Ireland qualifiers. In 2004 O'Leary's side fared no better. After losing to Kerry in the Munster semi-final Cork had to manoeuvre through the qualifiers again. He subsequently played no part due to injury for the remainder of the championship in an unconvincing victory over Clare which was followed by a humiliating 0–18 to 0–12 defeat by Fermanagh. By 2005 the Cork footballers had regrouped and reached the Munster final for the first time in three years. Once again Kerry, the reigning All-Ireland champions, provided the opposition. The game was a close affair, however, O'Leary's side were narrowly defeated by just 1–11 to 0–11. This did not mean the end of Cork's All-Ireland ambitions. After winning their next two games 'the Rebels' qualified for an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kerry. In an embarrassing game of football for Cork, O'Leary's side were trounced by thirteen points on a score line of 1–19 to 0–9. In 2006 O'Leary played no part in the team's 1–12 to 0–9 defeat of Kerry in the Munster final. The quirks of the championship saw Cork face Kerry again in the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final for the third time in five seasons. O'Leary played in that game, however, in a similar pattern to previous encounters Cork failed to beat Kerry at Croke Park. A 0–16 to 0–10 score line resulted in Cork being knocked out of the championship. In 2007 Cork were out to atone for their defeats by Kerry the previous year. Both sides met in the provincial decider for the third year in succession. Cork gave a good account of themselves, however, Kerry could not be beaten and O'Leary's side went down on a 1–15 to 1–13 score line. Cork later did well in the subsequent All-Ireland series and finally qualified for the All-Ireland final after an eight-year absence. There was some doubt over O'Leary's participation in the game as he had been caught on television cameras striking Graham Geraghty in the All-Ireland semi-final against Meath. In the end he was cleared to play, however, in a cruel twist Kerry were the opponents. While the first half was played on an even keel, 'the Kingdom' ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued. Goalkeeper Alan Quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals. At the full-time whistle Cork were trounced by 3–13 to 1–9. In 2008 Cork gained a modicum of revenge on Kerry when the sides met again in that year's Munster final. O'Leary, however, played no part due to injury in the remarkable 1–16 to 1–11 victory. Both sides met again in the All-Ireland semi-final with OLeary at wing back, however, after a thrilling draw and a replay Kerry were the team that advanced to the championship decider. In 2009 Cork were earmarked as potential All-Ireland contenders. After drawing with Kerry in the provincial semi-final the replay proved much more conclusive and ended in a victory for 'the Rebels'. The game was not without incident as O'Leary was sent to the line for blowing Paul Galvin to the ground with a beautiful right hook. The Kerry player was also red-carded for starting the episode. Because of this O'Leary missed Cork's subsequent Munster final triumph over Limerick. On 17 October 2013 O'Leary announced his retirement from Inter-County Football.

By next day, Shaobo (邵伯), the important town in the south had fallen into communist hands in the Battle of Shaobo. The communist control of Shaobo (邵伯) ensured the escape route of the defenders of Gaoyou was severed, and a line of communist defense against possible nationalist reinforcement to Gaoyou from Yangzhou and Taizhou, Jiangsu had formed along the Shaobo (邵伯) – Dinggou (丁沟) regions, manned by the communist 7th Column which took the town of Shaobo (邵伯). By December 21, 1945, the communist 8th Column had taken all nationalist strongholds outside the city wall, and launched heavy political propaganda offensives against the defenders of Gaoyou while making the preparation to take the city at the same time. In the evening of December 25, 1945, communist attackers launched their assault on the city in the heavy rain from three directions: northwest, east and south. The attackers succeeded in driving the defenders from the city wall after climbing the walls with ladders, and as the main force of the communist 8th Column fought their way into the city, the defenders were completely annihilated. By the early morning of December 26, 1945, the Japanese brigade headquarter in the city was taken and the remaining defenders consisted of mostly Japanese troops ceased their resistance and surrendered. In the meantime, the communist 7th Column also had successfully driven back the nationalist reinforcement from Yangzhou. The nationalist forces were not very enthusiastic about reinforcing their former enemy at Gaoyou, and those from Yangzhou did not put too much fight and withdrew back to Yangzhou soon, while those nationalist troops from Taizhou, Jiangsu did not even bother to send out anyone to reinforce Gaoyou. Nonetheless, the nationalists had suffered a great debacle in winning popular support from local populace for attempting to reinforce their former enemy, the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime force. The communists, on the other hands, not only achieved a great popularity victory, but also succeeded in capturing more than 80 artillery pieces, over 6,000 firearms, and inflicted over 1,100 casualties on the Japanese, plus another 4,000+ casualties on the Japanese puppet regime force.

The battle was part of the Chinese Civil War, resulting in a victory for the People's Liberation Army. Prelude Like similar clashes between the communists and nationalists in the aftermath of World War II in China, the battle was partly due to the realisation by Kuomintang (nationalist) leader Chiang Kai-shek that his regime had neither sufficient troops or transportation to allow him to deploy in the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Since the communists (who dominated most rural areas of the country) could expand their territory by accepting the Japanese surrender, Chiang ordered the Japanese (and the Chinese puppet regime) not to surrender to the communists. This would maintain order in the Japanese-controlled regions and help fight off the communists until the arrival and deployment of Kuomintang troops. As a result of this order, most members of the Japanese military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these forces were not from Chiang's own circle. They were primarily warlord troops only nominally under Chiang's command before the war; they were Kuomintang in name only, and maintained much of their autonomous status. These warlords were primarily interested in maintaining their own power, and defected to the Japanese when Japan offered to let them retain their power in exchange for collaboration. After World War II ended, these forces returned to the Kuomintang for the same reason they had defected. For Chiang, it was difficult to sever his relationship with the warlords; this would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and the warlords were still useful to him. Chiang's objectives, therefore, were to solve the problems of the warlords and the communists; by the end of the civil war, this proved impossible. Nationalist strategy Even if the communists were able to take control of the Japanese-occupied territories, this would still be beneficial to Chiang. The communists were strong enough to greatly reduce the strength of the warlords; at the same time the communists would be weakened by the fighting, making it easier for the Kuomintang to prevail. The warlords gladly followed Chiang's orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. They were aware that, due to their collaboration with the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were hated by the general Chinese population (including those nationalists who had refused to surrender to, or stop fighting, the Japanese). The order from Chiang not to surrender, and to fight the communists, was a lifeline for them. Communist strategy The communist strategy was simpler than that employed by the Kuomintang, since there were no large divisions within the communist ranks. They had already earned considerable popular support as the only Chinese force left in the region actively fighting the Japanese (and their puppet regime) after the withdrawal of the nationalists. After successfully establishing communist bases in rural areas, life there was better for the general population than it was in regions held by the Japanese. Order of battle =Nationalists= *Two battalions of the Fourth Division *One battalion of the county self-defense regiment *One regiment and one battalion of the Second Division =Communists= *Seventh Column of the New Fourth Army *Nineteenth Brigade *One independent regiment Battle On August 16, 1945, the communists decided to take Yongjiazhen, in eastern Anhui, by force after two battalions of the Fourth Nationalist Division and their Japanese allies refused to surrender. The 55th and 56th Regiments of the communist 19th Brigade, assisted by the Seventh Column, launched their assault on the town at dawn; by dusk, the town was under communist control. The nationalist and Japanese defenders suffered over 900 casualties, and the communists captured three machine guns, one 60mm mortar and over 100 firearms. A few days later, on August 19, the 19th Brigade (assisted by a communist independent regiment) launched an assault on Yuncao in Hanshan County (west of Yongjiazhen), which was guarded by a regiment and battalion of the nationalist Second Division. The brigade took the town, after defeating its defenders and nationalist reinforcements. This battle caused over 1300 nationalist and 21 Japanese fatalities. Ninety-eight nationalist troops and twenty-one Japanese troops were captured by the communists (who also seized three artillery pieces, six heavy machine guns, over twenty light machine guns and over 700 rifles). Outcome Like similar clashes immediately after World War II between the communists and the Kuomintang, this conflict demonstrated that Chiang's attempts to simultaneously solve the warlord and communist problems was an impossible task. Although the power of the warlords was weakened as their forces were defeated by the communists, any gains for the nationalists were negated by political fallout from their alliance with the Japanese.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era, and resulted in communist victory. This campaign was part of the General Counteroffensive in Shanxi-Chahar (province)-Hebei. Campaign In September, 1945, the communist decided to take Wei (蔚) County and Warm Spring (Nuanquan 暖泉) in Chahar (province) and Guanling (广灵) in Shanxi by force after the local defenders consisted of former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II refused to surrender. The 12th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Column was tasked with this job, and its 34th Regiment would take Warm Spring (Nuanquan 暖泉) of Chahar (province), its 35th Regiment would take Wei (蔚) County of Chahar (province) with the help of a battalion of its 36th Regiment, and the remaining two battalions would take Guanling (广灵) of Shanxi. At the dusk of September 29, 1945, all communist units suddenly besieged their targets and surprised the defenders. The 34th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Column launched its assault against its target at dusk and annihilated most of the defenders in the fierce street fights. The surviving defenders were annihilated in the ambush as they attempted to escape. On September 30, 1945, the 36th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Column took the important position of Four Passes (Siguan, 四关) of Guanling (广灵) in Shanxi, but their subsequent attacks on the town itself via ladders were beaten back by the defenders on October 6, 1945. The communists changed their tactic by digging tunnels and the 34th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Column was redeployed to reinforce their comrades on October 26, 1945. At 10:00 PM on October 26, 1945, the general assault on the town begun and after three hours of fierce fight, the entire garrison of defenders was completely annihilated. Meanwhile, the attack on Wei (蔚) County in Chahar (province) by the 35th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Column was successfully beaten back on October 1, 1945. The 34th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Column was redeployed to attack Wei (蔚) County in Chahar (province) but its attack was also successfully beaten back by the defenders on October 6, 1945. Communists responded by adding an artillery company to the attacking force and on November 2, 1945, they finally succeeded in breaching the defense at the western gate and southern gate. After five hours of fierce street fight, the defenders were annihilated, with only around 30 were able to escape the onslaught. The communist victory of this campaign resulted in inflicting over 3,000 casualties over their enemy, capturing more than 40 machine guns and over 1,000 firearms.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Battle In October 1945, the communists decided to take Time Village (Shicun, 时村) of Xiu (宿) County in Anhui by force after the local defenders consisted of former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II refused to surrender. However, the defenders consisted of a division that was able to successfully fend off the initial communist attacks by relying on their strong fortifications. The communists changed their tactic and the 34th Regiment of the 12th Brigade of the 4th Division of the communist New Fourth Army launched its attack on the village at night, breaching the defense. After fierce street battle, the defenders fled and the village fell into communist hands. The communists inflicted over 2,000 casualties on the defenders, including capturing the nationalist commander Hu Zepu (胡泽普) alive, and they also captured over 1,000 firearms. The attacking communists suffered over 200 casualties. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek’s secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist government.

Life Aumonier was born in Northwood, Middlesex (now northwest London); his family name is Huguenot (French Protestant). Eric's grandfather, William, founded the Aumonier Studios in 1876, an architectural sculpture firm in London, initially located at New Inn Yard off Tottenham Court Road, then at 84 Charlotte Street. His son, also called William, continued the firm into the 1930s. William (junior) studied at the West London School of Art. He exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in 1899–1900 and was responsible for the architectural decorations of the Victoria Law Courts, Birmingham, in the late 1880s. Two of his sons, Whitworth and Eric himself, were sculptors. Eric studied at the Slade School of Art. By 1931, Eric and Whitworth were running the studio as W. Aumonier & Sons, with Eric responsible for artistic output. In 1929, Aumonier was commissioned with five othersThe others sculptors of winds were: Eric Gill, Henry Moore, Allan G. Wyon, A. H. Gerard and Samuel Rabinovitch. Jacob Epstein was also commissioned to carve sculptures of Day and Night. to carve one of a set of relief sculptures of the four winds for 55 Broadway, the new Underground Electric Railways Company of London headquarters in St. James's, London, designed by Charles Holden. Aumonier carved the South Wind on the west side of the North wing (not visible from ground level). In 1932, Aumonier designed two Art Deco relief sculptures in the foyer of the Daily Express Building in London. He also designed a young horse, in white porcelain, for Royal Worcester. {align=center \\"Britain\\" Panel from the Daily Express building foyer  \\"Empire\\" Panel from the Daily Express building foyer } Another commission for London Underground, The Archer at East Finchley Underground station, is his most iconic work, the only three-dimensional statue on the system. The contract for the work was placed on 8 June 1939, with an estimated cost of £245. The architect for the station was once again Charles Holden. The sculpture was unveiled on 22 July 1940. Pennyfare, London Transport's staff journal, explained the roots of the image in July 1940: :\\"the figure of an ancient hunter of wild game is placed high up on the new East Finchley station. It is more than a decorative device – it is powerful symbolism\\". Finchley was on the edge of the royal forest of Enfield, which was hunted by both court and commoner. Drivers on the Northern line still bear a tie pin based on the sculpture. The Archer is nearly twice natural size and was made of six hundredweight of beech timber round a steel armature and then covered with 5 hundredweight of sheet lead. The timber had come from Czechoslovakia. The gold for the gilded features was mined in South Africa and the bow was English ash, bent by steam and coated with copper and gilt. The sculpture was probably constructed in three main sections, which were re- assembled on site. Amongst other work for London Underground, Aumonier also made two stone reliefs over two of the entrances to the canteen at London Underground's Acton Works – one of a pie, knife and fork. A sculpture of Dick Whittington was planned for Highgate, but a reduction in the scope of the new station buildings caused by World War II meant this was never commissioned. Aumonier worked on the new City Hall in Norwich with Alfred Hardiman and James Woodford. The sculptor also did some set work in the cinema. In 1946 he worked on the Powell and Pressburger film A Matter of Life and Death at Denham Film Studios. On the giant moving stairway featured in the film, Aumonier created the statues of various famous people. By coincidence, Powell and Pressburger's production company was called The Archers. In later years, Aumonier and his wife moved to Ashburton, New Zealand, where he died in 1974. References *McGill, Ann. The Aumoniers, Craftsmen and Artists New York : Highland Books.

While Embry was trying to start a bus company in Cincinnati he met early aviator John Paul Riddle, who had landed at the local polo field. Riddle offered him a plane ride, and from then on Embry was hooked on aviation. After parting ways with Riddle in 1939, he moved to California in 1941. Five years later, in 1946, Embry died of a heart attack. Embry-Riddle Two years after meeting, T. Higbee Embry and friend, John Paul Riddle, formed the Embry-Riddle Company on December 17, 1925 at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. The company was financed by Embry and he served as company president, and the two began to sell Waco Aircraft. In the spring of 1926, the Embry-Riddle Company opened the Embry-Riddle Flying School. The Embry-Riddle Company was merged with the Aviation Corporation (AVCO) of Delaware in 1929. AVCO phased out the Embry- Riddle Flying School in the fall of 1930. Shortly after, AVCO became American Airways (the predecessor of American Airlines), and the Embry-Riddle Company was gone. Embry was contacted by Riddle in 1939, as he was ready to get back into the business of training pilots. Embry had no interest in reentering a partnership with Riddle, so Riddle found a partner in John G. McKay and his wife Isabel.

It is a generalization to associative algebras of the notion of a separable field extension.  Definition and First Properties  A ring homomorphism (of unital, but not necessarily commutative rings) :K \\\\to A is called separable (or a separable extension) if the multiplication map :\\\\mu : A \\\\otimes_K A \\\\to A, a \\\\otimes b \\\\mapsto ab admits a section :\\\\sigma: A \\\\to A \\\\otimes_K A by means of a homomorphism σ of A-A-bimodules. Such a section σ is determined by its value :p := \\\\sigma(1) = \\\\sum a_i \\\\otimes b_i σ(1). The condition that σ is a section of μ is equivalent to :\\\\sum a_i b_i = 1 and the condition to be an homomorphism of A-A-bimodules is equivalent to the following requirement for any a in A: :\\\\sum a a_i \\\\otimes b_i = \\\\sum a_i \\\\otimes b_i a. Such an element p is called a separability idempotent, since it satisfies p^2 = p. Examples For any commutative ring R, the (non-commutative) ring of n-by-n matrices M_n(R) is a separable R-algebra. For any 1 \\\\le j \\\\le n, a separability idempotent is given by \\\\sum_{i=1}^n e_{ij} \\\\otimes e_{ji}, where e_{ij} denotes the elementary matrix which is 0 except for the entry in position (i, j), which is 1. In particular, this shows that separability idempotents need not be unique. =Separable algebras over a field= If \\\\scriptstyle L/K is a field extension, then L is separable as an associative K-algebra if and only if the extension of fields is separable. If L/K has a primitive element a with irreducible polynomial p(x) = (x - a) \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i x^i, then a separability idempotent is given by \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a^i \\\\otimes_K \\\\frac{b_i}{p'(a)}. The tensorands are dual bases for the trace map: if \\\\sigma_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{n} are the distinct K-monomorphisms of L into an algebraic closure of K, the trace mapping Tr of L into K is defined by Tr(x) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_i(x). The trace map and its dual bases make explicit L as a Frobenius algebra over K. More generally, separable algebras over a field K can be classified as follows: they are the same as finite products of matrix algebras over finite-dimensional division algebras whose centers are finite-dimensional separable field extensions of the field K. In particular: Every separable algebra is itself finite- dimensional. If K is a perfect field --- for example a field of characteristic zero, or a finite field, or an algebraically closed field --- then every extension of K is separable so that separable K-algebras are finite products of matrix algebras over finite-dimensional division algebras over field K. In other words, if K is a perfect field, there is no difference between a separable algebra over K and a finite-dimensional semisimple algebra over K. It can be shown by a generalized theorem of Maschke that an associative K-algebra A is separable if for every field extension \\\\scriptstyle L/K the algebra \\\\scriptstyle A\\\\otimes_K L is semisimple. =Group rings= If K is commutative ring and G is a finite group such that the order of G is invertible in K, then the group ring K[G] is a separable K-algebra. A separability idempotent is given by \\\\frac{1}{o(G)} \\\\sum_{g \\\\in G} g \\\\otimes g^{-1}. Equivalent characterizations of separability There are several equivalent definitions of separable algebras. A K-algebra A is separable if and only if it is projective when considered as a left module of A^e in the usual way. Moreover, an algebra A is separable if and only if it is flat when considered as a right module of A^e in the usual way. Separable extensions can also be characterized by means of split extensions: A is separable over K if all short exact sequences of A-A-bimodules that are split as A-K-bimodules also split as A-A-bimodules. Indeed, this condition is necessary since the multiplication mapping \\\\mu : A \\\\otimes_K A \\\\rightarrow A arising in the definition above is a A-A-bimodule epimorphism, which is split as an A-K- bimodule map by the right inverse mapping A \\\\rightarrow A \\\\otimes_K A given by a \\\\mapsto a \\\\otimes 1 . The converse can be proven by a judicious use of the separability idempotent (similarly to the proof of Maschke's theorem, applying its components within and without the splitting maps). Equivalently, the relative Hochschild cohomology groups H^n(R,S;M) of (R,S) in any coefficient bimodule M is zero for n > 0. Examples of separable extensions are many including first separable algebras where R = separable algebra and S = 1 times the ground field. Any ring R with elements a and b satisfying ab = 1, but ba different from 1, is a separable extension over the subring S generated by 1 and bRa. Relation to Frobenius algebras A separable algebra is said to be strongly separable if there exists a separability idempotent that is symmetric, meaning : e = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\otimes y_i = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\\\otimes x_i An algebra is strongly separable if and only if its trace form is nondegenerate, thus making the algebra into a particular kind of Frobenius algebra called a symmetric algebra (not to be confused with the symmetric algebra arising as the quotient of the tensor algebra). If K is commutative, A is a finitely generated projective separable K-module, then A is a symmetric Frobenius algebra.. If A is commutative, the proof is simpler, see Relation to formally unramified and formally étale extensions Any separable extension A / K of commutative rings is formally unramified. The converse holds if A is a finitely generated K-algebra. A separable flat (commutative) K-algebra A is formally étale. Further results A theorem in the area is that of J. Cuadra that a separable Hopf-Galois extension R  S has finitely generated natural S-module R. A fundamental fact about a separable extension R  S is that it is left or right semisimple extension: a short exact sequence of left or right R-modules that is split as S-modules, is split as R-modules. In terms of G. Hochschild's relative homological algebra, one says that all R-modules are relative (R,S)-projective. Usually relative properties of subrings or ring extensions, such as the notion of separable extension, serve to promote theorems that say that the over-ring shares a property of the subring. For example, a separable extension R of a semisimple algebra S has R semisimple, which follows from the preceding discussion. There is the celebrated Jans theorem that a finite group algebra A over a field of characteristic p is of finite representation type if and only if its Sylow p-subgroup is cyclic: the clearest proof is to note this fact for p-groups, then note that the group algebra is a separable extension of its Sylow p-subgroup algebra B as the index is coprime to the characteristic. The separability condition above will imply every finitely generated A-module M is isomorphic to a direct summand in its restricted, induced module. But if B has finite representation type, the restricted module is uniquely a direct sum of multiples of finitely many indecomposables, which induce to a finite number of constituent indecomposable modules of which M is a direct sum. Hence A is of finite representation type if B is. The converse is proven by a similar argument noting that every subgroup algebra B is a B-bimodule direct summand of a group algebra A.

ABOUT STILLHOUSE HOLLOW FALLS STATE NATURAL AREA =Overview= Contemplating about the Stillhouse Hollow Falls State Natural Area, it is a natural area being located in Summertown, Maury County, Tennessee. It is a state in the south-eastern United States and holds thirty sixth position in terms of areas and sixteenth position in relation with the population among its fifty states. Further, it is surrounded by eight states including Kentucky in the north side, Arkansas in the west, Missouri in the northwest direction, Virginia in the northeast and finally, North Carolina to the east direction. In addition to this, the eastern side of the states is being dominated by the Appalachian Mountains and the western border of Tennessee is being formed by the very popular Mississippi River. Moreover, the capital city of the state is Nashville which is being regarded as one of its major cities comprising a population of around 670,820 in the year 2019(Molloy, 2019). However, the second largest city of Tennessee is Memphis which also had a population of 651,073 in the same year. There are many attractions and beautiful places that can be visited by the visitors in this state and one of the most visited and loved places is Stillhouse Hollow Falls. It is one of the pleasant and beautiful places to be visited by the nature lovers and those who desire a nature fix. One of the major features of this area is Hollow Falls which is a seventy five foot and approximately twenty three meters waterfall. Additionally, it is located roughly two-thirds of a mile from the point of entry. The effusive waterfalls pools into flawlessly placid swimming holes underneath. Other than this, the waterfalls also flow towards the floor of the forest in a natural, attractive and lovely scene. The inhabitants residing in the nearby areas love to visit this place and feel calmness in such magnificent waterfalls. Furthermore, the Stillhouse Hollow Falls State Natural Area was developed by Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation (TPGF) and after sometime it was sold to the state of Tennessee. In the year 2006 in the month of June, the area was elected as a natural area underneath the Natural Areas Preservation Act of 1971. This natural area is positioned approximately seventy miles from Nashville, Tennessee and is quite famous for bird watchers, hikers as well as rock climbers (Foster, 2011). Moreover, most of the hikers are being motivated to take the Stillhouse Hollow Falls trail which helps the visitors to visit the popular waterfall to just 2/3 of a mile. Even the trails of the falls are lined with all kinds of plants, spices, flora and multi-coloured exhibitions of wallflowers. =Directions= In order to reach Stillhouse Hollow Falls, the travellers or visitors have to take I-65 south from Nashville and after that, need to take the Saturn Parkway in the direction of Columbia. On highway number 43, it is advisable to take right and go further approximately 21 miles. The parking area or place of the natural area is one the right side as soon as visitors pass over the Judge Workman Bridge. In consequence, the Stillhouse Hollow Falls is near about 3 miles in the northeast direction of Summertown on highway number 43 on the left side just beside the bridge. =Wonderful winter waterfalls= Stillhouse Hollow Falls in Tennessee are generally more beautiful and breath-taking in the winter season. Sometimes, the view is spectacular. In the leafless season when most of the plants, flowers and trees are not thwacking up and are also not storing the water from the rains, more water runoff in the streams and this is quite pleasant to watch. Therefore, streams in this area run more reliably and steadily and make the hollow waterfalls a decent picturesque destination in the season which is generally cooler. Even sometimes the winter season also has good probabilities of rain events and this can bring on the issues related to flooding which might prove to be dangerous (Smith & Campbell, 2017). Therefore, proper caution and carefulness is required while travelling and visiting there. Nevertheless, after the rainy season, there is a good time to visit Stillhouse Hollow Falls. During the winter season, the water in the natural area diminishes greatly and the spectator can enjoy the magnificent views. Furthermore, when the temperature in the area is below the freezing point, the waterfalls become a solid formation of ice. During this time, the hollow waterfalls seem to be very wonderful and visitors can get an opportunity to see the fall in its frozen splendour. However, when the temperature becomes warmer, icicles of waterfalls start melting and sometimes they even fall. This might prove very unsafe and perilous time for the visitors to visit there. =Stillhouse Hollow Falls Sign= Since, Stillhouse Hollow Falls is protected under the Natural Areas Preservation Act, there are many rules and regulations which are being enforced. For any criminal act, there is a penalty of $100 per day and maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per day. Other than this, the area is required to be visited only during the day time and deem to be closed at dusk. For the hikers, it is obligatory to stay on the trails and off trail hiking is a publishable act as per the law. Moreover, it is important for the travellers and visitors to make sure that they do not pluck flowers and must leave them as it is for the pleasure of others (Smith & Campbell, 2017). Thus, collecting and plucking off any plant and flower is prohibited in the area. Additionally, any kind of alcohol is not allowed in Stillhouse Hollow Falls and even in the parking lot. Last but not the least, it is mandatory for the visitors to pack out their trash and mist avoid any kind of litter. HISTORY Speaking in relation with the history related to Stillhouse Hollow Falls, it was elected as a natural area of the state in the year 2006. It was acquired by the foundation known as Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation (TPGF) in the same year for $130,000 (corresponding to $164,871 in 2019). Moreover, it is also protected permanently under the NAPA (Natural Areas Preservation Act) of 1971. The natural area is further being sold to the State of Tennessee for $97,500 (corresponding to $123,653 in 2019).In the year 1796; Tennessee became the sixteenth state of the union. Additionally, the state is only 112 miles wide however springs around 432 miles from the Appalachian Mountains boundary with North Carolina in the east direction to popular rivers in the west (Llewellin&Molloy;, 2016).TPGF is nothing but a non-profit organization related to land which is founded in the year 1998 for the purpose of protecting the natural as well as scenic land in Tennessee. In addition to this, it is also recognized as the LTAC (Land Trust Accreditation Commission) by the Land Trust Alliance. Furthermore, this foundation is also reinforced by the donations from the members, charity from individuals along with some gifts from the land of private property-owners. Thus, in regard with Stillhouse Hollow waterfalls, the main mission of the foundation is to preserve this natural area and monuments like waterfalls, caves and cliffs (Tennessee Valley Authority, 1938). Preservation of this area will help in creating moderately small reserves which are not ecologically sustainable in separation, therefore the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation also intends to develop passages of conserved land in order to associate these characteristics as well as superior reserves, for example state parks & national parks which are also known as greenways. Subsequent to this, the TPGF also offered a track development to the friends of Maury County Parks Along with the Tennessee Trails Association which assisted the inaugural of the natural zone to the community in the month of June in the year 2006. The allowance money was utilized for developing the parking area which is quite small, for offering signage, building the kiosk and lastly, for developing the tracks. AREA & GEOGRAPHY Articulating about the area of Stillhouse Hollow Falls, it is a 90 acre state natural area which is situated nearly twenty one miles southwest of Columbia and around 3 miles of Summertown off Hwy US 43 in Maury County, Tennessee. In addition to this, this waterfall is on the Western Highland Rim in the turning point of the river Duck. Further, the Stillhouse Hollow Falls got its name from its major noteworthy characteristic i.e. Hollows waterfall which can be viewed through taking a walk of around two/third of a mile sideways to the track of Stillhouse Hollow Falls. Additionally, the track also passes by an unidentified stream that formulates a trivial picturesque flow prior falling almost seventy five feet over the falls (Molloy, 2019). Because of this fall, a deep hollow is being created beneath the falls which is being enclosed through sheer gradients wherein there is an emergence of wet-weather springs making a contribution to an amusing environment assisting a multi- coloured spring wild plant exhibition of trillium, wild geranium, spiderwort, phlox as well as numerous supplementary classes. Underpinning this, the parking area of the Stillhouse Hollow Falls is nearby three miles north of Summertown. The point of entry of the waterfalls is a rock-strew road having a sheer hike into a grit parking lot which can house almost ten to fifteen cars. This signifies that the parking is very limited in this state natural area. Pertaining to this, the folks and visitors park their vehicles on non- designated zones in order to step-in in the location. In regards with the geology of this particular area, it formulates a picturesque natural topography like horizontal shale-bottom watercourses, percolates, small and big waterfalls which supports in shaping the dismembered landscape of the region. Consequently, it can be well-attributed that the Stillhouse Hollow Falls which is spread approximately in a 90-acre area is considered as a gem in Maury County which is quite stunning and family friendly as well. Talking about the track, it is being regarded as moderate and is quite good for people falling in the entire age category (Stillhouse Hollow Falls State Natural Area, 2020). In total, it is around one/two miles and almost all the people make use of it as countryside excursions, walking and hiking. Even the dogs and other pets are permitted on the state natural area track; however they must be retained on a chain or string. FLORA & FAUNA The very starting of the track passes by an attractive shrub layer of oak-leaf hydrangea, Rhododendron, downy mock-orange and deer berry. In addition to this, in the lower hills forests and side to the stream, there is a covering of huge sugar maples, beeches, white oaks as well as tulip poplars under which there are different varieties of small bushes such as alder, spicebush and so forth. Moreover, beneath the waterfalls there are a large variety of bladdernut and dogwood (Stillhouse Hollow Falls Class I Scenic-Recreational State Natural Area, 2020). Lastly, the nearby areas of the upper slopes include large oaks plus hickories. In addition to this, Summertown, Maury County, Tennessee where the Stillhouse Hollow Falls is located have wide–ranging terrain as well as soils. Pertaining to this, the area has a profusion of flora encompassing around one hundred and fifty types of native trees. The state tree is Tulip and many other trees as mentioned above like red oaks, pine and chestnut black are commonly found in the east direction of the state (Tennessee, 2020). Besides, walnut, cottonwood and gum maple also grow plentiful in this area. Mountain laurel and blossoms of wild azalea support in creating a blaze of colour in the mountains. There are around three hundred native Tennessee plants such as digitalis as well as ginseng which are being used for therapeutic drives. Nevertheless, in the year 2003, there were around twenty species of plants and trees which were registered as endangered or scarce in Tennessee, for example, sandwort and Blue Ridge goldenrod. Talking about it further, the ecosystem of the Summertown, Maury County offers habitats for many types of birds, species of turtles and insects. Even bats, red squirrels, foxes, bears, jumping mice, mussels, chipmunks and frogs are very common in this area (Tennessee, 2020). Furthermore, animals in this town are generally found in high elevation, cave and river ecosystems. Besides this, different mammals also live in it or travel by the high elevation ecosystem of the southernmost section of Appalachian Mountains such as eastern chipmunks, red squirrels and spotted skunks. Moreover, the Stillhouse Hollow Falls also offers habitats for mice and bobcats.

Note that long-lived ships could be rearmed several times. Many earlier ships went through periodic repairs and rebuildings (many now unrecorded) during which their dimensions and their armament changed considerably. =Henry VII (additions 1485–1509)= The number of guns listed in various sources is not really relevant; most of the large number quoted in contemporary records were small anti-personnel weapons, and the number of these would vary from time to time (changes usually unrecorded).

The concept of cutting gunports into the lower deck emerged early in the period, and relatively few heavy guns were carried. Even the largest would only have heavy guns numbering in single figures, the remainder being small anti-personnel weapons.

Primarily sailing warships, with oars as ancillary means of propulsion. Twelve were built for Henry VIII in three groups between 1536 and 1546, and two further vessels of the type were captured from the Scottish Navy and added to the English fleet. As the oars were found to detract from their sailing performance, they were removed by the time of Henry's death and in 1549 all fourteen galleasses were re-classed as 'ships'. Those in good condition were rebuilt as small galleons in 1558 (six) or 1570 (two). First group These four vessels were three-masted galleasses, each with a low forecastle and three pairs of gunports set along the rowing deck. * Lion (1536) - taken to pieces 1552 * Jennet (1539) - rebuilt as a galleon 1558 * Dragon (1542) - taken to pieces 1552 * Greyhound (1545) - rebuilt as a galleon 1558 Second group The four ships built to this type (together with two similar vessels captured from the Scots) were four-masted galleasses with a higher forecastle. They also had three or four pairs of gunports on the lower deck, but also a couple of smaller pairs on the half-deck above. * New Bark (1543) - rebuilt as a galleon 1558 * Swallow (1544) - rebuilt as a galleon 1558 * Unicorn (captured 1544 from the Royal Scots Navy) - taken to pieces 1552 * Salamander (built 1537 in France and captured 1544 from the Royal Scots Navy) - condemned 1559 * Grand Mistress (1545) - sol to take to pieces 1552 * Anne Gallant (1545) - gone by 1560 Last group Also four-masted, these were flush- decked vessels, with the forecastle joined to the half-deck to form a continuous upper deck. * Heart (1546) - rebuilt as a galleon 1558 * Antelope 38 (1546) - rebuilt as a galleon 1558 * Bull 26 (1546) - rebuilt as a galleon 1570 * Tiger (1546) - rebuilt as a galleon 1570  Other small vessels  These were classed as pinnaces ** Great Zebra (1522) - last recorded 1525 ** Less Zebra (1522) - last recorded 1525 ** Mary Grace (a hoy Mary of Homflete, captured 1522 from the French) - last recorded 1525 ** Great Pinnace (1544, but may have been the Great Zabra renamed) - last recorded 1545 ** Less Pinnace (1544, but may have been the Less Zabra renamed) - last recorded 1549 ** Falcon (1544) - listed as a ship from 1557, last recorded 1578 ** Roo (built 1545) - captured by the French 1547 ** Marlion or Martin (captured from the French 1545) - last recorded 1549 ** Saker (built 1545) - listed as a ship from 1557, last recorded 1565 ** Hind (built 1545) - listed as a ship from 1557, sold 1557 ** Brigantine (built 1545) - captured by the French 1552 ** Hare (built 1545) - sold 1573 ** Phoenix (purchased 1546) - listed as ship from 1557, rebuilt 1558 and sold 1573 ** Trego Ronnyger (1546) - last recorded 1549 Also in 1546, thirteen armed rowbarges of 20 tons each were built - Double Rose, Flower de Luce (captured by the French in 1562), Sun, Harp, Cloud in the Sun, Hawthorne, Three Ostrich Feathers, Falcon in the Fetterlock, Portcullis, Rose in the Sun, Maidenhead, Roseslip and Gillyflower. The first three of these were rebuilt in 1557–58 and classed as pinnaces, the next five named above were sold in 1548–49 (for £154.4.0d each) and the last five were condemned in 1552. =Edward VI (additions 1547–1553)= Notwithstanding the considerable number of minor additions below, few significant vessels were added during this brief reign, and the majority of those that were added are prizes.

The largest of the great ships were categorised as ships royal, while the remainder were grouped as middling ships or small ships. Note that ships royal would under Charles I become the first rank (later first rate) ships; similarly, great ships would become the second rank (later second rate) ships; middling ships would become the third rank (later third rate) ships; and small ships would become the fourth rank (later fourth rate) ships - later to be further sub-divided (about 1650) into fourth, fifth and sixth rates. * Ships royal (later, first rank ships) ** 40 guns (1608) - a rebuilding of the Ark Royal of 1587. ** 51 guns (1610) - a replacement for (not a rebuilding of) the Victory of 1560. ** 40 guns (1615) - a rebuilding of the ship of 1590. * Great ships (later, second rank ships) Originally with 32-34 guns, by 1660 this had increased to 56 guns (64 in the Triumph). ** 34 guns (1605) - a second rebuilding of the Hope of 1559. ** 32 guns (1605) - a rebuilding of the Nonpareil of 1584 (itself a rebuilding of the Philip and Mary of 1556. ** 32 guns (1609) - a second rebuilding of the Golden Lion of 1557. ** 34 guns (1610) - a rebuilding of the ship of 1596. ** 34 guns (1613) - a rebuilding of the ship of 1590. ** 34 guns (1615) - a rebuilding of the ship of 1586. ** 34 guns (1615) - a rebuilding of the ship of 1586. ** 42 (1619) – Joined Royalists June 1648, lost September 1651. ** 42 (1620) – Rebuilt 1666. ** 42 (1621) – Rebuilt 1654. ** 42 (1622) - Renamed George 1649 but resumed name St George 1660, hulked 1687 and then sunk as a blockship 1697. ** 42 (1622) - Renamed Andrew 1649 but resumed name St Andrew 1660, wrecked 1666. ** 42 (1623) - Sold 1688. * Middling ships (later, third rank ships) Originally with only 28 or 30 guns, this was raised to 30-34 by 1633 and 40 guns by 1652. ** 29 guns (1607) - a second rebuilding of the Swiftsure of 1592. ** 28 guns (1614) - a second rebuilding of the ship of 1573. ** 30 guns (1618) - a second rebuilding of the ship of 1546. ** 28 (1619) - Burnt 1658 by accident. ** 28 (1620) - Captured by the Netherlands at the Battle of Dungeness, 1652. ** 30 (1621) - Blew up and sunk at the Battle of Leghorn, 1653. ** 30 guns (1620) - built as the Destiny for Sir Walter Ralegh in 1616, and acquired by the Navy in 1620 - sold at Lisbon by the Royalists 1650. * Small ships (later, fourth rank ships) ** 18 guns (1613) - not mentioned after 1624. ** 26 (1623) - Wrecked 1650. =New and rebuilt ships, Charles I (1625–1642)= Note that this list only included the first part of Charles's reign preceding the English Civil War (i.e. up to 1642), Subsequent acquisitions are listed in the following section. * First rank (ships royal) ** 102 (1637) - Renamed Sovereign, renamed Royal Sovereign, rebuilt 1660 ** First Rank, 70 (rebuilt 1641) - Rearmed to 80, rebuilt again 1663 * Second rank (great ships) ** Second Rank, 40 (rebuilt 1629) - Rearmed to 56 guns by 1660, sunk as a breakwater 1680. ** Second Rank, 40 (rebuilt 1631) - Rearmed to 56, wrecked, sold 1667 ** 44 (1632) - Renamed Liberty 1649, wrecked 1650 ** 42 (1633) - Renamed Paragon 1650, lost 1655 ** 48 (c. 1634) – rearmed as 60 guns by 1660, sold 1682 ** 46 (1634) - rearmed as 56 guns by 1660, sold 1688 * Third rank (middling ships) ** 34 (1634) ** 34 (1635) - Captured by Netherlands 1653 ** Third Rank, 40 (rebuilt 1640) – Rebuilt again 1658 =Lesser ships= Early frigates * 10 (1636) - Collision 1641 * 12 (1636) - Blown up in action 1656 * 14/30 (1637) - Sold 1667 * 14/30 (1637) - Wrecked 1668 =Captured ships, 1625–1636= * (ex-French, captured 1625) * 38 (ex- French, captured 1625) * (ex-French, captured 1625) * (ex-French, captured 1626) * (ex-French, captured 1626) * (ex-French, captured 1627) * 42 (ex- Dutch, captured 1627 from French) * (ex-Dunkirker, captured 1635) - Sunk 1638 * 6 (ex-Dunkirker, captured 1636) - Sold 1657  List of major English warships of the English Civil War, the Commonwealth and Protectorate (1642–1660)  The interregnum between the execution of Charles I in 1649 and the Restoration of royal authority in 1660 saw the full emergence of the ship- of-the-line and its employment during the first Anglo-Dutch War. During this period the English navy technically became first the Commonwealth Navy, later the Protectorate Navy and subsequently the Commonwealth Navy again; the prefix \\"HMS\\" is thus not applicable to any English warship during the Interregnum. The following lists include ships of the line, i.e. vessels of the first, second, third and fourth rates which were judged fit to stand in the line of battle. Smaller warships of the fifth and sixth rates, and the even smaller unrated vessels, appear in the subsequent section. Under the categorisation as amended in late 1653, the rates were based on the number of men in the established complement of a ship, as follows: *First rate, 400 men and over. *Second rate, 300 men and up to 399. *Third rate, 200 men and up to 299. *Fourth rate, 140 men and up to 199. However, there were numerous exceptions, and ships changed their Rating from time to time. :Number of main guns follows name (see rating system of the Royal Navy) :The larger ships are listed in pages 159–160 of The Ship of the Line Volume I, by Brian Lavery, published by Conways, 1983, , and more fully in British Warships in the Age of Sail: 1603–1714, by Rif Winfield, published by Seaforth Publishing, 2009, .

Further fines were levied when the mall opened to the public without actually first obtaining an operating license.Taipei Times - archives In February 2002, a fire at the mall required the evacuation of 20,000 people. The fire was determined to be arson, and in July 2002 former Core Pacific official Lin Chang-cheng (林長成) was convicted of the crime along with two others, Wang Lin-kwun (王林坤) and Lin Ching-chi (林清吉). Losses were estimated at NT$12 million., The opening of Taipei 101's mall in 2003 was expected to affect the revenues of Core Pacific's tenants, although less severely than at other malls due to Core Pacific's lower price points.Shopping Centers Today In 2004, the mall's management company was cited by Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission for unfair trade practices relating to a gift certificate promotion campaign. In March 2018, the Core Pacific Group put up the shopping mall for auction with real estate broker Cushman & Wakefield. The auction opened to the public on 12 December 2018 with an opening price of NT$38 billion. Core Pacific City closed on 30 November 2019.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era, and resulted in communist victory. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and keep their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek's own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek's before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaboration. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek's objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek's orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek's ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Battle By the end of August 1945, communist New Fourth Army and other local troop units had surrounded the town of Lingbi (灵璧) of Anhui Province. The communist decided to take Lingbi (灵璧) in Anhui by force after the local defenders consisted of former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II refused to surrender. In early September 1945, a 700 strong reinforcement was sent from nearby Solid Town (Guzhen, 固镇) in attempt to help the besieged defenders, but the reinforcement was beaten back by the communists. At the night of September 4, 1945, the communists launched their general assault against the town and after six hours of fierce battle, the town was firmly in communist hands. The communists had managed to kill 104 enemy troops, and captured another 1,244, including the commander Zhao Shusen (赵树森). In addition, the poorly equipped communists also captured one mortar, 8 machine guns, 1,355 rifles. The communist victory also resulted in joining their bases in one by eliminating all enemy strongholds in the region. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai- shek's secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists’ loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist government.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era, and resulted in communist victory. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to “maintain order” in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek’s own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek’s before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek’s objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek’s orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek’s ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders’ surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Battle On August 26, 1945, the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division of the communist New Fourth Army decided to take Yin Village (Yinji, 尹集) of Wuyang (舞阳) County in southern Henan by force after the local defenders consisted of former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II refused to surrender. The 38th Regiment, 2 battalions of 39th Regiment, and 4 companies of the 4th Marching-on Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division of the communist New Fourth Army attacked the village from both the east and the west. The communist 38th Regiment first annihilated a regiment of defenders at the outskirt of the village while at night, the two battalions of the communist 39th Regiment annihilated another regiment of defenders at Cypress Village Camp (Baizhuangzhai, 柏庄寨). After losing two regiments and all of strongholds outside the village, the remaining defenders lost the will to fight and escaped to Wuyang (舞阳) on August 27, 1945. The communists managed to capture more than 800 defenders alive and over 300 guns in their victory. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek’s attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake.

In addition, the communists also captured more than 60 machine guns and over 600 firearms, and the vast stretch of 100 km along the Grand Canal of China from Gaoyou to Huai'an had fallen to the communist hands.

Grease ice is the second stage in the formation of solid sea ice after ice floes and then frazil ice. New sea ice formation takes place throughout the winter in the Arctic. The first ice that forms in a polynya are loose ice crystals called frazil ice. If the level of turbulence is sufficient, the frazil ice will be mixed down into the upper layer and form a surface layer of grease ice. The term ‘grease ice’ follows World Meteorological Organization nomenclature. Grease ice differs from ‘slush’, where slush is similarly created by snow falling into the top layer of an ocean basin, river, or lake. The two terms are related due to the process of ice crystals being blown into a polynya which can be the initiation of the grease ice layer, given a minimum level of mixing and cooling of the ocean surface. Formation When the water surface begins to lose heat rapidly, the water becomes supercooled. Turbulence, caused by strong winds or flow from a river, will mix the supercooled water throughout its entire depth. The supercooled water will already be encouraging the formation of small ice crystals (frazil ice) and the crystals will be mixed into the upper layer and form a surface layer. Sea ice growth in turbulent water differs from sea ice growth in calm water. In turbulent water, the ice crystals accumulate at the surface, forming a grease- ice layer composed of individual ice crystals and small irregular clumps of ice crystals. In calm water conditions, nilas, a thick elastic crust, forms at the surface, which thickens as water molecules freeze to the ice-water interface.

The ester must contain an electron-withdrawing group in the beta position, such as β-ketoesters, malonic esters, α-cyanoesters, or α-sulfonylesters. It works best with methyl esters, since it is an SN2-reaction at carbon. It is driven by the entropy of the overall reaction, as the byproducts chloromethane and CO2 are lost as gases. The reaction is a useful synthetic procedure to hydrolyze and decarboxylate malonic esters because it only cleaves one of the ester groups. The alternative way (e.g. basic hydrolysis) destroys both of the ester groups and a subsequent reaction is usually used to regenerate the alkylated ester. :500px References Elimination reactions Substitution reactions Name reactions ","title":"Krapcho decarboxylation"},{"id":"13205523","text":"Ross Bolleter (born 1946, Subiaco, Western Australia) is a composer and musician whose work is focused on ruined pianos. His recordings are available on Emanem (London), Pogus (New York), New Albion (San Francisco) and Tall Poppies (Sydney), as well as on his WARPS (World Association for Ruined Piano Studies) label. Career =Music= Bolleter studied the music theory as well as its history and composition at the University of Western Australia between 1964 and 1967. This fired his interest in the music of composers such as Webern, Boulez and Cage. After playing the piano for six years at the Parmelia Hilton, he explored non-conventional timbral and rhythmic possibilities of the prepared piano and released a cassette, The Temple of Joyous Bones, which featured the piano. Bolleter found inspiration in the eighties playing and recording improvised music with flautist Tos Mahoney and double bassist, Ryszard Ratajczak. Over the past thirty years Bolleter has explored the timbral possibilities of ruined pianos, as quoted: old pianos that have been exposed to the elements of time and weather thus acquiring novel and unexpected musical possibilities. A piano is ruined (rather than neglected or devastated) when it has been abandoned to all weathers and has become a decaying box of unpredictable dongs, tonks and dedoomps. The notes that do not work are at least as interesting as those that do. Ross Bolleter has five ruined pianos in his kitchen including the original ruined piano from Nallan Sheep Station, near Cue, 800 km north east of Perth, Western Australia. At Kim Hack's and Penny Mossops's olive farm, Wambyn, near York, Western Australia, Kim Hack and Bolleter developed the Ruined Piano Sanctuary, where some forty pianos are ruining in their own ways, and at their own pace, variously under trees, in dams, and on roofs. Bolleter's recent CD Frontier Piano, which represents the best of his work from 2007–2014, is almost entirely devoted to recordings of these dying pianos. Each piano in decay is a long-running composition. Death comes to every piano, and dying, each sings a different kind of song. In 1989 Bolleter set up the Synchronicity Project where he devised a series of intuitive pieces where musicians improvised simultaneously but in different centres in Australia and across the world. In several instances these pieces were set up to cast a net for synchronistic events, especially musical synchronicities. The Synchronicity Project produced a series of radiophonic works. The first of these works was Simulplay 1 (September 1989) had Jim Denley playing flute to a live audience at the B rucknerhaus in the Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria – with Bolleter playing piano and accordion, together with Carol Henning playing plastic trombone, in the ABC radio studios, Perth. The second work, That Time/Simulplay 2 – an intuitive piece for two musicians on opposite sides of a continent, playing at precisely the same time but unable to hear each other, while a radio audience hears both of them – involved Ryszard Ratajczak playing double bass in Studio 210 of ABC FM Sydney with Bolleter playing both pianos in separate recordings in ABC's Studio 621, Perth. That Time/Simulplay 2 was released on the Pogus label, New York, as part of the album Crow Country in 2000. Another radiophonic piece Pocket Sky: a worldwide link up between Jim Denley (Radio ORF Vienna), Stevie Wishart (BBC London), David Moss (SFR Berlin), Jon Rose (ABC Sydney), Simone de Haan (ABC Melbourne), and Bolleter (ABC Perth), took place on 21 October 1991. It was released as the CD Pocket Sky (2004) (WARPS W08). Bolleter's 1996 piece Left Hand of the Universe CD (WARPS W02) linked up Michal Murin and other Slovak and Czech musicians in Bratislava, and Stephen Scott and various musicians at Colorado College, without recourse to radio. All the musicians were playing ruined instruments, or were in the process of ruining them. Left Hand of the Universe was released on CD in 1997 as WARPS W02. Bolleter's output also includes two CDs of café music: Paradise Café and Café Sophia which feature him playing the accordion, his film music, and his songs. Bolleter's songs, sung by Anthony Cormican, are also featured on their CD Songs from the Third Watch. This CD includes Bolleter's setting of Kenneth Slessor's 1937 poem Five Bells and Cormican's setting of Billy Strayhorn's Lush Life. Bolleter has released more than twenty CDs, primarily of ruined piano compositions and improvisations. His CD Crow Country, released on the Pogus label as Pogus 7 6034-21021-2 (New York, 2000.), was nominated as one of the 10 best albums of 1999 by Cadence Magazine (New York) and constitutes the best of his work from 1988 to 1999. Secret Sandhills and Satellites, released on the Emanem label, London, UK (2006), was voted best CD of September 2006 by Blow Up magazine (Italy), and number two CD of the year by dMute Magazine (Jazz and Improvised Music), France. Secret Sandhills and Satellites presents the best of Bolleter's work from 2001 to 2006. Bolleter has performed with a variety of artists including Kavisha Mazzella, Tos Mahoney, Ryszard Ratajczak, Mark Cain, K.K.Null, Jim Denley, Jon Rose, David Moss, Simone de Haan, Michal Murin, Zdenek Plachy, Milan Adanciak, Stephen Scott, David Kotlowy, and Richard Lynn – as well as with bands such as the Black Eyed Susans. From 2000 to 2016, he has worked with producer/composer Anthony Cormican in a collaboration uniting Anthony's work with the music editing program Pro Tools with his own ultra-low tech ruined pianos. Since 2010, Bolleter has collaborated with the visual artist and composer Antoinette Carrier in work which includes her woven pianos as well as her creation of the first urban Piano Sanctuary in Bedford, Western Australia. Carrier's CD Nothing as a Thing was released on the WARPS label. Bolleter performed as an accordionist/story teller at the Adelaide Festival of 1998, and on ruined piano(s) at the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM) in \\"Piano!\\" (2009), in the Ten Days on the Island Festival, where he created the project \\"Ruined\\" (2008) and in various of Tura New Music's Totally Huge New Music Festivals under the artistic direction of Tos Mahoney, beginning with the Ruined Piano Convergence of 2005. Bolleter's work is regularly featured on ABC's Radio National and ABC FM. Film maker Robert Castiglione has made a film of Bolleter's work with ruined pianos entitled Invitation to Ruin. It was shown in Tura's Totally Huge New Music Festival of 2015. Andrew Ford, in his book In Defence of Classical Music has a chapter on Bolleter's work entitled Things fall apart in the music of Ross Bolleter. =Ross Bolleter, Zen Teacher= Ross Bolleter is an Australian Zen Buddhist teacher in the Diamond Sangha lineage.

The agreement renewed a treaty of 1693 the natives had made with Governor Sir William Phips, two in a series of attempts to establish peace between the Wabanaki Confederacy and colonists after Queen Anne's War. Queen Anne's War During the War of the Spanish Succession, France began a conflict with England which would extend to their colonies. Called Queen Anne's War in the New World, New France openly fought New England for domination of the region between them, with the French enlisting the Abenaki tribes inhabiting it as allies. Occasionally under French command, Indians attacked numerous English settlements along the Maine coast, including Casco (now Portland), Scarborough, Saco, Wells, York and Berwick, in New Hampshire at Hampton, Dover, Oyster River Plantation (now Durham), and Exeter, and down into Massachusetts at Haverhill, Groton and Deerfield, site of the Deerfield Massacre. Houses were burned, and the inhabitants either killed or abducted to Canada. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, however, restored peace between France and England. As part of the agreement, Acadia fell under British sovereignty. When the Indians realised that they could no longer depend on the French for protection, the sachems sought a truce, and proposed a peace conference to be held at Casco. Joseph Dudley, governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, agreed to a conference, but chose instead to host it at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which was protected by the guns of Fort William and Mary. For a more detailed timeline of events leading from first contact to the 1713 treaty, see references and resources.http://www.1713treatyofportsmouth.com Articles of agreement On July 11, 1713, Governor Dudley and various dignitaries from New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bay (which then included Maine) met with delegates from Abenaki tribes, including the Amasacontee, Maliseet, Norridgewock, Pennacook, Penobscot and Sokoki. The agreement was read aloud by sworn interpreters to the sachems, eight of whom on July 13 signed with totemic pictographs. It is important to note that historians have found that New England politicians and translators engaged in a \\"policy of deception\\" with Wabanakis. Consequently, Wabanakis would claim in subsequent years that several articles written into the treaty were at odds with verbal agreements, especially regarding British claims to sovereignty over them.David L. Ghere, \\"Mistranslations and Misinformation: Diplomacy on the Maine Frontier, 1725 to 1755,\\" American Indian Culture and Research Journal 8, no. 4 (1984): 19. Others would sign the following year after a similar interpretation at another convention. \\"Being sensible of our great offence and folly,\\" the Indians agreed to: * acknowledge themselves submissive, obedient subjects of Queen Anne * cease all acts of hostility towards subjects of Great Britain and their estates * allow English settlers to return to their former settlements without molestation or claims by the Indians * trade only at English trading posts established, managed and regulated with governmental approval * not come near English plantations or settlements below the Saco River, \\"to prevent mischiefs and inconveniences\\" * address all grievances in an English court, rather than in \\"private revenge\\" * confess that they had broken peace agreements made in 1693, 1699, 1702 and 1703, and now ask for forgiveness and mercy * not make any \\"perfidious treaty or correspondence\\" [with the French] against the English; should any exist, to reveal it \\"seasonally\\" * cast themselves upon Her Majesty for mercy and pardon for past rebellions, hostilities and violations of their promises Image:Treaty of Portsmouth (1713) 1.jpgPage 1 Image:Treaty of Portsmouth (1713) 2.jpgPage 2 Image:Treaty of Portsmouth (1713) 3.jpgPage 3 Image:Treaty of Portsmouth (1713) 4.jpgPage 4 At the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth were also the St John River Maliseet [Wolastoqiyik], Mi'kmaw (Mi'kmaq), and Abenaki [Aln8bak] nations of Acadia. According to a Mi'kmaw History Post-Contact timeline, the treaty ensured they were not to be molested in their lands and were \\"to enjoy free liberty for hunting, fishing, fowling, and all other lawful liberties and privileges\\". The Wabanaki regarded the Treaty of Portsmouth as the reaffirmation of the Treaty of 1699 at Mare's Point, limiting British settlements to the west of the Kennebec River, while the British also would keep Port Royal (Annapolis Royal). The Mi'kmaq and Maliseet stated that Acadia [Lnue'gati] belonged to them, and that the French King could not give it to the English King, since he did not own it. The British made efforts to win over the Wabanaki by using superior goods and ceremonial presents for the fur trade. They also tried to have the Wabanaki expel French soldiers and priests from their villages, but without much success. The Mi'kmaq did not sign the Treaty of Portsmouth. The British saw the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Treaty of Portsmouth as an opportunity to regain the settlements of Saco, Scarborough, and Falmouth, and a new chance to exploit the Wabanaki territories between the Kennebec and St Croix rivers, in violation of the treaty.http://www.muiniskw.org/pgHistory2.htm Aftermath The English failed to fulfil their obligations under the treaty. Massachusetts did not, as promised, establish official trading posts selling cheap goods at honest prices to the Indians. Tribes were forced to continue exchanging their furs with private traders, who were notorious for cheating them. In addition, Indians regarded as threats the British blockhouses being built on their lands, and objected to ongoing encroachment of settlers on lands they claimed. Their discontent was encouraged by Sebastien Rale and other French Jesuit priests embedded with the tribes who promoted New France's interests. In response to what they perceived as British violations of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Abenakis resumed raids on the encroaching British settlements. Consequently, on July 25, 1722, Governor Samuel Shute declared war against the Eastern Indians in what would be called Father Rale's War. Boundary struggles between New France and New England would continue until the Treaty of Paris in 1763.

Geology The volcano has a diameter of and is constructed from andesites erupted through three stages of activity. Two nested craters lie on its summit and have diameters of . Volcán Lagunita is a neighbouring volcano and is more heavily eroded and hydrothermally altered. =Regional setting= Cerro del León is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, a volcanic belt in the Andes. Volcanic activity occurs since the Oligocene and includes dacitic–rhyolitic ignimbrites. On top of these the main volcanic arc, including andesitic- dacitic stratovolcanoes, has formed away from the Peru–Chile Trench on a crust thick. San Pedro and Lascar have historical activity, but only a few volcanoes have been studied, namely Lascar, Ollagüe and Parinacota. The volcano is part of the San Pedro-Linzor lineament, a long volcanic chain that extends northwest-southeastward. It was constructed on top the Toconce and Sifon Ignimbrites. The alignment was active during the late Pleistocene–Holocene and contains San Pedro-San Pablo–Paniri–Cerro del León–Toconce–Linzor. =Eruption history= The volcano was constructed in various phases. The base of the volcano is constructed from andesitic lava flows that directly overlie the ignimbrite basement. These at first erupted in the west and east, subsequently northwest and southeast. Dacites and andesites form the last stage and the bulk of the edifice. The volcano was subject to glaciation, leaving moraines down to altitude, formed during the last glaciation 15,000–11,000 years ago. Glacial effects are noticeable on the north-northwest flanks. =Petrology= Lavas contain phenocrysts of plagioclase with variable amounts of biotite, clinopyroxene, opaque minerals and orthopyroxene. The matrix is glassy and contains hornblende and plagioclase. The lavas have vesicular and minor proportions of amygdaloid, porphyric, trachytic and vitrophyric texture.  Religious importance  Cerro del Leon is a holy mountain for the local territory. An Inca religious site is located on its summit.

The battle was one of the Chinese Civil War in the immediate post World War II era, and resulted in communist victory. Prelude Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also rooted from the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized that his nationalist regime simply had neither the sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his troops into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the communists who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their turncoat Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the communists and kept their fighting capabilities to \\"maintain order\\" in the Japanese occupied regions, fighting off the communists as necessary, until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the nationalists. However, most of these former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek's own clique, but instead, they were mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under the Chiang Kai-shek's before World War II, since they were nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi-independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese side when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaborations. After World War II, these forces of former Japanese puppet regimes once again returned to the nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously, it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords for good as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined nationalists, because such move would alienate other factions within the nationalist ranks, and these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords could still help the nationalists to gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek's objective was to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, which proved to be an extremely fatal mistake for him and his nationalist regime later on, as shown in this conflict. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the nationalists would be able to hold on to the regions long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops by holding off communists. If the communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result would still benefit to Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, and the warlord problem plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time, communists would be weakened by the fights and Chiang's own troops would have easier time to take control. For the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces, these warlords and their troops had no problem of following Chiang Kai-shek's orders, and they were eager to prove themselves. These warlords and their troops were well aware that due to the collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War, they were well hated by the general population in China, including those nationalists who refused to surrender to the enemy and fought the enemy until the eventual victory. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly be disarmed and discharged, which would probably be the best outcome and the power of these warlord would be reduced or even completely eliminated as a result. Chiang Kai-shek's ordering them not surrendering to the communists and fighting off the communists was a savior for them because by carrying out such orders, these warlords and their troops could legitimize themselves and thus retain their power by fighting the communists who were targeted as rebels by Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime. Communist Strategy The communist strategy was much simpler than that of the nationalists because there was not any huge division within the communist rank like that of the nationalist. The communists already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the nationalist withdrew, and after successfully establishing communist bases in the rural regions where better life was provided to the general populace in comparison to that of Japanese occupied regions, the general Chinese populace agreed that the communists were well deserved to represent the China to accept the invaders' surrender in the region and takeover the regions occupied by the invaders. Order of battle Nationalist *3rd Division *Other units *Japanese troops Communist *1st Column of the communist Jiangsu – Zhejiang Military Region Campaign Showing counties or districts taken by the communist forces in Southern Jiangsu and parts of Anhui and Zhejiang in August 1945. On September 8, 1945, the 1st Column of the communist Jiangsu – Zhejiang Military Region decided to take controls of regions in central Jiangsu, northern Zhejiang and adjacent regions in Anhui by force after the local defenders consisted of Japanese troops and former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force who rejoined the nationalists after World War II refused to surrender. Since mid August, 1945, over a dozen enemy strongholds in the region from Jurong (句容) County in Jiangsu in the north to Changxing (长兴) County in Zhejiang in the south had fallen into the communist hands, including those at Front Horse (Qianma, 前马), Southern Crossing (Nandu, 南渡), Celestial King Temple (Tianwangsi, 天王寺), Baonian (宝埝) and Jiapu (夹铺 on Taihu Lake in Changxing County) regions. On August 14, 1945, the 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force totaling over 1,200 ventured out Jurong (句容) in an attempt to counterattack, and they were assisted by two companies of Japanese troops. The 1st Regiment of the 1st Column of the communist Jiangsu – Zhejiang Military Region ambushed the enemy at Zhang Family's Hills (Zhangjiagang, 张家岗), and Duan Family's Bridge (Duanjiaqiao, 段家桥) regions, and after an eleven-hour long fight, succeeded in killing over 30 Japanese troops and over 370 nationalist troops, including the regimental commander of the nationalist 8th Regiment of the 3rd Division. One Japanese troops and over 350 nationalist troops were also captured alive by the communist troops. On August 19, 1945, the 1st Column of the communist Jiangsu – Zhejiang Military Region attacked Jintan and Liyang, and annihilated the defenders consisted of a detachment of Japanese troops and two regiments of former nationalists turned Japanese puppet regime force in the process. Over 1,700 nationalist troops were captured alive by the attacking communists. Four artillery pieces and 48 machine guns also fell into communist hands. Taking advantage of their gains, communists took towns of Lishui (溧水), Gaochun (高淳), and towns of Eastern Hill, River Ripe (Hushu, 湖熟) of Jiangning (江宁) County, threatened the suburb of Nanjing. On August 24, 1945, Ji'an fell into communist hands, and on August 25, 1945, Langxi County fell into the communist hands. The campaign finally concluded on August 28, 1945, when Guangde County fell into communist hands. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek's secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists' loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist government.

The development was constructed following the closure of Hunt Valley Mall (other than its anchor stores) in 2000. The anchor stores in existence today include Dick's Sporting Goods, Burlington Coat Factory and Wegmans. Wal-Mart was located at Hunt Valley mall until late October 2007, when it moved two miles south to Cockeysville, Maryland. It was replaced by Best Buy, which closed in May 2012 as part of a nationwide downsizing. Near a gazebo located in the main street area of the center, there is a memorial to Chuck Thompson. History Hunt Valley Mall was planned as early as 1979, but its construction was opposed both by local residents, citing spreading suburbification and the potential for runoff into Loch Raven Reservoir, and by the Baltimore County government, who preferred that development be focused in Owings Mills and White Marsh. Despite this, and the Baltimore County executive at the time, Donald Hutchinson, refusing to attend the opening ceremony, the mall opened on September 17, 1981. It was developed by Myles H. Tanenbaum and Kravco Company of King of Prussia, PA, and designed by Leonard Kagan of RTKL Associates. Some of Hunt Valley's \\"sister malls\\" were Valley Hills Mall, Beachwood Place, White Marsh Mall, Charleston Town Center and Stratford Square Mall, after which it was modeled. The mall had space for four anchor tenants, but Sears and Bamberger's, which became Macy's in 1986, were the only ones to open, leading the mall to a fate that paralleled Seaview Square Mall in Ocean Township, New Jersey. Other major department stores were in negotiations with the mall, such as Hutzler's, which was slated for the location across from the food court, and JCPenney. Hunt Valley Mall's non- anchor stores included Hair Cuttery, Chess King, CVS, Piercing Pagoda, Kay Bee Toys, Sun Coast Video, Listening Booth Music, Florsheim Shoes, Hess Woman's Apparel, Art Explosion, Merry Go Round, Hudson Trail Outfitters, Deb, Paul Harris, The Wild Pair, Sir Walter Raleigh Inn and others. There were two sets of escalators as well as a prominent glass elevator at the center of the mall surrounded by a fountain. Small zigzag-shaped waterfalls were at opposite ends of the mall. When Macy's closed the former space was split into Dick's and Burlington Coat Factory on the upper and lower floors, respectively, removing the elevators and escalators inside the store space. Once this happened, the stairs at the rear mall entrance were replaced with escalators, which remained in place after redevelopment. Hunt Valley's official mascot was Hunter the Valley Bear. Transit connections In 1997, the Baltimore Light Rail was extended north from its then-terminus at Timonium station to Hunt Valley station in the parking lot of Hunt Valley Mall. There were hopes that this would increase business to the struggling mall. Increased lighting, security officers and off duty police were added to ward off any additional crime. Prior to the light rail's extension, the mall was served by Maryland Transit Administration Bus Route 9. Today, this route operates to the nearby International Circle. Downfall and rebirth Hunt Valley Mall never recovered from its inauspicious opening. Its success over the following two decades was limited, and as a result, many of the merchants failed by the end of the 1990s. Competition from White Marsh, which opened a month earlier, as well as Golden Ring Mall, Columbia Mall, Towson Town Center and Owings Mills Mall did not help matters either. This resulted in plans being made to convert the mall into an outdoor town center with big-box stores. As of June 23, 2017, the original Sears store in the Hunt Valley Towne Centre, an original part of the Mall that was one of 235 properties Sears Holdings spun off into Seritage Growth Properties in 2015,http://www.seritage.com/retail/property/126-shawan- rd/3312545/landing is closing, as part of Sears' announcement of closing 20 stores across the United States. Part of the first level of the former Sears is expected to become Michaels and HomeGoods. In fiction Hunt Valley Mall was an inspiration for the fictional \\"S'Wallow Valley Mall and Pizza Court\\" in Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie.

It is named after Ehecatl, the Aztec god of the wind.  Overview  A prototype of the airplane was presented in the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget on June 19, 2007. In August 2007 at Washington D.C., a full-scale model was exhibited at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) symposium, an aeronautics exposition with over 275 exhibitors. At the conclusion of the AUSVI symposium Hydra Technologies became the first non-U.S. recipient of the AUSVI's 'Al Aube Outstanding Contributor Award' for the development of the S4 Ehécatl UAS (Unmanned Aerial System). In 2008, Hydra Technologies received the Leonardo da Vinci award, given by the International Aeronautics Congress of Mexico (CIAM for its Spanish abbreviation) for the development of the S4 Ehácatl, as well as the E1 Gavilán. On August 3, 2008, the State of Jalisco and Coecytjal presented Hydra with an award in the 29th Annual National Convention of the National Chamber of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics Industry (CANIETI), for its contribution to the informatics, microelectronics and communications industries in Mexico.  Description  The S4 Ehécatl is an aerial unmanned surveillance system whose development began in 2002. Its principal market is directed towards providing security and surveillance capabilities in support of the Armed Forces, as well as civilian protection in hazardous situations. Because of its small size and unmanned nature, it can enter dangerous zones without being detected. Apart from a U.S.-made FLIR infrared thermal sensor system, all of the S4 Ehécatl's componentry and avionics are designed, developed and manufactured in Mexico by the firm Hydra Technologies.Hydra Technologies Surprises UAV Industry with Mexican-Made System The S4 Ehécatl has an electronic system that is designed to provide up to eight hours of autonomous flight, in either daytime or nighttime conditions. The craft is controlled from a mobile central facility installed in a specially equipped three-man ground vehicle.War planes, Mexico rolls its own The surveillance capabilities of the UAV was suggested as an option to survey of the border problems between the U.S. and Mexico.

He was a right-handed pitcher who appeared in 90 games, 44 as a starter, in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers (1946–48) and Boston Red Sox (1950–52). The native of East Glenn, Indiana, stood tall and weighed . Taylor's professional career lasted from 1938 through 1955, with five seasons (1941–45) missed due to United States Army service in World War II and another two (1953–54) out of organized baseball in the semipro ranks. He spent the entire 1947 campaign on the Dodgers' big-league roster, winning ten of 15 decisions with 20 starting assignments and two shutouts. It was an eventful season for Brooklyn that saw Jackie Robinson break the baseball color line in the Major Leagues, manager Leo Durocher's season-long suspension for \\"conduct detrimental to baseball\\", and the Dodgers win their seventh overall National League pennant. Taylor was the Dodgers' starting pitcher in Game 4 of the 1947 World Series on October 3 at Ebbets Field. Matched against the New York Yankees' Bill Bevens, Taylor failed to record an out, facing four batters in the first inning and allowing two singles, a base on balls, a fielder's choice (the batter reaching on an error) and an unearned run before being relieved by Hal Gregg, who got out of the inning without further scoring. Bevens, meanwhile, threw 8 innings of no-hit baseball. But the Yankee hurler allowed ten bases on balls, and his no-hitter and game were ruined by pinch hitter Cookie Lavagetto's double, the Dodgers winning what some call \\"The Cookie Game\\", 3–2. Taylor returned to the minor leagues during the 1948 season, and spent almost all of the following two years at Triple-A. But in September 1950, his contract was purchased by the Red Sox, who were chasing the Yankees and Detroit Tigers in the American League pennant race. After one game in relief, he threw two complete game victories, September 25 against the Philadelphia Athletics (a two-hit shutout) and October 1 against the Yankees. But Boston fell short in the standings, finishing in third place, four games behind the Yankees. In his 90 MLB games, Taylor worked 357 innings pitched, and allowed 344 hits and 201 bases on balls. He recorded 127 strikeouts, 16 complete games and four saves. He posted a .161 batting average (20-for-124) in his career. He fielded his position well, recording a .990 fielding percentage with only one error in 105 total chances.

A further five appearances that season brought Turner little success, and nor did a handful more the following season. In 1913 he played a solitary match for H. K.

However, he did not again pass 30 that season, although he did pick up the first of his two first- class wickets when he accounted for Warwickshire's Frederick Santall at Worcester at the end of August. 1920 saw Turner both hit another half-century — 85 against Warwickshire in August — and take his other wicket — that of Sussex's George Stannard. The following year, which proved to be his last in the game, Turner scored his only century, hitting 106 against Northamptonshire, though Worcestershire suffered a 356-run defeat, which as of 2007 remains Northants' greatest-ever margin of runs victory.

Generally called \\"Daisy\\" by those close to her, Suckley was the fourth of seven children, and a sixth cousin of Franklin D. Roosevelt. She grew up at Wilderstein, where she was a neighbor of the future president. Suckley attended Bryn Mawr College from 1912 until 1914, when her mother forbade her from finishing her degree. During World War I she served on Ellis Island as a nurse's aide. Much of her family's trade and shipping fortune was lost during the Great Depression, but she and Franklin Roosevelt remained close. Association with Roosevelt In the early 1930s Suckley and Roosevelt spoke of having a cottage built at a shared favorite spot they called \\"Our Hill\\", which eventually became Roosevelt's Top Cottage. Two of the rare photographs of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in a wheelchair were taken by Suckley there. Suckley raised Scottish terriers and gave one to President Roosevelt, which he renamed Fala. The dog quickly became famous, and Suckley wrote a children's book about him. During World War II, Suckley often stayed for long visits at the White House, keeping the president company. Although Roosevelt is known to have had an affair with Lucy Mercer during World War I, there is no direct evidence that he had a similar relationship with Suckley, although there was an emotional connection. Roosevelt apparently instructed Suckley to burn at least some of the letters he wrote to her, which has fueled speculation about their content. Surviving letters include affectionate personal remarks, as well as reports and reflections about the progress of the war and meetings with figures such as Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference. After Roosevelt died, his daughter Anna Roosevelt Halsted and a friend came upon a cache of Suckley's letters, hidden in the box from his stamp collection that Roosevelt took everywhere with him. There is no indication, however, that his daughter read or understood the significance of the letters, which she returned to Suckley. After Roosevelt's death Having served as Roosevelt's personal archivist, Suckley played a key role in setting up the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, where she worked until 1963. In 1980 she helped establish Wilderstein Preservation Inc, a group dedicated to preserving the house and 45-acre riverfront property of her family home, now a National Historic Landmark. She continued to live at Wilderstein until her death. Suckley died on June 29, 1991, in Rhinebeck, New York, at the age of 99. Cultural references Numerous newspaper articles published about Suckley have speculated about her relationship with Roosevelt. Suckley's relationship with Roosevelt was the subject of a book, Closest Companion (1995), by historian Geoffrey Ward. The relationship is also the subject of a play centered on the 1939 visit to Hyde Park by King George VI, by playwright Richard Nelson titled Hyde Park on Hudson. Drawn from Suckley's private journals, Nelson's play fictionalizes Suckley's relationship with FDR as sexual, even though most biographers suggest otherwise. A production of Nelson's play was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2009. The story was also adapted into the 2012 motion picture Hyde Park on Hudson, with Laura Linney as Suckley, Bill Murray as Roosevelt, and Samuel West as King George VI. Focusing on how the historical events and people are portrayed, Conrad Black, author of Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom, said Nelson's portrayal took \\"large, …. sometimes scurrilous, liberties with historical facts.\\" In particular, he stated that Nelson erred in his depiction both of Roosevelt's relationship with women and of Eleanor Roosevelt's sexuality. Roosevelt biographer Geoffrey Ward wrote, \\"It is true that they drove to a hilltop that they loved at some point in 1935, and that something happened on that hilltop.… And it started a long, first flirtatious and then very fond friendship. But what happened in the film did not happen.\\"Ward, Geoffrey. \\"'Hyde Park': An FDR Portrait That's More Fiction Than Fact\\", NPR, December 26, 2012. Suckley features prominently in Ken Burns' 2014 documentary series, The Roosevelts: An Intimate History. Her words are read by Patricia Clarkson.

Voting Rights Act lawsuit Madera Unified's capitulation when faced with a 2008 lawsuit about the manner in which school board trustees were elected, as well as a judge's related ruling on the matter, has reportedly influenced other California school districts and other governmental bodies to change from at-large representation, which dominates the state's school districts, to a by-district system. Four Madera plaintiffs, represented by San Francisco-based Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, alleged that the at-large voting system resulted in racial polarization that resulted in the city's Latino majority of 82 percent being politically marginalized, which they said violated the state's 2002 Voting Rights Act.\\"Madera Unified case is changing elections throughout California,\\" Los Angeles Times, Jan. 4, 2009, http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/04/local/me-madera4 That statistic is slightly misleading, however, as only 44 percent of those eligible to vote in an MUSD election were Latinos, according to a press release by Anayma DeFrias of the aforementioned LCCR.

As of 2013 increased state funding has allowed the district to hire additional teachers to reduce class sizes in K-3. Eastin-Arcola was re-opened in 2014. The other cuts remain in place. Recent superintendents The Madera Unified School Board placed Superintendent John Stafford on leave with pay for the remainder of the 2010-11 school year. No reason was given. After a short search a new superintendent, Gustavo Balderas, was hired in 2011 on a three-year contract. Balderas surprised the district by resigning to take another superintendent position in Southern California in 2012. During the search for a replacement for Balderas accusations were made of improper conduct by several board members in regards to the search, and that search was aborted and an investigation launched. In the meantime the board rehired former superintendent Julie O'Kane as interim. In July 2013 it was announced that Ed Gonzales, former teacher and principal in Madera Unified, was hired as superintendent.

It was bundled with the Wii Zapper peripheral and was the first title to use it. The game was released in North America in November 2007, in Europe and Australia in December 2007, and in Japan in May 2008. It uses several environments, enemies, and other assets from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess as stages for targets with various shootable background objects. Gameplay Link's Crossbow Training is set in a world in the style of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and in the game the player assumes the role of the protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link. To perfect Link's crossbow marksmanship, the player must pass a series of tests, starting with stationary bullseye targets, before moving onto moving targets and actual enemies. After every level, the player gets a medal depending upon their score. The types of medals range from bronze to platinum. Link's Crossbow Training features 9 playable levels, and the goal in each is to achieve the highest score possible within the time limit. These levels are divided into three main gameplay styles. *In Target Shooting levels, players fire their crossbow at targets, which start stationary, but move as the difficulty increases in later levels. Hitting the center of the bullseye earns more points, and the points earned multiplies if the player hits subsequent targets without missing. *In Defender levels, players remain stationary, while retaining the ability to shoot and aim through 360°. Here, Link must fight off hordes of enemies, including Stalfos in a desert-themed level, and defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins. If Link takes damage the player's score will decrease. *In Ranger levels, the player assumes complete control over Link (via the control stick on the Nunchuk), in levels including a siege on an enemy encampment, and fighting through a forest. In some levels, Link battles bosses, most of them having weak spots that the player must hit. Link's Crossbow Training has a multiplayer mode, where players take turns competing for the highest score. Development Link's Crossbow Training was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, Eiji Aonuma and Takashi Tezuka. The idea of a first-person The Legend of Zelda title started with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which Miyamoto wanted to develop in the first person; however, the inclusion of a child Link got in the way of this idea. Miyamoto also created the game to show Japanese gamers how fun the genre can be by bridging the gap between simple scrolling shooters and advanced shooters. It was also made with the intent of being a side-story to The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and make use of its vast overworld. The development staff began work on the game's story, which Miyamoto intended to be an extra story based around Twilight Princess. However, the staff had been coming up with what could be better described as \\"epic tales\\" rather than \\"side stories\\". When Miyamoto revealed that he would not make the game with an \\"epic tale\\", much of the staff was shocked, saying it was like killing all of the ideas they had been working with until then. Some argued that they should not even do it, as it would be simply reusing existing software and selling it to the consumers. Miyamoto proposed that they make a working prototype and have test players give impressions of the game. If they did not like it, Miyamoto would stop development right there. Nintendo of America gathered together several die-hard The Legend of Zelda fans, who all reacted positively to the game. Reports from these test players were given to the development team daily, allowing them to tweak the game as they went along. Miyamoto created a list of \\"do nots\\" for the development team, including not incorporating anything unnecessary, not \\"making a movie\\", and making sure a player could be able to complete a stage within three minutes, so as to not discourage the player from trying to beat the level again if he or she fails. Miyamoto also told the developers to not get caught up in the rewards, letting the players focus on the \\"journey\\" first, and to not include any boss battles so the developers could focus on making the whole game entertaining rather than focusing on making bosses. Miyamoto eventually gave in after the developers insisted on there being three bosses in the game, although he reduced that to one to make them focus on making one \\"fabulous\\" boss battle instead of attempting to make three boss battles. Choosing which game to use the Wii Zapper with proved to be difficult. Because the project was due to the ideas of The Legend of Zelda staff, Miyamoto wanted to be in The Legend of Zelda universe, although some staff argued that giving Link a gun would be too strange. Miyamoto proposed a Terminator-style plot about a time warp to the future, but the idea was vetoed immediately. Miyamoto enjoyed the Hidden Village from Twilight Princesss spaghetti western theme, and recreated it so people could enjoy it in an FPS setting. He also thought using the Wii Zapper in a western theme would make it even more fun. The development team eventually settled for giving Link a crossbow. Despite crossbows being unable to do a rapid-fire effect, Miyamoto felt that because it is just for fun, they did it anyway. The game was originally titled Introduction to Wii Zapper. However, the development team opted to change this, to avoid confusion with Introduction to Wii, the Japanese title of Wii Play. The team also did not want to call it something like The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Crossbow, as it would appear to be a grand-scaled sequel in The Legend of Zelda series, and they did not want it to be interpreted as such. They settled for Link's Crossbow Training in the end. On July 11, 2007, Nintendo announced during its E3 2007 media briefing that a new game would be bundled with the Wii Zapper accessory. It was not announced until the GameStop Expo in September 2007 that Link's Crossbow Training was that game. Nintendo's official announcement of this came on September 10, 2007. Reception Reviews were generally mixed. Nintendo Power stated \\"In the way that Link's Crossbow Training shows the potential of the zapper, it couldn't be much better.\\" However, they criticized it for being \\"Just too darn short–you'll probably make it through the entire single-player mode in just over an hour (add another hour to get platinum medals on every stage).\\" IGN stated that the game was enjoyable, but agreed that it was too short. IGN's review also panned the Wii Zapper as actually \\"making the game more difficult\\" to play and generally frustrating to use. =Sales= By July 2008, the game had sold 194,849 copies in Japan.Weekly Famitsu, issue 1020 By September 2008, the game had sold 2.75 million copies worldwide. It was the 16th best-selling game and seventh best-selling Wii game of December 2008 in the United States. It was in the Top 10 on the best- selling Wii games list for nearly two years until being surpassed by Wii Sports Resort, Wii Fit Plus, and later New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

As a publisher, he produced Arthur Conan Doyle's books; as a politician, he beat him to win election to the House of Commons. Canadian origins Brown was born in Toronto, the son of newspaper publisher Hon. George Brown who was Liberal Party Member of Parliament for Ontario South and a Father of Canadian Confederation. He was sent to the leading private school Upper Canada College, and then back to his father's native Scotland to Merchiston Castle School from where he won entry into King's College, Cambridge. Business life On leaving Cambridge, Brown became managing trustee of Thomas Nelson and Sons, an Edinburgh-based publisher; as a publisher he was following in his father's profession. One of Nelson's most popular authors was Dr Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1901 Brown married Mary Nelson, daughter of the founder of the firm. Political career When William McEwan announced his retirement as Liberal Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Central, Brown was chosen to fight the seat.\\"Scotland And The Coming Election\\", The Times, 17 August 1900, p. 6. The Unionists did not choose their candidate for the seat until much closer to the election, but when they did, Brown found himself opposed by Dr Conan Doyle, standing as a Liberal Unionist.\\"Scotland\\", The Times, 25 September 1900, p. 8.

Established in 1912, the college operated until 1983. History The college was founded in 1912 as the Nasson Institute and changed its name twenty-three years later, in 1935. As the Nasson Institute, the college operated as a two-year women's program. It became a four-year college in 1935, turning co-ed in 1952. After turning co-ed, Nasson quickly grew into a well-respected, four-year accredited liberal arts college, reaching a student enrollment of over 900 in the late 1960s. Nasson offered majors in such fields as Biology, English, Environmental Science, Government, History, Mathematics, Medical Technology, and many more subjects. On a campus in the village of Springvale, ME, the campus included a learning resources center housing the library (115,000 volumes, and 950 current periodicals), audio-visual services, and more; a science center equipped with a rooftop greenhouse, radiation laboratory and laboratories for the sciences, a gymnasium, little theatre, dining commons, classroom buildings, health clinic, and student center. Nasson also had a total of 11 living units ranging from small frame houses to large dormitories. Local benefactors included William and Marion C. Goodall Marland, for whom a dormitory building was named. =The New Division= In 1963, President Roger C. Gay proposed the possibility of having one or more colleges, under the control of Nasson College. The planning and preparation began, and in the fall of 1966 the New Division, an experimental college was established. The aim was to provide a liberal education involving extensive student participation in social, academic and discipline policy; independent study in provinces of knowledge, not in individual courses. The New Division operated from a separate, newly constructed building located west of the original campus, containing both housing and community facilities. The realities of operating two substantially different educational models (the old and new divisions) under the same college umbrella resulted in substantial internal conflict at Nasson, primarily voiced by faculty members at the old division. As a result, the New Division's autonomy was rescinded in 1969. Most New Division faculty and students left for other alternative institutions, and the program was formally ended the following year. The shakeup also saw Gay's removal as college president. Many students arrived in the Fall of 1970 expecting to be joining the New Division, only to find that that the college was defunct. Most left Nasson for other colleges. =Closure= Faced with declining enrollment (due to the close of the New Division) and financial pressures, Nasson College eventually closed in 1983. Most of the buildings on the original campus are now being adaptively reused for other purposes. The three buildings located on the west campus (including the New Division building) were obtained in the 1990s by a group hoping to establish a preparatory school on the site; building renovations were only partially completed, however, and in 2008 the property was for sale.

The duo moved on to produce cartoons for MGM, the first of which were released in 1934. The music score was a work of Frank Marsales. Director and production While Hugh Harman is credited with directing the film, animation historians believe that Friz Freleng was his uncredited co-director. The attempt of Bosko to leap into a movie screen and into the film depicted on screen is a reference to the film Sherlock Jr. (1924). The short recycles certain scenes from earlier shorts: Bosko at the Beach, Bosko's Dog Race, Bosko in Person, Bosko and Bruno, and Box Car Blues. Plot The film opens to an exterior shot of a movie theater. The camera moves to the interior, where curtains and barn doors open to reveal a movie screen. The screen introduces the host of the movie show, Bosko, who is playing a \\"Furtilizer\\" organ. The term itself is a play on the name Wurlitzer, as Wurlitzer pipe organs were regularly used in theaters of the time. Bosko leads the audience in the song \\"We're in the Money\\" (1933). The film then proceeds to parody newsreels, in a format similar to The March of Time,Birdwell (1999), p. 5-34 created in 1935. The newsreel depicted is called Out-Of-Tone News and the accompanying tagline Sees All, Hears All, Smells All. This was a reference to Movietone News, which had the slogan Sees all, Hears All, Knows All. Various scenes of world news appear. The first of them takes place in Geneva, Switzerland, where a peace conference is supposedly taking place. Actually the attending world leaders are depicted engaging in hand-to-hand combat, while a ring announcer gives a blow-by-blow description of the action. The following scene takes place in Malibu, California. A title card reports that it is supposedly about the Sunkist Bathing Beauties enjoying the sunshine of California. The scene then contradicts the card by depicting a single, unattractive woman on a beach during a snowstorm. She is attempting to evade a tidal wave. The next scene takes place in Reno, Nevada, where boxer \\"Jack Dumpsey\\" (Jack Dempsey) is reported training for a comeback. He is depicted as a \\"withered old man with a cane\\". Followed by a scene taking place in \\"Epsom Salts, England\\", depicting a race among blue-blood dogs. The defending champion Bruno, Bosko's pet dog, is depicted sniffing around and trailing his competitors. Until he finds himself chased by the Marx Brothers, equipped as dog catchers. The final scene of the newsreel takes place in \\"Pretzel, Germany\\", where Adolf Hitler is depicted pursuing Jimmy Durante with a meat cleaver or axe in hand. Hitler is depicted as a ruthless and violent buffoon, wearing lederhosen and an armband depicting a swastika. Durante shouts the phrase \\"Am I mortified!\\". (Aside from newsreels, this is argued to be the first depiction of Hitler in an American film,Birdwell (1999), p. 5-34Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 30Welky (2008), p. 41-42 although there is an earlier appearance in the August 1933 short Cubby's World Flight by the Van Beuren Studios; while flying over Germany, Cubby Bear receives smiles and waves from both Chancellor Hitler and President Paul von Hindenburg.) The newsreel then ends with the tagline It Squeaks for Itself. This a reference to another slogan of Movietone News: It Speaks for Itself. The newsreel is followed by a short subject parodying Laurel and Hardy, who are called here \\"Haurel and Lardy\\", starring in \\"Spite of Everything\\". The two comedians are depicted finding a cooling pie on a window sill and stealing it. Then they argue over ownership of the pie. The pie switches hands many times, until Haurel ends their rivalry by pieing Lardy. In retaliation, Lardy uses a discarded pot to hit Haurel. The subject ends with Haurel crying. The last film of the show follows. It is a \\"TNT Pictures\\" production, its logo featuring a roaring (and burping) lion. This is a reference to Leo the Lion, the mascot of Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. The film itself is a melodrama set in the 1890s, entitled \\"He Done Her Dirt (and How!)\\". Honey, Bosko's girlfriend, is depicted riding a bicycle. She is followed by the Marx Brothers, who sing Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two) (1892). Then a title card introduces the villain, \\"Dirty Dalton (The Cur!)\\". Dalton hides behind a tree and manages to ambush Honey, abducting her. He then \\"leaps off a cliff and onto a train passing underneath\\", ending with his victim on top of a runaway railroad car. Honey breaks the fourth wall by asking for assistance from the audience. Bosko volunteers to save her and leaps towards the screen. He fails to enter the world of the 1890s film and goes through the screen. But his efforts leave a hole where Dalton's head should be, disabling the villain and somehow rescuing Honey. Honey applauds, Bosko raises his hands in triumph, and the animated short ends. Profanity Pre-Hays Code Hollywood films (both animated and live-action) were notorious for pushing the boundaries of what was considered taboo at the time, particularly the use of curse words and profane terms. For example, the Flip the Frog series often features the term \\"damn\\". In The Milkman (1932), part of the series, a character uses the term \\"hell\\" in the context of the phrase \\"What the hell do we care\\".Cohen (2004), p. 15 But this short is considered unusual for the supposed use of another term. When the villain first appears onscreen, Bosko shouts what sounds like \\"The dirty fuck.\\" The word is not clearly heard, due to a muffled vowel and it has been argued that a flaw in the soundtrack rendered profane a more \\"polite\\" phrase, such as \\"dirty fox\\" or \\"dirty mug\\". Animator Mark Kausler has studied the lip movements of the character and insisted that \\"mug\\" was the intended word.Cohen (2004), p. 15 He initially believed that the sound flaw only appeared on the 16 mm film version, and tried to re-record the sound from a 35 mm, nitrate film to correct this, leading to no better results, since listeners still heard the disputed word as \\"fuck\\". Animation historian Jerry Beck also had several people see the film, and they all concluded that Bosko did indeed call the film villain a \\"dirty fuck.\\"Cohen (2004), p. 15 According to the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6 DVD set the subtitles for that scene read, \\"The dirty fox!\\", despite that \\"The dirty fuck!\\" can clearly be heard. Fans have theorized that the inclusion of a really nasty curse word was most likely a parting shot by Harman and Ising to Warner Bros. animation head Leon Schlesinger, with whom they disputed over various matters, though this seems unlikely as both Schlesinger and Warners would have reviewed the cartoon prior to release and edited out the offending line (unless both Schlesinger and Warners misheard the line as \\"The dirty fox!\\", which is most likely what happened in this case, after the recent revelation). However, Nickelodeon ran the short in the early 1990s with an edit to the clip that is safe enough for younger audiences. The offending line was edited to \\"The dirty cur!\\".

(2000). \`I AM A MAN A MAN?’: Race, Masculinity, and the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike. Labor History, 41(2), 153. https://doi.org/10.1080/00236560050009914 The deaths served as a breaking point for more than 1,300 African American men from the Memphis Department of Public Works as they demanded higher wages, time and a half overtime, dues check-off, safety measures, and pay for the rainy days when they were told to go home. The Memphis sanitation strike was led by T.O. Jones and had the support of Jerry Wurf, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). On February 22, 1968, the City Council was pressured by a sit-in of sanitation worker supporters to vote on the recognition of the union and recommend a wage increase. Mayor Henry Loeb refused to recognize the strike and rejected the City Council vote, insisting that only he possessed the power to recognize the union. The Memphis sanitation strike prompted Martin Luther King Jr.'s presence, where he famously gave the “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop” speech a day before his assassination. Background The city of Memphis had a long history of segregation and unfair treatment for black residents. The influential politician E. H. Crump had created a city police force, much of it culled from the Ku Klux Klan, that acted violently toward the black population and maintained Jim Crow. Blacks were excluded from unions and paid much less than whites—conditions which persisted and sometimes worsened in the first half of the 20th century. During the New Deal, blacks were able to organize as part of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a group which Crump called communist \\"nigger unionism.\\" However, organized black labor was set back by anti-communist fear after World War II. Civil rights and unionism in Memphis were thus heavily stifled all through the 1950s. The civil rights struggle was renewed in the 1960s, starting with desegregation sit-ins in the summer of 1960. The NAACP and SCLC were particularly active in Memphis during this period. Memphis sanitation workers were mostly black. They enjoyed few of the protections that other workers had; their pay was low and they could be fired (usually by white supervisors) without warning. In 1960 the average sanitation worker in Memphis earned between $0.94-$1.14 an hour, however in 1968 sanitation laborers earned $1.60 a hour and garbage truck drivers earned $1.90 a hour.($12.06-$14.32 in 2019 dollars). In addition to their sanitation work, often including unpaid overtime, many worked other jobs or appealed to welfare and public housing. =Union activities= In the early 1960s, black sanitation works united together to gain better wages and working conditions, fighting the racial discrimination in the Memphis Public Works Department. The first attempt to strike was in 1963, but it failed because there was inadequate organization. Many blacks were afraid to unionize due to the fear of persecution, which was justified in 1963, when 33 sanitation workers were fired immediately after attending an organizing meeting. In November 1964, Local 1733 of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) was successfully formed by T.O. Jones. However, the city officials refused to recognize the union. In 1966, the union attempted another strike, but it was thwarted before it began when the city prepared strikebreakers and threatened to jail leaders. The failure of the strike was largely due to the lack of support of Memphis’ religious community or middle class. =Precursors= At the end of 1967, Henry Loeb was elected as mayor against the opposition of Memphis's black community. Loeb had served previously as the head of the sanitation division (as the elected Public Works Commissioner), and during his tenure oversaw grueling work conditions — including no city-issued uniforms, no restrooms, and no grievance procedure for the numerous occasions on which they were underpaid. Upon taking office, Loeb increased regulations on the city's workers and appointed Charles Blackburn as the Public Works Commissioner. Loeb ordered Jones and the union to deal with Blackburn; Blackburn said he had no authority to change the city's policies. Some of the garbage packers faced the added danger of working on antiquated trucks they called \\"wiener-barrel\\" trucks. This was the kind of truck that Echol Cole and Robert Walker were working the day they were killed. (Photo: Southern Hollows/S. Liles) Course of the strike On February 1, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, two sanitation workers, were crushed to death in a garbage compactor where they were taking shelter from the rain. Two other men had died this way in 1964, but the city refused to replace the defective equipment. On February 11, hundreds of workers came to a meeting at the Memphis Labor Temple, furious with their working conditions. The workers left the meeting with no organized plan, but a feeling that something had to be done—immediately. On Monday, February 12, 1,375 Memphis sanitation and public employees did not show up for work. Some of those who did show up walked off when they found out about the apparent strike. Mayor Loeb, infuriated, refused to meet with the strikers. The workers marched from their union hall to a meeting at the City Council chamber; there, they were met with 40–50 police officers. Loeb led the workers to a nearby auditorium, where he asked them to return to work. They laughed and booed him, then applauded union leaders who spoke. At one point, Loeb grabbed the microphone from AFSCME International organizer Bill Lucy and shouted \\"Go back to work!\\", storming out of the meeting soon after. The workers declined. By February 15, there was 10,000 tons of noticeable piled up trash, and Loeb began to hire strikebreakers. These individuals were white and traveled with police escorts. They were not well received by the strikers, and the strikers assaulted the strikebreakers in some cases. On February 18, AFSCME International President Jerry Wurf arrives in Memphis, exclaiming that the strike will only end when the workers’ demands are met. Wurf worked with national union representative P.J. Ciampa and local union leaders to edit the strikers’ list of demands. The revised version of demands included 10% wage increase, a grievance procedure, fair promotion policies, sick leave, pension programs, health insurance, payroll deduction of union dues, and union recognition through a written contract. Mayor Loeb continued to refuse union recognition and dues withdrawn from wages because he argued that AFSCME officials only wanted to fill their pockets with the hard-earned money of local Memphians. Loeb believed that he was the sanitation workers’ keeper and he would not abandon his “moral obligation” to protect them from union officials. Local black leaders and sanitation workers saw this “rhetoric smacked of paternalism reminiscent of slavery.” The sanitation workers were men and were more than capable of making their own decisions. By February 21, the sanitation workers established a daily routine of meeting at noon with nearly a thousand strikers and then marching from Clayborn Temple to downtown. The first large-scale protest of Loeb’s policies came on February 23. It was given the moniker “miniriot” after it turned violent. Gwen Robinson Awsumb, the city council liaison to the mayor, accused Loeb of deliberately impeding the council’s progress in resolving the strike. The marchers faced police brutality in the forms of mace, tear gas, and billy clubs. On February 24, while addressing the strikers after a \\"police assault\\" on their protests, Reverend James Lawson said, \\"For at the heart of racism is the idea that a man is not a man, that a person is not a person. You are human beings. You are men. You deserve dignity.\\" Rev. Lawson's comments embody the message behind the iconic placards from the sanitation workers' strike, \\"I Am A Man\\". On the evening of February 26, Clayborn Temple held over a thousand supporters of the movement. Reverend Ralph Jackson charged the crowd to not rest until \\"justice and jobs\\" prevailed for all black Americans. That night they raised $1,600 to support the Movement. Rev. Jackson declared further that once the immediate demands of the strikers were met, the movement would focus on ending police brutality, as well as improving housing and education across the city for black Memphians. > Our Henry, who art in City Hall, Hard-headed be thy name. Thy kingdom > C.O.M.E. Our will be done, In Memphis, as it is in heaven. Give us this day > our Dues Checkoff, And forgive us our boycott, As we forgive those who spray > MACE against us. And lead us not into shame, But deliver us from LOEB! For > OURS is justice, jobs, and dignity, Forever and ever. Amen. FREEDOM! — > \\"Sanitation Workers' Prayer\\" recited by Reverend Malcolm Blackburn National civil rights leaders including Roy Wilkins, Bayard Rustin, and James Lawson came to Memphis to rally the sanitation workers. On March 18, Martin Luther King Jr. came to Memphis to praise a 25,000 crowd of labor and civil right activists for their unity stating, “You are demonstrating that we can stick together. You are demonstrating that we are all tied in a single garment of destiny, and that if one black person suffers, if one black person is down, we are all down.” King encouraged the group to continue to support the sanitation strike by enacting a citywide work stoppage. King promised to return to Memphis on March 22 to lead a protest through the city. On March 22, a massive snowstorm hit Memphis, causing the organizers to reschedule the march for March 28. City officials estimated that 22,000 students skipped school to participate in the march. King arrived late to find a massive crowd on the brink of chaos, causing Lawson and King to call off the demonstration as violence erupted. Lawson told the demonstration participants to return to Clayborn Temple. The policed followed the crowd back to the church where they released tear gas and clubbed people. In the midst of the chaos, a police shot and killed sixteen-year-old Larry Payne. Witnesses said Payne had his hands raised as the officer pressed a shotgun to Payne's stomach and fired it. On April 2, Payne's funeral was held in Clayborn Temple. Despite police pressure to have a private closed-casket funeral in their home, the family held the funeral at Clayborn and had an open casket. Following the funeral, the sanitation workers marched peacefully downtown. The violent events that took place on March 28 were sparked by the presence of a black youth group called the Invaders, who were committed to “Black Power.” King was unaware of the divisions within the community and considered not returning to Memphis. However, King realized and stated that “nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis.” King went on to say, “The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land.” On April 3, King returned to Memphis where he famously gave his “I’ve been to the mountaintop” speech. =Media coverage= The local news media were generally favorable to Loeb, portraying union leaders (and later Martin Luther King Jr.) as meddling outsiders. The Commercial Appeal wrote editorials (and published cartoons) praising the mayor for his toughness. Newspapers and television stations generally portrayed the mayor as calm and reasonable, and the protesters and organizers as unruly and disorganized. The Tri-State Defender, an African American newspaper, and The Sou'wester, a local college newspaper, reported the events of the strike from the sanitation workers' perspective. These publications emphasized the brutality of the police reactions to the protestors. Roles of the union Membership in Local 1733 increased substantially during the course of the strike, more than doubling in the first few days. Its relationship with other unions was complex. =National leadership= The AFSCME leadership in Washington was initially upset to learn of the strike, which they thought would not succeed. P. J. Ciampa, a field organizer for the AFL–CIO, reportedly reacted to news of the strike saying, \\"Good God Almighty, I need a strike in Memphis like I need another hole in the head!\\" However, both AFSCME and the AFL–CIO sent representatives to Memphis; these organizers came to support the strike upon recognizing the determination of the workers. Jones, Lucy, Ciampa, and other union leaders, asked the striking workers to focus on labor solidarity and downplay racism. The workers refused. =Local unions= During the strike, Local 1733 received direct support from URW Local 186. Local 186 had the largest black membership in Memphis, and allowed the strikers to use their union hall for meetings. Most white union leaders in Memphis feared the blackness of the strikers, and expressed concern about race riots. Tommy Powell, president of the Memphis Labor Council, was one of few local white advocates. End of the strike President Obama met former members of the strike in 2011 King's assassination (April 4, 1968) intensified the strike. Mayor Loeb and others feared rioting, which had already begun in Washington, D.C., Federal officials, including Attorney General Ramsey Clark, urged Loeb to make concessions to the strikers in order to avoid violence. Loeb refused. On April 8, a completely silent march with the SCLC, Coretta Scott King, and UAW president Walter Reuther attracted 42,000 participants. Reuther wrote a check for $50,000 to the striking sanitation workers, the largest contribution from any outside source. The strike ended on April 16, 1968, with a settlement that included union recognition and wage increases, although additional strikes had to be threatened to force the City of Memphis to honor its agreements. The period was a turning point for black activism and union activity in Memphis. In July 2017, Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland announced that the city would offer $50,000 in tax-free grants to the 14 surviving 1968 sanitation strikers, who were either still on payroll to maintain standard of living or could not retire in relative comfort as they had to forgo pension and thus receiving a small Social Security check monthly.  Accolades  In October 2017, Baxter Leach represented the sanitation strikers at the National Civil Rights Museum Freedom Awards. Leach was one of the original sanitation workers who participated in the Memphis sanitation strike and served as the public face of the surviving sanitation workers. In 2018, Leach along with the other surviving sanitation strikers was presented with the NAACP Vanguard Award.

Only two were built. Design and development It was a low-wing monoplane based on the earlier Moth biplanes with a stressed plywood covering and the cockpit designed around its test pilot, Hubert Broad, to make it as streamlined as possible: this resulted in the fuselage sides being sloped outwards to accommodate his shoulders. The Tiger Moth had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail skid. The first aircraft built (registration G-EBQU) first flew from Stag Lane Aerodrome on 24 June 1927 and was fitted with an ADC Cirrus II engine to check its handling characteristics. This was then replaced with Major Halford's prototype engine, by then named the Gipsy. The second example, G-EBRV, was fitted with a Cirrus engine and first flew on 28 July 1927. Operational history Both aircraft were entered for the 1927 King's Cup Race which was to be held at Hucknall on 30 July; 'QU was withdrawn but Broad flew 'RV in the race, retiring because of handling problems. In August 1927 Broad flew G-EBQU over a 62-mile (100 km) closed-circuit to set a new record for Class III Light Aircraft of 186.47 mph (300.09 km/h). Five days later he flew to 19,191 ft (5,849 m) without oxygen in an attempt to break the altitude record for its category.

They may be shaped as balls or pads. Historically, powder puffs have been made of very fine down feathers, cotton, fine fleece, etc. In modern times synthetic materials are widely used for powder puffs. In addition to softness, an important characteristic of powder puffs is their intake ability, i.e., the ability to hold powder. It was reported that for synthetic fibers important factors in designing high-intake powder puffs are mostly geometric ones: fiber diameter, pile length, and space between fibers, with little dependence on material factors.\\"Intake Ability of Powder Puffs Made of Synthetic-fiber Cloths\\" , Journal of the Japan Research Association for Textile End-Uses (2005), vol. 46, no. 8. 519-528. Powder puffs have been used as a stereotype image for soft, careless femininity, as seen, e.g., in the term \\"powderpuff sports\\", including collegiate sorority flag football leagues. The name of the Powerpuff Girls is a pun on \\"powder puff\\".

Its focus is mostly on the same-sex marriages performed in San Francisco from February 12 to March 11, 2004. A major fundraising event for Equality California was also inspired by, and named after, the film. Director Geoff Callan, along with San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and philanthropists Christopher Bently and Wilkes Bashford, hosted a wedding celebration titled The Pursuit of Equality in order to increase public awareness of this issue before the November 4th vote on California Proposition 8. Synopsis By issuing same-sex marriage licenses, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom uproots the status quo, attempts to change the way the nation looks at life, love, and marriage. From the first frame of the film, even before the press is aware, this film crew is with Mayor Gavin Newsom's senior staff as the nation's first same-sex couple exchange their vows and ignite a controversial civil rights topic. The story continues on the streets, in the courtrooms, and on the steps of City Hall, where same-sex couples clash with church groups who declare that their sexual and romantic desires are sinful. The film focuses on the compelling, human rights struggles surrounding same- sex marriage and captures the elation and despair of couples and families who are fighting for equal rights. This film made the independent film festival circuit, winning multiple awards, and is scheduled for a wider release in the United States in 2008.

Design Stick-built, balloon-framed kit houses were built as permanent, not temporary structures, as the manager of the Sears, Roebuck lumber department explained to a United States Senate committee in 1919:United States Senate. Hearings before a subcommittee of the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds, 66th Congress. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1919. (See copy of letter from Sears lumber department, p. 719.) > A ready-cut house should not be confused with a sectional-portable house, > which can be taken down and moved by being unbolted. A ready-cut house is a > permanent house and the method of its construction is not different from any > other frame house where the lumber is framed (or cut to its proper length, > notched, etc.), by hand by carpenters. Unlike modular homes, which are built in sections at a factory, in a kit house every separate piece of lumber was shipped already numbered and cut to fit its particular place in the house, thus eliminating the need for measuring and cutting, and likewise the waste of time (especially in the days before power tools) and of materials. Thus, kit home manufacturers claimed to save the customer as much as 30 to 40 percent over traditional building methods. This description by researcher Dale Wolicki of kit house manufacture by the Gordon- Van Tine Company was typical of other kit house companies' efforts as well: > All designs were standardized to maximize efficiency and reduce waste in > materials and labor. Lumber and hardware were purchased in bulk. The > factories had skilled employees and special machines to cut difficult pieces > such as rafters and staircases. Lumber was pre-cut to length, guaranteed to > fit, ready to nail, and labeled for easy assembly. Floor joists and > bridging, sub-flooring, finished flooring, studs, rafters, sheathing, > clapboards, shingles, stucco, plaster or drywall, columns, railings, doors > and windows, hardware, nails, and paint for two exterior coats were included > in the order. Plumbing, electrical, and heating systems were available for > an additional charge. Although the lumber and hardware were standardized, > the designs were not and buyers were encouraged to personalize their order. > Many models had two or three floor plans, while the exterior could be > clapboards, shingles, stucco, or framed for brick. Walls, windows, and doors > could be moved, added or eliminated. Porches, sun rooms, flower boxes, > trellises, balconies, built-in cabinets, and a variety of door and sash > patterns were available at an additional charge. Delivery and construction Depending on the size and style of the plan, the materials needed to construct a typical house, including perhaps 10,000–30,000 pieces of lumber and other building material, would fill one or two railroad boxcars,\\"Kit Houses,\\" National Trust for Historic Preservation Library Collection, University of Maryland. Retrieved 5 Aug 2013.Standard size boxcars were 40 feet long and about ten feet wide until railroads began using longer ones in the 1960s. which would be loaded at the company's mill and sent to the customer's home town, where they would be parked on a siding or in a freight yard for unloading. Once the materials arrived, a customer would arrange for a local carpenter or contractor to assemble the house on a piece of property owned by the customer; or a customer who was handy with tools might assemble all or part of the house himself in several weeks or a few months' time. The resulting houses were indistinguishable in quality and appearance from those built by traditional methods, if not better, yet were often significantly cheaper to build because of the savings on carpenters' and contractors' wages; and the cost of high-quality lumber bought from a large kit house company often was lower than at the local lumber yard. In addition, some companies, including Sears, Montgomery Ward, Gordon-Van Tine, and Harris Brothers, offered cash discounts and generous mortgage terms.Wolicki, Dale, \\"Magazine,\\" gordonvantine.com, accessed 28 June 2011 For most homeowners, the complete cost of building a kit house was about double the catalog price, allowing for the construction of a foundation and labor costs.\\"Historical Notes on Kit and Precut Homes,\\" Kithouse.org, accessed 28 June 2011For example, in their 1912 catalog, Sears said of their model No. 159, priced at $652: \\"By allowing a fair price for labor, cement, brick, and plaster, which we do not furnish, this house can be built for about $1171.00, including all material and labor.\\" Likewise, Sears designers estimated the total building cost of their $1248 model No. 165 to be about $2640, and so on. See Sears Homes 1908-1914 for more examples. The price of land or a city lot on which to build would be another expense. Customization In addition to their pre-cut houses, some companies also sold only the house plans (with the homebuyer purchasing all the materials locally) or non-pre-cut versions of their houses (at a lower price), leaving it up to the buyer to arrange for construction and carpentry work. According to the Sears Archives, \\"Sears actually encouraged builders of Modern Homes to save money by ordering their lumber from local lumber mills. Sears wanted Modern Homes to be cost-effective for buyers, which often meant purchasing materials locally and not from the few and geographically distant Sears lumber mills.\\"\\"Questions and Answers on Sears Homes,\\" Sears Archives, accessed 5 July 2011 Furthermore, some companies would provide reversed versions of their homes or make other modifications upon request. For example,\\"What Is a Sears Modern Home?\\" Sears Archives, accessed 5 July 2011 > Sears was ... a very able follower of popular home designs but with the > added advantage of modifying houses and hardware according to buyer tastes. > Individuals could even design their own homes and submit the blueprints to > Sears, which would then ship off the appropriate precut and fitted > materials, putting the home owner in full creative control. In addition, with some companies, homebuyers could choose the quality of materials. Gordon-Van Tine offered discounts for customers who chose lesser- quality siding, roofing, doors, windows, and trim. Sears offered \\"Honor Bilt\\" homes, with the finest quality materials, as well as \\"Standard Built\\" homes that were \\"best for warmer climates, meaning they did not retain heat very well,\\" and \\"Simplex Sectionals,\\" made from prefabricated panels that could be bolted together, intended for use as temporary structures or summer homes. Advertising 1915 magazine ad Advertisement for knocked down kits for houses, in Popular Mechanics, May 1908 Ad for the \\"2071 Einontalo\\" manufactured by the Finnish company Puutalo during the 1950s. Kit houses were promoted through catalogs available at lumber yards and hardware stores, through the mail-order catalogs published by large retailers like Sears and Wards, and through advertisements in popular magazines and newspapers in those cities where kit home manufacturers had local sales offices. Dale Wolicki lists Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and Good Housekeeping as examples of nationwide magazines where Gordon-VanTine advertised. Prospective customers could arrange to inspect kit houses in their vicinity or visit a company's factory to tour model homes. The ease of construction and cost savings of kit houses appealed to many would-be homeowners across the economic spectrum, from blue-collar workers to the affluent. For example, in 1928 Walt Disney and his brother Roy built two kit houses made by Pacific Ready Cut Homes on lots they owned in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. The popularity of kit houses was attested in a roundabout way in the 1920 silent comedy One Week starring Buster Keaton, which shows Keaton constructing a build-it-yourself house that turns out all wrong.One Week at Internet Movie Database Kit house companies A number of companies offered kit houses, and sometimes also offered rudimentary \\"industrial\\" and summer cottages lacking bathrooms, 117 House Designs of the Twenties: Gordon-Van Tine Company, reprint of 1923 catalog by Dover Publications, 1992, pp. 110–115. as well as garages, duplexes, apartment buildings, barns and other farm buildings, and even outhouses. =Canada= The largest sellers in Canada were: * Canadian Aladdin Co. Ltd. – a branch plant, of the Michigan-based Aladdin Homes, the largest kit home seller in Canada, its Canadian headquarters were located in the Canadian Pacific Building, in Toronto. They operated across the whole of Canada, from 1905 to 1952. They were truly pre-cut, and need very little skill to assemble. They also featured high-quality lumber, and the company offered a refund of $1 for each knot found in a kit. * The T. Eaton Co. Ltd. – by far the most important mail-order general retailer in Canada in the early twentieth century, it was also a provider of house kits from 1910 to 1932. They were only available in Western Canada, not in Ontario or the East. Eaton's sold at least 40 different house plans, but the most common type was the -storey, sometimes referred to as the semi-bungalow. In the 1919 and 1920 catalogues, all Eaton's houses were given a name starting in \\"Ea\\", thus, the Eatoncourt, Eastbourne, Easton, Eager, Earlswood, and Earlscourt. Although Eaton's houses were sold as kits, they were not pre-cut. * Other smaller providers of mail-order kits included The B.C. Mills Timber and Trading Co., United Grain Growers, the University of Saskatchewan, and the Manitoba Agricultural College. = United States = Over 100,000 kit homes were built in the United States between 1908 and 1940.

The 2001 census gives Windle a population of 8,621 in 3,607 households, increasing to a population of 10,690 at the 2011 Census. It borders the villages of Eccleston and Rainford. It was one of the original four townships alongside Eccleston, Parr and Sutton formed that merged to become St Helens. The name derives from Windy Hill. The Section dedicated to Windle. History Windle Chantry dates back to the 15th century, with Sir Thomas Gerard responsible for its construction on his return from Agincourt around 1415 Windhull, 1201, (and common; Wyndhill, 1320; Wyndhyll, Wyndill, Wyndell, Wyndle, 16th century) a Manor originally fell under the fee of the Warrington Barons until at least 1585. The first Baron is listed as Pain de Vilers. Vilers was disenfranchised by William de Ferrers the Earl of Derby to the benefit of William le Boteler from Warrington. The Manor was subject to contesting claims by the Vilers to no avail. Portions of Windle over the next three hundred years were divided between the families local gentry Peter de Burnhull, Alan de Windle III and Thurstan de Holand The de Burnhull family married into the Gerard family from nearby Kingsley in Cheshire who were the eventual inheritors of the land and title. Other significant families were the Colleys (or Cowleys), Hindley and Urmstons. The families of Harflynch and Eccles appear in the 16th century; and others of the neighbourhood, like the Byroms, Parrs, and Woodfalls, were also owners of land. Adam Martindale, a puritan divine, born near Mossbank in 1623, recorded daily life and events of the area in his diaries, describing the chapelry and family interactions. 18th-century Windle was originally constituted by the villages and areas of Cowley Hill, Gerards Bridge, Hardshaw, Islands Brow, Laffak, Moss Bank, Pocket Nook, Windle Ashes and Windle Smithy. Hardshaw (or antiquated Hardsheigh), described as a Berewick in the Domesday Book was the site of The Chapel of St Elyn in Chapel Lane. The modern town of St Helens was formed around the Chapel of St Elyn that was located within the Hardshaw berewick since at least the 16th century. In 1910 the area was said to cover . In Literature Windle Chantry receives a mention in literature in the poem Windleshaw Abbey by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, published in 1834. Governance Windle is one of 16 wards in the Metropolitan Borough of St Helens. Until 1834 Windle was part of the ancient West Derby hundred before becoming part of the district of the Prescot Parish and Poor Law Union (as was much of St Helens). In 1834 St Helens was established as a Sub District before becoming a charter borough in 1868. The Windle Parish was reduced as an official body in 1894 to allow for the creation of the St Helens Parish. In 1934 it was again reduced.

In its vicinity lie Laguna Colorada and Cerro del León.  Geology  = Regional = Since the late Oligocene, subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South America Plate has caused volcanism on the western edge of South America, including the formation of the Central Volcanic Zone. The crust in the Central Andes contains both an upper felsic layer and a lower mafic layer and was partly assembled from numerous terranes during the Mesoproterozoic. The most important two form the Arequipa-Antofalla crustal domain. = Local = Linzor volcano is part of the Central Volcanic Zone. The Andean Central Volcanic Zone has erupted large ignimbrites and lava flows. Dominant rocks are andesite and dacite. One part of the Central Volcanic Zone is the Altiplano- Puna volcanic complex, a system of ignimbrite sheets and lava domes that was active between 8.4 and 2.9 million years ago and is underpinned by a layer of partially molten crust. In the Linzor area, volcanism is represented by the 8.3 million years old Sifon ignimbrite, Cerro Chillahuita and Cerro Chao. Linzor and other volcanoes in the neighbourhood are constructed by breccia, lava domes, lava flows, pyroclastic flows and breccia. The volcanoes are formed by basaltic andesite, andesite and dacite. Pyroxene andesite is the dominant component. The volcanoes are constructed on top of Miocene ignimbrites and are of Pleistocene-Holocene age. An Inca sanctuary has been found on Linzor. Linzor is part of a north-south trending volcanic chain with San Pedro volcano which was heavily glaciated in the past. This chain is parallel to several Paleozoic faults in the region. The Rio Toconce, a tributary of the Rio Salado and ultimately of the Loa River, originates at the foot of Linzor.

The bulk of her combat career was served in this capacity. She was laid down on 20 November 1918 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard; launched on 26 May 1919; sponsored by Mrs. E. S. Robert; and commissioned on 16 October 1919, Lt. Ernest R. Peircey in command.  Post World War I operations  Vireo was assigned to the Train, Atlantic Fleet, and operated along the U.S. East Coast until departing Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 January 1920 to join the Fleet for its annual winter maneuvers in Cuban waters. She arrived back in Norfolk on 28 April and was reclassified AM-52 on 17 July 1920.  East Coast service  In the following years, while some of her sisterships were decommissioned and laid up in reserve, Vireo continued in active service with the Fleet. From 1920 to 1932, she served off the U.S. East Coast engaged in towing targets; transporting men, mail, and materiel; repairing buoys and beacons; and operating with the Atlantic and Scouting Fleets. In July 1921, she towed several former German warships to sea off the Virginia Capes, where they were sunk by aircraft in attempts to prove that capital ships were vulnerable to attack from the air. Between December 1930 and March 1931, Vireo served as plane guard for aircraft engaged in supporting the Nicaraguan-Puerto Rican aerial survey.  Transferred to the Pacific Fleet  Late in 1931, Vireo received orders assigning her to the U.S. Pacific Fleet and duty with the Train, Base Force. Departing Norfolk on 2 January 1932, Vireo steamed—via Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal—to the U.S. West Coast, arriving at San Pedro, California, on 6 March. Attached to the Pacific Fleet's Train, the minesweeper continued her Fleet support duties and ranged the Pacific from the California coast to Panama and the Hawaiian Islands. With the emergence of an intransigent Japan and a tense Far Eastern situation, the focus of American Fleet operations shifted westward to Hawaii; and Vireo departed San Francisco, California, on 10 November 1940, bound for Pearl Harbor. Soon after reaching Hawaiian waters, she commenced operations out of Pearl Harbor, towing target rafts, conducting minesweeping exercises, and performing towing service to some of the outlying islands of the Hawaiian group, including Palmyra Island and Johnston Island. From 5 September to 7 October 1941, Vireo underwent a navy yard overhaul at the Mare Island Navy Yard before heading westward once again. On 7 December 1941, Vireo lay in a nest of her sisterships at the coal docks at Pearl Harbor, which included , , and . Shortly before 0800 that morning, Japanese aircraft roared overhead. The marauders swept over the Fleet's base and devastated not only Pearl Harbor, but outlying Army and Navy installations all over the island of Oahu. In upkeep status, with her engines dismantled, Vireo nevertheless speedily entered the fight. While her gunners topside fought their mounts coolly and efficiently, the \\"black gang\\" below decks assembled the ship's engines and fired up the boilers to get underway. Her 3-inch guns expended some 22 rounds, and the men at her number 2 mount rejoiced when one of their shells exploded directly in the path of a Japanese bomber, causing the Japanese plane to crash in a ball of fire. Vireo and some of her sister sweepers at Pearl Harbor received orders to assist the stricken , sinking into the oil-stained ooze at berth F-3, off Ford Island. While engaged in salvage operations alongside California, through January 1942, Vireo also served briefly as a tender to . The minesweeper carried ammunition to replenish \\"Big E's\\" depleted magazines and prepare that ship for future forays against the Japanese empire. = Hawaiian area operations = After conducting minesweeping operations in the Pearl Harbor channel and other Hawaiian waters, Vireo underwent upkeep at Pearl Harbor between 10 and 13 February 1942. Following local operations near Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, she made brief runs to Johnston Island and the port of Hilo. In April and May 1942, after another brief stretch around Pearl Harbor, Vireo conducted local patrols out of Hilo, sometimes in company with to conduct magnetic, acoustic, and mechanical minesweeping operations; and to patrol harbors with her echo- ranging and listening gear. From 23 to 24 April, Vireo, in company with Crossbill and , conducted a search for survivors of a downed Army plane off Pepeekeo Point, near Hilo, and found one body before she abandoned the task. Service as Fleet Tug On 28 May 1942, under secret orders, Vireo and gasoline tanker departed Honolulu and headed for Midway Island. During the voyage, Vireo was reclassified as an ocean-going tug and redesignated AT-144 on 1 June 1942. While Vireo and her charge crept toward Midway at nine knots, two battle fleets steamed toward each other on a collision course. The American and Japanese Navies were squaring off for the decisive Battle of Midway. Vireo and Kaloli hove to in Midway harbor on 3 June, amidst preparations there for defense of the island. Soon after the two American ships arrived, they received orders to proceed to a point 30 miles off Pearl and Hermes Reef, where they were to await further orders. Underway by 1910, Vireo and the gasoline tanker soon arrived at their assigned stations and lay to. = The Battle of Midway = Air action the following day, 4 June 1942, was intense. Japanese carriers Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, and Hiryu were all crippled and sunk by American planes. However, American carrier became the unfortunate victim of Japanese dive and torpedo bombers which heavily damaged the carrier, stopping her dead in the water, and forcing a severe list. = Vireo takes Yorktown in tow = Lest the ship capsize before the crew could be removed, Capt. Elliot Buckmaster ordered Yorktown abandoned. When Yorktown stopped settling, Buckmaster concluded that the ship could possibly be saved. Accordingly, Vireo received a summons to take Yorktown in tow. The tug arrived on the scene by 1135 on 5 June and closed and maneuvered to pass Yorktown a towline, accomplishing this by 1308. Vireo and her unwieldy charge then labored painfully ahead, at a speed of under 3 knots, with a protective brood of destroyers standing by. Vireo, hampered by a small rudder and inadequate engines for such a large tow, found itself confronted with the Herculean task of keeping the big carrier pointed into the wind and on course. The next day, secured alongside Yorktown to assist the salvage parties on the larger ship working to correct her trim and to repair her battle damage. Around 1400 on 6 June, Japanese submarine I-168 fired torpedoes at the nearly helpless targets. Hammann, mortally hit, broke in two and sank alongside the towering carrier, which also took two torpedoes. As the destroyer sank, her depth charges all went off at once, causing tremendous shock waves which convulsed swimmers in the water and violently wrenched the old tug. Vireo freed herself from the carrier by cutting the towing cable with an acetylene torch and then doubled back to commence rescue operations. Up her sides clambered carriermen and destroyermen alike, while she maneuvered near the carrier's canting stern to take on board members of the salvage party who had chosen to abandon the carrier from there. She then proceeded to secure alongside the wounded flattop in the exact spot where Hammann had met her doom. Yorktown rolled heavily, her heavy steel hide pounding the lighter former minecraft's hull with a vengeance as the ships touched time and time again during the rescue operations. This mission completed, battered Vireo stood away from the sinking carrier, which sank shortly after dawn on the 7th. Vireo's troubles, however, had only begun. Underwater explosions from Hammann's depth charges had severely jostled the tug's rudder. As a result, it jammed as Vireo was entering the shipping channel at Midway harbor on 8 June, and she ran aground on a coral head, carrying away her echo-ranging gear and flooding her sound room. Repeated attempts to free herself only resulted in another grounding, so Vireo lay-to and called for a tow. After arriving at Midway Island at the end of a towline from YMT-12, following another brush with a coral head which irreparably damaged the rudder, Vireo soon got underway for Pearl Harbor, this time behind . Reaching Hawaiian waters on 17 June, she entered the navy yard at Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs which lasted from 18 to 30 June. Following this, she remained at the Pearl Harbor yard for a complete overhaul and drydocking. = Converted into a tow ship and sent to Fiji = Vireo (AT-144) at Pearl Harbor, 20 August 1942. Having concluded the refitting by 19 August, Vireo conducted post-repair trials before turning in all her mine gear on 25 August. Two days later, she got underway to escort SS Gulf Queen to the Fiji Islands, towing two barges. Upon her arrival at Suva on 11 September, the tug refueled, provisioned, and carried out minor repairs before heading for New Caledonia on 15 September. After arriving at Noumea five days later, on 20 September 1942, she commenced harbor operations under the control of Commander, Amphibious Forces, South Pacific (AmphibForSoPac). In accordance with verbal orders from ComAmphibForSoPac, Vireo's crew set about making camouflage nets and painting the ship green in preparation for her next assignment. = Guadalcanal operations = Arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 October, she awaited further orders, spending four days at this port in the New Hebrides before setting out for the Guadalcanal area on 12 October, to take part in resupply operations for the U.S. Marines at Henderson Field. Since the initial landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August 1942, the campaign had been fought tooth and nail. Fierce land and sea battles had characterized the fighting since the early going. By this juncture, American aviation operations on Henderson Field had been so endangered by shellings, bad weather, and inadequate supplies, that the American situation was extreme. With American aircraft using up gasoline at an alarming rate, that commodity ranked high on the list of priority supplies. Accordingly, a barge-towing operation was mounted in mid-October to ease the critical fuel situation on Guadalcanal. The force to carry out this operation comprised , , , , , and Vireo, each pulling a barge carrying barrels of gasoline and quarter-ton bombs. Setting out from Espiritu Santo, the highly volatile convoy was spotted by Japanese aircraft on 15 October. All but Vireo and Meredith beat a hasty retreat. Cautiously proceeding, the pair beat off a two-plane Japanese attack before they received word that Japanese surface ships were in the area. Only then did they reverse course. At noon, Meredith ordered old, slow, and vulnerable Vireo abandoned and took off her crew. Meredith then stood off to torpedo the tug at 1215 so that she would not fall into enemy hands intact. Suddenly, a whirlwind of destruction swept down from the sky and descended upon the destroyer. Like hawks, 38 planes from the Japanese carrier Zuikaku pounced on Meredith and deluged her with bombs, torpedoes, and bullets, sinking her in about 15 minutes. Vireo and the two gasoline barges, however, drifted to leeward, untouched. One life raft, crammed with some of Meredith's survivors, succeeded in overhauling the derelict tug and the men gratefully scrambled aboard. The barges and the tug were later found intact by a PBY naval scout plane which rescued six of the Meredith's crew. When a salvage party boarded Vireo on 21 October, the ship was dead in the water with no lights, no steam, and no power. After abortive attempts to light fires under the boilers, using wood, the tug had to be taken under tow by . In company with Grayson and , Vireo arrived safely at Espiritu Santo on 23 October. With a new crew—the majority of her old complement lost in the ordeal with Meredith—she continued to operate in the Guadalcanal area with Task Force 62. She conducted resupply operations to Guadalcanal, towing barges loaded with precious gasoline and bombs and carrying out local escort for other, larger ships, engaged in the same vital duties. On 3 December, in company with and towing PT-boats, she departed Nouméa and proceeded to Australia. Arriving at Cairns on 9 December, she spent the remainder of the year there, enjoying Christmas and New Year's Day in Australian waters before heading back to the combat area, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 9 January. = Return to Guadalcanal operations = Operating out of the New Hebrides in early January, she assisted cruisers and as they underwent repairs following damage received at Tassafaronga. Towing barges and firing target bursts for destroyers during gunnery practice off Guadalcanal, the tug continued her operations as before, between that island and Espiritu Santo and Nouméa. It was dull and monotonous duty but necessary and vital, nonetheless. In April 1943, as American forces advanced on the \\"island-hopping\\", \\"leap-frogging\\" campaigns against the Japanese in the South Pacific, Japanese Admiral Yamamoto initiated operation \\"I.\\" Yamamoto aimed this stroke at Papua, in the hope of compensating for the loss of Guadalcanal, by destroying the American advance base there and thus slowing or stopping the Allied advance. The new Japanese thrust began on 7 April when large formations of Japanese planes swept down from Rabaul to attack American shipping in Lunga Roads between Guadalcanal and Tulagi. Among these ships, there lay Vireo, engaged in her usual harbor activities. Pathfinder was engaged in taking soundings; also near were and SC-521. Shortly before the attack came, passed by, escorting LST-U9. Three Japanese dive bombers swooped down out of the sun and severely damaged the destroyer with their lethal loads. Ortolan and Vireo took the crippled Aaron Ward under tow, but the destroyer sank three miles short of Tulagi. = The Battle of Kula Gulf = As the New Georgia campaign got underway and American forces advanced further up the chain of islands in the southwest Pacific, Vireo continued her operations out of Tulagi, Espiritu Santo, or Nouméa. In the pre-dawn darkness of 13 July, the Battle of Kula Gulf was fought between Japanese and American surface forces, the latter augmented by New Zealand cruiser Leander. In the action which followed, , , and Leander were damaged. Later that day, Vireo, in company with set out to assist in getting the cripples home and towed Honolulu to haven at government wharf, Tulagi, where temporary repairs to the cruiser's bow were made. Second reclassification For the remainder of 1943 and on into 1944, Vireo followed the Fleet as it inched closer to Japan. In the rearward island areas, she continued her duties as a harbor tug and local escort vessel. On 15 May 1944, Vireo was reclassified as an ocean-going tug, old, and redesignated ATO-144. In late July, American forces struck in northwestern New Guinea at Cape Sansapor. Vireo took part in these operations from 30 July to 2 August, engaged in the vital support activities necessary to support the successful landings. = Supporting the Philippine invasion = After service in the South Pacific Ocean, the old tug moved northward with the invasion armada to liberate the Philippine Islands from the Japanese. On 18 October 1944, American troops stormed ashore on Leyte, keeping General Mac Arthur's promise to return to Philippine soil. Vireo operated in support of these landings into December. She departed Morotai on the 10th, bound for Biak. From there, she proceeded to Leyte, engaged in towing duties. = Supporting Okinawa invasion = Next—after touching at Hollandia, Manus, and Biak—she took part in the Okinawa operations in April and May 1945. Returning to Morotai, she engaged in towing operations again, this time to Tacloban on the island of Leyte, departing there on 25 May for Subic Bay. For the remainder of the war, she operated between the Philippine Islands and New Guinea, as American forces continued to sweep northward towards the Japanese home islands. = End-of-war operations = On 20 December 1945, after immediate postwar towing operations at Manila, Luzon, and Samar, she departed Philippine waters on 20 December 1945, in company with and , and headed for the Marshalls. Following a brief stay at Eniwetok, Vireo got underway on 4 January 1946 and proceeded via Pearl Harbor to the west coast. She arrived at San Francisco, California, on 5 February and reported to the Commandant, 12th Naval District, for disposition.  Decommissioned  As newer and more powerful fleet tugs supplanted the old converted minesweepers, the need for the old vessels decreased. Thus, on 18 April 1946, Vireo was decommissioned, declared surplus to Navy needs, and made available for disposal. Struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946, Vireo was transferred from the Maritime Commission for disposal on 4 February 1947; but no records of her subsequent fate have survived. However, the Sasaulito News on February 13, 1947 reported that the Vireo had arrived at the Arques Shipyard in Sausalito to be painted in preparation for impending service as Panamanian-flagged lumber boat carrying hardwoods between Long Beach and Panama.  Military awards and honors  Vireo received seven battle stars for her World War II service.
