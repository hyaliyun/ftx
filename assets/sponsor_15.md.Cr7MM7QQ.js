It was built from 1916 to 1918. It is also known as Esslemont. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Egglemont was built in / 1918 in the Californian Bungalow style with a garden typical of that period. It is a four bedroom house. In latter years the property was owned by property developer Michael and Kimberley McGurk. Michael McGurk was murdered outside the property in September 2009. The property was sold in October 2011.The Sydney Morning Herald, 2011.  Description  =Site= Egglemont relates well to the adjacent house by Alexander Stuart Jolly and to other houses in the Cranbrook Avenue group. It is a significant element of the Cranbrook Avenue Group, relating well to the adjacent house by A. S. Jolly and other houses in the group. The area has unfortunately been degraded in the 1970s by red brick multi-storey flat developments.Branch Manager's report, November 2003 The house is sited on a sloping site on Cranbrook Avenue, Cremorne, with a low, stepped wall (plastered masonry) facing the footpath, stone walls flanking a low wide paired \\"wide lattice\\" form timber gate and crazy-paved sandstone path to the front door, large shrubs (Viburnum odoratissimum, pruned into a hedge) providing some screening from the street. To either side of the main pedestrian entry gate the name \\"Esslemont\\" is carved into the top course of sandstone boundary wall blocks.Stuart Read, from photographs, May 2012 A crazy paved sandstone pedestrian path approaches the front door, which is accessed up a flight of wide stairs. Planter beds are at the base of the stairs, and abut the base of the house's walls. A secondary pedestrian gate (Art Deco iron, flanked by stone pillars) is on the uphill side of the house. It abuts, (on its uphill side again) a paved tennis court and high (steel pipe and wire netting) fence which runs up to the house and to the street wall. At the rear of the tennis court fence is a lawn area and an outbuilding (a single garage) with a sloping roof, abutting the uphill side boundary. On the uphill side of the tennis court are a multi-storey late-mid-20th century block of flats (Rosz & Howard et al., 2001 photographs). As well as the tennis court the property has a swimming pool.Sydney Morning Herald, 8‚Äì9 October 2011 At the rear of the house is a small flat lawn area with shrubs and a ground cover of cast-iron plant (Aspidistra elatior) up against the house's rear wall. The garden contains an elevated tennis court. To the back of the house is a three- storey red brick mid-20th century block of flats. The garden is typical of the period.RNE, 1991. =House= The house was built -18 and is one of the best examples of an early Californian Bungalow style house in Australia. IThe proportions, materials and craftsmanship are typical of the early examples of the style. The house is large and contains a billiard room, large sunroom, dressing room and ensuite bathroom to the main bedroom, kitchen, laundry and scullery configured for use by domestic staff. The house is little altered in the past 60 years with the exception of extension of Bedroom 3 into the northern verandah and kitchen cupboards installed in the 1960s. The laundry contains early (probably original) china laundry double tubs and pedestals and a copper and finishes (photo 41), which are to be removed.Branch Manager's IDA report, May 2001 It comprises a large and low set single storey residence (c.1916/ 1918) in Californian Bungalow style. It has a low pitched spreading roof and gables supported on heavy timber beams, with small leadlight windows above rough dressed stone walls and massive circular verandah piers. The house has four bedrooms on . The original laundry was in the southwestern corner of the house.Rosz & Howard et al, 2001 = Modifications and dates = * - Leighton's Green' hybrid cypress (x Cuprocyparis leylandii 'Leighton's Green') hedge planted on boundary facing 13 Cranbrook Avenue - a block of flats. *2011 - NSW Land & Environment Court Tree Dispute application over the above hedge from the Strata Title flat neighbours.

However, the purpose of the line was to increase land prices in the area, and it soon closed during the depression in 1890. The first genuine attempt to construct a tramway network was the construction of the Richmond cable tram line by the Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company in 1885. Over the next few years, 16 more cable tram lines were constructed, as well as numerous other horse tramways. The depression of the early 1890s slowed further expansion of the cable network. The first electric tram line was the Box Hill and Doncaster tramway which opened in 1889. This was a pioneering line in what was then the countryside and thus didn't receive much patronage. It closed in 1896. The next attempt at an electric tramway was Victorian Railways' St Kilda to Brighton line, which opened in 1906. Later that year, the North Melbourne Electric Tramway and Lighting Company opened lines to Essendon and Maribyrnong. Many local councils formed their own tramway trusts and built tramways within their own constituency. The most successful of these was the Prahran and Malvern Tramway Trust. Consolidation of all of the systems occurred with the forming of the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board in 1920, who eventually took control of all lines except for the two Victorian Railways lines. The MMTB continued the expansion of the electric tramways and began the process of electrifying the cable network, which began in earnest by the mid-1920s. Though many more lines were planned, the Great Depression and World War II slowed the process of construction. The electrification of the cable network was effectively completed by 1956 with the opening of the Bourke Street lines. However, by this time, the increasing popularity of the motor vehicle and the anti-tram Bolte government prevented any expansion in the following years, and overall patronage began to decline. The VR closed its two lines and the MMTB also closed many of its shorter, more marginal routes. The decades following the late 1970s saw the expansion of tram lines to outer suburbs such as Bundoora, Vermont South, Airport West, and Box Hill. Establishment of a state-run corporation to operate Melbourne's tram network occurred in 1983. In 1997, the tram network was split into two and later privatized. Since 2004, Yarra Trams has been the sole operator of the Melbourne Tram Network.

In retail settings, especially shopping malls, these often include percentage rent and various recoverable expenses. Additional rent items are used in almost all commercial leases to deal with costs that are shared by multiple tenants. For instance, in a shopping mall the cost of cleaning the common areas, paying real estate taxes or repaving the parking lot is normally shared among all of the tenants. The total cost is generally divided out based on the individual tenant's \\"proportionate share\\", typically calculated by dividing the tenant's leased square footage by the total area of the building. Sub-areas are also common for handling costs shared among a sub-group of tenants, like cleaning a food court which is generally more expensive and shared among a smaller group.

Charles Le Noir or Lenoir (first active 1618; died 9 August 1637) was a French actor-manager, who was a member of the troupe of the Prince of Orange from at least 1622, sometimes named as a co-founder with the actor Montdory of the Th√©√¢tre du Marais in 1634, and a member of the Troupe Royale at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne from 1634 to 1637.Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 114. Life The first record of Charles Le Noir shows he was the leader of a troupe in Bordeaux in 1618.Forman 2010, p. 152. He then appears as the leader of a troupe in Lille in 1620.Lefebvre 1907, p. 141; cited by Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 114. Le Noir and Montdory were both members of the troupe of the Prince of Orange at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne in Paris in July and August 1622.Wiley 1960, p. 101; Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 114. The Prince of Orange died in 1625, but the company continued to perform under his name, appearing regularly in alternation with the troupe of Robert Gu√©rin at the Bourgogne.Wiley 1960, p. 102; Howe 2006, p. 522. According to W. L. Wiley, Montdory joined a different troupe in April 1624.Wiley 1960, pp. 101‚Äì102 Le Noir was in the cast, when the company presented Pierre Corneille's first play, M√©lite, in Paris around 1629 to 1630. The play may have been presented at the Bourgogne before it was given at the jeu de paume de Berthault, located on the cul-de-sac Beaubourg, where Montdory rejoined the company.Howe 2006, pp. 521‚Äì524. Le Noir also appeared in their production of Corneille's Clitandre (1630‚Äì1631).Howe 2006, p. 541. From 15 December 1631, the company began performing at the tennis court known as La Sph√®re, located on the rue Vieille-du-Temple,Howe 2006, p. 521. and on 10 February 1632, Le Noir and his troupe were sentenced at the Ch√¢telet and required to pay a fine of 405 livres for having given 120 performances at the Berthault.Mongr√©dien 1972, p. 114; Souli√© 1863, p. 163. After about three months at La Sph√®re, the company moved to yet another tennis court, La Fontaine, on the rue Michel-le-Comte, where they were to remain for two years. During this period Le Noir appeared in other plays by Corneille, including, La Veuve (1632‚Äì1633), La Galerie du Palais (1632‚Äì1633), La Suivante (1633‚Äì1634), La Place royale (1633‚Äì1634), and possibly M√©d√©e (1634‚Äì1635).Howe 2006, p. 542. On 8 March 1634 the troupe leased a jeu de paume on the rue Vieille-du-Temple with a sign on it reading \\"Les Marestz\\", which was soon to be their permanent home and eventually become known as the Th√©√¢tre du Marais.Wiley 1960, p. 171. According to Deierkauf-Holsboer, the theatre's opening and founding occurred on 1 April 1634.Deierkauf-Holsboer 1954, p. 32. Soon, however, Le Noir would have to leave the troupe: according to the Gazette de France of 30 November 1634, King Louis XIII transferred Le Noir along with 5 other actors: L'Espy, Jodelet, Jaqueman Jadot, Alizon, and Mlle Le Noir (Isabelle Mestivier), to the company of Bellerose at the Bourgogne.Howarth 1997, p. 103. Very little is known about Le Noir's career during his time there.Hartnoll 1983, p. 482. Charles Le Noir married the actress Isabelle Mestivier, and they had five children, including the actor Fran√ßois Le Noir.Mongr√©dien 1972, pp. 114‚Äì115; Deierkauf-Holsboer 1970, p. 150. According to Mongr√©dien, she is also called Fran√ßoise or Elisabeth. Her father, Fran√ßois Mestivier, was a member of the troupe of the Prince of Orange from at least 1622 until the end of 1634.Deierkauf-Holsboer 1954, pp. 19, 43.

It was designed by Alexander Stewart Jolly. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Built 1919 for grazier C. H. Stockman, who specified broad eaves and wide verandahs and generous proportions for the plan. The architect, Alexander Stewart Jolly, was a prominent and unorthodox architect influenced by a love and knowledge of timber, the Californian Bungalow movement and American \\"organic\\" architecture.LEP, 1989  Description  The house is an excellent example of the larger more mature Californian bungalow, and has all the typical elements of the larger more mature Californian bungalow style: planes of white rough-cast, areas of timber shingles, massive dark stained timber beams and low pitched, wide, sheltering eaves. There is a fine wide verandah with polished timber floor and stained timber beams to the roof. The front door is recessed between two heavy rough- cast piers which extend to, but do not support the gable overhand. The roof, which is an interesting interplay of planes, is formed of both hipped and gabled sections covered with slate. Jolly specialised in gadgets, and this house has a unique rotating cupboard between the kitchen and dining room. The whole house is in excellent condition. This building is designed in the Inter- War California Bungalow style. Single storey residence of Interwar California bungalow style. A vigorous and assured interpretation of the Californian bungalow; with deep overhanging roofs, dynamic asymmetry and cleverly exposed structural timbers.RAIA, 1979. The California Bungalow was one of the most successful importations brought to Australian architecture and both Belvedere and Egglemont (11 Cranbrook Avenue) are impressive examples of this style of architecture. The bungalows are prominently located on the brow of a hill and have fine city views. Belvedere has wide verandahs to remind the client of his country home. The front door is recessed behind 2 heavy rough-cast piers which extend to the roof overhang. The roof, in turn, comprises hipped and gabled sections covered with slate. The bungalow incorporates planes of white rough- cast, areas of timber shingles, massive dark stained timber beams and low sheltering eaves. The front garden wall and gate continues the theme of rough- cast piers of the bungalow itself.Heritage Branch, Branch Manager's Report no.26/84, 26/1/1984  Heritage listing  As at 8 November 2007, see also under \\"Cranbrook Avenue Group\\" NSHS#1052. The house is generally regarded as one of the finest individual California Bungalow designs in NSW, described by J. M. Freeland as \\"an eloquent sculptural statement\\" which \\"anticipated later domestic work by nearly half a century\\". The RAIA regards it as \\"the best work of a highly individual designer\\" (architect Alexander Stuart Jolly).LEP, 1989.

Lucien Chauvi√®re was born in Paris on 11 February 1876. and educated at Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech in Angers, where his studies included the theory of propeller design. He became a member of the Aero-Club de France in December 1906, sponsored by the engineer Andre Farcot. The same month he exhibited an apparatus designed to investigate the stability of helicopters at the Aero-Club's exhibit at the annual Salon d'Automobile. In 1908 he made a diameter laminated wooden propeller for the Cl√©ment-Bayard No.1 semi-rigid airship, which broke the existing speed record for airships. He was also responsible for the construction of a number of heavier-than-air aircraft, some to his own design and some designed by others, including the Alfred de Pischoff biplane of 1907 and the Clement-Bayard monoplane of 1909 designed by Victor Tatin He later established a factory at Quai Jules Guesde in the Vitry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris. A Chauvi√®re propeller was fitted to the aircraft used by Louis Bl√©riot to make the first heavier-than-air flight across the English Channel. Following the success of his first propellers, Chauvi√®re opened factories in France, Germany and Russia. Many of the pioneer aircraft constructors used his propellers, not simply because of their quality but also because they were available off the shelf from a large stock. Several hundred were made during 1910. In 1913 he produced an experimental variable- pitch propeller, which was fitted to the Clement-Bayard VI airship. Over 100,000 Chauvi√®re propellers were built for allied aircraft during the First World War, around 25% of total production. After the war Chauvi√®re carried out pioneering work in the construction of metal propellers, particularly the use of forged duralumin, and also worked on the development of variable-pitch propellers.\\"Some Aviation Accessories\\". Flight, 5 July 1913. A Chauvi√®re metal propeller was fitted to the Bl√©riot 110 monoplane flown by Lucien Bossoutrot and Maurice Rossi to break the world endurance record in March 1931. The Integrale The success of Chauvi√®re's propellers was due to both aerodynamic sophistication and careful construction. Previous wooden propellers had been carved from a single piece of timber. The Integrale introduced a new technique, constructing the propeller from a number of laminated planks. This had several advantages: *The density of a length of wood can vary considerably along its length, the part coming from the lower part of the trunk tending to be denser. It is of great importance to balance a propeller about its axis of rotation: even a slight imbalance will result in potentially catastrophic vibration. Careful selection of the lengths of wood used eliminated this problem. *Since the pieces of wood were thinner, less allowance had to be made for concealed flaws within the wood. This enabled the propellers to be up to 25% lighter. *The layers of wood were assembled in a fanned arrangement. This partially established the form of the propeller, reducing the amount of carving necessary and also reducing the amount of waste.

Early life Jadunath Sinha was born in Kurumgram in Birbhum, West Bengal in 1892. Later he lived in Murshidabad and Kolkata (then Calcutta). Jadunath Sinha came from a Shakta family. So, Sinha had spiritual experiences throughout his life. He followed both classical tantra and emotional Shakta bhakti, with a philosophical position of Shakta universalism. Academic career Jadunath Sinha had passed B.A., Honours in Philosophy in 1915 from the Calcutta University and simultaneously bagging the Philip Samuel Smith Prize and the Clint Memorial Prize. Subsequently, he passed the M.A. on Philosophy from the Calcutta University in 1917. He did his PhD from the Calcutta University in 1934. He went on to become a versatile writer of Philosophy, Psychology etc. which were published by famous publishers. Two of his books were published by M/s. Kegan Paul of London. Dr. Sinha being the most original philosopher of Hinduism and Indian philosophy, psychology, etc. is still revered by the students of philosophy. He went into religion in the latter part of his life. Sinha has been cited as one of the early contributors to the field of Indian psychology that began to emerge more strongly in the 21st century.  Controversy with Radhakrishnan  In the January 1929 issue of Modern Review, the Bengali philosopher Jadunath Sinha made the sensational claim that parts of his doctoral thesis, Indian Psychology of Perception, published in 1925, were copied by his teacher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan into his book Indian Philosophy II, published in 1927. The controversy continued into the February, March and April issues of the magazine. In August 1929, Sinha filed a case in the Calcutta High Court, against Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan for infringement of his copyrights. Sinha claimed damages for Rs 20,000. Radhakrishnan denied these claims and pointed out that manuscript of his book had been sent to publisher in 1924, but it was published after 3 years as the General Editor Muirhead was in the US. Radhakrishnan counter-sued for defamation of character, demanding Rs 100,000 from Sinha and the editor of Modern Review, Ramananda Chattopadhyay. Sinha's case was strong as many of his articles were already published. However, the parties found the cost of litigation very high. Henceforth the member of Bengal Legislative Council from Calcutta University, Syama Prasad Mookerjee mediated between them to settle the issue out of court. The suits were settled in May 1933, the terms of the settlement were not disclosed and the allegations made in the pleadings were withdrawn.

The book is about the process of state capture and corruption within the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, how it grew and efforts made by the government to fight it.  Background and synopsis  In the book Olver alleges that the metro's government was controlled by a criminal syndicate closely associated with the African National Congress (ANC). The book details how the syndicate had built a sophisticated network of front companies, improper tenders, and a network of corrupt local officials that the syndicate used to steal large amounts of public money from local government. The book concludes that the corruption, political divisions, and political disenchantment that the situation created led to the ANC's losing the municipality in the 2016 municipal elections, despite the region's being an ANC political stronghold in the past.

It was built in 1889 in the Victorian Free Classical architectural style by architect W. H. Monckton, and was officially opened on 11 April 1889 by the Prime Minister of New South Wales, Sir Henry Parkes. The Town Hall was the seat of Canterbury Municipal Council from 1889 to 1963. When the council moved to a new purpose-built administration centre on Beamish Street in Campsie, a recognition of the change in economic importance of Campsie, the town hall was quickly disposed of by Council and demolished, being replaced by a service station. Today the Town Hall site's is part derelict and part paint shop. History Sketch in Australian Town and Country Journal, 27 April 1889. With the proclamation of the Municipality of Canterbury in March 1879, the new council turned its attention to acquiring land for a purpose-built chambers and hall for their work. However, with disputes over the specific site dragging out the process, it was not until 1887 when council eventually chose a site. A plot in Canterbury on Canterbury Road, bounded by Canton and Howard Streets, owned by Alderman John Campbell Sharp was acquired and council resolved on 7 December 1887 to move for construction of a town hall on the site. The architect chosen, Walter Hillary Monckton of Parramatta, designed a Victorian Free Classical building with a two-storey frontage and a central tower, and tenders for construction were advertised by mid-1888. The tender of builder A. M. Allen of Summer Hill for ¬£2307 was accepted in June 1888 and construction began. The completed Town Hall was composed of brick, cemented on stone foundations, topped by a 60-foot (19m) high tower, and the words \\"J. C. Sharp, Mayor.\\" inscribed over the entrance. The building contained a small library, council clerk's offices, a public hall, and a council chamber. Provision was made to place a clock within the tower, but was never carried out. Completed less than a year after construction began, the hall was officially opened on 11 April 1889 by the NSW Premier, Sir Henry Parkes. Later history In 1942, the main hall was converted into municipal offices, and later additions were created to the rear of the original building. However, even in the late 1940s, the council was aware of the need for more office space for the growing council staff. Council had unsuccessfully applied for special loans for the purpose of a new \\"Civic Centre\\" in 1947 and 1949 and Davey & Brindley, architects, had prepared plans along the lines of Dudok's Hilversum Town Hall. Council's occupation continued in the Town Hall until 1962, when Council decided to construct a new administration centre at 137 Beamish Street, Campsie, adjacent to the 1958 Library and 1954 Baby Health Centre. The last Council meeting at the Town Hall was held on 22 August 1963, and the new Campsie Administration Building was opened on 21 September 1963. The building was soon after sold and demolished to make way for blocks of flats and a service station. A sign on Canterbury Road marking the site of the former Town Hall was unveiled by the Mayor of Canterbury, Kayee Griffin, on 29 April 1998.

Life  Born in Lourdes, Tisn√© began his musical studies at the Tarbes Conservatory. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1952 in a music writing class. He was then a student of Georges Hugon in harmony and No√´l Gallon and Jean Rivier in fugue and counterpoint, then had Darius Milhaud and Andr√© Jolivet as his teachers. He won a Second Grand Prix de Rome in 1962. Principal music inspector at the Ministry of Cultural Affairs between 1967 and 1992, then music inspector in charge of the municipal conservatories of the City of Paris, Tisn√© composed more than three hundred works ranging from pieces for solo instrument to the symphony orchestra. His works are recorded in France by MFA, REM, Calliope. He was an Officer of the National Order of Merit, a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des LettresArchives of the ordre des Arts et des Lettres. and was decorated with the Ordre des Palmes acad√©miques. Among other awards, he has received the Copley Foundation Prize, the Helphen Prize, the Lili Boulanger Prize, the Koussevitsky Foundation Prize, the Casa de Vel√°zquez Prize, the Grand Prix musical de la Ville de Paris, the Composers' Prize of the SACEM. Tisn√©'s work is that of a humanist for whom composition procedures are only a tool intended to restore as well as possible the explorations of his imagination without ever being in itself the essential generator of the composed works. New technologies, while he knew how to appreciate them, do not fit into his thought pattern as a deliberate substitute for inspiration or as an alternative to a musical discourse that he likes to be imbued with spirituality. Tisn√©'s work is resolutely expressive and does not need to be followed, at the time of its interpretation, by explanatory comments.Interview with Antoine Tisn√© One enters the universe of Tisn√© as on enters the universe of a painter or even more perhaps in the universe of an architect by its spatial dimension and by its quasi-telluric energy. Tisn√© was a musician of spaces. These spaces or fields ignore emptiness; they are spiritually, emotionally, historically charged, whether real or purely dreamlike, if only because on can define in this abundance the solution of continuity between the real and the unreal. But his world is also our world.Antoine Tisn√© Tisn√© died in Paris in 1998.

Originally, they formed a confederation of cities, but, in later times, it seems that they were organized in three dominions: North, South and Serran. Its economy was agricultural and commercial. They had large urban centers such as: El Taj√≠n (300‚Äì1200), which represents the height of the Totonac culture, Papantla (900‚Äì1519) and Cempoala (900‚Äì1519). The three centers or three hearts of their culture stand out for the very varied ceramics, the stone sculpture, the monumental architecture and advanced urban conception of the cities. Advances and perfection of forms achieved in the production of yokes, palms, axes, snakes, smiley faces and monumental mud sculptures are admirable.  Toponimia  According to the Dictionary of the Nahuatl or Mexican Language, the term totonaca is the plural of totonacatl and refers to the inhabitants of the province of Totonacapan. Some authors have pointed out that the term \\"totonaco\\" means \\"man of hot earth\\". In the Totonac language this word is composed by the terms tu'tu or a'ktu'tu referring to the number \\"three\\" and nacu \\"meaning\\" heart \\". The Totonacs use this term in the sense that Cempoala, Taj√≠n and the Castillo de Teayo are the three representative centers of the group;  History  Ruins at El Taj√≠n The ancient Totonacs developed in the central part of Veracruz and towards the Late Classic period, their occupational area reached south to the Papaloapan River basin, west to the municipalities of Acatl√°n state of Oaxaca, Chalchicomula state of Puebla, the Perote Valley, the mountains of Puebla and Papantla and the lowlands of the Cazones River. The most relevant of the Totonac culture was reached during the Late Classic when they built ceremonial centers such as El Taj√≠n, Yohualich√°n, Nepatecuhtl√°n, Las Higueras, Nopiloa and Zapotal. This area is known as the Totonacapan, the suffix Nahuatl -pan (over) refers to \\"place\\" or \\"land\\". View of the main square of the ruins of the city of Cempoala, capital of the Totonac Nation, the first to establish a military alliance with the Castilian hosts to attack the dominions of the Triple Alliance or ƒíxcƒÅn Tlahtol≈çyƒÅn. In 1519 a meeting took place among 30 Totonac towns in the City of Cempoala. This would seal forever his future and that of all the Mesoamerican nations. It is about the alliance that they established with the Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s to march together to conquer Tenochtitlan. The Totonacs voluntarily contributed 1300 warriors to the power of Cort√©s,D√≠az del Castillo, Bernal (1568) Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa√±a, cap.

XLIV \\"El encarescimiento que Olintlec hizo del poder√≠o de Moteczuma\\", texto en la web arteHistoria, Junta de Castilla y Le√≥n The reasons for the alliance were to free themselves from the Mexica yoke. Once the defeat of the Mexica Empire was achieved, the Totonacs, including those of Cempoala, were in command of the Spanish Empire, and then evangelized and partly acculturized by the first and later Mexican viceroyal authorities. They were converted into serfs of the Spaniards under the encomienda system, becoming serfs of the indigenous settlers and caciques, particularly in the nascent sugarcane crop, during the rule of Nu√±o de Guzm√°n.Garc√≠a Icazbalceta, Joaqu√≠n Colecci√≥n de documentos para la historia de M√©xico, Fragmentos de una historia de Nueva Galicia y Relaciones an√≥nimas de las jornadas de Nu√±o de Guzm√°n en Nueva Galicia textos en l√≠nea Cervantes virtual A short time later, Cempoala was uninhabited and its culture extinguished and forgotten. The ancient Totonac culture was discovered again at the end of the 19th century by the Mexican archaeologist and historian Francisco del Paso y Troncoso. Apparently, the Totonacs were part of the Tula Empire and from 1450 they were conquered by the Nahuas of the Aztec Triple Alliance and joined the troops. Currently, they inhabit 26 municipalities in the north of the State of Puebla and 14 municipalities in the north of the State of Veracruz, in Mexico, and preserve their ancestral language and customs.  Religion  The Totonacs, like all the civilizations of Mesoamerica, were polytheists. The main cult surrendered to the Sun, with human sacrifices; In addition, they worshiped the Goddess of Corn, who was the wife of the Sun, their sacrifices were not human, since \\"She detested them\\", instead, they offered animal sacrifices and offerings of herbs and flowers. Another important divinity was \\"Old Thunder\\", the \\"Owner of all the waters, but not the rain\\", he wanted to flood the world, because people who drowned became his servants.  Daily life  They made their clothes with fiber natural textiles. The traditional garment of the totancas women was the \\"quechqu√©metl\\", an embroidered dress, wide and long, that is still worn among the current Totonac women. The men wore only a loincloth. Their houses consisted of only one rectangular room, in which, without divisions, were simple and scarce wooden furniture. The room had a thatched roof or palm leaves and the structures on the walls were thick sticks.  References   Bibliography  * I. Bernall and E. D√°valos, Huastetecos y totonacos, 1953. * H.R.

Style Cinematic soul builds on the foundations of soul music. The backing track can include drums, bass guitar, clavinet and electric guitar played with a wah-wah pedal. On top of this are orchestral instruments including a string section and brass, similar to that heard on a movie soundtrack. History During their psychedelic soul period of 1968-73, The Temptations created what is described as \\"cinematic soul\\", songs, often long in length, with longer instrumental introductions and detailed orchestration. Two such examples are the Temptations' 1972 recording of \\"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\\", and their follow-up single, \\"Masterpiece\\". Isaac Hayes' \\"Theme from Shaft\\" was considered another good example of cinematic soul, and subsequently influenced David Bowie's \\"Stay\\", released several years later. Curtis Mayfield's \\"Superfly\\" was a top ten Billboard hit, and praised as an archetypical example of the genre. Artists continue to call their music cinematic soul into the 21st century. Barry Adamson's 2002 album The King of Nothing Hill opened with the track \\"Cinematic Soul\\", which was roughly based on \\"Theme from Shaft\\" and was conceived as a tribute to the genre. A compilation of the genre, Superbad Funk and Cinematic Soul was released in 2006. Singer/songwriter Jessica L√° Rel describes her music as cinematic soul, using soul as a base, then using other styles including classical and theatrical instrumentation.

Its task was, in peace as well as in war, to provide army units etcetera with especially trained staff for veterinary positions in the army. History =1887‚Äì1925= The Swedish Army Veterinary Corps was established in 1887 and constituted all veterinarians of the Swedish Army, previously summarized under the common name of the Veterin√§rstaten. The corps was under the command of the √ñverf√§ltl√§karen (\\"Chief Field Surgeon\\") and consisted of a field veterinarian (with the rank of major), 14 regimental veterinarians (with the rank of the captain), 26 battalion veterinarians (with the rank of lieutenant) and 8 veterinarian scholarship recipients (with the rank of underl√∂jtnant after the officers). The corps had their own military reserve. Positions in the corps were applied to at the National Swedish Medical Services Board (Sjukv√•rdsstyrelsen), which together with the National Swedish Board of Health delivered proposals to the King in Council. Scholarship was jointly ordered by the National Swedish Medical Board and the National Swedish Board of Health. In 1923, the staff of the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps was made up of active duty personnel, half- pay officers (reservstat) and military reserve. Active duty personnel occurred both out of and in troop units. Out of troop units: at the National Swedish Board of Health: 1 √ñverf√§ltveterin√§r (\\"Inspector of Army Veterinary Service\\") and 1 senior clerical officer (regimental veterinarian); at staffs and more: 6 field veterinarians, 1 at each Army Division Staff, 1 regimental veterinarian at Boden Garrison, 1 battalion veterinarians each at the Gotland military commander, Karlsborg Garrison and the Swedish Army Riding and Horse-Driving School at Str√∂msholm Palace. In troop units: 9 regimental veterinarians and 24 battalion veterinarians. Half-pay officers constituted 1 field veterinarians, 4 regimental veterinarians and 2 battalion veterinarians. These were obliged for military service in war and when conscripts were called in for the defence of the kingdom, as well as in peace for a maximum of 50 days during each 2-year period of service after the age of 48 and for no more than 100 days of each 3-year period up to the age of 48. The reserve staff constituted veterinarians who, with the right to a supplementary pension, resigned from active service or applied to depart from such active service, were admitted to the reserve and veterinarians who received their first employment. Veterinarians in the military reserve were obliged to service as veterinarian as half-pay officers and, in addition, were required to complete rehearsal training, partly after recruitment, and subsequently every three years until the age of 40 years. Military veterinary posts belonged to the following service classes: √∂verf√§ltveterin√§r (lieutenant colonel), field veterinaran (major), regimental veterinaran (captain), battalion veterinarian (older, captain (conditionally), younger, lieutenant). √ñverf√§ltveterin√§r could obtain colonels rank, and field veterinaran on active service lieutenant colonel and regimental veterinaran on active service major, respectively after 25 and 20 years of well-documented service. The eldest battalion veterinarian on active service could be assigned the captain's rank. The staff in the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps, as well as the half-pay officers held corresponding employment positions. The staff of the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps were under the supervision of the Medical Board of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration regarding its military-veterinary service and by the National Swedish Medical Board regarding its medical activities. =1925‚Äì1937= According to the Defence Act of 1925, the corps would consist of 1 √∂verf√§ltveterin√§r, 4 field veterinarians (division veterinarians), 6 regimental veterinarians and 15 battalion veterinarians. Of the regimental veterinarians, 1 was employed by the commandant in Boden and 1 in each of the Norrland Dragoon Regiment, Svea Artillery Regiment, G√∂ta Artillery Regiment and Wendes Artillery Regiment and the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration. Of the battalion veterinarians, 1 was employed at the Swedish Army Riding and Horse-Driving School, 1 at each of the Life Regiment Dragoons, Life Regiment Hussars, Scanian Cavalry Regiment (Sk√•nska kavalleriregementet), all field artillery regiments, Svea Engineer Corps and G√∂ta Engineer Corps, the Field Telegraph Corps and all service troop corps. The relevant division veterinary held the regimental veterinary services at the Life Regiment Dragoons, Life Regiment Hussars, Scanian Cavalry Regiment and Norrland Artillery Regiment. =1937‚Äì1969= At the beginning of 1937, all 26 postings on active service, namely 1 √∂verf√§ltveterin√§r, 4 field veterinarians, 6 regimental veterinarians and 15 battalion veterinarians, were filled by ordinary holders. As of 1 July 1937, the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps' part of the Defence Act of 1936 came into force. According to this, the active service staff would constitute 1 √∂verf√§ltveterin√§r, 4 field veterinarians, 8 regimental veterinarians and 11 battalion veterinarians. Previously, the military veterinary service in Sweden had been placed under the Army's Healthcare Board (Arm√©ns sjukv√•rdsstyrelse) with the Surgeon-Field General as highest commander, but from 1937 the military veterinary service had been separated from the army's healthcare service as the Field Veterinary Office (F√§ltveterin√§rbyr√•n), previously included in the Healthcare Board, was partly transferred to the newly established Veterinary Inspectorate (Veterin√§rinspektionen) with the Inspector of Army Veterinary Service (√ñverf√§ltveterin√§ren) as chief, and partly to the same newly established Horse and Veterinary Office (H√§st- och veterin√§rbyr√•n) in the Commissariat Department (Intendenturdepartementet). The Inspector of Army Veterinary Service thus became the head of the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps instead of the former Surgeon-Field General. The Veterinary Inspectorate (later the Army Inspectorate's Veterinary Department) handle and settled questions regarding veterinary staff, education, and horse health care, etc., that is, all military veterinary issues. Appropriations related to equipment and horses, remount, horse selection, etc., were handled by the Horse and Veterinary Equipment Office (H√§st- och veterin√§rmaterielbyr√•n) of the Commissariat Service Department (Intendenturavdelningen) (formerly the Commissariat Department, Intendenturdepartementet) with the Inspector of Army Veterinary Service as director. In early 1954, the active staff consisted of 1 Inspector of Army Veterinary Service, 7 field veterinarians, 7 regimental veterinarians and 9 battalion veterinarians. The corps ceased in 1969 (SFS 1969:409) by merging the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps, the Swedish Army Medical Corps (F√§ltl√§kark√•ren) and the Swedish Naval Medical Officers‚Äô Corps into the Medical Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces. Inspector of Army Veterinary Service The head of the Swedish Army Veterinary Corps was called √ñverf√§ltl√§kare (\\"Chief Field Surgeon\\") (1887-1914), then Generalf√§ltl√§kare (\\"Surgeon-Field General\\") (23 December 1914-1937), and then √ñverf√§ltveterin√§r (\\"Inspector of Army Veterinary Service\\" or \\"Chief of Veterinary Corps\\").

This law added sexual orientation as a protected status in housing, employment, and public accommodations. This movement was led by Equality Florida's leader Nadine Smith. The law took years to pass due to overruling in city meetings. Equality Florida is an advocacy group that advocates for equal LGBTQ rights for all Florida residents. This organization played a heavy role in passing the first St. Petersburg Human rights ordinance. For the years leading up to this event, the offices of St. Petersburg were consistently receiving mail from communities in an effort to address the city's failure to protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination. The bill to pass sexual orientation as an addition to the human rights ordinance was previously denied in a county commissioners meeting in 2001. This means that discrimination against age, race, and gender was still prohibited in the workplace, real estate and in public, but sexual orientation was excluded from this law. While supporters argued that this ordinance offered further protection in addition to civil rights laws, opponents of this ordinance argued that the city should not have to further protect those with \\"alternate lifestyles\\". It was not until January 2002 that the human rights ordinance law was passed which protected discrimination against rage, gender, age AND sexual orientation in St. Petersburg. This later led to the passing of Pinellas County's own human rights ordinance that protected against the same discriminations in 2008.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History In 1835, Levi H. Goodrich, and two of his six sons, Enos and Moses, moved from Erie County, New York and purchased 1,000 acres of land along the Kearsley Creek. Other family members and neighbors followed in 1836, and the Goodrich brothers built a dam and sawmill circa 1836‚Äì1837. The town of Goodrich was platted near the millpond, and the first frame homes, stores and an inn (the Goodrich House; still extant) were constructed in what is now the historic district. In 1844 a gristmill was constructed, and Goodrich became a processing center for the surrounding agricultural area. The village grew slowly during the latter part of the 19th century, adding small manufacturing and becoming a stagecoach stop. In 1877, a group of village women founded the Goodrich Ladies' Library Association and purchased a building on Main Street. A township hall was built in 1893. As the twentieth century turned, the village grew slowly, with developers platting a small addition after the Detroit United Interurban Railway constructed lines southwest of the village in 1900. In 1916, a fire destroyed a row of frame buildings on Main Street and anew brick commercial block was constructed. As the village grew, several residential structures were added. However, the size of the town center essentially remained as it had, and 100 years later the core of the village remains intact. Description The Hegel Road Historic District stretches along the two blocks of Hegel Road that define the original Goodrich town center, and includes twenty structures, seventeen of which contribute to the historic character of the district. Ten of these twenty structures are residential, four are institutional (two libraries, one post office, and one fire station), and six are commercial. Construction materials in the district are varied. Notably, several one-story, end gable, wood-framed commercial structures are still standing in the district. The remaining commercial structures are brick, and of relatively modest ornamentation. The residential structures range from Greek Revival to Queen Anne to bungalow styles. Significant structures include: *Goodrich Ladies' Library: This building was originally a residence, but in 1883 it was purchased by the Goodrich Ladies' Library Association and converted into a library. In 1903, half of the building was destroyed by fire; the present building is the remaining half. The library is a one-and-one-half-story, wood-framed structure with a gable roof and clapboard siding. *Atlas Town Hall: The town hall was built in 1893. It is a two-story, rectangular, brick structure with Victorian styling. *Goodrich House: The Goodrich House was built in approximately 1846, and was one of the earliest structures built in the district. It served as a saloon and as an overnight stop for travelers. It is a two-story, L-shaped, wood-framed Greek Revival structure with clapboard siding.

The name comes from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Kulkowitz purchased the hotel in 1978. In 1983, a review in The New York Times praised the Mad Batter for its lychee duck and snow peas, introduced after Kulkowitz visited Thailand and brought back a chef. He did major renovations on the hotel in 1985, introducing air conditioning, refurbishing antique furniture, and adding a bathroom to every guest room. In 2016, Kulkowitz's son Mark and his wife Pam Huber, who currently own the hotel and restaurant, renovated the front porch to become a year-round gathering spot.

The film was produced by Kalanithi Maran under the banner Sun Pictures. The film stars Rajinikanth in the lead role along with Vijay Sethupathi, Simran, Trisha, Sasikumar, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Bobby Simha, Sananth, Megha Akash, and Malavika Mohanan in supporting roles. The music was composed by Anirudh Ravichander with editing done by Vivek Harshan and cinematography by Tirru. The film was released on 10 January 2019 along with dubbed versions in Hindi and Telugu.  Plot  Kaali, an elderly man, takes up the job of a boys' hostel warden at a college in Ooty. He notices that the hostel is dominated by a group of unruly final-year students, who are led by Michael, the spoiled son of a local leader named Gnanam. Kaali puts a stop to Michael's antics, which leads to enmity between the two. Kaali also forms a close bond with a NRI hostelite named Anwar, who is in a relationship with Anu, the daughter of Mangalam, a pranic healer. Kaali convinces Mangalam to accept her daughter's relationship with Anwar, and they end up falling in love. Michael, who lusts for Anu, is angered on hearing of her relationship with Anwar. He attempts to harass them, only to be stopped by Kaali, who ensures the suspension of Michael and his friends, with Anwar recording and sharing the humiliation of Michael and his gang. This video is noticed far away in Uttar Pradesh by a local goon named Jithu, the son of a powerful politician called Singaaram alias Singaar Singh. Singaar, on seeing Anwar in the video as well as in a photo with his mother on Facebook, sends his men to Ooty to kill Anwar, for unknown reasons. At the same time, Michael, humiliated at his suspension, sends his men to beat up (but not kill) Kaali. Michael's plan backfires as he and his men are caught in the fight between Kaali and Singaar's men. Kaali subdues Singaar's men, earning Michael's and Gnanam's respect, following which Anwar learns about his past. Anwar is the son of Maalik, who was Kaali's best friend. It is also revealed that Kaali's real name is Petta Velan alias Petta and that he was a well-respected man in his village in Madurai district. Twenty years ago, Maalik was in love with Petta's neighbour Poongodi, who conceived with him out of wedlock. When Petta heard of this, he and his wife Saraswathy alias Saro managed to convince Poongodi's father Rajapandi to get Poongodi married to Maalik, even though Rajapandi and Petta were sworn enemies. But Rajapandi's two sons, Devaaram and Singaar, vehemently opposed the alliance as well as the transfer of property to Poongodi. They then killed their father. Petta, on hearing about Rajapandi's murder, killed Devaaram during Rajapandi's funeral and chased Singaar out of the village. As revenge for Devaaram's killing and his forced exile, Singaar orchestrates a bomb blast during Poongodi's seemantham, killing Maalik, Saro, and Petta and Saro's son Chinna. Petta, after finding that Poongodi was still alive, took her to safety. Poongodi later gave birth to a boy, who is revealed to be Anwar, and both of them left for Australia as refugees to escape from Singaar. On hearing this story, Petta and Anwar, along with Michael's henchmen, leave for Uttar Pradesh to finish off Singaar once and for all. In Uttar Pradesh, Petta and Anwar confront Jithu, who is determined to kill them both after learning that his father and Petta are enemies. The duo manage to escape Jithu. Later, Petta meets Jithu privately and tells him that he is none other than his son Chinna, who did not die in the bomb blast, but was adopted by Singaar after finding him still alive in the wreckage of the blast. When Jithu confronts Singaar regarding his parentage, the latter sends his men to kill Jithu, who is rescued by Petta. Along with Anwar and Michael's henchmen, Petta and Jithu then barge into Singaar's mansion and kill him and his henchmen. Following Singaar's death, Petta has a surprise in store for Jithu. He reveals that Jithu is not his son and that he really is Singaar's son. He used him to lead him to Singaar as part of a strategy to kill the latter. He further adds that Chinna had died in the bomb blast twenty years ago. After this shocking revelation, Petta points his gun at Jithu. The screen cuts to black, and a gunshot afterwards is heard.

Ranjith's Kaala (2018), Rajinikanth held final discussions with a group of young directors, including Arun Prabu Purushothaman, Atlee, and Karthik Subbaraj for his next project. On 23 February 2018, production house Sun Pictures announced that they would produce a film starring Rajinikanth to be directed by Karthik Subbaraj. To accommodate the film's shoot throughout the course of 2018, the director postponed the pre-production work of another proposed film starring Dhanush for Y NOT Studios. Subbaraj revealed that he was confident about approaching Rajinikanth to work on his film, after the actor was impressed with his earlier project, Jigarthanda (2014) and expressed a desire to collaborate. The pair had first discussed the script in early 2017, but Rajinikanth did not take a final call until finishing his existing filming commitments to Kaala and 2.0 (2018). Talking about the project, Subbaraj initially revealed that the film would be an \\"action drama\\" which was \\"fictional\\" but \\"realistic\\". Anirudh Ravichander was signed on to work as the film's music composer in early March 2018, in a move which saw him collaborate with his maternal uncle Rajinikanth, and Subbaraj, for the first time. Tirru and Vivek Harshan were selected to be the film's cinematographer and editor respectively, continuing their collaboration with Subbaraj following their work in Mercury (2018). Likewise, stunt choreographer Peter Hein also joined the team thereafter. In late May 2018, Subbaraj and Tirru went on a recce to scout locations in Nepal and North India to shoot the film. The film's title Petta was revealed on 7 September 2018. = Casting = Vijay Sethupathi was signed on to play a character in April 2018, and accordingly reworked his dates to fit the film into his busy schedule. The actor signed the film after a month of media speculation that he would portray a villainous role, and revealed that he signed the film as he had blind trust in Subbaraj, and initially did not request to listen to the script. Subbaraj had also been keen to sign Fahadh Faasil for a role in the film, but the actor's filming commitments for Varathan (2018) meant that he could not allot dates. Hindi film actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui joined the cast in July 2018, while two other regular collaborators of Subbaraj, actors Bobby Simha and Sananth, were also signed to play pivotal roles in the film. Other members of the cast included supporting actors Guru Somasundaram, Ramdoss, Shabeer Kallarakkal, Deepak Paramesh, Adithya Shivpink, and Manikandan R. Achari. For leading female roles, the team held discussions throughout March 2018 with actresses Trisha, Deepika Padukone, and Anjali, but neither were signed immediately. In July 2018, the producers announced that Simran had joined the cast to play as pair of Rajinikanth. Trisha was eventually added to the cast in August 2018, while Malavika Mohanan was also signed to appear alongside Rajinikanth. Megha Akash was cast as Sananth's pair, and joined the shoot before the release of any of her initial Tamil films, Boomerang, Enai Noki Paayum Thota and Oru Pakka Kathai. In October, M. Sasikumar and J. Mahendran joined the cast. = Filming = Principal photography began in June 2018. The first schedule of the shoot began on 7 June at Eastern Forest Rangers College at St. Mary's Hill, Kurseong in Darjeeling, with the initial portions lasting nine days.

M. Suganth from The Times of India, rated 3.5 out of 5, stating that \\"Petta is less of a Karthik Subbaraj film, but it gives Rajini fans their Thalaivar in a way that they have been dying to see him, celebrating the Rajinisms.\\" Filmibeat rated the film 3.5 out of 5, stating \\"Petta is definitely a film that stays loyal to its genre and it keeps the audiences entertained despite some of the dragging moments in the second half. It is indeed a treat for all Rajinikanth fans as the superstar steals the show in a way that only he can.\\" Srinivasa Ramanujam of The Hindu stated that \\"Despite quite a few underwritten characters, Petta triumphs by bringing back the Superstar of yore!\\" NDTV rated the film 2.5 out of 5, and summarised that \\"Rajinikanth returns to the basics with aplomb. Just go and watch it for the Rajinikanth that you missed in his last few releases.\\" Indiaglitz rated the film 3.75 out of 5, stating that \\"Go for this kickass true blue Thalaivar movie in which Karthik Subbaraj Rajinifies you.\\" Sify rated the film 3 out of 5. India Today rated the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, and summarised that \\"Petta is a classic Rajinikanth film that his fans should not miss\\". Anusha Iyengar from the Times Now rated 3.5 out of 5, with a verdict \\"Petta is a complete mass entertainer with twists and turns that will make you howl in the theatres like you would in a Thalaiva film. It is relevant to the current day and age; it‚Äôs a film that all Rajinikanth fans will definitely enjoy!\\" Baradwaj Rangan, rated the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, stating \\"Jigarthanda and Iraivi were sprawling stories but there was a sense of a gradual buildup, the sense of the narrative noose being slowly tightened. But Petta looks rushed and even the Karthik Subbaraj flourishes come off like affectations\\" Behindwoods rated the film 3 out of 5, stating that \\"Style! Mass! Style! Petta is a celebration of Superstar Rajinikanth. Go enjoy it.\\" In contrast, The Indian Express rated 2 out of 5 stars, reviewing that \\"Karthik Subbaraj has a sense of style, which breaks through only occasionally in Petta. For that Rajini Sarr will have to submit a little more to the script, and a last little twist in the long drawn- out climax holds out hope.\\" Gauthaman Baskaran, from News18 rated 1 out of 5 stating that, \\"Petta turns out be yet another outing for Rajinikanth who relies on gimmicks rather than solid performance.\\"  Box office  Petta was released on 600 screens in Tamil Nadu with tough competition from Viswasam. The film grossed ‚Çπ1.12 crore at the Chennai box office. The film also grossed $133K at the US, overtaking Viswasam which grossed $18K.

The band currently consists of lead vocalist Henry Spychalski, guitarists James Donovan and Duc Peterman, bassist Nico Mohnblatt, drummer Achilleas Sarantaris and live keyboardist Seth Evans.  Background  HMLTD formed in London as Happy Meal Ltd. in early 2015. Singer Henry Spychalski was born and raised in Torquay before moving to London. Spychalski met Duc, who'd played in a band with Nico in Paris, at a bar in London which helped foster a friendship and the formation of the band. James originates from Ipswich and shared a house in Elephant and Castle with friends including Henry. Zac, from Bristol, met Duc through Reddit and \\"less vile corners\\" of 4chan, and Vincent from Hong Kong; when he returned home in late 2015 he was replaced by Achilleas, originally from Athens. Late in 2019, Zac left the band to focus on his education, he was replaced by Seth Evans, a friend of the band, who they met in London. HMLTD has been criticised for allegedly appropriating queer and/or gender bender aesthetics as heterosexual men, including cross-dressing, make-up, and flamboyant performances. Spychalski argues that \\"A lot of it comes down to wanting to create something beautiful. But something that doesn‚Äôt necessarily fall within the standard confines of what you might call beauty\\". Their image and sound can be seen as influenced by the Ziggy Stardust era of David Bowie and the New Romantic period in the 1980s. Their sound has been compared to a wide range of acts such as The Prodigy and Peaches. They have also been regarded as avant-garde for their infusion of EDM and experimental pop with their guitar-oriented sound. On 20 July 2018, HMLTD released their debut extended play, Hate Music Last Time Delete. Pictures Of You was written with Justin Tranter. On 7 February 2020, HMLTD released their debut studio album West of Eden. According to lead singer, Henry Spychalski, the album took almost four years to create, due to the interspersed writing as every member was in university education. The album tour swiftly followed the release, spanning the length of the UK, as well as various European cities.

Despite failing to win as a juvenile in 1995 she showed promise as he was placed in both her races. In the following spring she won a maiden race and then recorded her biggest success when recording an upset victory in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. She failed to win again but ran well in defeat in three subsequent races. As a broodmare she produced several minor winners but no top-class winners. Background Ta Rib was a chestnut mare with a small white star bred in Kentucky by Shadwell Farms, the breeding operation of her owner Hamdan Al Maktoum. The filly was sent to race in England and entered training with Ed Dunlop at the Gainsborough Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by the hugely influential American stallion Mr. Prospector. Although he was best known for his success in the United States, Mr. Prospector was also the sire of numerous major winners in Europe including Kingmambo, Machiavellian, Lycius, Distant View and Ravinella. Ta Rib's dam Madame Secretary won two races and was a half-sister to two horses with very different aptitudes, namely Green Ruby, a sprinter who won the Stewards' Cup and Zero Watt, an out-and-out stayer who won the Ascot Stakes. She was a descendant of the American broodmare Dust Whirl (foaled 1928), making her a distant relative of Whirlaway and Conquistador Cielo. Racing career =1995: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Ta Rib started at odds of 12/1 in an eighteen-runner maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 25 August and stayed on strongly to finish second, beaten a length by Hamdan Al Maktoum's other runner Ruznama. A month later at Ascot Racecourse she started the 3/1 second favourite for a minor event and ran third behind Story Line and Double Leaf. In this race she was ridden by Willie Carson, who partnered her in all her subsequent starts. =1996: three-year-old season= Ta Rib began her second season in a maiden over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 3 May in which she started at odds of 11/4 and recorded her first victory as she won by five lengths from the favourite Fatefully after taking the lead three furlongs out. Nine days after her win at Newmarket the filly was sent to France and stepped up in class and distance for the Group 1 Poule d'Essai des Pouliches over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. She started at 14.1/1 in a nine-runner field headed by Shake The Yoke, with the other runners being True Flare (Prix de Pont Neuf), A Votre Sante (Prix La Camrgo), Housa Dancer (Prix Finlande) and Shawanni (fifth in the 1000 Guineas). Ta Rib raced close behind the leaders and turned into the straight in second place behind Shawanni. She went to the front 300 metres from the finish and kept on well under pressure to win by three quarters of a length from Shake The Yoke with the Irish-trained outsider Sagar Pride taking third. Ed Dunlop, who was winning a classic race at his first attempt said \\"I must pay credit to Ta Rib's owner, Sheikh Hamdan. He made the decision to come here today and he's been proved right again. Willie Carson rode a brilliant race\\". At Royal Ascot on 19 June Ta Rib started second favourite for the Coronation Stakes but after racing in second for most of the way she faded in the closing stages and came home fourth behind Shake The Yoke, Last Second and Dance Design. In the Falmouth Stakes she finished second of the nine runners, beaten one and three quarter lengths by the French- trained filly Sensation. Ta Rib was matched against male opposition at Newbury Racecourse on 16 August in the seven furlong Hungerford Stakes, a race in which she carried an eight-pound weight penalty for her Group 1 success, and finished fourth behind the four-year-old colt Bin Rosie. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Ta Rib was retired to become a broodmare for Shadwell. She produced at least seven foals and five winners between 1998 and 2008: *Kabeer, a chestnut colt (later gelded), foaled in 1998, sired by Unfuwain. Won six races. *Mawaheb, chestnut filly, 1999, by Nashwan. Won one race. *Khaizarana, bay filly, 2000, by Alhaarth. Won one race. *Estihlal, bay filly, 2001, by Green Desert.

Failed to win in one race. Pedigree * Ta Rib was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Nasrullah, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Young has frequently included it in live sets and it has been included on a number of live and compilation albums. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" tell of the changes in a relationship over time, using musical and pop culture figures as reference points. The \\"Hank\\" in the title refers to either Hank Williams or Hank Marvin, both of whom inspired Young, and the \\"Hendrix\\" refers to Jimi Hendrix. Humanities professor Martin Halliwell takes the view that \\"Hank\\" refers to Hank Williams and interprets the title as referring to the 2 musical directions Young likes to take - Williams' acoustic country blues versus Hendrix' \\"histrionic guitar blues.\\" The pop culture touch points in the song are Marilyn Monroe and Madonna. The early verses of the song tell of the singer's devotion to the woman, as he sings about how he believed in her and loved her smile over the period covered by the song. But the mood of the lyrics shifts when the singer notes that \\"Now we're headed for the big divorce California-style.\\" The reference to divorce suggests that the song may be about Young's ex-wife at the time Carrie Snodgress. Rolling Stone Album Guide contributor Rob Sheffield contrasts this song with the Harvest Moon title track in that \\"Harvest Moon\\" celebrates a marriage that lasted while \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" mourns one that did not. But many of the Harvest Moon songs, including the title track, are about his then-current wife Pegi Young, in which case the reference to divorce is more jolting. Young has explained that \\"The divorce is never mentioned again [in the song]. It's just another element in the relationship.\\" Young has further stated: > Well that's one part of the story. There's a whole bunch of things in > there...You're constantly wondering which way things are going to go. > Whether it's going to last or whether it's going to explode. That's part of > the romantic relationship, certain amounts of turmoil. Rolling Stone critic Greg Kot places this song within a progression of songs that opens Harvest Moon, which \\"traces a path from restlessness to reaffirmation, in which the rootless 'Unknown Legend' and the doubt-filled narrator of 'From Hank to Hendrix' finally find contentment beneath the 'Harvest Moon.'‚Äù Ken Bielen suggests that the line about divorce displays Young's economical use of words in that the \\"California-style\\" divorce suggests the celebrity-driven culture in the U.S and the possible personal cost of that culture. Bielen compares lines in the opening verse that the narrator is a musician with a later line that \\"The same thing that makes you live/Can kill you in the end\\" as implying that \\"the rock-and-roll lifestyle can take a toll on a marriage.\\" And indeed Young's marriage to Pegi came to an end 22 years later. Young biographer David Downing interprets the reference to divorce a little differently. He interprets that the fact that the possibility of divorce is mentioned once but then not again as suggesting that divorce is just part of marriage the way death is part of life. Downing interprets the song as being an \\"ambitious attempt at understanding the process by which people carry their pasts into their presents.\\" Bielen describes both the song's melody and Young's vocal as being \\"tender.\\" In a link to Young's earlier album Harvest, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor provide backing vocals on the refrain. Neil Young FAQ author Glen Boyd comments on the \\"gorgeous\\" pedal steel accents played by Ben Keith. Reception Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" to be one of Young's best songs. In 2014, the editors of Rolling Stone ranked \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" as Neil Young's 20th greatest song of all time. A Rolling Stone reader poll in 2016 ranked \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" as Young's 9th best song since 1979. Music journalist Paul Williams says that the lyrics start out promising but he considers the \\"payoff line,\\" \\"Can we make it last, like a musical ride?\\" to be \\"almost as bad as the dreadful American Dream stuff Neil wrote for the last CSNY album.\\" \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" was included on the 1993 compilation album Silver & Gold. Live performances Young has often played \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" in live sets, frequently to open concerts. Many times Young tells the story of how he acquired a guitar previously owned by Hank Williams before playing the song. Young played it as the last song of his 1993 MTV Unplugged concert and it was included on his Unplugged album. Young also sang it at a Saturday Night Live performance, which the editors of Rolling Stone described as \\"casting a spell that few performers his age could match ‚Äì a rock elder sharing a little of his hard-won wisdom.\\" References Neil Young songs Songs written by Neil Young 1992 songs Song recordings produced by Neil Young ","title":"From Hank to Hendrix"},{"id":"58426207","text":"\\"Unknown Legend\\" is a song written by Neil Young that was first released on his 1992 album Harvest Moon. Although it was not released as a single, it reached #38 on the Billboard Magazine Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Music and lyrics Although \\"Unknown Legend\\" was not released until 1992, it was written earlier, closer to the release of Young's 1978 album Comes a Time, and several critics have noted a similarity between the style of \\"Unknown Legend\\" and the material on Comes a Time, particularly the song \\"Motorcycle Mama.\\" Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes the song as being based on a \\"simple, folksy guitar riff and melody.\\" As with several other songs on Harvest Moon, Linda Rondstadt provided backup vocals in the refrains. Ben Keith plays pedal steel, in a performance that Young biographer Jimmy McDonough describes as providing \\"proud but sad\\" accents. The lyrics describe a woman who had worked in a diner and rode a Harley Davidson, but now is raising two children. The lyrics were inspired by multiple people. Nigel Williamson feels that the lyric about how the woman used to work in a diner was inspired by Young's first wife Susan Acevedo and that the lyrics about an \\"unknown legend\\" who is raising two kids but still has \\"the far away look in her eyes\\" were inspired by his later wife Pegi Young, and music critic Johnny Rogan agrees that the character described by the lyrics seems to be a combination of the two. Young biographer Glen Boyd similarly sees a portrait of Pegi in the lyrics about working in a diner and raising two kids, as well as in a line about \\"her long blonde hair flowin' in the wind.\\" Nonetheless, Young has described his inspiration as being more expansive, stating: > It's inspired by some people I know and some people I don't know and all > kinds of things put together...They're just pictures, people's lives. A lot > of the common thing is survival, not losing what it is you were when you > were young, but take it with you, take it with you into your own age. Don't > leave it behind. Young biographer David Downing sees the song as one of several on Harvest Moon that describe Americans feeling a deep sense of loss for unknown reasons in 1992. Reception In a 2016 Rolling Stone Magazine readers poll, \\"Unknown Legend\\" ranked as Young's 4th best post-1970s song. It reached #38 on the Billboard Magazine Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considers \\"Unknown Legend\\" to be one of Young's best songs, describing it as \\"lovely.\\" McDonough describes it as \\"perhaps the empathetic portrait of a woman [Young has] ever created. Greenwald calls the arrangement \\"exquisite\\" and comments how the lyrics provide a \\"clear\\" and \\"cinematic\\" picture of the female protagonist. Live performances Young performed \\"Unknown Legend\\" for his 1993 MTV Unplugged concert and it was included on his Unplugged album. For the Unplugged concert, Astrid Young and Nicolette Larson performed the backing vocal that Rondstadt performed on the Harvest Moon album. Young later played the song live on his 2015 tour.

These primary symptoms can result in secondary symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, and lack of concentration. All symptoms of vestibular dysfunction can significantly decrease quality of life, introducing mental-emotional issues such as anxiety and depression, and greatly impair an individual, causing them to become more sedentary. Decreased mobility results in weaker muscles, less flexible joints, and worsened stamina, as well as decreased social and occupational activity. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy can be used in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy in order to reduce anxiety and depression resulting from an individual's change in lifestyle.  Vestibular disorders  The term \\"vestibular\\" refers to the inner ear system with its fluid-filled canals that allow for balance and spatial orientation. Some common vestibular disorders include vestibular neuritis, M√©ni√®re's disease, and nerve compression. Vestibular dysfunction can exist unilaterally, affecting only one side of the body, or bilaterally, affecting both sides. The most commonly vestibular disorder is called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The BPPV is characterized by temporary dizziness feeling associated with blurred vision in relation to certain head positions. BPPV may affects anterior, posterior or horizontal vestibular canals. Posterior canal was reported in the literature as the most commonly affected canal, 80% of the patients diagnosed with BPPV. Several positional tests such as Hall-bike dix test, supine roll test, and head shaking nystagmus test may indicate which canal is affected by BPPV. Vestibular damage is often irreparable and symptoms are persistent. Although the body naturally compensates for vestibular dysfunction (as it does for the dysfunction or deficiency of any sense), vestibular rehabilitation furthers the compensation process to decrease both primary and secondary symptoms. In cases of chronic vestibular dysfunction, medication in the form of vestibular suppressants does not allow the nervous system to undergo compensation. Thus, long-term medication is not a viable option for individuals with chronic vestibular dysfunction. Because of this, vestibular rehabilitation therapy is a better alternative for long-term vestibular dysfunction. However, some medications, such as anticholinergics, antihistamines, and benzodiazepines, are useful in acute cases (of 5 days or less) for reducing nausea and other secondary symptoms.  Diagnostic tests  Because the methods of vestibular rehabilitation therapy differ for different disorders, the form of vestibular dysfunction, ability level, and history of symptoms, each patient must be carefully assessed in order to diagnose vestibular dysfunction and to choose the correct exercises for treatment. In some cases, vestibular rehabilitation may not be the appropriate treatment at all. Vestibular disorders can be diagnosed using several different kinds of assessments, some of which include examination of an individual's ability to maintain posture, balance, and head position. Some diagnostic tests are more easily performed in a clinical setting than others but relay less specific information to the tester, and vice versa. A proper history of symptoms should include what those symptoms are, how often they occur, and under what circumstances, including whether the symptoms are triggered or spontaneous. Other conditions that can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation therapy are symptoms of concussions and dizziness in patients with multiple sclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging techniques can be used as diagnostic tools to determine the presence of issues that can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation, regardless of whether they are vestibular in nature. = Caloric reflex test = The caloric reflex test is designed to test the function of the vestibular system and can determine the cause of vestibular symptoms. The reflex test consists of pouring water into the external auditory canal of a patient and observing nystagmus, or involuntary eye movement. With normal vestibular function, the temperature of the water has an effect on the direction of eye movement. In individuals with peripheral unilateral vestibular hypofunction, nystagmus is absent. = Rotational chair testing = This test is used to test bilateral vestibular hypofunction and the degree of central nervous system (CNS) compensation that results. Movement of fluid within the inner ear, known as endolymph, is responsible for the relationship between eye movement and head velocity. The test consists of seating a patient in a rotating chair, rotating the chair to specific velocity, and observing eye movement. In individuals with normal vestibular function, the velocity of eye movement should be equal and opposite that of head movement. Lower rotational velocities are used to assess extent of CNS compensation. = Visual perception testing = Visual perception testing can assess a patient's ability to determine vertically- and horizontally-oriented objects, but with a limited degree of specificity. When asked to align a bar to horizontal or vertical, an individual with normal vestibular function can align the bar within 2.5 degrees of horizontal or vertical. An inability to do so indicates vestibular dysfunction. In some cases, the direction of tilt away from the desired orientation is on the same side as the dysfunction, while in some cases the opposite is true. = Posturography = Using various technologies to assess a person's ability to maintain posture and balance, different patterns of posturography can be determined. Once a pattern is determined, the modalities and inputs that the person relies on to maintain balance can be inferred. Knowing what systems and structures influence a person's stance can suggest different areas of dysfunction and preference. = Non-vestibular dizziness = In some cases, the results of vestibular tests are normal, yet the patient experiences vestibular symptoms, especially balance issues and dangerous falls. Some diagnoses that result in non-vestibular dizziness are concussions, Parkinson's disease, cerebellar ataxia, normal-pressure hydrocephalus, leukoaraiosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, and large-fiber peripheral neuropathy. There are also several disorders known as chronic situation-related dizziness disorders. For example, phobic postural vertigo (PPV) occurs when an individual with obsessive-compulsive characteristics experiences a sense of imbalance, despite the absence of balance issues. Chronic subjective dizziness (CSD) is a similar condition characterized by persistent vertigo, hypersensitivity to motion stimuli, and difficulty with precise visual tasks. Both phobic postural vertigo and chronic subjective dizziness may be treated with vestibular rehabilitation therapy or other therapeutic methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy and conditioning.  Rehabilitation exercises  Vestibular rehabilitation is specific to the dysfunction that a patient experiences. Some treatment methods seek to eliminate the cause of vestibular dysfunction, while others allow the brain to compensate for dysfunction without targeting the source. The former goal is for treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, while the latter treats vestibular hypofunction, which cannot be cured. The treatment process should begin as early as possible, to decrease fall risk. The patient should start slowly, gradually increasing the intensity and duration of exercises, and be accompanied by an accessible and reassuring therapist, as discomfort and negative emotional states can negatively affect treatment. = Treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo = Treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BBPV) depends on the canals involved (horizontal or vertical) and which form of BBPV the patient is experiencing (canalithiasis versus cupulolithiasis). Canalithiasis is characterized by a dislodged otolith particle, called otoconia, that floats in the fluid in one of the three vestibular canals and cause the feeling of dizziness with vision disturbances. On the other hand, cupulolithiasis is another form of BPPV caused by an attachment of otolith particle in the cupula (the base of semicircular canal) of the involved canal.  Canalith repositioning treatments  Canalith repositioning treatments (CRT) aim to move debris in the inner ear out of the semicircular canal in order to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. CRT has 5 key elements: # Premedication of the patient # Specific positions # Timing of shifts between positions # Use of vibration # Post-maneuver instructions Early attempts to treat BBPV involved similar processes that were believed to be habituation exercises, but more likely dislodged and dissolved debris. = Treatment of vestibular hypofunction = Vestibular hypofunction can be a unilateral or bilateral vestibular loss. There are three types of vestibular rehabilitation exercises to reduce symptoms in cases where physical dysfunction cannot be reduced. The category of exercises chosen by a vestibular therapist depends on the problems reported by the patient. The following exercises can be used to treat dizziness with fast movements or exposure to intense visual stimuli, difficulty seeing (appearance of bouncing or jumping visual field) with head movement, and trouble with balance.  Habituation  Habituation exercise aims to repeatedly expose patients to stimuli that provoke dizziness, such as certain motions and harsh visual stimuli. The provoking stimulus will induce dizziness at first, but with continued habituation exercises, the brain can adapt to discount the stimulus and dizziness reduces. As this occurs, the exercises can increase in intensity. The patient should take breaks between exercises when symptoms are experienced, until the symptoms stop.  Gaze stabilization  Gaze stabilization exercises aim to increase visual ability during head movement. The goal of the patient during these exercises is to maintain the gaze during head movement. One kind of gaze stabilization exercise involves looking at a target and moving the head back and forth, without looking away from the target. Another exercise requires looking from one target to another, first without moving the head, and then moving the head to be aligned with the target without shifting the eyes. The last exercise for gaze stabilization is known as the remembered-target exercise and is performed partially with the eyes closed. First, the patient looks at a target object directly in front of them. Next, the patient closes their eyes and turns their head and turns it back. When the patient opens their eyes, they should still be looking at the target object.  Balance training  Balance-training exercises (also known as postural-stabilization exercises) are designed to improve a patient's ability to stay upright, and reduce the likelihood of dangerous falls. Balance-training exercises can be done walking or standing and can incorporate head movements and habituation exercises to limit exacerbation of symptoms. Increased postural stability can be achieved using visual and somatosensory cues. Thus, exercises in this category challenge the body's use of these cues by limiting or changing them. For example, having the patient close their eyes limits their ability to rely on visual cues to maintain postural stability, while having the patient stand on foam alters their reliance on somatosensory signals.  Effectiveness  The limitations of vestibular rehabilitation therapy are the overall health and function of the nervous system, especially the brainstem, cerebellum, and visual and somatosensory centers. The ultimate goal of vestibular rehabilitation therapy is reduction of vertigo, dizziness, gaze instability, poor balance, and dangerous falls; in some cases this goal is achieved without reducing dysfunction. Other factors that determine the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation are behavioral ones, such as patient compliance to home exercises and limitations in daily life; the severity of the disorder (including unilateral versus bilateral dysfunction); the mental-emotional state of the patient, and other medical conditions and medications. Research has shown that, overall, 80 to 85 percent of patients with chronic vestibular disability reported a reduction in symptoms after VR. There is evidence that vestibular rehabilitation therapy increases the \\"balance, quality of life, and functional capacity\\" of patients with multiple sclerosis. In a study of 109 children, an association between completion of vestibular rehabilitation and improvement of concussion symptoms and visuovestibular performance was found. A different study found that vestibular and physical therapy were linked to a shorter recovery period, resulting in a more rapid return to sports.  Training and certification  Vestibular rehabilitation can be facilitated by a medical professional with a specialization in neurology or vestibular disorders. An official specialist certification is not required, and in many places, is not offered. The leading association of physical therapists in each country determines what disciplines have specialization status and the requirements of an individual to obtain certification in a specialty. = In the US = Members of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) who undergo specialist certification in neurology via the American Board of Physical Therapy Specialties (ABPTS) can administer vestibular rehabilitation exercises. While the APTA does not offer official certification in vestibular rehabilitation, it does offer courses regarding vestibular rehabilitation at introductory and advanced levels. The Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy and the Vestibular Rehabilitation Special Interest Group are working to have the APTA establish VR as an official specialty offered by the ABPTS. The American Musculoskeletal Institute (AMSI) offers a 3-day course that results in a therapist being designated a Certified Vestibular Rehabilitation Specialist (Cert. VRS). Members of the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) who obtain specialty certification in low-vision rehabilitation are equipped to treat vision issues that arise from vestibular dysfunction or disorders. = In Canada = The Canadian Physiotherapy Association offers vestibular rehabilitation therapy courses, but does not recognize vestibular rehabilitation as a specialist certification. Similar to the ABPTS, the CPA's Clinical Specialty Program allows Canadian physiotherapists to specialize in neurosciences. Physical therapists with this specialization may be more equipped to administer vestibular treatment than those without it.

She became, thus, the first heroine of the independence of Brazil.http://www2.camara.leg.br/a-camara/visiteacamara/cultura-na- camara/arquivos/dois-de-julho-2014-a-independencia-do-brasil-na-bahia The nun became known as saying the famous phrase: ‚ÄúPara tr√°s, bandidos! Respeitai a casa de Deus! S√≥ entrar√£o passando por cima do meu cad√°ver! (Back off, bandits! Respect the house of God. You will only get in over my dead body!)‚Äù. However, an extensive document search concerning the life of Joana Angelica found no evidence that the phrase was in fact uttered by the sister.http://www.filologia.org.br/xv_cnlf/tomo_2/161.pdf  Early life and ordination  She was the daughter of Jos√© Tavares de Almeida and Catarina Maria da Silva, a rich family from Salvador. She was baptized at Freguezia da Santa F√©, at the Bahian capital. She was 20 years old when she was accepted, as an exception, to her novitiate in the Convent of Our Lady of the Conception of Lapa in 1782. Her profession of faith was made on May 18, 1783, when she joined the Order of the Reformed Religious of Our Lady of the Conception and was renamed Joana Angelica de Jesus. She remained secluded there for 20 years, and was a scribe, mistress of novices, counselor, vicar, and finally abbess, until her death.  Attack to the convent  left There are two conflicting versions of the episode of the attack on the Convent of Lapa. For the Brazilian historian Bernardino Jos√© de Souza, the Portuguese version, sponsored mainly by the Portuguese historian Jos√© d'Arriaga, has no support in documents. According to d'Ariaga's report, agents of the reactionary (pro- Independence) party had hidden in the convent and shot the soldiers inside the building. Brazilian historians, however, say that Portuguese troops broke in several buildings, practicing robberies and even deaths, under the pretext that shots had left from within a certain place; as had happened with the convent. The newspaper Di√°rio da Bahia published in its edition of July 2, 1936, a complete report on the attack on the convent and the sister's martyrdom. It contains a description of the political crisis and excesses committed by the Portuguese soldiers:http://hdl.handle.net/bv2julho/245 > The city is surprised by the designation of Madeira de Mello for the > commando of the Arms of the Province. Victorious, the commanders of Madeira > seize the city (...) hatred and revenge. Fires and looting. Savagery and > homicides. A solid colonial construction, still existing in the capital of Bahia, the Convent of Lapa consists of a cloister, whose main entrance is garrisoned by an iron gate. A group of soldiers tried to break into the gate while Joanna Angelica ordered the sisters to flee from the back. In order to protect the cloister and integrity of the sisters, Ang√©lica was placed as a last obstacle between the convent and the Portuguese troops. Resting place The remains of Joana Ang√©lica are found at the Convent of Lapa in close proximity to her place of death. A memorial housing her remains is located in a room to the rear of the name of the convent. Access The Church of the Blessed Sacrament of Saint Anne and memorial to Joana Ang√©lica are open to the public and may be visited; the convent and the site of martyrdom of Joana Ang√©lica are now a school and are closed to the public.

Despite the social pressures of normative feminine dress, some women, specifically those involved in the Women's Suffrage Movement, were intent on rebelling against the standards of women's dress. However, the 1920s was not the first decade to reject impractical female apparel. The Victorian dress reform paved the way for the more progressive and more politically aggressive women of the 1920s, though the validity of such reforms, the New Woman in particular, has been criticized for emphasis on female empowerment through dress and manner rather than political efforts‚Äìnoting a decline in American feminism in the 1930s and 1940s when fashions forged in the 1920s dress movement became more widely normalized and, in some ways, reverted to more restrictive dress and styles (see 1945‚Äì1960 in Western fashion). Despite the subsequent decline in feministic ideology, the women of the 1920s' changing attitudes, reflected in their choice of apparel, had a lasting impression on modern feminist ideals that resurged in the 50s and 60s. The New Woman's moxie was paradoxically evident in her lack of charm, exhibiting short bobbed haircuts, heavier makeup, and boyish frames. It may seem as though the flapper mirrored a rebellion against femininity, but it was actually quite the opposite; it was meant to make the modern woman's life easier. The flapper's simplistic, straight-lined style was popularized by Coco Chanel, who's somewhat ironically remembered as \\"fashionable without being forward,\\" as a way of liberating women the impractical designs that hindered modern women's ability to engage in physical activities. \\"The newfound freedom to breathe and walk encouraged movement out of the house, and the Flapper took full advantage.‚Äù Popular accessories now viewed as classics, such as strings of pearls and petite handbags, can also be traced back to the simplistic vision of Coco Chanel. Other successful accessory designers of the Roaring 20s include that of Cartier and \\"strap bracelets\\" and Miriam Haskell with her \\"fashion jewelry\\" (costume jewelry), but wealth wasn't a necessity for obtaining the flapper's look. Magazines provided sewing patterns to mimic chic Parisian trends, which fast-tracked the look's popularity by making them easily accessible to all those with a needle and thread, the common woman. However, while standardizing practical women's attire promoted movement, it was also seen as highly provocative, as the new dress (or lack thereof) served as a symbol of sexual freedom as well as an indicator of supposed declining morals. Flappers invested more importance on fun and panache than they did in moral character, idolizing figures such as Zelda Fitzgerald, wife of Modernist author F. Scott Fitzgerald, who was known for her flair, wit, and personal accomplishments as a writer and a professionally trained ballet dancer. Completing her own American novel, Save Me the Waltz, in 1932, Zelda epitomized the mantra that inspired the New Woman's change in apparel: that \\"a woman can do anything a man can do\\" without compromising her femininity. The flapper \\"smoked, drank, swore, drove fast, professed free love, and used makeup,\\" and exercised sexual independence‚Äìre-positioning herself as an indelible force in Western society.  Women's Dress and Activities Pre- Women's Suffrage  Amelia Bloomer, sporting her \\"freedom suit.\\" The women of the late 19th century changed their style from the big Victorian dresses to more ‚Äúmanageable, practical, streamlined outfits for modern women to engage in the activities of their more active lives.\\" Prior to the Women's Suffrage Movement, women were thought to be very fragile creatures so they were discouraged from playing sports.\\" However, with an increasing number of women protesting, there were more doctors who said that light physical activity for a woman was good. Because of this there was an increasing output of clothes to correspond, called rational dress. One specific piece of clothing was the sporting pantaloon or the women's bloomer. Originally worn in America in the 1850s as a women's suffrage statement by Amelia Bloomer, it turned into the ideal costume for women riding bicycles, an activity that was not too strenuous for women in the late 19th century. This was a piece of clothing for women and the beginning of women wearing pants. This piece of clothing was for sports and outdoor activity.  Accommodating the Emerging Modern Woman  Fashions at Nyngan Picnic races. Gladys Meacle, Mrs. T. Tighe, Vi Cleaver, Mrs. R. Fisher. circa 1927. Women in the 1910s across the world had to pick up what they were doing and go help in factories, supporting the jobs that their husbands no longer could do because of their involvement in World War I, sparking the dress reform in which some women activists argued that clothes should be worn for convenience rather than comfort. This led to more practical clothing for women working in factories. The fashion was less restrictive than the Victorian era dress and had much less fabric that allowed women to move more fluidly in their activity. The newly found freedom of women made more women start to dress like men in an article written by Laura Doan she examines the effect of women working increasingly in the field of the factory alongside the man domestically as well as abroad. More and more women started to take on very manly looks in their everyday lives. This is to say that some wore uniforms in order to work more efficiently. The great war had an impressive effect on women's fashion however many men still did not accept the new and changing woman as seen in political cartoon in Britain in which one girl is walking with another and one is wearing pants and the man continue to make jokes about it. Every woman wore accessories no matter your class or job. ‚ÄúFrom society lady to factory \\"girl,\\" every woman wore a hat, stockings, shoes, and gloves in all seasons.‚Äù  Women's Dress and Activities Post- Women's Suffrage  252x252pxDuring the progressive era the clothes changed along with ideas about women. Women in baseball during the progressive period tried out knickers for their uniform for a time. They first wore short skirts and long whole socks and then converted back to long skirts finally to rest upon knickers. Tennis was a sport that was appropriate for women to play, and in the early 1920s, there was a switch to more manageable clothing for women to wear. After the war and women's suffrage a new style came into play: the Flapper, much of which was influenced by film, radio, and women's newly found freedom to vote. This was an outfit that exposed the knee for the first time if stockings were worn, which was not always mandatory. This outfit was worn by young women in the 1920s and oftentimes was not approved of by older men and women of the time. The flapper was less of a style and more of a persona. It described a young revealing woman who did not have a lot of respect for the floor length skirt of yesterday. The flapper showed that women were able to express themselves more and show what they wanted to show of their bodies. Considering the lament in which the author of Flapper Jane describes the flapper, this style was most likely looked down upon by much of the societies in that time period.

At that time, she entered the grammar school of Grand Rapids, Michigan and made rapid progress in her studies. Two years later, her mother, who had married a second time, went to Dallas, Texas, because of failing health, and Callaway went to live permanently with her mother's sister, Mrs. R. A. Worden, of St. Clair, Michigan. She completed her student life in the public schools of that city, graduating from Battle Creek College the age of 17. Callaway was chosen class poet, and also wrote the poem for the alumni association. Her first efforts in writing for the press were for the Little Corporal magazine, when she was nine years old, and at that age, and a year later, she carried off the prizes offered by the Detroit Commercial-Advertiser for best compositions by children. Her first poems followed shortly after and won considerable editorial notice because of the unusually good character of the verse for one so young. Career =Teacher= After completing her schooling, Callaway became a teacher, part of the time in the schools from which she graduated. She followed this vocation until her marriage in 1844 to J. Weston Miner. Her husband being connected with the Battle Creek Review and Herald publishing house, Miner was engaged as a proof-reader, and finally as a writer, editing a large share of the work on a series of children's books issued from that office. She had always shown a predilection for writing both verse and prose. When teaching, she sometimes wrote stories or verses to reprove faults among her pupils that she preferred to correct in an impersonal way, and folding her pages in a newspaper read seemingly a printed article, so that no one mistrusted its origin. Still, to express herself in writing came so easily that until she was launched into it as an avocation unpremeditatedly, she had no thought herself that her ability in that direction would ever be of use, or was even worth cultivating. =Writer= During her engagement with the Review and Herald she wrote for the various publications of the house, and afterward, at their solicitation, collaborated with Myrta B. Castle on a series of children's books, chief among which being, Cats and Dogs, All Sorts for Children, and In Every Land. Immediately after they were published, she accepted an association with Emma L. Shaw, to assist Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and his wife, Ella Eaton Kellogg on their magazine, Good Health. The two years of Callaway's association with Shaw were of inestimable value. As Callaway became able to judge dispassionately and weigh her own abilities, she became convinced that she was best suited to active journalism. When she was offered a position on the Toledo, Ohio Commercial, she at once resigned and became connected with that paper. This position she held for two years. Miner removed to Dallas, Texas in 1893 or 1894. She separated from her husband during this move, and divorced him in 1895. She accepted a staff position with the Dallas News and the Galveston News, two of the best known of metropolitan newspapers in the southwest. She held the position of society and literary editor of the Dallas News, and editor of the woman's and children's departments of both the Dallas News and the Galveston News. Both these papers were under the same management, and by this connection Callaway placed herself in the front rank of women journalists in the south. During the period of 1889‚Äì1916, she used the pen name, \\"Pauline Periwinkle\\", when writing for The Dallas Morning News. This followed the tradition of alliterative pen names used by earlier women journalists such as Jane Cunningham Croly's \\"Jennie June\\". Writing on political questions and causes, Miner was a polemicist. She also pushed for women's education and woman's suffrage. But her \\"Women's Century\\" column was also described as \\"gossipy\\". S. Isadore Miner In the meantime, she did a lot of freelance work. She contributed both prose and verse to St. Nicholas Magazine, Wide Awake, Little Ones and the Nursery. She also did some syndicate writing for the leading newspapers. Some of her work was copied abroad, and one article in particular appeared in a leading German magazine, contributed by a well-known litt√©rateur of that country, and translated as \\"the best specimen of pathos by recent American writers.\\" Callaway's labors in behalf of the young were not restricted to newspaper work. Her productions in the field of juvenile literature were found in several of the prominent children's magazines of the day, and she wrote, with and without collaborators, seven books devoted to the instruction of children. During the vacation months of school children, she taught, through her columns, a \\"summer school,\\" on something of a simplified Chautauqua plan, keeping alive the children's interest in studies. Competitive examinations and the awarding of prizes gave zest to the plan and rendered it not only popular, but productive of the best results. Her pupils numbered by the hundreds. Callaway was a member of the State Press Association, of Texas; of the Texas Woman's Press Association, of which she was vice president; of the Toledo Press Club, and of the Michigan Woman's Press Association, which she helped to organize. She was also one of the organizers, and secretary of the Texas Woman's Council, by which she was chosen one of its delegates to the National Woman's Council. By 1904, she was converting women's social clubs into civic reform organizations. In 1900, she married William Allen Callaway. She died in Dallas, Texas, August 10, 1916, and was buried at Restland Memorial Park in that city.

It aired on October 3, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Tim Minear, and directed by Sheree Folkson. Plot Michael Langdon reminisces about his earlier life with a caretaker, Miriam Mead, a Satan-worshipper that had poisoned her last three husbands. Langdon says Mead made him feel happy and protected and tells robot Mead that he asked for her to have his caretaker's memories in order to guide him. Elsewhere in the Outpost, Myrtle Snow and Madison Montgomery explain to a resurrected Mallory and Coco that they had identity spells placed on them to protect them, blocking their memories of who they were. Cordelia Goode tells Mallory that she is special and that the witches need her to defeat Langdon. Langdon appears before the witches and gloats that he has already won. Langdon says that when he's done they will all wish they were still dead. Myrtle comments that she did not picture the world ending with \\"witches and warlocks.\\" Three years before the bomb hit, students at the Hawthorne School for Exceptional Young Men (that would later become Outpost 3) study magic with their instructor, Behold Chablis. Baldwin Pennypacker, John Henry Moore and Ariel Augustus, the Grand Chancellor, await Behold with a video featuring a young Langdon's execution of a Los Angeles Police detective during an interrogation after Langdon allegedly stabbed a man. Ariel believes that Langdon is a warlock, while Moore thinks it is a case of demonic possession. They consider a prophecy about an Alpha Warlock who could supplant the Supreme Witch, Cordelia. Ariel visits Langdon in jail, explaining that he was defending his caretaker from a callous butcher. Ariel releases Langdon from his cell and they leave for the school. Upon arrival, Ariel explains that it is underground because the original house above was destroyed by angry neighbors unhappy with the school's purpose revealed in the wake of Cordelia's \\"outing\\" the magical community three years prior. Ariel introduces him to the other students, telling them that they should make him feel as if this is his new, true home. One month later, the instructors are evaluating Langdon's power level. They hope he will rate a \\"level four\\", putting him on par with the female Supreme Witch. He exceeds the first test by not only locating a book hidden within a mirror, but retrieving it as well. Most are impressed, but Moore is troubled that he did not follow instructions. He similarly aces the examination by effortlessly teleporting throughout the room. Langdon then passes the third test by producing falling snow inside the room, which earns him further praise, but he nearly kills the examination board by freezing the room. At Miss Robichaux's Academy in New Orleans, Zoe Benson teaches students to change the color of a rose. Cordelia observes Mallory change the rose color to blue, then making the petals fall off and turn into butterflies. Myrtle enters, shaken, and announces that The Hawthorne School for Exceptional Young Men has called an emergency council session. Cordelia, Zoe and Myrtle travel to the Hawthorne School. At the meeting, Ariel explains that they wish Langdon to challenge Cordelia for Supremacy. While the women scoff at the idea of a male Supreme, Ariel insists that Cordelia administer the Seven Wonders to test Langdon. Cordelia refuses, saying that it would surely condemn the boy to death, as it did to witch Misty Day. Behold chastises her for abandoning coven member Queenie after her disappearance in Los Angeles, but Cordelia responds that she found Queenie's ghost in the Hotel Cortez, playing cards with the ghost of the hotel's founder James Patrick March. Unable to extract Queenie past the doors of the hotel, Cordelia realized that the Hotel Cortez was a demonic portal that she was unable to overcome. Ariel calls her a bigot for ignoring the possibility of an Alpha. Meanwhile, Langdon has a scrying vision of the Hotel Cortez. He travels to Los Angeles and successfully emerges from the hotel with Queenie. In the underworld, Madison experiences her own personal hell‚Äîprocessing endless returns and complaints from a never-ending line of customers at a department store. Langdon arrives and is surprised to see that Madison is self-aware of her afterlife existence. Queenie appears and explains to Madison how Langdon has travelled to the underworld to retrieve Madison. Langdon says he needs the two to prove a point. At the Hawthorne School, as Cordelia and the trio make plans to return to New Orleans, Cordelia experiences a strange feeling. As the women emerge outside, Langdon greets them on the surface with Queenie and Madison. Upon seeing the returned witches, Cordelia faints. Reception \\"Could It Be... Satan?\\" was watched by 2.02 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received positive reviews from critics, with Emma Roberts‚Äô performance being highlighted. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Could It Be... Satan?\\" holds an 88% approval rating, based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 7.53/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"Cast chemistry and just the right amount of self-effacing humor drive \\"Could it Be... Satan?\\" as worlds collide and fan dreams come true.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5, saying, \\"Coven was not my favorite series of American Horror Story, but it was one of the show's better ones and from the first bitchy comment flying out of Madison Montgomery's mouth, I am reminded why Coven is a fan favorite. The appearance of the witches immediately injects life into the series, and even when the show follows a group of warlocks that we've never known, there's immediate tension and chemistry between the group that betters anything we got with the mismatched group of survivors pre-Halloween.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. She was not impressed by the warlocks in general except by the council members, calling them \\"an all-star cast of Ryan Murphy faves\\". However, she appreciated the scenes with Queenie and Madison, but also the ending of the episode. Finally, she wondered what was the point of the episode title, as \\"Langdon is very clearly Satan or at least Satan-adjacent by a maximum of one degree\\". Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 2 out of 5, with a mixed review. Much like Rosenfield, she was not a big fan of the all-boys warlocks group, calling them a \\"circle-jerk of warlocks making paperweights\\", but admitted that their council members were \\"remarkably cast\\". She also criticized the gender binary between witches and warlocks, established by the episode. However, she still enjoyed Madison's personal hell scene.

It aired on October 10, 2018, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by John J. Gray, and directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton. Plot After passing out, Cordelia Goode experiences a hellish, nightmarish vision of a burnt and desolate world. She sees a demonic pale-faced man standing on the porch of the destroyed Miss Robichaux's Academy before she is attacked and devoured by a mob of disease-ridden cannibals while the man laughing maniacally. Cordelia awakens in shocks, she find herself in the Hawthorne School for Boys and joyfully greets Madison and Queenie. Cordelia details her apocalyptic vision to the other witches and warlocks. She agrees to administer the Seven Wonders for Michael Langdon so that he may rise to Supreme. Returning to New Orleans, Myrtle Snow chides Cordelia for allowing a man to take the position of Supreme, claiming that men make terrible leaders. She suggests that Cordelia select one of her own coven for Supreme, such as Mallory, who, as Myrtle witnessed, successfully healed the wounds of a dead deer and restored its youth. Cordelia confesses to Myrtle that she is dying. Her powers are beginning to fade, the sign that her reign as Supreme is coming to an end. Later, Cordelia meets with Coco St. Pierre Vanderbilt and her father (John Getz). Coco is a new student who can sense where danger is hidden, which manifests as the unimpressive skill of detecting gluten in food. She believes that coming to Miss Robichaux's is a waste of time, but Cordelia assures her that her powers will develop and grow. She asks Mallory to show Coco around the Academy. At the Hawthorne School, Ariel, Behold, John Henry and Baldwin cast a protection spell for Langdon in preparation for the Seven Wonders. Moore, believing that Langdon is the demonic man from Cordelia's vision after Langdon shows Moore a glimpse of his true form, becomes fearful and leaves the school to go to New Orleans, despite Behold's attempt to stop him. Whilst filling his car up at a petrol station, Miriam Mead pulls over and kills Moore before he can warn anyone. She meets up with Langdon outside the School. Miriam is excited to see him. Langdon aggressively asks if she took care of the problem. She confirms Moore is dead. Langdon says these people are the only ones that can pose a threat to him. When he becomes Supreme, he can destroy the coven from within and ascend to do \\"what he was born to do.\\" Miriam reveals that Ariel was in on the plan to kill Moore. He is the one that let her know when he was leaving the school. Langdon successfully passes six of the Seven Wonders. Before performing the seventh, descending to and returning from the underworld, Cordelia asks Langdon to not only return but to retrieve fellow witch Misty Day to see the extent of his powers. Ariel angrily accuses Cordelia of changing the rules in order for Langdon to fail, comparing her to her predecessor and mother, Fiona. Cordelia reminds Ariel that she is still Supreme and holds greater power over Ariel. Langdon agrees to the challenge. He travels to Hell and locates Misty, who has been trapped in her own personal hell of endlessly dissecting and resurrecting a frog in a science class. Langdon reawakens in the living realm with Misty materialising beside him. Langdon gloats over his achievements while Cordelia experiences a nosebleed. She proclaims Langdon the next Supreme. As Cordelia recovers, Misty confides in her that she should have been left where she was. Misty tells Cordelia that the evil within Hell appeared to speak to Langdon, which Cordelia assumes was negotiation for Misty's release. Misty then describes Langdon as wearing \\"the perfume of death.\\" Cordelia assures that she now has proof of Langdon's capacity for evil and rejoices that she now has all of her original sisters returned so that they may fight against Langdon in the upcoming apocalypse. Stevie Nicks arrives at the Hawthorne School and gives a special performance of 'Gypsy' for Misty. Cordelia pulls Madison aside and instructs her to gather information about Langdon. Behold, eavesdropping on the conversation, says that he will be joining Madison as he now has concerns of his own about Langdon. Cordelia asks Madison to travel to the place \\"where it all began\\": the Murder House. Reception \\"Boy Wonder\\" was watched by 2.12 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 1.0 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode has been critically acclaimed. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Boy Wonder\\" holds a 100% approval rating, based on 13 reviews with an average rating of 8.5/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"Classic characters returning, along with a peek back at Murder House and a Roanoke Easter egg, make \\"Boy Wonder\\" an episode of heightened returns‚Äînot to mention fantastical gore and camp.\\" Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a positive review, saying, \\"One of the best aspects about the addition of Coven to the Apocalypse grouping is the politics involved in the witch world. There are wheels within wheels, and plots within plots.\\" He added, \\"The scheming, as laid out in John J. Gray's script, is impressive indeed. Myrtle (the wonderful Frances Conroy) and Madison (Emma Roberts) pepper the script with fun, bitchy bon mots and asides. Michael and Ariel work their plot, the witches work their plot, and the clearly defined group dynamics end up muddled at the end of the episode, with various factions and sub factions squaring off with one another.\\" Kat Rosenfield from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B. She enjoyed the Seven Wonders sequence, commenting that it was \\"a campy throwback all the way to the golden age of silent cinema\\". Moreover, she really appreciated the cliffhanger, calling it \\"breathtaking\\", and the characters' outfits, particularly Madison's. She also supported and approved Myrtle Snow's feminist opinion about the role of Supreme. Vultures Ziwe Fumudoh gave the episode a 5 out of 5, with a positive review. She appreciated Paulson's performance, especially during the scene where Cordelia threatens Briones' Ariel. She also loved the cliffhanger of the episode, saying \\"this already very good season is about to get even better\\". Finally, she was a huge fan of Stevie Nicks' musical appearance, commenting \\"This is perfect casting. This is entertainment.

He led systematic efforts to kill the indigenous Caribs or drive them off the island. Settlement of Grenada On 17 March 1649 two barks under Governor Jacques Dyel du Parquet of Martinique arrived in Saint George's harbour, Grenada. 145 settlers landed and over the next eight days threw up a stockade they named Fort Annunciation on a site that Captain La Rivi√®re had previously explored. Du Parquet left on 6 April 1649 after appointing his cousin Jean Le Compte governor of Grenada. Le Comte was aged 55. The Island Caribs led by chief Chief Kairouane were a first suspicious of the settlers but not hostile. This changed in November 1649 when eleven large canoes arrived from Saint Vincent with several hundred warriors looking for revenge for an insult they had suffered in the Grenadines. The settlers retreated to the fort where they remained for eight days while the Caribs destroyed their property, and then left. Destruction of the indigenous people On 26 May 1650 du Parquet brought 300 men from Martinique to join the Grenada settlers in a surprise attack on the Caribs, who had been picking off isolated Frenchmen. A Carib defector led 60 French musketeers up a hill to surround about 80 Caribs who were sleeping beside a cliff. Caught in a crossfire, the Caribs who were not shot jumped from the cliff to their death. The site became known as the Morne des Sauteurs, or \\"Jumpers' Headland\\". Du Parquet had a second small fort, Fort Saint Jean, built and manned by 70 troops. He left the island on 7 June 1650. The Caribs of Grenada asked their kin in Dominica and Saint Vincent for help. This was the start of a war throughout the island. Some took refuge in the east coast mountains, but Le Comte raised a force of 150 men to hunt them out, and burned their houses and fields. The French destroyed the Carib pirogues to prevent them reaching other islands where they could take refuge or get help. La Comte himself drowned in a canoe accident. He died in 1654 and was succeeded as governor by Louis Cacqueray de Valmini√®re.

Crowdsource was released for Android on the Google Play store on August 29, 2016, and is also available on the web. Crowdsource includes a variety of short tasks users can complete to improve many of Google's different services. Such tasks include image label verification, sentiment evaluation, and translation validation. By completing these tasks, users provide Google with data to improve services such as Google Maps, Google Translate, and Android. As users complete tasks, they earn achievements including stats, badges, and certificates, which track their progress. Crowdsource was released quietly on the Google Play store, with no marketing from Google. It received mixed reviews on release, with many reviews stating that its lack of monetary rewards is unusual, as similar platforms, such as Google Opinion Rewards, often reward users with Play Store credits.  Features  Crowdsource includes different types of tasks, and these each provide Google with different information that it can give as training data to its machine learning algorithms. In the app's description on Google Play, Google refers to these tasks as \\"microtasks\\" which should take \\"no more than 5-10 seconds\\" to complete. = Tasks = Upon launch, the Crowdsource Android application presents users with 5 different tasks: image transcription, handwriting recognition, translation, translation validation, and map translation validation. The most recent version of the app includes 7 tasks: translation, translation validation, maps translation validation, handwriting recognition, sentiment evaluation, landmarks, and image transcription.  Translation and translation validation  Translation related tasks (translation and translation validation) are only shown to users who have selected more than one language they are fluent in. While Maps Translation validation is no longer a task in the Crowdsource Android app, users can still complete translation and translation validation tasks. Translation presents the user with one of the languages they listed themselves as fluent in, and asks them to translate it into another language they are fluent in. Translation validation presents users with a list of translations submitted by other users, and asks them to categorize them as correct or incorrect. Both of these tasks help improve Google's translating capabilities, most notably in Google Translate, and any other Google app with translated content, including Google Maps.  Image transcription  Image transcription allows users to select a word from a list of topics, such as \\"Baseball\\", and then presents the user with a picture, asking the question \\"Can Baseball be one of the labels for this image?\\". Users can select \\"Yes\\", \\"No\\", or \\"Skip\\" if they are unsure. The data gained from this task is used to help read text within images for services like Google Street View.  Handwriting recognition  Handwriting recognition relies on users to read handwritten words and transcribe them to text. According to Google, completing this task helps improve Google Keyboard's handwriting feature.  Sentiment evaluation  Sentiment evaluation presents the user with various reviews and comments, and asks them to describe the statement as \\"positive\\", \\"neutral\\", or \\"negative\\". Alternatively, users can skip a question if they are unsure. These evaluations by the users of Crowdsource help with various recommendation-based technologies that Google uses on platforms like Google Maps, the Google Play Store, and YouTube.  Landmark identification  This task asks users to confirm if a specific landmark is visible in pictures shown in the app. This task is designed to help ensure businesses and landmarks are recognizable in applications such as Google Maps. This task is now complete. = Achievements = Beyond the tasks that users can complete, the Crowdsource app has an \\"Achievements\\" section that shows users stats and badges which they earn through completing different tasks in Crowdsource.  Stats  When users contribute to Crowdsource by completing tasks, Crowdsource tracks their total number of contributions, as well as metrics like \\"upvotes\\" which show how many of a user's answers are \\"in agreement with answers from the Crowdsource community,\\" and \\"accuracy\\" which shows what percentage of the user's answers have been accepted as correct.  Badges  As users complete tasks, they also receive badges. There are badges for each type of task, which track progress along that particular task (such as translation validation), as well as badges for other milestones, like completing a task while offline or completing a task given through a push notification. = Updates = An April 2018 update to Crowdsource included a new \\"Image Capture\\" task in which users can take photos, tag them, and upload them to Crowdsource. Users can choose to open-source their images, as well, to share them with researchers and developers not exclusive to Google. In an interview with Wired Magazine, Anurag Batra, a product manager at Google who leads the Crowdsource team, said that the data gained from users completing this image capture task could improve Google's image search, camera apps, and Google Lens. The latest update adds a ‚Äòback‚Äô button to change your previous response. This change has not been ported to the web app.  Platforms  Crowdsource is also available as a web application. It offers many of the same tasks, such as image transcription, translation, and translation validation, and includes a page for users to view their achievements, much like the Android application. Unlike the Android version, the Crowdsource website includes a task for validation image captions, but does not have the handwriting recognition, sentiment evaluation, and image capture tasks available. The Crowdsource website also hosts a \\"Picture Quest Game\\", where two users see 2 pictures, only one of which is shared between the two users. The two players must communicate, asking each other questions about the image to determine which image is \\"shared\\" between them.  Reception  On release, many reviewers found the app's lack of monetary rewards unusual, due to the fact that Google has a similar app, Google Opinion Rewards, which offers Google Play store credits after completing short surveys. An August 2016 review from Android Pit noted that \\"this reliance on altruism [is] a little strange given that Google already has an app, Google Opinion Rewards, which has a financial incentive for user feedback. It works slightly differently, but I don't see why the same reward scheme could not be applied.\\" The review also expressed concern with this model, citing that users would be less likely to complete these tasks without more substantial rewards, writing that Crowdsource is \\"banking on the kind nature of its users\\", and asking \\"How are users, who generally want everything free and without adverts, going to respond to this in the long- term? Why would they rate this app highly, when the results are so nebulous?\\" A review from Wired shared similar concerns, writing \\"while Google is being open about its motivations, it will be difficult for users to know what difference their contributions make.\\" On Crowdsource's FAQ page, Google addresses this question of \\"Will I get paid for my answers?\\", answering, \\"No. Crowdsource is a community effort ‚Äì we rely on the goodwill of community members to help improve the quality of services such as Google Maps, Google Translate, and others, so that everybody in the world can benefit\\". In an August 2016 review, CNET noted that Google's statement in Crowdsource's description, \\"Every time you use it, you know that you've made the internet a better place for your community.\\", is not accurate, stating that Google does not offer free access to Google Maps and Google Translate data. A review from TechCrunch also noted that Crowdsource is \\"solely focused on helping Google improve its own services,\\" contrasting it with Amazon Mechanical Turk, which focuses on tasks from third parties.  Applications  An April 2018 interview in Wired stated that Google's machine learning algorithms work best in the United States and Western Europe, but are less effective in less prosperous countries. In this interview Anurag Batra, a product manager at Google who leads the Crowdsource team, shared Google's motivations behind the Crowdsource app, stating that Google has \\"very sparse training data set from parts of the world that are not the United States and Western Europe,‚Äù According to Wired, Google has a team that promotes the Crowdsource app in India and throughout Asia at colleges, and will likely expand to Latin America later in 2018. In a blog post on Local Guides Connect, Batra explains why Crowdsource is helpful to Google, detailing that the questions that Crowdsource asks users are designed to collect better samples of data to feed their machine learning algorithms. Google uses the answers provided by users of Crowdsource, and validates them by showing them anonymously to other Crowdsource users. According to Google, once answers are validated, they are used to \\"train computer algorithms that run services such as Google Translate, Google Maps, Android Keyboard, and others.\\" A brief on Cio Dive stated that an \\"accurate data set is critical\\" to the success of new technologies such as voice assistants and autonomous vehicles. The brief also notes that companies like Google and IBM are well positioned in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning due to the volume of data available to them to train and develop advanced AI.

The small domed church was designed by the late-Baroque architect Bernardo Antonio Vittone.  History  A community of Clarissan nuns was assembled in Bra by 1632, and were attended by a nearby church until this structure was built. Begun in 1742, it was consecrated for services by August 1, 1748. Work continued on the church until 1786. By 1802, the monastery was suppressed, and the property, including the church, was not returned to the nuns until 1816. The monastery was confiscated again in 1883. In 1930, the church was granted to the Capuchin Fathers, but finally passed to the Municipality of Bra. Santa Chiara has a four-lobed central plan set on large pillars that support a complex dome, perforated by windows. The altars were completed in the 20th century. The main altar is overlooked by a large stucco medallion depicting the Glory of the Eucharist with revering angels and nuns. The lateral altars (1943) were decorated by Piero Dalle Ceste. The altar on the left depicts the Immaculate Conception with three Franciscan saints Fedele da Sigmaringa, Veronica Giuliani, and Louis King of France; on the right, St Francis of Assisi in ecstasy. Di Pietro Paolo Operti (1704-1793) painted the frescoes on the second level. The dome was frescoed by Pietro Dalle Ceste, depicting St Francis blessing Saint Ignatius of Santhi√† and Cardinal Guglielmo Massaja. The main altar also has a painting by Giovanni Claret, depicting the Madonna with Child and Saint Joseph, with Saint Anthony of Padua, San Bernardino of Siena and San Diego d'Alcantara.City and Cathedral, regional tourism office for Piedmont and Val d'Aosta.

He is best known for demonstrating that cardiac muscle declines in efficiency as it fails, and for pioneering the use of isotopes to study electrolyte absorption in the small intestine. Early life and education Visscher was born on August 25, 1901 in Holland, Michigan. He was the fourth of six children in a Dutch Calvinist family. He attended Holland's Hope College, graduating in 1922, then studied physiology at the University of Minnesota where he earned a Ph.D. in 1925. He spent the next year doing research at the University of London with Ernest Starling. In 1926, he conducted physiological research with Anton Julius Carlson at the University of Chicago. He earned his M.D. from the University of Southern California in 1931. Academic career Visscher was an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee from 1927 to 1929. He joined the faculty of University of Southern California, where he was associate professor and chair of the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology from 1929 to 1931. He then served as the chairman of the physiology department at the University of Illinois College of Medicine until 1936, when he became the head of the physiology department at the University of Minnesota, a position he held until his retirement. Upon retiring in 1968, he became a Regents' Professor at the University of Minnesota, and was granted the status of emeritus professor in 1970. He then moved to another laboratory, where he continued to conduct research until his death. His doctoral students at the University of Minnesota included Gordon Moe and Earl Wood. Professional affiliations Visscher was the 20th president of the American Physiological Society, serving from 1948 to 1949. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1956. He also served as a co-founder and president of the National Society for Medical Research, as secretary general of the International Union of Physiological Sciences, and as founding chairman of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. Activism An outspoken humanist, Visscher contributed a regular column to The Humanist from 1942 to 1954 and signed the Humanist Manifesto II in 1973. He served as chairman of the organization Minnesotans against the War in Vietnam, which placed an anti- Vietnam War advertisement in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 1967. He was also an avid defender of academic freedom and opponent of McCarthyism. As a board member of the Unitarian Service Committee (USC) during World War II, he organized and headed the \\"Nutrition Mission\\", a collaborative mission between the USC and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The mission, launched in 1945, was aimed at researching malnutrition in Italy. He was a volunteer medical advisor to Group Health in the 1950s. Personal life Visscher married Gertrude Pieters on August 12, 1925. They had two sons and two daughters. Though raised a Calvinist, Visscher converted to Unitarianism in 1934, when he became a member of the Third Unitarian Church of Chicago. Nevertheless, he later credited the rigid doctrines of Calvinism with instilling a lifelong sense of urgency in him. He died of cancer on May 1, 1983.

At 9:10 AM EDT, Omar Santa Perez, 29, opened fire with a Taurus PT-809E 9mm pistol equipped with standard and hollow-point ammunition, in the lobby of the Fifth Third Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, killing three people. Incident Prior to the attack, Santa-Perez had entered a sandwich shop and potentially visited other businesses in the building, before returning to the bank and opening fire. Those killed in the attack were identified as two bank employees and a contractor. Two other victims were injured in the attack. Santa-Perez's gun reportedly jammed at least once during his shooting spree. When officers approached the lobby of the Fifth Third Center, they encountered an active shooter situation, with Santa-Perez firing into the lobby. Four of the responding officers engaged the shooter with their weapons, striking Santa- Perez multiple times. Body camera footage of the shooting released by the Cincinnati Police Department showed Santa-Perez indiscriminately shooting at any person he saw, and the gunman was later shot dead through a glass pane by police. The Hamilton County Coroner told reporters \\"He [Santa-Perez] had one weapon but a whole lot of rounds of ammunition. And he didn't hesitate. He didn't hesitate to pull the trigger, empty his magazine, release and do it again and again and again.\\" = Victims = One of the victims was reported deceased by first responders at the scene, while two others were declared deceased after arriving at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center. Two other victims were also transported, with one listed in critical condition and the other in fair. Investigation Speaking at a press conference, Cincinnati mayor John Cranley stated that initial reports appeared to show that the victims were shot at random and that, \\"it didn't appear to be a dispute between people.\\" During initial investigation, it was discovered by police that the shooter was carrying hundreds of rounds of ammunition and \\"...could've killed over 100 people.\\" Body camera footage was released by law enforcement on September 8, which documented the officers movements after confronting the gunman.

The second meeting took place in Budapest in 1971. The IWGP was partly founded in order to enable the compilation of archaeobotanical data.  Organisation  The IWGP takes place triennially. Papers from the conference were initially published in book form, including Plants and Ancient Man in 1984 and Old World Palaeoethnobotany in 1991. In 1992 the journal Vegetation History and Archaeobotany was founded and became the location for publication of papers emanating from the IWGP.

Kennedy's anti-poverty policies  Kennedy said little about poverty in his campaign, but began talking about unemployment in his first State of the Union address in January 1961. From his economic concerns, Kennedy created the Appalachian Regional Commission, VISTA, raised the minimum wage, and signed the Manpower Development and Training Act Journalism by Homer Bigart in 1962-1963 aroused Kennedy's concern for poverty in Appalachia, and he focused existing funds on pilot projects on the issue in 1963. In late 1963, Kennedy said \\"the time has come to organize a national assault on the causes of poverty, a comprehensive program.\\" In October 1963, Kennedy was planning a trip to bring national attention to rural poverty. The idea of the War on Poverty began emerging from the white house in 1963, but Congress was rejecting virtually all of Kennedy's domestic legislation proposals at the time. Kennedy strongly prioritized foreign policy in his concerns over his domestic agenda.  Area Redevelopment Administration  = Creation = Kennedy proposed and achieved passage of the Area Redevelopment Act, which provided federal funding to economically struggling regions of the country. The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394 million spending package passed in 1961, followed a strategy of investing in the private sector to stimulate new job creation. It specifically targeted businesses in urban and rural depressed areas and authorized $4.5 million annually over four years for vocational training programs. = Political impediments = On June 11, 1963, Kennedy delivered a Report to the American People on Civil Rights, proposing what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This aligned him with the civil rights movement, which he had earlier distanced himself from to avoid upsetting Southern legislators. Kennedy's action had the anticipated effect: a motion in the House of Representatives to boost funding to the Area Redevelopment Administration as requested by Kennedy suffered a surprising defeat, 209‚Äì204, because of the opposition of Southern Democrats. Their rejection of the bill was widely viewed as a revolt against the President for his stance on civil rights. In discussing the failure with House Majority Leader Carl Albert, Kennedy lamented, \\"Civil rights did it.\\" When historian and presidential adviser Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complemented Kennedy on his remarks, the latter bitterly replied, \\"Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House.\\" He then added, \\"But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did.\\" = Restructuring = The Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 reorganized the Areas Redevelopment Administration (ARA) into the Economic Development Administration (EDA), and authorized $3.3 billion over 5 years while specifying seven criteria for eligibility. The list included low median family income, but the 6% or higher unemployment applied to the greatest number of areas, while the Act also mentioned outmigration from rural areas as a criterion. In an attempt to go beyond what one writer described as \\"ARA‚Äôs failed scattershot approach\\" of providing aid to individual counties and inspired by the European model of regional development, the EDA encouraged counties to form Economic Development Districts (EDDs) as it was recognized that individual distressed counties (called RAs or Redevelopment Areas) lacked sufficient resources for their own development.

After passing her examination in 1928, she was refused a license to practice because women were not citizens at that time and could not complete the mandatory military service. International pressure was brought to bear and she finally earned her license in 1929. Ten years later when she passed examination to become a trial lawyer, the Supreme Court again refused to issue a license on the basis that women were incapable of practicing law. She successfully earned her license within a month and practiced until her untimely death from a traffic accident. Early life Esilda Villa Laguna Michel, 1st woman lawyer in Bolivia Esilda Villa Laguna Michel was born on 18 December 1909 in Sucre, Bolivia to Adela Michel and Eduardo Villa Laguna. At the age of four, she entered primary school in the city of Potos√≠. Because of her excellent performance, she was able to skip her final year of primary schooling and at 12 years old, moved to Oruro, enrolling in the secondary school, Liceo \\"Pantale√≥n Dalence\\" de Se√±oritas (Pantale√≥n Dalence Women's Lyceum) graduating with a specialization in science and letters. Though she wanted to study law, there was no law school in Oruro which would accept women, so joining with other graduates of her generation, they founded the Facultad Libre de Derecho (Free Faculty of Rights). After studying for two years, on 2 June 1928, she appeared before the Superior Court of the District of Oruro, to take the examination for Procuradora de Causas. Having never before had a woman apply, the court examined Villa and confirmed that she met the requirements. When the Superior Court subsequently applied to the Government Prosecutor's Office for her certification as a procuradora, the application was denied on the basis that as a woman, she was not a citizen and could not be licensed without having completed her mandatory military service. In a Ministerial Resolution dated 10 October 1928 they refused to grant Villa a license. The action by the Ministry, began a long campaign by Villa for the advancement of women's rights in Bolivia. She brought numerous petitions before the Senate of Bolivia arguing not only for the political rights of women, but their civic right to engage in professions. Simultaneously, she appeared at the military barracks and demanded to be enrolled as a conscript. When the commandant refused, she demanded that he provide her with a certificate of disability, which allowed men to enter professions without fulfillment of military service. Her battle was carried in major newspapers throughout South America in Argentina, Chile, Cuba and Peru, among others, and she was often ridiculed for her masculine behavior in the humor section. One edition of the Chilean El Mercurio speculated whether she had a beard. The international attention, including a petition presented on her behalf to the General Assembly of the Pan American Union by the Inter-American Commission of Women, pressured the Prosecutor's Office to reverse their decision and grant her the title of procuradora on 2 March 1929. Career News of Villa becoming the first woman lawyer of Bolivia was published in feminist journals and carried in the Bulletin of the Pan American Union. Over the next ten years, she worked with the attorneys and inmates in the Public Prison. During the Chaco War (1932‚Äì1935), she trained as a nurse and provided aid on the battlefield to the wounded. On 2 January 1938, Villa returned to the Superior Court in Oruro to request her examination as a trial lawyer (abogado). Again, she passed the examination, but when she applied for her new license, Villa was advised that under Article 15 of the Law of Judicial Organization confirmed by the Supreme Court of Bolivia, women, as well as people who were deaf or unable to speak were barred from becoming trial lawyers. Once again, she fought the ruling and was finally awarded her license on 22 January 1938. Villa was involved in the founding of the children's wing of the Public Hospital and established a first aid room at the Escuela \\"Mar√≠a Quiroz\\". She campaigned for housing for the children of prison inmates who had no relatives to care for them and drafted legal opinions on the rights of children. In 1936, at the First Feminist Congress of Bolivia, held in Cochabamba, she delivered two papers, one which advocated for paternity investigations to confirm support for children by their fathers and another which argued that the law should protect children. She favored legal protection for single mothers allowing them to serve as guardians of their own children, child support by absent fathers, and access to education and health care. In July 1946, when the coups d'√©tat overthrew the presidency of Gualberto Villarroel, Villa heard an announcement on the radio pleading for medical supplies for people wounded in the rebellion. She organized supplies and medical aid to be shipped to citizens in La Paz over the Bolivian Railway system. Death and legacy Villa died on 11 May 1947, in a car accident when returning from the dedication of a monument to the victims who died in the revolt of 20 November 1944, in Oruro and a tribute in her honor was held at the La Paz Cathedral.

Multilingual in Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwa (or Chippewa), English and French, Robinson also helped evacuate survivors of the Fort Dearborn Massacre in 1812.Ann Durkin Keating, Rising Up from Indian Country: the Battle of Fort Dearborn and the Birth of Chicago (University of Chicago Press, 2012), pp. 67-68 In 1816, Robinson was a translator for native peoples during the Treaty of St. Louis. He became a Potawatomi chief in 1829 and in that year and in 1833, he and fellow Metis Billy Caldwell negotiated treaties on behalf of the United Nations of Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi with the United States. Although Robinson helped lead Native Americans across the Mississippi River in 1835, unlike Caldwell, Robinson returned to the Chicago area by 1840 and lived as a respected citizen in western Cook County until his death decades later. Early and family life Born to an Ottawa mother and a Scots-Irish immigrant fur trader father on Mackinac Island (a/k/a Michilimackinac) at the northern edge of Lake Michigan. His mother died shortly thereafter en route to Montreal, Canada, where Robinson was baptized at age seven months on May 15, 1788. A British soldier who served as the island's Governor, Daniel Robinson, and his wife Charlotte Ferly became his foster parents. As described below, as a young man Robinson would be apprenticed to a fur trader further south in Michigan, Joseph Bailly, where he learned the fur trade but not how to read and write in any European language, instead devising a script to keep his accounts. Robinson first married a Menominee woman, Okemawabon (incorrect) (a/k/a Cynthia (incorrect) Josephine or \\"Sahsos})(1800-). To Note: Sasus -aka- Josephine Little Wolf's parents were: Okimaw (means Chief) Mahwaeseh & Oneesis, they were both full blood Menominee Indians. Okimaw Mahwaseh was a noted War Chief of the Menominee Indian Tribe of WI. Their children included Joseph Franklin Robinson and daughter Wakohwapeh (a/k/a \\"White Fox\\" or Margaret) Robinson, married name Kitson (1821-1904). Chief Kewascum of the Potatawatomie may have been another son of Cheecheepinquay & Sasus. In Chicago (then in Peoria County, Illinois) on September 28, 1826, Robinson married Catherine Chevalier (d. 1860), trader John Kinzie officiating as Justice of the Peace. Chevalier was the granddaughter of the Potawatomi warrier Naunongee (who died in the Battle of Fort Dearborn), specifically of his daughter Chopa (a/k/a \\"Marianne\\") and her husband Francois Chevalier, all of whom lived in the Calumet/Fox River area. Francois Chevalier became chief of the village near Lake Calumet in southern Cook County, Illinois after his father-in-law's death. Her sister Josette had married Jean Baptiste Beaubien, who had also learned the fur trade from Bailly, and her sister Archange married trader Antoine Ouilmette. Father Stephen Badin would baptize several of Alexander and Catherine Robinson's children during his visits to the Chicago area. Career By the time Robinson was 11, he was working for British fur trader Joseph Bailly, who at the time traded with the Ottawa people in what became Michigan, including near the St. Joseph River which empties into Lake Michigan. Robinson never learned to read and write a European language, but kept accurate accounts in characters of his own devising. By 1809 Robinson had traveled along Lake Michigan's southern shore to what later became Chicago on Bailly's behalf to purchase grain. By 1812, Robinson had built a house on the south branch of the Chicago River, next to the LaFramboise family at a settlement sometimes called Hardscrabble or the Leigh Farm. Not far away and more than a decade earlier, various metis had built a settlement on the river's north bank. Trader Jean Lalime had built a house and outbuildings, which were purchased by Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, who in turn sold them to American trader John Kinzie in 1804. Kinzie and his wife Eleanor (who had spent several years as a captive of the Seneca in Pennsylvania) lived next to his subordinate Antoine Ouilmette and his Potawatomi wife, the former Archange Chevalier.Keating p. 68 =Fort Dearborn= Commemorative bridge plaque After the Fort Dearborn massacre of 1812, Robinson (who had just returned from a trip to Bailly's trading post) with Black Partridge, Waubonsie and Shabbona protected Kinzie and his family from hostile Wabash warriors. Robinson transported (by canoe) the Kinzie family to what became Chesterton, Indiana and the protection of (or house arrest under) Topinabee.Keating p. 160Joseph Kirkland, The Chicago massacre of 1812 (1893) available at https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt/search?q1=robinson;id=loc.ark%3A%2F13960%2Ft9w094m3x For the then-significant sum of $100, Robinson also undertook the dangerous mission of transporting the wounded U.S. Captain Nathan Heald and his wife Rebekah Wells (daughter of former Indian Agent William Wells who died in the massacre) and Sergeant William Griffith by canoe (over two weeks) to the British fort on Mackinac Island, from where they eventually reached British- occupied Detroit, then Buffalo.Gillum Ferguson, Illinois in the War of 1812 (University of Illinois Press, 2012) pp. 61, 71Keating p. 164 Later, in 1814, Kinzie's half brother Robert Forsyth and other Americans would capture Bailly and three other pro-British traders at the St. Joseph River post, then Kinzie and his aide Jean Baptiste Chandonnai persuaded native leaders to an American- led conference at Greenville, Ohio which led to a treaty ending hostilities in the region. Retrospective map showing how Chicago may have appeared in 1812(right is north) Although Fort Dearborn had been destroyed shortly after the battle, Robinson and fellow trader Ouilmette farmed there before the fort was rebuilt in 1816. They then sold produce to the U.S. Army.Keating p. 205 Perhaps as early as 1814, and until 1825, Robinson had a trading post and farm somewhat away from the fort at Hardscrabble near the Chicago Portage. (After his release, Bially would establish the Joseph Bailly Homestead in what would later become the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore). During this period Robinson worked for various companies, including the American Fur Company under John Crafts and later the returned John Kinzie, until 1828 when Kinzie died and the American Fur Company left the region since fur-bearing animals had vanished not long after development of the steel trap. Late in that decade, Robinson also had a trading post at Wolf Point, and later had a tavern in Cook County. Fort Dearborn as rebuilt in 1816 =Treaty signatory= In 1816, because of his linguistic abilities, Robinson translated for various tribal chiefs in what became the Treaty of St. Louis, which modified the demarcation between lands open for white settlement and Indian Country set in the 1795 and 1814 Treaties of Greenville. This 1816 treaty became the first in which the Potawatomi sold land near their villages, in exchange receiving $1000 in merchandise annually for twelve years. Although the Greenville treaty only ceded the immediate area of Fort Dearborn for white settlement, further settlement would be authorized in the 1821 Treaty of Chicago. left As Indian Agent for the Great Lakes region, Dr. Alexander Wolcott Jr. facilitated the election of Robinson and his part-Potawatomi (some argue part-Mohawk) friend Billy Caldwell (who had fought for the British in the War of 1812) as Potawatomi chiefs by 1829 to fill vacant positions (Robinson succeeded his father-in-law Chevalier), so the Three Fires (or United Nations) Tribes could sign further cession treaties.Peter T. Gayford,Billy Caldwell: An Updated History, Part 2 (Indian Affairs) Chicago History Journal, July 2011, accessed 25 Sept 2018 at https://web.archive.org/web/20110830115031/http://www.chicagohistoryjournal.com/2011/07/billy- caldwell-updated-history-part-2.html The two mixed-race men thus represented the Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi peoples in negotiating the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien with the United States. By that year, the U.S. was working on Indian Removal as advocated by President Andrew Jackson; Congress soon passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 to authorize the process. For his work in obtaining the 1829 treaty, the U.S. granted Robinson $200 annually and a 1600-acre tract, known as the Robinson Reserve, along the Des Plaines River but adjoining Caldwell's reserve along the North Branch of the Chicago River.Keating p. 207 In the Blackhawk War of 1832, Robinson, Waubonsie and Aptakisic kept all the young warriors encamped near what became Riverside, Illinois as the womenfolk continued to farm; thus avoiding involvement in the conflict.Keating p. 227 Caldwell, despite helping the British in the prior conflict, led other Potawatomi as scouts to assist the U.S. Army. Robinson and Caldwell also negotiated the Treaty of Chicago in 1833 after natives lost the Blackhawk War. Wolcott had died and Thomas Owen became Indian Agent until that office closed in 1835. The treaty technically exchanged five million acres of Indian lands northeast of the Mississippi River for roughly equal acreage west of the river, with additional compensation.Keating p. 229 In fact, it led to the final Indian Removal from the region, although some like Robinson negotiated a right to remain on their property. Circa 1835, he and Caldwell migrated with their people from the Chicago region westward to Platte County, Missouri, but as Robinson returned to his reservation near Chicago, Caldwell, Shabbona and their people would later be moved again.Helen Hornbeck Tanner, \\"Treaties\\", Encyclopedia of Chicago, 2005, 25 Sept 2018 The 1833 treaty initially provided Caldwell and Robinson each with $10,000, as well as a $400 lifetime annuity for Caldwell, and a $300 annually for Robinson, among other specific provisions. Before the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1835, it reduced the two men's lump-sum payments to $5000 each, but left their annuities intact.Peter T. Gayford, Billy Caldwell: An Updated History, Part 3 (The Reserve and Death),Chicago History Journal, (August 2011), available at https://web.archive.org/web/20110814181424/http://www.chicagohistoryjournal.com/2011/08/billy- caldwell-updated-history-part-3.html Robinson and some other M√©tis remained in or returned to Illinois on their private tracts of land, but most of the United Nations Tribes removed to Missouri and then to Iowa.R. David Edmunds, \\"Potowatomis\\", Encyclopedia of Chicago, accessed 25 Sept 2018 =Later years= By 1840, Robinson returned to the Chicago area,1840 Illinois Census for Munroe Precinct of Cook County not available online although he would later make visits to Kansas, as well as continue to entertain visiting Native Americans on his land.Keating p. 232 By 1845 he built a house on the Robinson Reserve in what later became Schiller Park near the future O'Hare Airport, and family members would also build nearby. In the 1850 census, Robinson farmed in what became Leyden Township and lived with his wife and some of their 11 children, including adult sons Joseph Robinson (1828-1884) and David Robinson (1830-1863) and daughters Cinthia Robinson (1837-) and their youngest, Mary Ann Robinson Ragor (1839-1904).1850 U.S. Federal Census for Leyden Township, Cook County, Illinois family 1250. He had become a gentlemen farmer, although his children by his first wife remained to the north, and others moved out of the Chicago area. To note: Sasus the first wife was a full blood Menominee Indian she moved to the Menominee Indian Reservation most likely around 1854 or afterwards when the last treaty w/the Menominee was signed. Cheecheepinquay & Sasus daughter Wakohwapeh aka Margaret Robinson also moved with her Mother up North as referred above info. Up North meaning the Menominee Indian Reservation, where there are numerous descendants. His son David Robinson would die as a Union private in a military hospital in Murfreesboro, Tennessee during the American Civil War, but Robinson continued to regale visitors about meeting Abraham Lincoln long before. After the Great Chicago Fire, Robinson returned to the city to view the scene from the Lake Street bridge, reportedly exclaiming \\"Once more I can see the prairie of the past.\\" Eventually, his youngest child, Mary Ann Robinson Ragor became the family matriarch into the 20th century. Death and legacy Robinson briefly returned to view Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire and compared it to the prairie of his youth. He died on his land on April 22, 1872, survived by his widow, as well as several children and grandchildren, and was buried in the family graveyard.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/22414196/alexander-robinson Part of the Robinson Reserve, including a burial ground for many Native Americans, was never sold until acquired by the Cook County Forest Preserve District in 1955 after Robinson's house burned down and his granddaughter Mary Boettcher (who had preserved the area for decades) could not rebuild. The Forest Preserve District forbad further family burials in 1973; Robinson's gravestone was removed to a maintenance facility and lost for many years before being returned to descendants in 2016. Litigation concerning the condemnation may be ongoing. The old burial ground has become associated with ghost legends, hence the closest parking lot is now closed. In 1940, as part of the Treasury Relief Project, Federal Writers Project supervisor George Melville Smith (1879-1979) painted \\"Indians Cede the Land\\", a mural for the Park Ridge, Illinois post office. It may depict a younger Robinson among the Native Americans at the negotiations. Park Ridge was developed on one of the three former Potawatomi villages in the area, as was Forest Glen in Caldwell's Reserve, and either was once part of or adjoins the Robinson Reserve. Removed during post office renovations in 1970, it was restored in 2008 and placed in the Park Ridge Public Library in its 100th anniversary celebration, although temporarily removed during 2018 renovations.

Early life Van den Heuvel was born on December 23, 1742 in Maastricht in the province of Limburg, Netherlands. He was the son of Abraham van den Heuvel and Jacoba Johanna Henrietta Hesselt (n√©e van Dinter). His paternal grandparents were Jacob van den Heuvel and Hermanna Henrica Cuper. His maternal grandparents were Andres Matthias Hesfelt van Dinter and Jacoba Henrietta Martini. Career The Demerara colony in 1759 (East is at the top). In 1765, Van den Heuvel was appointed Commander (an equivalent to the colonial governor) of Demerara, which was a historical region in the Guianas on the north coast of South America (which is now part of the country of Guyana) located around the lower courses of the Demerara River. In Demerara, he owned two plantations. At the time, it had been a Dutch colony since 1745 when it was separated from Essequibo. Van den Heuvel served until 1770 Demerara would remain mostly under Dutch rule until around 1812 when it merged into Demerara-Essequibo and was ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain, becoming known as the county of British Guiana from 1838 to 1966. Its main town was Georgetown (which was known as Stabroek during Dutch rule). =Life in America= In 1790, due to the outbreak of yellow fever, he moved to New York City, first at 87 Liberty Street, as a merchant with the Dutch West India Company. In 1800, he moved to the corner of Broadway and Barclay Streets (which is the present site of the Woolworth Building).

In 1971, NASCAR leased its naming rights to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company who named the series after its premier brand \\"Winston\\". The series was referred to as the NASCAR Winston Cup Series from that point forward. Many view the Winston Cup Series Era as a time in which NASCAR entered the modern era of spectator sports. During this era, NASCAR experienced a significant rise in popularity that persisted until Winston left the sport after the 2003 season.  1971‚Äì1979  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company Logo In 1971, NASCAR was courting the tobacco giant, R.J. Reynolds Company about sponsoring the entire NASCAR Grand National series. Due to a new congressional mandate, the tobacco companies were no longer able to advertise on television. As a result of the legislation, Reynolds Co. had a massive advertising budget a lot of which went to auto racing starting in 1971. The tobacco company saw a major potential advertising base that could offset the loss of television commercials. The new name of NASCAR's premier stock car racing tour became the \\"Winston Cup Grand National Series.\\" During the Winston Cup Era, NASCAR experienced a significant rise in national prominence. One example is the 1979 Daytona 500 which was the first race of its kind to be broadcast to a national television audience from start to finish. On the final lap of the 1979 Daytona 500, Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough crashed allowing Richard Petty to take the victory. After the race, Donnie Allison along with his brother Bobby got into a fight with Yarborough on the backstretch. Millions observed this encounter on live television helping NASCAR enter a niche in spectator sports once held exclusively by other events. Plymouth's final season was 1977 and American Motors' final season was 1978.  1980‚Äì1989  Ronald Reagan with Richard Petty On July 4, 1984, President Ronald Reagan became the first sitting president to attend a NASCAR race when he watched the \\"King\\" Richard Petty win the 1984 Firecracker 400. Some look to moments such as these to suggest that the Winston Cup Era marked the time in which NASCAR officially appeared on the national stage in America. The Firecracker 400 was Petty's 200th and final Winston Cup victory. In that same year, Terry Labonte captured his first Winston Cup Series Championship driving the No. 44 Piedmont Airlines Chevrolet Monte Carlo. In 1985, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company introduced a concept called \\"The Winston Million.\\" This idea entailed a million-dollar prize to be awarded to any driver that won three out of four major races during the 1985 season. Those races were the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, the World 600, and the Southern 500. Bill Elliott would become the first driver to win \\"The Winston Million\\" after he won the Daytona 500, the Winston 500, and the Southern 500 in 1985 in the #9 Coors Ford Thunderbird. Later, R.J. Reynolds would go on to create an \\"all-star\\" prize referred to as \\"The Winston\\" in 1985. This prize would award the winner a check for $200,000. This development set a precedent for significant cash prizes for winners of NASCAR events and funneled an increasing amount of cash flow into the sport. Darrell Waltrip was the first to be awarded \\"The Winston\\" at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Waltrip won his first and only Daytona 500 in 1989 driving the #17 Tide Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Hendrick Motorsports. Chrysler and Dodge ceased participation after the 1985 season. Mercury's final season was 1980. In 1988, amid fears of a hostile takeover within Goodyear, Hoosier Racing Tire entered the Winston Cup Series, sparking the first of two tire wars in the sport. The season saw a war of attrition among teams, as tire failures from both tire manufacturers resulted in horrific crashes and numerous driver injuries. By the end of the season, Hoosier claimed nine victories out of the 28 races. In 1989, after a botched attempt at Daytona, Goodyear officially unveiled their new radial tires at North Wilkesboro Speedway to combat Hoosier's bias-ply tires. After Dale Earnhardt won the race on Goodyears, interest in Hoosier waned until the company left NASCAR after the Winston 500 at Talladega, ending the tire war.  1990‚Äì1999  Dale Earnhardt At the 1990 Daytona 500, Earnhardt led 155 of the 200 laps when he not only ran over a piece of metal on the backstretch but also popped a tire on the final lap. Derrike Cope, driving the No. 10 Purolator Chevy Lumina, was able to pass Earnhardt and win the 32nd annual running of the Daytona 500. During the 1991 Winston Cup season, Harry Gant driver of the #33 Skoal Oldsmobile swept the races at Darlington, Richmond, Dover, and Martinsville going undefeated in the month of September. Gant was nicknamed \\"Mr. September\\" for this historic winning streak. Five drivers were still in contention for the Winston Cup Championship going into the season finale at Atlanta Motor Speedway in 1992. Alan Kulwicki, Bill Elliott, Davey Allison, Kyle Petty, and Mark Martin were all fighting for the championship during the 1992 Hooters 500. Bill Elliott won the race, but Alan Kulwicki captured the championship by a slim ten-point margin. This race would also be the final Winston Cup race for the \\"King\\" Richard Petty ending an era of Petty fandom. General Motors brand Buick left the series after the 1992 season and fellow GM brand Oldsmobile departed after 1994, leaving Chevrolet, Ford and Pontiac as the remaining manufacturers. Hoosier re-entered the Winston Cup Series in 1994 for its second tire war with Goodyear. Their return was marred by the practice crash deaths of Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr at Daytona, as both cars were on Hoosiers and the media was quick to blame the tire manufacturer. Despite four wins with Geoff Bodine, Hoosier once again struggled to gain interest from other drivers and left NASCAR for good at the end of the season. Earnhardt won his seventh and final Winston Cup Championship in 1994 and his long-awaited Daytona 500 victory in 1998, assisting to his rise to national recognition as well as the recognition of the Winston series in general. The \\"Iceman\\" Terry Labonte won the Winston Cup Series Championship for the second and final time in 1996 driving for Hendrick Motorsports. Various other racers won the series in the subsequent years prior to the decline of the series after turn of the century.  2000‚Äì2003  Dale Earnhardt Jr., son of the now iconic Dale Earnhardt, took home his first career victory in 2000 at Texas Motor Speedway in the #8 Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Joe Gibbs, acing driver Bobby Labonte, captured the 2000 Winston Cup Series Championship in his #18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix. The Winston Cup Series began to decline in national admiration during a fatal crash during the 2001 Daytona 500. Dale Earnhardt and Sterling Marlin were competing for third place in the 2001 Daytona 500 on the final lap when the crash took place. Earnhardt's car sped up the racetrack into Ken Schrader's M&M;'s Pontiac, the two cars slammed into the outside wall. Earnhardt's car hit Schrader's head-on. Earnhardt was severely injured in the crash and was later pronounced dead at 5:16 P.M. Michael Waltrip, the driver of the #15 Napa Auto Parts Chevrolet Monte Carlo, won the 2001 Daytona 500. Dale Earnhardt Incorporated driver Steve Park won the race at Rockingham one week after his boss Dale Earnhardt died in the 2001 Daytona 500. Dodge also re-entered the series in 2001 after being absent since 1985. In 2003, Ricky Craven, driver of the #32 Tide Pontiac Grand Prix, finished .002 seconds ahead of Kurt Busch to win Carolina Dodge Dealers 400. It was the closest recorded finish in NASCAR history and gained national attention. It was also the last win for the Pontiac marque, as General Motors withdrew the brand at the end of the season. There were fifteen different series champions during the Winston Cup Series era. Seventy different drivers won at least one race during the Winston Cup Era. The time period encompassed a significant rise in NASCAR viewership while also marking the beginning of a significant decline in NASCAR popularity that would continue over the next decade.

History The park was built as Munich was expanding north from Maxvorstadt in the early 20th century, in order to preserve green space in the growing city. It was named in honor of the Bavarian Prince Regent Luitpold in 1911 to commemorate the prince's 90th birthday. It is in size. The park is accessible from the Scheidplatz underground station. On a clear day, it is possible to see the Alps from the park. Features Pumuckl fountain A distinctive feature of the park is the Luitpoldh√ºgel, a hill consisting of rubble piled up from World War II bombing attacks on the city. In 1949, following the war, a plain cross was erected on top of the hill, with an inscription reading, \\"Pray for and remember all of those who died under the mountains of rubble\\". In 1952, this became a permanent memorial. The (Bamberg House) sits at the western end of the park. It opened in 1911 as a cafe and was named after its design, which was modelled on a house in Bamberg. The site was bombed during World War II and rebuilt in the 1980s. There is a hedge maze adjacent to the house. The Pumuckl fountain in the park is named after the eponymous character created by Ellis Kaut. The figure intermittently spits out water, which may unexpectedly soak park guests. The park is also known for its old trees, and is lined with ginkgo and pyramidal oak trees, among others. At the park's opening, the central feature was a obelisk constructed from limestone from the nearby district of Lower Franconia, surrounded by 90 lime trees, one for each year of Luitpold's life, and 25 oak trees. Events The park remains popular and has hosted numerous festivals and events. In the winter, the steep hills in the park are popular for sledding.

It was published by DC Comics as a three-issue limited series from December 1988 to February 1989, and was later reprinted in trade paperback form. Black Orchid follows two girls, Flora and Suzy, who awaken in a greenhouse. Their journey to find out who they are leads them into contact with DC Universe figures like Batman and Swamp Thing, but also into conflict with criminal mastermind Lex Luthor, who seeks them for his own interests. Gaiman and McKean developed the series after meeting with Jenette Kahn, Dick Giordano, and Karen Berger in early 1987. The two pitched several ideas for series, but were ultimately assigned Black Orchid because all other characters they wanted to work on were in use at the time. They produced the series' concept within two days and won approval from DC Comics. DC nearly canceled the series due to fears would fail commercially, but relented after McKean finished the art. Gaiman later reworked some cut characters and concepts into a pitch for a new series, which became his critically acclaimed Sandman. Despite DC's concerns, Black Orchid sold well and was positively received. Critics feel the story has held up well for one of Gaiman's earliest works. Black Orchid helped bolster Gaiman's career and established many themes that became common in his later stories. It also inspired a short-lived ongoing series published under DC's alternative imprint Vertigo from September 1993 to June 1995.  Publication history  = Background = The superhero Black Orchid was created by Sheldon Mayer and first appeared in Adventure Comics #428 (June 1973), published by DC Comics. She was the first superhero to debut as the cover feature of the series since Starman in 1941; she was not given an origin story and her personal life was not shown. After a three-issue run in Adventure Comics, Black Orchid quickly faded into obscurity, but sporadically made guest appearances in other DC publications. Neil Gaiman is a popular British author who has written comics for numerous publishers. However, he is best known for his work at DC, which includes high-profile comics like Batman, The Books of Magic, and The Sandman. Gaiman had wanted to write comics since he was a child, but became especially interested after forming a friendship with Alan Moore in the 1980s. Gaiman's first comics were published in 2000 A.D., but he quit after his third piece came out, upset that his artist ignored most of his script directions. Gaiman met painter Dave McKean while working on an unreleased comic called Borderline; the two then went on to produce Violent Cases. = Development = In early 1987, Gaiman learned that DC's president Jenette Kahn, executive editor Dick Giordano, and editor Karen Berger were in London, so he managed to scheduled an appointment with them. Gaiman and McKean pitched series featuring John Constantine, the Sandman, the Phantom Stranger, and Green Arrow, among others. At the time, Jamie Delano had been developing the Constantine series Hellblazer, the Sandman was appearing in Justice Society of America, a Phantom Stranger limited series was in production, and Mike Grell was writing a Green Arrow series. Eventually, Gaiman got to the character at the bottom of his list, Black Orchid. Upon hearing the name, Berger, who did not know who Black Orchid was and misunderstood Gaiman because of his accent, asked \\"Blackhawk Kid? Who's he?\\" Giordano, on the other hand, knew who she was and gave Gaiman and McKean his approval. As they walked away, McKean expressed disappointment that they were assigned Black Orchid, as he wished to produce a comic featuring Swamp Thing and rainforests. Gaiman promised McKean he would include them in the story. He was motivated by Berger's response to recreate Black Orchid in a new way. Gaiman had been interested by Moore's work on Swamp Thing and, like Moore, sought to explore the DC Universe using minor and obscure characters. Gaiman produced an outline for Black Orchid within a day and the next day McKean finished five paintings. They dropped them off at the hotel Kahn, Giordano, and Berger were staying at. In retrospect, Berger stated that the duo's quickness on Black Orchids concepts was the reason DC took them seriously in later years. DC commissioned Black Orchid as a three-issue limited series to debut in the 1988 holiday season. Gaiman considered it a realistic story. To set the tone for the series, he began it by killing the original Black Orchid and introducing her sisters. Then, he had the series explore the DC Universe while elaborating on Black Orchid's origin. As she had never been given a proper backstory, Gaiman decided to tie Black Orchid to Swamp Thing and Batman. He considered including characters and concepts from the 1974 Sandman series (including the Sandman, Brute, Glob, and the brothers Cain and Abel) in a scene for the first issue. The scene did not make it into later drafts because Roy Thomas was using the characters in Infinity, Inc. Gaiman used these concepts in a pitch for a new series, which became The Sandman. McKean's art, unlike other comics, combined paintings, photography, and sculptures. Some of his pages had as many as 12 panels. After Gaiman and McKean finished the first issue, Gaiman received a phone call from a worried Berger. According to Gaiman, Berger said DC was considering placing Black Orchid on hold for at least a few years because it was expected to be a financial failure: comics featuring female characters did not sell well, and while Gaiman, McKean, and the Black Orchid character were virtually unknown, the project was as big as the influential Frank Miller series The Dark Knight Returns. DC wanted Gaiman to start working on an ongoing series and McKean to paint Grant Morrison's Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth so they could build reputations, and then return to Black Orchid afterwards. The postponing ultimately did not happen because Arkham Asylum began to experience delays, which allowed McKean to finish Black Orchid. = Publication = Black Orchid began its run in December 1988 and concluded in February 1989. The series was Gaiman's first work for DC. A collected edition was published in late 1991. A hardcover deluxe edition was published on April 4, 2012, under DC's Vertigo imprint. The series received another rerelease through DC Black Label on November 12, 2019.  Plot  Carl Thorne is released from prison and goes to see billionaire criminal mastermind Lex Luthor, whom he previously had interactions with. Luthor dismisses Thorne, distrusting him due to his troublesome past. Thorne retreats to a bar, where he gripes about Luthor and blames his failures on his ex-wife Susan Linden. Meanwhile, Linden‚Äîthe superhero Black Orchid‚Äîis killed while spying on Luthor's organized crime syndicate; afterward, Luthor's employee Mr. Sterling discovers she is a plant hybrid. Elsewhere, an amnesiac young girl, Flora, awakens in a greenhouse. She wanders into a nearby house, where she meets Philip Sylvian, who recognizes her as Black Orchid. Sylvian explains that he and Linden were once romantically involved, but separated at the wishes of Linden's abusive father. Linden married Thorne, while Sylvian, Jason Woodrue, Pamela Isley, and Alec Holland worked together on advanced botanical biochemistry that led to Flora's creation; she is genetically Linden's sister. Only Sylvian remains his old self: Woodrue was incarcerated in Arkham Asylum; Isley became Poison Ivy; and Holland was allegedly murdered. Flora falls asleep afterwards, and experiences Linden's memories in her dreams. Sylvian visits Linden's room, only to be attacked by Thorne. Thorne beats Sylvian and accuses him of stealing Linden from him. Thorne proceeds to the greenhouse, where he discovers statues of Linden. Thorne begins to destroy the statues before another girl‚Äîwho insists on being called Suzy and also shares Linden's memories‚Äîappears. Thorne calls Luthor, who reluctantly comes to the scene. Luthor discovers that Sylvian died of his wounds and orders his men to throw Thorne in the nearby river. Flora saves Thorne before departing with Suzy; Luthor orders his staff to search for more like the girls. Flora and Suzy travel to Gotham City, the location of Arkham, to converse with Woodrue. The girls are told that Woodrue left the asylum and denied access. Suzy goes to Slaughter Swamp, where she is kidnapped and sold to Luthor. Flora meets Batman, who deduces that she is related to Linden and gets her into Arkham. The Mad Hatter brings Flora to Isley, who is being held there. Isley explains her involvement with the other scientists but refuses to tell Flora who she is. Frustrated, Flora leaves, fails to save Suzy, and retreats to a graveyard. Batman tells Flora that Holland is still alive and lives in the Louisiana swamplands. Black travels to Louisiana, where she meets Holland, who is now Swamp Thing. Holland explains to her that she is a reincarnation of Linden: Thorne murdered Linden, and Sylvian used her DNA and an orchid to recreate her as Black Orchid. When Linden was killed, another Black Orchid, in this case Flora, awoke. Using their connections to the Green, Holland shows Flora where Suzy is located, and Flora saves her by knocking down a tree to stop the truck she is held in. The two escape to the Amazon rainforest. However, Luthor tracks them and sends Sterling and a team to find them. While searching, Sterling's men are ambushed by Thorne as they approach the girls. Flora attempts to stop the fighting, but Sterling shoots Thorne in the chest. Thorne's death angers Flora, who sends Sterling off with a warning: if Luthor tries to interfere with her again, she will retaliate. Sterling and his men part ways, and Flora and Suzy fly back home.  Reception and legacy  Black Orchid has been well-received, with critics writing that, although one of Gaiman's early works, it has held up well. IGN summarized Black Orchid as a must-have and praised its writing and ending. They felt it was just \\"as unique and beautiful as the fictional flower that bears the title's name,\\" and wrote that while it was not as good as Gaiman's The Sandman or Moore's Swamp Thing, it was still a fascinating and unique story. The Sequart Organization agreed and stated that it provided readers an intricate and vast world, something they considered rare for a relatively short series. Black Orchid was a commercial success. Don Markstein said that while the series did not make Black Orchid a household name, it helped expose her to many readers. The series has never been out of print since its initial publication. In addition, Black Orchid helped bolster Gaiman's career and established many themes that became common in his works.  Ongoing series  After DC launched its Vertigo imprint, it started publishing a Black Orchid ongoing series in September 1993. Gaiman had no involvement in the ongoing series as he was preoccupied writing The Sandman. McKean was working in England, so he was unable to provide any art besides covers. The new series was written by Dick Foreman with art by Jill Thompson and Rebecca Guay. The series ended in June 1995 after 22 issues. At the end of the series, Flora is killed, leaving Suzy the only surviving member of their species.

In 1929 it set a new national duration record and flew successfully until the end of 1931, when several major structural and aerodynamic modifications improved its performance. A simpler, lighter version, the CW III, (also known as CW-03), was designed and built in parallel with it and became Poland's first production glider. Design and development ZASPL, the Aviation Association of students of the Lw√≥w Technical University, was the oldest aviation organization in Poland. Revived after World War I, by 1926 it had workshops in Lw√≥w which began building the glider designs of ZASPL member Wac≈Çaw Czerwi≈Ñski. The second and third of these, the CW II and CW III, were both built there during 1929. Both were high wing, wooden, open frame gliders, though only the CW II had a nacelle enclosing the pilot's cockpit. The CW II had a rectangular plan, single spar wing, with plywood covering forward of the spar and aircraft fabric covering elsewhere, which was built in three parts, a half-span wide centre-section and two outer panels with trailing edges filled with ailerons. The centre-section was mounted just above the upper longeron, or chord, of the flat girder fuselage on four outward leaning inverted-V struts. Wire bracing from the lower longerons to the outer ends of the centre- section carried lift loads. The longerons were straight, parallel and cross- braced with alternate vertical and diagonal cross-members. The lower longeron extended forward of the wing and carried a plywood nacelle with an open cockpit; the nacelle extended rearwards under the wing. Under it, a wooden landing skid was mounted on rubber shock absorbers. The empennage was conventional, with fabric-covered rectangular surfaces. Its fin extended upwards from the lower longeron to just beyond the upper one, carrying the tailplane close above; a tall, balanced rudder operated in a cut-out between balanced elevators. In 1930 ZASPL began a short production run of the CW III, an improved version of the CW II also first flown in 1929, making it the first Polish glider to go into production. A few more were amateur built and overall as many as twenty were completed. The chief difference between it and the CW II was a new, two-part, rectangular plan wing with G√¥ttingen G√¥ 365 section. This had a lower aspect ratio of 5.9, with a reduced span but increased area. There was no nacelle, with the pilot exposed on a lowered seat. It proved easier to fly than the higher-performing CW II and well suited for its intended basic training role, After successful operation between 1929 and 1931, the sole CW-II was considerably modified during the winter of 1931-2. It received a new, two part centre-section which was attached directly to the upper longeron and braced with a single strut on each side to the lower longeron. The wingtips were altered in plan from rectangular to curved, reducing the wing area by 3%, and the nacelle was better streamlined. These changes significantly improved the best glide ratio, though values given by various references differ. Operational history In 1929 Greszczyk made the first, brief flights of both the CW II and CW III, towed behind a car. In the autumn of 1929 they were taken to Bezmiechowa G√≥rna for pilot training. Over fifty flights were made, chiefly on the better-handling CW III, but on 2 November Greszczyk set a new national gliding duration record of 2:11:4.5 hours in the CW II. In the following spring they returned to Bezmiechowa with some thirteen novices, including the first two female Polish glider pilots, Danuta Sikorzaanka and Wanda Olszewskz. The CW III was used as a basic trainer, with the CW II reserved for the more experienced. From 1930 many Polish pilots learned to fly on the production CW IIIs, though these were soon joined and then supplanted by a 1931 CW II development, the simpler and cheaper CWJ. The last CW IIIs were withdrawn from service in 1938. Variants ;CW II: Built in parallel with CW III, completed 1929. Open frame glider with pilot's nacelle. ;CW IIbis: CW II revised in 1931-2 with a reduced area wing which had a new, strut braced, two part centre-section and rounded tips. Better aerodynamics and performance. ;CW III: Built in parallel with CW II, completed 1929, it was similar to the Cw II but lighter, with no pilot's nacelle, a different wing of lower aspect ratio and a different airfoil. It had lower performance than the CW II but was easier for novices to fly. Limited production from ZAPL and some amateur builds together provided about twenty airframes; it was the first Polish glider to reach production.

She was part of the Fifth Company of missionaries sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). Early life Clarissa Chapman was born and raised on a farm in Russell, Massachusetts. Her father was \\"crippled by rheumatism\\" and she remembered assisting him in farm work.Helen W. Ludlow, \\"Clarissa Chapman Armstrong\\" in Hiram Collins Haydn, ed., American Heroes on Mission Fields: Brief Missionary Biographies (American Tract Society 1894): 255-298. She trained as a teacher.

Mission work Clarissa Chapman Armstrong sailed for Hawaii on a whaling ship in 1831, with her new husband, a Presbyterian minister. They were part of the Fifth Company of missionaries sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). She was pregnant for the entire six-month journey. Her first child, Caroline, was born two months after the couple arrived, in Honolulu. The couple with Benjamin and Mary Barker Parker were assigned as missionaries to Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands from 1833 to 1834. Their first son was born there.Gary Y. Okihiro, Island World: A History of Hawai‚Äôi and the United States (University of California Press 2009): 98-104. The failure of the Marquesan mission prompted them to return to Hawaii. They lived at Wailuku on Maui from 1835 to 1840, and then moved to Honolulu. Clarissa Chapman Armstrong taught literacy and Bible study classes for women. She did not always enjoy living among the native residents of Hawaii, writing that \\"Week after week passes and we see nothing but naked, filthy, wicked heathen with souls as dark as the tabernacles which they inhabit.\\" Armstrong also made watercolor sketches of native Marquesan and Hawaiian people and places. Eric Kjellgren and Carol S. Ivory states: \\"During her time in the Marquesas, Clarissa Armstrong painted four small watercolor portraits. They show details of tattoo and personal adornment, and though somewhat naive in their rendering of the human body nevertheless capture the dignity, humanity, and individuality of their subjects.\\" Subjects of her watercolor made in Hawaii included blind preacher Bartimea Pua ªaiki, Governor Hoapili of Maui and Queen KalƒÅkua KaheiheimƒÅlie. Richard Armstrong left mission work in 1847 to take secular employment as the Minister of Public Instruction under King Kamehameha III. Clarissa Armstrong no longer taught classes, but continued to hold Bible study meetings, now with other wives of Hawaiian chiefs and government officials, including Queen Kalama. The Armstrongs lived in \\"the Stone House\\", a property of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which Clarissa kept as her residence after Richard's death in 1860. She sold the Honolulu house in 1881, and moved to San Francisco, California, to join her daughter's work at a Christian mission in that city's Chinatown. Personal life Clarissa Chapman married Richard Armstrong on September 5, 1831, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They had ten children.

Education  Rausch began his academic studies at the Ohio State University, where in 1942 he earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and entomology and in 1945 he attained the title DVM, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. His continued studies of parasitology and wildlife management led him to complete a Master of Science at Michigan State University in 1946 and a Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin in 1949.  Professional career  In 1948 Rausch took the position of senior assistant scientist at the Alaska Health Research Center (AHRC) of the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) in Anchorage in the Territory of Alaska. His job at the time was to research zoonoses in the indigenous population. As part of his research he completed extensive fieldwork in Brookskette, the North Slope region and St. Lawrence Island. He spent a lot of time with the I√±upiat, whose support assisted him with his research. From 1967 to 1974 Rausch was head of the department for infectious diseases of the AHRC in Fairbanks and also taught at the University of Alaska Fairbanks until 1975 when he began work in Canada in the department of microbiology of Western College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Saskatchewan. In 1978 he joined the University of Washington and taught until 1992 in the departments of Pathology and Comparative Medicine. Upon retirement he was named Professor Emeritus. In addition to his research work and teaching, Rausch served as a consultant for numerous national and international organizations related to matters of public health, zoonotic diseases, and polar biology. He advised organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health Organization, the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences and the government of the People's Republic of China. From 1976 to 1978 Rausch was a member of the board of the Wildlife Disease Association. The American Society of Parasitologists chose him as their vice president in 1982 and as their president in 1984, each for a term of one year.  Research  While working in Alaska in the 1940s and 1950s, Rausch performed pioneering work in the study of alveolar echinococcosis, which occurs often among the Inuit. His research in North America along with that of Hans Vogel at the Hamburg Institute for Tropical Medicine led to the discovery that fox tapeworm is the cause of the disease along with clarifying the fox tapeworm life cycle. His research on Echinococcus along with Jon J. Bernstein resulted in the discovery and description of Echinococcus vogeli, which in Latin America spread polycystic echinococcosis. Rausch also performed research related to other zoonoses such as Trichinosis, Rabies, Brucellosis and Tularemia. Rausch placed great value on international Cooperation. From the 1960s he maintained intensive contact with Soviet colleagues and repeatedly toured Siberia. To this day the name of Robert L. Rausch is inextricably linked with the study of the parasitic fauna and the zoonoses of the polar regions including Alaska and Eastern Siberia. Rauschs' scientific career lasted more than 60 years, and he authored more than 300 essays and book chapters. He and his wife Virginia R. Rausch amassed a collection of more than 60,000 predominantly parasitic worms preserved in alcohol, on glass slides, and as preparations for scanning electron microscopy. The Robert L. and Virginia R. Rausch Helminthological Collection is the foundation of the parasite collection of the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico. Another 4,000 specimens of mammals are also in this museum. Almost 800 collection items, including 133 type specimens, are located in the United States National Parasite Collection.

Early life and education  Olabisi is from Plainfield, New Jersey. She grew up wanting to be an astronaut. Her mentors have been her graduate school and postdoctoral advisors, including Profs. John Taylor, Ray Vanderby, Jr, and Jennifer L. West, as well as individuals not directly involved in her training, such as Mae Jemison. She studied aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She moved to the University of Michigan for her Masters research. She completed her doctoral work at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. She was awarded the National Science Foundation GSK-12 Award.  Research and career Olabisi was a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University, where she was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship from the National Space Biomedical Research Institute, and City of Hope National Medical Center. There, she investigated how mother-of-pearl (nacre) gets its natural strength and resilience with the hope to recreate it synthetically, by patterning hydrogels with nacre proteins. Olabisi's first faculty position was at Rutgers University; today she is an assistant professor at UC Irvine. Her research looks to make wounds heal faster using cell therapy, work that could revolutionize the recovery time of people who require plastic surgery. By combining hydrogels with proteins, cellular repair can occur faster. She is an inventor on a patent describing growing bone using microencapsulated cells releasing bone morphogenetic proteins. She found that she could entrap certain cells into hydrogels to deliver the hormone insulin, which helps to heal diabetic wounds. In 2018 she became a National Science Foundation CAREER Award grant holder, exploring chronic wounds. She is working on combining mesenchymal stem cells and insulin producing cells for dual cell therapies. She has studied the way that the body adapts to the space environment, in order to identify mechanisms that protect astronauts from the effects of microgravity, by using tissue engineering approaches to stimulate growth, regeneration, and repair. = Public engagement = Olabisi works with Mae Jemison on the grant project 100 Year Starship, an interdisciplinary initiative that is exploring the technologies necessary to achieve interstellar travel, with the goal that all such technologies would improve life on Earth (e.g., better power sources, clean energy, clothing that doesn't need washing).

Available since late 2018, the app was developed by NHS Digital and NHS England. Both Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock have stressed their support for the project. Hancock presented it as the key a radical overhaul of NHS technology. Hunt claimed it would mark 'the death-knell of the 8am scramble for GP appointments that infuriates so many patients'. It can also be used to access NHS 111, set patients' data sharing preferences, record organ donation preferences and end-of-life care preferences. All GPs in England will be required to connect to it. Development Jeremy Hunt laid down eight \\"challenges\\" for the development in September 2017: *Symptom checking and triage *Access to your medical records *GP appointment booking *Repeat prescription ordering *Changing data sharing preferences *Changing organ donation preferences *Changing end of life care choices *Promoting \\"approved apps\\" to patients The app was piloted from October 2018 and plans were to roll it out across England in December 2018. Patients are to be sent a text message from their GP practice inviting them to download the app. It was released for testing in September 2018 in Liverpool, Staffordshire, Redditch and Bromsgrove, Wyre Forest and South Worcestershire, Wolverhampton, Hastings and Rother, and Bristol, North Somerset and Gloucestershire. Initially, it would offer symptom checking and triage; appointment booking; repeat prescription ordering; access to patient records; national data opt-out; and organ donation preference. The launch of the app was accompanied by a decision that the name NHS Choices was to be abandoned, and in future the NHS site was to be called \\"the NHS website\\". In November 2018, it was reported that although it would be publicly available in the App Store and Google Play store, as well as a desktop webpage by the end of December, it would be made operational to patients \\"one STP or one CCG at a time\\", a process which was expected to take several months. From 2019, it was planned to support GP video consultations and connect to an Apple Watch or FitBit. Later development includes plans to link up with the NHS e-Referral Service to allow patients to book hospital or clinic appointments. EMIS is at present the only patient record system that is fully compatible with the app. In January 2019, it was available for downloading, but according to NHS England GP practices would need to 'review some of their system settings before they can go live'. It was intended to be fully operational by 1 July 2019. The app uses the NHS login to verify the identity of users. After the establishment in early 2019 of NHSX as a central IT department for the NHS, chief executive Matthew Gould stated that the app should not have any more features, but should be a platform allowing \\"other people innovate on top of it\\". Since 2020, facial recognition can be used to log in to the app. To take advantage of the feature, users need to submit a photo from an official document such as a passport or a driving license. The app's developers said that it could also be used for COVID-19 \\"immunity passports\\" providing documented proof of users' immunity due to a past infection. The idea has proved controversial.

That is, the algorithm encrypts any string of bits x to a new string E_k(x), while ensuring that for any pair of bit-strings x, y which share a common prefix of length p, their images E_k(x), E_k(y) also share a common prefix of length p. A mapping with this property is called prefix- preserving. In this way, Crypto-PAn is a kind of format-preserving encryption. The mathematical outline of Crypto-PAn was developed by Jinliang Fan, Jun Xu, Mostafa H. Ammar (all of Georgia Tech) and Sue B. Moon. It was inspired by the IP address anonymization done by Greg Minshall's TCPdpriv program circa 1996. Algorithm A diagram of the Crypto-PAn algorithm as a tree descent. The nodes of the tree are colored according to a pseudo-random function of the key material (not shown). The arrows show the descent corresponding to the input bit-string \\"010\\". That descent's nodes are colored \\"001\\"; the anonymized output string is thus \\"011\\". Intuitively, Crypto-PAn encrypts a bit-string of length n by descending a binary tree of depth n, one step for each bit in the string. Each of the binary tree's 2^n - 1 non-leaf nodes has been given a value of \\"0\\" or \\"1\\", according to some pseudo-random function seeded by the encryption key. At each step i of the descent, the algorithm computes the ith bit of the output by XORing the ith bit of the input with the value of the current node. The reference implementation takes a 256-bit key. The first 128 bits of the key material are used to initialize an AES-128 cipher in ECB mode. The second 128 bits of the key material are encrypted with the cipher to produce a 128-bit padding block mathit{pad}. Given a 32-bit IPv4 address x, the reference implementation performs the following operation for each bit x_i of the input: Compose a 128-bit input block I_i = x_{[0,i)} mathit{pad}_{[i,128)}. Encrypt I_i with the cipher to produce a 128-bit output block O_i. Finally, XOR the ith bit of that output block with the ith bit of x, and append the result ‚Äî x_i oplus O_{i,i} ‚Äî onto the output bitstring. Once all 32 bits of the output bitstring have been computed, the result is returned as the anonymized output E_k(x) which corresponds to the original input x. The reference implementation does not implement deanonymization; that is, it does not provide a function D_k such that D_k(E_k(x)) = x. However, decryption can be implemented almost identically to encryption, just making sure to compose each input block I_i = x_{[0,i)} mathit{pad}_{[i,128)} using the plaintext bits of x decrypted so far, rather than using the ciphertext bits: I_i eq E_k(x)_{[0,i)} mathit{pad}_{[i,128)}. The reference implementation does not implement encryption of bitstrings of lengths other than 32; for example, it does not support the anonymization of 128-bit IPv6 addresses. In practice, the 32-bit Crypto-PAn algorithm can be used in \\"ECB mode\\" itself, so that a 128-bit string x_{[0,128)} might be anonymized as E_k(x_{[0,32)}) E_k(x_{[32,64)}) E_k(x_{[64,96)}) E_k(x_{[96,128)}). This approach preserves the prefix structure of the 128-bit string, but does leak information about the lower- order chunks; for example, an anonymized IPv6 address consisting of the same 32-bit ciphertext repeated four times is likely the special address \`::\`, which thus reveals the encryption of the 32-bit plaintext \`0000:0000:0000:0000\`. In principle, the reference implementation's approach (building 128-bit input blocks I_i) can be extended up to 128 bits. Beyond 128 bits, a different approach would have to be used; but the fundamental algorithm (descending a binary tree whose nodes are marked with a pseudo- random function of the key material) remains valid. Implementations Crypto-PAn's C++ reference implementation was written in 2002 by Jinliang Fan. In 2005, David Stott of Lucent made some improvements to the C++ reference implementation, including a deanonymization routine. Stott also observed that the algorithm preserves prefix structure while destroying suffix structure; running the Crypto-PAn algorithm on a bit-reversed string will preserve any existing suffix structure while destroying prefix structure. Thus, running the algorithm first on the input string, and then again on the bit-reversed output of the first pass, destroys both prefix and suffix structure. (However, once the suffix structure has been destroyed, destroying the remaining prefix structure can be accomplished far more efficiently by simply feeding the non- reversed output to AES-128 in ECB mode. There is no particular reason to reuse Crypto-PAn in the second pass.) A Perl implementation was written in 2005 by John Kristoff. Python and Ruby implementations also exist. Versions of the Crypto-PAn algorithm are used for data anonymization in many applications, including NetSniff and CAIDA's CoralReef library.

The soundtrack for the series was released as the band's fourth studio album, Post-Apocalypto by Columbia Records. The stills from the series were used to create a graphic novel released by Fantagraphics Books in September 2020. Production In June 2012 when asked about a sequel to Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, Black stated that the band had \\"found a loophole with the internet and animated shorts. That‚Äôs the world we‚Äôre looking to dive into, and not just for money, mainly for art.\\" The band would mention later on in that year that they may make an Internet series \\"exclusive to YouTube.\\" The project was a fantasy for Black and Gass for a few years, until the Donald Trump presidential campaign inspired them to start writing a post-apocalyptic comedy in 2016. The project was assembled by Black physically drawing each frame with markers and notepads, with longtime Tenacious D bassist and producer John Spiker scanning and digitalizing the images. Michael Molina would add color later on in the progress. In December 2017, whilst on Kerrang Radio promoting Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Black stated that the title of the animated series would be called Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto. Black and Gass pitched the series to Netflix, HBO Go and Amazon Prime Video for distribution, but it was rejected. The series was ultimately released on YouTube, and revenue came mainly from the accompanying album. Release On May 6, 2018, during Tenacious D's performance at the Shaky Knees Music Festival, Black asked the audience if anyone had seen The Pick of Destiny, and that \\"part two is coming out in October.

Miranda is a Cuban-born American attorney, diplomat, journalist, and political advocate. He is a nationally recognized Catholic advocate, having served on the founding board and as first president of the Cardinal Newman Society for the Preservation of Catholic Higher Education.Testimony of Manuel A. Miranda on Religious Liberty Protection before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, June 23, 1999. During the Iraq \\"surge\\" he served as a diplomat at the Embassy of the United States, Baghdad as the first Director of the Office of Legislative Statecraft. Before then he had come to political prominence for leading U.S. Senate efforts to seat the judicial nominees of President George W. Bush as Republican Senior Nominations Counsel on the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, as Judicial Affairs Counsel to then Senate Majority Leader, Bill Frist, and for his role in the Memogate scandal. Later, as Chairman of the Third Branch Conference, a grasstops coalition of 200 national conservative leaders, Miranda became a leading conservative movement voice on judicial nominations, coming to lead conservatives in the Harriet Miers Supreme Court nomination, for which he received the American Conservative Union‚Äôs Ronald Reagan Award. In 2006, he was one of four leaders featured in a documentary, Advice & Dissent, along with United States Senators Arlen Specter and Patrick Leahy, and liberal coalition leader, Ralph Neas.https://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/advise_and_dissent Van Taylor‚Äôs Advice and Dissent, 2006.  Early life and education Miranda was born in Havana in 1959. In 1962, he immigrated with his parents to Asturias, Spain, and immigrated again in 1966 to the United States, settling in New York City. He was naturalized as an American citizen along with his father and sister in 1976. He graduated with honors from Our Lady of Mount Carmel School in Astoria, Queens. He attended Archbishop Molloy High School in Ridgewood, Queens, obtaining that school‚Äôs highest graduation award, the Pvt. Louis J. Willet Scholarship. He attended Georgetown University‚Äôs Walsh School of Foreign Service where he was the 1981 Circumnavigators Foundation Fellow, earning a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service. At Georgetown he served as the student representative on the Walsh School‚Äôs Executive Committee and as president of Alpha Phi Omega, the National Service Fraternity. (In 2016, he received from Alpha Phi Omega the Alumni Lifetime Distinguished Service Award.) While at Georgetown, in 1980 Miranda took a leave of absence to work on international refugee assistance as a Junior Operations Officer for the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (now the International Organization for Migration) at its headquarters in Geneva Switzerland, taking assignments to Madrid, Thailand and the Philippines. As the Circumnavigators Foundation Fellow, in the summer of 1981 he completed a round-the-world tour, traveling solo to 17 countries to study international responses to refugee crises. Miranda attended law school at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, where he was the first Charles Rummel Scholar. He served as chief research editor of the International & Comparative Law Review, as president of Phi Delta Phi, and he worked as research associate to the Dean and Chancellor.  Career  = Private law practice= Miranda has been admitted without interruption to the Bar of the State of New York for over 30 years, as well as to the Maryland Bar. Before public service, he had a long legal career at some of the world's most prominent international law firms, including with White & Case, Reid & Priest, and Winthrop Stimson Putnam & Roberts, where he began his career in the canyons of Wall Street. His clients included Mobil Oil Corporation, Ramada Renaissance, International Finance Corporation, InterAmerican Development Bank, Bank of America, Irving Trust, Bank of New York, Credit Lyonnais, National Grid (UK), Caterpillar, PEMEX, BHP Power, and King Ranch. Miranda‚Äôs earliest expertise, however, grew in the area of corporate governance. He has organized and structured a number of non- profit organizations, including guiding some in internecine struggles for control. The most notable representation in this area included a four- year litigation over the control of Georgetown University‚Äôs alumni association and alumni annual fund. Fought against Washington‚Äôs Williams & Connolly, at the end Miranda won and was recognized by the court as the legal representative of all Georgetown alumni. The groundbreaking case, decided on summary judgement, established the law of the District of Columbia on a number of corporate governance issues. Georgetown settled at the end wrapping up that and all related actions. At Russin & Vecchi, Miranda represented, among others, the Russian Orthodox Church of America, including advice in internecine battles over the control of parish corporate boards and a national, year-long audit of the Church‚Äôs exposure. He has assisted clients in immigration, corporate governance and crisis management, and as canon law counsel to Oscar-winning screenwriter and producer of The Exorcist, William Peter Blatty, winning for him a favorable result at the Vatican in a case against Georgetown University.  United States Senate  In 2001, Miranda joined the staff of the United States Senate, where he was assigned to the Committee on the Judiciary as Nominations Counsel in the staff of Senator Orrin Hatch. Senate Democrats had just commenced a new strategy led by Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to block the appellate court nominees of President George W. Bush using process requests to disguise ideological litmus tests. Miranda quickly became a skilled strategic defender of the Bush nominees garnering significant press and public attention, especially in the nominations of Miguel Estrada and William H. Pryor Jr.. Miranda stressed Estrada‚Äôs Honduran immigrant roots and argued the attack on Pryor showed anti-Catholic bigotry. The strategy infuriated opponents. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) called the Republican messaging ‚Äútawdry and diabolical.‚Äù A few days later the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Denver, the Most Rev. Charles J. Chaput, wrote a widely-published condemnation of Senate Democrats for engaging in ‚Äúa new kind of religious discrimination‚Äù against Catholics. By January 2003, Miranda had become Judicial Affairs Counsel to the new Senate Majority Leader, Dr. Bill Frist (R-TN). As a top leadership staffer, he now rallied 51 Republican senators and their staffs on judicial nominations and orchestrated four historic Senate floor events with Vice President Dick Cheney presiding, including a continuous 40-hour debate imaging the public‚Äôs idea of a filibuster, and an unprecedented national media campaign, marshaling nationwide grassroots and grasstop support. When he retired from the Senate in late 2006, Majority Leader Bill Frist described judicial nominations as his signature issue. No Senate Majority Leader has spent more Senate floor time debating judicial nominees, and there has never been more news and editorial coverage on that issue than in 2003. In less than one year, Republicans turned public opinion on the issue from 2 to 1 against them, to 2 to 1 for their position that every nominee deserved a vote. As a result, judicial nominations were a looming issue in the elections of 2002 and 2004 and have been in presidential and senate elections ever since. In 2004, that issue lost Democrats not only the majority but also the Senate seat of their Majority Leader, tom Daschle (D-SD). Miranda is credited for this effort and much more. To avoid the debacle experienced in 1987 with the nomination of Robert Bork, Miranda is credited with devising the ‚ÄúMiranda Plan,‚Äù ensuring rapid endorsement on the record of a Republican president‚Äôs Supreme Court nominees -- a plan that has been deployed since the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005. As the highest ranking Hispanic in the Senate Republican staff, Miranda represented Senate leadership to establish the Congressional Hispanic Conference. = Memogate= On November 14, 2003, on the last morning of the Senate‚Äôs 40-hour ‚Äútalkathon‚Äù on judicial filibusters, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial entitled ‚ÄúHe is Latino‚Äù that outlined a series of Senate staff memos illustrating the hand- in-glove relationship between Senate Democrats and left-wing interest groups in coordinating the obstruction of Bush judicial nominees. Thus commenced the Memogate scandal during which Democrats would accuse Republicans (especially Miranda) of ‚Äústealing‚Äù their \\"confidential\\" strategy memos, Republicans would demand an investigation of Democrats‚Äô possibly unlawful collusion with special interests, and the Press took sides in a two year debate over which of those two stories was the more important. In February 2004, Miranda resigned his Senate position in an unusually public manner calling for an investigation of the Democrat memos. His resignation letter was published in full by National Review. His resignation also suggested a Republicans leadership surrender that launched Miranda as a conservative hero. Miranda took an unwavering position that he was fully entitled by the Code of Ethics for Government Service to read the unprotected documents accessible on his desktop, especially if they might evidence corruption. Accusations that he and a young Hatch staffer had unlawfully hacked computers and ‚Äústolen‚Äù documents were easily proven false. Miranda never backed down, while Democrats demanded his demise he published a law review article on the law and ethics of Memogate and then brought a lawsuit to invite a federal judge to give him a declaratory judgment on Democrats‚Äô claims against him, laying out in both cases allegations of Democrat Senators' wrongdoing. Soon after leaving the Senate, Miranda became a Visiting Legal Fellow at the Heritage Foundation working for former Attorney General Ed Meese, and a regular columnist for the Wall Street Journal, coming to publish 35 columns under the banner ‚ÄúThe Next Justices.‚Äù Memogate entered the news again during the hearings for the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, in 2018. Kavanaugh was accused of perjury for claiming he was not aware of the source of the Memogate documents, when emails between him and Miranda included as an attachment at least one document that Democrat Senator Patrick Leahy described as ‚Äústolen.‚Äù Miranda issued a statement noting again that nothing had been ‚Äústolen‚Äù and that Kavanaugh was never made aware of Democrats‚Äô negligent publication of their own strategy memos on an open server.Manuel A. Miranda, Statement to CBN News,September 5,2018 = Public advocacy = As President of the Cardinal Newman Society, Miranda had many years‚Äô experience as a public advocate before working in the Senate. Over the years, he has made over 200 radio and television appearances in English and Spanish. He has a decades-old history of advocacy as a Georgetown University alumnus. After leaving Capitol Hill, Miranda organized the \\"National Coalition to End Judicial Filibusters\\" to support for the \\"nuclear option\\" or \\"constitutional option\\" that he had helped pioneer on Senator Bill Frist's leadership team.National Coalition to End Judicial Filibusters, National Coalition to End Judicial Filibusters Letter to Senators\\", April 4, 2005. Miranda was listed as the contact at the foot of the letter. The idea was a procedural motion under Senate precedent designed to have Vice President Dick Cheney, acting as President of the Senate, rule unconstitutional the Senate's six decade old application to judicial nominations of the filibuster rule, now being used in an unprecedented manner to stall Bush administration judicial nominees, including potentially against nominees to the Supreme Court. After the Gang of 14 compromise that put off the high stakes Senate confrontation, the Coalition renamed itself the \\"Third Branch Conference\\", a grasstops coalition of 200 national conservative leaders. As Chairman of the Third Branch Conference, Miranda became a leading conservative movement voice on judicial nominations, coming to lead conservatives in opposing George W. Bush‚Äôs nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. That opposition became a turning point for conservatives during the Bush presidency. For his role, Miranda received the American Conservative Union‚Äôs Ronald Reagan Award. In announcing the award, ACU President David Keene told the Conservative Political Action Conference banquet audience: \\"[Sam Alito‚Äôs] nomination would not have been made but for Manny Miranda and because of the coalition that he put together; that nomination would still be being debated, were it not for Manny Miranda.‚Äù Miranda brought the conservative audience to a sustained standing ovation when he told them: ‚ÄúWhat has driven me in the past three years, ‚Ä¶ has been that I wasn‚Äôt born in this country. And I have come to know that our Constitution and our court system is ‚Ä¶a very important reason why this country is great. And so, anything that I have been doing is simply to say thank you to this country that took in my mother and father and their two young children.\\" At the end of 2006, Miranda made front page news when he formed another wide coalition, Families First on Immigration. Its purpose was to promote a compassionate compromise to immigration legal reform based on a seven-point program called \\"Good Stewards, Good Neighbor.\\" The proposal was endorsed and summarized by Evangelical leader Tony Perkins in his 2008 book on faith and policy. = Diplomatic service in Iraq = In 2007 and 2008, Miranda served as a diplomat with the United State Embassy in Iraq as the first Director of the Office for Legislative Statecraft. He oversaw organizational change experts, lawyers and programs designed to stand up the Iraqi Council of Ministers Secretariat and the Prime Minister‚Äôs Legal Office. Miranda also worked with the Iraq and Kurdistan Bars and brokered a signed reconciliation between them that according to a 2008 USAID Report, significantly increased access to justice for the Iraqi people. In 2007, he brought Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan‚Äôs legal leaders to Washington, arranging visits for them with White House counsel, with Chief Justice John Roberts, and with key House and Senate leaders. In 2008, Miranda made news again when a memorandum to U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker was leaked. References  External links  * Dana Milbank, 2007.

In the 2013‚Äì2014 academic year, the university college started with 22 bachelor programs, 6 art courses and more than 8,500 students. On 12 December 2012, Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerp was announced as the new name for the Antwerp merger.[1] [2] The Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool is also a member of AUHA, the Association University and Colleges Antwerp. History =Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen= Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen (Artesis University College Antwerp)() was a major college in Flanders, Belgium, with campuses in Antwerp, Mechelen, Lier and Turnhout. In 2013, some departments including design sciences and engineering merged with the University of Antwerp and others, merged with the Plantijn Hogeschoolhttp://www.artesis.be/upload/docs/HetNieuwsblad_1.pdf to form the Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen. It comprised numerous departments, ranging from Linguistics and Industrial Engineering to Teacher Training and Applied Computer Science.

The college was part of the Antwerp University Association (AUHA). In 2013 this college was merged with the Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen. Academization and merger in 2013 On 5 July 2012, the Flemish Parliament approved a reform of higher education. The Bologna Declaration of 1999 proposed a reform of European education and introduced bachelor's and master's degrees. Starting with the academic year 2013‚Äì2014, Flemish higher education programs were integrated into the universities (academization). Colleges in the city and province of Antwerp were merged and a gender balance was introduced in many boards: [3] [4] * Academization eliminates the difference between academic programs at universities and academic-level programs at universities of applied sciences. The 22,000 students involved will not be physically relocated, but the universities will be responsible for the education and research policy, the quality assurance, the personnel policy and the issuing of the diplomas. The personnel involved make the transition to the university while retaining rights and obligations. The academic art courses are an exception and remain specific because of their specific character within the colleges of higher education. In order to properly supervise academization, there will be a School of Arts, a separate structure in which the universities also sit. * In October 2013, new pluralist colleges were created through mergers with greater autonomy for their operation and composition. Artesis and Plantijn were merged in Antwerp. Pascale de Groote became general director of the Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerp, she was department head of the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp from 2001 to 2013. * An important new aspect is the gender balance. In October 2013, many important bodies in higher education were composed of a maximum of 2/3 board members of the same sex. Faculties The Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen consists of four departments and two schools of arts: * Department of Health and Welfare * Department of Management and Communication * Department of Education and Training * Department of Science and Technology * Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp * Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp Campuses The university college consists of seven campuses, all located in Antwerp. The head office of the university college is located in the Lange Nieuwstraat. From September 2015, the campuses Boom, Mechelen, Paardenmarkt, Merksem and 't Zuid were brought together in Campus Spoor Noord. [5] This includes the two campuses Noorderplaats and Ellermanstraat.

His work contributed to the elevation of snapshot-style portraits to the canon of American photography. Later in his life, Albertine focused on depictions of Louisiana's flora, documenting oaks, cypresses, swamp scenes and decaying plants. A lifelong experimenter, he often enhanced his images with the split tone technique.  Life and work  Richard Albertine was born in Norwich, Connecticut in 1944. He started photographing as a teenager and won his first cash prize in a photography contest organized by The Hartford Times newspaper in Connecticut. He entered Ambrose Street Kids (1963), a portrait of three homeless children from the streets of Rochester, New York After serving in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, Albertine returned to New England. During the 1970s, his work focused on capturing his family in spontaneous moments. Experimenting with elements available at home, he sought to elevate his everyday life through composition. Lisa (1971) the portrait of his infant daughter behind a screen, and Kelly (1971) a portrait of his son under the window, are examples of this effort. In 1974 these photographs were published in The Snapshot, a volume edited by Jonathan Green and published by Aperture that sought to highlight artists working with unposed snapshot photography. At the same time, Albertine continued to invest in his formal education. He enrolled in the Rochester Institute of Technology photography program, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1970. He then went to graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under Minor White. Last Shooting Trip with Minor White (1971) is a testament to their relationship. In 1978, Albertine moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and worked for Gris Gris, a local magazine. He photographed personalities such as singer Irma Thomas and governor Edwin Edwards. In November of that year he authored an article commenting on his practice. Albertine published three photographs of his children, explaining that a deep sense of spirituality permeated his photographs, and that while his primary medium was light, his relationships informed his practice just as much. During the late 1980s Albertine turned his subject to the flora of Louisiana. His depictions of Avery Island, a nature reserve near the Louisiana coast, became a feature of his oeuvre. Exhibitions of this period focused on views of live oaks and palms endemic of the island, as well as flora in the banks of the Mississippi River and other wild areas. Albertine secured an Artist Sponsorship deal with Polaroid during the early 1990s, in which the company provided photographers with supplies in exchange for regular exhibitions to showcase their equipment. Albertine's Polaroid Portraits series returned the subject matter to snapshots of his social life. He experimented with alternative light sources and movement, frequently combining camera flash with the ‚Äòbulb‚Äô shutter setting of his Polaroid 110A. The result is an array of dynamic compositions that are full of energy and movement. These photographs were exhibited in a one-man show in Baton Rouge, LA.Anne Price. \\"Capital Camera Exhibiting Albertine Works\\". The Advocate, March 8, 1998. Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

It was established in 1966 and was amalgamated with the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps into the Commissary Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces in 1973. History The Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces was established on 1 October 1966 (TLA 1966:39) through a merger of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps, the Swedish Naval Supply Service (Marinintendenturk√•ren) and the Swedish Air Force's quartermaster officers. The chief of the corps exercised, under the command of the Supreme Commander, the supervision and oversight of the corps. He was as chief of the Swedish Army Quartermaster Corps and the Swedish Naval Supply Service subordinate to the Chief of the Army and the Chief of the Navy. In addition, according to the Supreme Commander's order, he was responsible for the military positions of the Swedish Air Force's quartermaster officers. The chief of the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces was under the command of the Supreme Commander. The chief was, unlike other administrative corps chiefs (except the chief of the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps) full time involved with corps' tasks. The Swedish Army Quartermaster School (Intendenturf√∂rvaltningsskolan, IntS) was subordinated to the chief of the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces. The chief would primarily represent the interests of the corps staff in different ways. The most demanding tasks were to conduct staff development, and evaluating staff development and promotion opportunities. In this regard, the chief was usually assisted by a head of a government agency where staff were placed for service. In order to be able to actively work in the environment where the staff were employed, the chief himself needed significant experience of this.

She is a professor at the University of California, Davis. Sumner's research includes evaluating microbial communities in Antarctic lakes, exploration of Mars via the Curiosity rover, and characterization of microbial communities in the lab and from ancient geologic samples. She is an investigator on the NASA Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and was Chair of the UC Davis Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences from 2014-2016. She is Fellow of the Geological Society of America.  Early life and education  Sumner was born near Seattle, Washington, and spent part of her childhood on the Yakama Indian Reservation in the Pacific Northwest. From there, she earned a B.S. with Honors in geology from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for her Ph.D. which she completed in 1995. Sumner then returned Caltech for postdoctoral research, supported by an O.K. Earl Postdoctoral Fellowship.  Career  *Ancient Microbial Communities - Sumner's research includes understanding microbial evolution and ecology, and Earth history, through understanding microbial signatures in the rock record. Her publications feature new developments in how to interpret ancient biological responses to environmental factors, tracing oxygenation and the impact on carbonate microbial biological signatures. *Antarctic Lakes Sumner's research utilizes Antarctic lakes as a model system for understanding microbial processes, early oxygenic photosynthesis, and life on other planets. This work includes the discovery of pinnacles of microbial growth under ice-covered lakes and describes multiple microbial communities involved in the development of these features. Similar features in another Antarctic lake appear to record changes in the lake environment, including sea level, through time. *Exploration of Mars and its Environments Professor Sumner's research with the Mars Science Laboratory has generated over three dozen collaborative publications. Sumner's research has established that parts of ancient Mars could have hosted life as we know it on Earth, and contributed to the discovery of organic molecules on Mars. Sumner is a MSL ‚Äúlong term planner‚Äù, one of several lead geoscientists amongst more than five hundred scientists not directly employed by NASA on this project. Sumner was involved in the creation of a geological map of Gale crater, and selecting the landing site of Curiosity. Sumner was partially responsible for the assignment of daily operations to fit the long-term missions goals. and also involved in future planning for additional Mars exploration, including a mission in 2020.  Awards and honors  Sumner was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of America in 2014. Also in 2014, she was selected to deliver the honorary Carl Sagan Lecture at the American Geophysical Union. In 2016, Sumner was awarded the Career Award for Outstanding Contributions in Geosciences, Geobiology and Microbiology from the Geological Society of America. Sumner also received the distinguished career award from the University of California, Davis 2016: for extensive research in microbiology, geochemistry, and research in the exploration of mars over her career.  Equality and sexual harassment in science  Sumner is the author of a widely used anti-harassment statement that she made public so that other universities and institutes could use it as a model. A leader in helping institutions develop anti-harassment plans, Sumner presented to a workshop at the 2016 American Geophysical Union on ‚ÄúAddressing harassment and improving workplace climate.‚Äù She was also an invited presenter for Association of Polar Early Career Scientists webinar on sexual harassment during fieldwork. Sumner is presently Chair of Advisory Board for The Feminist Research Institute at the UC, Davis In June 2020 she became the leader of the Anti-Racism Action Committee in her department (Earth and Planetary Science) at UC Davis.

According to his Medal of Honor citation, despite having been severely wounded during the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Virginia on April 6, 1865 and again at Farmville on April 7, he refused hospitalization, choosing instead to remain with his regiment in order to perform the duties of the 1st Maine's regimental adjutant who had recently fallen in combat. Those duties included services rendered by Tobie at Appomattox. Formative years Born on March 19, 1838 in Lewiston, Maine, Edward Parsons Tobie, Jr. was a son of abolitionist Edward Parsons Tobie, Sr. (1800‚Äì1875) and his first wife, Caroline (Frye) Tobie (1804‚Äì1838). His father, a wool carder by trade who ultimately became the town clerk of Lewiston, holding that job, with the exception of one year from 1839 until 1875. A deacon with Lewiston's Free Baptist Church, the elder Tobie also helped fugitive slaves escape to Canada. The other siblings in the Tobie household were: Sarah, Mary, Joseph, and Laroy/Leroy (born, respectively, in 1829, 1832, 1838, and 1843). Civil War Following his enrollment in Maine for Civil War military service, Edward P. Tobie, Jr. officially mustered in for duty as a sergeant with Company G of the 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry. He then participated with his regiment in a number of the Union Army's most important engagements of the war, including 1862's First Battle of Winchester (May 25) and battles of Cedar Mountain (August 9), Second Bull Run (August 28‚Äì30), South Mountain (September 14), Antietam (September 17), and Fredericksburg (December 11‚Äì15); 1863's Stoneman's Raid, Battle of Brandy Station (June 9), during which he was taken prisoner after being wounded, and the battles of Gettysburg (July 1‚Äì3), and Mine Run (November 7 to December 2); and 1864's battles of Todd's Tavern (May 7), Haw's Shop (May 28), Old Church (May 30), Cold Harbor (May 31 to June 12), Trevilian Station (June 11‚Äì12), St. Mary's Church (June 24), Deep Bottom I/Gravel Hill (July 27‚Äì29), Ream's Station II (August 25), and Boydton Plank Road (October 27‚Äì28). Tobie was then appointed as sergeant-major on December 12, 1864. During the spring of 1865, Tobie then performed the act of valor for which he would ultimately be awarded the U.S. Medal of Honor. Despite having been severely wounded in action during the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Virginia on April 6, 1865 and again at Farmville on April 7, he refused hospitalization, choosing instead to remain with his regiment in order to perform the duties of the 1st Maine's regimental adjutant who had recently fallen in combat. Those duties included services rendered by Tobie at Appomattox. As told in Beyer's Deeds of Valor: > Lieutenant T. Little, adjutant of the First Maine Cavalry, was wounded in > the first charge of General Smith's Third Brigade on the 6th, and shortly > after his successor, Lieutenant J. W. Poor, met a like fate, whereupon > Colonel Cilly detailed Sergeant Tobie to assume the duties of adjutant. Just > as the regiment started on the final charge that day which resulted so > disastrously for the enemy a bullet pierced Tobie's foot and threw him to > the ground. With great difficulty he hobbled to the rear, but upon > recovering his horse, which had been caught by the colonel's orderly, he > mounted it and started for the field hospital, where he had his wound > bandaged.

The regiment was on the march early next day, the > plucky sergeant with it, and though his foot pained him greatly he did not > hesitate and stay behind when the charge into the village of Farmville was > made. He rode at the front of the second battalion with Major Hall, and > dashing through the village put to rout a superior force of the enemy. In > this charge Sergeant Tobie was again wounded, the bullet passing through his > leg, killing his horse; but upon finding that the wound was not serious, he > had it bandaged and a second time rejoined his regiment, having in the > meantime procured another horse. That night found him with his regiment on > its march to Appomattox, where for a third time he was, in a wounded > condition, engaged with the enemy. In addition to his Medal of Honor award, Tobie's valor was also recognized via a good conduct mention in the Appomattox battle report filed by his superior officer. On May 8, 1865, Tobie was then commissioned as a second lieutenant with Company E of the 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry. With the war over and Reconstruction beginning, he returned home with his regiment in early August 1865. Post-war life Following his honorable discharge from the military, Tobie returned home to New England. On September 14, 1870, he and his wife, Adeline (Phipps) Tobie (1843-1891), welcomed the birth of son, Edward (1870‚Äì1952). They made their home initially in Providence, Rhode Island, where he was employed as the assistant to the editor of the Providence Journal. Sometime during the 1870s, Tobie was appointed as the historian of his former Civil War regiment, which had been reconstituted as the First Maine Cavalry Association, and charged with researching and writing that regiment's history. The result was the 1887 publication of History of the First Maine Cavalry 1861-1865. 1st Maine Volunteer Cavalry's monument, Gettysburg National Battlefield, 1898. In 1889, he wrote a poem and history sketch about the 1st Maine Cavalry to celebrate the placement of a monument to his former Civil War regiment on at the Gettysburg National Battlefield. He then read both at that monument's dedication ceremony on October 3, 1889. The words of Tobie's poem heard that day were: > This sculptured soldier here, > In readiness to mount and ride > Where duty‚Äôs call or country‚Äôs need > Shall point the way, whate‚Äôer betide, > With faith unbounded in his steed, > And knowing naught of fear, > With spirit that will face > Privations such as few endure > And danger dire to life and limb, > Face death, for love of country pure, > And calmly meet his summons grim, > Face aught except disgrace;‚Äî > This sculptured soldier here > Is type of thousands, good and true, > Who, six and twenty years ago, > Stood on this field, brave boys in blue, > Stood firm against th‚Äô invading foe‚Äî > And some lie buried near; > Not only here they stood, > But on a hundred fields of strife > They stood ‚Äòmid storm of shot and shell > And offered life for nation‚Äôs life; > They did their duty grandly well,‚Äî > They did all soldier could. > This sculptured soldier here > Embodies all the service grand, > The days of suffering and pain, > The hardships met on every hand, > By nigh three thousand men from Maine, > The State which we revere,‚Äî > And all the weary hours > Of picket duty day and night, > The campaigns ‚Äòneath a southern sun, > The march, the skirmish and the fight, > The battles fought, the victories won, > By these brave boys of ours, > And all the throb and ache > Of wounds received from fellow-men > And illness nothing could appease, > The dreary life in prison pen, > The death by battle and disease,‚Äî > All this for country‚Äôs sake. > This sculptured soldier here > Will tell their story through all time; > And more than that, will teach to all > Who look on him, that ‚Äòtis sublime > To promptly answer duty‚Äôs call; > And duty make so clear, > That in the coming years > The spirit of these gallant men > Throughout the land will e‚Äôer abide, > And should our country call again, > As many more will mount and ride > With neither doubts nor fears. In 1881, he was assigned by the editor of the Providence Journal to oversee that newspaper's Pawtucket, Rhode Island office, a position he continued to hold for nearly two more decades. Death and interment Preceded in death by his wife, Addie, in Rhode Island on April 25, 1891, and ailing with Bright's Disease, Edward P. Tobie, Jr. died shortly after the turn of the century, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island on January 21, 1900, and was then laid to rest beside his wife at the Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.

History The Scottish Gaelic language has been in decline since the fourteenth century, when its speakers were a majority of Scotland's population, due to the higher prestige of Scots, then later of English. The East Sutherland dialect was spoken in coastal villages by fisherfolk descended from Gaelic speakers who had been evicted from the fertile interior valleys of Sutherland during the Highland Clearances of the early nineteenth century. Because of their occupational, social, and geographical isolation, the fisherfolk retained the use of the Gaelic language about half a century longer than surrounding communities, in the process becoming isolated from other dialects of Gaelic. East Sutherland speakers could only understand other dialects of Gaelic with difficulty, if at all. By the turn of the twentieth century, Gaelic was still the community language; there were even a few monolingual speakers. Although the decline of the fishing industry following World War II had impacted the local dialect's viability, when Nancy Dorian started studying the dialect in 1963, there were still more than 200 speakers in Brora, Golspie and Embo, including 105 in Embo, where they were more than a third of the population. Dorian found that the Gaelic language was able to adapt to modern life even while becoming moribund, because speakers were able to borrow words from English and apply them to any discussion, even for highly technical topics. She was able to classify speakers as \\"older fluent speakers\\", \\"younger fluent speakers\\", and \\"semi-speakers\\", describing the linguistic differences between each speaker type. The socioeconomically homogeneous community was characterized by a high degree of variation between speakers, even those classified in the same speaker type. Certain types of syntactic distinctions, such as grammatical gender, case markings, and the two passive constructions, were lost gradually, rather than erased wholesale, as some theoreticians had predicted. By the 1991 census, the number of speakers had declined to less than a twentieth of a century earlier. One of two remaining native speakers, Wilma Ross of Embo, died in 2017; the terminal speaker is her sister Jessie. Study The East Sutherland dialect became well known in the field of language death based on the research by Nancy Dorian, beginning in 1963. Dorian's 1981 book Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect, was described by Wolfgang U. Dressler as \\"the first major monograph\\" on language death.

The book is set in an alternate present in which Islamic countries form a prosperous, democratic and progressive First World, while underdeveloped Christian countries suffer from religious fanaticism.Through Darkest Europe. MacMillan Publishers. Plot In this alternate world, the dominating Muslim cultures of North Africa and the Middle East are \\"liberal, tolerant, and above all rich\\" while Europe is a hot spot of Christian fundamentalism, with assassinations, hijackings, and bombings committed by extremist groups including the Aquinists. Senior Investigator Khalid al-Zarzisi is sent to Rome with his partner Investigator Dawud ibn Musa with the mission of protecting the Grand Duke (monarch of all Italy), the impoverished Pope, and preventing European instability from affecting the First World. The alternate history's point of departure, as detailed in the first chapter, occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries due to different developments in Christian theology and Islamic theology. Thomas Aquinas, who in the real world sought to reconcile religion and reason, taught that Christianity and reason were incompatible, and that religious faith should override reason. Conversely, Al-Ghazali, who in the real world argued that Islamic faith was superior to philosophy and science, thought that the two were compatible. The developed First World has advanced science, including Turkish moon landings. Classical Arabic is used as a world language spoken by the educated and used in standard signs. Muslim culture, language, and style spread around the world with the spread of modernity.

Early life and education Thomas Wu is the fourth of six children born to entrepreneur and his wife Wu Kuei-lan. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Fu Jen Catholic University in 1972, and completed a master's in business administration from the Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles in 1975. In 1990, Wu was kidnapped by Hu Gwan-bao. Wu was freed on 18 December 1990 upon payment of a NT$100 million ransom. Hu was arrested days later by Hou You-yi. Career Wu founded Taishin International Bank via merger in 1992, divesting from his father's textiles company to do so. In February 2002, Wu's Taishin Financial Holdings began business operations. Months after its establishment, Taishin Financial announced a planned merger with Taiwan Securities Company and . Later that year, Taishin Financial broke ground on a new office building, the Taishin Tower. Wu also explored merging with , held by his brother Eugene. Plans for the merger were called off after days of consideration. In 2003, Taishin Bank launched the Visa Infinite card throughout Asia. The next year, Wu considered a merger with . In March 2004, Wu stated that Taishin Financial had partnered with Test Rite International to securitize Time Plaza, and that the site was the first property-backed securitization project targeting pre-sold housing units. In August 2004, Thomas Wu terminated several Taishin Financial board members close to his brother Eric. Later that month, the board of directors of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation elected Thomas to serve as company chairman. Their mother made it known that she preferred Eric take the position, and asked Thomas to step down. Eric and his mother contested Thomas's election, because members of the board were to be reselected prior to the vote that installed Thomas as chairman. As the business chairmanship dispute continued, Thomas and Eric were suspected of insider trading and investigated by the Financial Supervisory Commission. In November 2004, the conflict was resolved. Thomas yielded the chairmanship of Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation to Eric, and was named to the same position at Taishin Financial Holdings. In turn, Eric ceded his proxy votes on the Taishin Financial board to Thomas, and secured Taishin Investment Trust Company's independence from Taishin Financial. The FSC ruled in December 2004 that there were no financial gains, and therefore no insider trading, but that Taiwan Securities Company had not sought final approval to trade shares in Shinkong Synthetic Fibers. As a result, Taiwan Securities Company was fined NT$2.5 million. With the leadership dispute resolved, Taishin Financial share price rose to NT$29.40 in early December 2004. Thomas Wu expressed support for the Financial Supervisory Commission as the agency announced criteria for the merger of financial holding companies in December 2004. The next year, Wu began considering plans for merger and acquisition. Wu stated in March 2005 that Bank SinoPac had elected to considered a merger with the International Bank of Taipei instead of Taishin Financial. SinoPac chairman Richard Hong said, \\"The talks with Taishin did not collapse,\\" and that a final decision would be made in May. Taishin charged two SinoPac employees with libel in May, for distributing an email to SinoPac shareholders including incorrect information regarding Taishin. After SinoPac apologized for the miscommunication, the charges were withdrawn. After the merger with SinoPac fell through, Taishin Financial bid NT$36.6 billion for a controlling stake in Chang Hwa Commercial Bank. In December 2005, Taishin Financial sought to acquire a larger share of Chang Hwa. By October 2006, the financial institutions were proposing a share swap. Taishin Financial and Aegon N.V. formed a joint venture in insurance in June 2007. The deal also included a 2.5% stake of Chang Hwa changing hands. Wu announced in July that the merger between Chang Hwa and Taishin Financial would be complete by the end of the year. However, the Executive Yuan stalled the merger, necessitating the sale of Taishin Securities Company to the Koos Group. A Taishin Financial shareholders' meeting in June 2013 saw the passage of a resolution permitting Wu to pursue legal action to merge Taishin International Bank and Chang Hwa Bank. Days later, Chang Hwa executives also formally backed the merger. Personal Wu is married to . Wu Shu-jen disclosed in February 2009 that she had received a sum of money from Thomas Wu. Thomas Wu was questioned by the Supreme Prosecutors Office a year later, as part of ongoing investigation into corruption charges against Chen Shui-bian, Wu Shu-jen's husband.

It was introduced by William A. Smith, a professor in the Division of Ethnic Studies and Department of Education, Culture, and Society at the University of Utah. The framework offers a lens to better understand racial undertones of a campus environment and educational experiences for people of color, Smith's research originated on Black faculty, both men and women, and then Black college students, prior to a more focused examination on African American men. Since this earlier period of research, racial battle fatigue scholarship has been used to include other racially minoritized groups. The phenomenon builds on existing research connecting African Americans and other people of color with oppression and discrimination experienced at historically White institutions. Smith incorporates literature on combat trauma and combat stress syndrome to help understand the effects of managing hostile environments and persistent extreme stress.  Research on African American male students  For a person of color, being on the receiving end of racial slights can manifest in an unabating balance of time and energy in determining if they are motivated by a racist intent and if they are worthy of responding to. Smith stated that many African American boys and adults \\"will perceive their environment as extremely stressful, exhausting, and diminishing to their senses of control, comfort, and meaning while eliciting feelings of loss, ambiguity, strain, frustration, and injustice\\" because of chronic racial microaggressions and overt racism (also called, racial macroaggressions). The accumulation of emotional and physiological symptoms resulting from subtle and overt forms of racial verbal and nonverbal microaggressions at the societal, interpersonal, and institutional level can lead to traumatic psychological and physiological stress symptoms.  Psychological and physiological symptoms of racial battle fatigue  Psychological symptoms can include but are not limited to: depression, chronic anxiety, anger, frustration, shock, disturbed sleep, disappointment, resentment, emotional or social withdrawal, intrusive thoughts or images, avoidance, helplessness, and fear. Acceptance of racist attributions, or internalized racism, may also be a psychosocial response. Physiological symptoms such as high blood pressure, headaches, increased breathing and heart rate in anticipation of racial conflict, upset stomach, ulcers, fatigue, exhaustion, and muscle tension around the neck, shoulders, and head may be present due to the persistent nature of the stress experienced. Clark and colleagues proposed that these stress responses are also related to cardiovascular reactivity and higher rates of hypertension among African Americans. Moreover, prolonged activation of sympathetic responses may result in higher resting systolic blood pressure and increases in mean arterial blood pressure. It has been well-documented that Black male college students experience greater dropout and lower grades. When compared with their Black female counterparts, Black males were also more likely to drop out of high school and college. Researchers asserted that the distress and academic attrition that may be present with Black males at historically White universities should not be attributed to their lack of academic preparedness, rather the aftermath of subtle and cumulative racial discrimination that occurs in those places. One of Smith's earliest studies on racial battle fatigue gathered 36 African American college students enrolled in historically white university campuses into focus groups with guided discussions. During the time of the study, the students had been enrolled at: Harvard University; University of California, Berkeley; University of Michigan, University of Michigan Law School; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; and Michigan State University. The students reported psychological responses aligned with racial battle fatigue and all perceived the college environment to be more hostile towards African American males than other groups. Consistent patterns described by the students involved experiences of hypersurvellience and control from white people and anti-Black stereotyping. Another published article on the findings from the study expressed stereotyping and scrutinizing from campus police officers. One student recounted an incident while at UC Berkeley: > \\"[At] Underhill [residence hall], all last semester, almost every night, > there‚Äôs Whites, there‚Äôs Asians in Underhill playing Frisbee, or playing > football, or what have you at one o‚Äôclock in the morning. [They are] out > there yelling, having a good time, and never [having] any problems. So, me > and my friends [all Black males] are out there about to play some football, > and it‚Äôs like 11 o‚Äôclock. All of a sudden, UCBP [UC-Berkeley Police] sweeps > up. First, it‚Äôs one car, and they get out the car and it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWe got > some complaints. You guys need to leave.‚Äô Mind you, there‚Äôs about maybe 10 > of us and we‚Äôre out there still just tossing the football around. Then, > after [the UCBP officer] is there for maybe about two minutes, all of a > sudden from this entrance over here, we have two other [UCBP squad] cars > swooping in on Underhill lot.\\" Despite stating to the police rationally that they were using campus property, the student and his friends were asked to leave or be arrested. The messages perceived by the students is that they as [Black males] were unwanted, unvalued, and not as respected compared to his other non-Black college peers. This experience may also reflects community policing tactics employed by the police against Black males as a larger systemic issue.  Research on Latino/a/x students  A 2014 research study assessed if Latino/a/x students experience similar psychological and physiological stress responses on college campuses following racialized incidents that Smith described for African American males. They found that the common experiences of racial microaggressions were interpersonal, non-verbal, institutional, racial jokes and remarks, low teacher expectations, and false assumptions based on stereotypes. Moreover, they upheld that Latino/a/x experience more psychological stress because of racial microaggressions. As such, the stress responses highlighted by racial battle fatigue is quantitively linked to Latina/o/x students.  Limitations  The African American male experiences described in the earlier studies conducted cannot be generalized to other people of color, females, or African American females. The study assessing Latina/o students with racial battle fatigue had a small sample size and did not differentiate between gender.Smith and his research teams have addressed this criticism in more recent studies. For instance, in his study, \\"The Impact of Racial Microaggressions Across Educational Attainment for African Americans (Smith, W.A., Franklin, J.D., & Hung, M, 2020), there was an effective sample size over 3,000 participants. Additionally, many other researchers using the racial battle fatigue framework have similar or greater sample sizes in their study.

These ideographs function as mnemonic devices to record proverbs, fables, games, riddles and animals, and to transmit knowledge.  History  = Origins = According to ethnologist Gerhard Kubik, this tradition must be ancient and certainly pre- colonial, as observers independently collected the same ideographs among peoples separated for generations. Additionally, early petroglyphs from the Upper Zambezi area in Angola and Citundu-Hulu in the Mo√ß√¢medes Desert exhibit structural similarities with lusona ideographs. For example, a lusona known as , and a lusona showing interlaced loops known as , both appear in the rock arts of the Upper Zambezi recorded by Jos√© Redinha. Those petroglyphs date from a period between the 6th century BC and the 1st-century BC. It's possible that those petroglyphs and Sona ideographs are related, however there is no direct evidence that this is the case, other than the similarities and the geographic location. = Post-16th century = One of the most basic lusona, katuva vufwati, sometimes appears on objects of trade carried by people in the Kingdoms of Matamba and Ndongo, that we can sometimes see depicted by the Italian missionary Antonio Cavazzi de Montecuccolo in watercolor drawings from his book about those kingdoms. Later, after the 20th century, various ethnographers and anthropologists would write on Sona ideographs, one of the first being Hermann Baumann in 1935 with his book \\"Lunda\\".  Usage  Sona ideographs are sometimes used as murals, and most of the time executed in the sand. To make them, drawing experts ‚Äî after cleaning and smoothing the ground ‚Äî would impress equidistant dots and draw a continuous line between them. The dots can represent trees, persons or animals, while the lines can represent paths, rivers, fences, walls, contours of a body, etc.  Mathematical properties  The mathematical ideas exhibited by those ideographs are transformational geometry, abstract algebra and linear algebra. 80% are symmetric and 60% are mono-linear. They are an example of the use of a coordinate system and geometric algorithms. = Geometric algorithms = Sona drawings can be classified by the algorithms used for their construction. Paulus Gerdes identified six algorithms, most commonly the \\"plaited-mat\\" algorithm, which seems to have been inspired by mat weaving. = Chaining rules and theorems = Various studies suggest that the drawing experts knew specific rules of \\"chaining\\" and \\"elimination\\" relating to the systematic construction of monolinear figures. Studies suggest that the \\"drawing experts\\" who invented these rules knew why they were valid, and could prove in one way or another the validity of the theorems that these rules express. It is difficult to find accounts of theorems developed by the drawing experts to generalize specific patterns relating to dimension and monolinearity/polylinearity, as this tradition was secret and in extinction when it started to be recorded. However, the drawing experts possibly knew that rectangles with relatively prime dimensions give one-line drawings. This idea is supported by the fact that of the 30 smallest relatively prime rectangular shapes, 75% appears among the documented drawings. It is further possible that they knew that if a square of a dot is added to a one-line lusona, the lusona would still be mono-linear. It seems clear that they had experimentally discovered this fact for 2 X 2 squares.

Her music spans classical, electronic, minimalist, jazz, impressionist, and metal genres. In many of her compositions, Moran utilizes electronic musical techniques in combination with the John Cage-pioneered technique of the prepared piano. Moran signed with Warp Records in September 2018. Early life and education Moran grew up in Port Washington, New York and started taking piano lessons when she was six years old. She also learned how to play string and electric bass, clarinet, oboe, and guitar. At age fifteen, she began experimenting with electronic music software. Moran later earned her degree in Performing Arts Technology from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, where she studied piano performance, sound engineering, and composition. Moran pursued her MFA at the University of California, Irvine, where she explored the genres of minimalism and post-minimalism. While there, she composed experimental piano pieces primarily to accompany dance performances. Career When Moran returned to New York after her graduate program, she played bass guitar for no-wave punk band Cellular Chaos. She also played keyboard and synth in experimental rock ensemble Voice Coils. Moran self-released her first album, Optimist, in 2016 and re-released on vinyl and CD on Primal Architecture Records and Obsolete Units respectively. Moran released her next album, Bloodroot, on Telegraph Harp in 2017. In it, she combines her classical piano training with her electronic production techniques and her passion for John Cage-style prepared piano. The album has been described as a melding of \\"electroacoustic deconstruction and classical, harmonious minimalism\\". Bloodroot was mastered by Colin Marston of metal bands Krallice and Gorguts. The New York Times named Bloodroot on its list of \\"The 25 Best Classical Music Recordings of 2017\\". Rolling Stone named it one of its 20 best avant albums of 2017. Bandcamp named it among its top 100 albums of 2017. Uproxx included it on its list of the best electronic and experimental records of 2017. Moran signed with Warp Records in September 2018 to release her album Ultraviolet, which has been recognized by the New York Times, Rolling Stone, and Vice, among others. Ultraviolet is more rooted in improvisation than Moran's other meticulously- composed works. Until Ultraviolet, which was released in November 2018, Moran had been the sole engineer and producer of her records. In an interview, Moran noted that because the production world is male-dominated, she preferred establishing herself as an independent artist before bringing others in who may get credit for her work. Moran has referred to herself as \\"a very outspoken feminist\\" and believes \\"the act of a woman making music is a kind of political act in itself since we live in a world where women are expected to be quiet and are often silenced for speaking out.\\" She believes performance and composition are ways for women to reclaim space and assert their existence. In addition to her solo work, Moran has composed for Margaret Leng Tan, a classical music artist known for her work as a professional toy pianist and a John Cage collaborator. Moran is also a keyboardist in Oneohtrix Point Never's touring ensemble for his 2018 album Age Of. Style Example of a prepared piano. Moran utilizes the prepared-piano format in her compositions, which involves altering a piano by placing objects on or between its strings. The style was pioneered by musicians John Cage and Henry Cowell. Moran's style is also compared to Erik Satie. Moran creates unique timbres through this method, often placing items like screws within the piano and playing the strings with her fingers or an EBow.

All 105 of Alabama's state representatives were up for reelection. In Alabama, members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate serve four year terms, running in years corresponding with presidential midterm elections. The Republican Party picked up five seats in the chamber, despite national success for the Democratic Party throughout the United States. Several factors contributed to this. For one, four of the gains made by Republicans were in rural districts with longtime incumbents who chose to retire in 2018 rather than run for reelection. A lack of strong incumbents allowed the Republicans, whose support among rural whites has greatly strengthened in Alabama since the 1990s, to pick up most of these seats with relative ease. Additionally, the Alabama Democratic Party was heavily disorganized and internally divided, leaving many candidates in competitive districts to run without a meaningful party apparatus behind them. President Donald Trump's popularity in the state (which he won by 28 points in 2016) likely also contributed to increased enthusiasm among Republicans. While Democrats did increase their share of the popular vote from 2014, it was more a function of several Democratic-seats being left uncontested than an increase in statewide support. The results were a major disappointment for Democrats, who less than a year earlier had won a fiercely fought U.S. Senate race in Alabama. As a result of these defeats the state party began a period of reform, with State Representative Christopher J. England replacing Nancy Worley as chair of the party. The results also highlighted the dramatic racial divide among Alabama's political parties‚Äîafter this election, only one Democratic representative (Neil Rafferty) in the chamber was white, while no Republican representatives were black. Election results Before the election, Republicans already held 72-33 supermajority over the Democrats.

Although the coalition, consisting of the Christian Social Party and the Greater German People's Party, was unambiguously right of center, the government itself was supposed to be nonpartisan ‚Äì a so-called \\"cabinet of civil servants\\" (\\"\\") loyal to the country rather than to any particular faction. Eight of its eleven members, including the chancellor himself, were political independents and career administrators in the employ of the Republic. The government's main opponent was the Social Democratic Party. The main challenges facing the first Schober government were Austria's lack of money, rampant inflation, and dependence on imports the country became increasingly unable to afford. The government was in desperate need of credit, but loans would not be forthcoming until Austria assuaged fears among the Allies of World War I that it might attempt to defy the Treaty of Saint- Germain. The Treaty forbade Austria to pursue accession into Weimar Germany, an idea that was popular in Austria at the time and that was in fact one of the People's Party defining platform planks. When Schober managed to open lines of credit through confirming Austria's commitment to independence in the Treaty of Lana, the People's Party forced his resignation.  Background  = Economy = In the final decades of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the region that would later become the Republic of Austria had been dependent on Bohemian industry and on Bohemian and Hungarian agriculture for its standard of living. The Austria of 1921 was structurally weak and forced to import large amounts of food and coal from Czechoslovakia. The poor tax base and brutal trade imbalance prompted the Austrian government to print too much money. By 1921, the country had exhausted its reserves and inflation was galloping. Austria relied on foreign loans to keep buying Czechoslovak food and coal and to generally just keep running; it would require even more foreign loans, drastically larger ones, to reform its currency and to actually restructure. These loans would not be forthcoming, however, as long as the Allies of World War I could not be thoroughly certain that Austria would obey the provisions of the Treaty of Saint-Germain. There were still fears among the Allies that Austria might try to join the German Reich in defiance of the treaty; these fears had to be laid to rest. The Allies paid close attention to Austria's relationship with Czechoslovakia. Prague too was worried about a possible Austrian attempt to join Germany; Prague was also worried about a possible Austrian attempt to restore the Habsburgs to power. In March 1921, Charles I of Austria unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim the Hungarian throne. Although Hungary swiftly and roundly rebuffed the would-be king, the incident put additional strain on Austro-Czechoslovak relations. A resolution of the tensions would go a long way towards reassuring Austria's potential creditors. = Political climate = Ignaz Seipel, leader of the plurality party, would have been an obvious candidate for chancellor but declined to step up. The fourteen parties in Austria's Constituent Assembly had radically different visions regarding the constitutional, territorial, and economic future of their demoralized, impoverished rump state. The Social Democratic Party controlled a plurality but not a majority of the seats. It eventually formed a grand coalition with the Christian Social Party, the largest party on the right and the second-largest party overall. The grand coalition was a pragmatic choice but not an ideologically undemanding one. The government found itself blocked at every turn by party leaders' unwillingness to compromise. No other alliance would have commanded the support of a stable parliamentary majority. Austrians began to warm to the idea of a \\"cabinet of civil servants\\" (\\"\\"), a government of senior career bureaucrats who would be loyal to the country and not to any particular ideological camp. The Habsburg Empire had consciously cultivated an ethos of partisan neutrality in its civil servants. A pool of highly educated middle-aged administrators who counted sober professionalism as an important aspect of their self-image stood ready to be tapped. The grand coalition had fallen apart by June 1920, but the right-of-center alliance succeeding it was not much more efficient. The idea of a cabinet of independents was still popular, and Johannes Schober was an obvious choice for the person to lead it. The Vienna Chief of Police enjoyed wide name recognition and was respected across party divides for his competence and effectiveness. He also enjoyed a reputation for personal integrity, an important point in a country sick of corruption and nepotism. He was known to be close to the pan-German cause but still considered nonpartisan. Another obvious candidate for chancellor was Ignaz Seipel, the leader of the Christian Socials, who had displaced the Social Democrats as the plurality party in the elections of 1920. Seipel, however, was reluctant to assume the chancellorship because of the difficult decisions and general hardship he knew still lay ahead; he wanted someone else to do the dirty work. The Republic of German-Austria had been proclaimed with the understanding that it would eventually join the German Reich, a vision shared by a clear majority of its population at the time. The treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain prohibited a union of the two countries, but unification remained popular. In early 1921, several provincial governments hatched plans to break away from Austria and join Germany on their own; preparations for local referendums were made. Chancellor Michael Mayr ordered the would-be defectors to cease and desist but was ignored. Having lost its authority, the second Mayr government resigned on June 1, 1921. Schober looked like the man of the hour to politicians from all over the political spectrum.  Composition  The government consisted of the chancellor, the vice chancellor, and nine ministers. There were a number of idiosyncrasies. Chancellor Schober doubled as the minister of foreign affairs, but technically only in an acting capacity () and not as a minister proper. The Ministry of Nutrition of the Population too was led by an acting minister. The Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Education, historically independent but merged since the second Renner government, were not yet separated again, but in addition to the actual minister there was a state secretary () in charge of education affairs (). The Schober government, like its predecessor, depended on a coalition of Christian Social Party and Greater German People's Party for its support in the National Council. It therefore contained two symbolic Christian Social representatives and one symbolic People's Party delegate. The remaining eight of its eleven members were political independents. Department:  Office:  Officeholder:  Party: Three ministers were replaced on October 7, 1921:  Department:  Office:  Officeholder:  Party: The People's Party representative in the cabinet resigned on January 16, 1921; Schober took over from him:  Department:  Office:  Officeholder:  Party:  Activity  The emergency the Schober government had to deal with most urgently were the referendums on unification with Germany that a number of provinces were preparing. Schober convinced the provinces to abandon their plans. Schober succeeded where Mayr had failed partly because he was known to be pan-German himself, partly because he took, in addition to the chancellorship, personal control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Schober's installation as both the chancellor and the foreign minister created the impression ‚Äì the false impression, as it later turned out ‚Äì impression that the pan-German cause was in good hands and that unsolicited unilateral action on the part of the regional governments would not be needed. The provinces appeased, Schober next tried to improve Austria's poor relations with Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak foreign minister, Edvard Bene≈°, helpfully took the first step. Czechoslovakia had just created the Little Entente, an alliance of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania that was meant to restrain Hungarian claims against its neighbors and to thwart Italy's attempts to assert dominance over the region. An Austrian accession to the Little Entente or, failing that, an Austrian declaration of support for the Little Entente, would have been highly useful to Czechoslovakia. Bene≈° ventured to impress the benefits of an alliance with Czechoslovkia on the Austrian ambassador. In his reply to Bene≈°, Schober insisted that Austria would not be able to join the Little Entente ‚Äì due to the policy of neutrality that had been imposed on his rump state by the Treaty of Saint-Germain ‚Äì but that Schober would be more than happy to meet with Bene≈° in order to discuss what could be done instead. Schober also expressed his hope that Bene≈° would find it in his heart to help open up lines of credit for Austria, by putting in a good word for the country \\"in Paris and London\\". Bene≈° accepted the invitation. On August 10, 1921, Bene≈° and Tom√°≈° Masaryk, the Czechoslovak president, traveled to Hallstatt and negotiated a compact of mutual understanding and support with their Austrian counterparts, Schober and Michael Hainisch. In the Political Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czechoslovak Republic (), the two countries promised each other to honor the Treaty of Saint-Germain, to respect each other's borders, to support each other diplomatically, and to remain neutral if either of them should be attacked by a third party. They further promised each other not to tolerate any activity on their respective soil that aimed to undermine the security of the respectively other, and to support each other against any attempt to restore the Habsburg regime. The agreement was signed on December 16 during a return visit of the Austrians to L√°ny Castle, the summer seat of the Czechoslovak president. It became known as the Treaty of Lana () after the German name of the castle, . On the occasion of the exchange of signatures, Czechoslovakia promised to grant Austria an immediate loan of CZK 500 million and to support Austria's entreaties for more money in France and the United Kingdom.  Resignation  From the point of view of Schober, the Treaty of Lana was a resounding success. Austria had conceded nothing it had not conceded already in the Treaty of Saint-Germain. The treaty was a symbolic gesture, renewing old promises without making any new ones, but all the same a gesture that Czechoslovakia would handsomely reward. From the point of view of the People's Party, the treaty was tantamount to treason. The two defining platform planks of the People's Party were Antisemitism on the one hand and pan-Germanism on the other hand. The party had been hoping that Austria would, sooner or later, defy the Treaty of Saint-Germain and would seek accession to the German Reich. The party had also been hoping that the unification of all Germans would extend to the Sudeten Germans, the German-speaking former Habsburg subjects living in what used to be Bohemia. Schober, whom the party had considered a reliable ally, was renouncing both these goals. In the final days of December 1921, the People's Party staged protest rallies against the treaty all over the country. Protests were also organized by other pan-German groups, including the nascent Nazi Party. Adolf Hitler traveled from Munich to Vienna to rail against the treaty in front of some six hundred sympathizers, a notable early appearance. On January 16, 1922, the People's Party also withdrew its representative in Schober's cabinet, Leopold Waber. As long as Schober himself remained office, however, the People's Party was still bound by the original coalition agreement. The agreement required the party to vote in support of government bills in the National Council, and one of the government bills on the table in January 1922 was the ratification of the Treaty of Lana. Anxious to ensure the survival of the coalition, Schober defused the issue through resigning. On January 26, 1922, Schober stepped down. His vice chancellor Walter Breisky was sworn in as his successor, and the Treaty of Lana was ratified with the votes of Christian Socials and Social Democrats. The Breisky government was scrapped after a single day in office, and Schober returned to the chancellorship as the head of the second Schober government.

O'Farrell (February 23, 1823 ‚Äì October 29, 1900) was an Irish American adventurer, miner, and pioneer and was among the first residents of Boise, Idaho.  Early life and education  John Andrew O'Farrell was born February 13, 1823, in County Tyrone, Ireland, the son of Andrew and Ellen (O'Flaherty) O'Farrell. He attended National school until age 13 then transferred to a naval school in County Cork. At age 15, O'Farrell crewed aboard a steamship of the Oriental Line bound for Calcutta, India. At 16 he served 13 months aboard the Australian ship Nebob. Later he worked as a shipsmith for Captain William Coppin in Londonderry, and he crewed aboard a ship bound for the United States. In 1843 O'Farrell arrived in New York City, USA. He worked as a shipsmith at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and when the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War began, he sailed for California and was assigned to the Lexington.  California Gold Rush  While serving aboard the Lexington, O'Farrell met John Sutter at the settlement of Yerba Buena. He became a goldminer at Sutter's Mill, earning between $30 and $50 per day. When California became a state in 1850, O'Farrell automatically became a citizen of the United States.  Crimean War  O'Farrell returned to England in 1853 and enlisted in the British Navy during the Crimean War, serving aboard the Agamemnon, flagship of Admiral Lyons. He was wounded during the attack on Sevastopol and later received the Crimea Medal. Returning to California in 1856, O'Farrell soon joined the Pike's Peak Gold Rush and journeyed to Colorado in 1857, striking gold in 1860 at California Gulch.  Marriage and family  O'Farrell married Mary Ann Chapman on October 16, 1861, in Louisville, Kentucky. Leaving his wife in Philadelphia, he soon returned to mining in the western states and territories, and in 1863 he settled in Boise City, Idaho, becoming one of the town's original residents. He constructed a cabin from cottonwood trees near the entrance to the newly rebuilt Fort Boise, on the road to Idaho City. O'Farrell returned to Philadelphia then led a train of 14 wagons and members of his wife's family back to Boise City. The O'Farrells occupied the cabin until 1872, starting a family that included seven of their own children (three died in infancy) and seven adopted children. One of the adopted children, Rosa, was the niece of Chief Winnemucca. She lived with the O'Farrell's for 24 years until her death. The John A. O'Farrell Cabin was listed with the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on December 3, 1999. The O'Farrells were active in the Catholic church, and for years their cabin hosted church services. In 1869 O'Farrell donated land for the construction of St. Patrick's Church in Boise City, but the church burned 18 days after construction. In 1869, citing the Town Site Act of 1867, the General Land Office denied O'Farrell's claim to 442 acres that included the original plat of Boise City. The Idaho Statesman wrote of the case, \\"The evidence in this case shows that 500 buildings have been erected for dwellings, stores, etc.; that the population of the city is now 2000, and the improvements are valued at $1000.\\" The O'Farrells relocated to Park City, Utah, in the pursuit of mining 1871‚Äì1878, but they later returned to Boise City. In 1892 they built the John A. O'Farrell House. The house was listed with the NRHP on September 4, 1979. In the Brumbach Addition in Boise's North End, O'Farrell Street is named for John O'Farrell.

She wrote The Tailors of Tomaszow: A Memoir of Polish Jews, originally published in 2014, with her son Allan Chernoff.  Early life  Rena Margulies Chernoff's hometown is Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, formed in 1788 in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland by industrialist Tomasz Ostrowski. She is the daughter of Avram Chaim (Albert) Margulies, born March 8, 1909. Avram was a tailor and opened his own Parisian tailor workshop on August 10, 1931. Avram married Hinda Tenenbaum, who was the daughter of Hershel Tenenbaum and Raizel Kozlowska Tenenbaum, who were observant Orthodox Jews. Hinda became a dressmaker, and together with her husband worked in their tailoring shop, Tres Chic. Rena Chernoff was raised with the help of a Polish nanny, a rare luxury for Jewish families during this time period. Her younger brother, Romek, was born on August 24, 1935.  Surviving The Holocaust In the years leading up to World War II, millions of Jews were forced to live in urban ghettos. By December 1941, Hitler decided to kill all Jews living in Europe. During the Holocaust the population of European Jewish was reduced from 9,740,000 to 3,642,000. Chernoff's hometown of Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki, had nearly 14,000 Jewish residents prior to War World II; only 250 survived the Holocaust. Chernoff was six years old when Germany conquered Tomaszow. As a ten year old, she toiled in the Blizyn slave labor camp, 57 miles from Tomaszow in the Radom district of Poland, and was later moved to Birkenau, within the Auschwitz camp, where she was tattooed with the identification number A-15647.  Life in the United States At the war's end, Rena Chernoff and her mother had both survived the Holocaust. She and her mother returned to Tomaszow. There, they confronted anti-Semitism from local townspeople. They left Tomaszow in June 1946 to reside in a displaced persons camp in occupied Germany. She lived in the Schlachtensee Displaced Persons Camp from June 19 until August 7, 1946, and then in the Heidenheim camp until October 1949. On October 13, 1949, She emigrated to the United States, arriving in, New York on October 13, 1949. Chernoff found a new home in the United States, where she started a family, earned a master's degree, and became a teacher In 1992, Rena Chernoff took her son, daughter, and husband back to Poland. The Tailors of Tomaszow: A Memoir of Polish Jews Rena Margulies Chernoff and her son Allan Chernoff authored The Tailors of Tomaszow: A Memoir of Polish Jews, published in 2014. Rena Chernoff used this book to reveal her own experiences from the Holocaust, as well as a collective memoir of other survivors of Tomaszow. The Chernoffs believe the history of Holocaust is essential, and Allan has said that \\"if that history were not written down, if it were not recorded, it would be lost.\\" In the first part of this book, Chernoff describes her childhood, family, and the city of Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki. The second part of her book covers the history of Tomasz√≥w Mazowiecki and the Holocaust. She was one of the youngest survivors of the Holocaust and one of only 250 survivors from her town.

This was published in Baker‚Äôs Australian County Atlas (1844). Gardner's map reveals competent draughtsmanship and detailed attention to roads, tracks and pastoral properties. The economic depression impacted his employer and saw Gardner leave Saumarez station. His movements over the next few years are uncertain. He may have returned to Scotland. He certainly visited the United States where he visited cotton plantations in Georgia. By 1848 he was back in Australia where he wrote and published, The cultivation of the cotton plant in New South Wales (1848 & 1850).

It also saw action during the Second World War. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 19 mod√®le 1870/93 TAZ began life as twenty-six Canon de 19 C mod√®le 1870/93 coastal defense guns which were converted by Schneider to railroad guns early in the First World War. They were typical built-up guns of the period with mixed construction consisting of a rifled steel liner and several layers of iron reinforcing hoops. In French service, guns of mixed steel/iron construction were designated in centimeters while all steel guns were designated in millimeters. However, reference materials do not always distinguish the difference in construction and use either unit of measurement. The guns used a de Bange breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The first guns were converted and delivered to the French Army in the summer of 1915. The guns were mounted on a top carriage traversing mount with a large gun turret in the middle of an armored 4-axle rail carriage. The armor was sufficient to provide protection from shell splinters and gunfire. The ends of the carriage provided room for ammunition storage and the gun crew. The guns were normally connected to an ammunition car and the projectiles were passed from the ammunition car to the gun by an elevated chute. The turret was capable of 360¬∞ of traverse and carriages with this capability were known as Tous Azimuts or TAZ for short. Although capable of 360¬∞ of traverse the gun was returned to parallel the tracks so ammunition could be passed through to the gunners. The guns used a top-carriage recoil system where the gun sat on a cradle which held the trunnioned barrel. When fired a combination of hydraulic buffers and inclined rails on the firing platform returned the gun to position. The guns were capable of between -10¬∞ to +40¬∞ of elevation with a maximum range of and were often used for counter- battery fire. Once in position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wooden beams and a combination of screw jacks and rail clamps stabilized the carriage during firing. It shared the same carriage as the Canon de 164 mod√®le 1893/96 TAZ. World War II Twenty-four mle 1870/93 TAZ railway guns were mobilized at the beginning of the Second World War. Three guns were assigned to each of the batteries of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 16th, and 17th Heavy Artillery Batteries of the 374¬∞ Regiment of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e) stationed in Southern France facing the Italians. The 4th battery at Eze fired on the Italians advancing on Menton. After the fall of France, nine guns were used by the Germans as coastal defense artillery under the designation 19 cm K(E) 486(f). The Kingdom of Italy also received twelve guns after the Armistice of Villa Incisa and these were given the designation Cannone da 194/29 Modello 70/93. They were integrated into armored trains of the Royal Italian Army and assigned coastal defense duties. Guns in Italian service had their turret roofs removed.:it:194_mm_TAz_Mle._1870/93_ALVF#/media/File:Cannone_194_mm_mle_1870-93_ALVF_- _Montelungo.JPG] Their only action was 13 March 1944 with the Italian Co- belligerent Army during the Battle of Montelungo.

It was built in 1890. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Anglewood is the original name of Yean Cottage and of the whole Estate. It was built in the early 1890s by Arthur Bruce Smith, K.C., MHR., who was Secretary of Public Works for the Sir Henry Parkes government, later became the Colonial Treasurer. Contrary to the NSW Heritage Listing for the property, Arthur Bruce Smith was never Attorney-General for Australia. The design of the house and the interior layout is copied very closely from a house called Queensmead at Windsor U.K., designed for Colonel Reginald Talbot by Maurice Bingham Adams. Adams (1849-1933) was a prominent and influential British architect of the \\"Arts and Crafts\\" school of design. He worked for some years from 1872 as a staff member and then Editor of \\"Building News\\", illustrating all the most important \\"Queen Anne\\" buildings in engravings. Adams was notable for his furniture and interior designs in Queen Anne style, and as an architect for Bedford Park in Chiswick and Bournville near Birmingham became very much involved in the Garden Suburb movement. He became fashionable society architect and designed Caerleon in Bellevue Hill for Charles Fairyase. The construction of this house was supervised by Harvey Kent. The Smith family lived at Anglewood for 10 years from its completion in 1894 until 1904. It has been falsely rumoured that Smith decided it was too far to go all the way to Bowral to catch the train and that he built his own private railway station (Burradoo railway station), just outside his front gate so he could more conveniently board a train there. However Burradoo Station had actually existed since 1870 (24 years prior to Smith residing at Anglewood). As a result of the 1890s bank crash, the house was sold to George James Sly, founder of the firm Sly and Russell Solicitors, a large well known firm in the city of Sydney. Sly and his large family used it as their country house for many years. In 1932 Anglewood became a private school, an annexe to the King's School (Sydney).Cavanough et al, 1988, 55 Twelve years later it was commissioned as a special school for male truants by the then Department of Child Welfare - the first school of its kind in Australia. The main building, called Yean Cottage was opened by Clive Evatt, K.C., MLA., on 22 April 1944. Nattai Cottage was opened in 1946 (directly behind Yean Cottage) and Oxley Cottage in 1965. Anglewood continued to function as a special school for truants until 1979, having become co-educational in 1975.Heritage Office, 1988 The original expanse of the grounds has been altered to suit the requirements of a school. However the driveway and garden immediately surrounding the house remain intact. The driveway ends in a gently serpentine pattern, past the gatehouse which is sited to make the grounds appear more important than they are. From the driveway glimpses of the rear of the house are seen; it travels along the eastern side, leaving the view of the front until the last second. The turning circle is small, in the shape of a teardrop and is enclosed by a strip of evergreen planting, which includes once fashionable palms and succulents. Original wire arches are placed at regular intervals around the planting belt, taking visitors through to a lawn which is edged with a shelter belt of pines. The garden beds around the house are semi-circular, some edged with candystick moulded terracotta tiles, and the others with bricks set on a 45 degree angle for a saw tooth effect. The flower bed adjoining the eastern wing of the house is a geometric horse-shoe shaped design dissected by a path of crazy paving. The serpentine paths to the rear of the house would once have taken visitors through a series of colourful flower beds and shrubs that would have led to simply-planted woodland.Cavanough et al, 1988, 55, 57 In 1980, the Department of Youth and Community Services changed the function of the Unit to cater for 24 male and female adolescent State Wards, aged 10 years to 18 years.Heritage Office 1988 In 1999 approval was granted to adaptively reuse Yean Cottage as an hotel and subdivide its grounds for cluster housing.  Description  =House= Anglewood is a very large and elaborately decorated Queen Anne Revival style house, with an extensive and very fine garden. The design of the house and the interior layout is copied very closely from Queensmead Cottage at Windsor, built when the Queen Anne Style was at its most elaborate flowering was a collection of all Adams' ideas on Queen Anne. Anglewood faithfully follows much of this idiom, elaborating on some, such as the arched brick bracing between chimneys at the east end and giving an Australian flavour to others such as Australian plants appearing in moulded plaster detailing. The exterior of Anglewood is principally a soft red brick, much of it moulded or carved in finely detailed ornament. The bricks are said to have been imported from England especially for the house but this has not been established. The first floor is timber framed and clad in terracotta shingling, hung with patterned bands of cut tiles. The walls of the first floor bay over the entrance are clad in rough cast render, as are gable ends and bands under some of the eaves. Much of the decoration is very unusual and possibly unique in Australia. Around the entrance bay, at string course level, are a series of curved sandstone blocks with shields, gargoyles, mashs, acanteurs etc. This work is very fine and appears to be in perfect condition. Inside are fine timber panelling, moulded plaster, faience panels, colourful tiles and stained glass. Above the entrance hall was a three-storey central light well with coloured clerestroey lighting, now covered over at each floor level. There is a pleasant conservatory on the garden front. Quite a few alterations have been made internally, but some care has been taken not to destroy original material. A modern addition on the west side has occurred as is an external fire stair on the east end. It was reported to be in good physical condition as at the time of its heritage listing. Quite a few alterations have been made internally, but some care has been taken not to destroy original material. =Grounds= The house is surrounded by a superb garden with a magnificent collection of mature exotic trees and a most interesting collection of conifers. Much of the garden design dates back to when the house was built. The original expanse of the grounds has been altered to suit the requirements of a school. However the driveway and garden immediately surrounding the house remain intact. The driveway ends in a gently serpentine pattern, past the gatehouse which is sited to make the grounds appear more important than they are. From the driveway glimpses of the rear of the house are seen; it travels along the eastern side, leaving the view of the front until the last second. The turning circle is small, in the shape of a teardrop and is enclosed by a strip of evergreen planting, which includes once fashionable palms and succulents. Original wire arches are placed at regular intervals around the planting belt, taking visitors through to a lawn which is edged with a shelter belt of pines. The garden beds around the house are semi- circular, some edged with candystick moulded terracotta tiles, and the others with bricks set on a 45 degree angle for a saw tooth effect.

The serpentine paths to the rear of the house would once have taken visitors through a series of colourful flower beds and shrubs that would have led to simply-planted woodland.  Heritage listing  Anglewood was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is a climactic example of the full flowering of the \\"Queen Anne\\" Arts and Crafts school of architectural and interior design. It is associated with and a direct copy by Maurice B. Adams, R.I.B.A., a prominent and influential British architect of the Arts and Crafts school and a leading exponent of the Queen Anne Revival style. Adams is also represented in Australia through his design in Bellevue Hill for Charles Fairfax. It is associated with the Hon. Arthur Bruce Smith K.C., M.H.R., Secretary of Public Works and Colonial Treasurer under Parkes in NSW and first Federal Attorney General who has the house built as a country retreat. It is associated with its purchaser, George James Sly, founder of the well-known firm of solicitors, Sly and Russell, who used it as a country house for at least 40 years. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It has an outstanding country house style of garden with many magnificent specimens of mature exotic trees, lawns, formal garden beds and a most unusual and varied collection of conifers. The garden illustrates the changes in design of garden layout and choice in plantings which have taken place from the 1890s when the garden was developed to the 1950s when the design was influenced by a keen gardener on the school staff. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has long association with an innovative government philosophy in youth training and education through its use as a home and special school for truants. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is a rare and intact example in Australia of a style of architecture in its fully developed and richly decorated form, more often seen in the U.K. in country mansions and large town houses of the late 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Both the exterior and interior form and detailing are representative of the most developed form of the Queen Anne Arts and Crafts school of architectural interior design.

His firm has designed and developed high end residential and commercial office properties such as 25 Mercer in SoHo, 177 Franklin Street in TriBeCa which was the Shinola flagship and headquarters, and the Emerson at 500 West 25th Street, adjacent to the High Line. The firm is currently developing class A office buildings at 205 West 28th Street, 120 Tenth Avenue, and 1245 Broadway, which is scheduled to open in 2021. Kirchmann's firm has also designed and renovated more than 4,000 units of affordable housing in New York City, including Campos Plaza in the East Village, Bronxchester Houses in the Bronx, Marcus Garvey Village in Brooklyn, and Arverne View in Rockaway, Queens. Formerly a Design Director at architecture firm Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, Kirchmann worked on projects across the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Career In 1997, he joined SOM in New York City, where he became a Director of the New York office. Notable completed projects include the corporate headquarters of Oracle in Paris, the Arcapita headquarters in Bahrain, and the Park Hotel in Hyderabad, which is the first LEED Platinum certified hotel in India. Kirchmann worked with SOM partner Roger Duffy on these projects. In 2007, and after a 10-year tenure at SOM, Kirchmann founded GDSNY, a design and real estate development firm with offices in New York. Notable projects include the Bahrain Bay master plan, 149 Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the Dogpound gyms in New York and Los Angeles, and 25 Mercer. Kirchmann is a frequent lecturer and juror at Harvard University, New York University, Cityscape, MIPIM, the Architectural Association, Parsons School of Design, and the University of Pennsylvania. He taught in the Masters of Science in Real Estate program at Columbia University from 2010 to 2015 with SOM partner Chris Cooper and Vishaan Chakrabarti. Projects Kirchmann has designed more than 4,000 units of low-income housing that have been completed in New York City, including the redevelopment at Arverne View (formerly known as Ocean Village) in Rockaway, Queens, a region that was devastated by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In 2015 Kirchmann designed the extensive renovation of the low income, 625-unit Marcus Garvey Village spread across nine city blocks, in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. Originally designed in 1973 by Kenneth Frampton, the project achieved notability at the time for its innovative urban planning approach to low-rise, high-density affordable housing. The renovated property was awarded the Building Brooklyn Award for Affordable Housing Preservation and the Affordable Housing Magazine Award of Excellence. In 2016 Kirchmann collaborated with Fabien Baron to design the Dogpound, an exclusive gym located in the West Village and reportedly frequented by Hollywood celebrities, Olympic athletes, and Victoria's Secret Angels, including Elsa Hosk, Adriana Lima, Josephine Skriver, and Romee Strijd. Kirchmann appeared in the 2017 season of Bravo‚Äôs Million Dollar Listing New York with real estate broker Fredrik Eklund, who shows several units from Kirchmann's development at 25 and 27 Mercer Street. Kirchmann collaborated with American artist Leo Villareal to create enhanced environments integrating LED and video elements into the architecture at the Bahrain International Airport. Prior to starting renovation work on 25 and 27 Mercer Street for what would eventually become a luxury condominium development in two historic cast-iron buildings in SoHo, Kirchmann collaborated with British artist Shantell Martin, who installed drawings on two floors of the buildings, as well as light artist Matthew Schreiber, American Ballet Theatre dancer Kathryn Boren, and fashion photographer Nigel Barker. Some of Martin's drawings remained intact throughout construction and became part of the foundation of the building. =GDSNY= * 1245 Broadway, New York, New York (2020) * 205 West 28th Street, New York, New York (2021) * 118 10th Avenue, New York, New York (2022) * 177 Franklin Street, Tribeca, New York City (2012) * Marcus Garvey Apartments, Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York (2015) * Arverne View, Far Rockaways, Queens, New York (2015) * 25‚Äì27 Mercer Street SoHo, New York City (2016) * 149 Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, New York (2016) * Campos Plaza, East Village, New York (2016) * Bronxchester, Bronx, New York (2016) * The DOGPOUND, West Village, New York (2016) * The DOGPOUND, West Hollywood, California (2019) * 500 West 25th Street, Chelsea, New York (2018) =Skidmore, Owings and Merrill= * Portes de la Defense, Oracle Headquarters, Paris, France * Arcapita Bank Headquarters, Manama, Bahrain * The Park Hotel, Hyderabad, India * The Four Seasons Hotel, Manama, Bahrain * Defense Plaza, Paris, France * Arcs de Seine, Paris, France See also *Roger Duffy *T.

It was worked from 1886 to 1986. It is also known as The Gib. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 December 2013.  History  Quarrying commenced in the Mount Gibraltar area following the opening of the railway in 1867. William Chaker commenced operations at the site in 1885 at the top of Cliff Street when he opened the NSW Trachyte Stone Quarrying Company (Quarry D). The \\"Gibraltar Rock Quarries\\" were opened by Messrs Leggat and Company in 1886. John Leggat supplied the Bowral Trachyte piers for the Hawkesbury River railway bridge, his last major project before going broke, still the largest scale use of the stone. By 1888 Loveridge and Hudson, who had been quarrying poorer quality stone at Quarry A at the top of Oxley Street, took over Chaker's quarry. Notable builders of the period, they had blocks quarried for buildings such as the Equitable Life Building (George Street, Sydney) the Australasia Bank (corner of Martin Place, Sydney) and the anchor blocks for the Hampden Bridge in Kangaroo Valley. By 1890 the Pope family was quarrying blocks (Quarry C leased from John Thompson) of which the largest was 9 tons 7 hundredweight; these became part of a gate pillar for Centennial Park (Sydney). The blocks were often taken out by rail from a specially constructed siding in Bowral. The quarries also provided local building stone and several quarries provided kerb stones and tramway supports for local towns as well as Sydney. In 1881 the Amos Brothers acquired Quarry E on the western face of Mount Gibraltar, along Soma Avenue (Amos spelt backward). By 1888 they were producing stone for railway ballast. In 1890 the government resumed part of their land and opened the Government Ballast Quarry (Quarry F). This closed after 2 years and after a court case, Alexander Amos got back the land that had been resumed. The NSW Government quarry on the Mittagong side, supplied rock to a crusher via a double light rail system. There were a great many quarrymen and stonemasons working at the time, some living in poor circumstances in temporary dwellings on top of the mountain. There were many accidents and the men formed the \\"Berrima District Workmen's Accident Relief and Endowment Fund\\" as a result. At his death in 1915, Alexander Amos owned most of the northern and western sides of the mountain. The administrators of his estate sold the summit site to Joshua Stokes, on behalf of the Bowral Municipal Council, for a future reserve while the lower portions were subdivided for housing. As early as 1894 the Government geologist, E. F. Pittman urged the use of Bowral Trachyte \\"for any important building in which permanence might be desired. The \\"trachyte\\" may, for all practical purposes, be regarded as indestructible\\".Dept Mines Annual Report, 1894, p. 104 When Edwards Raht chose the Bowral material for 350 George Street (Equitable Building) he compared it to Cologne Cathedral saying it would last for not a hundred years but a thousand. The trachyte was described in 1915 as being \\"very solid. Its weight-carrying capacity is equal to most of the known granites\\". The use of Bowral Trachyte by Sydney City's engineers as a hard rock to replace crumbling sandstone kerbs and gutters was thought to be the catalyst which if not initiated, certainly spurred The Gib's development; the use as a building material came later. Perhaps without the quarry's' successes in developing and serving a market for hard rock, the stone's potential as a superb building material might never have been realised. It was thus used extensively in late 19th century Sydney for facades but also for foundations, flagging and for bridge piers, notably in the Hawkesbury (Brooklyn) Bridge. In 1914 trachyte was sent to London and Scotland. The stone was used locally for monuments, public works and private buildings. The columns of the Queen Victoria Building are made from Bowral Trachyte and were turned on the Abernethy and Co Stonemason's Lathe, which is also listed on the State Heritage Register. At least 16 structures constructed using Bowral Trachyte are listed on the SHR. During the depression the Minister for Local Government, Eric Spooner, visited Mount Gibraltar announcing that 60,000 pounds would be made available for relief work. By 1936 the new road and lookouts on Mount Gibraltar were completed. The following year Spooner had plans prepared for the development of parking and picnicking areas on the site. As in earlier periods these workers camped onsite, creating another depression \\"Struggletown\\". The purchase of land for a Reserve by Joshua Stokes led to him losing public office for a perceived waste of public money. It was not until after World War II that the local Council implemented a programme of expanding Stokes' original 59 acre purchase. Stokes' forethought was not honoured until 1950 by the construction of the John Stokes Memorial on Mount Gibraltar. By 1973 only Quarry C was active and changes in building methods and materials had reduced the demand for Bowral Trachyte. There were also strong community concerns over the impacts that quarrying was having on the beauty of the site. Additionally, quality of life near to the quarry was an emerging concern with the regular blasting and expulsion of 'Pope's Dust' into the air. Negotiations with F. J. Pope and Sons saw the quarry close down. Ten years later an application was made to quarry stone for the extension of the National Library of Australia in Canberra. In the face of community opposition a deal was struck allowing a small amount of stone to be quarried, but with the remaining active quarry being sold to Council at its completion. The remaining quarrying sites were incorporated into the reserve in 1986. In 2003 the Department of Public Works removed some loose blocks to repair the steps of the State Library of New South Wales. The land was neglected until 1995 when a volunteer management committee was formed under the auspices of Wingecarribee Shire Council to \\"care control and manage the reserve\\". Weed containment activities have been carried out, subsequently revealing some of the former quarry structures. The Mount Gibraltar Landcare and Bushcare Group ahs been involved with structural projects at the site since its inception in 1995, the following projects have been undertaken by the group: * 1995: Inner Bowl Carpark. * 1996: Bowral Lookout: Steps to Plinth and Paving and Concrete Path to Gents Toilet and Rim Track. * 1996: Jellore Lookout: Steps and platform. * 1999: Jellore Lookout: Concrete path to Lookout * 2000: Jellore Lookout: Entrance wall. * 2001: Bowral Lookout: Wheelchair Access track. * 2001: Removed damaged Lions Shelter Shed. * 2002: Mittagong Lookout: Walls and Path. * 2003: Bowral Lookout: Walls. * 2005: Inner Bowl restoration, roof and table. * 2010: Bowral Lookout: Landscaping. * 2011: Heritage Quarries Circuit Track. The quarrying was an integral part of the lives of those living in Bowral with the 4pm event, a huge, dull thud shaking windows and vases. The following description is from a resident at the time:  Description  The quarries have created considerable scars in the side of Mount Gibraltar and are most visible from the southern/Bowral side. At close quarters the works cliffs are impressive with walls of up to 50 metres. The site contains rubble which is used from time to time for current projects, e.g. plinths for plaques and landscaping work within the reserve. The remnants of the site's industrial heritage are present with various items hidden under encroaching weeds, and infrastructure such as road/track ways, loading benches etc. are emerging due to the ongoing weed eradication programme. Also contained within the Reserve are several stone structures and steps built during the 1930s through a Spooner Unemployment Program. Part of the same program saw the construction of the Scenic Loop Road and an impressive retaining wall on the western side. These structures comprise the following: Stone Stairway; Bowral Lookout Shelter and picnic table: male and female WC building; Inner Bowl Shelter, Oxley View Shelter, ruined shelter on corner of Scenic Loop, Mt Jellore Lookout and shelter, Mittagong Lookout shelter and Joshua Stokes Memorial. In general the quarry sites are considerably overgrown, although some portion have been cleared. A network of walking trails runs through the reserve. As a result of clearance programs, some artefacts and infrastructure have been recovered, e.g. steps cut into the rock face, machinery, building materials, etc. The nominated quarries all lie within the Mount Gibraltar Reserve where the rock supports the Endangered Ecological Community of Mount Gibraltar Forest, now regenerating after 15 years of weed removal. Some quarries were reported to be currently infested by weeds as at 26 November 2012. The site is considered to have moderate to high archaeological potential, as evidenced by the recovery of artefacts from beneath vegetation regrowth; sub-surface deposits are highly likely. =Quarries at Mount Gibraltar= * Quarry A Loveridge and Hudson 1888 * Quarry C: Rayward, Pope 1889-1979 * Quarry D: Chalker, Loveridge and Hudson 1885 - 1986 * Quarry E: Amos, Mascot 1894-1962 * Quarry F: Government 1890 -1892  Heritage listing  Mount Gibraltar Quarries are significant as purpose built quarries that were used consistently for 100 years of quarrying, from 1886 to 1986. Today there are six distinct quarrying locations regarded as being historically significant. The trachyte quarried there is unique and provided dimension stone for notable buildings throughout NSW and internationally. The quarries were an important aspect of Bowral's industrial history. The stone is geologically known as microsyenite and was commercial traded as Bowral Trachyte. Bowral Trachyte became popular for kerbing in the later nineteenth and early twentieth century. The use of Bowral Trachyte by Sydney City's engineers as a hard rock to replace crumbling sandstone kerbs and gutters was the very catalyst which if not initiated, certainly spurred The Gib's development. It was used locally in some quantity, but the bulk of it was exported to Sydney for major city buildings (Challis House, Martin Place; National Mutual Building, George Street; QVB, George Street; ANZAC Memorial, Hyde Park) and major public works (Hawkesbury River Bridge at Brooklyn). These structures have been listed on the State Heritage Register for their architectural, technical and engineering qualities. The trachyte from Bowral and the quarries from which it was extracted are significant for their contribution to the built heritage of the State. The stone from these quarries was used for the commemorative stones for Federation and for the foundation of Canberra and many war memorials. The ballast quarry was important to the construction of the Great Southern Railway line from Mittagong to Goulburn, in the late 19th century. For a hundred years stonemasons and quarrymen used their remarkable skills for blasting, cutting, trimming, polishing and handling the dense rock. The technologies of the time have technical significance and the quarries, as an entity, formed the basis of social development in Bowral as many families were involved with their operation. It was a major industry for the township of Bowral. An important Spooner depression relief program supported the region by using the stone for improvements on the mountain. Mount Gibraltar is a volcanic intrusion that cooled in such a way as to form this special rock. 180 million years of erosion have exposed the rock. Mount Gibraltar Microsyenite is the technical term for the stone which was marketed as \\"Bowral Trachyte\\" at the time in the belief it would be exempt from Government tax. Bowral Trachyte, has the unique properties of great strength and durability and decorative potential when polished plus accessibility for quarrying. These quarries are of State significance due to the fact that microsyenite of this quality, both aesthetically and functionally, is rare internationally. The rock was studied by our great geologists such as Andrew Griffith Taylor, Edgeworth David and Douglas Mawson. Architects such as Walter Liberty Vernon, George Macrae, Edward E. Raht; builders such as John Leggat, Loveridge and Hudson, Amos Brothers, Saunders, Phippard Bros., Melocco Bros. and engineers of the railways, road, bridges and dams made use of the stone.Lemann et. al. 2007 The Mount Gibraltar Quarries are a significant industrial landscape. Although overgrown, with many elements relocated, the quarries retain many elements of their industrial heritage including; scars of the quarrying that show how the stone was removed (plug and feather technique), machinery and the remains of trackways and tramways. The Mount Gibraltar Forest is significant due to its rarity, being identified as an endangered ecological community under the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act and threatened ecological community under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The unique geology of the area supports a collection of flora that, as an assemblage, does not exist outside of the Reserve. Mount Gibraltar Trachyte Quarries Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 December 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It meets this criterion at State level because the quarries were a source of distinctive material for late Victorian to interwar construction of numerous significant public buildings, roads and railways and commemorative structures in NSW and internationally. At least 16 State significant buildings listed on the SHR have been constructed using Bowral Trachyte. This site is significant in the development of the built heritage of NSW. The quarries supported a major depression relief program which constructed the Scenic Loop road over Mount Gibraltar and the infrastructure of shelters and lookouts for passive recreation in the Reserve. The quarries also supported the construction of the Great Southern Railway which opened the region up for further settlement and tourism and contributed greatly to the economic development of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The quarries meet this criteria at a local level as they evoke and acknowledge the fraternity of the quarrymen, builders and stonemasons who worked this site and the thousands of people employed in Depression era works programs. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It meets the criterion at State level because of its ability to demonstrate the skill and industrial technology of the stoneworkers in managing the extremely hard and durable rock. The quarries are able to demonstrate the quarrying techniques and products of the late 19th to late 20th centuries. The technology required to cut and polish the very hard rock was remarkable, as was the ability to handle its weight. The massive quarry scars also provide an aesthetic component to the landscape of the iconic landmark of Mount Gibraltar. This is the highest point between Sydney and Canberra and is a considerable regional presence. The Mount Gibraltar Reserve is accessible to the public and reflects the character of the rock in its infrastructure. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It meets this criterion at local level because the quarry is a natural reserve that is utilised by the local community for recreation activities. It is also an important tourist destination, contributing to the economy of the region. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion at State level because there is potential for further understanding of the quarrying industry and the scientific understanding of the unique rock. The quarry represents a potential archaeological resource with the archaeological remnants of the entire quarrying process likely present. The site provides opportunities to understand study and interpret quarrying and stone finishing techniques of the past. The unique nature of the ecological community at this site represents an opportunity to further study and understand this community of plants. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion at a State level because the quarries reveal the unique quality of the rock that also supports the natural endangered ecological community of Mount Gibraltar Forest. The Mount Gibraltar Quarries are considered to be exceptionally rare and possibly unique due to the rarity of the materials quarried there, particularly Bowral Trachyte; this material was only extracted from Mount Gibraltar and was a favoured building stone for many impressive buildings in Sydney, statewide and internationally. The ecological communities on the site have been identified as being rare at both a State and national level. The site is considered to be rare in a local, State and international context The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It meets this criterion at a State level because they are representative of the extraordinary skills of the early industrial era in NSW. They represent an industrial landscape that contains the remnants of the quarrying process and its impact on the development of the built heritage of NSW.

Malone with pool balls. (1887) Fifteen-ball pool, also known as sixty-one pool, is a nineteenth century American pocket billiards game that developed from pyramid pool. Created by members of the Bassford's Billiard & Chess Rooms in Manhattan during the late 1830s or 1840s, it is the ancestor to most American pool games. Rules The game is played on a six pocket table with fifteen numbered red racked in triangle and a white . The 15-ball is the ball and is placed at the . Behind it are the other high numbered balls with the rest in the back rows, most likely in descending order. The number of the ball pocketed by a player scores the player that number of points. The goal is to get the highest number of points (when there are more than two players) or become the first player to get 61 or more points (being more than half of the total of all the ball numbers combined) to win a . Tournament matches consist of winning the best out of 21 frames. It is possible to lose a frame despite sinking twice the number of balls over the winner. Three points are subtracted for each ; three consecutive fouls will cost the player the frame. In 1880, a new rule to discourage required the cue ball to make contact with an object ball in each shot. This must cause an object ball to be pocketed or at least one ball to hit the cushion. Legacy This game was the inspiration behind rotation which shares the point system. The first tournament was held in 1878 at the Union Square Billiard Rooms in New York City which was won by the Canadian Cyrille Dion who defeated Gotthiel Wahlstrom of Sweden. Alfredo de Oro recalled that in 1887, an English spectator pointed out that Albert M. Frey won despite pocketing less balls than his opponent John L. Malone. He offered 200 dollars for a rematch in which the first person to pot a hundred balls would win; Frey won again. This game became known as continuous pool and its first tournament was held in 1888 which was also won by Frey. Continuous would go on to become 14.1 continuous after Jerome R. Keogh's reforms in 1910.

Yakult Honsha is a multinational corporation that sells various other products and owns the Tokyo Yakult Swallows baseball team. The company regularly promotes what the Financial Times called its \\"idiosyncratic philosophy of 'Shirota-ism'\\", namely that it should sell its products at an affordable price, and that a healthy intestine promotes longer life. History A Yakult lady in Japan Since 1963, Yakult has employed women known as \\"Yakult ladies\\" („É§„ÇØ„É´„Éà„É¨„Éá„Ç£„Éº; Yakuruto redƒ´) or \\"Yakult aunties\\" („É§„ÇØ„É´„Éà„Åä„Å∞„Åï„Çì; Yakuruto obasan) to sell or deliver the products to individuals at their homes while traveling on bicycles or motorcycles. The initiative, meant to utilize Japanese women in the workforce, is responsible for up to 60% of all bottled Yakult sales. However, the number of Yakult ladies in Japan has declined from 65,700 in 1973 to 42,500 in 2009. In the early 1980s, Carlos Kasuga, whose parents immigrated to Mexico from Japan in the 1930s, founded Yakult Mexico. In 1998, the company gained international attention for its losses in the derivatives market, totaling US$813 million. In 2000, The Japan Times reported that Yakult Honsha had been paying a criminal syndicate annually to keep them from disrupting shareholder meetings, but that the money was concealed as payments to an advertising company. Yakult established a US subsidiary and committed to building a factory in Fountain Valley, California in the United States in 2010, and it began production in 2014. Yakult is manufactured and sold in India under a 50:50 joint-venture with Danone. For over a decade, Danone owned 21 percent of Yakult Honsha shares, but in 2018 Danone announced it would reduce its holdings in Yakult to 7 percent, while still remaining the largest Yakult Honsha shareholder.

It was built in the early 1880s. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Kurkulla was constructed in the early 1880s for widow Lucy Berthon, who operated a boarding and day school at Marrickville. She reportedly intended to open a girls school in the Bowral house; however, this did not occur, and she instead moved to Nowra in 1891. Following Berthon's departure, English classical scholar J. Lee Pulling conducted a boarding school for boys at Kurkulla from 1891 until 1895 or 1897, with sources conflicting as to the date of its closure. Olympic swimmer and World War I casualty Cecil Healy was one of Pulling's pupils at Kurkulla. The property was regularly advertised for sale from 1903, and in 1909 it was purchased by Sydney merchant William Robert Evans, for his sister, Ada Evans. Both were keen gardeners and transformed it into a self-supporting farm. Ada Evans was born in England on 17 May 1872 and consequently the gardens in the immediate vicinity of the dwelling house have a beautiful and distinctly European flavour. By 1902 Ada Evans had become Australia's first woman to graduate from the law school at the University of Sydney, but after applying to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales was refused admission to the Bar, as the law at that time disqualified woman from holding a position. After a determined legal battle, culminating in the Women's Legal Status Act of 1918 which was passed by the Holman state government, she became the first woman in New South Wales to qualify for admission to the Bar but then had to be a student of law for two years. Finally on the 12 May 1921 she became the first woman to be admitted to the Bar in New South Wales, opening up the legal profession here to females for the first time. The Australian Law Journal of 20 May 1948 described Evans' struggle to gain admittance to the Bar as \\"heroic pioneering for women in the profession\\". Evans lived in Kurkulla from 1909 until her death in 1947 and undoubtedly considered it her home. Evans Lane in which the property stands is named in her honour.Branch Managers Report 286/86 Following Evans' death, Kurkulla passed to her niece, Joan Kyngdon (1907-1997), who lived in the property until 1996. The property was restored prior to 2006 for then owners Dr. Louella and radiologist Tony Grattan-Smith by the architectural practice of Howard Tanner and Associates (now Tanner Kibble Denton), with a newly built self-contained studio adjacent to the homestead, an in-ground heated swimming pool and tennis court.Sydney Morning Herald Domain, 5-6 July 2014Meares & associates, 2013 The Grattan- Smiths sold it in 2006 to investment banker Peter Kennedy (for $4.375m). Kennedy sold it to neurologist Roger Tuck and his wife Leigh in 2011 for $4.25m, following the sale of their Gunning cattle farm Baroon in 2010. The Tucks put Kurkulla onto the real estate market in 2013 and 2014. It sold for $3,775,000 in November 2015.  Description  =Homestead= Kurkulla is a single storey painted brick residence constructed of hand made (painted) bricks, iron roof, verandah to two (the eastern and northern) sides, three paned french doors.Heritage Council Branch Managers Report 286/86 Built c.1880s. It features polished timber floors, rooms of excellent proportion, and 12' pressed-metal Wunderlich ceilings.Advertisement, 2015 The house as a gable fronted projecting bay on north elevation with an unusual bay window in a segmented circle form. Timber framed verandah has stop chamfered columns with neck mouldings. Verandah floor is tiled. The east elevation also features a projecting porch (timber framed) supported on masonry piers with a pressed metal ceiling (well overgrown with wisteria (Wisteria sinensis). Later verandah enclosures include use of pressed metal for walls and ceilings. The house is well set back from the road on a site with many mature trees (Monterey pines, Pinus radiata etc.). =Setting and garden= The homestead is situated on 3 hectares opposite the Mt.GibraltarSMH, 5-6/7/14on a rise close to Bowral township with long views to the north over paddocks and bush. It includes a pond and more informal areas of woodland garden, and a copse of black locust/false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), a popular 19th-century farm sheller belt species). The property has dual entrances.W.M.Carpenter & Associates, advertisement, 6/2015 A gravel drive approaches the house, which is flanked by lawns and shrubberies and borders with old-fashioned perennials (e.g. flag iris, Erigeron karvinskianus daisies), roses, smaller shrubs such as Camellia japonica cv.s, hedges of various kinds) and sheltered by tall conifers - a row of Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) to the north, and a large Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) near the house. The garden is secluded.Meares, 2013 The grounds include a heated in-ground swimming pool and a tennis court, netted, with a separate guest pavilion overlooking it at one end and with a greenhouse.SMH, 5-6 July 2014 A sheltered, north-facing entertaining area is between the house and a guest studio and deck.Carpenter, 2015 =Studio= A newly built self-contained studio is adjacent to the homestead.  Heritage listing  Kurkulla is considered to be an item of the State's environmental heritage due to its historical significance as the home of the late Ada Evans, the first woman to be admitted to the New South Wales Bar and famous for her pioneering work for females in the legal profession in New South Wales, and indeed Australia. Kurkulla is significant within the local community generally as evidence of the towns 19th century residential development and as a contributor to Bowral's important stock of early buildings and townscape features. The building and its setting also has aesthetic significance within the town as a representative example of a late 19th-century homestead - this significance being enhanced by the degree to which it has retained original fabric and features but compromised by later unsympathetic alterations, especially to the main elevations. Kurkulla was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The Norwegian Coastal Express Museum () is located at Richard Withs plass (Richard With Square) in Stokmarknes in Nordland county‚Äîa natural location because the Coastal Express was \\"born\\" here. The museum is operated by the Coastal Express Museum Association and it includes the former coastal express ship from the Vester√•len Steamship Company. The museum was officially opened by Transport Minister Kjell Opseth on July 2, 1993‚Äîthe 100th anniversary of the first coastal express voyage. The museum then received its premises in the old administration building of the Vester√•len Steamship Company. In 1999 the museum was relocated to a new location in the Coastal Express Building (Hurtigrutens Hus) next to the Coastal Express dock. Purpose The articles of association of the Coastal Express Museum Association state that \\"The purpose of the association is to establish and operate a Coastal Express Museum at Stokmarknes.\\" The association's tasks consist of maintaining and preserving buildings and objects belonging to the museum. This is done in cooperation with the responsible professionals at the Vester√•len Museum in Melbu. The museum showcases the history of the Coastal Express for visitors and is an information center for coastal culture and a professional resource for schools, institutions, and organizations involved in cultural protection. History The Coastal Express Building (Hurtigrutens Hus) at the Coastal Express Museum The first idea for creating a museum in Stokmarknes dedicated to the Coastal Express took shape in 1980. During the 1980s, the concept was developed into a plan and a project. An interim administration for the museum was elected in 1989, and that same year the Coastal Express Museum Association was founded. In the summer of 1991 the museum was unofficially opened; it was still limited in size and being developed. The museum was officially opened on July 2, 1993 by Transport Minister Kjell Opseth on the centenary of the day that started the first voyage from Trondheim on the coastal express route. One year later, the museum received an enormous gift from the Ofoten and Vesteraalen Steamship Company: the retired coastal express ship MS Finnmarken (1956). On May 3, 1999, the ship traveled to the Kaarb√∏ Shipyard in Harstad for sandblasting and preparation for moving it to land. On June 16, 1999 MS Finnmarken left the water and was put on display at the Coastal Express Museum. It is one of the world's largest museum pieces. The state paid for transferring the ship to land, but explicitly stated that the museum's operating costs had to be covered locally. The ship has been exposed to water intrusion since it was moved to land. A temporary roof and tarpaulin were installed on the ship in an effort to limit moisture damage while discussing how and whether MS Finnmarken is to be preserved. A committee led by the Nordland county municipality delivered its report on January 25, 2007. Several solutions were outlined, including installing a new building around the entire ship at a cost of NOK 70 to 140 million. The cheapest option is to cut up the ship (at a cost around NOK 19 million). A third possibility is to let the ship stand outdoors as it is now, with minor superstructures at a cost of NOK 36 million. The report concludes that most of the costs of the Coastal Express Museum are connected with maintaining MS Finnmarken. The state has shown little willingness to take over the operation of the Coastal Express Museum, but it provided funds to build the temporary roof to prevent further deterioration while discussing the matter. The Ministry of Transport and Communications insists that local funding of the museum's operation was a prerequisite when funds were provided to move the ship to land. At the beginning of 2009, the Coastal Express Museum and Hurtigruten AS entered into an agreement that round-trip passengers on the express route would receive free admission to the museum in return for the museum receiving NOK 25 per visitor from the express route. This led to a 140% increase in visitor numbers in the first quarter of 2009 of compared to the first quarter of 2008. On February 25, 2009, the Nordland County Council approved a grant of NOK 20 million to the Coastal Express Museum, with the prerequisite that the municipality of Hadsel contribute another 20 million, and the state 60 million. On June 18, 2009, the Hadsel Municipal Council decided to provide guarantees of NOK 20 million. Including the government's contribution, NOK 100 million will be made available to build a permanent protective structure over MS Finnmarken. It was also decided to establish a municipal enterprise to build and serve as the owner of a newer and more compact Coastal Express Museum.

Nomenclature and classification Superfamilies are identified by shared DNA sequence and ability to respond to the same transposase. Common features of hAT transposons include a size of 2.5-5 kilobases with short terminal inverted repeats and short flanking target site duplications generated during the transposition process. The hAT superfamily's name derives from three of its members: the hobo element from Drosophila melanogaster, the Activator or Ac element from Zea mays, and the Tam3 element from Antirrhinum majus. The superfamily has been divided based on bioinformatics analysis into at least two clusters defined by their phylogenetic relationships: the Ac family and the Buster family. More recently, a third group called Tip has been described. Family members The hAT transposon superfamily includes the first transposon discovered, Ac from Zea mays (maize), first reported by Barbara McClintock. McClintock was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983 for this discovery. The family also includes a subgroup known as space invaders or SPIN elements, which have very high copy numbers in some genomes and which are among the most efficient known transposons. Although no extant active example is known, laboratory-generated consensus sequences of active SPIN elements are able to generate high copy numbers when introduced to cells from a wide range of species. Distribution hAT transposons are widely distributed across eukaryotic genomes, but are not active in all organisms. Inactive hAT transposon sequences are present in mammal genomes, including the human genome; they are among the transposon families believed to have been present in the ancestral vertebrate genome. Among mammals, the genome of the little brown bat Myotis lucifugus is notable for its relatively high and recently acquired number of inactive hAT transposons. The distribution of SPIN elements is patchy and does not relate well to known phylogenetic relationships, prompting suggestions that these elements may have spread through horizontal gene transfer. Domestication Transposons are said to be exapted or \\"domesticated\\" when they have acquired functional roles in the host genome. Several sequences evolutionarily related to the hAT family have been exapted in diverse organisms, including Homo sapiens. An example is the ZBED gene family, which encode a group of zinc finger-containing regulatory proteins.

The station was located at Dempster Street and Sherman Avenue, in Evanston, Illinois. It was adjacent to the Dempster Purple Line station. The station consisted of a pair of side platforms on the outside of the line's three tracks. Consistent with the C&NW;'s left-hand running, the eastern track and platform served southbound trains (to Chicago) while the western track and platform served northbound trains (to Milwaukee). The center track was a through track and did not serve the station. The entire facility was elevated above ground level on a solid fill embankment. Access to the platforms was available by a number of stairways on both sides of the crossing of Dempster. By the 1950s, Chicago and North Western management began to reassess its commuter service and determined that the railroad would be more economical and efficient by closing stations in and near Chicago and focusing on suburban and long-haul traffic while the Chicago Transit Authority could carry passengers in Chicago and its neighboring suburbs. To this end, the company went before the Illinois Commerce Commission in June 1958, requesting permission to abandon more than twenty stops, alter train schedules, revise its ticketing structure, and raise fares on monthly tickets. The ICC returned its verdict on November 14, ruling in favor of granting the majority of the Chicago and North Western's requests, which included the closure of the Dempster Street station. The fare increase and service alterations went into effect on December 1, 1958, and Dempster Street was abandoned along with twenty other stations either in or near Chicago on the Milwaukee, Galena, and Wisconsin Divisions.

Helena Blavatsky (Theosophist). Modern Theosophy is classified by prominent representatives of Western philosophy as a \\"pantheistic philosophical-religious system.\\" Russian philosopher Vladimir Trefilov claimed that Blavatsky's doctrine was formed from the beginning as a synthesis of philosophical views and religious forms of the various ages and peoples with modern scientific ideas. Michael Wakoff, an author of The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, stated that Blavatskian Theosophy was based on Buddhist and Hindu philosophy, and fragments of the Western esotericism with using an \\"absolutist metaphysics.\\" In The New Encyclopedia of Philosophy it is said that Blavatsky's Theosophy is an attempt to merge into a universal doctrine all religions by revealing their \\"common deep essence\\" and detection of \\"identity meanings of symbols,\\" all philosophies (including esoteric), and all sciences (including occult).  Philosophers about Theosophy  = One point of view = French philosopher Ren√© Gu√©non wrote that \\"the theories of the Theosophical Society are so strangely similar to those of Bergson that one may wonder whether they do not both derive from a common source.\\" He stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine is occupied by the \\"idea of evolution.\\" He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are > \\"seven 'mother-races' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', > that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each > 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven > 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through > seven globes in a 'round', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a > same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another > 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven > times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', > also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is > formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of > our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the > earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is > also the fourth of our 'planetary system'.\\" Concerning of the \\"so-called highly secret Tibetan texts\\" used by Blavatsky in writing her books The Secret Doctrine and The Voice of the Silence, Gu√©non stated that she has had a \\"translation of extracts from the Kandjur and Tandjur,\\" published in 1836 by Alexander Csoma de Koros. = Other point of view = Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova wrote that, in modern interpretations of the Theosophical doctrine, one can come across the concept of \\"philosophy of Theosophy.\\" In accordance with this logic, Theosophy should contain, in addition to philosophy, other aspects and manifestations. The specificity of Theosophy is \\"integrality of the theoretical & practical [approach], metaphysical & existential [points of view], transcendence & immanence, universal & particular, epistemology & ontology.\\" The Theosophical object of knowledge, as well as philosophical one, is \\"universal, essential, ultimate\\" one. But, according to Shabanova, [Western] philosophy, striving for the essential, although it allows in its space irrationality, mysticism, or intuitionism, rationally explains the features of the world picture. In Shabanova's opinion, the term \\"Theosophy\\" is often applied to the Theosophical teachings, which can be considered the \\"body of Theosophy.\\" It is necessary, she wrote, to distinguish, first, the transcendental basis of Theosophy as its \\"universal core,\\" secondly, Theosophy as a \\"state of consciousness,\\" and thirdly, Theosophy as a systematically formulated teaching. If \\"Divine wisdom\\" is the absolute Truth, then \\"the Theosophical doctrine\\" reflects the facets of this Truth, represented through \\"enlightened consciousness\\" and framed in certain knowledge and representations. Thus, the Theosophical teaching is not Truth, but only a \\"description\\" of it. To be proficient in the Theosophical knowledge does not yet mean reaching the \\"Theosophical state of consciousness,\\" because the accumulation of knowledge is not sufficient for the attainment of \\"Wisdom.\\" She claimed that the Theosophical teaching gets meaning through the self-realization of man, which is a \\"way of awakening the Divine wisdom.\\" Shabanova noted a \\"synthetic character\\" of the Theosophical teachings, which conditioned by the syncretic nature of the \\"transcendental nucleus\\" of Theosophy. For this reason, Theosophy can not be expressed in the form of an \\"ultimate doctrine,\\" and its various interpretations lead to contradictions both within the Theosophical Society and in external assessments. Blavatsky's definition of Theosophy is quoted in a book by Shabanova: > \\"Theosophy is... the archaic Wisdom-Religion, the esoteric doctrine once > known in every ancient country having claims to civilization. This 'Wisdom' > all the old writings show us as an emanation of the divine Principle; and > the clear comprehension of it is typified in such names as the Indian Budha, > the Babylonian Nebo, the Thoth of Memphis, the Hermes of Greece; in the > appellations, also, of some goddesses‚ÄîMetis, Neitha, Athena, the Gnostic > Sophia, and finally the Vedas, from the word 'to know.' Under this > designation, all the ancient philosophers of the East and West, the > Hierophants of old Egypt, the Rishis of Aryavarta, the Theodidaktoi of > Greece, included all knowledge of things occult and essentially divine.\\" Shabanova wrote that, according to Blavatsky, \\"Theosophy in its fruition is spiritual knowledge itself‚Äîthe very essence of philosophical and theistic enquiry.\\" And the genuine Theosophists should have faith in the intangible, omnipotent, omnipresent, and invisible Cause, which \\"is All, and Nothing; ubiquitous yet one; the Essence filling, binding, bounding, containing everything; contained in all.\\" In 1879, the originator of modern Theosophy first presented the statement on \\"a single Supreme Essence, Unknown and Unknowable\\" which was the \\"central idea of the Eclectic Theosophy.\\" This statement was later developed by Blavatsky in the proem to The Secret Doctrine, where it is said that there is \\"an Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless, and Immutable Principle on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude.\\"  Blavatsky about philosophy  = \\"Philosophers and Philosophicules\\" = Arnold Kalnitsky, a religious studies scholar, wrote that in Blavatsky's article \\"Philosophers and Philosophicules\\" it is about \\"the issues of philosophy from the Theosophical perspective.\\" The article's author believes that Theosophy deserves respect as a serious intellectual activity, basing on publicly voiced philosophical principles. According to Kalnitsky, to avoid confusion, she says Theosophy cannot be reduced to a single form of knowledge or intellectual activity, \\"Theosophy is certainly not a philosophy, simply because it includes every philosophy as every science and religion.\\" Kalnitsky wrote that the article author fully convinced that Theosophy should be \\"life blood\\" of philosophy, which is defined as \\"the science of things divine and human, and the causes in which they are contained.\\" Also she believes that only Theosophy has the \\"keys\\" to these causes. Blavatsky claims that philosophy was \\"crystallization point\\" of various forms of knowledge, and he quoted in this way: > \\"When applied to god or gods, it became in every country theology; when to > material nature, it was called physics and natural history; concerned with > man, it appeared as anthropology and psychology; and when raised to the > higher regions it becomes known as metaphysics. Such is philosophy‚Äî'the > science of effects by their causes'‚Äîthe very spirit of the doctrine of > Karma, the most important teaching under various names of every religious > philosophy, and a theosophical tenet that belongs to no one religion but > explains them all. Philosophy is also called 'the science of things > possible, inasmuch as they are possible'.\\" = Theosophy and Hegelianism = In Kalnitsky's opinion, in hers article Blavatsky trying apparently to get a \\"legitimation\\" her Theosophical ideas, arguing that they are not at variance with the views of Hegel on the essence of philosophy: > \\"Hegel regards it as 'the contemplation of the self-development of the > Absolute', or in other words as 'the representation of the Idea' (). The > whole of the Secret Doctrine‚Äîof which the work bearing that name is but an > atom‚Äîis such a contemplation and record, as far as finite language and > limited thought can record the processes of the Infinite.\\" Thus, according to Blavatsky, the Theosophical Secret Doctrine is the most complete and \\"mature\\" expression \\"of philosophical activity\\", which is carried out as \\"such a contemplation and record\\" of the Absolute. Kalnitsky wrote that, turning to the Hegelian theory and trying to find herein \\"substantial doctrinal parallels,\\" she aims to consolidate her philosophical authority. Hegel's system, like most other idealist trends in philosophy, gave many useful concepts Theosophists, but in most cases, the Theosophical views differed with them due to a number of distinctions in basic positions. In terms of Theosophists, philosophical activity was considered barren without occult and mystical assumptions, and intelligent searches have been justified only if they have provided evidence of their beliefs. Kalnitsky wrote that, defining \\"Theosophical speculation\\" as an act of true philosophy, Blavatsky states that the commonality of purposes eliminates traditional religious restrictions, \\"Thus it becomes evident that Theosophy cannot be a 'religion', still less 'a sect', but it is indeed the quintessence of the highest philosophy in all and every one of its aspects.\\" In his opinion, Blavatsky's statement that Theosophy is the \\"synthesis\\" and something \\"big\\" compared to any discipline or type of knowledge is inevitably present certain amount of linguistic confusion and contradictions. She claims that her Theosophy should be regarded as \\"the quintessence of the highest philosophy in all and every one of its aspects\\" and that it \\"cannot be a religion.\\" Trying to preserve the religious, philosophical and scientific tradition, she insists on prevailing over all synthetic and inclusive status of Theosophy, using a rhetorical technique, when a seems minor compared to the. Thus, Theosophy is not simply a religion, philosophy or science, but the more authoritative and reliable source that covers and synthesizes them. In this case, Theosophy seems \\"the quintessence of the highest philosophy.\\" He wrote that \\"continual irritation\\" of the article author against any attempt to interpret Theosophy as a privileged religion or sect, which is for her a challenge, requiring immediate transition to protection by the proclamation that Theosophy avoids dogmatism and aims to be inclusive. According to Kalnitsky, Blavatsky was sure that she was able to prove Theosophy can match with any definition of philosophy, and there is a general philosophical principles which the Theosophy does not contradict. She quotes William Hamilton, who said that philosophy is \\"a search for principles, sensible and abstract truths,\\" as well as the use of reason \\"to its legitimate objects.\\" She believes that Theosophy is completely legitimate and reliable means of achieving these goals, especially relating to the nature of \\"the Ego, or mental Self\\" and the relationship between \\"the ideal and the real.\\" That is why in theory she perceive Theosophy, albeit with some limitations, as the equivalent of philosophy. Blavatsky believes that \\"he who studies Theosophy, studies the highest transcendental philosophy.\\" In Kalnitsky's opinion, linking the Theosophical system with the tradition of philosophical reasoning, and assuming similar purposes, she trying to achieve for herself greater respectability and authority. = Versus unspiritual philosophism = At the end of hers article Blavatsky resorts to accusatory rhetoric, trying once again to show that Theosophy often is beyond the horizon of the people who might recognize it. Kalnitsky noted, \\"She compares her situation to that of Socrates,\\" claiming that if his teachings was would rejected because of the charges against him, then knowledge, which was transmitted through Plato and philosophers-neoplatonists would never came up to us. Blavatsky, again turning her attention to modern philosophical mood, contemptuously speaks of those, who engage in unspiritual philosophizing. Speaking about the \\"true philosophers,\\" she makes the following observation, and Kalnitsky quoted it: > \\"A sceptic can never aspire to that title. He who is capable of imagining > the universe with its handmaiden Nature fortuitous, and hatched like the > black hen of the fable, out of a self-created egg hanging in space, has > neither the power of thinking nor the spiritual faculty of perceiving > abstract truths; which power and faculty are the first requisites of a > philosophical mind. We see the entire realm of modern Science honeycombed > with such materialists, who yet claim to be regarded as philosophers. They > either believe in naught as do the Secularists, or doubt according to the > manner of the Agnostics.\\" Blavatsky believed that a priori assumption about the spiritual basis of reality determines the truth of any philosophy. Kalnitsky wrote that in the final part of hers article she \\"exalts\\" deductive reasoning of Plato, comparing it with inductive reasoning of modern thinkers: \\"None of our present Darwinians, and materialists and their admirers, our critics, could have studied philosophy otherwise than very 'superficially'. Hence while Theosophists have a legitimate right to the title of philosophers‚Äîtrue 'lovers of Wisdom'‚Äîtheir critics and slanderers are at best Philosophicules‚Äîthe progeny of modern Philosophism.\\"  Philosophers' criticism  ;Ren√© Gu√©non He called Blavatskian Theosophy a \\"theosophism\\" () and described it in his book as a \\"pseudo-religion.\\" He wrote that presented by the Theosophical Society's leaders assertion about the alleged the \\"Eastern origin\\" of their doctrine was false, and its initial tendency was overtly anti-Christian. According to him, between the doctrine of the Theosophical Society, or, at least, that ones was proclaimed and Theosophy in the true sense of the word, there is absolutely no affinity: > \\"It is after all only a confused mixture of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, Jewish > Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and occultism, the whole of it being gathered as well > as can be expressed around two or three ideas which, whether one likes it or > not, are of completely modern and purely Western origin.\\" In his opinion, the Theosophical conceptions of evolution \\"are basically only an absurd caricature of the Hindu theory of cosmic cycles.\\" He wrote that Theosophy \\"must be placed quite simply, along with spiritism and the different occultist schools to which it is obviously related, in the collection of bizarre productions of the contemporary mentality to which may be given the general name of 'neo-spiritualism.'\\" ;Vladimir Solovyov, and other A Russian philosopher Vladimir Solovyov wrote that the main theories and doctrines of the Theosophical Society \\"seem to us very shaky and vague.\\" Blavatsky created, he explained, a \\"pseudo-Theosophical\\" Society, because hers teaching \\"is untenable and false.\\" Thus, modern Theosophy is a doctrine not only \\"anti- religious\\" and \\"anti-scientific,\\" but also \\"antiphilosophic.\\" A religious philosopher Sergius Bulgakov stated that [Blavatskian] Theosophy, trying to replace religion with itself, turns into a \\"vulgar pseudoscientific mythology.\\" In Nikolai Berdyaev's opinion, \\"contemporary 'theosophical' movements\\" corrupted the beautiful word 'Theosophy' and \\"have made us forget\\" the existence of a genuine \\"Christian theosophy\\". He believed that modern Theosophy does not represent a synthesis of religion, philosophy and science, as its adherents say, but there is a \\"mixture\\" of them, in which there is no real religion, no real philosophy, no real science. Also besides he stated: > \\"It is difficult to find creative thinkers among the Theosophists. The > median level of the Theosophical books is not very high. Theosophists fight > independent thoughts and are little interested by the multiplicity of > creative processes, that occur outside their circle. The seclusive closed-in > circle is very characteristic for the Theosophical... setting.\\" A Russian philosopher Vladimir Lesevich, firmly believing philosophical ignorance of Blavatsky, tartly noted: > \\"What kind of audience they [the Theosophists] will snared, you can see from > the witty expose the charlatanical tricks of Mme Blavatsky, who began a > discuss the philosophy of Plato and talked a lot of all kinds of nonsense. > Exposing all this nonsense shows full justice to the characteristics of the > logical methods unscrupulous author of Isis Unveiled, who, appears, imagines > itself that if she said anything a three-fold, the sentence has to be > considered proven.\\" An employee of the Institute of philosophy Lydia Fesenkova also severely criticized the occult statements of Blavatsky, which described anthropogenesis, \\"From the point of view of science, such beliefs are an explicit profanity and don't have the right to exist in the serious literature.\\"  See also  * \\"Is Theosophy a Religion?\\" * The Key to Theosophy * Theosophy and Buddhism * Theosophy and Christianity * Theosophy and Hinduism * Theosophy and literature * \\"What Are The Theosophists?\\" * \\"What Is Theosophy?\\"  Notes   References  =Sources=      ;In Russian   *  External links  * Theosophy: History and contemporaneity.

It was the first Soviet, and later the first Russian 32-bit microprocessor system. From a programmer's point of view, it was a complete replica of the VAX 11/750 Comet and included floating point arithmetic, unlike the MicroVAX microprocessors produced by DEC. The chipset included a processor, a coprocessor for integer and floating-point arithmetic, a memory controller and a bus adapter. It was fabricated in a 3 ¬µm process. The Electronika-32 computer and a VAX-PC board were built based on this chipset, as well as the aerospace on-board digital computer SB3541 (developed by LNPOEA - OKB \\"Electroavtomatika\\", St. Petersburg). The 1839 chipset is still in production, and is used in the control systems of the GLONASS-M satellites. The processor had external microprogram control, that is, in addition to the CPU, a separate ROM was required (1839RE1 for special equipment or any 16kW 32-bit ROM with the appropriate cycle time). However, this does not mean that the instruction set could be modified arbitrarily since the instruction decoder was included in the circuitry of the CPU. According to posts on the FidoNet forum MO.DEC, the arithmetic coprocessor was originally released with errors, and it was not always possible to run software written for the VAX.

The statue was officially opened in 1971 and was the work of the Iraqi sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat. It has become one of Baghdad's most iconic public artworks.

Background From 1969 when Iraq became a republic and the Hashemite monarchy was overthrown (the monarchy was overthrown and Iraq become a republic in 1958), leading artists and sculptors were commissioned to produce artworks that would beautify the city of Baghdad, glorify Iraq's ancient past and contribute to a sense of national identity. During this period, sculptors including Khaled al-Rahal, Jawad Saleem and Mohammed Ghani Hikmat executed a number of high profile public monuments which are now dotted around the city of Baghdad. al-Kalil, S., Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq.

His works achieved popularity because they depicted scenes from the everyday life of Baghdad's people and also drew on Iraqi folklore.Floyd, T., \\"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat,\\" [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: Many of Ghani's early sculptures were inspired by Iraqi folklore, especially characters from One Thousand and One Nights (widely known as the Tales of Arabian Nights). His early works were figurative and included statues of Sinbad, the Sailor; the 10th-century poet, Al-Mutanabbi; the first Abassid Caliph, Abu-Ja'afar Mansur (in stone); Hammurabi (in bronze) and Gilgamesh.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 72 As Ghani matured, his work became increasingly abstract, but he never lost sight of the need to reference Iraq's ancient art traditions through the use of Arabic script, geometric designs, and Sumerian architectural features.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, pp 73-75 His most well-known works include a pair of statues of Queen Scheherazade and King Shahryar, located on the banks of the Tigris River, near Abu Nuwas Street and the Fountain of Kahramana in the central business district.Schmidt, M.S., \\"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82\\", New York Times, 21 September, 2011, Online:; \\"Artist and Sculptor Mohamed Ghani Hikmat\\", Al Jazeera News 15 September, 2011, Online: Description Built in the late 1960s and inaugurated in 1971, the fountain was inspired by the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves from One Thousand and One Nights and the slave girl, Marjana (or Morgiana), who outwitted the thieves. The story relates how the slave girl persuaded thieves, who had come to attack her master, to hide in storage jars. She then pours boiling oil into the jars to kill the thieves. As a mark of his gratitude, Ali Baba grants Marjana her freedom and she ultimately marries Ali Baba's son.

The fountain depicts the slave girl standing over 40 jars, ready to pour the hot oil. It was cast in bronze, stands 3.3 metres in height and is situated in Kahramana Square, Sa'adoon Street, Baghdad. As the girl pours the water, a series of lilting fountains cascades downward towards the base of the statue.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 74 and p.42; Shabout, N., \\"Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism,\\" in Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online The cascading water contributed to the monument's grandeur, but the water was turned off during the Iran-Iraq war and the fountain fell into a state of disrepair, with overgrown verges and the base of the fountain filled with litter.

It was built from 1834 to 1850 by Edward Davies. It is also known as Commercial Bank of Australia, Rosebank, Oldbury's Inn, Holsberry Inn, Mail Coach Inn, and Royal Mail Coach Inn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Berrima is the second oldest (European) settlement in Wingecarribee Shire and the oldest continuing settlement in the shire. The first town settlement in the district was in 1821 at Bong Bong, 8 km south-east of Berrima on the Wingecarribee River. The site of Berrima was selected by Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1829 on a visit planning the route for a new road alignment from Sydney to replace the old Argyle Road, which had proven unsatisfactory due to a steep hill climb over the Mittagong Range and river crossing at Bong Bong. In 1830 Mitchell instructed Robert Hoddle to mark out the town based on a plan Mitchell's office prepared, along the lines of a traditional English village (with a central market place and as many blocks as possible facing onto the Wingecarribee River), and using the local Aboriginal name. The new line of road came through the town. Berrima was to be established as the commercial and administrative centre for the County of Camden. Following the approval of Governor Bourke in 1831, the period 1824 to 1841 saw significant flourishing development as mail coaches changed their route to this new line of road. Early town lots were sold in 1833, predominantly to inn keepers and around Market Square, including the first town lot sales to Bryan McMahon. Governor Bourke designated Berrima as a place for a courthouse and gaol to serve the southern part of the state. With construction of the jail from 1835 to 1839 and its courthouse in 1838 to serve the southern part of the state, the town flourished into the 1840s as mail coaches called, public buildings including churches were built in 1849 and 1851, and many hotels and coaching houses were established to serve local resident needs and passing trades, persons and commercial travellers. Its 1841 population was 249 with 37 houses completed and 7 more in construction. Research has indicated there were some 13 hotels or grog houses in Berrima at the one time in the early days before the coming of the Southern Railway to the Moss Vale area, which by-passed Berrima. Michael Doyle and his wife operated the Mail Coach Inn at 22 Jellore Street from 1837 to 1839 as a licensed public house and staging post for travel and the delivery of mail. It was one of the first inns to operate in Berrima. In April 1838 the Doyles purchased Lots 2, 3 and 4 Section 1 and Lot 3 Section 4 (now known as the White Horse Inn) to expand their business including providing more accommodation for travellers and taking on the mail delivery service. In 1839 permission was granted to Doyle of the Mail Coach Inn (on Lot 2 Section 1, now called the Coach & Horses Inn, Jellore Street) to transfer his liquor licence to the opposite side of Market Square in 1839 to operate from the property he and his wife had purchased, the site now known as the White Horse Inn. By the 1840s there were four licensed premises including the Berrima Inn, Surveyor General Inn, Mail Coach Inn and Crown Inn. Prior to the coming of the railway to the Moss Vale area, there were 13 hotels in Berrima. The first licensed inn for Berrima was the Berrima Inn, operated by Bryan McMahon, in 1834. Seven of the early hotel buildings remain today with the oldest (surviving) being the Surveyor General Inn, its first licence granted to James Harper on 29/6/1835. The Breen family, who later bought McMahon's Inn and the Coach & Horses Inn (unlicensed), were involved with two other hotels. It is understood that the original stone Georgian inn was constructed between 1834 and 1850 during ownership of Edward Davies. It later became known as 'Oldbury's Inn' during the ownership of Ben Marshall Osborne. The building operated as a coaching inn in its early years and its original underground cellars were often used for the housing of convicts during their conscription to labour at Berrima Bridge and Berrima Gaol. In the early 1850s, a high pitched gabled roofed structure in Victorian Gothic revival style was added to the west of the 1834 building. Also at this time a two storey stone store room was added to the rear of the original building. The 1851 census showed the number of buildings remained the same but the population had dropped to 192. During the 1850s Berrima experienced another boom period after the discovery of gold. When the Great Southern Railway bypassed Berrima in 1867 the town again began to decline as Mittagong, Moss Vale and Bowral developed. Berrima remained virtually unchanged for the next 100 years, preserving the town as an almost intact colonial village. It is uncertain when the building was renamed the White Horse Inn. During its life the building has been used as a Commercial Bank of Australia as well as a private home known as Rosebank. The historic building operated as a restaurant and accommodation inn over many decades, later with separate motel accommodation. The earlier freestanding coach house has been utilised for other commercial uses over time and was later used as part of the motel operations. In 1979 the coach house was substantially damaged by fire and was subsequently reconstructed and restored. In 2013, the building was purchased by Reg Grundy and Joy Chambers.  Description  =Site= The setting of the White Horse Inn sets it apart from the Coach & Horses Inn (former) and the Berrima Inn (former) opposite. The two storey White Horse Inn sits prominently on the rise above the Old Hume Highway with high exposure to passing traffic. This constributes significantly to the aesthetic appreciation by the casual observer of the Berrima village and the predominantly Colonial/Victorian Georgian architecture of the village.Webb, 2008, 35 The site comprises an irregular shaped allotment approximately 5,914 metres in area that has frontage to Market Place and to the Wingecarribee River. Existing on the site are the White Horse Inn - a sandstone s building and barn, stone coach house, s motel and fibro outbuildings. The site is traversed approximately half way down its length by a sewer main and the one in hundred year flood frequency level contour. The site is visible from the Berrima Market Place, the bridge over the Hume Highway and the opposite bank of the Wingecarribee River. =Inn (1834, extended 1850s and 1970s)= The inn is a large, two storey building with sandstone block walls and a corrugated iron roof. It has a two storey timber verandah on the street frontage. The facade is formally coursed sandstone with well-proportioned windows and doors typical of the Georgian/Regency architectural style. It generally has a high level of architectural detail. =Coach House (1865; rebuilt/restored 1979)= To the south east of the Inn is the \\"coach house\\", a similarly constructed building to the inn. =Motel= Behind both Inn and Coach House, c.40m from the frontage, is a 1980s single storey four room motel in fibro and brick with a tile roof.  Heritage listing  The White Horse Inn is significant because it retains the evidence of the period of the early settlement of Berrima when convicts were locked in its cellar at night. It has associations with important phases in the foundation and growth of Berrima because of its various uses over time to the present day and in particular, its use as a coaching inn and traveller's hotel. It is a sizable and well detailed early building which shows the prosperity and early pretensions to style. Much important early fabric remains and the essential original form of its Georgian styling is relatively intact. It is also valued by the community as a prominent building in the Marketplace contributing to the historic character of Berrima. White Horse Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

She praised the chemistry between Virk and Bajwa, performances of all characters; in last added, ‚ÄúNegative aspects are that the Twists and Turns shown in the film are not very factful which came out to give an unimpactful ending. Technical aspects are good as Direction has binded the story and others aspects like Cinematography, Editing, Art Direction all are also done well. Music of Muklawa is good as all the songs are very entertaining but Kala Suit song is not the film.

It was designed by Augustus Pugin and built from 1849 to 1851 by William Munro. Originally known as St. Scholastica's Church, it is used by the Parish of St. Paul, administered by the Pauline Fathers, and located in the Diocese of Wollongong. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 January 2008.  History  Berrima is the second oldest European settlement in Wingecarribee Shire and the oldest continuing settlement in the shire. The first town settlement in the district was in 1821 at Bong Bong, 8km south-east of Berrima on the Wingecarribee River. The site of Berrima was selected by Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1829 on a visit planning the route for a new road alignment from Sydney to replace the old Argyle Road, which had proven unsatisfactory due to a steep hill climb over the Mittagong Range and river crossing at Bong Bong. In 1830 Mitchell instructed Robert Hoddle to mark out the town based on a plan Mitchell's office prepared, along the lines of a traditional English village (with a central market place and as many blocks as possible facing onto the Wingecarribee River), and using the local Aboriginal name. The new line of road came through the town. Berrima was to be established as the commercial and administrative centre for the County of Camden. Following the approval of Governor Bourke in 1831, the period 1824 to 1841 saw significant flourishing development as mail coaches changed their route to this new line of road. Early town lots were sold in 1833, predominantly to inn keepers and around Market Square, including the first town Lot sales to Bryan McMahon. Governor Bourke designated Berrima as a place for a courthouse and gaol to serve the southern part of the state. With construction of the gaol from 1835 to 1839 and its courthouse in 1838 to serve the southern part of the state, the town flourished into the 1840s as mail coaches called, public buildings, including churches in 1849 and 1851, establishment of many hotels and coaching houses to service local resident needs and passing trades, persons and commercial travellers. Its 1841 population was 249 with 37 houses completed and 7 more in construction. Research has indicated there were some 13 hotels or grog houses in Berrima at the one time in the early days before the coming of the Southern Railway to the Moss Vale area, which by-passed Berrima. During his 1841/1842 trip to England, John Bede Polding OSB, first Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, was exposed to the impact of the revolutionary new Gothic Revival works by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. He attended the dedication of Pugin's St Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham, England, in June 1841 and subsequently consecrated Robert Willson there in October 1842 as first Catholic Bishop of Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land. Polding also saw Pugin's ambitious design for a vast new monastery for his former Benedictine monastic brethren at Downside Priory, Somerset. As a consequence Polding sought designs from Pugin for a range of buildings and these were despatched in December 1842. The package of designs included a temporary free-standing bell tower for St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, along with major extensions destined to ultimately replace that building, a school and at least five designs for churches, from small two- compartment structures to a large spired triple-gabled building. All differed from any of Pugin's existing English or Irish designs. Although the bell tower and cathedral are no more, Pugin's extant school (St Mary's Cathedral Chapter House) and four churches in Sydney (Ryde, Balmain, Broadway and Parramatta), although all substantially altered, represent the greatest number of Pugin buildings in any city, town or village anywhere in the world. From 1840 the Catholic community in the Berrima district had been worshipping in a chapel converted from two huts formerly used to house chain gangs. In 1846, Dean John Grant of the Campbelltown mission determined to erect a permanent church in Berrima, and as a result Polding supplied him with a set of Pugin's plans for a small two-compartment church. Polding came down to Berrima to bless and lay the foundation stone in mid-1847, but work on the building's erection did not commence for another two years, with William Munro as builder. Munro would appear to have started the job upon completion of Edmund Blacket's Holy Trinity Anglican Church (1847‚Äì1849) in the same village. Research by historian Linda Emery reveals that the major local contributor, promising 20 pounds, was publican Bryan McMahon, owner of the Berrima Inn in Jellore Street. A former soldier transported to New South Wales for desertion, he came to Berrima as the overseer of one of the convict road gangs working in the district. Recognising the potential of the growing market town, he left his government position in the mid-1830s and built Berrima's first licensed inn. The other major contributors to the building fund were also publicans ‚Äì Michael Doyle of Berrima, Redmond Connor of Sutton Forest and John Keighran from Bargo. Builder William Munro was finishing the construction of Berrima's Holy Trinity Anglican Church when he secured the contract in 1849 to build St. Scholastica's. A Scottish immigrant, he had arrived in the colony in 1838 and began his working life in New South Wales as a house carpenter. His work in Berrima, also including major repairs to Berrima Court House, set him on the path to success and he became a leading Sydney architect.Berrima District News, 2015 St. Scholastica's stands on the site of the Berrima stockade, where the road gangs that worked on construction of the Great South Road were housed. When the gangs left Berrima in 1838, the Catholic chaplain of New South Wales, Father John McEncroe, applied to the Government of New South Wales for the land on which to build a church and a school. The first mass was celebrated in 1840 and later that year the foundation stone was laid. The building of a more permanent church was first mooted in 1840 and a subscription list opened, but it was 9 years before construction began. Builder William Munro was just finishing Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Berrima when he secured the contract to build the new Catholic church. In February 1849 Archbishop Polding laid the foundation stone in the presence of some 150 local residents. The stone came from the same quarry used for building Holy Trinity. Pugin expert Brian Andrews, in an essay on the Pugin Foundation website, points out that the design of St. Scholastica's was a totally original evocation of a small English medieval village church. He also states that the quality of workmanship in the church reveals that Munro was a very competent builder.(Southern Highland News, 2015) St. Scholastica's was for many years the focus of Catholic worship in the district, but as the railway towns of Mittagong, Bowral and Moss Vale developed, Berrima declined. In the late 1880s the Berrima Church was incorporated into the Moss Vale parish and the name changed to St. Francis Xavier.Southern Highland News, 28/9/2015 The building has remained substantially intact, apart from some ceiling additions in 1988‚Äì1993, and still reflects Pugin's exacting standards of proportion. Except for a short period from 1973 to 1984 when the building was closed, it has always functioned as a Catholic church. In 1984 it was reopened and since 2000 has been substantially repaired. It is open for mass, weddings and other sacraments through the Moss Vale Parish. A dedicated \\"Friends of the Church\\" group manages the ongoing restoration and maintenance of this local heritage treasure.Southern Highland News, 2015  Description  Designed in 1842 in an Early English Gothic idiom of around the mid-thirteenth century, the church consists of: a four-bay nave, buttressed at the corners, with north porch and a single bellcote astride the west gable; a two-bay chancel with diagonal buttressing to its east wall; and a sacristy abutting the chancel south wall. It is constructed of ashlar sandstone and has corrugated iron roofs. The nave and porch interiors are of ashlar sandstone, the chancel and sacristy being plastered. The nave has an open timber roof with arch-braced collar tie trusses having arch-braced king posts. The chancel has a plaster ceiling dating from the last quarter of the twentieth century. The floors are wooden. The chancel is equipped with stone sedilia and piscina as well as an Easter sepulchre recess. Rougher finish to the stonework of the nave east wall interior above the level of the north and south walls indicates that the surface was designed to receive a Doom painting. With the exception of the chancel, porch and sacristy ceilings and the corrugated iron roofs, the entire structure is original and intact and unaltered. The present forward altar is original, as is the baptismal font (not by Pugin), all other furnishings dating from not earlier than the last decade of the nineteenth century. The church is sited on an open block with large mature European, Californian (Monterey pine, Pinus radiata) and native trees around its perimeter and some small shrubs and trees on the block. It was reported as being generally in very good condition as at 15 June 2006. This is Pugin's only intact and essentially unaltered building in Australia. In its layout and permanent liturgical furnishings: piscina, sedilia, Easter sepulchre recess, provision for a Doom painting (the designed rood screen appears not to have been erected)-it is a comprehensive expression of his ideal for the revival of a small English medieval village church. It is one of only two such intact churches of Pugin's with this typology and these furnishings worldwide, the other being Our Lady and St Wilfrid's Church, Warwick Bridge, Cumbria. It is the only Australian church with an Easter sepulchre recess and provision for a Doom painting. = Modifications and dates = * Last quarter of 20th century: New plaster ceiling to chancel. Reversible. * 1991: Disabled ramp to north porch, along with re-orientation of porch approach steps. Reversible. * 1988-1993: Replacement of ceiling in sacristy. Reversible. * 1988-1993: Pine board ceiling to porch. Reversible.  Heritage listing  St Francis Xavier's, Berrima, is of state significance as the only intact and essentially unaltered Pugin-designed building in New South Wales, indeed in the whole of Australia. With his complete set of liturgical furnishings (excepting the rood screen which may not have been constructed) and in a scholarly mid thirteenth- century Early English Gothic idiom, beyond the compass of New South Wales architects at the time of its design in 1842, it is his perfect exemplar for the re-creation of a small English medieval village church. Pugin is acknowledged to be England's greatest and most influential early-Victorian designer and theorist. The building is one of only two such Pugin churches of its particular typology and with these liturgical furnishings in the world, the other being Our Lady and St Wilfrid's, Warwick Bridge, Cumbria, England. The building is associated with John Bede Polding, first Catholic bishop in Australia, later first Archbishop of Sydney and founder of the Australian Catholic hierarchy, who supplied the plans that he had acquired from Pugin in 1842. As such it clearly demonstrates Polding's evolving taste in church architecture. St Francis Xavier's Roman Catholic Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 January 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. St Francis Xavier's Church is of state significance as a comprehensive demonstration of its designer Pugin's ideals and theories as embodied in his writings. As the acknowledged father of the Gothic Revival his publications had a profound impact on the course of nineteenth-century design, particularly as applied to church architecture and furnishings. This impact is evident in the pattern across New South Wales towns and cities where the overwhelming bulk of church designs from the 1840s were in a Gothic idiom resulting from the powerful message of Pugin's equation of Gothic with Christian. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. St Francis Xavier's is of state significance for its association with John Bede Polding OSB (1794-1877), the pioneering Catholic bishop in Australia and, from 1842, Archbishop of Sydney and founder of the Australian Catholic hierarchy. The Pugin design for the Berrima church was supplied by Archbishop Polding, one of a set of designs that he had obtained from Pugin in late 1842, and it reflects his maturing views on the nature and purpose of church architecture. It is also of star significance for its association with Pugin who was a key figure in the establishment of the Victorian Gothic Revival style for church buildings throughout the British Empire. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. St Francis Xavier's, Berrima, has the ability to demonstrate the creative brilliance of Pugin, England's greatest and most influential early-Victorian designer and theorist. The building, being intact and with his designed liturgical furnishings (except for its rood screen which may never have been constructed), fully exemplifies his ideal for the re-creation of a small English medieval village church. Its fidelity to the Early English idiom of the middle of the thirteenth century was, at the time of its design in 1842, well beyond the compass of any architect in the Colony of New South Wales. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Except for a short period from 1973 to 1984 when the building was closed it has always functioned as a Catholic church. It is highly esteemed by architectural historians as 'a near-perfect exemplar of Pugin's concept for the revival of a small medieval country church.' More general community esteem would be enhanced by increased awareness of the building's significance, following SHR listing. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As the only intact and essentially unaltered Pugin building in New South Wales, indeed, in the whole of Australia, St Francis Xavier's has the potential to serve as a valuable educational resource for students of the built environment, of the Gothic Revival style in New South Wales and of the establishment of the Catholic church in New South Wales, particularly prior to the episcopacy of Cardinal Moran in the late 19th century. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. St Francis Xavier's, Berrima, is rare as the only intact and essentially unaltered Pugin building in New South Wales, indeed, in the whole of Australia. It is the only Australian church with an Easter sepulchre recess and with provision for a Doom painting. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This church is a paradigm of Pugin's influential views that came to dominate church architecture. This impact is evident across New South Wales towns and cities where the overwhelming bulk of church designs from the 1840s were in a Gothic idiom resulting from the powerful message of Pugin's equation of Gothic with Christian.

Shirvan was the largest silk farming region there. The population in Shamakhi, Basqal, Ganja, Shaki and Shusha engaged in silk production. Patterned, ornamental silk female kerchiefs were produced in these regions. Silk production was one of the main activities continued into modern times.  Shirvan  The silk produced in Shirvan was known in countries such as Russia and Western Europe by the 11th century. At that time, silk was exported to Russia, Iraq, Syria and other countries from Shamakhi. Shirvan maintained its dominance in silk production in the Near East in the 16th and 17th centuries. Most Shirvan silk is exported. Most the rest was used for silk weaving. Adam Olearius visited Azerbaijan in the 17th century and wrote that 10-20 thousand packs (each pack was approximately 5,5 pounds) of raw materials were collected per year. 3000 packs belonged to Shirvan, 2000 belonged to Garabagh. It means 16,5 thousands pounds of raw material were produced in Shirvan, but 11 thousand pounds in Garabagh.  Shaki  Archeological investigations carried out in Shaki proved that silk production was the primary ancient household activity there. Development of silk production connected this city to the silk road caravan routes. A silk plant began to operate in 1931 in Shaki, which became one of the silk industry enterprises in the former USSR. In the 1970-1980s, 5-6 thousands tons of wet cocoon and 350-400 tons of raw silk was produced, supplying silk textile in 10 of million square meters. More than 150 thousand families were engaged in feeding and cocoon production. At that time, more than 14,000 people worked in the silk industry. 7,000 more were permanent employees of ‚ÄúShaki-Silk‚Äù plant. Azerbaijan was in the second place for cocoon production in the former Soviet Union after Uzbekistan, but was first for the quality of the produced silk. The ‚ÄúShaki-Silk‚Äù plant used to send textiles to 75 enterprises in the USSR, as well as silk thread to 84 enterprises. Textiles made from Shaki silk were exported to Japan, Switzerland, Italy and other countries. At the beginning of the 1990s, a recession was observed hit the silk industry. As a result, economic relations established over many years were lost. During these years, 2 silk producing stations, 7 cocoon seed plants, nearly 30 cocoon drying rooms, about 80 points for cocoon primary processing, as well as company ‚ÄúShaki-Silk‚Äù, Ordubad spinning mill stopped production. 10s of thousands of people lost work. The 1500 year-old Azerbaijan silking industry was in danger of destruction. ‚ÄúParvana‚Äù LLC was the winner of an investment competition for \\"Shaki-Silk‚Äù. It organized a development program to expand production and develop silkworm breeding. Production workshops were reconstructed, new technologies were applied to production, additional facilities and tools were installed. To improve the quality of the product, reconstruction was carried out in 2008. 4 spinning mills produced in China, 4 silk winders, new tools and vacuum apparatus were installed. After reconstruction labour productivity increased 6-7 times and production power 2,5 times. In the same year, new production area ‚Äì cotton spinning workshop with the 1740 tons of power launched its production. As a result of the activities, the number of employees in the company increased to 1500.  Kelaghayi  The most popular silk product in Azerbaijan is the women's silk scarf, called Kelaghayi. Kelaghayi is mainly produced in Sheki and Basqal. In 2014, Kelaghayi was included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List in Azerbaijan.

The participants in this game are called \\"Bali\\". In the regional language of Chittagong, it is known as Bali khela. Etymology \\"Boli\\" means wrestler or a powerful person in Bengali, while \\"Khela\\" denotes a game or play. So, Boli Khela means game of the powerful person. History About 250-300 years ago, Yasin Makki, who came from Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to spread Islam, started living in the hilly area of Madarsha in Satkania Upazila, Chittagong. From then on the area became known as Mokkarbari. Yasin started some business in the area as well as preaching. During the Hajj season, he used to take many Bangladeshi Haji to Saudi Arabia for Hajj. At one time he started living permanently in the Madarsha area of Satkania. Apart from Satkania, he bought a large amount of land in different parts of Chittagong. Yasin Makki went to Saudi Arabia with some Haji from Bangladesh during the Hajj season and died there. Then his next generation introduced the zamindari system. Later, Yasin Makki's grandson, Kader Bokshu, first introduced the game in 1889 to give pleasure to his subjects while collecting rent, and after his death it became known as the Mokkar Bali Khela. At the beginning of the game, he used to put a giant tree in front of the house. Those who came to pay the rent and those who could lift the tree from among the locals were considered only suitable for playing game. The main competition was played among those who were qualified to pick up pieces of trees, and prizes were given to the winners. Boishakhi fairs are also organized in the vicinity of a few kilometers around the game. Rules The arena measures 20 feet in diameter, and can be a circle or square in shape. It is played on a dirt or sand floor. The event starts at afternoon in a festive mood with the music of 'Dabor' (one kind of folk drum) and 'Sanai' (folk flute). Each match lasts about 25‚Äì30 minutes, but if both competitors agree, the length of the final match may be extended up to 10‚Äì15 minutes.

Before becoming governor, he was a member of the People's Representative Council representing the province. A three-term parliamentarian representing his home province, he had studied at Bandung Institute of Technology and Jakarta State University before becoming a lecturer and eventually joining PDI-P. Background He was born in the town of Singaraja on 20 October 1962. He completed his first twelve years of education there, graduating highschool in 1981. Afterwards, he moved to Bandung to study at Bandung Institute of Technology, from where he graduated in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Later on, he received a masters from the International Golden Institute (1995) and a doctorate from Jakarta State University (1999). Career After gaining his bachelors, he worked at the Ministry of Education and Culture as a researcher between 1988 and 1995. He then became a non-permanent lecturer at Tarumanegara University, Pelita Harapan University, Jakarta State University and an economic institute. =Parliament= By 2003, he was specialist staff in PDI-P. In 2004, he ran for a seat in the People's Representative Council as part of PDI-P. During the campaigning process, he headed a committee of a rally supporting the party in his hometown. Participants of the rally clashed with that of another rally supporting Golkar, resulting in two deaths from the latter group. Koster received a civil suit due to his position. Regardless, Koster secured a seat in the parliament after the 2004 election, and was sworn in on 1 October that year. After being reelected in 2009 with 185,901 votes, Koster was investigated by the Corruption Eradication Commission several times during his second term. He was questioned in 2011 regarding a case in the education ministry, in 2013 regarding another case related to the National Sports Week, and in 2014 about the cases of Akil Mochtar and the Hambalang sports complex. He was reelected for a third term in 2014, winning 260,342 votes. This was the most votes for Bali candidates and third-most votes won by a parliamentary candidate nationally, after fellow PDI-P members Karolin Margret Natasa and Puan Maharani. During most of his time in the parliament, Koster was part of the tenth commission covering education, culture, sports, tourism and creative economy. He had voiced an opposition against a 2014 law which would alter the selection of the parliamentary speaker from appointment by the largest party in an election to that of a parliamentary vote. He also voiced his support for a law which would allow Balinese villages to pick between being a \\"cultural village\\" or a standard village. He was eventually retasked to the fifth commission on public works, transportation and rural development. =Governor of Bali= In 2018, he ran in the gubernatorial elections for Bali, resigning from his parliament seat in order to do so. Running with Tjok Oka Artha Ardhana Sukawati, the pair won with 57.68 percent of the votes. He was sworn in on 5 September 2018. During the campaigning period, he stated that he wished to alter the family planning program in Bali by changing the recommended number of children from two to four in order to fit Balinese traditions. He announced to ban plastic, as stipulated in Gubernatorial Regulation (Pergub) No. 97/2018, expressing hope that the policy would lead to a 70 percent decline in Bali's marine plastics within a year.

The food on the plate is called Uchchhishta (noun). The plate is said to be Uchchhishta (adjective). Uchchhishta (, Ucchi·π£·π≠a), known by various regional terms, is an Indian and a Hindu concept related to food. Though the term has various meanings and has no exact parallel in English,Roy p. 107 it is generally translated in English as \\"leftovers\\"Olivelle pp. 354-5 or \\"leavings\\",Khare p. 79 but with a denigratory aspect. Uchchhishta frequently denotes food scraps after a person has eaten. In a broader sense, it refers to the contamination by food or hand that has come in contact with saliva or the inside of someone's mouth. A person or plate is also said to be Uchchhishta, when he/it comes in contact with Uchchhishta food. Uchchhishta food as well as the Uchchhishta eater/utensil are considered ritually impure. The eater is purified by washing his hand (Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers) and mouth. It is highly disrespectful to offer Uchchhishta to someone in general, however it is acceptable to eat Uchchhishta of socially superior individuals, among other exceptions. While an offering of Uchchhishta food or by a person in the Uchchhishta state to Hindu divinities is forbidden in classical Hinduism, some heterodox Tantric deities are worshipped with the taboo offering. Concept Leftovers of an Indian curry on a plate. The leftovers are called Uchchhishta (noun); the plate is described as Uchchhishta (adjective) The Monier-Williams Sanskrit dictionary defines Uchchhishta as: \\"left, rejected, stale, spit out of the mouth (as remnants of food); one who has still the remains of food in the mouth or hands, one who has not washed his hands and mouth and therefore is considered impure, impure; leavings, fragments, remainder (especially of a sacrifice or of food)\\". Medhatithi (c. 850‚Äì1050 CE), one of the oldest and most famous commentators of the Hindu law book Manusmriti lists the meanings of Uchchhishta: * Primary meaning: contamination by food or hand that has come in contact the inside of someone's mouth * Pollution due to contact with \\"the eater, the eaten food\\" or the plate on which someone has eaten * leftover food on someone's plate, after he has eaten * leftover food in the serving vessel after everyone is served * a person who has passed human waste, before purification While Uchchhishta is related to leftovers and contact with saliva, Uchchhishta should be differentiated from other terms also translated in English as \\"impure\\": Amedhya (\\"unfit for sacrifice\\") refers to contamination by contact to human waste, corpses, decomposition etc. and malina (\\"stained\\") refers to pollution by physical dirt.Olivelle & Davis Jr, p. 220 Like other bodily substances like sweat, saliva is considered to be part of body and also not part of it, that is, of \\"uncertain status\\". Thus, contact with saliva, Uchchhishta, is regarded as impure.Smith p. 154 The Manusmriti however does not regard saliva defiling in general, but only in the food context. Drops of saliva, which transmit from one person to another while speaking, are not treated impure.Olivelle & Davis Jr, p. 225 The precept of not contaminating all the food or a drink with bacteria or viruses in one's saliva is of particular concern as the health of someone could be threatened through cross contamination.Gadia p. 6 A medieval Siddhar mocks the concept of Uchchhishta. He questions how are the flowers offered to Hindu deities or honey not defiled by saliva of bees and the cow's milk by the saliva of the calf.Dundes p. 109  Regional names  *Jutha or Jhutha ‚Äì Hindi,Fuller p. 77 Bengali *Ushta ‚Äì Marathi; the term is used in the extended meaning of \\"used or enjoyed by others\\" e.g. a speech is described as ushta,if it is a plagiarism. *Enjalu (\\"saliva\\") ‚Äì KannadaKhare p. 226 *Engili ‚Äì Telugu *Eccil ‚Äì Tamil *Eccam ‚Äì Malayalam *Aintha ‚Äì Odia *\\"Etho\\" - Bengali *Made - Tulu Rules Uchchhista is generally regarded as highly polluting and impure in Hinduism. Hindus view Uchchhista with revulsion.Dundes p. 111 Eating Uchchhista is considered as humiliating; a Kannada proverb says that he is a dog who eats Uchchhista. Offering Uchchhista to a higher caste member is considered as his insult.Dundes p. 110 People usually do not dip, serve or accept food with the fingers or cutlery that has touched someone's mouth. While cooking also, the cook does not taste food and use the same utensil to stir the food. Once food is tasted with a utensil, it is put away to wash. Food which has been dipped with fingers and cutlery used for eating is considered Uchchhista. While sharing or eating dry food or fruits, the food is portioned so that it does not become contaminated by someone's saliva. For the same reason, Hindus do not generally drink from each other's water glasses.Dundes p. 108 In the early 20th century, use of spoons or forks and metal plates were not used by orthodox Hindus as they had come in contact with one's mouth and thus could not be reused as they remained Uchchhista, even though cleaned. One-use leaf plates were preferred; Hindus traditionally eat with their fingers, without cutlery.Dundes pp. 110‚Äì1 Uchchhishta is acceptable to be eaten by socially inferior individuals: one's servants, lower caste persons, beggars and animals.Khare p. 234 \\"Untouchables\\" including Castes handling human waste historically used to live on leftovers. Eating someone's Uchchhista is seen as a sign of submission and acceptance of the person's superiority. In modern India, the rules of Uchchhista are relaxed in the cases of intimacy of a couple or a family. Eating the Uchchhishta food of a young child by his parents is also acceptable, as the child is not regarded a fully-grown separate individual. Parents usually feed young children from their own plate. In contrast of the general negative connotations associated with it, eating some types of Uchchhista like of a husband by a wife, of a guru by the student and of a sacrifice or divine offering by all, is highly regarded. Prasad, food offered to a deity and having \\"eaten\\" by the deity, is sometimes considered the Uchchhista of the gods, as in some parts of North India; however other times as in parts of South India, the comparison of the sacred prasad to Uchchhista, is frowned upon.Olivelle & Davis Jr, pp. 439‚Äì40 A husband is considered equivalent to God for a Hindu wife. As such, wife can eat his Uchchhista as a sign of her love and submission. The wife may eat in the same leaf as the husband's, after he finishes. The husband will leave some food in his plate for her to eat, as a symbol of his love. The custom is ritually performed first at the time of marriage. This act is said to signify her integration in her new family. It is also acceptable if the wife eats the Uchchhista of her in-laws or her husband's brothers. A student bows to his guru. The student is prescribed to eat the guru's Uchchhishta, which is described variously as sacred and medicinal. The Apastamba Dharmasutra (1st- millennium BCE), while describing the code of conduct for a student, refers to the concept of Uchchhishta. In ancient times, a student would stay with a teacher (guru) in the latter's house (Gurukula) and learn. In this period, a student should ask for alms for his livelihood, which he should not consider as Uchchhishta. A student is prescribed to not leave any food uneaten in his plate, that is, leave no Uchchhishta. However, if any Uchchhishta remains, he should bury it, throw it in the water or give it away to a Shudra (a member from the lower social strata). The student is prescribed to eat the Uchchhishta of his guru, which are regarded as sacred as a sacrificial oblation. Eating Uchchhishta of one's father or brother is also acceptable.Olivelle pp. 11-2 The Vasishtha Dharmasutra regards the Uchchhista of the guru, equivalent to medicine that an ill student should have.Olivelle pp. 311 In the Guru Stotram, it is said that the Guru is equivalent to the Trimurti, hence, for the student, it is considered as taking prasadam. Exceptions to Uchchhishta are given in the Vasishtha Dharmasutra. Food remnants stuck in teeth or food currently in the mouth are not considered impure, as they are treated part of the mouth like teeth. Swallowing the same cleanses the individual. While pouring water for someone to drink, if drops of water fall on the person's feet; the drops are not Uchchhista, but considered part of the ground. The concept of Uchchhishta focuses on purification by washing one's hands and mouth after eating. The cleansing is extended to the kitchen so that so no trace of Uchchhishta or cooking of the meal before, is left.  Association with Hindu deities  The Hindu goddess Matangi is offered the taboo Uchchhishta food by the devotee in the ritually impure Uchchhishta state, with unwashed mouth and hands. Offering Uchchhishta food to Hindu deities or worship by an Uchchhishta person is prohibited in mainstream Hinduism. However, the esoteric Tantric goddess Matangi is recommended to be offered Uchchhishta food, in the polluted Uchchhishta state, with the remains of food in the mouth and hands; Matangi is associated with pollution and the outcaste and embodies the forbidden transgression of social norms.Kinsley pp. 214‚Äì6 The goddess in a legend from the Shaktisamgama-tantram is also said to be born from Uchchhishta. The deity couples of Shiva-Parvati and Vishnu- Lakshmi dropped specks of food on the ground while eating. A divine maiden rose from the Uchchhishta and asked for their Uchchhishta. The deities blessed her and gave her the name Uchchhishta-Matangini (Matangi).Kinsley p. 213 Another Tantric deity worshipped in the impure Uchchhishta state is Uchchhishta Ganapati ‚Äì a Tantric form of the elephant-headed god Ganesha ‚Äì who also derives his name from Uchchhishta.Grewal pp. 122‚Äì3 While Matangi is offered human Uchchhishta, the goddess Vimala is offered divine Uchchhishta of the god Jagannath, a form of Vishnu. Vimala is the Tantric consort of Jagannath and the guardian goddess of the Jagannath Temple, Puri ‚Äì the principal temple of the god. Vimala is said to be survive of the Uchchhishta of Jagannath; vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (prasad). A legend justifies this tradition. Once, Shiva ate a food grain, the Uchchhishta of Vishnu as the latter's prasad. Half the grain stuck in Shiva's bread; however the sage Narada noticed it and ate it. Parvati, was upset that her rightful share of Vishnu's prasad had been eaten by Narada. In a peeved mood, she went to Vishnu and complained. Vishnu pacified her saying that in the Kali Yuga (the present era as per Hindu beliefs), she would live at Puri as Vimala, and would daily eat the remnants of his food. In later versions of the Hindu epic Ramayana, Shabari, a forest dweller woman, is instructed by her guru to wait for the arrival of the god Rama in her hermitage. She daily collects wild berries tasting them once for sourness, keeping only the sweet ones and discarding the bitter ones so that she could offer the god Rama only sweet berries, when he visits her. Unknowingly, the berries become Uchchhishta. Over time, she ages to an elderly woman. When Rama finally visits her hermitage, Shabari offers him the Uchchhishta berries. Lakshmana, Rama's brother, objects to the impurity of the Uchchhishta berries, unworthy to be eaten. However, Rama accepts the Uchchhishta berries, as they offered it with great love and devotion.Khare p. 108Keshavadas pp. 121‚Äì5  See also  * Etiquette of Indian dining Notes References    Indian cuisine Indian culture Taboo Etiquette Sanskrit words and phrases ","title":"Uchchhishta"},{"id":"58432751","text":"was a Japanese physicist whose field of work was in plasma physics and fusion power. He was a pioneer in developing ways to generate electricity by nuclear fusion when he worked at General Atomics. Ohkawa died September 27, 2014 in La Jolla, California at the age of 86.  Early life and career  Ohkawa was born in Kanazawa on January 3, 1928. He studied physics at the University of Tokyo in 1950, and was a member of the Yoshio Nishina group for researching cosmic altitude radiation for 16 years even during the World War II. He was a researcher at CERN and at Midwestern State University before becoming a professor at the University of Tokyo. In 1960, he went to General Atomics, where he led a fusion research project and later became vice president and deputy chairman of the board. In 1994, Ohkawa left General Atomics to found TOYO Technologies. In 2004, he was co-founder of Nano Fusion Technologies with Masano Nishikawa for the development of microfluidics. He was also a physics professor at the University of California, San Diego.  Scientific contributions  In 1955, Ohkawa independently came up with idea of the fixed- field alternating gradient accelerator (FFAG) together with Keith Symon and Andrei Kolomensky, which led to the development of the first prototype in 1956 by the Midwestern Universities Research Association (MURA). He then developed a procedure to stabilize instabilities in tokamaks using multipole magnetic fields with Donald Kerst in 1960, which was then later confirmed by experiments. In 1968, Ohkawa demonstrated that the plasma-current multipole configuration used to trap plasmas was stable, which resulted in the development of a series of tokamaks with vertically elongated plasma cross sections called the doublet. This eventually led to General Atomics' DIII-D tokamak, which influenced the design and concept of ITER. Ohkawa was also involved in the use of radioactive isotopes in the separation of nuclear isotopes from nuclear waste (at the Archimedes Technology Group in San Diego, which he founded). Ohkawa holds over 50 patents, in areas such as tile accelerators, fusion technology and biotechnology.  Honors and awards  In 1968, Ohkawa became a Fellow of the American Physical Society. In 1979, he received the James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics for \\"his development of multi-current or doublet approach to the design of tokamaks with non- circular cross sections and for investigation of plasma confinement in toroidal multipoles\\". He also received the 1984 Fusion Power Associates Leadership Award.

Each aircraft was entered in two variants, one powered by the Argus engine and other with the more powerful Hirth HM 8U V-8. The engine was developed in three versions.

He died of yellow fever a few months after taking office. Family Charles Desnotz (or des Nos) was born around 1645. The des Nos family was a knightly family of Breton origin that became established in Mayenne in the 17th century. Charles des Nos was the seigneur of Forbois, of Val in Larchamp and of Champrouzier in Saint-Pierre- des-Landes. His brother Gilles des Nos had a notable career in the naval armed forces and in 1720 became lieutenant general and commander in chief of all the South American seas. Early career In 1692 Charles des Nos (1645-1701), Comte des Nos de Forbonest, was capitaine de vaisseau in command of the Soleil Royal. He participated in the Action at Barfleur on 29 May 1692, when the Soleil Royal was the flagship of Admiral Anne Hilarion de Tourville. He was made a chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis. In 1694 he became a chef d'escadre des arm√©es navales. Governor general of the French Antilles Thomas-Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg Amblimont, governor and lieutenant general of the French Antilles, died of yellow fever in Martinique on 17 August 1700. Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut was made interim lieutenant general on 17 August 1700. Desnotz was named governor and lieutenant general on 1 January 1701 and was received in Martinique on 23 May 1701. Fran√ßois-Roger Robert was intendant, responsible for civil administration and justice, throughout Desnotz's term of office. Desnotz made his residence in Fort Royal, Martinique. It was clear that a European war was imminent, since the Duke of Anjou had just become King Philip V of Spain, and the other powers of Europe would not allow one family to hold the crowns of France and Spain. The former governor Nicolas de Gabaret had installed the Saint-Nicolas battery to protect the bay of Saint-Pierre. Desnotz added eleven more cannons to the battery, and in the 18th century it was renamed the d'Esnotz Battery. In July he went to Guadeloupe to consult with Governor Charles Auger, and to urge him to immediately start preparations for war. He promised to give Auger all the assistance he needed. Desnotz died of yellow fever in Martinique on 6 October 1701 and Guitaud was made interim lieutenant general for the fourth time. Desnotz was buried in the Fort Royal church. The marquis de Rosmadec was appointed to replace Desnotz, but died in Havana before taking office. Guitaud also died in September 1702 and was replaced as acting governor general by Nicolas de Gabaret.. Eventually, on 24 March 1703, Desnotz was replaced by Charles-Fran√ßois de Machault de Belmont.

Private life Kƒ±nar Hanƒ±m was born in Istanbul, then Ottoman Empire, in 1876. She entered acting in her early age owing to her Armenian mother Bercuhi Hanƒ±m, who was a stage actress in the \\"Fasulyeciyan Theater Company\\". During the six-year lasting theater tour in the Balkans, she married to Ar≈üag Sƒ±vacƒ±yan, who was an actor and comedian of the samr theater company. She gave birth to a son Yetvart. However, she lost her husband and son at a young age. She died at her home in Kadƒ±k√∂y on 13 August 1950, and was interred at the Kadƒ±k√∂y Armenian Cemetery in Uzun√ßayƒ±r, Istanbul. Acting career She debuted on the stage at the age of 14 encouraged by her mother. She performed the role for \\"Victor\\" in the play \\"K√∂r√ºn Oƒülu\\" (\\"Son of a Blind\\") in Tekirdaƒü. In the following years, she played with the Fasulyeciyan Theater Company. At her age of 18, she became a regular member of the theater company. She toured six years long Balkans, which are today Bulgaria and Romania, with the theater company. Returned home in 1901, she joined the \\"Mƒ±nakyan Theater Company\\". She was the promoted to the leading actress of the theater company. She became also an actress sought by many other theater companies, which were established in the liberal atmosphere of the Second Constitutional Era (1908‚Äì1919). In 1912, she co- founded the \\"Yeni Osmanlƒ± Tiyatrosu\\" (\\"New Ottoman Theater\\") in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Istanbul together with Aghavni Zabel Binemeciyan and Sƒ±rapyon Hekimyan, another members of the Mƒ±nakyan Theater Company. The theater closed down in 1915 following the death of Binemeciyan. On 19 January 1916, she performed in the play √á√ºr√ºk Temel, an adaptation from the French play La Maison d'Argile by √âmile Fabre (1869‚Äì1955). It was the gala event for the celebration of the opening of the theater section of Dar√ºlbedayi, the first Imperial conservatory in the Ottoman Empire established in 1914. The Dar√ºlbedayi in the Ottoman Empire became later Istanbul City Theatres in the Republican Era. Her notable roles were in the theater plays Dalida, Kantocu Kƒ±z, Ekmek√ßi Kadƒ±n, Fanfan and G√ºlnihal. She performed under the direction of Muhsin Ertuƒürul, prominent actor and art director. She unexpectedly retired from acting in the1930s. According to rumors, her departure from the theater was due to the increasing number of Muslim Turkish women in the theater, who spoke Turkish language without accent contrary to non-Muslims. However, as remembered by her disciple actor Vasfi Rƒ±za Zobu (1902‚Äì1992), she left the Istanbul City Theatres resentful. She was associated with notable theater figures of the era like Eliza Binemeciyan (1890‚Äì1981), Neyyire Neyir (1902‚Äì1943), Afife Jale (1902‚Äì1941), Muammer Karaca (1906‚Äì1978), Muhsin Ertuƒürul (1892‚Äì1979), Hagop Ayvaz (1911‚Äì2006)and Bedia Muvahhit (1897‚Äì1994). Recognition Muhsin Ertuƒürul laudably referred to her as \\"the most competent actress of the Turkish theater in that era\\". Turkish poet Ece Ayhan dedicated her poem \\"Kƒ±nar Hanƒ±m'ƒ±n Denizleri\\" (\\"The Seas of Kƒ±nar Hanƒ±m\\") to Kƒ±nar Hanƒ±m in her 1959 published book.

It was built by the Pesaro family in the fifteenth century in Venetian Gothic style. From 1902 it was the home of Mariano Fortuny and his wife Henriette Negrin. It now houses the Museo Fortuny, and may also be called Palazzo Fortuny.  History  The palace is in the sestiere of San Marco, in the centre of the city, and lies between the Campo San Beneto and the Rio di Ca' Michiel. It has a fa√ßade onto each, while the northern fa√ßade is on the Calle Pesaro. It was built in the fifteenth century by Benedetto Pesaro, member of the prominent , and is one of several palaces of that family in the city. The San Beneto branch of the family died out towards the end of the seventeenth century, and from about 1720 the palace was let to various tenants, among them a printer ‚Äì the Tipografia Albrizzi ‚Äì and two musical associations, first the Accademia degli Orfei from 1786 and then, from 1835, the Societ√† Apollinea. For most of the nineteenth century the building was subdivided and let to various artisans. By the time Mariano Fortuny established his first Venetian studio there, in the last years of the century, there were some 350 tenants. He gradually bought up space, demolishing the later dividing walls and restoring the rooms bit by bit to their earlier form; in 1902 he made it his home. In 1907, together with his future wife Henriette Negrin, he established a small workshop; within a few years, two floors of the palace were devoted to the printing of silk and velvet clothing and textiles. Fortuny died in 1949, and in 1956 the palace was gifted to the comune of Venice; the comune took full possession only in 1965, after the death of Fortuny's widow Henriette. The Museo Fortuny was opened in 1975.

His works have been widely performed by international ensembles and he was a recipient of the 2013 Paul Hamlyn Foundation Award for Composers. He is currently Reader in Composition at the University of Huddersfield. His music deals with ideas of repetition and memory by using ‚Äúrecursive musical structures‚Äù and sometimes extended durations, such as the 45-minute ensemble work Repetitions in Extended Time (2008) and the 76-minute piano piece Vessels (2013).  Education  Harrison initially studied at the Leeds College of Music (1988‚Äì91), before completing a master's degree under composer Gavin Bryars at De Montfort University, Leicester. In 1999 he was selected to compete for the Gaudeamus International Composers Award in the Netherlands. He also studied briefly with Christian Wolff and Alvin Lucier in 2001 at the Ostrava Days in the Czech Republic. He was awarded a PhD degree by the University of Huddersfield in 2007.  Career  Harrison established an early relationship with the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, where his music was presented in 1993 and 1995, before he received festival commissions in 1999 and was the festival's featured composer in 2008. Ensembles and soloists who have performed his music include Ensemble recherche, Klangforum Wien, the London Sinfonietta, the London Symphony Orchestra, Apartment House, Plus-Minus, Asamisimasa, ELISION, EXAUDI, the pianists Philip Thomas and Mark Knoop, and the violinist Aisha Orazbayeva.  Style  Harrison's work is influenced by the music of Morton Feldman. Feldman and Harrison's works share a general quietness and contemplativeness, a static texture and a concern with repetition or, in Harrison's words, \\"use of recursive musical forms which challenge our perceptions of time and space by viewing the same material from different angles and perspectives.\\" Other composers for whom Harrison has expressed an admiration include John Cage, Laurence Crane, Tim Parkinson, James Saunders, Richard Glover, Howard Skempton, Christopher Fox, Linda Catlin Smith, Martin Arnold, and Cassandra Miller. Harrison has also been influenced by visual artists such as Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, James Hugonin and the painter and printmaker Mike Walker, with whom he has collaborated. The artwork of Bridget Riley has been an especially important source for Harrison's work, in works such as Six Symmetries (2004), in which Harrison traced musical notation from geometric contours similar to those in Riley's 1960s paintings.

Two men who had been plundering at will in full Highland dress after the Dress Act 1746 had made it illegal to wear it, had been captured by soldiers of the British Army, but a large mob secured their release. Background After the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Dress Act 1746 was passed by George II of Great Britain making it illegal, as of 1 August 1747, for any man or boy to wear Highland dress. However, there was a lack of cooperation, as the military saw it, of the civilian authorities to bring in offenders. Captain Hughes of Pulteney's Regiment reported from his headquarters at Loch Rannoch in August 1749 that the local sheriff depute had been dismissing individuals taken before him for wearing Highland dress. The incident Later that month Captain Hughes reported that a party of fully armed Highlanders had been plundering at Killiecrankie. They were chased as far as Aberfeldy but they escaped because the soldiers could get no help from the local people. However, two of the men were later captured at Killin, but while the Corporal was conducting the two offenders to Captain Hughes he was met by the sheriff depute and a mob. The sheriff depute ordered the soldiers to release the two prisoners or he would put the soldiers in prison and at the same time \\"abuse\\" them for \\"molesting\\" people for wearing dress that he thought should be tolerated. The soldiers then released the prisoners. Aftermath Captain Hughes reported the incident as \\"the People Insult & Triumph, and while their sheriff depute protects them, make a Jest of Military Power\\". Captain Hughes reported on 1 October 1749 that one of his patrols in Killin had captured one Duncan Campbell on 22 September who had been wearing \\"Tartan Clothes\\" and that he was then confined in the prison of Killin. Captain Hughes also reported that they had recently pursued three armed men who had attacked some cattle drovers and stolen their cattle, but that the Highlanders being lighter armed and dressed were able to escape. Similar incidents were reported around the same time in other parts of the Scottish Highlands: On 16 September 1749 a Captain Scott of Guise's Regiment who was stationed at Braemar Barracks reported that his men had pursued a Highlander who had appeared armed and in \\"Highland Dress\\" but that he had fairly outrun them and that they had opened fire on him as he ran into a wood, but missed him. The same Captain reported on 1 October 1749 that one of his Sergeants was missing, presumed murdered, who had been in pursuit of four men who had appeared armed and in \\"Highland Garb\\", and who were presumed to be thieves. The Captain reported again that as of October 4, 1749 the Sergeant was still missing and presumed murdered.Allardyce (1895). p. 527. The ban on wearing Highland dress was repealed in 1782 and the wearing of it returned to civil use. However, it became a fashion for both the English and Scots, and in particular the English aristocracy. The seal of royal approval for wearing both tartan and Highland dress came in 1822 when George IV of Great Britain made his visit to Edinburgh dressed accordingly.

There are legends that state that the Mansi people of Western Siberia rode moose into battle but there is no evidence of this. In 17th-century Sweden Charles XI trialled the use of moose as a replacement for horses, which had to be imported. However they proved susceptible to disease, hard to feed and fearful of the sound of gunfire. The use of moose cavalry by the Soviets in the Winter War of 1939 and 1940 is also reported but seems to stem from a 2010 Popular Mechanics April Fools' Day article.  Russia  Legends state that the Mansi people of Western Siberia rode into battle mounted on moose. The antlers of the animals are said to have been painted red. No evidence of such use has been found. In the 18th-century Catherine the Great is said to have outlawed the domestication of the moose out of fear that dissidents exiled to Siberia might use them as mounts in any armed rebellion against her. The story is believed to be apocryphal.  Sweden  The moose (Eurasian elk, Alces alces alces) had been used in Sweden to draw the sleighs of the Royal couriers since at least the reign of Charles IX. They proved effective in this role, able to travel around in a day. Some sources state that as a development of this role Charles XI (1660‚Äì1697) trialled the use of moose cavalry. The intention was apparently to replace the horses of one of his cavalry regiments with moose, to avoid the need to import horses as was the contemporary practice. It is said to have been thought that the animals would cause fear in the horses of enemy cavalry, allowing formations to be broken without the need for artillery or musketry. The idea was allegedly presented to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. It is said that during training the moose was too fearful to allow itself to be ridden into battle and took fright at the sound of gunfire. They were also said to be of too peaceful a nature for the purpose. Moose were also more susceptible to disease than horses and there was difficulty in feeding the animals which were used to foraging across large areas rather than being fed on fodder in pasture. Swedish historian Dick Harrison has stated that he has found no evidence for the trial or use of moose cavalry in contemporary sources and that it is most likely a myth.  April Fools' Day hoax  Some news outlets have reported that Joseph Stalin attempted to introduce the moose as a replacement for horses in Soviet cavalry regiments based in the northern parts of the country during the 1930s. The story is thought to have been popularised by a 2010 April Fools' Day article published in the Russian language edition of Popular Mechanics. The article claimed that 1,500 moose cavalrymen were trained for service in the Winter War of 1939 and 1940. Machine guns were supposedly mounted to the antlers of the moose. Among the more outlandish claims was that the start of the war was postponed to avoid clashing with the moose mating season and that the animals could distinguish between the Russian and Finnish languages at a distance of over a kilometre. The article included several photographs supposedly showing members of the moose cavalry unit. These were in fact posed by members of Popular Mechanics' publishing house dressed in reproduction Red Army uniforms with the moose superimposed in post-processing. A graphics artist, Vitas Chernyauskas, mocked-up the front cover of an instruction manual for the unit, based on contemporary Soviet documents and this was also included in the article. The hoax article was widely reproduced in Russian media over the following years, often without the April Fools' Day disclaimer carried in the original article. Posters on military history forums often claimed to have seen, or even read, copies of the fictional instruction manual. The coverage in newspapers, satirical sites and social media meant that the story gained a measure of credence as a historical fact. Moose were later successfully domesticated in Soviet Russia but as livestock, for their milk and antlers. In 2017, a war museum in Lakhdenpokhya, Karelia, Russia showcased the doctored photographs from the Popular Mechanics article in an exhibition as a recent discovery of historic documents. The exhibition claimed that the \\"war moose\\" had been trained by the Soviet army for four years. The story, sourced from the museum exhibition, was covered by the Finnish national public broadcaster Yle in a television broadcast and as an online news article in June 2017. Yle was informed of the errors in the story by a member of the public but only issued a correction one month later. As a consequence they were investigated by the Finnish media regulator the Council for Mass Media in Finland for failures in fact-checking and responding to the error report. The erroneous story is still available on the Yle website, including the doctored images from Popular Mechanics, but with a disclaimer and link to the Council for Mass Media's findings. There is some information relating to Soviet moose cavalry trials that pre-dates the 2010 hoax. In 2004 the manager of the Kostroma Moose Farm, where the Soviets domesticated the moose for milk production in the 1940s, claimed that the trials were carried out in the 1930s. He claimed that \\"Stalin thought elk could replace horses in cavalry regiments based in the north ... but this did not work out, and the idea was abandoned\\".

He was a leading player at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal and the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase Dramatique. His most celebrated role was Fadinard in Un chapeau de paille d'Italie (The Italian Straw Hat) Life and career =Early years= Ravel was born in Bordeaux, the son of a horse dealer. As a young man he was employed as a clerk, first to a notary in Bordeaux, and then to an optician in Paris.\\"The French Plays at the Princess's Theatre\\", The Graphic, 17 May 1873, p. 455 He joined a travelling theatre troupe and learned the craft of acting. From 1837 to 1841 he was engaged by the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville in Paris. His first major role was in a piece called Tourlourou, where, according to Henry Lyonnet's Dictionnaire des com√©diens fran√ßais (1912), he showed \\"a charming verve in the gallant and vivacious character of Fleur d'amour\\". He created more than twenty roles for the Vaudeville. Ravel as Lecoq in Pages et Poissardes by Edmond Rochefort and Bernard Lopez, 1840 In May 1841 Ravel first appeared at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal, where he remained a leading player for twenty years. \\"To list Ravel's creations at the Palais-Royal\\", wrote one of his biographers, \\"is to put before the reader's eyes the greatest successes of this theatre from 1841 to 1862\\". The Palais-Royal company made several appearances in London during Ravel's time, beginning in 1848, when one London critic wrote of him: Lyonnet lists some of Ravel's starring roles in his first decade at the Palais-Royal between 1841, but comments that they were all eclipsed by his greatest success, Fadinard in the 1851 comedy Un chapeau de paille d'Italie (The Italian Straw Hat), by Eug√®ne Labiche and Marc-Michel, which Lyonnet describes as the Palais-Royal's greatest success. =Later years= Ravel by Lh√©ritier Around 1863 Ravel's status as the leading star of the Palais-Royal began to be undermined. The first factor was the success of another Labiche play, La Cagnotte(fr) (The Jackpot), in which Ravel did not appear but which established Jean-Marie Geoffroy(fr) as a rival star at the theatre. Another development that harmed Ravel's career was the increasing popularity of op√©rette bouffe while Ravel's genre, com√©die en vaudevilles, was in decline.\\"The French Plays\\", The Pall Mall Gazette, 27 June 1867, p. 10 Ravel embarked on tours in the French provinces and abroad, generally without much success, although he was well received in London in 1867.\\"French Plays\\", The Times, 18 July 1867, p. 6 He returned to France, and was engaged by the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase Dramatique in October 1868 to recreate one of his earlier successes, Un monsieur qui suit les femmes (A man who pursues women), by Th√©odore Barri√®re and Adrien Decourcelle, first seen in 1850. There followed successful revivals of more of his best-known vehicles. In 1876 Ravel returned to the Palais-Royal in Mon mari est √† Versailles, the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin in Les enfants du Capitaine Grant (1878) and Cendrillon (Cinderella, 1878).Lyonnet, pp. 586‚Äì587 Over the years Ravel developed and changed his acting style. During his first 20 years at the Palais-Royal, he had specialised in juveniles, dashing but na√Øve, highly articulate and moving at high speed. Later he displayed what Lyonnet calls \\"a delicacy and a delightful gentleness\\". An English critic, writing in 1873, wrote that although he was essentially a comedian, Ravel also possessed considerable powers of pathos. Another critic called him \\"inimitable ‚Ä¶ full of life and gaiety, his countenance, by-play, and pantomime causing shouts of laughter. He is, undoubtedly, a great artist.\\"\\"French Plays‚ÄîSt James's\\", The Era, 11 June 1848, pp. 11‚Äì12 Ravel had no thought of retirement, and in 1881, at the age of 70, he was on the verge of taking up a new post as stage manager of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Monte Carlo when he died suddenly at Neuilly-sur-Seine.

History  Iviyo had its origins in Zululand, in 1944, when Anglican priest Philip Mbatha had a vision of Jesus as the Good Shepherd. At more or less the same time, another priest from the Diocese of St John's, Alpheus Zulu, (who later became bishop of Zululand), was experiencing a crisis in his ministry. The two priests met periodically for the next few years and in 1948, founded Iviyo. The priests were motivated to start the movement on the basis of their visionary experiences and their view of the Anglican church as dry and equivocal. The movement they formed was essentially extremely high church, incorporating pentecostal evangelicalism. Iviyo is a Zulu Anglican movement that is expressly high church, charismatic and evangelical. The high church roots can be explained by the founders' close association with the Community of the Resurrection. Its aim was to promote Christian proficiency ‚Äî living a disciplined Christian life of prayer, fasting, sacraments, Bible reading, confession and evangelism. During the Apartheid era in the 1980s, Iviyo was seen as being aligned with the Zulu Nationalist/Inkatha/right-wing political forces. In 2018, the Diocese of Grahamstown started a Xhosa language version of the movement, named Ibutho Labavakalisi Bakakristu.
