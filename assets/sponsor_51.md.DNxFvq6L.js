Wahab Al Kalbi joined Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala and fought alongside him. He belonged to Al Kalb tribe majority of whom were adherents of Christianity at that time. His mother, Umm Wahab was amongst the female casualties in Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala. Early life and conversion to Islam Wahab was a Christian by birth and converted to Islam. He was a known businessperson of Kufa. Wahab discussed with his mother and wife before converting to Islam and later joining Al Husayn ibn Ali in the battle against Yazid's forces. Wahab was returning from Kufa after getting married. He was still seventeen years and his wife was just twelve years old. When Wahab was passing from Karbala he saw Husayn ibn Ali surrounded by the enemies and was along with his family and very few friends. Wahab was inspired by Al Husayn‚Äôs spiritual charisma in such a manner that he was reluctant to leave him despite of being aware about the consequences of staying with Husayn ibn Ali. Wahab was a tall and masculine man with broad shoulders, who was held with very high esteem among his people, and was known of his courage and soldierly experience. On the preceding night of Ashura the following conversion was held between Wahab and his mother: Wahab asked her: 'Mother! What should I do in this situation?' The mother asked Wahab: 'How do you feel yourself, my son?' Wahab said: 'In my opinion Husayn is on the just path and it would be cowardly and against all traditions of Arab chivalry and gallantry to leave the side of a man so isolated and surrounded by blood-thirsty enemies.' The mother said: 'But that means definite death.' Wahab replied: 'Yes I know, but my heart tells me that this is the right thing to do, in these circumstances.' The mother then said: 'If that is how you feel then we will stay with Husayn.' Wahab‚Äôs mother then pleaded on his behalf and said: \\"O grandson of the Prophet of Islam! It will be an honor for me if my son fights for you and gives his life protecting you.\\" Husayn was still reluctant to accept Wahab as one of his soldiers and advised him not to risk his life that too in a matter which concerns Muslims. When Abu Wahab saw this, he said: 'O grandson of the Prophet of Islam! If that is the case then, from this moment on, I am a Muslim.' Wahab testified (Shahada) that: ‚ÄúThere is no deity besides Allah and Muhammad is His messenger‚Äù Wahab's Duel in Battle of Karbala After Wahab converted to Islam, he was granted permission by Husayn ibn Ali to fight the Yazid's forces on his side. In the first campaign of battle of Karbala, Yasir, Ziyad's slave and Salim, Ibn Ziyad's slave set out and challenged anyone from Husayn ibn Ali's army to have a duel with them. At this, Habib ibn Mazahir and Burayr expressed their desire to take up the challenge nevertheless they were denied permission by Husayn ibn Ali. When Wahab asked for the permission, Husayn granted him permission believing him to be match for both the challengers. Wahab stepped into the battlefield and the challengers asked his identity to which he introduced himself. However they could not recognize him and asked either Zuhayr ibn Qayn, Habib ibn Muzahir or Burayr to fight them. Yasir was standing nearby to whom Wahab said \\"You son of the adulteress! Do you not wish to fight me?!\\" saying this he attacked Yasir and engaged him in a sword duel but at the same time Salim charged at him with his sword. Wahab while protecting himself lost fingers of his left hand and in retaliatory attack he killed Salim and Yasir. After killing both of them he moved back to Al Husayn while reciting Martial poetry. Umm Wahab was watching every thing. After witnessing a brave combat of her son she came to Wahab and said: ‚ÄúMay both my parents be sacrificed for you! Do defend the good ones, the offspring of Muhammed, Allah's peace and blessings be upon him and his progeny!‚Äù She did not leave and wanted to die with him, however Husayn ibn Ali intervened and said: ‚ÄúMay you be well rewarded on behalf of your Prophet's Ahl al-Bayt! Go back to the tent! Women are not required to fight!‚Äù and she followed the instructions.Al Athir, Ibn. 04. p. 037.  Harith Ibn Shakir Friend of Abdullah ibn Omayr Abu Wahab al Kalbi Harith bin al-Shakir also popularly known as Harith bin Amr bin Shakir was one of the prominent companions of the first grandson of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, Imam Al-Husain who was one of the martyrs of the battle of Karbala in 680 AD. He was from Banu Shakir clan of the Great Banu Hamdan tribe, a well-known tribe that dates back to the first millennium BCE and originated in area around the present day Yemen. He was among the famous people of Kufa, an ancient city that holds the remains of Imam Al-Husain. It was reported that Harith bin Amr bin Shakir was a very wealthy merchant and powerful public speaker in Kufa during his days. Upon the death of Mu'awiya in 680 AD, Harith bin al-Shakir and many other conspicuous follower and communal Supporter of Imam Al-Hussain sent letters to Imam Al- Hussain inviting him to take the place of Mu‚Äôawiya and rule Kufa, they all pledge their allegiance in the same year and promised supports to him.  Death  Wahab participated in the retaliatory attack when Al Shimr attacked Al Husayn's right wing. Wahab in that engagement killed 31 of them, of which 19 were Horsemen and 12 were Footmen. His right hand was severed by Hani ibn thabit al Hadrami and left hand by Bakr ibn Hayy having left without arms he was taken captive and killed on that spot. Wahab was then beheaded and his head was thrown towards Husayn ibn Ali's camp, it was picked up by his mother, she took it, wiped the blood from it then ran in the direction of the enemy forces. Husayn ibn Ali sent her back saying, ‚ÄúGo back, may Allah have mercy on you, for you are exempted from participating in Jihad.‚Äù She went back saying, ‚ÄúO Allah! Do not disappoint me!‚Äù Al Husayn said to her, ‚ÄúMay Allah never disappoint you!‚Äù  Death of Umm Wahab at Karbala  Umm Wahab, wife of Abu Wahab was the daughter of Abdullah, who belonged to Al Nimr ibn Qasit, was reported to have approached Husayn ibn Ali and asked him 'Are you the rightful Imam ?' Husayn replied: 'Yes, I am.' She said: 'Then if Wahab dies protecting you, he would go to the Paradise?' Husayn said: 'Yes, he would.' Then she said:'Can you promise me that you would not let Wahab enter Paradise without me ?' Husayn said:' Yes, I promise you, you and Wahab will enter Paradise together.' When Wahab was killed, she walked towards his corpse and sat by his headless body, saying, ‚ÄúCongratulations for having earned Paradise! I plead to Allah Who blessed you with Paradise to make me join you.‚Äù Al Shimr heard her and ordered his slave Rustam to hit her head with a rod or mace, which he did. She died there.

In 1991, the study was recognized by Garland Publishing and presented as an Outstanding Dissertation in Linguistics.Cole, Jennifer S. Planar Phonology and Morphology, Outstanding Dissertations in Linguistics. New York: Garland. 1991. Cole introduced ranked constraints in formal grammar to model the interaction between morphology and phonology. This was one of the first works in the generative phonology framework to model phonological grammar using constraint ranking, an approach which has been developed in Optimality Theory. A primary focus of Cole's research is on variation in the phonetic expression of words and the role of prosodic phrasing and prominence in influencing phonetic variation. She applies linguistic models of prosody to research in computer speech recognition. Cole has carried out field research and authored encyclopedia articles on Sindhi (Indo-Aryan).

The newspaper proposed to move the station to Elmira and change its frequency to 1420 kHz.\\"Applications: May 19\\" , Broadcasting, June 1, 1932, page 28. However, this plan was abandoned a few months later, when the newspaper decided to instead lease Cornell University's station in Ithaca, WEAI.\\"Ithaca Station Changes Control and Call Letters\\", Broadcasting, October 15, 1932, page 8. (WESG in Ithaca is now WHCU). Therefore the WESG call letters were transferred to the Ithaca operation, with the Glens Falls station changing its call sign to WGLC,\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, September 30, 1932, page 14. and remaining on 1370 kHz. The next year WGLC moved to Hudson Falls, New York. In late 1934 the call letters were changed to WABY,\\"Changes to List\\", Radio Service Bulletin, December 15, 1934, page 44. when Al Kelert moved the station to Albany,\\"Changes to List\\", Radio Service Bulletin, December 31, 1934, page 7. in turn making the first station to broadcast from that city (though not the first one to originate, a distinction held by WOKO, now WOPG). WABY moved to 1400 kHz in 1941 due to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) frequency shift. The station provided the typical mix of popular music and network programming throughout most of its first 30 years of service. In 1961, the station changed to a high energy top-40 format, but was short lived as the competition in that format was intense, leaving the format in late 1963. From 1964 to 1971, WABY ran a MOR format, followed by oldies in 1971, and a return to top-40 in 1973. By 1976, it had changed to all-news, using NBC's \\"News and Information Service.\\" It then switched to country in 1979. In 1981, WABY changed to a Christian format until 1982 when it was flipped to adult standards. Getting many key market names, WABY spent years as one of the highest-rated standards stations in the United States, and added an FM simulcast on 94.5 MHz in 1995. In February 1999, Bendat sold his stations to Tele-Media, Inc., which switched the AM side to an all-news format by day with simulcasting of the FM (which itself would flip to adult contemporary that summer) on nights and weekends. This arrangement remained through Tele-Media's ownership of the station through Tele-Media's sale of WABY and WKLI to Galaxy Communications in August 2001 and through the flip of 94.5 FM to classic rock as WRCZ. On April 22, 2002, after 68 years, the WABY calls left 1400 kHz as Galaxy replaced it with WHTR and launched a hot talk simulcast with new move in 93.7 FM. (As a tribute, a Mechanicville, New York station (now WSSV) adopted the WABY call letters from 2002-2014). The talk format was short- lived, and that August, 1400 and 93.7 switched to modern rock as WKRD (1400 retained the WHTR calls). Galaxy sold 1400 to Northeast Public Radio (WAMC, Inc.) in February 2003, giving it the WAMC calls (90.3 FM took on the WAMC-FM calls as a result). The WABY call sign was displayed on the WAMC tower until recently, although the current WABY broadcasts from a different location.

The base-2 logarithm of is often referred to as the doubling dimension of . Euclidean spaces equipped with the usual Euclidean metric are examples of doubling spaces where the doubling constant depends on the dimension . For example, in one dimension, ; and in two dimensions, . Assouad's embedding theorem An important question in metric space geometry is to characterize those metric spaces that can be embedded in some Euclidean space by a bi-Lipschitz function. This means that one can essentially think of the metric space as a subset of Euclidean space. Not all metric spaces may be embedded in Euclidean space. Doubling metric spaces, on the other hand, would seem like they have more of a chance, since the doubling condition says, in a way, that the metric space is not infinite dimensional. However, this is still not the case in general. The Heisenberg group with its Carnot metric is an example of a doubling metric space which cannot be embedded in any Euclidean space. Assouad's Theorem states that, for a M-doubling metric space X, if we give it the metric d(x, y)Œµ for some 0 < Œµ < 1, then there is a L-bi-Lipschitz map f:X ‚Üí ‚Ñùd, where d and L depend on M and Œµ. Doubling Measures =Definition= A nontrivial measure on a metric space X is said to be doubling if the measure of any ball is finite and approximately the measure of its double, or more precisely, if there is a constant C > 0 such that : 0<mu(B(x,2r))leq Cmu(B(x,r))<infty , for all x in X and r > 0. In this case, we say Œº is C-doubling. A metric measure space that supports a doubling measure is necessarily a doubling metric space, where the doubling constant depends on the constant C. Conversely, any complete doubling metric space supports a doubling measure. =Examples= A simple example of a doubling measure is Lebesgue measure on a Euclidean space. One can, however, have doubling measures on Euclidean space that are singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. One example on the real line is the weak limit of the following sequence of measures: : dmu_n = prod_{i=1}^n (1+acos (3^i 2pi x)),dx,;;; a<1. One can construct another singular doubling measure Œº on the interval [0, 1] as follows: for each k ‚â• 0, partition the unit interval [0,1] into 3k intervals of length 3‚àík. Let Œî be the collection of all such intervals in [0,1] obtained for each k (these are the triadic intervals), and for each such interval I, let m(I) denote its \\"middle third\\" interval. Fix 0 < Œ¥ < 1 and let Œº be the measure such that Œº([0, 1]) = 1 and for each triadic interval I, Œº(m(I)) = Œ¥Œº(I). Then this gives a doubling measure on [0, 1] singular to Lebesgue measure. Applications The definition of a doubling measure may seem arbitrary, or purely of geometric interest. However, many results from classical harmonic analysis and computational geometry extend to the setting of metric spaces with doubling measures.

First settled about 1692, it is one of the oldest settlements in Tolland County, and retains a strong sense of 18th century colonial layout. It extends along Storrs Street (Route 195) extending from Chaffeeville Road in the north to Centre Street in the south, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The area that became the town of Mansfield was first settled about 1692, when Storrs Street was laid out and 21 large house lots were allocated. Two buildings survive from the early period of settlement: the Old Uncle Hall Place, set well on the west side of the street, is a significantly altered house built about 1694, and the Eleazer Williams House, built 1710, is a well- preserved Georgian parsonage house. The village was largely bypassed by industrial development in the town, which resulted in the creation of a number of small mill villages, and to some extent by the establishment of the University of Connecticut at Storrs to the north. The result is a cluster of mainly residential 18th and 19th-century buildings, along with the town hall, library, general store, and church. Also surviving is an early 19th-century animal pound, a rectangular stone enclosure now located on private property. and The district is basically linear, extending along Storrs Street between Chafeeville Road and Centre Street. The most architecturally sophisticated house, and its largest 19th-century residence, is the 1836 Fitch Mansion, a fine example of Greek Revival architecture designed by Colonel Edwin Fitch. The First Church of Christ, (Congregational) United Church of Christ is the third to stand on the site; the current structure was built in 1866 after the second burned. The town library is a single-story Georgian Revival brick building, built in 1923 on a site that formerly housed a district school. The 1886 general store stands at the corner of Storrs and Centre Streets; it is one of a small number of surviving 19th-century general stores in the state.

The episode was written by Kevin R. Maynard and was directed by Michael Cuesta. In the episode, the Miami Metro Homicide Department team investigate a blood-soaked crime scene, where blood spatter analyst Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is confronted by a repressed memory of a traumatic incident from his childhood. Meanwhile, Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) is charged with assaulting her ex-husband Paul Bennett (Mark Pellegrino) and risks losing custody of their children, while Det. Angel Batista (David Zayas) investigates a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer has an amputee fetish. Scenes for \\"Seeing Red\\" were shot at several locations around Long Beach, California. Particular attention was paid to the cinematography and filming of the sequence of Dexter's flashbacks to make them feel like \\"fragments of memory\\". The episode received positive reviews from critics, with particular mention made to the scene in which Dexter hits Rita's ex- husband, Paul, in the head with a frying pan because of his threats about the lengths he will go to in order to protect his children. Plot When a key to a hotel room is delivered to the Miami Metro PD inside a jar of blood, Debra and Doakes visit the hotel and find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood‚Äîsitting in a pool of blood at the age of three‚Äîcausing him to run from the scene. The forensics team surmises that the blood came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread around the room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who has had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible. While dating a woman in a bar, Angel sees a prostitute with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted in the same way as the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel speaks to Rudy, who he doesn't realize is the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. He manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy‚Äîwho had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter‚Äîarrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker. Rita finds out that Paul is pressing charges against her for assault. She talks with a lawyer, who tells her that since she invited Paul into her house, she cannot prove that her intent was to defuse the situation. At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making his case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen. Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives him back to his hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison. With encouragement from Rudy, Dexter returns to the bloody hotel room, where he relives his repressed memory. He realizes that he witnessed the murder of his mother with a chainsaw when he was three. Production Since Dexter producers try to shield the child actors as much as possible from the show's dark subject matter, executive producer Daniel Cerone urged the mother of his son's friend not to let her son audition to play a young Dexter, who is filmed sitting in a pool of blood. Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as \\"very uncomfortable to watch, even when you know it's not real and you know these kids are actors.\\" Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them \\"feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background. You don't see all the details of the environment.\\" Series director Keith Gordon found these flashbacks \\"incredible\\" because he thought they were \\"like a Stanley Kubrick movie\\". Several scenes from the episode were filmed on September 28, 2006 with a crew of 200 people in Long Beach, California at the Seaport Marina Hotel, along the Pacific Coast Highway, and on San Anseline Avenue. The Seaport Marina Hotel was used as the setting for Paul's motel, while a house on San Anseline Avenue was used as Rita's house. Reception The episode received positive reviews from critics. Eric Goldman of IGN reviewed \\"Seeing Red\\" warmly and gave the episode an \\"Outstanding\\" rating of 9.0/10. He thought that the scene wherein Dexter hits Paul was \\"one of the most jaw-dropping, intense scenes yet\\", and he liked that Angel's \\"seeming separate\\" subplot was well- linked to the main plotline of the episode. He noted the \\"fascinating dynamic\\" between Dexter and Rudy, sensing \\"interesting psycho-sexual undercurrents\\" developing.

She enjoyed Dexter's manipulation by Rudy and found his solution to Paul's threats \\"perfect\\". Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad wrote that he was \\"in awe\\" of the episode. He was particularly impressed with Dexter's choice to frame Paul rather than kill him, and a minor storyline involving Lt. Mar√≠a LaGuerta (Lauren V√©lez) and her betrayal of her superior, Capt.

History World War II and the occupation by Japanese forces of Pacific Islands and islands to the north of Australia saw Queensland placed under the threat of imminent attack. This placed a great strain on Queensland Railway‚Äôs resources in the movement of wartime supplies and troops. A request was made in 1941 for further, new C17 class locomotives and the specifications were forwarded to the United States where the United States Army Transportation Corps (USATC) drew up plans for a 2-8-2 with specifications similar to a C17 class, which became the USATC S118 Class. These locomotives were intended as a standard design for use on narrow gauge railways in other parts of the world as a wartime measure. Thus twenty engines obtained from the United States under Lend-Lease arrangements and later purchased. They were the only ones of their type to come to Australia out of a total of 741 similar engines built for USATC. They were unloaded in Sydney in 1943 and railed to Brisbane for assembly. Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the AC16 class, C representing they had four driving axles, and the 16 the cylinder diameter in inches. Because the classification was already being used by an existing class they were designated American C16, i.e. AC16. The American steam locomotive earned it the nickname of Yank. The engines entered traffic with their US Army road numbers but had \\"A\\" appended to differentiate them from existing engines with the same numbers. The engines were supplied with conical profile tyres. These were altered to QR standard cylindrical profile and pressed one-sixteenth of an inch inwards on the wheels to reduce wear. In 1943 the decision was taken to alter the second and third coupled wheels to thin flanges. A number of other modifications were carried out over the years. The engines were fitted with Walschaerts valve gear. The original tenders rode poorly and resulted in a speed limit of 30 mph being imposed with a prohibition on passenger train working. The axle load of these tenders also restricted the engines to main line usage. The floor level shovelling plate made the fireman's work more difficult. One feature that did proved popular was the use of louvre coal boards and these subsequently became standard on all QR steam engines. The headlight mounted on the smokebox door proved to have advantages and was later adopted for some other classes. In 1958, No. 217A was fitted with a tender taken from a withdrawn C16 class locomotive. The previous restrictions were then lifted. All 19 members of the class then remaining in service had been similarly treated by 1963. After being fitted with these tenders, seven of the class was attached to Alpha where they had a brief period of glory in the early 1960s when they replaced the C17 Class hauling the air-conditioned Midlander between Alpha and Longreach. The American engines with a larger boiler capacity were able to reduce running times in the sections that contained many long banks. Diesel locomotive took over the working in 1963.

All four models featured fuel injection and 1,089 cc engines. All were short lived and were an attempt to fill a market segment that was rapidly changing.  1981 B1 and 1982 B2 1982 GPZ 1100 The 1981 GPz1100 was the first 1,100 cc motorcycle released by Kawasaki. It was officially marketed as the GPz1100 B1. Its frame design was a typical cradle design and the engine was based on the new z1000J motor, fitted with roller bearings, but the engine capacity was increased to 1,089 cc. Cycle World stated \\"...the big Kawi went well, with standing quarters in just over 11 seconds at 119mph, fastest in its class at the time.\\" Rather than featuring carburetors, the B1 was fitted with electronic fuel injection (EFI) a Bosch-derived Nissan fuel injection as used on the earlier 1980 Z1000G/H models. Suspension and braking was similar to earlier models; the front forks featured 38 mm tubes, the frame design, based on the 1981 J model, was made from larger diameter steel in the section between the steering head to rear of the tank. To reduce weight, the tube walls were thinner. It weighed with a full tank of fuel, and the power output was claimed to be . The B2 featured a cockpit fairing, the use of LCD warning lights and improved engine coating using a black chrome finish instead of the previous black paint. Kawasaki was serious about having the best Superbike, and the B2 was changed in several significant ways over its predecessor. The engine output was increased by increasing the valve lift from 8.3 mm to 8.7 mm, and valve duration was increased from 280 degrees to 288 degrees to boost upper-end horsepower. The early BOSCH-type open-loop analog fuel injection was scrapped, and a new closed-loop digital fuel injection (DFI) was used in its place. The new system did not use an airflap to measure airflow, but a digital microprocessor, a series of sensors, and a throttle position sensor to meter the fuel much more accurately, eliminate throttle lag, and decrease emissions. The suspension calibration was all-new for 1982, to make the big GPz an even better handler both on the track and on the street. The fork had slightly stiffer springs, and compression and rebound damping were increased approximately 10%. In the rear, the Kayaba shocks used the same springs, but with greater pre-load, and the compression damping was effectively doubled. And each of the rebound adjustments offered 30% more damping than its '81 counterpart. Wider, Dunlop K300 tires replaced the Bridgestone tires used on the B1 to improve handling and steering response.  1983 ZX1100-A1  In 1983 a new GPz1100 design was released that featured Unitrack single suspension, anti-dive units on the forks and a major styling overhaul often called the \\"swish\\" look. Known as the ZX1100A1 model, the 1983 model featured a larger fairing (with a lower fairing section as an option to give a full race fairing), different instrumentation and a warning panel mounted on the redesigned petrol tank. This model contained many features that were to appear on the GPz900R model leading to the suspicion that it was used to test the acceptability of newer technology such as Unitrack and Anti-Dive forks and the newer styling. The 1983 model featured the new Alpha-N DFI design with modifications, such as an IAT (intake air temp) inclusion of a warning light that flashed service codes when the DFI system was having a problem, a rev- limiter, and a 'limp' mode that would allow the engine to keep running if one of the sensors failed. The engine design changed in the 1983 model to use underbucket shims similar to the z650 and the camshaft duration was increased from 288 degrees to 300 degrees, and the valve lift increased from 8.7mm to 9.5mm. To flow more air, the head was revised extensively from the earlier model, featuring new ports, a 'bathtub' combustion chamber borrowed from their own S2 racer, and a 1mm larger intake valve recessed into the head slightly for valve clearance. The power output was now claimed to be at 8,750 rpm. CYCLE magazine recorded 104 rear-wheel horsepower on their dynamometer, and Kawasaki was hoping to have a solid 10-second quarter-mile machine. Motorcycle Classics reported \\"Cycle took the revised GPz1100 to the strip and restored its crown as the fastest 1100 in a straight line, with a standing quarter that broke into the 10s.\\"  1984 ZX1100-A2  In 1984 the last GPz1100 was released, competition from sales of the GPz900R released in 1984 had surpassed the GPz1100, so the 1100 was discontinued. The 1984 model deviated little from the 1983 model but featured a new paint scheme called \\"Galaxy Silver\\"; the original Firecracker Red scheme was still available. Revisions were minor and include a revised exhaust system and the addition of panels under the instrument cluster. Sales were now in direct competiotion to the smaller, lighter, water-cooled GPz900R model, which in 1984 would win first and second place in the 1300cc Production race at the Isle of Man TT.  Later models  In 1995, Kawasaki re-released the GPz brand, basing the motor on the ZZR-1100 water-cooled engines. There is no similarity between the later models (officially designated as ZX1100E) and any earlier models. This carbureted model was available from 1995 through 1997 in red or black and some came with rare factory ABS and/or saddlebags options.

It is the oldest continually operating ski resort in Southern California and is also one of four ski resorts in the San Bernardino National Forest. Originally named \\"Fish Camp\\" for the pond located in the area, the site was developed into a roadside resort and lumber mill in the 1920s by the Swetkowich brothers. In the 1930s the slopes were developed for tobogganing and skiing by the Arrowhead Springs Corporation, which named the development Snow Valley. The resort featured one of the first overhead cable ski lifts. In 1940 the resort was purchased by Norwegian-American ski jump champion Johnny Elvrum, who expanded it. In 1974 W.R. Sauey became the owner of Snow Valley. His company the Nordic Group owns and operates Snow Valley. The resort operates under Special Use Permit from the United States Forest Service.\\"About Us\\". Snow Valley Mountain Resort. Retrieved on 2010-12-31. Lifts Snow Valley Mountain Resort has a total of 13 functioning lifts as of the 2017-18 season. The beginner lift, lift 6, is 1,197 feet long and is a double chair lift. It leads to the easiest run in the resort, thunder mountain. A lift that is still a beginner's lift but a little more challenging is lift 13. This lift is 1,235 feet long and leads to three runs: coyote flats (natural snow only), eagle flats (also known as the Rim Progression Park), and the hardest run, Graduation. The previous main lift of the resort is lift 1, which is 4,701 feet long. It has a mid station that is right next to a restaurant called \\"Dear Meadow Grille\\". When at the top, it leads to moderate, advanced, and expert runs. When lift 1 is busy, another lift that goes a little lower than lift 1 is called lift 2. It goes 3,688 feet, and unloads skiers at a little hill called Race Peak. From here, there is one intermediate run, and 4 advanced runs. Most of these advanced runs are closed at the beginning and end of the season due to a lack of natural snow. Other than lifts 1 and 2, lift 3 serves as a lift which is on the other side of the mid station for lift 1. New for the 2017 season was the 'Snow Valley Express', Southern California's First High-Speed Detachable 6 Seat Lift.

URL : http://bcrfj.revues.org/index256.html The earliest pottery oven of its kind was excavated here; it had two chambers that allowed separation between the vessels being fired and the open flame. This type of pottery oven continued to be used in the region until the Roman period. A temple and an olive press were also uncovered. Town planning is clearly evident at the site. The western gate in the town wall was rebuilt several times during this period. The excavations indicate developing urbanization and the presence of new populations. However, the town was abandoned in the middle of the third millennium BCE, and remained so for approximately 600 years. In the Middle Bronze Age II, there was a small settlement on the site that used the remnants of the older town walls for protection. In the 1700s the population expanded and a new wall was built, but it enclosed a smaller area than the older city. The Late Bronze Age remains indicate that there was no major urban development during this period. = Iron Age = Tell el-Far'ah was an important town in the early Iron Age, the center of a network of villages, one of five such networks that make up the Israelite settlement, starting around 1200 BCE, in the highlands between Jerusalem and the Jezreel Valley. Excavations from the Iron Age levels have produced numerous artifacts, including various figurines, arrowheads, spindle whorls, a model sanctuary, and Four room houses. The figurines include cow heads, cows nursing calves, horses, tambourine players, and figurines representing Asherah.www.bibleinterp.com In the Bible The town of Tirzah is first mentioned in the Bible in the Book of Joshua, as having had a king whom the Israelites defeated. it is not mentioned again until after the period of the United Monarchy.

The car wandered through the Monumental Axis, stopping at the National Congress, where, around 14:30 hours UTC‚àí2 (2:30 pm), Rousseff and Temer were received by the President of that body, Jos√© Sarney. Former president Lula da Silva passes the presidential sash to Rousseff at parlatorium (speaker's platform) of the Planalto Palace. On the floor of the Chamber, both of them will sign a term agreeing with the demands of the office, and Rousseff will make her first speech as President. Prior to that, they will be sworn in, taking the oath of \\"maintaining, protecting and fulfilling the Federal Constitution, comply with the laws, promote the general welfare of the Brazilian people, sustain the unity, integrity and independence of Brazil\\". Around 16:00 hours UTC‚àí2 (4 p.m.), Rousseff and Temer will leave the Congress building towards the Pal√°cio do Planalto. At 16:30 hours UTC‚àí2 (4:30 pm), they will be welcomed at the presidential palace's ramp by the outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his wife. Traditionally, the outgoing vice President and his wife also greet the new President, but Jos√© Alencar is undergoing colorectal cancer treatment in S√£o Paulo's Hospital S√≠rio-Liban√™s and shall not attend the inauguration.\\"Vice deixa a UTI, mas n√£o vai √† posse\\".

In the parlor (speaker's platform), located in the outer area of the palace, overlooking the Three Powers Plaza, Lula will pass the presidential sash to Rousseff. Wearing the sash, Rousseff will be greeted by heads of state and other authorities in the palace's east wing. Around 17:00 hours UTC‚àí2 (5 p.m.), Rousseff will head to the parlor and make her first speech to the people as President. Then, Rousseff will induct her 37 ministers inside the palace. Once this stage of the ceremony has passed, Rousseff will offer a reception to foreign authorities that were sent to Brazil to witness her inauguration at about 18:30 hours UTC‚àí2 (6:30 pm). Each foreign authority will have the opportunity to speak with Rousseff for 30 seconds. =Concerts= The inaugural day featured concerts by five Brazilian female singers: Elba Ramalho, Fernanda Takai, Mart'n√°lia, Z√©lia Duncan, and Gaby Amarantos. According to the newspaper Di√°rio do Par√°, the Ministry of Culture chose these singers to represent all five regions of Brazil. \\"Gaby Amarantos embala a posse de Dilma\\". Di√°rio do Par√°.

Rio de Janeiro-born Z√©lia Duncan began her career in Bras√≠lia, while Elba Ramalho hails from Para√≠ba and Gaby Amarantos was born and raised in Par√°. Therefore, none of the singers hails from the Southern Region. Attendance Organisers expected over 70,000 people to attend the inaugural ceremony at the Monumental Axis. The attendance was expected to match that for Lula's first inauguration in 2003, which was attended by an estimated 70,000‚Äì120,000 people.

At the first event of the inauguration, an open car parade from the Cathedral of Bras√≠lia to the National Congress, 2,650 agents of the Military Police, Civil Police, Federal Police and Federal Highway Police were present. In Congress, where the handover took place, another thousand police and military officers guarded president-elect and guests. Of this total, about 400 were soldiers from the Army, Navy and Air Force.\\"Bras√≠lia blindada na festa de Dilma\\". Correio da Manh√£. Retrieved on 2010-12-31. . Throughout the parade, snipers were in strategic locations, including the roofs of public buildings, while highly trained dogs enhanced security on the sidewalks. To protect foreign representatives, including 25 heads of state or government, 650 men were deployed by the Federal Police. Rousseff's personal safety was ensured by 65 federal agents. At her request, the inner circle was formed by trained female agents, who formed a shield around her. None of the parliamentarians were allowed to bring guests of their own to the ceremony. The invitations are individual, and a map indicating the entrance which guests had to use to get into the plenary of the Chamber were attached to them. Unlike previous inaugural ceremonies, the guests had to go through metal detectors in order to gain access to the Congress, with the exception of Deputies, Senators and heads of state. Also as a security measure, the ceremonial body of the Senate called for the cancellation of guided tours around the premises of the building starting on December 29. Broadcast Rousseff's inauguration was broadcast nationally by all major television networks. In order to ensure that there would be no \\"blind spots\\" during the broadcast, organisers allowed helicopters from private TV networks to fly over the Monumental Axis, in addition to installing a TV Senado camera, equipped to capture images at long ranges, atop the 28th floor of the Senate Annex I building.

Coico (born February 26, 1956) is an American politician and academic. Coico was the twelfth president of City College of New York, from August 2010 until October 2016. A graduate of Brooklyn College 1976, Coico became the first City University of New York alumna appointed to head CCNY. Coico resigned on October 7, 2016, amidst federal and state investigations into her finances. Education and training Coico received a bachelor of science degree Brooklyn College of The City University of New York (CUNY), in 1976, and a doctorate from Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences (GSMS, formerly known as Cornell University Graduate School of Medical Sciences), in 1981. At GSMS, Coico worked as a student research assistant and studied with the known cell biologist Zbyszek Darzynkiewicz, a professor of biochemistry and researcher of cell differentiation and carcinogenesis, and flow cytometry techniques for characterizing epithelial differentiation. Coico also studied with Myron Melamed, a GSMC professor of biology and scientist with an international reputation, who had co-authored the seminal cytometry publication in Science, \\"Spectrophotometer: New Instruments for Ultra-rapid Cell Analysis,\\" with Louis Kamentsky of Columbia University's IBM Watson Laboratory and Marc E. Weksler, a professor of medicine and eventual Irving Sherwood Wright Professor of Geriatrics at Weill Cornell. In graduate school, Coico participated in faculty sponsored research in teaching laboratory settings, such as the Laboratory of Investigative Cytology and the Walker Laboratory in Rye, New York. From 1981 to 1983, Coico held post-doctoral researcher fellowships at GSMS-affiliated Sloan-Kettering Institute. Early career In 1985, Coico joined Cornell University Medical College and Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, as an instructor in the department of surgery; participating in research activities, and serving for brief periods as a higher education administrator. From 1986, Coico held the rank of assistant professor, associate professor from 1990, and clinical professor (additional faculty) from 1995 to 2004. =Overview of research activities= Upon completing postdoctoral training, Coico's stated interests were to study the use of flow cytometry to detect risks for colo- rectal cancer (1985), and the growth and differentiation of epithelial cells (1990). and wound repair (1999). In the mid-1980s, Coico joined a broad bench to bedside research team, spearheaded by the biomedical research scientist John M. Hefton, M.D., a pioneering skin grafting researcher and the innovator of new techniques for the treatment of burn victims. In 2009, she advised Human Ecology undergraduates conducting survey research on the effectiveness of campus-based alcohol education. =Beginning of administrative career= In addition to teaching, Coico served for one-year as Cornell Medical College associate dean to Donald A. Fischman, from 1996 to 1997, and GSMS senior associate dean of research, from March 1997, responsible for the coordinate of graduate fellowships. For a year, Coico held the positions of GSMS vice- provost of external affairs, government agencies, and professional associations, in 2003‚Äì2004, and she was briefly the director of Tri- Institutional MD-PhD Program, a cooperative alliance between Cornell University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Rockefeller University. While at Cornell, Coico was an outspoken critic of the process of faculty promotion to tenure. In 1999, Coico stated, \\"There needs to be some flexibility so you don't have arbitrary numbers determining somebody's career at an institution.\\" In July 2004, Coico left Cornell Medical College and GSMS to accept the position of dean of New York State College of Human Ecology, one of four the statutory colleges in the SUNY system, funded and supervised by New York State, and located on the campus of Cornell University. Staiano-Coico succeeded New York State College of Human Ecology Dean Patsy Brannon, whose term ended June 30, 2004. However, Coico's term was once again relatively brief, and according to The Cornell Daily Sun, she \\"stepped down suddenly\\" after less than three years on the job, in March 2007. Coico took a position as the provost and chief academic officer of Temple University, joining Temple's then-vice president of Human Resources Deborah Hartnett, who later retired from Temple in order to become Coico's chief of staff at The City College of New York. While at Temple, Coico served on the board of managers of the University City Science Center, each one-year, before leaving after a three-year stint to accepted her appointment as president at The City College of New York in 2010.\\"Temple University Provost Lisa Staiano-Coico Appointed President of The City College of New York\\" , CUNY Announcement, April 26, 2010 =The City College of New York presidency= In 2010, the City University of New York (CUNY) Board of Trustees ratified Coico to the position of 12th president of The City College of New York (CCNY), the oldest college in the system, amidst a stormy battle between CUNY and Italian-Americans over affirmative action. According to The New York Times, CUNY pointed to the two Italian-American College presidents to refute the biased claim‚ÄîRegina S. Peruggi at Kingsborough Community College, and Lisa Staiano-Coico at the university's flagship campus. Coico was appointed president five years into CUNY Chancellor Matthew Goldstein's 2005‚Äì2015 Decade of Science, a system-wide initiative to expand facilities and recruit faculty in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and eleven years into the university's reform efforts to raise academic standards based upon a 1998 Mayoral task force report, entitled \\"The City University of New York: An Institution Adrift.\\" Controversy According to an article published in The Campus, a 2016 study conducted by Harvard Graduate School of Education found professors at City College of New York \\"extremely dissatisfied\\". Controversy and unrest persisted throughout Coico's time as president. Protests erupted over the return of Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) to campus, employment, the sudden defunding of the CCNY's WHCR-FM, also known \\"The Voice of Harlem,\\" cafeteria closure due to health violations, and labor contracts. Coico's term as president saw high turnover among high level college administration, including five different individuals in CCNY's number- two position of provost in a six-year period.David W. Chen, A Divisive President at City College, and a Long List of Personal Expenses, New York Times (October 10, 2016). Students protested the president's actions on campus, and in Coico's hometown of Larchmont, New York. campus employment conditions and administrative closures of CCNY Student and Community Center in 2013, and CCNY Schiff House, alternately known as the Child Development And Family Services Center, in 2015. The annual 2016 April Fool's satirical issue of the student newspaper The Campus featured the article \\"Where's Lisa Coico?\\" In 2016, New York Times reported Coico was the subject of interest in federal and New York State investigations, following a report that the 21st Century Foundation‚Äîa nonprofit charity affiliated with The City College of New York‚Äîhad paid some of Coico's personal expenses upon her arrival in 2010, and the charity was then reimbursed over $150,000 by the Research Foundation of CUNY, which manages research funds for the entire university system. The scandal prompted Federal prosecutors to look into affiliated of The City College of New York, and charity funds spending attached to CUNY and CCNY, which Coico and others may have misused. After news of Coico's possible misuse of funds came to light, top CCNY and CUNY administrators defended Coico, However, a group of CCNY senior faculty, according to The Observer, made a plea for further investigation to then-Chancellor James Milliken‚Äîhimself a source of financial controversy after moving into an upper east side penthouse paid for by the public university system. CCNY senior faculty discovered money missing from the Martin and Toni Sosnoff Fund for the Arts‚Äîpart of the holdings of the City College 21st Century Foundation‚Äîwhich should have contained roughly $600,000 dollars, had just $76.00. The outrage prompted Milliken-enlisted Fredrick Shaffer, then-City University of New York general counsel and senior vice chancellor for legal affairs, to audit Coico's spending. Although Shaffer ruled out financial malfeasance, the Times provided evidence suggesting that a 2011 memo detailing Coico's reimbursements had been fabricated.  Resignations  Coico resigned on October 7, 2016, effective immediately, shortly after the New York Times approached the university about a memo of Coico's expenses which suggested tampering and prompted an investigation.David W. Chen, President of City College Quits Abruptly Amid Scrutiny of Her Finances, New York Times (October 8, 2016). Records showed Coico, who earned an annual salary of $400,000 dollars, withdrew money from the non-profit 21st Century Foundation in 2010 and 2011. Although Coico denied any \\"inappropriate use\\" of CCNY funds and stated in letters to students and faculty that college employees should \\"cooperate fully\\" with investigators. However, a subsequent report from the office of the New York State Inspector General pointed out the illegality of CUNY General Cousel's action to not report Coico's misconduct to the Inspector General. After Coico's departure, City University of New York board chairman Thompson stated in a letter to the New York State Inspector General that Coico had been directed by a \\"lawyer for the university\\" to reimburse funds she misused from the City College 21st Century Foundation, although the college subsequently \\"discovered that in fact she did not return all the funds, despite her representations to the contrary.\\" Board chair Thompson asked for a state review of every CUNY-affiliated foundation, citing concerns about the lack of oversight over spending. At Thompson's behest, an investigation spearheaded by New York State Inspector General Catherine Leahy Scott issued a report (which the I.G.'s office called an \\"interim review\\") in November 2016, citing \\"shoddy oversight and ineffective management\\" at the City University of New York had created a system \\"ripe for abuse\\" that had possibly siphoned away money from needy students and crucial campus projects.David W. Chen, Lapses by CUNY Officials Made System 'Ripe for Abuse,' Report Says, New York Times (November 16, 2016). Following the release of the I.G.'s report, Governor Andrew Cuomo vowed to appoint an Inspector General to both CUNY and SUNY and called for new leadership at both institutions. Earlier, Governor Cuomo had replaced most of CUNY's trustees, including chairman Benno C. Schmidt Jr., naming a new chairman, Bill Thompson, former New York City Comptroller; Fernando Ferrer, former Bronx Borough President; Robert F. Mujica, the governor's budget director and a longtime top aide for the Senate Republican majority; Ken Sunshine, a public relations consultant; and Mayra Linares-Garcia, Cuomo's former director of Latino affairs and the daughter of Guillermo Linares, former NYC assemblyman and city councilman, and head of the state Higher Education Services Corporation. In a letter addressed to James Milliken, on November 18, 2016, written by Elkan Abramovitz, Coico's lawyer, which was published in the New York Times, Coico accused CUNY administrators of making her the scapegoat for the university's poor fiscal practices. In February 2017, CUNY Board of Trustees approved setting aside $25,000, in accordance with university practices, for each college president, or department dean, who might need to hire an attorney when being interviewed by I.G. Leahy Scott's investigators. Following Coico's departure, CCNY and CUNY top officials left in the wake of investigations targeting university-wide financial practices. After Coico, Maurizio Trevisan resigned from the position as Provost of City College of New York, after occupying the number-two position under Coico. Since, other resignations included Allan H. Dobrin, from the position of Executive Vice Chancellor and Chief Operating Officer; Gillian Small, former CUNY Vice Chancellor for Research; and Frederick P. Schaffer, who retired from the position of CUNY Vice Chancellor for Legal Affairs and General Counsel. Jay Hershenson, who was demoted from Senior Vice Chancellor of University Relations to a vice-president at Queens College, was criticized for his spending practices while the university is in financial trouble. At the close of 2017, CUNY Chancellor James B. Milliken announced he was stepping down, after only three-years on the job. In 2018, two years after Coico resigned amidst ongoing federal and state probes, the inspector general continued to identify and investigate the university's corrupt spending practices. = Corporate affiliations = In 1996, Coico established an employment relationship with Ortec International Incorporated, a New York City biotechnology company, later renamed Forticell Bioscience, Incorporated. Coico assisted in the development of the company's composite cultured skin product, along with Cocio's Cornell colleague, Suzanne Schwartz, hired full-time in July 1996. The founder, Steven Katz, was elected board chair in 1994; Katz had been a professor of Economics and Finance at Baruch College/CUNY from 1972. Coico joined the company advisory board in 1999. Forticell Bioscience, Incorporated is a publicly traded company that developed proprietary and patented technology to stimulate the repair and regeneration of human tissue, including biologically active wound dressings, such as the tissue engineered product OrCel (trademark sign), to stimulate the repair and regeneration of human skin on burn patients, and other wound healing products, relevant to reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.

He used his entire fortune worth about two trillion won (1.7 billion dollars) in today's value to fight against the Japanese occupation of Korea. He is the elder brother of Lee Si-Yeong, future Vice President of the Republic of Korea. Born in a renowned noble family, GyeongJu Lee Clan, in which his ancestors were appointed governmental officials during the Joseon Dynasty, he and his brothers (with the exception of his eldest brother) decided to flee Korea, rather than to become subjects of oppression.

Lee was arrested upon arrival from Shanghai at Dalian, and later imprisoned in the infamous Lushun Prison until his death. He died on November 17, 1932. The cause of his death was a mystery, and the Japanese authority claims that he had hanged himself on the window bars of a police station, using a hemp cloth. The Japanese' claim was refuted by Koreans, who claimed Lee was killed by the Japanese. Upon his death, his remains was cremated on the same day; his ashes was later brought back to Japanese-occupied Korea. His remains were last re-interred at Seoul National Cemetery, years after Korean independence. Lee was posthumously awarded with the Order of Merit for National Foundation in 1962. In 2000, the Chinese government proclaimed him as a \\"Patriotic martyr of the anti- imperialism/anti-Japanese revolution\\" for his struggle against Japanese imperialism in China.

SUD-Net plans to ‚Äúcontribute to livable, productive and inclusive cities which embrace social harmony, economic vitality and environmental sustainability‚Ä¶‚Äù  Main Activities  Some of their main activities SUD-Net focuses on include but are not limited to: Building partnerships and synergy; build a network of partners; introduce new ideas through the utilization of demonstrations; encourage education and an exchange of new ideas and actions. They hope with the application of these ideals they will be able to achieve a ‚Äúclear focus on [a] local level‚Äù. A key partnership SUD-Net has been able to attain is the ‚ÄúCities in Climate Change Initiative, or CCCI. CCCI has a similar main goal as SUD-Net‚Äîwhich is to‚Äî‚Äúenhance climate change mitigation and adaptation of cities in developing and least developing countries‚Äù. They also have paired with the Habitat Partner University Collaboration‚ÄîHPU‚Äîto create an alliance with higher education establishments to help inform about the sustainability in urban development. SUD-Net is able to retain its growing community and implement its goals by drawing from an array of pre-existing resources as well as partners. The Sustainable Urban Development Network has networking both locally and globally which allows them to have access to more programs that also plan to help urbanize sustainability. In all SUD-Net plans to achieve ‚Äúcollaborative activities to generate a coherent approach to sustainable urban designs and systems for improving basic infrastructure services‚Äù .  Areas of Focus  SUD-Net has several primary concentrations at this point, these consist of: ‚Äúgovernance; environmental planning and management; urban economy; education, training and research, and; urban planning‚Äù Within these primary concentrations they have a priority point of entry. For governance their entry point is Decentralization. SUD-net hopes to implement as well as improve the guidelines for decentralization and to provide a better representation of the population in municipal decision-making at all levels. Climate change proves to be the point of entry for environmental planning and management thematic focus. SUD- Net as well as the CCCI have paired together to help the extenuation as well as the preparedness of climate change attributes. They hope to reduce national poverty and help support the growth of pro-poor initiative at a local level. The thematic focus of urban economy has a point of entry at the development of the economy at a localized level. In order to create and uphold sustainable cities local key-players will carry a heavier load of responsibilities. SUD- Net helps to boost this capacity of responsibilities by mainstreaming developmental strategies as well as provide a network of tools to create a support system to the local government; by doing so they hope to resolve issues in urban planning and management, i.e. strategies to sanitation, roads, energy, help with housing programs, as well as accessibility to clean water, and lastly an educational network. The overall goal is to stimulate as well as sustain the economy and to help develop productive, livable communities. HPU (Human Partner Universities) helps stimulate education in addition to training and research for the community. The goal of HPU in partnership with SUD-Net is to provide higher education for sustainable urbanization and introduce complex problems to gain perspective. HPU offers these programs to provide access of education along with resources to policy-makers and communities alike to deliver an interaction between them and said universities to continue research agendas. Urban planning looks to gain participation of urban planning and management as a point of entry. To do so SUD-Net plans to unite legal frameworks for human settlements development to planning and management strategies of urban areas and participation of such practices. SUD-Net will provide technical assistance along with contact to networks of planning associations/ planning approaches to governments at a local and national level in developing countries. This will allow these countries to strive toward implementing sustainable urban plans and designs that encourage its communities‚Äô participation. Skyline of Moscow. SUD-Net aims to work directly with cities like this in order to conduct productive and sustainable urban planning  Urban Environmental Planning  = Communities and Climate Change = SUD-Net and its partner Cities and Climate Change Initiative (CCCI) recognize the vital role of communities in both the contribution to and the mitigation of climate change. It is a growing public concern and in the 1990s became an issue of policy at the Rio Earth Summit. In order to evaluate urban contributions and efforts to ameliorate their relationship with the natural world, these concentrated centers of population have had to learn how to plan, implement, and measure the successes and failures of their respective projects. = Planning Methods and Conflicts = It is common for local governments to utilize special planning for the development of their industry and commerce, as well as their residential growth. They first consider what they need, or the areas that they have available, and then decide where to build or what to build in order to benefit the largest number of people and interests. This is in contrast to environmental planning which considers the quality of the environment for the residents, and protects these areas from developments that would damage it. = Integrated Environmental Zoning (Dutch model) = In an effort to simplify the process for permitting and land use, the Dutch government combined the agencies that were each responsible for air, water and soil pollution assessment (Environmental Protection Act of 1980). Further legislation switched the focus from threat analysis to environmental protection (National Environmental Management Act). The Netherlands have received attention for their plan to control all of their environmental issues within twenty-five years. This mode of assessment has uncovered conditions that are unacceptable according to the program criteria, and the cost of remediation has been prohibitive. There have been concerns over the inflexibility of the assessments and today‚Äôs environmental policy is considering incorporating flexibility criteria to compensate for the costs, without compromising on the environmental standard goals. = Partnerships = SUD-Net, in an effort to enable global, regional, national, and local leaders, has sought to commence and strengthen relationships that support urban development. SUD-Net enters into agreements with its members to communicate within a standard while using current ways to deal with urban issues. The Regional Technical Cooperation Division (RTCD) offices are tasked with creating Regional Working Groups, initiating agreements to be ratified by SUD- Net administrators. Access to SUD-Net is voluntary and happens through an Urban Gateway.  Mission  SUD-Net aims to improve the resources available for entities ranging from national to local governments to assist in the efforts to cultivate productive, sustainable urban cities. The organization seeks to improve social equity, social resilience, economic development, and the quality of urban environments all over the world. Through the use of urban and environmental planning, SUD-Net intends to help local decision makers mitigate the effects of urbanization on climate change and support poverty reduction strategies. The consequences that are linked with growing populations in cities are known, however, many government and local decision makers in developing and semi-developing countries still remain unaware of the strategies and resources that can be used to implement sustainable urban development policies. SUD-Net seeks to address this issue with the use of furthering education about sustainable urban planning and provide access to tools and communication networks to further enhance the resources for cities to practice good, sustainable habits. With these goals in mind, UN-HABITAT and SUD-Net provide a coordinated global portal through which urban decision makers can access information and resources, interact, and cooperatively engage through the SUD-Net partnerships and access to basket funding. Within UN-HABITAT, SUD-Net joins existing initiatives while also strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration on sustainable development issues. SUD-Net is recognized as one of the targeted ongoing actions for advancing the Global Campaign for Sustainable Urbanization that will enable cities to make more sustainable decisions.  Initiatives and Projects  = The Cities and Climate Change Initiative (CCCI) = Formally launched at an international conference in Oslo, Norway on 17 March 2009. The conference took place with two main goals in mind: integrating the principles of sustainable development into policies and programs and reversing the loss of natural resources in developing countries through the promotion of resilience to climate change. The main objectives of the conference were to officially launch the CCCI and share experiences on how to address the CCCI in both developing and developed countries. About 100 participants from the countries of the Philippines, Uganda, Mozambique, and Mexico were all in attendance. The issue of climate change is a key mandate connected with SUD-Net. The network places a strong emphasis on local urban planning and enhancing the competence of cities in the subject of global climate change. = Cape Town SUD-Net Workshop = Took place in Cape Town, South Africa on 17‚Äì19 February 2009. The topic of the workshop was how to promote sustainable urban development networking in African cities. Prior to the conference, five pilot cities in Africa were added to the Cities and Climate Change Initiative (CCCI), which continued to fulfill the major goal of SUD-Net that is strengthening the voices of urban dynamics for developing cities. Major objectives of the workshop were to identify and strengthen urban planning networks in Africa and identify any possible weaknesses or gaps in the plan, share experiences, define SUD-Net‚Äôs role in the Africa region in the promotion of urban planning and management, and to officially launch the SUD-Net Africa regional network. The countries of Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe were all in attendance. 41 participants were present at the workshop.

The Chan School was strongly influenced by Taoist philosophy, especially Neo-Daoist thought, and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Ch√°n spread south to Vietnam and became Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn, northeast to Korea to become Seon Buddhism, and east to Japan, becoming Japanese Zen. The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word Á¶™ (ch√°n), an abbreviation of Á¶™ÈÇ£ (ch√°nn√†), which is a Chinese transliteration of the Sanskrit word of dhyƒÅna (\\"meditation\\"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-restraint, meditation-practice, insight into the nature of mind (Ë¶ãÊÄß, Ch. ji√†nx√¨ng, Jp. kensho, \\"perceiving the true nature\\") and nature of things, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de- emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through spiritual practice and interaction with an accomplished teacher or Master. The teachings of Zen include various sources of MahƒÅyƒÅna thought, especially Yogachara, the TathƒÅgatagarbha s≈´tras, the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ literature as well as Madhyamaka thought have also been influential in the shaping of the apophatic and sometimes iconoclastic nature of Zen rhetoric.Andre van der Braak (2011), Self Overcoming Without a Self, p.117 Etymology The word Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation (kana: „Åú„Çì) of the Middle Chinese word Á¶™ (IPA: ; pinyin: Ch√°n), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word dhyƒÅna (‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®),, which can be approximately translated as \\"absorption\\" or \\"meditative state\\". The actual Chinese term for the \\"Zen school\\" is Á¶™ÂÆó Ch√°nz≈çng, while \\"Chan\\" just refers to the practice of meditation itself (ÁøíÁ¶™Ôºåx√≠ch√°n) or the study of meditation (Á¶™Â≠∏Ôºåch√°nxu√©) though it is often used as an abbreviated form of Ch√°nzong. Practice = DhyƒÅna = The practice of dhyana or meditation, especially sitting meditation (ÂùêÁ¶™ÔºåChinese: zu√≤ch√°n, Japanese: zazen / „Åñ„Åú„Çì) is a central part of Zen Buddhism. Chinese Buddhism The practice of Buddhist meditation first entered China through the translations of An Shigao (fl. c. 148‚Äì180 CE), and KumƒÅrajƒ´va (334‚Äì413 CE), who both translated DhyƒÅna sutras, which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara (yoga praxis) teachings of the Kashmiri SarvƒÅstivƒÅda circa 1st‚Äì4th centuries CE.Deleanu, Florin (1992); Mindfulness of Breathing in the DhyƒÅna S≈´tras. Transactions of the International Conference of Orientalists in Japan (TICOJ) 37, 42‚Äì57. Among the most influential early Chinese meditation texts include the Anban Shouyi Jing (ÂÆâËà¨ÂÆàÊÑèÁ∂ì, Sutra on ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasm·πõti), the Zuochan Sanmei Jing (ÂùêÁ¶™‰∏âÊòßÁ∂ìÔºåSutra of sitting dhyƒÅna samƒÅdhi) and the Damoduoluo Chan Jing (ÈÅîÊë©Â§öÁæÖÁ¶™Á∂ìÔºå Dharmatrata dhyƒÅna sutra). These early Chinese meditation works continued to exert influence on Zen practice well into the modern era. For example, the 18th century Rinzai Zen master T≈çrei Enji wrote a commentary on the Damoduoluo Chan Jing and used the Zuochan Sanmei Jing as source in the writing of this commentary. T≈çrei believed that the Damoduoluo Chan Jing had been authored by Bodhidharma.Mohr, Michel. 2006.

While dhyƒÅna in a strict sense refers to the four dhyƒÅnas, in Chinese Buddhism, dhyƒÅna may refer to various kinds of meditation techniques and their preparatory practices, which are necessary to practice dhyƒÅna. The five main types of meditation in the DhyƒÅna sutras are ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasm·πõti (mindfulness of breathing); pa·π≠ik≈´lamanasikƒÅra meditation (mindfulness of the impurities of the body); maitrƒ´ meditation (loving-kindness); the contemplation on the twelve links of pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda; and contemplation on the Buddha.Ven. Dr. Yuanci, A Study of the Meditation Methods in the DESM and Other Early Chinese Texts, The Buddhist Academy of China. According to the modern Chan master Sheng Yen, these practices are termed the \\"five methods for stilling or pacifying the mind\\" and serve to focus and purify the mind, and support the development of the stages of dhyana.Zhang, Shengyen; Dan Stevenson (2002). Hoofprint of the Ox: Principles of the Chan Buddhist Path as Taught by a Modern Chinese Master. Oxford University Press, pp. 27‚Äì28. Chan also shares the practice of the four foundations of mindfulness and the Three Gates of Liberation (emptyness or ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, signlessness or animitta, and wishlessness or apra·πáihita) with early Buddhism and classic Mahayana.Zhang, Shengyen; Dan Stevenson (2002). Hoofprint of the Ox: Principles of the Chan Buddhist Path as Taught by a Modern Chinese Master. Oxford University Press, pp. 29‚Äì30. Pointing to the nature of the mind According to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Ch√°n, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as Buddha-nature.Luk, Charles. The Secrets of Chinese Meditation. 1964. p. 44 According to Luk, this method is referred to as the \\"Mind Dharma\\", and exemplified in the story (in the Flower Sermon) of ≈öƒÅkyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa smiling as he understood. A traditional formula of this is, \\"Ch√°n points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas.\\"Nan, Huai-Chin. Basic Buddhism: Exploring Buddhism and Zen. 1997. p. 92 Observing the mind According to John R. McRae the \\"first explicit statement of the sudden and direct approach that was to become the hallmark of Ch'an religious practice\\" is associated with the East Mountain School. It is a method named \\"Maintaining the one without wavering\\" (shou-i pu i, ÂÆà‰∏Ä‰∏çÁßª), the one being the nature of mind, which is equated with Buddha- nature. According to Sharf, in this practice, one turns the attention from the objects of experience, to the nature of mind, the perceiving subject itself, which is equated with Buddha-nature. According to McRae, this type of meditation resembles the methods of \\"virtually all schools of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism,\\" but differs in that \\"no preparatory requirements, no moral prerequisites or preliminary exercises are given,\\" and is \\"without steps or gradations. One concentrates, understands, and is enlightened, all in one undifferentiated practice.\\" Sharf notes that the notion of \\"Mind\\" came to be criticised by radical subitists, and was replaced by \\"No Mind,\\" to avoid any reifications. Meditation manuals Early Chan texts also teach forms of meditation that are unique to MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism, for example, the Treatise on the Essentials of Cultivating the Mind, which depicts the teachings of the 7th-century East Mountain school teaches a visualization of a sun disk, similar to that taught in the Sutra of the Contemplation of the Buddha Amit√°yus. Later Chinese Buddhists developed their own meditation manuals and texts, one of the most influential being the works of the Tiantai patriarch, Zhiyi. His works seemed to have exerted some influence on the earliest meditation manuals of the Ch√°n school proper, an early work being the widely imitated and influential Tso-chan-i (Principles of sitting meditation, c. 11th century).Gregory, Peter N; Ch 'ang-lu Tsung-tse and Zen Meditation in 'Traditions of Meditation in Chinese Buddhism'. = Common contemporary meditation forms = Mindfulness of breathing Venerable Hsuan Hua meditating in the lotus position, Hong Kong, 1953 The 'meditation hall' (Jp. zend≈ç, Ch. ch√°nt√°ng) of Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-Ji During sitting meditation (ÂùêÁ¶Ö, Ch. zu√≤ch√°n, Jp. zazen, Ko. jwaseon), practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza, often using the dhyƒÅna mudrƒÅ. Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. To regulate the mind, Zen students are often directed towards counting breaths. Either both exhalations and inhalations are counted, or one of them only. The count can be up to ten, and then this process is repeated until the mind is calmed.Katsuki Sekida, Zen Training: Methods and Philosophy, Shambhala Publications, 2005, p. 60. Zen teachers like Omori Sogen teach a series of long and deep exhalations and inhalations as a way to prepare for regular breath meditation.Omori Sogen, Introduction To Zen Training, Routledge, 2012, p. 49. Attention is usually placed on the energy center (dantian) below the navel. Zen teachers often promote diaphragmatic breathing, stating that the breath must come from the lower abdomen (known as hara or tanden in Japanese), and that this part of the body should expand forward slightly as one breathes.Katsuki Sekida, Zen Training: Methods and Philosophy, Shambhala Publications, 2005, p. 61. Over time the breathing should become smoother, deeper and slower.Taizan Maezumi, Bernie Glassman (editors) On Zen Practice: Body, Breath, and Mind, pp. 41‚Äì42. When the counting becomes an encumbrance, the practice of simply following the natural rhythm of breathing with concentrated attention is recommended.Katsuki Sekida, Zen Training: Methods and Philosophy, Shambhala Publications, 2005, p. 64.Kapleau, P. The Three Pillars of Zen, 2013, p. 12.  Silent Illumination and shikantaza  A common form of sitting meditation is called \\"Silent illumination\\" (Ch. m√≤zh√†o, Jp. mokush≈ç). This practice was traditionally promoted by the Caodong school of Chinese Chan and is associated with Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091‚Äî1157) who wrote various works on the practice.Taigen Dan Leighton. Cultivating the Empty Field: The Silent Illumination of Zen Master Hongzhi, Tuttle, 2000, p. 17 This method derives from the Indian Buddhist practice of the union (Skt. yuganaddha) of ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ.Sheng Yen, John Hurrell Crook, Shengyan, Illuminating Silence: The Practice of Chinese Zen, Watkins Publishing,, 2002, p. 93. In Hongzhi's practice of \\"nondual objectless meditation\\" the mediator strives to be aware of the totality of phenomena instead of focusing on a single object, without any interference, conceptualizing, grasping, goal seeking, or subject-object duality.Taigen Dan Leighton. Cultivating the Empty Field: The Silent Illumination of Zen Master Hongzhi, Tuttle, 2000, pp. 1‚Äì2. This practice is also popular in the major schools of Japanese Zen, but especially S≈çt≈ç, where it is more widely known as Shikantaza (Ch. zh«êgu«én d«ézu√≤, \\"Just sitting\\"). Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of the practice can be found throughout the work of the Japanese S≈çt≈ç Zen thinker D≈çgen, especially in his Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, for example in the \\"Principles of Zazen\\" and the \\"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\\". While the Japanese and the Chinese forms are similar, they are distinct approaches.Zhang, Shengyen; Dan Stevenson (2002). Hoofprint of the Ox: Principles of the Chan Buddhist Path as Taught by a Modern Chinese Master. Oxford University Press, p. 152. Hua Tou and K≈çan contemplation Mu\\" () by Torei Enji. It figures in the famous Zhaozhou's dog k≈çan During the Tang dynasty, g≈çng'√†n (Jp. k≈çan) literature became popular. Literally meaning \\"public case\\", they were stories or dialogues, describing teachings and interactions between Zen masters and their students. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. K≈çan are meant to illustrate the non-conceptual insight (praj√±a) that the Buddhist teachings point to. During the S√≤ng dynasty, a new meditation method was popularized by figures such as Dahui, which was called kanhua chan (\\"observing the phrase\\" meditation), which referred to contemplation on a single word or phrase (called the huatou, \\"critical phrase\\") of a g≈çng'√†n. In Chinese Chan and Korean Seon, this practice of \\"observing the huatou\\" (hwadu in Korean) is a widely practiced method.Buswell, Robert E. (1991). Tracing Back the Radiance: Chinul's Korean Way of Zen (Classics in East Asian Buddhism). University of Hawaii Press. pp. 68‚Äì69. . It was taught by the influential Seon master Chinul (1158‚Äì1210), and modern Chinese masters like Sheng Yen and Xuyun. Yet, while Dahui famously criticised \\"silent illumination,\\" he nevertheless \\"did not completely condemn quiet-sitting; in fact, he seems to have recommended it, at least to his monastic disciples.\\" In the Japanese Rinzai school, k≈çan introspection developed its own formalized style, with a standardized curriculum of k≈çans, which must be studied and \\"passed\\" in sequence. This process includes standardized \\"checking questions\\" (sassho) and common sets of \\"capping phrases\\" (jakugo) or poetry citations that are memorized by students as answers.Bodiford, William M. (2006). Koan practice. In: \\"Sitting with Koans\\". Ed. John Daido Loori. Somerville, MA: Wisdom Publications, p. 94. The Zen student's mastery of a given k≈çan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as dokusan, daisan, or sanzen). While there is no unique answer to a k≈çan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their spiritual understanding through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation. K≈çan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), kinhin (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. The goal of the practice is often termed kensho (seeing one's true nature), and is to be followed by further practice to attain a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the \\"ultimate liberation\\", \\"knowing without any kind of defilement\\". K≈çan practice is particularly emphasized in Rinzai, but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.  Nianfo chan  Nianfo (Jp. nembutsu, from Skt. buddhƒÅnusm·πõti \\"recollection of the Buddha\\") refers to the recitation of the Buddha's name, in most cases the Buddha Amitabha. In Chinese Chan, the Pure Land practice of nianfo based on the phrase NƒÅm√≥ ƒÄm√≠tu√≥f√≥ (Homage to Amitabha) is a widely practiced form of Zen meditation. This practice was adopted from Pure land Buddhism and syncretized with Chan meditation by Chinese figures such as Yongming Yanshou, Zhongfen Mingben, and Tianru Weize. During the late Ming, the harmonization of Pure land practices with Chan meditation was continued by figures such as Yunqi Zhuhong and Hanshan Deqing. This practice, as well as its adaptation into the \\"nembutsu k≈çan\\" was also used by the Japanese ≈åbaku school of Zen. = Bodhisattva virtues and vows = Victoria Zen Centre Jukai ceremony, January 2009 Since Zen is a form of Mahayana Buddhism, it is grounded on the schema of the bodhisattva path, which is based on the practice of the \\"transcendent virtues\\" or \\"perfections\\" (Skt. pƒÅramitƒÅ, Ch. b≈çlu√≥m√¨, Jp. baramitsu) as well as the taking of the bodhisattva vows.Aitken, Robert, The Practice of Perfection: The Paramitas from a Zen Buddhist Perspective, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2012.Shohaku Okumura, Living by Vow: A Practical Introduction to Eight Essential Zen Chants and Texts, Simon and Schuster, 2012, p. 15. The most widely used list of six virtues is: generosity, moral training (incl. five precepts), patient endurance, energy or effort, meditation (dhyana), wisdom. An important source for these teachings is the Avatamsaka sutra, which also outlines the grounds (bhumis) or levels of the bodhisattva path.Sheng Yen, Shengyan, Dharma Drum: The Life and Heart of Chan Practice, Shambhala Publications, 2006. The pƒÅramitƒÅs are mentioned in early Chan works such as Bodhidharma's Two entrances and four practices and are seen as an important part of gradual cultivation (jianxiu) by later Chan figures like Zongmi.Jeffrey Lyle Broughton, Zongmi on Chan, p. 171. An important element of this practice is the formal and ceremonial taking of refuge in the three jewels, bodhisattva vows and precepts. Various sets of precepts are taken in Zen including the five precepts, \\"ten essential precepts\\", and the sixteen bodhisattva precepts.Kenji Matsuo, A History of Japanese Buddhism, Global Oriental, 2007, p. 32.Baroni, Helen J. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, p. 93.Borup, Jorn, Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism, BRILL, 2008, p. 247. This is commonly done in an initiation ritual (Ch. sh√≤u ji√®, Jp. Jukai, Ko. sugye, \\"receiving the precepts\\"), which is also undertaken by lay followers and marks a layperson as a formal Buddhist.Ling, Haicheng (2004). Buddhism in China. Chinese Intercontinental Press, p. 184. The Chinese Buddhist practice of fasting (zhai), especially during the uposatha days (Ch. zhairi, \\"days of fasting\\") can also be an element of Chan training.Zhang, Shengyen; Dan Stevenson (2002). Hoofprint of the Ox: Principles of the Chan Buddhist Path as Taught by a Modern Chinese Master. Oxford University Press, p. 56. Chan masters may go on extended absolute fasts, as exemplified by master Hsuan Hua's 35 day fast, which he undertook during the Cuban missile crisis for the generation of merit.Asian American Religious Cultures [2 volumes], edited by Jonathan H. X. Lee, Fumitaka Matsuoka, Edmond Yee, Ronald Y. Nakasone, ABC-CLIO, 2015, p. 470. =Physical cultivation= Two grandmasters of the Shaolin Temple of Chinese Chan, Shi DeRu and Shi DeYang Traditional martial arts, like Japanese archery, other forms of Japanese bud≈ç and Chinese martial arts (g≈çngfu) have also been seen as forms of zen praxis. This tradition goes back to the influential Shaolin Monastery in Henan, which developed the first institutionalized form of g≈çngfu.Christensen, Matthew B. A Geek in China: Discovering the Land of Alibaba, Bullet Trains and Dim Sum. Tuttle Publishing. p. 40. . By the late Ming, Shaolin g≈çngfu was very popular and widespread, as evidenced by mentions in various forms of Ming literature (featuring staff wielding fighting monks like Sun Wukong) and historical sources, which also speak of Shaolin's impressive monastic army that rendered military service to the state in return for patronage.Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, University of Hawaii Press, 2008, p. 55, 80. These Shaolin practices, which began to develop around the 12th century, were also traditionally seen as a form of Chan Buddhist inner cultivation (today called wuchan, \\"martial chan\\"). The Shaolin arts also made use of Taoist physical exercises (taoyin) breathing and energy cultivation (q√¨g≈çng) practices.Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, University of Hawaii Press, 2008, p. 2.Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, University of Hawaii Press, 2008, pp. 80, 144. They were seen as therapeutic practices, which improved \\"internal strength\\" (neili), health and longevity (lit. \\"nourishing life\\" yangsheng), as well as means to spiritual liberation.Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, University of Hawaii Press, 2008, pp. 147. The influence of these Taoist practices can be seen in the work of Wang Zuyuan (ca. 1820‚Äìafter 1882), a scholar and minor bureaucrat who studied at Shaolin. Wang's Illustrated Exposition of Internal Techniques (Neigong tushuo) shows how Shaolin exercises were drawn from Taoist methods like those of the Yi jin jing and Eight pieces of brocade, possibly influenced by the Ming dynasty's spirit of religious syncretism.Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, University of Hawaii Press, 2008, p. 138, 173. According to the modern Chan master Sheng Yen, Chinese Buddhism has adopted internal cultivation exercises from the Shaolin tradition as ways to \\"harmonize the body and develop concentration in the midst of activity.\\" This is because, \\"techniques for harmonizing the vital energy are powerful assistants to the cultivation of samadhi and spiritual insight.\\"Zhang, Shengyen; Dan Stevenson (2002). Hoofprint of the Ox: Principles of the Chan Buddhist Path as Taught by a Modern Chinese Master. Oxford University Press, pp. 34‚Äì35. Korean Seon also has developed a similar form of active physical training, termed Sunmudo. Engaku-ji temple, the temple also has a D≈çj≈ç for the practice of Ky≈´d≈ç and the Zen priests practice this art here.Hideharu Onuma, Dan DeProspero, Jackie DeProspero (1993) \\"Kyudo: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery,\\" p. ix, Kodansha International. In Japan, the classic combat arts (bud≈ç) and zen practice have been in contact since the embrace of Rinzai Zen by the H≈çj≈ç clan in the 13th century, who applied zen discipline to their martial practice.Mann, Jeffrey, When Buddhists Attack: The Curious Relationship Between Zen and the Martial Arts, p. 61. One influential figure in this relationship was the Rinzai priest Takuan S≈çh≈ç who was well known for his writings on zen and bud≈ç addressed to the samurai class (especially his The Unfettered Mind) .Takuan Soho, The Unfettered Mind: Writings from a Zen Master to a Master Swordsman, p. xv. The Rinzai school also adopted certain Taoist energy practices. They were introduced by Hakuin (1686‚Äì1769) who learned various techniques from a hermit named Hakuyu who helped Hakuin cure his \\"Zen sickness\\" (a condition of physical and mental exhaustion).Waddell, Norman (ed. & trans.), Hakuin's Precious Mirror Cave: A Zen Miscellany, 2009, p. 83. These energetic practices, known as Naikan, are based on focusing the mind and one's vital energy (ki) on the tanden (a spot slightly below the navel).Julian Daizan Skinner (2017), \\"Practical Zen: Meditation and Beyond,\\" pp. 203-204. Singing DragonHakuin Ekaku (2010), \\"Wild Ivy: The Spiritual Autobiography of Zen Master Hakuin\\", p. 150. Shambhala Publications = The arts = Hakuin Ekaku, Hotei in a Boat, Yale University Art Gallery The kare- sansui (dry landscape) zen garden at Ry≈çan-ji Certain arts such as painting, calligraphy, poetry, gardening, flower arrangement, tea ceremony and others have also been used as part of zen training and practice. Classical Chinese arts like brush painting and calligraphy were used by Chan monk painters such as Guanxiu and Muqi Fachang to communicate their spiritual understanding in unique ways to their students.Stephen Addiss, John Daido Loori, The Zen Art Book: The Art of Enlightenment, p. 1. Zen paintings are sometimes termed zenga in Japanese.Stephen Addiss, John Daido Loori, The Zen Art Book: The Art of Enlightenment, p. 4. Hakuin is one Japanese Zen master who was known to create a large corpus of unique sumi-e (ink and wash paintings) and Japanese calligraphy to communicate zen in a visual way. His work and that of his disciples were widely influential in Japanese Zen.Stephen Addiss, John Daido Loori, The Zen Art Book: The Art of Enlightenment, p. 15. Another example of Zen arts can be seen in the short lived Fuke sect of Japanese Zen, which practiced a unique form of \\"blowing zen\\" (suizen) by playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute. =Intensive group practice= Intensive group meditation may be practiced by serious Zen practitioners. In the Japanese language, this practice is called sesshin. While the daily routine may require monks to meditate for several hours each day, during the intensive period they devote themselves almost exclusively to zen practice. The numerous 30‚Äì50 minute long sitting meditation (zazen) periods are interwoven with rest breaks, ritualized formal meals (Jp. oryoki), and short periods of work (Jp. samu) that are to be performed with the same state of mindfulness. In modern Buddhist practice in Japan, Taiwan, and the West, lay students often attend these intensive practice sessions or retreats. These are held at many Zen centers or temples. =Zen chanting and rituals= Chanting the Buddhist Scriptures, by Taiwanese painter Li Mei-shu Gifu Daibutsu and altar at Sh≈çh≈ç-ji Monks chanting the \\"Heart Sutra\\" in S≈çji-ji Temple in Yokohama, Japan Most Zen monasteries, temples and centers perform various rituals, services and ceremonies (such as initiation ceremonies and funerals), which are always accompanied by the chanting of verses, poems or sutras.Shohaku Okumura, Living by Vow: A Practical Introduction to Eight Essential Zen Chants and Texts, Simon and Schuster, 2012, p. 1. There are also ceremonies that are specifically for the purpose of sutra recitation (Ch. niansong, Jp. nenju) itself.Steven Heine, Dale S. Wright (editors), Zen Ritual: Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice, Oxford University Press, USA, 2008, p. 127. Zen schools may have an official sutra book that collects these writings (in Japanese, these are called kyohon). Practitioners may chant major Mahayana sutras such as the Heart Sutra and chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra (often called the \\"Avalokite≈õvara Sutra\\"). DhƒÅra·πáƒ´s and Zen poems may also be part of a Zen temple liturgy, including texts like the Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi, the Sandokai, the Nƒ´laka·πá·π≠ha DhƒÅra·πáƒ´, and the U·π£·πáƒ´·π£a Vijaya DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ S≈´tra. The butsudan is the altar in a monastery, temple or a lay person's home, where offerings are made to the images of the Buddha, bodhisattvas and deceased family members and ancestors. Rituals usually center on major Buddhas or bodhisattvas like Avalokite≈õvara (see Guanyin), K·π£itigarbha and Manjushri. An important element in Zen ritual practice is the performance of ritual prostrations (Jp. raihai) or bows.Kapleau, Phillip (1989a). The Three Pillars of Zen: Teaching, Practice and Enlightenment. NY: Anchor Books, p. 21. One popular form of ritual in Japanese Zen is Mizuko kuy≈ç (Water child) ceremonies, which are performed for those who have had a miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion. These ceremonies are also performed in American Zen Buddhism.Wilson, Jeff, Mourning the Unborn Dead: A Buddhist Ritual Comes to America A widely practiced ritual in Chinese Chan is variously called the \\"Rite for releasing the hungry ghosts\\" or the \\"Releasing flaming mouth\\". The ritual might date back to the Tang dynasty, and was very popular during the Ming and Qing dynasties, when Chinese Esoteric Buddhist practices became diffused throughout Chinese Buddhism.Jiang Wu, Enlightenment in Dispute: The Reinvention of Chan Buddhism in Seventeenth-Century China, Oxford University Press, USA, 2011, pp. 145‚Äì147. The Chinese holiday of the Ghost Festival might also be celebrated with similar rituals for the dead. These ghost rituals are a source of contention in modern Chinese Chan, and masters such as Sheng Yen criticize the practice for not having \\"any basis in Buddhist teachings\\".Sheng Yen, Shengyan, Orthodox Chinese Buddhism: A Contemporary Chan Master's Answers to Common Questions, North Atlantic Books, 2007, p. 76. Another important type of ritual practiced in Zen are various repentance or confession rituals (Jp. zange) that were widely practiced in all forms of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. One popular Chan text on this is known as the Emperor Liang Repentance Ritual, composed by Chan master Baozhi.Repentance Ritual of the Emperor of Liang: A complete translation of Repentance Dharma of Kindness and Compassion in the Bodhimanda, Buddhist Text Translation Society, 2017. Dogen also wrote a treatise on repentance, the Shushogi.Dumoulin, Heinrich , Zen Enlightenment: Origins and Meaning, Shambhala Publications, 2007, p. 136. Other rituals could include rites dealing with local deities (kami in Japan), and ceremonies on Buddhist holidays such as Buddha's Birthday.Steven Heine, Dale S. Wright (editors), Zen Ritual: Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice, Oxford University Press, USA, 2008, p. 124-25. Funerals are also an important ritual and are a common point of contact between Zen monastics and the laity. Statistics published by the S≈çt≈ç school state that 80 percent of S≈çt≈ç laymen visit their temple only for reasons having to do with funerals and death. Seventeen percent visit for spiritual reasons and 3 percent visit a Zen priest at a time of personal trouble or crisis. = Esoteric practices = Depending on the tradition, esoteric methods such as mantra and dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ are also used for different purposes including meditation practice, protection from evil, invoking great compassion, invoking the power of certain bodhisattvas, and are chanted during ceremonies and rituals.Baroni, Helen J. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, The Rosen Publishing Group, 2002, p. 215. In the Kwan Um school of Zen for example, a mantra of Guanyin (\\"Kwanseum Bosal\\") is used during sitting meditation. The Heart Sutra Mantra is also another mantra that is used in Zen during various rituals.Borup, J√∏rn, Japanese Rinzai Zen Buddhism: My≈çshinji, a living religion, BRILL, 2008, p. 218, 241. Another example is the Mantra of Light (k≈çmy≈ç shingon), which is common in Japanese Soto Zen and was derived from the Shingon sect.Unno, Mark, Shingon Refractions: Myoe and the Mantra of Light, Ch. 1. The usage of esoteric mantras in Zen goes back to the Tang dynasty. There is evidence that Chan Buddhists adopted practices from Esoteric Buddhism in findings from Dunhuang. According to Henrik S√∏rensen, several successors of Shenxiu (such as Jingxian and Yixing) were also students of the Zhenyan (Mantra) school. Influential esoteric dhƒÅra·πáƒ´, such as the U·π£·πáƒ´·π£a Vijaya DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ S≈´tra, also begin to be cited in the literature of the Baotang school during the Tang dynasty. There is also documentation that monks living at Shaolin temple during the eighth century performed esoteric practices there such as mantra and dharani, and that these also influenced Korean Seon Buddhism. During the Joseon dynasty, the Seon school was not only the dominant tradition in Korea, but it was also highly inclusive and ecumenical in its doctrine and practices, and this included Esoteric Buddhist lore and rituals (that appear in Seon literature from the 15th century onwards). According to S√∏rensen, the writings of several Seon masters (such as Hyujeong) reveal they were esoteric adepts. In Japanese Zen, the use of esoteric practices within Zen is sometimes termed \\"mixed Zen\\" (kensh≈´ zen ÂÖº‰øÆÁ¶™), and the figure of Keizan J≈çkin (1264‚Äì1325) is seen as introducing this into the Soto school.DT Suzuki discusses what he calls \\"the Shingon elements of Chinese Zen\\" in his Manual of Zen Buddhism (1960, 21) and \\"the Chinese Shingon element\\" in The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk (1965, 80). The Japanese founder of the Rinzai school, My≈çan Eisai (1141‚Äì1215) was also a well known practitioner of esoteric Buddhism and wrote various works on the subject. According to William Bodiford, a very common dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ in Japanese Zen is the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama spell (Ry≈çgon shu Ê•ûÂö¥Âë™; T. 944A), which is repeatedly chanted during summer training retreats as well as at \\"every important monastic ceremony throughout the year\\" in Zen monasteries. Some Zen temples also perform esoteric rituals, such as the homa ritual, which is performed at the Soto temple of Eigen-ji (in Saitama prefecture). As Bodiford writes, \\"perhaps the most notable examples of this phenomenon is the ambrosia gate (kanro mon ÁîòÈú≤ÈñÄ) ritual performed at every S≈çt≈ç Zen temple\\", which is associated feeding hungry ghosts, ancestor memorial rites and the ghost festival. Bodiford also notes that formal Zen rituals of Dharma transmission often involve esoteric initiations. Doctrine A Dharma talk by Seon nun Daehaeng Kun Sunim, Hanmaum Seon Center, South Korea Zen teachings can be likened to \\"the finger pointing at the moon\\". Zen teachings point to the moon, awakening, \\"a realization of the unimpeded interpenetration of the dharmadhatu\\". But the Zen-tradition also warns against taking its teachings, the pointing finger, to be this insight itself. =Buddhist Mahayana influences= Though Zen-narrative states that it is a \\"special transmission outside scriptures\\", which \\"did not stand upon words\\", Zen does have a rich doctrinal background that is firmly grounded in the Buddhist tradition. It was thoroughly influenced by Mahayana teachings on the bodhisattva path, Chinese Madhyamaka (SƒÅnl√πn), Yogacara (W√©ish√≠), Praj√±aparamita, the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, and other Buddha nature texts. The influence of Madhyamaka and Praj√±aparamita can be discerned in the stress on non-conceptual wisdom (praj√±a) and the apophatic language of Zen literature.Dan Arnold, Madhyamaka Buddhist Philosophy, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy The philosophy of the Huayan school also had an influence on Chinese Chan. One example is the Huayan doctrine of the interpenetration of phenomena, which also makes use of native Chinese philosophical concepts such as principle (li) and phenomena (shi).Gregory, Peter N. Tsung-Mi and the Sinification of Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. 7. The Huayan theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu also influenced the Five Ranks of Dongshan Liangjie (806‚Äì869), the founder of the Caodong Chan lineage. =Buddha-nature and subitism= Central in the doctrinal development of Chan Buddhism was the notion of Buddha-nature, the idea that the awakened mind of a Buddha is already present in each sentient being (pen chueh in Chinese Buddhism, hongaku in Japanese Zen). This Buddha-nature was initially equated with the nature of mind, while later Chan-teachings evaded any reification by rejecting any positivist terminology. The idea of the immanent character of the Buddha- nature took shape in a characteristic emphasis on direct insight into, and expression of this Buddha-nature. It led to a reinterpretation and Sinification of Indian meditation terminology, and an emphasis on subitism, the idea that the Buddhist teachings and practices are comprehended and expressed \\"sudden,\\" c.q. \\"in one glance,\\" \\"uncovered all together,\\" or \\"together, completely, simultaneously,\\" in contrast to gradualism, \\"successively or being uncovered one after the other.\\" The emphasis on subitism led to the idea that \\"enlightenment occurs in a single transformation that is both total and instantaneous\\" (Ch. shih-chueh). While the attribution of gradualism, attributed by Shenhui to a concurring faction, was a rhetoric device, it led to a conceptual dominance in the Chan-tradition of subitism, in which any charge of gradualism was to be avoided. This \\"rhetorical purity\\" was hard to reconcile conceptually with the actual practice of meditation, and left little place in Zen texts for the description of actual meditation practices, apparently rejecting any form of practice. Instead, those texts directly pointed to and expressed this awakened nature, giving way to the paradoxically nature of encounter dialogue and koans. =Caodong/S≈çt≈ç/T√†o ƒê·ªông= Japanese Buddhist monk from the S≈çt≈ç Zen sect S≈çt≈ç is the Japanese line of the Chinese Caodong school, which was founded during the Tang Dynasty by Dongshan Liangjie. The S≈çt≈ç-school has de-emphasized k≈çans since Gent≈ç Sokuch≈´ (circa 1800), and instead emphasized on shikantaza. Dogen, the founder of Soto in Japan, emphasized that practice and awakening cannot be separated. By practicing shikantaza, attainment and Buddhahood are already being expressed. For Dogen, zazen, or shikantaza, is the essence of Buddhist practice. Gradual cultivation was also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie. A lineage also exists in Vietnam, founded by 17th-century Chan master Th√¥ng Gi√°c ƒê·∫°o Nam. In Vietnamese, the school is known as \\"T√†o ƒê·ªông.\\" =Linji/Rinzai= The Rinzai school is the Japanese lineage of the Chinese Linji school, which was founded during the Tang dynasty by Linji Yixuan. The Rinzai school emphasizes kensho, insight into one's true nature. This is followed by so- called post-satori practice, further practice to attain Buddhahood. Other Zen- teachers have also expressed sudden insight followed by gradual cultivation. Jinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary Sanbo Kyodan, according to whom kensh≈ç is at the start of the path to full enlightenment. To attain this primary insight and to deepen it, zazen and k≈çan-study is deemed essential. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji in his Three Mysterious Gates and Hakuin Ekaku's Four Ways of Knowing. Another example of depiction of stages on the path are the Ten Bulls, which detail the steps on the path. Zen scripture Archaeologist Aurel Stein's 1907 view of Mogao Cave 16, with altar and sutra scrolls Tablets of the Tripi·π≠aka Koreana, an early edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon, in Haeinsa Temple, South Korea =The role of scripture in Zen= Contrary to the popular image, literature does play a role in the Zen training. Zen is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. Classic Zen texts, such as the Platform sutra, contain numerous references to Buddhist canonical sutras. Unsui (Zen- monks), \\"are expected to become familiar with the classics of the Zen canon\\". A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Zen masters clearly reveals that they were well versed in numerous MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, as well as Mahayana Buddhist philosophy such as Madhyamaka. Nevertheless, Zen is often pictured as anti-intellectual. This picture of Zen emerged during the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1297), when Ch√°n became the dominant form of Buddhism in China, and gained great popularity among the educated and literary classes of Chinese society. The use of koans, which are highly stylized literary texts, reflects this popularity among the higher classes. The famous saying \\"do not establish words and letters\\", attributed in this period to Bodhidharma, What the Zen tradition emphasizes is that the enlightenment of the Buddha came not through conceptualization but rather through direct insight. But direct insight has to be supported by study and understanding (hori) of the Buddhist teachings and texts. Intellectual understanding without practice is called yako-zen, \\"wild fox Zen\\", but \\"one who has only experience without intellectual understanding is a zen temma, 'Zen devil. =Grounding Ch√°n in scripture= The early Buddhist schools in China were each based on a specific sutra. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, by the time of the Fifth Patriarch Hongren (601‚Äì674), the Zen school became established as a separate school of Buddhism. It had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to ascertain its position and to ground its teachings in a specific sutra. Various sutras were used for this even before the time of Hongren: the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ S≈´tra (Huike), Awakening of Faith (Daoxin), the Lankavatara Sutra (East Mountain School), the Diamond Sutra (Shenhui), and the Platform Sutra. None of these sutras were decisive though, since the school drew inspiration from a variety of sources. Subsequently, the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature, which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Other influential sutras are the Vimalakirti Sutra, Avatamsaka Sutra, the Shurangama Sutra, and the Mahaparinirvana Sutra. =Zen literature= The Zen-tradition developed a rich textual tradition, based on the interpretation of the Buddhist teachings and the recorded sayings of Zen- masters. Important texts are the Platform Sutra (8th century), attributed to Huineng ; the Ch√°n transmission records, teng-lu, such as The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp (Ching-te ch'uan-teng lu), compiled by Tao-y√ºn and published in 1004; the \\"y√º-l√º\\" genre consisting of the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues; the koan-collections, such as the \\"Gateless Gate\\" and the \\"Blue Cliff Record\\". Zen organization and institutions Religion is not only an individual matter, but \\"also a collective endeavour\\". Though individual experience and the iconoclastic picture of Zen are emphasised in the Western world, the Zen-tradition is maintained and transferred by a high degree of institutionalisation and hierarchy. In Japan, modernity has led to criticism of the formal system and the commencement of lay-oriented Zen-schools such as the Sanbo Kyodan and the Ningen Zen Kyodan. How to organize the continuity of the Zen-tradition in the West, constraining charismatic authority and the derailment it may bring on the one hand, and maintaining the legitimacy and authority by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand, is a challenge for the developing Zen-communities in the West. Zen narratives The Ch√°n of the Tang Dynasty, especially that of Mazu and Linji with its emphasis on \\"shock techniques\\", in retrospect was seen as a golden age of Ch√°n. It became dominant during the Song Dynasty, when Ch√°n was the dominant form of Buddhism in China, due to support from the Imperial Court. This picture has gained great popularity in the West in the 20th century, especially due to the influence of D.T. Suzuki, and further popularized by Hakuun Yasutani and the Sanbo Kyodan. This picture has been challenged, and complemented, since the 1970s by modern scientific research on Zen. Modern scientific research on the history of Zen discerns three main narratives concerning Zen, its history and its teachings: Traditional Zen Narrative (TZN), Buddhist Modernism (BM), Historical and Cultural Criticism (HCC). An external narrative is Nondualism, which claims Zen to be a token of a universal nondualist essence of religions.  History  = Chinese Ch√°n = Huike Offering His Arm to Bodhidharma, Sessh≈´ T≈çy≈ç (1496). Zen (Chinese: Ch√°n Á¶™) Buddhism, as we know it today, is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Zen, some of which remained influential, while others vanished. The history of Ch√°n in China is divided into various periods by different scholars, who generally distinguish a classical phase and a post- classical period. Ferguson distinguishes three periods from the 5th century into the 13th century: # The Legendary period, from Bodhidharma in the late 5th century to the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE, in the middle of the Tang Dynasty. Little written information is left from this period. It is the time of the Six Patriarchs, including Bodhidharma and Huineng, and the legendary \\"split\\" between the Northern and the Southern School of Ch√°n. # The Classical period, from the end of the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE to the beginning of the Song Dynasty around 950 CE. This is the time of the great masters of Ch√°n, such as Mazu Daoyi and Linji Yixuan, and the creation of the y√º-l√º genre, the recordings of the sayings and teachings of these great masters. # The Literary period, from around 950 to 1250, which spans the era of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279). In this time the gongan-collections were compiled, collections of sayings and deeds by the famous masters, appended with poetry and commentary. This genre reflects the influence of literati on the development of Ch√°n. This period idealized the previous period as the \\"golden age\\" of Ch√°n, producing the literature in which the spontaneity of the celebrated masters was portrayed. Although McRae has reservations about the division of Ch√°n-history in phases or periods, he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Ch√°n: # Proto-Ch√°n (c. 500‚Äì600) (Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 to 589) and Sui Dynasty (589‚Äì618 CE)). In this phase, Ch√°n developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of dhyana and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma and Huike. Its principal text is the Two Entrances and Four Practices, attributed to Bodhidharma. #Early Ch√°n (c. 600‚Äì900) (Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907 CE)). In this phase Ch√°n took its first clear contours. Prime figures are the fifth patriarch Daman Hongren (601‚Äì674), his dharma-heir Yuquan Shenxiu (606?‚Äì706), the sixth patriarch Huineng (638‚Äì713), protagonist of the quintessential Platform Sutra, and Shenhui (670‚Äì762), whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch. Prime factions are the Northern School, Southern School and Oxhead school. # Middle Ch√°n (c. 750‚Äì1000) (from An Lushan Rebellion (755‚Äì763) till Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907‚Äì960/979)). In this phase developed the well-known Ch√°n of the iconoclastic zen-masters. Prime figures are Mazu Daoyi (709‚Äì788), Shitou Xiqian (710‚Äì790), Linji Yixuan (died 867), and Xuefeng Yicun (822‚Äì908). Prime factions are the Hongzhou school and the Hubei faction An important text is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952), which gives a great amount of \\"encounter-stories\\", and the well-known genealogy of the Ch√°n-school. # Song Dynasty Ch√°n (c. 950‚Äì1300). In this phase Ch√°n took its definitive shape including the picture of the \\"golden age\\" of the Ch√°n of the Tang-Dynasty, and the use of koans for individual study and meditation. Prime figures are Dahui Zonggao (1089‚Äì1163) who introduced the Hua Tou practice and Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091‚Äì1157) who emphasized Shikantaza. Prime factions are the Linji school and the Caodong school. The classic koan-collections, such as the Blue Cliff Record were assembled in this period, which reflect the influence of the \\"literati\\" on the development of Ch√°n. In this phase Ch√°n is transported to Japan, and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul. Neither Ferguson nor McRae give a periodisation for Chinese Ch√°n following the Song-dynasty, though McRae mentions :[5.] \\"at least a postclassical phase or perhaps multiple phases\\". Origins and Taoist influences (c. 200‚Äì500) When Buddhism came to China from Gandhara (now Afghanistan) and India, it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to Confucianist and Taoist influences. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki, calling Ch√°n a \\"natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions.\\" Buddhism was first identified to be \\"a barbarian variant of Taoism\\": Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, a practice termed ko-i, \\"matching the concepts\\", while the emerging Chinese Buddhism had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism. The first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists. They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques, and blended them with Taoist meditation. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of naturalness was inherited by the early Ch√°n disciples: they equated ‚Äì to some extent ‚Äì the ineffable Tao and Buddha-nature, and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract \\"wisdom of the s≈´tras\\", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in \\"everyday\\" human life, just like the Tao. In addition to Taoist ideas, also Neo-Taoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism. Concepts such as \\"T'i -yung\\" (Essence and Function) and \\"Li-shih\\" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism, which consequently influenced Ch√°n deeply. One point of confusion for Chinese Buddhism was the two truths doctrine. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ontological truths: reality exists on two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being. In Madhyamaka the two truths are two epistemological truths: two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha- nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.  Proto-Ch√°n  Proto-Ch√°n (c. 500‚Äì600) encompasses the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 to 589) and Sui Dynasty (589‚Äì618 CE). In this phase, Ch√°n developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of dhyana and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma and Huike, though there is little actual historical information about these early figures and most legendary stories about their life come from later, mostly Tang sources. An important text from this period is the Two Entrances and Four Practices, found in Dunhuang, and attributed to Bodhidharma. Later sources mention that these figures taught using the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra though there is no direct evidence of this from the earliest sources.  Early Ch√°n  Early Ch√°n refers to early Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì750) Ch√°n. The fifth patriarch Daman Hongren (601‚Äì674), and his dharma-heir Yuquan Shenxiu (606?‚Äì706) were influential in founding the first Chan institution in Chinese history, known as the \\"East Mountain school\\" (Dongshan famen). Hongren taught the practice of shou-hsin, \\"maintaining (guarding) the mind,\\" in which \\"an awareness of True Mind or Buddha-nature within\\" is maintained, \\"[exhorting] the practitioners to unremittingly apply themselves to the practice of meditation.\\" Shenxiu was the most influential and charismatic student of Hongren, he was even invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu. Shenxiu also became the target of much criticism by Shenhui (670‚Äì762), for his \\"gradualist\\" teachings. Shenhui instead promoted the \\"sudden\\" teachings of his teacher Huineng (638‚Äì713) as well as what later became a very influential Ch√°n classic called the Platform Sutra. Shenhui's propaganda campaign eventually succeeded in elevating Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch of Chinese Ch√°n. The sudden vs. gradual debate that developed in this era came to define later forms of Chan Buddhism.Ray, Gary L. The Northern Ch'an School And Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates In China And Tibet, Institute Of Buddhist Studies Berkeley.  Middle Ch√°n  The Middle Ch√°n (c. 750‚Äì1000) period runs from the An Lushan Rebellion (755‚Äì763) to the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907‚Äì960/979). This phase saw the development new schools of Chan. The most important of these schools is the Hongzhou school of Mazu Daoyi (709‚Äì788), to which also belong Shitou, Baizhang, and Huangbo. This school is sometimes seen as the archetypal expression of Ch√°n, with its emphasis on the personal expression of insight, and its rejection of positive statements, as well as the importance it placed on spontaneous and unconventional \\"questions and answers during an encounter\\" (linji wenda) between master and disciple. However, modern scholars have seen much of the literature that presents these \\"iconoclastic\\" encounters as being later revisions during the Song era, and instead see the Hongzhou masters as not being very radical, instead promoting pretty conservative ideas, such as keeping precepts, accumulating good karma and practicing meditation. However, the school did produce innovative teachings and perspectives such as Mazu's views that \\"this mind is Buddha\\" and that \\"ordinary mind is the way\\", which were also critiqued by later figures, such as the influential Guifeng Zongmi (780‚Äì841), for failing to differentiate between ignorance and enlightenment. By the end of the late Tang, the Hongzhou school was gradually superseded by various regional traditions, which became known as the Five Houses of Ch√°n. Shitou Xiqian (710‚Äì790) is regarded as the Patriarch of C√°od√≤ng (Jp. S≈çt≈ç) school, while Linji Yixuan (died 867) is regarded as the founder of L√≠nj√¨ (Jp. Rinzai) school. Both of these traditions were quite influential both in and outside of China. Another influential Ch√°n master of the late Tang was Xuefeng Yicun. During the later Tang, the practice of the \\"encounter dialogue\\" reached its full maturity. These formal dialogues between master and disciple used absurd, illogical and iconoclastic language as well as non-verbal forms of communication such as the drawing of circles and physical gestures like shouting and hitting. It was also common to write fictional encounter dialogues and attribute them to previous Ch√°n figures. An important text from this period is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952), which gives many \\"encounter-stories\\", as well as establishing a genealogy of the Ch√°n school. The Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution in 845 was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Mazu survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.  Song Dynasty Ch√°n  Dahui introduced the method of kan huatou, or \\"inspecting the critical phrase\\", of a k≈çan story. This method was called the \\"Chan of k≈çan introspection\\" (Kanhua Chan).Yu, Chun-Fang, 1979, Ta-hui Tsung-kao and Kung-an Ch'an, Journal of Chinese Philosophy, v. 6, p. 211-235 During Song Dynasty Ch√°n (c. 950‚Äì1300), Ch√°n Buddhism took its definitive shape, developed the use of koans for individual study and meditation and formalized its own idealized history with the legend of the Tang \\"golden age\\". During the Song, Ch√°n became the largest sect of Chinese Buddhism and had strong ties to the imperial government, which led to the development of a highly organized system of temple rank and administration. The dominant form of Song Ch√°n was the Linji school due to support from the scholar-official class and the imperial court. This school developed the study of gong'an (\\"public case\\") literature, which depicted stories of master-student encounters that were seen as demonstrations of the awakened mind. During the 12th century, a rivalry emerged between the Linji and the Caodong schools for the support of the scholar-official class. Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091‚Äì1157) of the Caodong school emphasized silent illumination or serene reflection (m√≤zh√†o) as a means for solitary practice, which could be undertaken by lay-followers. The Linji school's Dahui Zonggao (1089‚Äì1163) meanwhile, introduced k'an-hua chan (\\"observing the word-head\\" chan), which involved meditation on the crucial phrase or \\"punch line\\" (hua- tou) of a gong'an. The Song also saw the syncretism of Ch√°n and Pure Land Buddhism by Yongming Yanshou (904‚Äì975), which would later become extremely influential.Heng-Ching Shih (1987). Yung-Ming's Syncretism of Pure Land and Chan, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 10 (1), p. 117 Yongming also echoed Zongmi's work in indicating that the values of Taoism and Confucianism could also be embraced and integrated into Buddhism. Ch√°n also influenced Neo-Confucianism as well as certain forms of Taoism, such as the Quanzhen school. The classic Chan koan collections, such as the Blue Cliff Record and the Gateless barrier were assembled in this period,, which reflect the learned influence of the highly intellectual scholar-official class or \\"literati\\" on the development of Ch√°n. In this phase, Ch√°n is transported to Japan and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul.  Post-Classical Ch√°n  During the Ming Dynasty, the Ch√°n school was so dominant that all Chinese monks were affiliated with either the Linji school or the Caodong school.Stanley Weinstein, \\"The Schools of Chinese Buddhism,\\" in Kitagawa & Cummings (eds.), Buddhism and Asian History (New York: Macmillan 1987) pp. 257‚Äì265, 264. Some scholars see the post-classical phase as being an \\"age of syncretism.\\" The post-classical period saw the increasing popularity of the dual practice of Ch√°n and Pure Land Buddhism (known as nianfo Chan), as seen in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263‚Äì1323) and the great reformer Hanshan Deqing (1546‚Äì1623). This became a widespread phenomenon and in time much of the distinction between them was lost, with many monasteries teaching both Ch√°n meditation and the Pure Land practice of nianfo.Keown, Damien. A Dictionary of Buddhism. 2003. p. 104 The Ming dynasty saw increasing efforts by figures such as Yunqi Zhuhong (1535‚Äì1615) and Daguan Zhenke (1543‚Äì1603) to revive and reconcile Chan Buddhism with the practice of scriptural study and writing. In the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, Ch√°n was \\"reinvented\\", by the \\"revival of beating and shouting practices\\" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566‚Äì1642), and the publication of the Wudeng yantong (\\"The strict transmission of the five Chan schools\\") by Feiyin Tongrong's (1593‚Äì1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of \\"lineage unknown\\" (sifa weixiang), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong-monks.  Modern era  Xuyun was one of the most influential Ch√°n Buddhists of the 19th and 20th centuries.Buswell, Robert Jr; Lopez, Donald S. Jr., eds. (2013). \\"Xuyun\\", in Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 1017. . After further centuries of decline during the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912), Ch√°n activity was revived again in the 19th and 20th centuries by a flurry of modernist activity. This period saw the rise of worldly Chan activism, what is sometimes called Humanistic Buddhism (or more literally \\"Buddhism for human life\\", rensheng fojiao), promoted by figures like Jing'an (1851‚Äì1912), Yuanying (1878‚Äì1953), Taixu (1890‚Äì1947), Xuyun (1840‚Äì1959) and Yinshun (1906‚Äì2005). These figures promoted social activism to address issues such as poverty and social injustice, as well as participation in political movements. They also promoted modern science and scholarship, including the use of the methods of modern critical scholarship to study the history of Chan. Many Ch√°n teachers today trace their lineage back to Xuyun, including Sheng-yen and Hsuan Hua, who have propagated Ch√°n in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st centuries. Ch√°n Buddhism was repressed in China during the 1960s in the Cultural Revolution, but in the subsequent reform and opening up period in the 1970s, a revival of Chinese Buddhism has been taking place on the mainland, while Buddhism has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese. =Spread outside of China=  Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn  Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh leading a namo avalokiteshvaraya chanting session with monastics from his Order of Interbeing, Germany 2010 Chan was introduced to Vietnam during the early Chinese occupation periods (111 BCE to 939 CE) as Thi·ªÅn. During the L√Ω (1009‚Äì1225) and Tr·∫ßn (1225 to 1400) dynasties, Thi·ªÅn rose to prominence among the elites and the royal court and a new native tradition was founded, the Tr√∫c L√¢m (\\"Bamboo Grove\\") school, which also contained Confucian and Taoist influences. In the 17th century, the Linji school was brought to Vietnam as the L√¢m T·∫ø, which also mixed Chan and Pure land. L√¢m T·∫ø remains the largest monastic order in the country today.Powers, John, A Concise Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Oneworld Publications, 2013 , p.238 Modern Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn is influenced by Buddhist modernism.Borup, J√∏rn; Qvortrup Fibiger, Marianne; Eastspirit: Transnational Spirituality and Religious Circulation in East and West, BRILL, 2017, p. 168. Important figures include Thi·ªÅn master Th√≠ch Thanh T·ª´ (1924‚Äì), the activist and popularizer Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh (1926‚Äì) and the philosopher Th√≠ch Thi√™n-√Çn. Vietnamese Thi·ªÅn is eclectic and inclusive, bringing in many practices such as breath meditation, nianfo, mantra, Theravada influences, chanting, sutra recitation and engaged Buddhism activism. Korean Seon Jogyesa is the headquarters of the Jogye Order. The temple was first established in 1395, at the dawn of the Joseon Dynasty. Seon (ÏÑ†) was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks began to travel to China to learn the newly developing Chan tradition of Mazu Daoyi and returned home to establish the Chan school. They established the initial Seon schools of Korea, which were known as the \\"nine mountain schools\\" (‰πùÂ±±, gusan). Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul (1158‚Äì1210), who is considered the most influential figure in the formation of the mature Seon school. He founded the Jogye Order, which remains the largest Seon tradition in Korea today. Jinul founded the Songgwangsa temple as a new center of Seon study and practice. Jinul also wrote extensive works on Seon, developing a comprehensive system of thought and practice. From Dahui Zonggao, Jinul adopted the hwadu method, which remains the main meditation form taught in Seon today. Buddhism was mostly suppressed during the strictly Confucian Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1910), and the number of monasteries and clergy sharply declined. The period of Japanese occupation also brought numerous modernist ideas and changes to Korean Seon. Some monks began to adopt the Japanese practice of marrying and having families, while others such as Yongseong, worked to resist the Japanese occupation. Today, the largest Seon school, the Jogye, enforces celibacy, while the second largest, the Taego Order, allows for married priests. Important modernist figures that influenced contemporary Seon include Seongcheol and Gyeongheo. Seon has also been transmitted to West, with new traditions such as the Kwan Um School of Zen. Japanese Zen Sojiji Temple, of the Soto Zen school, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Japan Zen was not introduced as a separate school until the 12th century, when My≈çan Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which eventually perished. Decades later, (1235‚Äì1308) also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese Otokan lineage, the most influential and only surviving lineage of Rinzai in Japan. In 1215, D≈çgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Tiantong Rujing. After his return, D≈çgen established the S≈çt≈ç school, the Japanese branch of Caodong. The three traditional schools of Zen in contemporary Japan are the , , and . Of these, S≈çt≈ç is the largest, and ≈åbaku the smallest, with Rinzai in the middle. These schools are further divided into subschools by head temple, with two head temples for S≈çt≈ç (S≈çji- ji and Eihei-ji, with S≈çji-ji having a much larger network), fourteen head temples for Rinzai, and one head temple (Manpuku-ji) for ≈åbaku, for a total of 17 head temples. The Rinzai head temples, which are most numerous, have substantial overlap with the traditional Five Mountain System, and include Myoshin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenry≈´-ji, Daitoku-ji, and Tofuku-ji, among others. Besides these traditional organizations, there are modern Zen organisations that have especially attracted Western lay followers, namely the Sanbo Kyodan and the FAS Society.  Zen in the West  Although it is difficult to trace the precise moment when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced the profile of Zen in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners other than the descendants of Asian immigrants who were pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. Japanese Zen has gained the greatest popularity in the West. The various books on Zen by Reginald Horace Blyth, Alan Watts, Philip Kapleau and D. T. Suzuki published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest on the part of beat poets such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder. In 1958, the literary magazine Chicago Review played a significant role in introducing Zen to the American literary communityJosephine Nock-Hee Park, Apparitions of Asia: modernist form and Asian American poetics, p. 63 when it published a special issue on Zen featuring the aforementioned beat poets and works in translation. Erich Fromm quotes D. T. Suzuki in his 1960 book Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism.

Wellesley Aron: Rebel with a Cause, Valentine Mitchell, 1992. Wellesley Aron, MBE His obituary by Philip Gillon in The Jerusalem Post sums it up. \\"Wellesley Aron, who died a week ago, a few days before his 87th birthday, could have been typecast for one of those BBC films about idealistic English upper class officers and gentlemen who espouse what appears to be hopeless causes and convert them into practical successes, in defiance of prejudices and huge obstacles. Physically, he looked the part, with his ramrod-straight back and his major's moustache; educated at Cambridge, he also talked Nancy Mitford's U-language. Wellesley could be summed up in one word ‚Äì integrity.\\",Philip Gillon, The Jerusalem Post, 14 June 1988 Wellesley founded Habonim, which became the largest Zionist Youth movement worldwide; commanded a unit in the British Army in World War II; rescued refugees fleeing The Holocaust and organised Mahal (volunteers for the Israeli army) in the United States. He was also a successful internationally known businessman; the creator and teacher of courses on peace for school children; a pioneer in establishing Rotary International in Israel and, finally, in his late years, a founder of the Arab/Jewish community of Neve Shalom ‚Äì WƒÅƒßat as-SalƒÅm, where he died in 1988. Wellesley Aron's first wife died in 1978. They had two children, Sharona and Ylona. In 1981 he married Coral Benjamin.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause. Early years Born in London on 18 June 1901, he was the only child of a German Jewish mother but the fifth child of a German Jewish father. His half-siblings were all raised in their mother's Christian faith. Jewish religious observance was almost non-existent in his mother's home according to Wellesley.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause p.12. During World War I the family lived for a time in Germany before moving to Switzerland. His half-brother and a cousin died during the war, which he believed led to his father's death shortly after. At the end of the war, Wellesley and his mother returned to London.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.18. In 1919 Wellesley enrolled at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied ancient and modern French history. However, at his mother's insistence he returned to London and became involved in the business world. It was at this time, in 1921, at the suggestion of Basil Henriques, that Wellesley became involved with disadvantaged youth from the East End of London. Having been an active Boy Scout during his school years, he saw scouting as the solution to giving the young people a sense of purpose. He founded the 36th Stepney Jewish Scout Troop which would become known in London for its scouting prowess. This first encounter with poor Jews was to have a profound influence for the rest of his life ‚Äì \\"the two years I spent with these responsive young scouts left a real and lasting satisfaction such as I have never experienced\\".Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.19. He returned to Cambridge over his mother's objections. Forced to support himself, he took the post of assistant housemaster at Hillel House. At this period Wellesley had his first personal encounter with antisemitism. He spent vacation time with his Christian half-sister in Devon. There he met and fell in love with a young woman. They wanted to marry her but her father refused to allow it because Aron was Jewish.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.20.  Zionism  Returning to Cambridge he was in total shock over this rejection based simply on the fact that he was a Jew, and spent much time soul searching. For the first time he was forced to ask himself, what, if anything, it meant to be a Jew. Eventually he came to the conclusion that he had to go to Palestine. Always a person of action he actively prepared for his emigration to Palestine. Already speaking three languages he now studied Hebrew. At the same time, he became active in the student Zionist club. It was here that he first met Dr.Chaim Weizmann, the chemist and Zionist leader who later became Israel's first President. At the same time, he faced another inconsistency ‚Äì the ambivalence displayed by English Jews to the Zionist aim of reestablishing a sovereign Jewish community in Palestine. Basil Henriques, who had often charged him with being \\"un-Jewish\\" for not including Jewish content into his Scouting activities, now saw it as a \\"tragedy\\" that Aron had decided to go to Palestine. Wellesley recalled that it was this period that forced him to reject the conventional religious approach of Orthodox Judaism and look instead \\"to the renaissance of the Jewish People as a political entity in its own homeland\\".Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.28. After graduating Cambridge in 1926, he moved to what was then Palestine. He spent the next years in Haifa and Tel Aviv teaching sports and English ‚Äì first at Reali and then at the famous Herzliya Gymnasia. In the meantime, he began to familiarise himself with Zionism. He met and married his wife Rose and they had their first child, a girl.  Habonim  Before his return to London, Wellesley was asked by Weizmann for a second time in 1927 to assist with the political wing of the Zionist Office in London. Due to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 in which \\"His Majesty's Government viewed with favour the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine\\", the centre of political Zionism had moved to London.) Wellesley returned a year later with his young family and started to work at the Zionist Federation Offices at 77 Great Russell Street. His overseer there, Leonard Stein did not share his work burden easily, and Wellesley found himself with relatively little to do. He therefore decided to see for himself the extent to which Jewish history was being taught in the Stepney Jewish youth clubs in London's poverty-struck East End, which, at that time, were being run by his friend Basil Henriques. He found that the clubs were Jewish only because of their membership and nothing about Jewish history or about Palestine was being taught.Habonim archives, Yad Tabenkin, Ramat Efel, Israel Wellesley's solution was to found a new non-Zionist \\"Jewish cultural youth movement\\", which would combine the principles of Baden Powell's scouting with a love of Jewish heritage, and taught not only Jewish history but also Modern Hebrew and songs and dances, in addition to camping craft and other outdoor activities, like the Scouting Movement. Wellesley produced a handbook with instructions on how to run groups of teenagers, using elements of Jewish history and symbolism, tests and ceremonies not dissimilar to those customary in scouting. To build the content around Jewish civilisation, Wellesley authored a history of the Jewish people in \\"a thousand words ...that a child could read\\". His prior attempts to get this written by various authoritative Jewish sources had failed to achieve suitable results, and he was thus constrained to undertake the task on his own.recorded interviews with Aron, about 1977, in Habonim archives, Yad Tabenkin, Ramat Efal, Israel Aron's efforts to obtain funding to move forward the establishment of Habonim also saw him become one of the founders of the Bar-Kochba Jewish sports organisation in England. \\"It was easier to get moneys for sports than Jewish culture\\" he later recalled. Bar-Kochba in turn led to the founding of the English Maccabi sports movement.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.52. In 1931, on the termination of his position under Weizmann, Wellesley returned to Palestine. Habonim, which began as \\"a Jewish Cultural Youth Movement\\" subsequently developed into a Zionist Youth Movement that has had enormous impact in both Israel and Jewish communities worldwide. Habonim flourished and has become worldwide in its activities. It has since linked up with Dror, a semi-political Jewish Zionist Movement whose roots go back to 1917 Polish and European sources. Palestine and World War II  On his return Palestine, Wellesley founded a successful advertising agency. In 1938, aware of the possibility of war with Germany, Aron made strenuous efforts to interest the British High Command in the idea of stockpiling reserve supplies of war materiel and food in Palestine. He foresaw the possibility of Germany being victorious in North Africa. When these efforts failed and war broke out in 1939, he enlisted in the British Army as a Palestinian volunteer, where he rose to become the senior Jewish officer enlisted from Palestine and the first to command a unit. His unit, 178 coy, RASC,London Gazette, 25 September 1945 was made up primarily of Jewish Palestinian volunteers. Together with four other Jewish RASC units they served with the Eight Army in North Africa. At Tobruk they were under siege for several months until rescued and convoyed by sea to Egypt. Later, in Italy in 1944, risking court-martial, he led his unit in helping rescue many Jewish refugees who had escaped the concentration camps of the Holocaust. Aron's unit, together with the other Jewish Palestinian R.A.S.C units, became the vanguard of the Jewish Brigade founded in 1944. Aron authored his account of that military experience (see reference).Wellesley Aron, Wheels in the Storm: the Genesis of the Israeli defence forces, Roebuck Society, Australia, 1974,(Hebrew edition 1967). In 1945 Wellesley was one of four Jewish Palestinian officers to receive awards from the British Government. According to the citation, \\"Wellesley was an officer of the first Palestinian R.A.S.C Company to see active service in the desert and is the senior Palestinian R.A.S.C Company Commander.... Major Wellesley proved himself to be an officer of outstanding merit who devotes himself wholeheartedly to the interests of his own unit and of the formation he serves\\"  Israel At war's end, Wellesley continued his involvement in Zionist activities. In November 1945, given his military experience, he was asked to join David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir and Chaim Weizmann in testifying before the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in Jerusalem. As was often the case, his testimony showed his independence. Despite being a British Military officer he spoke against the prevailing British viewpoint.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, pp.117‚Äì118. In 1947, he was asked to organise the Machal office in New York. This was his last official mission for the new State. However, later back in Israel and having returned to private business, he engaged in covert meetings on behalf of Israel aimed at reducing tensions with Jordan.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, pp.132,138. Always the organiser, Wellesley was heavily involved in developing Rotary in Israel. Joining in 1934, he became its first District Governor after working hard to have Israel recognised as of District in Rotary International. Rotary brought him back once again to involvement with neglected youth in low-income areas. This earlier experience had led him to the founding of Habonim. Now the result was the building of a youth sports centre in Jaffa.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.141. At the other end of the social scale he volunteered his organising skills to the planning committee for Israel's first golf course in Caesarea. Peace activism Wellesley had a total commitment to peace. In 1967, following the Six-Day War, he volunteered to \\"teach peace\\" to high school seniors in Tel Aviv. So enthusiastic was the response he was asked to repeat the course at an Arab school in Jaffa. In 1967 his quest for peace led him to several years of research seeking to find an institution that had peace as the foundation of its curriculum. He prepared a symposium outline for the Harry S. Truman Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which was rejected on the grounds that it had too much emphasis on youth and not enough on the scholarly approach.Silman-Cheong, Helen, Rebel with a Cause, p.152. Neve Shalom ‚Äì WƒÅƒßat as-SalƒÅm His personal commitment to peace among peoples found its ultimate expression in the last years of his life. At age 70, Wellesley joined Father Bruno Hussar, a Catholic priest, in pioneering the establishment of Neve Shalom ‚Äì WƒÅƒßat as- SalƒÅm, an Arab-Jewish village near Jerusalem. He moved there with his second wife, Coral, in 1980. Samuel W. Lewis, former USA Ambassador to Israel and close friend described their home as a \\"...concrete box on a windswept, barren, rocky hill\\". They lived there until his death in 1988. He is quoted as saying that his quest for a programme where peace is taught started with a question from his grandson. The grandson wanted to know why there are only war colleges and not peace colleges? That grandson, David Broza, one of Israel's singing superstars, has taken over his grandfather's mantle in the quest for peace.

It was first opened in 1900 in Mosgiel and was relocated to Auckland in 1997. Establishment In the late nineteenth century, although there were 90,000 Catholics constituting about 14 per cent of the total population, New Zealand had no seminary for training priestsPeter Joseph Norris, Southernmost Seminary: The story of Holy Cross College, Mosgiel (1900-97), Holy Cross Seminary, Auckland, 1999, pp. 11‚Äì15. In 1850 Bishop Pompallier the first bishop, had established a seminary in Auckland, St Mary's Seminary, which resulted in the ordination of more than twenty four priests over two decades.Good Shepherd College website, Our History (retrieved 6 December 2011) Hampered by financial difficulties and personality problems, the seminary closed in 1869. Various bishops, particularly Patrick Moran first Bishop of Dunedin, had expressed concern over the absence of a national seminary. Its lack became pressing when New Zealand was created an ecclesiastical province with Wellington as the Metropolitan See in 1887. Prior to this the New Zealand Bishops were largely influenced by Cardinal Moran in Sydney to send seminarians to his Manly seminary where Bishop Michael Verdon, the second Bishop of Dunedin (1896-1918) had been Rector. In 1896 Verdon expressed the need for local training from a particular perspective when he complained that his \\"most promising student James Liston had returned from Manly to New Zealand \\"undernourished and unwell\\". Verdon wrote to Dr. Murphy (Verdon's successor as Rector at Manly) complaining that Liston: \\" ... was in very poor health indeed when he came home in December and his parents were greatly troubled about him. They brought him to the best doctor in Dunedin who forbade them to send him again to Manly. His parents will keep him at home for some months and then will probably send him to Ireland to continue his studies\\". Verdon was determined that New Zealand should have its own seminary and offered to take full personal responsibility for the venture. The other New Zealand Bishops accepted his offer. The seminary was to be a minor (high school, preparatory) as well as a major (arts, philosophy and theology) seminary. On 12 April 1899 Bishop Verdon purchased a house on an 11-acre site at Mosgiel built in 1878. Verdon thought that he could staff the seminary with Vincentian priests. But he was unsuccessful in obtaining their services and decided to start the College with his own priests. The seminary, with eleven students in residence, and with Bishop Verdon as its first Rector, opened on 3 May 1900, the Feast of the Holy Cross. A later teacher at, and Rector (1910-1920) of, the College was James Michael Liston.Nicholas Reid, James Michael Liston: A Life, Victoria University Press, Wellington, 2006, p. 50-54. Holy Cross College at Mosgiel In August 1900 work began on a new chapel for the College. It was blessed and opened on 3 May 1901. Its architect was Commanditori Leonardi, the papal architect for Pope Leo XIII and a friend of Verdon's. Built in true Roman style, with semicircular windows, marble altar, gilded copper ceiling and classic ionic pilasters, the chapel was an important part of Verdon's attempt to recreate at Mosgiel the spiritual atmosphere of Rome. The first ordination in the chapel occurred in 1902 when Patrick O'Neill was ordained a deacon. In 1902 the enrollment had doubled to 22. On 12 December 1909 Verdon ordained the first six priests from the seminary. The establishment of Holy Cross College was a significant step forward for the Church in New Zealand ensuring an adequate supply of clergy trained in New Zealand and also creating \\"a very real bond between the secular priests of the country\\".ER Simmons, A Brief History of the Catholic Church in New Zealand, Catholic Publications Centre, Auckland, 1978, p. 89 From the beginning Holy Cross Seminary was designed to equip priests to minister within an established minority community and to preserve the identity of that community.Peter Joseph Norris, pp. 143‚Äì145. The seminary gave to its students a monastic type formation. Only by separating people from the world and giving them a new vision would they be able to re-enter the world and save people from it. Over the next 50 years the College became even more like a monastery. Even though it was located near the bustling city of Dunedin, it was yet set apart in relative isolation. It became an oasis of prayer, study and seclusion. The gradual establishment of various institutions like a printery, bindery, butchery, darkroom and farm separated it from the life of the surrounding community. New buildings were added as the twentieth century progressed. In 1963 a new chapel, called the Verdon chapel, was completed and the remains of Bishop Verdon were reinterred there during a Pontifical Requiem Mass offered by Archbishop ListonPeter Joseph Norris, pp. 81 and 82. The function of preparation for entering Holy Cross College was fulfilled from 1947 by the founding of Holy Name Seminary, Christchurch, a minor seminary operated by the Jesuits.Peter Joseph Norris, pp. 50‚Äì55. From 1954, this seminary assumed responsibility for teaching the Philosophy section of the seminary curriculum as a major seminary.Bernard O'Brien SJ, A New Zealand Jesuit: A Personal Narrative, Pegasus, Christchurch, 1970, p. 75. The monastic and separatist ideal was challenged after the Second Vatican Council and the publication of Gaudium et spes (\\"the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World\\"). The emphasis changed to interaction with the world. The College collaborated with the University of Otago in the introduction of Bachelor of Theology degree and courses in pastoral studies were introduced in addition to the traditional focus on theology and philosophy. The College was staffed by secular clergy and others until 1934 and then by the Vincentian order until 1989.Peter Joseph Norris, p. 152 In the 98 years that the College was at Mosgiel (1900-1997) it had 1302 students. Of those, 648 were ordained at the end of their studies as priests.Peter Joseph Norris, p. 157 Move to Auckland From the 1980s the College had fewer enrolments. Also there had been a negative review carried out by the University of Otago of the courses offered by Holy Cross College which greatly diminished the Bishops' commitment to staying at Mosgiel. The population of New Zealand was becoming increasingly located in the North Island. The Bishops decided to move the seminary to Auckland to join the Marist seminary already relocated there a few years previously. The main reasons given for the shift were the possibility of finding it easier to get qualified staff and also the need for the seminary to be more open to Maori and Pacific cultures (heavily concentrated in Auckland and the north). Holy Cross Seminary opened in Ponsonby, Auckland for the 1998 academic year.Peter Joseph Norris, pp. 137-142 Lectures are undertaken at Good Shepherd College which is located near Holy Cross Seminary and is jointly staffed by Diocesan Clergy, clergy of the Society of Mary and members of other Catholic religious congregations. Alumni Most New Zealand Catholic secular priests ordained since 1900 are graduates of Holy Cross College.

He builds a boat in his back yard, to great annoyance to his wife and neighbors. When they ask him why he builds it, he tells them he doesn't know. Elwood exhibits post traumatic stress disorder, and shuns most people around him, including his family and co-workers. One day, he decides to go home in the middle of his job to work on the boat. He gazes at the boat, wondering why he's building it. As it starts raining, he finally realizes why. Reception According to Steven Owen Godersky: \\"Phil Dick's third major theme is his fascination with war and his fear and hatred of it. One hardly sees critical mention of it, yet it is as integral to his body of work as oxygen is to water.\\"The Collected Stories Of Philip K.

Members of this genus are homoxenous and often reside in the gastrointestinal tract of the host, however others may be found in organs such as the gallbladder or liver.Dogga, S. K., Barto≈°ov√°-Sojkov√°, P., Luke≈°, J., & Soldati-Favre, D. (2015). Phylogeny, Morphology, and Metabolic and Invasive Capabilities of Epicellular Fish Coccidium Goussia janae. Protist, 166(6), 659‚Äì676. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2015.09.003 The genera Goussia, as current phylogenies indicate, is part of the class Conoidasida, which is a subset of the parasitic phylum Apicomplexa; features of this phylum, such as a distinct apical complex containing specialized secretory organelles, an apical polar ring, and a conoid are all present within Goussia, and assist in the mechanical invasion of host tissue.Morrissette, N. S., & Sibley, L. D. (2002). Cytoskeleton of Apicomplexan Parasites. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 66(1), 21‚Äì38. https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.66.1.21-38.2002 The name Goussia is derived from the French word gousse, meaning pod. This name is based on the bi-valve sporocyst morphology which some Goussians display. Of the original 8 classified Goussians, 6 fit the ‚Äúpod‚Äù morphology.Dykov√°, I., & Lom, J. (1981). Fish coccidia: critical notes on life cycles, classification and pathogenicity. Journal of Fish Diseases, 4(6), 487‚Äì505. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.1981.tb01161.x As of this writing, the genera consists of 59 individual species. Description Physiology Goussians share a similar morphology, with certain characteristics remaining widely conserved throughout the genera. In general goussians have thin walled oocysts lacking a micropyle, which contain four bivalved sporocysts. The two valves composing the sporocyst are identical and have a single longitudinal joint running along the midline. In some specific species there is a dual membrane structure which is associated with the joint. These associated membranes are quite delicate and can be difficult to observe under an electron microscope as the fixation process often leads to damage or the full destruction of this membranous structure.Jirk≈Ø, M, Modr√Ω D, ≈†lapeta JR, Koudela B & Luke≈° J (2002). The Phylogeny of Goussia and Choleoeimeria (Apicomplexa; Eimeriorina) and the Evolution of Excystation Structures in Coccidia. Protist 153(4) 379‚Äì390. https://doi.org/10.1078/14344610260450118. As do many apicomplexans, Goussia feature a conical shaped structure towards the apical end of their cells made of fibers, which are currently unknown, that surround the rhoptries. The conoid is thought to have a mechanical function and assist in the entrance into host cells in order to form a characteristic parasitophorous vacuole.Morrissette NS, & Sibley LD (2002) Cytoskeleton of Apicomplexan Parasites. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 66(1) 21‚Äì38 https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.66.1.21-38.2002R Rhopteries and micronemes are located below the conoid in the apical end of the cell. These two organelles have a unique secretory function and aid in the adhesion to enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract. This ensures that Goussia is able to gain substantial access to host cells, before being passed through the host with the feces.Morrissette NS, & Sibley LD (2002) Cytoskeleton of Apicomplexan Parasites. Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews 66(1) 21‚Äì38. https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.66.1.21-38.2002 Members of the genera Goussia also retain an apical polar ring, which act as microtubule organizing centers in the cell and apicoplasts, which are specialized plastids involved in various synthesis activities carried out by the cell, (heam, lipids etc). It has been noted that the destruction of the apicoplast does not immediately kill the cell, but it prevents it from infecting other host cells. Apicoplasts are currently being investigated as a potential drug target to treat apicomplexans; due to the fact that it is derived from previously photosynthetic algae, herbicidal medications may be able to effectively treat these parasitic conditions without harming any of the host metabolic processes.Bott√© CY, Dubar F, McFadden GI, Mar√©chal E & Biot C (2012) Plasmodium falciparum Apicoplast Drugs: Targets or Off-Targets? Chemical Reviews 112(3) 1269‚Äì1283. https://doi.org/10.1021/cr200258w History In 1896 Labb√© described two new protist genera - Goussia and Crystallospora - which only remained distinct genera up until 1909, at which time both Crystallospora and Goussia were reduced to synonyms of Eimeria. Around 1920 other protistologists used the term Goussia as a generic term to refer to new species. Subsequently, by 1953, Goussia began to somewhat re-emerge, and by some, was now classified as a subgenera of Eimeria but was later relegated to an Eimerial synonym once again. Currently, Goussia and Eimeria are widely considered to be separate genera, with the presence of a Stieda body being characteristic of Eimeria. Stiedal bodies are microscopic organelles located at the polar regions of the cell and act as plugs, keeping the sporocyst‚Äôs occluding holes closed until the sporozoites are ready to be released. As it stands there are some piscine coccidia which lack Stiedal bodies and are part of other related genera. These will likely be remedied at some point and these organisms will see new classification under the genre Goussia. Lifecycle As Goussians are members of the Coccidians, they exhibit merogany, gamogany and sporogoany, and in representative infections, which are both homoxenous and occur in the gastro intestinal tract of the host, all three lifecycle stages, with the exception of the motile zoites may be observed at all stages of the tract; no particular lifecycle stage is strongly associated with any gross anatomical feature of the host.Gestal, C., & Azevedo, C. (2005). Ultrastructure of Goussia cruciata (Apicomplexa: Coccidia) infecting the liver of horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus (L.), from Ibero-Atlantic waters. Journal of Fish Diseases, 28(3), 125‚Äì132. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2005.00611.x The vast majority of parasitic cells are localized to the anterior of the intestines, as cell lingering towards the posterior are expulsed from the host with the feces, ready to begin looking for another host. Initially infection occurs with the motile zoite phase of the lifecycle. These cells direct their apical cell apparatus towards the host‚Äôs enterocytes and proceed to enter the cells so that their lifecycles may continue. Once physically inside the host‚Äôs enterocytes, Goussia localizes in the cell between the cytoplasm and the cell membrane, this particular localization is referred to as extracytoplasmic. Extracytoplasmic localization has two sub stages which occur, the first stage being referred to as ‚Äúmonopodial‚Äù and the second stage being referred to as ‚Äúspider-like‚Äù. The monopodial stage occurs on the luminal side of the enterocyte and is characterized by a very close association between the hosts cell membrane and the host derived parasitophorous vacuole membrane, and a single large area of contact with the host cells cytoplasm; thus lending to the name ‚Äúmonopodial‚Äù. The spider-like stage is similar to the monopodial stage in that there is a close association of both the host cell membrane and the parasitophorous membrane, however, as opposed to a single large cytoplasmic contact site, there are many more contact sites which tend to be much more filose in morphology. Hosts While largely confined to freshwater fish as hosts, some members of Goussia parasitize fish which swim in brackish waters, and others have abandoned fish all together in favour of amphibians and reptiles, such as reed frogs or common geckos. And while the vast majority of Goussia lifecycles are homoxenous, there have been a few examples of heteroxenous lifecycles which utilize tubifex worms as a sort of vector.Steinhagen D & K√∂rting W (1990) The Role of Tubificid Oligochaetes in the Transmission of Goussia carpelli. The Journal of Parasitology, 76(1), 104‚Äì107. https://doi.org/10.2307/3282636 Ecology Found globally, Goussians are limited in that they need some sort of water source, both to mature in their sporogamy stage, and to be transmitted from host to host. The majority of its identified hosts are freshwater fish. Phylogeny Proper taxonomic categorization of Goussia has been a challenge ever since the genera‚Äôs inception. This is due in part to the various similarities shared between Goussia and Eimeria including, similar hosts, lifecycle progression and general cell structure. Although the structure of the oocyst in Eimeria can be used as a distinct morphological feature to help identify members of the genus the same is not true for members of Goussia. Goussian oocysts are quite variable and are in no way an exact predictor of taxonomic classification, but at the very least if the species in question lacks the distinctive Eimerian oocyst, than it may reasonably suggest that the species could be a member of Goussia.Jirk≈Ø M, Jirk≈Ø, M, Oborn√≠k M, Luke≈° J, & Modr√Ω D (2009). Goussia Labb√©, 1896 (Apicomplexa, Eimeriorina) in Amphibia: Diversity, Biology, Molecular Phylogeny and Comments on the Status of the Genus. Protist, 160(1), 123‚Äì136. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.protis.2008.08.003 As mentioned above stideal bodies also help in the classification of new species under the goussian genera, however these structures are quite small and rely on electron microscopy to be seen. In the classification of new species it would be most prudent to rely more on DNA technologies to differentiate between different species.

State Of Punjab (1967 AIR 1643, 1967 SCR (2) 762), or simply the Golaknath case, was a 1967 Indian Supreme Court case, in which the Court ruled that Parliament could not curtail any of the Fundamental Rights in the Constitution.L. C. Golaknath V. State Of Punjab Facts The family of Henry and William Golak Nath held over 500 acres of farmland in Jalandhar, Punjab. In the phase of the 1953 Punjab Security and Land Tenures Act, the state government held that the brothers could keep only thirty acres each, a few acres would go to tenants and the rest was declared 'surplus'. This was challenged by the Golak Nath family in the courts and the case was referred to the Supreme Court in 1965. The family filed a petition under Article 32 challenging the 1953 Punjab Act on the ground that it denied them their constitutional rights to acquire and hold property and practice any profession (Articles 19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g)) and to equality before and equal protection of the law (Article 14). They also sought to have the Seventeenth Amendment - which had placed the Punjab Act in the Ninth Schedule - declared ultra vires. The issues involved were whether Amendment is a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù under the meaning of Article 13(3)( a), and whether Fundamental Rights can be amended or not. Judgement The judgement reversed Supreme Court's earlier decision which had upheld Parliament's power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to Fundamental Rights. The judgement left Parliament with no power to curtail Fundamental Rights. The Supreme Court, by thin majority of 6:5, held that a constitutional amendment under Article 368 of the Constitution was an ordinary 'law' within the meaning of Article 13(3) of the Constitution. The majority did not believe there was any difference between ordinary legislative power of the parliament and the inherent constituent power of parliament to amend the Constitution. The majority did not agree with the view that Article 368 of the Constitution contained \\"power and procedure\\" to amend, but instead believed that the text of Article 368 only explained the procedure to amend the constitution, the power being derived from entry 97 of the List I of the VII Schedule to the Constitution. Since according to Article 13(2), the parliament could not make any law that abridges the Fundamental Rights contained in Part III of the Constitution, a constitutional amendment, also being an ordinary law within the meaning of Article 13, could not be in violation of the fundamental rights chapter contained in the Constitution of India. Therefore, all constitutional amendments thus far which were in contravention or which had made an exception to fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution were said to be void. =The Doctrine of Prospective Overruling= It was in this case that the then Chief Justice Koka Subba Rao had first invoked the doctrine of prospective overruling. He had taken import from American law where jurists like George F. Canfield, Robert Hill Freeman, John Henry Wigmore and Benjamin N. Cardozo had considered this doctrine to be an effective judicial tool. In the words of Canfield, the said expression means: :\\"........ a court should recognize a duty to announce a new and better rule for future transactions whenever the court has reached the conviction that an old rule (as established by the precedents) is unsound even though feeling compelled by stare decisis to apply the old and condemned rule to the instant case and to transactions which had already taken place\\". Taking cue from such formulation, Justice Subba Rao used this doctrine to preserve the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, legality of which had been challenged. He drew protective cover offered by the doctrine over the impugned amendments while manifestly holding that the impugned amendments abridged the scope of fundamental rights. Justifying his stand, he held that: :What then is the effect of our conclusion on the instant case? Having regard to the history of the amendments, their impact on the social and economic affairs of our country and the chaotic situation that may be brought about by the sudden withdrawal at this stage of the amendments from the Constitution, we think that considerable judicial restraint is called for. We, therefore, declare that our decisions will not affect the validity of the constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act, 1964, or other amendments made to the Constitution taking away or abridging the fundamental rights. We further declare that in future Parliament will have no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights.Prospective Overrulingn - Author - M.V. Pratap Kumar =Minority view= The judges who delivered the minority judgement in the Golaknath case dissented with the view of the invocation of the doctrine of prospective overruling. They seemed to rest their argument on the traditional Blackstonian theory, where they said that courts declare law and a declaration being the law of the land takes effect from the date the law comes into force. They further said that it would be loathsome to change the above principle and supersede it by the doctrine of prospective overruling. It is submitted here that the doctrine of prospective overruling in anyway does not supersede the already existing doctrine but simply tries to enrich the existing and rather complex practice with regard to the effects of new judicial decisions, by the adoption of an alternative discretionary device to be employed in appropriate cases. So, the basic characteristics of the above doctrine are the flexibility of content and fitfulness of occurrence. Significance Parliament passed the 24th Amendment in 1971 to abrogate the Supreme Court judgement. It amended the Constitution to provide expressly that Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution including the provisions relating to Fundamental Rights. This was done by amending articles 13 and 368 to exclude amendments made under article 368, from article 13's prohibition of any law abridging or taking away any of the Fundamental Rights. In 1973, the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala held that the Parliament under the Indian Constitution is not supreme, in that it cannot change the basic structure of the constitution.V. Venkatesan, Revisiting a verdict Frontline (vol. 29 - Issue 01 :: 14‚Äì27 January 2012) It also declared that in certain circumstances, the amendment of fundamental rights would affect the basic structure and therefore, would be void. Thus, one can see that this case is drawn on a larger canvas as compared to that of Golaknath. It also overruled Golaknath and thus, all the previous amendments which were held valid are now open to be reviewed. They can also be sustained on the ground that they do not affect the basic structure of the constitution or on the fact that they are reasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights in public interest. Both the cases, if seen closely, bear the same practical effects. What Golaknath said was that the Parliament cannot amend so as to take away the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III, whereas in Keshavananda, it was held that it cannot amend so as to affect the basic structure.

Background The rule of Mary of Guise as Regent of Scotland was challenged by the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Guise obtained French military support, and the Lords invited an English army under the terms of their Treaty of Berwick (1560). Just a few days before the conflict began to centre on the Siege of Leith, there was a battle at Glasgow. The battle According to a French journal of events, the foot soldiers of the Congregation left Fife for Glasgow on 3 March 1560. The leader of the Lords of the Congregation, the former Regent Arran, left Glasgow for Hamilton on 17 March 1560, leaving 25 men in the Bishop's Palace and 13 in the Steeple of the Cathedral. Henri Cleutin, sieur de Villeparisis, led his French troops to Glasgow in the morning of 18 March. The mounted French Harquebusiers were resisted by 70 Scots commanded by a son of the Earl of Glencairn. This party had remained in Glasgow to destroy provisions left behind during the evacuation. Twice the French and Scots fought at the bridge, but finally the Scots were drawn into the open and 'cut to pieces.' The others were taken prisoner, and the leaders hanged. Mercy was offered to any of the rest who renounced the Congregation. Later in the afternoon the garrison in the Palace and Steeple surrendered under terms.Dickinson, Gladys, ed., Two Missions of de la Brosse, SHS (1942), 81, 85-87. This French account of the battle is confirmed by a letter from Arran to Norfolk. Arran said he had left a garrison at Glasgow to buy 48 hours time. When the French entered the Castle they ignited gunpowder in one of the towers by accident and 13 were killed. Arran said there were 30 Scots fighting at the bridge who killed 8 Frenchmen.Calendar of the State Papers relating to Scotland and Mary Queen of Scots 1547-1603, H.M. General Register House Edinburgh, vol. 1, ed. J. Bain, (1898) no. 694, p.336. The French then returned to Leith shadowed by 800 Scots horsemen led by James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran.

History The race was started in 1977 by Finnish sculptor and running guru Eino Romppanen, more frequently known as Eino,Eino Stone Sculptor Bio  Eino to honor his friend Lasse Vir√©n, who had just completed the 5 and 10 double double in the Olympics (winning both the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres races in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics).Running with the legends - Google Books Viren had re-captured the Finnish tradition preceded by Hannes Kolehmainen and Paavo Nurmi of the \\"Flying Finn\\" which Eino wanted to celebrate. 1978 was a pivotal year in \\"amateur sports\\" in general and road running specifically. Over the previous years, athletes were revolting from the financial limitations of their amateur status. They wanted to be able to accept prize money openly. Following the 1972 Olympics, many elite track athletes created and ran in the professional International Track Association, which caused them to lose their Olympic eligibility. At the same time, millions of Americans were enthused by Frank Shorter's 1972 Olympic Marathon victory and were taking to running road races, a phenomenon known as the \\"Running Boom.\\" By 1978, the athlete's revolt led to the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, breaking the Amateur Athletic Union's regulation of the collection of sports they had governed and the replacement governing body The Athletics Congress, as domestic representatives of the interests of the IAAF and IOC were resisting ways to open the door for professionalism against the tide of commercial interests who wanted capitalize on the popularity of the sport. In Road running, a new organization called the \\"Association of Road Racing Athletes\\" (known as the ARRA) was formed to create a professional road racing circuit. Among the 6 charter events of the circuit was the Lasse Viren Finnish Invitational, offering $30,000 in prize money. A coterie of notable and heretofore well-paid - 07.06.81 - SI Vault The prize money attracted a virtual who's who of elite road runners of the day, including Viren himself.

Through the end of the 1980s, the race was one of the major running races on the circuit. The 1988 edition of the race was televised nationally on ESPN. But competition from other events made the sponsorship dollars harder to get. Local race A key element, starting with Eino's first race, was the local community race. This event attracted the road running community from throughout the greater southern California areahttp://jplrunners.org/News+Information/OffnRunning/OffnRunning1985/OffnRunning1985Nov.pdf to what is otherwise a decidedly rural location in order to watch some of the best runners in the world.

The stadium's newly installed AstroTurf was unharmed, but some of the light towers on the west side‚Äîwhich had recently been fitted with extra lights for the color telecast of the All- America Game‚Äîwere bent or snapped off. Even with the surrounding circumstances, the inaugural Jones Stadium game drew 42,150 in attendance, a record attendance over any prior Coaches All-America Game in Buffalo or Atlanta. The game finally found success by an attendance standard, drawing 285,786 attendees over 7 years. By the time of the final Coaches All-America Game in 1976, more players declined to participate in the college all-star game as National Football League rookies and NFL owners had little to gain, and much to lose due to injury risks. The AFCA reluctantly dropped the Coaches All-America Game, but continued to bestow All-American honors.

Life He was born at Powerscourt, County Wicklow, the son of Lieutenant-colonel Henry Monck Mason of Kildare Street, Dublin, by his second wife, Jane, only daughter of Bartholomew Mosse, M.D. After attending schools at Portarlington and Dublin he entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1793, was elected scholar in 1796, and on graduating B.A. in 1798 was awarded the gold medal.Trinity College registers At college he was contemporary with Thomas Moore the poet, and afterwards met him during visits to Kilkenny. In 1800 he was called to the Irish bar, but did not seek practice. Instead he held the post of examiner to the prerogative court. In 1814 he was appointed assistant librarian of King's Inns, and became chief librarian in 1815. In conjunction with Bishop Daly, Mason founded, in 1818, the \\"Irish Society for Promoting the Education of the Native Irish through the Medium of Their Own Language\\". He acted as its secretary for many years, besides writing several tracts in furtherance of its objectives. The same year he assisted in organising an association for the improvement of prisons and of prison discipline in Ireland, and in 1819 he wrote a pamphlet on the objects of the association. He likewise visited the prisons with a view to reclaiming first offenders. In 1851 Mason resigned the librarianship of King's Inns, and gave up his house in Henrietta Street, Dublin, to spend the remainder of his days at Bray, County Wicklow. He died there on 14 April 1858, and was buried in the old cemetery of Powerscourt Demesne. In 1816 he married Anne, daughter of Sir Robert Langrishe, by whom he had two sons and four daughters.The Gentleman's Magazine, 1858, part 1, p. 570 At Mason's suggestion the committee of the Irish Society founded in 1844 two Bedell scholarships and a premium in Dublin University for encouraging the study of the Irish language. He was mainly instrumental in the establishment there of a professorship of Irish. In 1812 he was elected member of the Royal Irish Academy. In the summer session of 1817 the degrees of LL.B. and LL.D. were conferred on him by Dublin University. He was a good musician; he composed several pretty airs, and was a fair violoncellist. His lack of tact saw him become embroiled in several disputes, for example with Owen Connellan.

There are several villages in the state which share this name; this article is about the village in Tuticorin District at Vagulagiri hill. The village is also called Marthandam Karungulam for the Lord Marthandeswara temple located at the entrance of the village on its northern border. The village is chiefly notable for its temples. Administration Karungulam village in Tuticorin District, and has been under this jurisdiction since the bifurcation of Tirunelveli District. Geography The Thamiraparani river flows on the eastern side of Karungulam village parallel to the Tirunelveli‚ÄìTiruchendur high road. Vagulagiri is a small hillock situated on the southern bank of Thamparapani, on the northeastern side of the village. It is said to have gained its name from vagulam flowers which once covered the hill. Religion and culture Veneration is important to many of the people of Karungulam and those who visit the village and surrounding region. Some believe that the Pushkarani water of Tirupati flows into the Thamiraparani river, making it sacred. Temples line both sides of the river along the Tirunelveli‚ÄìTiruchendur road, and people bathe in the river to purify their sins before going for darshan at Vagulagiri. The village is near the Adichanallur where ancient people lived. Many burial urns protrude from the ground portion of Kotai Vasal. Coins and mud vessels have been unearthed during excavations for new construction. Karungulam is sometimes called Marthandam Karungulam for the Lord Marthandeswara temple located at the entrance of the village on its northern border. The unique feature of this temple is that the Navagrahas are depicted with their wives, suggesting that it is very old. A Navadurga (nine forms of Durga) temple unique to Tamil Nadu is located near the Marthandeswara temple. The nine durgas are ≈öhailaputrƒ´, BrahmachƒÅri·πáƒ´, Chandragha·πá·π≠ƒÅ, Kushmanda, SkandamƒÅtƒÅ, KƒÅrtyƒÅyanƒ´, KƒÅlarƒÅtrƒ´, MahƒÅgaurƒ´ and SiddhidƒÅtrƒ´. The Vagulari temple atop Vagulagiri hill enshrines its main deity, Lord Venkatachalapathy, in the form of two sticks (tharkals) made of sandalwood. Depictions of Lords Venkatesa and Srinivasa overlook the village and some believe that the figures protect the villagers from evils, communicable diseases and other dangers. The sticks are removed from the temple and used to drive the car in the temple car festival. The Chithirai festival attracts many devotees. Puratasi Sani Garuda Sevai is celebrated in the Saturdays of Puratasi, and the Pavithrothsavam festival is celebrated for three days in July. Other temples surround the village. Sri Santhanamari Amman temple is managed by the Vadava community and located at the southern border. Sri Vadakku Vasal Selvi is at the northeastern border; Sri Angala Eshvari is at the western border. It is believed that many Siddas have lived in Vagulagiri and that some are still living in Sukshma and Sthula forms. Rishi Agathiyar has visited this hill several times. =Vagulagiri Mahatmiam= Vagulagiri Mahatmiam is a small recorded palm chuvadi in which the existence of gods at Vagulagiri hill are depicted. The Krantham scripts explaining the consecration of the Vagulagiri Lords were translated into Tamil by the Sanskrit scholar Brammasri K. Venkatachala Sastrigal. This sthhala purana (scholarly work on a place or temple) provides an insight into local history and customs. According to this work, King Subakandan of Kalharam in the ancient country of Baagligam was suffering from a terrible illness and could find no medical relief. Subakandan turned to his faith in the deity of the seven hills, Venkatachalapathy. He went to Tiruppathy where he performed prayers, penances and arathanas, and eventually received a vision of the deity. The vision instructed Subakandan to erect a chariot of sandalwood. Two sticks of sandalwood were leftover, in which Venkatachalapathy would remain. Subakandan fulfilled a request to take these sticks to the hill at Karungulam and consecrated the sticks between a holy tamarind tree and the Sri Srnivasa temple. Venkatachalapathy was then worshipped at the temple alongside Sri Srnivasa.

His debut album Whisky And Wool will be released on March 7, 2011 on NewTide Records. His track 'The River Song' was featured recently in a TV advert for Jack Wills. Biography Josh Bray was born in Devon and raised in the north of Dorset. Whilst at Bristol UWE and living on his brother's sofa, the two Brays had something of an Epiphany whilst watching the Nick Drake documentary, A Skin Too Few. Inspired by the songs featured in that film, the Bray brothers began to unpick the playing style of, at first, Nick Drake and subsequently, the plethora of British folk revival talent that was revealed to them in the course of their studies. And so it was, that whilst at Law School, Bray began to record his idea in to his Tascam 4 track tape recorder and place them on the then pre eminent social platform, Myspace. It was there that a private investor convinced Bray to drop his studies and make an album so inspired was he by the results of Bray's dabblings. The resulting album was Whisky & Wool. It was recorded in the winter of 2009 by The Bennet Brothers of Truck Festival fame and featured many of the Oxford scenes brightest talents as guest performers. Bray subsequently embarked on the album's promotional work and performed for a number of years around the UK and Europe, supporting the likes of The Parlotones, Matthew Morrison, and Jon Allen, as well as touring solo in the clubs, pubs and festivals of the UK. He was featured on the Zoe Ball, Dermot O'Leary and Aled Jones shows on BBC Radio 2 as a live performer and on the Geoff Lloyd show on Absolute Radio. He also performed on BBC London for Robert Elms and Jo Goode and has been played on all major UK radio stations. Bray had previously delighted in the world of grunge, punk, metal and post hardcore. Bands such as Alice in Chains, American Football, Rites of Spring, Deftones and Rage Against the Machine and subsequent to Whisky & Wool, Bray craved the harder, darker edge of the bands of his youth. It was with this in mind that Bray formed alt/indie outfit The BlackWhite with the members of his touring band. The BlackWhite self produced and released their Food for the Mouthless EP in 2014 before disbanding.

Later calculations indicated it to be part of the Kreutz Sungrazing group. A curious feature of the comet was that few, if any observations were made of a cometary head or nucleus. As a result, some older astronomical texts refer to it as the \\"Headless Wonder\\".Bortle, J. The Bright Comet Chronicles, International Comet Quarterly, 1998 Discovery The comet was officially discovered by astronomer John Macon Thome at C√≥rdoba, Argentina, on January 19, at which point it was located in the constellation Grus.Kronk, G. W. Cometography, v2, CUP, 2003, p.588 However, correspondence from William Henry Finlay suggests that it may also have been seen from Blauwberg, South Africa, on January 18. At the time of discovery the comet had already passed perihelion a week earlier, and its closest approach to Earth had been a month earlier. Observations The comet reached first magnitude,Milani, De Martino & Cellino (eds) Asteroids, comets, meteors 1993: proceedings of the 160th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union, held in Belgirate, Italy, June 14‚Äì18, 1993, Springer, 1994, p.8 and was widely observed by astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere for the remainder of January. On the 22nd Finlay described it as a \\"pale narrow ribbon of light, quite straight\\" of about 35 degrees in length, though no cometary head could be distinguished.Kronk, p.589 On the 23rd, Thome recorded a tail length of over 40 degrees, but like other observers stated he could not find a nucleus. On January 27, C. Todd recorded seeing the comet's head as a \\"diffused nebulous mass\\", but noted a break between the head and the tail (possibly representing what is referred to as a tail disconnection event). Following the publication of an ephemeris by S. C. Chandler, which suggested the comet could be located 20¬∞ from Rigel by the end of February, astronomers in the United States eagerly waited for it to move far enough into northern skies to be visible.\\"Lost Tramp of the Skies - The Great Southern Comet Disappears\\", New York Times, February 27, 1887 However, the comet faded extremely rapidly, and never became visible from northern latitudes. It was last observed by John Tebbutt from New South Wales on January 30, a relatively short period of observation overall for a large comet. Analysis The first, speculative, orbit was calculated by Heinrich Kreutz; however definitive calculation was difficult because no observations were made of the nucleus. By February, Finlay had derived an orbit which linked the comet firmly to the Kreutz Sungrazing group. A more definitive orbit was calculated in 1978 by Zdenƒõk Sekanina, based on the assumption that the comet's head was on a great circle \\"through the sun and inner part of the tail\\".Kronk, p.591 Sekanina was subsequently to speculate that the unusual appearance of the comet was due to a \\"tail formation event\\", an outburst of cometary dust, about 6 hours after perihelion.Sekanina, Z.

LASCO has been chaired by Thierry Libaert and Fran√ßois Lambotte; since 2015, it is chaired by Andrea Catellani. The LASCO brings together researchers of different origins, united by the common aim of observing and analysing internal and external, strategic and spontaneous phenomena in the field of Organizational Communication, Public Relations, Corporate Communication and Strategic Communication. Such phenomena are to be considered as the origins and consequences of interactions occurred within organizations, or produced by them. The LASCO originated from the consistent continuation of work done inside the Communication Department in the Public Relations sector (from 1961 onwards, via the CETEDI, Centre of Diffusion Techniques and Public Relations) and of Institutional Mediation (from 1994 on). Correlations between communication and organizations have always constituted a traditional research field at the Communication Department at UCLouvain.

It also allows for this limit to be increased by statutory instrument, which would require the approval of the House of Commons (though not if it is raised simply to take into account any exchange rate fluctuations between the pound and the Euro that might occur between 9 December 2010 and 20 January 2011).Loans to Ireland Act 2010 The Act also requires the Treasury to publish a report about the loans as soon as is practicable after 30 March 2011 (and every sixth months thereafter). The report must include details of: *any payments made by the Treasury by way of a loan in that period, *any sums received by the Treasury in that period by way of repayment of principal or the payment of interest in respect of a loan, *the aggregate amount of principal and interest in respect of loans which is outstanding at the end of that period, *the remaining term of each loan which is outstanding at the end of that period, and *the original term of each loan in respect of which a payment was made by the Treasury by way of a loan in that period. Once the loans are fully repaid, no report has to be made.  Name for Irish State  The British and Irish governments had a dispute over their respective states' names that lasted about 60 years. It ended with the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Both governments now respect each side's name. The Act, given its title, is probably the clearest example of this rapprochement in British legislation. If equivalent legislation had been enacted before 1998, it would probably have been called the \\"Loans to the Republic of Ireland Act\\" but instead, the Irish side's official name is used throughout.

Written by Matt Dickinson, the series explores the world of chaos theory and the butterfly effect. Previous published works by Matt Dickinson have been The Death Zone (Random House 1997), High Risk, (Random House 1999) and Black Ice (Random House 2001). Mortal Chaos is inspired by the work of Edward Lorenz and Ray Bradbury's 1952 story \\"A Sound of Thunder\\", in which the concept of sensitive dependence on initial conditions is applied to time travel. Each novel in the series starts with the beating of a butterfly's wings and follows parallel (and simultaneous) stories set in different parts of the globe as a disaster unfolds. The films The Butterfly Effect, Babel and Crash employed a similar concept. The series is commissioned by OUP's children's division and will be edited by Liz Cross with managing editor Kathy Webb.

Feli√∫ oversaw the cession of Florida to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris on July 21, 1763 and the subsequent immigration of most of the province's Spanish and African inhabitants to Cuba. Some of the Native Americans living in the Spanish Catholic missions also moved away from Florida at this time.

University of West Florida. = Relations with Native Americans and strengthening defense of the colony= During his administration, Feli√∫, like his predecessors, continued to support the Franciscan missions established at various Native American villages, and tried to revive friendly relations with former indigenous allies that former Florida governor Lucas Fernando Palacios had broken, even granting Christian Native Americans the same rights as the colonists. Following the war between Spain and England, which had revealed the vulnerability of Florida to an English attack, Feli√∫ sought to improve the military readiness of the province. To supplement the ranks of the some 2,000 soldiers that the Florida militia could muster, Feli√∫ invited enslaved peoples in the British and French colonies of North America to escape to Florida and become Spanish citizens in exchange for joining Florida's militia, a stratagem that proved successful. Feli√∫ had the thick forest between Fort Mose and St. Augustine cut down to deprive the Native Americans of cover to launch their raids, saving five thousand suitable logs to use as stakes in constructing fortifications. He doubtless recruited lumberjacks from the Mose militiamen for this project, and assigned them to help raise the earthen defensive line from Fort Mose to the San Sebastian River. These black soldiers from Fort Mose helped build a stockaded fort where the line joined the San Sebastian, working alongside the moreno and pardo troops sent from Havana to help defend the city. = Engineers in St. Augustine = When Feli√∫ came to St. Augustine in 1762, he brought with him a military engineer by the name of Pablo Castell√≥. Castell√≥ and mission engineer Juan de Cotilla, who had returned to Florida in 1763, became important Spanish architects in the region. Cotilla was even instructed to assist Feli√∫ in organizing the departure of Spanish colonists from Florida. Spanish inhabitants of St. Augustine, as well as Feli√∫ himself, trusted Cotilla to assist in the sale of their properties. = Cession of Florida to Britain = On July 21, 1763, Feli√∫ signed the documents that ceded Florida to Great Britain by the 1763 Treaty of Paris.Flag ceremony.

The dam is about 6 km away from the downtown of Heyuan and 170 km away from Guangzhou. It is the largest lake in Guangdong covering an area of 370 km¬≤ and it has a storage capacity of 13.98 km¬≥. Xinfengjiang Reservoir is known for its clear and almost drinkable water, such as that used to produce the renowned Nongfu Spring brand of mineral water (Generally, it is provided South China). Otherwise, the lake, which is famous for the name of \\"Wanl√º Lake\\" (it means a wide green view in Chinese),is an important tourist attraction of Guangdong. History Guangdong is located in the area of Humid subtropical climate and full of water resource. Before 1958, the Xinfengjiang River is an important transport line in Heyuan and Xinfeng. Xinfengjiang Reservoir was founded in July, 1958 for preventing flood, regulating the river height and the shipping, irrigating the farm etc., and completed in 1969. At the time when it was built by the order of the local government, 6 towns and many villages were flooded. Thousands of local residents had to settle in other region, such as the higher land in Heyuan (it was a county at that time), Xinfeng, Longmen, Boluo, and so on. It was estimated that about 94311 outmigrated and 15524 were forced to move to the undisturbed mountains. The wealthiest area in former Heyuan County might be covered by water forever. In 1984, Guangdong government allowed the lake to be a tourist attraction. It became a national park in 1993, the name \\"Wanl√º Lake\\" was put forward to then. Water supply Xinfengjiang Reservoir was used to supply clear drinkable water to Heyuan since the time it was built. However, to prevent the water from pollution, the local industry was limited. In 2006, 6 members of parliament put forward a motion that Heyuan people are below the poverty line and wish to provide the wealthier Pearl River Delta with clear water. They held the belief that through selling water, the local residents' income may be improved. Then, there is a heated discussion among public. Some specialists proof the project's possibility. In Feb 2010, Xiaohua Liu, the mayor of Heyuan revealed that the project was passed, and the agreement between Heyuan and the seeking water cities was signed. \\"Through the piping system, Heyuan is able to supply 0.2 km¬≤ clear water to Shenzhen and 0.1 km¬≤ to Guangzhou every year\\", Liu said.

Role in Welsh tradition According to the Dream of Rhonabwy, Afaon fought alongside Arthur at the Battle of Badon as one of his chief counsellors. He recklessly rode past Arthur prior to the battle, splashing the king in his haste, and was rebuked by Elffin ap Gwyddno. Despite his recklessness, he was referred to by Iddog ap Mynio as \\"the wisest and most accomplished in the kingdom\\".Gantz, Jeffrey. The Mabinogion.

It was founded in 1818 in Dublin by members of the Church of Ireland and remained in existence until 1914. The main movers in setting up the society were Henry Joseph Monck Mason and Bishop Robert Daly.Bishop Robert Daly: Ireland's \\"Protestant pope\\" by Eugene Broderick, History Ireland. Its offices were located at 16 Upper Sackville St., Dublin. Mason acted as its secretary for many years, besides writing several tracts in furtherance of its objectives. The society claimed to be interdenominational and respect religious differences. However, the organisation's literature, often published to attract donations from England, demonstrates that the eventual objective was one of conversion. Missionaries liked to concentrate on aspects of the Bible which they believed contradicted Catholic teaching. Members of the society placed emphasis on education, which would allow the Irish natives access to the scriptures in Irish for the first time. A teaching mission was set up in the Kingscourt area of County Cavan, and the success of the venture encouraged the society to establish charity schools to promote education through the Irish language. Catholic teachers were employed, as few Protestants knew Irish. These teachers were prized for their local knowledge and the fact that they could draw upon networks of friends and family. However, school inspectors were Protestants. In 1835, the society reported that it had 514 salaried teachers and that over 14,000 pupils had been inspected. By 1844 the society reported that it had in place a system of elementary education in twenty-four counties, including schools, teachers, supervisors and delivery- men for religious literature. In 1849 it reported that it had distributed more than 30,000 books, mostly in Irish, to teachers and scholars. The Catholic church condemned the schools and those who worked in them. Sometimes violent conflicts arose between supporters and objectors. On occasions the police were needed at the funerals of converts and at public appearances by ministers who were converted priests. At Mason's suggestion the committee of the Irish Society founded in 1844 two Bedell scholarships and a premium in Dublin University for encouraging the study of the Irish language. He was mainly instrumental in the establishment there of a professorship of Irish. In 1848, the Irish Society in partnership with the controversial Irish Church Missions to Roman Catholics (ICM) undertook projects in Galway and Mayo. This was a difficult alliance due to the aggressive evangelical zeal of the ICM founder, Rev. Alexander Dallas, and his anti-Catholic tirades, which caused much bitterness in the areas, as well as with members of the Irish Society particularly in Trinity College. In 1861, the society was instrumental in the translation into Irish of the Book of Common Prayer / Leabhar na nUrnaighe Comhchoitchionn. The society existed until 1914, and in the early years of the 20th century during the Home Rule movement offered its belief in Scripture to solve issues. In the last 20 years of its existence it sold off its property and schools to survive.

It was opened in 1878 as part of the Cannons Railway (Kanonenbahn) from Berlin to Metz, but was closed in 1983. History  The 18.04 km long Lollar‚ÄìWetzlar line was built as a bypass for Gie√üen. The line separated in Lollar from the Main-Weser Railway coming from the north and ran directly to Wetzlar where the Cannons Railway continued over the Lahn Valley Railway to the west. This work was built under the leadership of Julius Lehwald. The initial survey work for the line were carried out in 1872, construction began on 1 July 1875 and was completed in July 1878. The line was officially opened on 15 October 1878. This line allowed the Cannons Railway to avoid the Gie√üen rail node. Because the line's main significance was military, it served none of the nearby localities. The line features very large radius curves and low grades. Some of the foundations of the bridges were designed to allow duplication of the track. The line joined the Dill line at a flying junction at Wetzlar freight yard. Passenger traffic on this line ceased on 30 May 1980. Freight traffic was closed between Lollar and Abendstern on 28 February 1983 to allow a bypass road to be built.

Early years Originally from the Basque Country, Ibarra joined the Spanish Army in his youth and eventually attained the rank of general. In 1549 or 1553 (sources differ), following the orders of Capt. Alonso de Mercadillo, he explored southern Zamora in Amazonian Ecuador, part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, and gave the Namb√≠ja (or Lambija) region its name.  Governor of La Florida  On 28 August 1603, English pirates seized two Spanish ships from Seville near Cayo Romano, (Cuba), on board one of which was newly appointed governor of La Florida, Pedro de Ibarra, who escaped that night on one of the damaged vessels and arrived in Havana after a perilous voyage of 32 days at sea. Ibarra then assumed office as governor of La Florida at St. Augustine on 20 October 1603. Ibarra, a career soldier with wide military experience, regarded maintaining the presidio's garrison and a vigilant watch for hostile intruders as his most important administrative duties. Upon his arrival in Florida, Ibarra was determined to improve relations with the aggrieved Guale Indians of the Atlantic coastal region north of St. Augustine. A few years previously they had rebelled against Spanish rule under Ibarra's predecessor, Gonzalo M√©ndez de Can√ßo, killing five Franciscan friars and destroying their missions in the uprising of 1597‚Äì1598 (also known as Juanillo's Revolt), with many Spanish soldiers also killed fighting to suppress the rebellion. Within two months of Ibarra's arrival, some forty leaders of the Guale had visited him in the Spanish capital to \\"render their obedience\\" to the new governor and to receive the presents that confirmed their subordinate relationship with him as representative of the Spanish king. In November and December 1604, Ibarra made a visita (official visit) to the Guale towns on the coast of present-day Georgia, where he listened to the native chiefs' complaints and settled disputes among them, as well as exhorting them to practice the Catholicism they had been taught by the missionaries. = Ais-Spanish alliance = In his official relations with the Indian inhabitants of La Florida, Ibarra employed the diplomacy of gift-giving expected by native chiefs, and even resorted to kidnapping Ais leaders to parley with them. The Ais were allowing English and French boats to land on their shores, which was considered a territorial violation by Spanish officials in St. Augustine, who believed these actions increased the chances of an enemy attack on the city from the south. Consequently, Ibarra sent an emissary to the Ais to make a treaty with their head chief, called \\"El Capit√°n Grande\\" by the Spanish. El Capit√°n Grande suggested that as a gesture of goodwill, the Spaniards and the Ais could exchange young boys who would then learn the other people's language. One of the Indians told the son of the Ais leader, however, that horses in St. Augustine ate people, scaring the boy so much that he fled St. Augustine. The Ais chief apologized, promising to send his son back to the Spanish town, then requested more gifts from the Spanish as a proof of their continued friendship. lbarra had tried for several years to get the chiefs of the Indian tribes south of St. Augustine to come to the provincial capital for peace talks, and finally, on September 2, 1605, El Capit√°n Grande arrived in St. Augustine, accompanied by the chiefs of Surruque and Urubia, and 20 other Indians of high status. Ibarra cordially welcomed and entertained them in his own home. The friendship of the Indians had been won. In the words of Ibarra, \\"Since then the Caciques come and go as they please, and our soldiers do the same, by sea as well as by land, with the greatest security.\\" In 1605, Ibarra sent a soldier-cartographer, Alvaro Mexia, on a diplomatic mission to the Ais, whose territory stretched from Cape Canaveral to the St. Lucie River. The mission was successful; the Ais agreed to protect the Spanish as far southward as their territory extended, and even to care for shipwrecked sailors in return for a ransom.The resulting peace allowed Mexia to complete a map of the Indian River area with the help of the Ais. =Capt. √âcija's expedition to Virginia= On 8 November 1608, Ibarra received orders via a royal c√©dula from Philip III to send a reconnaissance expedition to find Jamestown, Virginia; Ibarra did so, assigning the expedition's command to Capt. Francisco Fern√°ndez de √âcija. The governor instructed √âcija that if he found the Jamestown settlement abandoned, he should sail further north to investigate the location of the copper mines (which the Spanish believed to be a gold mine) mentioned by Champlain in his description of a visit to the present-day Minas Basin in 1603. =Franciscan convent and Hospital of Santa Barbara= In 1605, after the Franciscan convent in St. Augustine had been rebuilt, and the repairs and enlargement of the Hermita de Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad (Church of Our Lady of Solitude) were complete, Ibarra moved the Hospital of Santa Barbara (founded in January 1600 by the previous governor, Gonzalo M√©ndez de Can√ßo), and its patients back to its original location in the convent. The Hospital de Santa Barbara was the first hospital in what is now the continental United States. =Term of office as governor ends= Ibarra governed La Florida until 1610, when he was succeeded by Juan Fern√°ndez de Olivera.  Personal life  Upon Pedro de Ibarra's marriage to Ana de Unzueta, he was proclaimed Lord of the house of Unzueta in Eibar, province of Gipuzkoa, as can be read in an inscription encircled by a laurel wreath on his sepulchral monument at the Colegiata de Cenarruza (Collegiate Church of Cenarruza) or Ziortza (Basque), in Biscay.

It was a single engine, single-seat monoplane built in the hope of being selected by the French Navy. Two prototypes were built, but no production followed. Design and development In late 1932, the Soci√©t√© des Avions Bernard proposed to build a floatplane fighter to meet the requirements of the French Navy for a shipboard fighter suitable for operation from the catapults of its Battleships and Cruisers. The Bernard design, the H.52, was a mid- winged monoplane based on its Bernard 260 landplane fighter, using the same wings, rear fuselage and tail surfaces as the earlier design. It was of all- metal construction, principally duralumin, with a monocoque fuselage and stressed skin cantilever wings that were integrally constructed with the centre fuselage. Leading edge slots and large flaps were fitted to the wing to lower its landing speed, while its undercarriage consisted of two main floats. A single supercharged Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Kdrs radial engine powered the aircraft Flight 22 November 1934, p. 1245. The first of two prototypes flew on 16 June 1933, with the second flying in 1934. No production followed, with Bernard choosing to develop a new fighter to meet the requirements of the French Navy, the Bernard H.110. This had a similar layout, with wooden wings and a more powerful engine fitted, but had no more success in attracting orders than the H.52, the French Navy eventually selecting the Loire 210.

The loss of the well-subscribed part- and full-time courses deprived the college of a vital source of revenue. The College thereafter received no Bar Council validation to run the new, unified Practitioners' Bar Vocational Course (BVC), which required audio-recording studio-facilities for training in practical advocacy, conference and negotiation skills. The school then moved to a site along the A206 (Woolwich Road), close to the Thames Barrier, in Charlton Riverside in South-East London. The building of 1894-96 had been previously used by Maryon Park School and had been extended twice, first in 1909‚Äì10, then in 1914-15.Saint & Guillery, The Survey of London vol. 48: Woolwich, page 127. Yale, 2012 (online PDF, pp. 55-57). In 2005 the college became part of Kaplan Inc., one of the largest international private education providers. Kaplan every year provided education and training to a million students across 30 countries. In March 2013, the college rebranded from \\"Holborn College\\" to \\"Kaplan Holborn College\\". Kaplan Holborn College specialised in law and business, offering foundation, undergraduate, top-up and postgraduate courses in association with leading UK universities such as Anglia Ruskin University and the University of the West of England. The college had a diverse mix of students from the UK and the rest of the world, in particular from Africa, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe. There was no on-site accommodation provision for students under 18; most students stayed in two nearby hostels or with host families.Holborn College - Ofsted Reports, 16 November 2004. Three- and four-year undergraduate degrees last cost ¬£5,995 per annum. Two-year degrees were charged at ¬£9,000. In 2012 the Woolwich Road premises were acquired by Greenwich Council and turned into a primary school. The college continued at Borough High Street. Kaplan Holborn College had received a commendable outcome from the QAA in June 2013.Kaplan Holborn College June 2013 QAA Review However, in September 2015 Kaplan Holborn College closed its Borough High Street campus.Kaplan to shut Borough High Street‚Äôs Holborn College on london-se1.co.uk, 30 April 2015. The old school building at Woolwich Road is now used by Windrush Primary School. On the adjacent former playgrounds of this school new buildings were constructed for the short-lived Royal Greenwich University Technical College, which opened in 2013. In 2016 this became Royal Greenwich Trust School.

Background Lombok lies immediately east of Bali and approximately the same size, however, its climate and terrain differ. The majority of the island's population is the central plain between the mountainous north and the barren, arid south. Lombok's west has a large immigrant Balinese population and their houses and temples are similar to those of Bali. The Muslim and animist Sasak majority live in the drier eastern part of the island. Their houses rise in tiers up the hot bare hills of Lombok's southern peninsula. The majority of the traditional houses in the more developed parts of the island are no longer used. However, in the southern part of the island they are still lived in as most villagers cannot afford to change their way of life, but also because they are proud of their culture and as tourism increases there is a financial incentive to maintain the structures. Villages are clustered on low escarpments to conserve arable land. A village is approached via a path leading to a narrow gateway, and the village rises to the crown of the hill with a few lateral paths and many zig-zagging trails accessing houses. A thatched roof mosque with a square pyramid or double pyramid mosque forms the centre of the village. Lumbung rice barn Lumbung Pile-built, bonnet-rice barns known as lumbung are the pride of Sasak vernacular architecture. They are built in rows along the easier lower paths of a village. The structures have only one opening, which is a high window into which rice is loaded twice a year. Four 1.5 metre hardwood posts are mounted on a level, sundried mud and buffalo-dung platform, and discs known as jelepreng are set towards the top to prevent rodent ingress. Two lateral beams are carried by the posts on which sits a cantilevered frame which in turn supports the bamboo rafters. Several lumbung owned by separate families are built end to end a few metres apart.

Life =1731‚Äì1798= He was born in the Kingdom of Naples and entered the Knights Hospitaller whilst still young, being sent to Malta aged 12 as a page of honour to Grand Master Emmanuel Pinto. At the end of his time as a page, he was attached to the 'caravans on the sea', in which he was recognised as one of the Order's best sailors. He was later made commander in chief of the Order's navy. He was also a freemason, being the founder member of a lodge with seven other knights of the Order of Malta (two of those seven were later made Grand Cross of the Order - the count of Litta, Grand Master Rohan's close friend Abel de Loras). Tommasi was decorated with Order's grand cross, entered its grand council and was entrusted with one important administrative role in the order after another. After bailli Mazei's death, in 1784, Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany made Tommasi minister to the Grand Master. =1798‚Äì1803= In 1798, however, Bonaparte captured Malta and grand master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim abdicated. Tommasi and the other knights were forced to leave the island and were scattered across Europe. An important section of the order regrouped in Russia and chose Paul I of Russia as Grand Master, but the pope did not recognise this election since he felt that the order could not be led by a married Russian Orthodox man who had never belonged to the order. On Paul's death, his son Alexander I of Russia decided to end this irregular situation and refused to be Grand Master. In the meantime the British had captured Malta and the Allied nations had agreed to re-establish the order, still dispersed across Europe and Russia and so unable to gather for a general assembly. The election of a new Grand Master was thus (for this instance only) deferred to the pope (then pope Pius VII), with each priory presenting a candidate to him - Tommasi (then in exile in Messina) was one of these candidates. In the meantime, in September 1802, Pius had offered the post to bailli Bartolomeo Ruspoli (born 1754), a Roman prince who had been general of the order's galleys for four years, but Ruspoli was then in Scotland and declined the post. A second consistory chose Tommasi as Grand Master on 9 February 1803, on the recommendation of Alexander I and the Ferdinand, king of Naples, and he was appointed on 11 March the same year. =1803‚Äì1805= Straight after his appointment Tommasi sent the commander de Bussy to Malta to demand the British evacuate the island in line with article 10 of the treaty of Amiens and hand over the government palace in the fort at Valletta. The British governor Alexander Ball replied on 2 March 1803 that some powers were still not recognising Malta's independence and so Britain was authorised to continue basing troops on the island and that the government palace (occupied by British civil servants) could not be vacated. Ball recognised that the Grand Master would be able to base himself at the Boschetta palace but that until this palace was furnished Tommasi should provisionally base himself on Sicily. In response Tommasi convoked a general assembly of the order in the order's church at Messina on 27 June 1803. After reading the assembly the papal bull regarding his own election as Grand Master, Tommasi requested that the Order show unity in order to guarantee its continued existence and its historic statutes. He then set up residence in Catania on Sicily, where he gathered the Order's chancellery and archives. The Augustinian convent was put at their disposal while Tommasi himself lived in a neighbouring palace, where he died on 13 June 1805 aged 74, after having named bailli Innico Maria Guevara-Suardo lieutenant of the order in his place. He was buried at Catania Cathedral and also commemorated at Cortona Cathedral, with the latter holding a cenotaph in his memory (several of his possessions are in the museum in Cortona). Suardo's nomination was confirmed by the pope and the Order's holy council and he held it from then until his death on 15 April 1814.

If the gas pressure of the plasma varies across the radius of the cylinder, a self-generated current will spontaneously arise within the plasma, due to collisions between trapped particles and passing particles. This current is called the bootstrap current, and is commonly found in tokamak fusion devices. The tokamak uses a combination of external magnets and a current driven in the plasma to create a stable confinement system. One goal of advanced tokamak designs is to maximize the bootstrap current, and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for an external current driver. This could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of the device. From an engineering point of view the bootstrap current is the effect of trapped particles (which practically lie on poloidal plane) and density gradient: the poloidal current due to trapped particles motion is unbalanced since the density is not constant, therefore the bootstrap current is needed to \\"close the circuit\\".

It was established in 1929 and closed down in 1978. It provided entertainment and leisure to people, catering especially to the middle and lower income groups of citizens in the past. History The amusement park was situated between Zion Road, River Valley Road and Kim Seng Road in the central part of Singapore. In the 1920s, the site was originally a Chinese cemetery. Taking reference to a map of Singapore in 1909, the place was actually covered with swampy marshes back then and a small canal actually run across the site, eventually meeting up with the Singapore River thereafter. The landowner, Lee Geok Kun (brother of philanthropist Lee Kong Chian), redeveloped the site into an amusement park in the 1930s. Business within Great World did not fulfil the expectations of the owners so in 1941, the park was sold to the Shaw Brothers who took over the operations of the park. Map of Singapore  Japanese occupation  Before the Shaw Brothers could make any interventions to their newly acquired park, the Japanese took control over Singapore during the second World War. The park was then converted into a Prisoner-Of-War (POW) camp that held captive the Australian soldiers from the Allied Forces. Eventually the park was instructed to resume its activities for the benefit of the Japanese soldiers. In order to make way for these activities, the POWs were shifted into shacks that were behind the park, out of access and sight from the park. Gambling activities, a favourite amongst the Japanese, were rampant in the park during this period.  After World War II  Following the war, Great World was given a makeover with most of its attractions as well as stalls revamped and upgraded. In 1958, the park had a grand opening here and Elizabeth Taylor, a famous actress back then, graced the event as she was performing at Sky Theatre's opening as well. It was a major talking point back then as many came down especially just to catch a glimpse of the actress in person. International Trade Fairs were also held within the park and it would fetch an record high attendance of 50,000 visitors. Some other events that were held there include the British Trade Fair, badminton matches, and even boxing matches. There was also a Japanese Circus there. There were a vast array of game stalls and shops in Great World as well, such as selling toys and children's clothes. The park attractions included four Shaw Brothers-run cinemas named Atlantic, Canton, Globe and Sky, a nightclub called Flamingo. Globe and Sky Theatres showcased mainly English films while Atlantic and Canton Theatres screened their films in either mandarin or cantonese. Films were second-run films thus they were available at an affordable price of 50cents per ticket. The Flamingo Night Club was also a common hang out spot among the wealthy individuals, paying homage to the group of caberet girls home to the night club. Famous restaurants and food stalls were not to be missed such as the famous Cantonese restaurant Wing Choon Yuen (now Spring Court) and Diamond, famous for its specialities like Sharks' fin and roasted pork, was a common spot for wedding banquets and functions. A handful of park attractions like the ferris wheel, carousel, and roller coaster rides were popular especially by the young kids. Peking Operas and wayang shows were popular amongst the older generation and they are shown on the stage there. There is the popular Ghost Train, which took one for a ride full and screams and shouts with the ghost and demons props hanging down along the journey inside a building. Film adaptation In 2010, director Kelvin Tong produced a film revolving around the amusement park. The two-million dollar film, It's A Great, Great World, based on the history of the park, was released theatrically on 27 January 2011, throughout Singapore.  1960s  As television gained popularity here from the 1960s onwards, people visited the park lesser thus business started to decline within Great World. Finally, the park had its last session opened to the people in 1964 and was subsequently sold off to Kuok Holdings in 1978. A retail shopping mall, Great World City which includes residential and office spaces now sits on the very spot where Great World Amusement Park used to stand.  Architecture and design  The developers saw fit to retain a similar concept of the \\"Worlds\\" and introduce it to the new development. Different themes like African, Spanish, Egyptians and Wild West were implemented inside the toilets accompanied with ornamentations all around the mall. Even the ceiling board is painted sky blue to portray the idea of visitors entering into a \\"World\\" of its own. The thematic approach was met with both sides of the critic, with the younger generation lauding the convenience brought by the mall while the older generation lamenting the lack of justice that these thematic facades do to the rich history that Great World Amusement Park bringsTong, Kelvin. 1997. \\"Once, the world was great\\".

She is an active member of S≈çka Gakkai. History =Early years= Nancy was born in Billinge Higher End, near Wigan, and learned piano and guitar at an early age, the latter being entirely self-taught. By the age of 18 she had made one EP, Basis, and one LP, Fly Alley, both of which were recorded, produced, manufactured and distributed by Nancy using home equipment. Around this time Cunliffe started to experiment with other instruments and acquired a khim from Thailand and a Celtic harp. Having initially started playing on the Wigan music scene, she attended Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and moved to playing regularly in Manchester, Liverpool and around England. =The Wheel Turning King= Nancy's first EP, released in 2006, was recorded in an old Corinthian-style church on the outskirts of Liverpool and is named after the concept of an ideal ruler in ancient Indian mythology. Recorded at night to reduce traffic noise interference, some distortion can be heard when listening carefully: in particular on the aptly named \\"Waiting for Cars\\". The record was released by Manchester-based Timbreland. =Battle and Victory= The first LP, Battle and Victory was released 24 September 2007 and licensed to The Leaf Label. This marked the first record where Cunliffe was dropped as a performing name. The album was critically well received and drew favourable comparisons with music by Joanna Newsom, Josephine Foster and many others. The release of this album went hand in hand with an increase in the number of live performances, and she started to tour both the UK, Europe and further afield with regularity. =Wrought Iron= The second album Wrought Iron was released on 5 October 2009, again with The Leaf Label. It received excellent reviews, prompting an article to be written by Laura Barton in The Guardian. Drawing inspiration from natural sounds of the Faroe Islands (her grandmother's birthplace), rural Spain and the Lake District, the album was recorded in a remote corner of North Wales. Described as a \\"sparse album, dusted with piano, breathy vocals and harmonies, and touches of acoustic guitar, horns and accordion\\" this work moves away from the multi-instrumental previous works to concentrate mainly on the piano, guitar and vocal arrangements. Track 4 of the album was released as a single with an accompanying video, shot in Portishead lido. =Dancing ‚Äì third album= Recorded by herself in her small flat in Manchester, her third album was released on 20 May 2013 and received a four star review in Time Out and MusicOMH. The entertainment section of BBC Online recommended it for an 'alternative mercury award' stating that \\"Her cascading, intricately-arranged songs transcend genre conventions ‚Äì swirling strings and breathy harmonies conjuring up everything from Ennio Morricone to PJ Harvey\\" =Collaborations= Cunliffe has collaborated for many live shows and records, including touring with Tunng, A Hawk and a Hacksaw and James Yorkston. More recently a UK tour with James Blackshaw and Hauschka saw her perform live pieces written specifically for the tour, which features a headline show in the main hall of the Barbican Centre. She has also worked with Susumu Yokota and is in production with Paul White =TEDxUniversityOfManchester= In this TEDx talk, Nancy tells us about her journey as an artist and how her creative process has developed, as well as performing some of her mesmerising music. Nancy has made a name for herself as a singer-songwriter with a difference. As well as writing captivating music, she uses everything she can get her hands on in the creative process: from guitars and pianos to Celtic harps, harmoniums and dulcimers.

It was found in Newark, New Jersey during the late-1960s and early-1970s. It is a form of ADMA (African Diaspora Martial Arts), a form of martial arts developed by the slaves brought to the Americas from places like the Congo, Nigeria, Angola, Ghana and Senegal. The people who were brought west as slaves were generally the losers of tribal wars and therefore were well versed in warfare and personal combat. ADMA are arts that are a western regional synthesis of the martial arts in those countries of West-Africa. All of them (Capoeira, Kalinda, Tire Machete, Juego del Garrote, Knocking-n-kicking and Damye-ladja to name a few.) are basically local variations on what one might call ‚ÄúCapoeira‚Äù and/or ‚ÄùCaribbean Stick Fighting‚Äù or at least follow the same general concepts. In the United States those concepts merged with Western Boxing and created a kind of ‚ÄúAfricanized‚Äù street boxing that utilized many of the hand positions and defenses one would use to protect oneself from kicks and/or sticks‚Ä¶, and like Caribbean stick fighting/Capoeira: rhythmic, dance like motion is encouraged. BCR, as practiced by inner-city youth/men in Newark N.J. and the surrounding areas during the 1960s and 1970s, was often trained in communal \\"cliques\\" of mostly Afro-Caribbean and African-American youths during daily ‚ÄúRock Parties‚Äù (hours long, round robin sparring sessions set to music.), impromptu Slap-Boxing matches and the playing of martial games. In this way Brick City Rock is in line with other forms of ADMA in that it is trained through a communal sport/game \\"play\\" structure set to music. BCR rejects kata and other forms of learned structure and instead prefers to have the objective of the game shape the technique's presence in the art. BCR is typified by its Ginga like footwork and movements that resembled improvised dance moves.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Pre-historic mining Sketch of Minong Mine location Stone hammers used by prehistoric miners Native Americans first began mining copper at the Minong Mine site 4500 years ago, using stone implements to extract the pure copper available at the site and cold-hammering the metal to form spear points and other implements. These prehistoric miners created pits, some as much as 30 feet deep, that can still be seen at the site. Some pits showed evidence of early engineering efforts, using boulders to support the walls of the pit and drains to remove water. There was evidence that these ancient miners utilized fire-setting, where rocks were split by heating them with fire and rapidly cooling them with water to extract the copper within. When re-discovered in the 19th century, the prehistoric excavations in the Minong Mine area were described as extending \\"in almost a continuous line for more than two miles, in most instances the pits being so close together as barely to permit their convenient working.\\" A number of ancient mining artifacts were collected from the Minong site; primarily smooth cobbles used as hammers which were, it was said \\"collected by the cartload.\\" In addition, a fragment of a wooden bowl about three feet across, a wooden shovel, and a rawhide string were also discovered at the site. The Minong Mine (1872-1885) Modern copper mining on Isle Royale was begun in the 1840s and 1850s, although not at the Minong Mine site. This activity ceased in 1855, and for a number of years there were no permanent inhabitants on the island. In 1871, a group of explorers working for the North American Mineral Land Company arrived on the island. In the fall of that year, the explorers found the old Native American pit mines west of McCargoe Cove. In 1872, a group of prospectors returned and staked out the Minong Mine. In late 1874, the Minong Mining Company was organized in Detroit to mine the copper deposits in the area. The name \\"Minong\\" was taken from an Ojibwa word for \\"island\\" in general and Isle Royale in particular. This company purchased land from the North American Mineral Land Company and commenced a mining operation in 1875. Most of the copper mining was still done in open pit mining, but two shafts, one over 300 feet, were also sunk at the mine. In 1875, more than 50 people were working at the Minong Mine and living in the nearby settlement of Cove, at the end of McCargoe Cove. Later, at the height of the Minong operation, some 150 miners were employed at the mine. A railroad ran between the mine proper and Cove, and the mining settlement had a post office, a dam, a stamp mill (built in 1876), a dock, and a blacksmith's shop. 5720 pound nugget from mine The mine produced some large nuggets of copper; the first, in 1874, was a 5720-pound nugget which was subsequently displayed on the courthouse lawn in Detroit and at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition. This copper mass showed evidence of being worked by prehistoric miners, \\"the surface of the mass had evidently been beaten up into projecting ridges... depressions, several inches deep, and the intervening elevations, with their fractured summits, covering every foot of the exposed superficies.\\" In 1878, a copper mass weighing six tons was discovered, and in 1879 two nuggets of 3317 and 4175 pounds were discovered. In 1879, the Minong Mining Company was reorganized to form the Minong Copper Company, with its headquarters also located in Detroit. The Minong Copper Company continued work until June 1883, when they suspended mining operations, due in part to the low price of copper. A few individuals continued mining operations for another two years or so, but by 1885 all activity had ceased. In the ten years between 1875 and 1885, Minong Mine produced 249 tons of copper. However, the amount of copper produced slowly dwindled, and the mine was abandoned in 1885. The site today The area around Minong Mine sports small prehistoric pits, as well as the larger pits (now filled with water) and shafts from the 1870s mine. Piles of tailings, the wreckage of a smithy, railroad tracks, and ore carts also are at the site. As of 1994, the dam near McCargoe Cove was still intact.

Both his paternal and maternal grandparents emigrated from Poland in the 1930s. He and his younger brother were raised by their divorced mother, who still lives in Buenos Aires. His childhood coincided with tough economic times, and the local Jewish community center was a refuge for his family. He grew up in a strong Jewish home and, with assistance from the local community, attended Jewish schools. \\"I knew the names of the streets of Haifa before I knew those of Buenos Aires.\\" At his bar mitzvah, he discovered that being Jewish involved a religion, as well as a culture, and entered a Conservative seminary of Masorti movement. His formation is well-rounded and includes seven years at a rabbinical seminary, though he was never ordained Rabbi. He received an MBA degree equivalent for Jewish education studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and studied Business Administration from the University of Buenos Aires.

While working at the JDC, a Jewish American NGO known for supporting Jewish communities around the world, in Paris, Spokoiny served as the JDC's Regional Director.Andres Spokoiny Bio He was on the frontline of the rebuilding of the Jewish communities in Poland, the Baltic states and parts of Russia after the fall of communism and also involved in other projects to develop communities internationally for Northeast Europe. Spokoiny has, concurrently, been Director of Leatid Europe, the leading training institute for Jewish lay and professional leaders in Europe. It was rewarding but not fun work for him. Rebuilding Jewish communities that had basically been wiped out by Nazism and communism was like taking revenge on history. It was fascinating, but daunting and emotionally heavy.

It was the seat of the Bishops of Cortona from 1507 to 1986, and is now a co-cathedral in the present Diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro. History The church was built over the remains of an ancient Roman temple and is mentioned (as a pieve, or plebeian church) in the 11th century. In 1325 the diocese of Cortona was created from the territory of the diocese of Arezzo, but the present cathedral was not chosen at that date as the episcopal seat, although the adjoining building was used as the bishop's residence. In 1507 Pope Julius II resolved the anomaly and transferred the bishop's seat from the sub-urban church of San Vincenzo. As if in preparation for its new importance, the interior had been refurbished in the late 15th century. Description The appearance of the original medieval church is mostly hidden by later additions, such as the 18th century barrel vaulted ceiling in the nave, which was repainted in the late 19th century by the local artist Giovanni Brunacci; in the same period the oval windows, the triumphal arch and the pavement were also added or remade. The oldest elements visible are in the Romanesque fa√ßade - a pier with capital, and small columns at the corners, and part of the large arcade. The church has a central nave and two aisles, divided by columns with Brunelleschi-inspired capitals. The south side has a loggia built in the late 16th century. The bell tower dates from the middle of the same century. Artworks in the interior include an Adoration of the Shepherds by Pietro da Cortona and assistants (c. 1663), a Consecration of the Church of the Holy Saviour by Andrea Commodi (1607, brought here in the late 18th century) and a Descent of the Holy Spirit by Tommaso Bernabei (1528-1529). The town's Diocesan Museum houses works formerly in the cathedral, including Pietro Lorenzetti's Maest√† (before 1320), and a tapestry and a reliquary from the period of the Renaissance.

Life The grave of Very Rev John Adamson, St Andrews Cathedral graveyard He was the son of Lawrence Adamson, Schoolmaster of Leuchars. He was educated in St Andrews University where he received the degree of M.A. in 1757. He was licensed to preach the gospel by the Presbytery of St Andrews on 2 March 1753, but it was not until 1764 that he was ordained as Minister of Kilmany. Eight years later, in 1772 he transferred to the more lucrative post as Minister of the Second Charge of St Andrews. He also became Professor of Civil History in the United College in the University there. He was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity by his University in 1777. Two years later, in 1779 he transferred to the even more lucrative First Charge of St Andrews. He was technically presented to this charge by King George III, but in fact by Henry Dundas, who exercised the royal patronage in Scotland. He was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on 18 May 1797. This was during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Government in Britain feared political agitation, so the General Assembly was anxious to demonstrate its loyalty and devotion. It voted an address to the King, signed by John Adamson, Moderator, which they assured him that > They continue to feel and to act as becomes Britons, ready to sacrifice > every private consideration in behalf of their beloved Sovereign, of the > independence of their country, and of their religion and liberties.While our > people patiently and cheerfully endure the inevitable toils and burdens of a > war, they join with us in cherishing the pleasing hope of peace, when peace > can be obtained on terms fair and honourable, such as will give full > security for the many blessings by which your Majesty's subjects are > distinguished. For the attainment of which most desirable object, we rely, > under God, with the most entire confidence on the wisdom and vigour of your > Majesty's councils. He died of \\"an apoplexy\\" after preaching on 21 August 1808. His table form grave lies close to St Rule's Tower in the graveyard of St Andrews Cathedral. Family On 4 July 1765 he married Sophie Kay, daughter of Thomas Kay, Minister of Kilmany, and had a large family.

It was part of the seigneurie (manor) of Chasteaux-en-Anjou, the future Ch√¢teau-la-Valli√®re. Ruined walls of Vaujours Castle  Location  The castle is located 3 kilometres south of Ch√¢teau-la- Valli√®re. It stands on the eastern border of the ancient Haut-Anjou, part of the former province of Anjou.  History  Arms of Ch√¢teau-la-Valli√®re Duchess of La Valli√®re and Vaujours The fiefdom of Vaujours was a dependency of the s√©n√©chauss√©e (bailiwick) of Baug√© and the diocese of Angers. Hugues I d'Alluye, living in 978, is the earliest known lord. The castle of the barons of Chasteaux was built to defend the territory of Anjou. Construction of the castle can be attributed to Hugues VI d'Alluye or to Rotron of Montfort, around 1250.Ministry of Culture M√©rim√©e database Ruines du ch√¢teau de Vaujours During the Hundred Years War, the fortress was never taken by the English. A major restoration was undertaken in the 15th century. Jean V de Bueil, nicknamed ¬´le Fl√©au des Anglais¬ª (the flail of the English), altered the defences such that they became impregnable. He died there in 1477. Louis XI stayed there during his visits to Anjou. The daughter of Charles VII and Agn√®s Sorel, Jeanne de Valois, married Antoine de Bueil, son of Jean V de Bueil. Under the Ancien R√©gime, the castle was bought by Louis XIV in 1666 and given in 1667 to his former mistress, Mademoiselle Louise de la Valli√®re; she became Duchesse de La Valli√®re et de Vaujours. In the 18th century, Louise de la Valli√®re bequeathed it to the Davot family, who occupied the castle for a long period. The castle was abandoned during the French Revolution. In 1815, it was sold to Thomas Stanhope-Holland, who used it as a quarry. The site was added to the list of monuments historiques on 24 October 1944, and the ruins were classified on 26 January 1989. The site and castle are private property but offer guided-tours to the public.  Architecture  The castle ruins stand in the valley of the Fare, south of Ch√¢teau-la-Valli√®re, close to the hamlet of Vaujours. The castle, of typical military architecture, stands on a mound in the middle of a lake whose waters feed the moats which surround it. It is formed of two fortresses: a bailey to the west and the castle to the east. The entry to the double enceinte is defended by two cylindrical towers and a flying bridge, flanked to the north by a bastion. A drawbridge and a posternflanked by a cylindrical tower to the north provide access to the courtyard. The residence is to the south, the ruins of the chapel to the north. To the east, the towers give access to a covered chemin de ronde and to the south the bastion connected to the fortress and a further building. Inside the fortress the keep still exists, as does the lower courtyard. The enceinte includes several towers, some of which have rustication. The moats are drained and overgrown. The ruins have been cleared of vegetation and are surrounded by lawns and hedges.

Life Born into a Neapolitan noble family of Spanish origin, he was made lieutenant of the Order on the death of Grand Master Giovanni Battista Tommasi in 1805, since the Order had been expelled from its traditional base on Malta and was now based in Catania. Guevara-Suardo distinguished himself as an admiral of the Order's naval fleet, using all his authority and firmness to prevent the Order's lands in Sicily being sold, as was planned during the reign of Joachim Murat, the new king of Sicily. On 23 June 1811 he also had to accept the suppression of the Order of Saint John of the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, operated by Frederick William III of Prussia, who founded a new order with a view to nominating the new Grand Master, so as to completely remove the ancient Brandenburg institution from the Catholic Order of Malta. During his lieutenancy he also worked hard to get the British government to return complete control of Malta to the Order, which they were unwilling to do even after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. With a political and diplomatic commitment, in the same years in which the Order and Britain faced off against each other, Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden offered to transfer the Order's base to the island of Gotland, so as to have the prestigious order based on Swedish soil. Guevara-Suardo was grateful for the offer but refused it right as soon as it was made, since accepting it would look to the British as if the Order was giving up its legitimate and secular claims on Malta. On his death in 1814 Guevara-Suardo was buried in the convent church of Novaluce and succeeded as lieutenant by Andrea Di Giovanni y Centell√©s.

Hanan Alattar takes the lead at ENO . May 11, 2010  Early life and education Alattar was born in Houston, Texas. She first became interested in opera while a student at Saint Agnes Academy in her native city. She studied vocal performance at the University of Texas at Austin and with Marlena Malas and Diane Richardson at the Juilliard School in New York City. While at Juilliard she portrayed roles in several productions, including Tatyana in Eugene Onegin, Lady Billows in Britten's Albert Herring, and the title role in Igor Stravinsky's The Nightingale (2004). In The New York Times review of the latter performance, Allan Kozinn wrote that \\"[Alattar] sang the Nightingale's music with beauty, suppleness and the right measure of flighty virtuosity.\\" Alattar was the New Horizon Scholar at the Aspen Music Festival from 2000‚Äì2002, and was notably the winner of the Aspen Concerto Competition in 2002. While at Aspen she performed the roles of Blanche in Edward Berkeley's production of Poulenc's Les dialogues des Carm√©lites under the baton of James Conlon, sang Giorgetta in Puccini's Il tabarro with conductor Julius Rudel, and performed the title role in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. In 2002‚Äì2003 she was a member of the Young Artist Program at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis. She was a finalist in Houston Grand Opera's Eleanor McCollum Competition and in 2004 received the Sullivan Foundation Award.  Career  Alattar made her professional opera debut in 2004 with the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis (OTSL) as Sacagawea in the world premiere of Stephen Mager's Dream of the Pacific. Later that year she made her debut with the New York City Opera (NYCO) as the First Maid in Richard Strauss' Daphne. She has since returned to the NYCO as The Water in Rachel Portman's The Little Prince (2005) and as Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni (2006). In 2005 Alattar made her debut with the Gotham Chamber Opera (GCO) in New York City as Alceste in Handel's Arianna in Creta. That same year she performed the role of the Beggar Woman in Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd with the Wolf Trap Opera Company and Bubikopf in Viktor Ullmann's Der Kaiser von Atlantis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival. In 2006 she made her debut with the Los Angeles Opera as Amore in L'incoronazione di Poppea and returned to the LAO later that year to create the role of Dragonette in the world premiere of Elliot Goldenthal‚Äôs Grendel and portray the Celestial Voice in Don Carlo. In 2007 she portrayed Ghita in Alexander von Zemlinsky's Der Zwerg with the American Symphony Orchestra at the Bard Music Festival. In 2008 Alattar returned to the Ravinia Festival in Chicago to portray Konstanze in Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail and made her debut with Palm Beach Opera as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto. In 2009 she returned to the OTSL to portray Rosina in John Corigliano‚Äôs The Ghosts of Versailles and made her debut with the Boston Lyric Opera as Mica√´la in Carmen. In 2010 she performed the role of Clarice in the GCO's production of Haydn's Il mondo della luna at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. In 2011 she made her debut with the Seattle Opera as Pamina in The Magic Flute. In 2007 Alattar made her European debut as Pousette in Massenet's Manon at the Berlin State Opera under conductor Daniel Barenboim. In 2009 she made her UK debut as Musetta in Jonathan Miller's production of La boh√®me at the English National Opera. She returned to the ENO in 2010 to play the lead role, Leila, in Georges Bizet's early opera The Pearl Fishers, in an updated production directed by British film-maker Penny Woolcock.

Local search methods can get stuck in a local minimum, where no improving neighbors are available. A simple modification consists of iterating calls to the local search routine, each time starting from a different initial configuration. This is called repeated local search, and implies that the knowledge obtained during the previous local search phases is not used. Learning implies that the previous history, for example the memory about the previously found local minima, is mined to produce better and better starting points for local search. The implicit assumption is that of a clustered distribution of local minima: when minimizing a function, determining good local minima is easier when starting from a local minimum with a low value than when starting from a random point. The only caveat is to avoid confinement in a given attraction basin, so that the kick to transform a local minimizer into the starting point for the next run has to be appropriately strong, but not too strong to avoid reverting to memory-less random restarts. Iterated Local Search is based on building a sequence of locally optimal solutions by: # perturbing the current local minimum; # applying local search after starting from the modified solution. The perturbation strength has to be sufficient to lead the trajectory to a different attraction basin leading to a different local optimum. Perturbation Algorithm The perturbation algorithm for ILS is not an easy task. The main aim is not to get stuck into the same local minimum and in order to get this property true, the undo operation is forbidden. Despite this, a good permutation has to consider a lot of values, since there exist two kind of bad permutations: # too weak: fall back to the same local minimum # too strong: random restart =Benchmark Perturbation= The procedure consists in fix a number of values for the perturbation such that these values are significant for the instance: on average probability and not rare. After that, on runtime it will be possible to check the benchmark plot in order to get an average idea on the instances passed. =Adaptive Perturbation= Since there is no function a priori that tells which one is the most suitable value for our perturbation, the best criteria is to get it adaptive. For instance Battiti and Protasi proposed a reactive search algorithm for MAX-SAT which fits perfectly into the ILS. framework. They perform a ‚Äúdirected‚Äù perturbation scheme which is implemented by a tabu search algorithm and after each perturbation they apply a standard local descent algorithm. Another way of adapting the perturbation is to change deterministically its strength during the search. =Optimizing Perturbation= Another procedure is to optimize a sub-part of the problem, having that keeps active the not-undo property. If this procedure is possible, all solutions generated after the perturbations tend to be very good. Furthermore the new parts are optimized too. Conclusions The method has been applied to several Combinatorial Optimization Problems including the Job-Shop Scheduling Problems, Flow-Shop Problems, Vehicle Routing Problems as well as many others.

It is less ideologically driven, than green urbanism or sustainable urbanism. In many ways, ecological urbanism is an evolution of, and a critique of, Landscape Urbanism arguing for a more holistic approach to the design and management of cities. The term appeared first in 1998 as \\"EcoUrbanism\\" in a book by Architect and Planner Miguel Ruano,Eco-Urbanism: Sustainable Human Settlements, 60 Case Studies ‚Äì Gustavo Gili, 1998 - 192 pages  http://www.abebooks.com/9788425217234/Eco- Urbanism-Sustainable-Human-Settlements-Case-8425217237/plp who defined it as \\"the development of multi-dimensional sustainable human communities within harmonious and balanced built environments\\". The term was used later in April 2003 at a conference at the University of Oregon, and again in 2006 in a paper by Jeffrey Hou. The phrase was used by Mohsen Mostafavi in 2007 in Intervention Architecture and in a lecture at the Canadian Centre for Architecture, ecological urbanism as a project was largely started at Harvard University Graduate School of Design, with a conference, and exhibition, and book. Arguing for a \\"new ethics and aesthetics of the urban,\\" the 656-page Ecological Urbanism book, edited by Mohsen Mostafavi with Gareth Doherty, was published in May 2010 by Lars M√ºller Publishers (). The book follows the conference, and exhibition, held at the GSD in 2009. The book has a long list of contributors, including Rem Koolhaas, Homi K. Bhabha, Mitchell Joachim, Andrea Branzi, and about 130 others. A blog during the conference is part of the book. According to Architecture Today, the book is \\"one of the few books that recognises and articulates how, if this systems-based approach is to be successful, it needs to design, integrate and express complex systems and social processes in ways that are fundamentally humane.\\" The book has been reviewed and cited in many publications, including [Metropolis Magazine], The Journal of Landscape Architecture, and Cities magazine. Events and discussions on the book have been held at the 2010 Venice Biennale, the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York, and at the Van Alen Institute in New York. In his introduction to the Ecological Urbanism, \\"Why Ecological Urbanism? Why Now?\\", extracted in Topos: The International Review of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design, Mostafavi asks: \\"Increased numbers of people and cities go hand in hand with a greater exploitation of the world‚Äôs limited resources. Every year, more cities are feeling the devastating impacts of this situation. What are we to do? What means do we have as designers to address this challenging reality? Jeb Brugmann in his book Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities Are Changing the World (Bloomsbury Press, 2009) says we need to become \\"masters of a stable, just, and ecological urbanism.\\" For Brugmann, \\"The first step towards ecological urbanism is increasing the energy and nutrient productivity within the city, but the only way to move sufficiently from extractive mode to a sustainable productive mode is to think, design, and develop at the scale of the City.\\" There have been a number of recent conferences and lectures on the project of ecological urbanism, including: The New Aesthetics and Ecological Urbanism at Peking University in October 2010, New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism: A Prospectus for the Super City, in October 2010. The University of Washington‚Äôs urban initiative included a seminar on Now Urbanism and talks \\"on Ecological Urbanism, Ecological Design for Healthy Cities, Networked Urbanism, and America‚Äôs War on Immigrants\\". Eco-Urbanism: towards sustainable city living, was hosted by Nottingham University at the Shanghai Expo in August 2010.http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/.../eco-urbanismprogramme.doc In addition to courses at the GSD in 2008 and 2011, there have been courses on ecological urbanism at the Bergen School of Architecture, Oslo School of Architecture and Design, and Yale University. It is on numerous course syllabi, including Advanced Design Theories 2010 at Florida International University. Arizona State University expanded on the subject with a lecture by Charles Anderson, ASLA.Charles Morris Anderson Anderson stated that \\"ecology is concerned with the relationships between all organisms and the environment. Together and coupled with aesthetic and expressionist design principles, they form the foundation for urban design.\\" Mohsen Mostafavi, Gareth Doherty, Marina Correia, Ana Maria Duran Calisto, Giannina Braschi, and Luis Valenzuela produced a Latin American Ecological Urbanism project, resulting in the 2019 Spanish and Portuguese book \\"Urbanismo ecol√≥gico en Am√©rica Latina\\". Criticism of ecological urbanism Ecological urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis. Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end. Ecological Urbanism is explained as a successor to Landscape Urbanism without the difference between the two approaches, and the terms used in the new approach, being defined. Jason King sees it as an inadequately explained addition to a list of 61 other 'Fill-in-the-blank Urbanisms'. Tom Turner welcomes landscape and ecological urbanism as 'the most significant contributions to landscape design theory since the landscape architecture profession was launched in the mid-nineteenth century' but is 'unpersuaded by the change of name'http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/2014/01/02/landscape- ecological-urbanism/ References Environmental planning Ecology Design Landscape architecture Sustainable urban planning ","title":"Ecological urbanism"},{"id":"30155661","text":"The murder of Michael McGurk was an Australian contract killing. McGurk, a Scottish-born Australian businessman, was murdered by a single gunshot to his head on 3 September 2009 outside his , Sydney family home. In October 2010 five men were arrested and several charges laid; and by April 2013 four of them had been convicted and jailed in connection with the murder of McGurk. The last accused, businessman Ronald Edward \\"Ron\\" Medich, was, in April 2018, found guilty by a jury in the Supreme Court of orchestrating the murder of McGurk, and of intimidating McGurk's wife. In June 2018 Medich was sentenced to a 39-years custodial sentence.  Michael McGurk  McGurk, born Mick Rushford in 1958 in Glasgow, Scotland, was raised in the Gorbals notorious slum area by his grandmother and brothers; although some media reports claim that Rushford was raised in Edinburgh. Rushford travelled to Australia in 1993, where he began working with ECC Lighting, in inner Sydney. Whilst he was employed at ECC, Customs officers found out that Rushford had overstayed his temporary visa. Served with a deportation notice, Rushford left Australia, travelling to New Zealand, via Fiji, and returned with a new passport and new identity as Michael Loch McGurk, altering his birth date from 1958 to 1964. McGurk rose far above his impoverished roots, living in a $4 million home, driving a Mercedes S-Class, and taking luxury ski holidays. Described by some media agencies as an alcoholic and a heavy cocaine user, McGurk was variously reported as the director of 28 failed or deregistered companies; a standover man, fixer and debt collector; a lender of last resort; negotiator; and a property developer. Media reports claim that McGurk was involved in supplying prostitutes to high-profile people, including leading sports figures and, in the last weeks of his life, was negotiating a property deal with associates of nightclub identity John Ibrahim. = Business links with Ron Medich = His main trading vehicle, Bentley Smythe and associated companies, Bentley Smythe Financial Services, Bentley Smythe Mortgage Fund No 1, and Bentley Smythe Mortgage Fund No 2, were all reportedly solvent at the time of his death. Eagle Street Finance, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brisbane-based H&G; Corporate, had a registered mortgage over the assets of Bentley Smythe Mortgage Fund No 1. His sometime business partner and BRW Rich 200 member, Ron Medich had an interest in one of McGurk's companies, Business Investment Opportunities. Of the ten million shares in this company (issued at $1 each), Ron Medich Properties owned 380,000 of the shares, with the remainder owned by Celtic Sydney, a company wholly owned and controlled by McGurk. Other media reports claimed that McGurk died owing millions. McGurk was reportedly two months in arrears on the $2.4 million mortgage on his Cremorne house to the mortgagee, BankWest. In investigating the details provided at time of approving the loan, BankWest found that the information supplied by McGurk was allegedly fraudulent. The tax files and pay slips McGurk had provided to obtain the loan had been forged. Title to the house was in the name of McGurk's wife. Following revelations of the fraud, BankWest advised McGurk that, as mortgagee, it intended to sell the property. McGurk sought assistance from Medich who reportedly lent him $3.6 million to pay out BankWest. McGurk also owed Medich $10 million at the time of his death, relating to Medich's equity in Business Investment Opportunities. In an interesting twist of fate, Medich, together with Graham Richardson, a political lobbyist and former Labor federal minister, met Sam Haddad, the Director-General of NSW Planning, the day before the alleged murder of McGurk and reportedly discussed why Haddad overrode senior planning officials' recommendation that the Medich land be rezoned after a meeting with Frank Sartor, at the time the Labor NSW Minister for Planning. Reports of the financial relationship between Medich and Richardson varied, with McGurk alleging to Herald journalists that Richardson was on a retainer of $25,000 per month, whereas Medich claimed that Richardson was being paid $5,000 per month.  Civil dispute between Medich and McGurk  In various media reports, it was claimed that Medich and McGurk were in dispute, including matters that were brought before the Federal Court by Medich against McGurk and his wife, and various companies associated with McGurk. These matters were heard by the Court and dismissed on 8 April 2009, due to Medich failing to disclose material facts.. Costs were awarded against Medich. In another matter that is yet to be resolved, Medich and McGurks' executors are in dispute.. = Other business links = Prior to his death, McGurk was negotiating a property deal for Bob Ell, a BRW Rich 200 billionaire. Ell's company, Leda Holdings, had interest in Kings Cross landmark property, the Crest Hotel. Ell sought to redevelop the Crest and buy the property from Australand for $70 million. According to media reports, McGurk was negotiating on behalf of Ell and for business associates of John Ibrahim to run the downstairs bar area of the Crest in return for an investment of $10‚Äì$15 million. McGurk was working with Ell to collect rent from tenants and met disgraced former company director, Jim Byrnes. Despite initially being on opposing sides of negotiations, Byrne and McGurk would later form a friendship, and work together for Ell. Leda Holdings held a $450,000 mortgage over McGurk's city office on York Street, Sydney ‚Äì which is owned by McGurk's wife. It was reported that Australand rejected the McGurk's proposal just days before his death. McGurk's company, Bentley Smythe, had previously lent up to $1 million to businessman Richard Woods. Woods was the owner of a bathhouse which was beset by leaking water problems, located on the first floor of the Crest Hotel building. Theo Baker, a Sydney telecommunications and financial software millionaire and another BRW Rich 200 member, provided McGurk with a $300,000 loan to retain his black Mercedes S-class, following repossession of the vehicle by a finance company. Baker's loan was also secured by a mortgage against a city property owned by McGurk's wife. HSBC Australia held a second mortgage over the Cremorne family home. It was reported that HSBC Australia, as mortgagee in possession, placed a property owned by McGurk, located in Orlando Avenue, Cremorne, up for mortagee sale. At various times McGurk's business associates included Mark Burby, a Jersey businessman, who together with McGurk were allegedly planning to blackmail the Sultan of Brunei following an earlier unsuccessful attempt to sue the Sultan for reneging on a deal to buy a 400-year-old miniature Koran. According to Burby, the blackmail related to \\"...an ongoing private matter involving one of the Sultan's relatives\\". = Closed or failed companies = The closed and failed companies associated with McGurk and financial position (where known) included: *Tandew ‚Äì The Federal Court ordered liquidation of the company in February 2007 following an application by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. Debts of $1.95 million were outstanding *Australian Residential Land Company ‚Äì application for voluntary deregistration lodged on 24 July 2009 by the directors, McGurk and Medich. The sole shareholder of this company is a company whose directors include Neville Wran, a former Labor Premier *Acett ‚Äì Ron Medich Properties (a company controlled by Medich) made application on 15 April 2009 for Acett to be wound up; and later withdrew the application *The Australian Hotel Group ‚Äì liquidators were appointed in September 2005. McGurk was not a director of this company at this point in time; serving as a director between 2001 and 2004. It was reported that in April 2008, the company has debts of $4.4 million to 24 creditors *Chilfunky *Amswell *MMG Investments *ATC Growth *Re-Educate *Thermoelectric International *Sports Management International *Australian Telecommunications Consortium *Grand Prix Swimming = Connections with the Labor Party = McGurk had also been lobbying on the sale of Currawong, a Pittwater site owned by Unions NSW. Moses Obeid, the son of former Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid, helped McGurk negotiate with John Robertson, then Secretary of Unions NSW. Following McGurk's death, Robertson stated that McGurk was representing Medich and that while their $30 million bid for Currawong was the highest, it was conditional on development approval. Unions NSW accepted a bid for a lesser amount, because there were no conditions attached. Richard Vereker, an associate of McGurk and aged 68 at the time of McGurk's death, was mentioned in a 2008 ICAC inquiry involving Wollongong City Council. At this Inquiry, ICAC found that eleven individuals engaged in various forms of corrupt conduct between 2004 and 2007. Vereker, a former butcher, bookmaker, and Wollongong businessman, had reportedly facilitated a meeting between McGurk and Graham Richardson that later led to McGurk attempting to exhort Medich. Vereker, a disability pensioner, was reportedly NSW Labor's second largest individual donor, with a political donation of $75,000 in the 2007 state election campaign. On 1 July 2010, Vereker, with Mark Abernethy, published a biography of McGurk, called The Fast Life and Sudden Death of Michael McGurk. The Sydney Morning Herald also revealed links with Craig Knowles, a former NSW Planning Minister, and with Lucas Neill, a captain of the Socceroos, in McGurk's alleged role as a financial middleman for the set-up of a proposed western Sydney A-League soccer team. The registered office of Sydney Wanderers Football Club, the legal entity of the new club, was the offices of Bentley Smythe in York Street, Sydney ‚Äì McGurk's place of business. The proposal to set up the new soccer club collapsed on 2 September 2009, the day before McGurk's murder. It was later revealed that McGurk was acting on behalf of Paddy Dominguez, Neil's manager and Bob Ell, a potential sponsor of the soccer club.  Criminal investigations against McGurk  In early 2009, McGurk had been charged with assault and two charges of firebombing houses, one of which was that of Adam Tilley, allegedly firebombing the Point Piper home in November 2008. Tilley purchased the Wolseley Road mansion from Medich for $12.5 million in 2004. Central to the dispute between Tilley, Medich, and McGurk was an agreement for Tilley and Medich to develop land adjoining the Wolseley Road property that could potentially yield Medich $20 million (net). As the global financial crisis resulted in a dip in property market values, Medich assigned his $10 million interest in the Point Piper property to McGurk. McGurk allegedly demanded Tilley repay the maximum $20 million. McGurk commenced action in the Supreme Court when his demands were refused. Two weeks prior to his murder, the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions dropped the charges, including the alleged firebombing of another property in Queen Street, Beaconsfield, owned by the valuer Stuart Rowan. McGurk had also been charged in connection with an assault on Rowan after Rowan refused to provide McGurk with a valuation on a Bathurst property. Other charges that were dropped related to the alleged assault on a former employee, Will Manning with a cricket bat and further counts of arson relating to the firebombing of a former business associate's Cremorne property. Media reports claim that McGurk was involved in the alleged firebombing of a Balmoral house, owned by Justin Brown (of CB Richard Ellis); although Brown never pressed charges against McGurk. Brown was also assaulted in his office ‚Äì allegedly on McGurk's instructions. = Other criminal allegations against McGurk = Following McGurk's death, an unnamed criminal, aged 73, prosecuted for fraud and in custody at the time of McGurk's death, alleges that he was kidnapped and tortured by associates of McGurk because he was trying to leave a gang that was undertaking systemic and organised superannuation fraud. Apparently police were aware of the alleged fraud scheme (operating between 2003 and 2005) and grossed in excess of $2 million for McGurk; but were unable to obtain a clear link to prove McGurk was involved, despite the man making the allegations was living in a property owned by McGurk.  Murder  McGurk was killed by a single gunshot to his head some time between 6:30 pm and 6:45 pm on 3 September 2009 outside his family home in Cranbrook Avenue, Cremorne. McGurk lived in the house with his wife, Kimberley, and their four children and were reportedly \\"...a Catholic family, a lovely family.\\" According to friends and McGurk's priest, he was a generous man and doting father. McGurk's nine-year-old son, Luc, was with him at the time of the shooting and is reported to have been a witness to the murder. Emergency services were called to the murder scene and rendered assistance to McGurk; however he could not be saved and died at the scene of the shooting. = Funeral = McGurk's life was celebrated at a public funeral held in at Mosman's Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where more than 300 people were in attendance. His children recalled a loving, benevolent family man and soccer coach. McGurk's youngest daughter Nicola, aged 11, was reported as saying: :\\"You are the best dad in the whole wide world and I love and still love you more than anything.\\" A letter written by Luc for Father's Day was read to the congregation: :\\"I remember when we went to my first soccer gala day and you were the one on the sideline cheering me on,\\" he wrote. His other son, Lochlan wrote: :\\"Thanks, dad, for all the time we have had together. I will miss you.\\" McGurk's eldest daughter Mia, aged 12, was reported as saying to the congregation: :\\"He always gave to the poor and wouldn't expect anything in return. He was a great businessman. If Dad ever saw anything that needed to be fixed, he'd fix it straightaway.\\" McGurk's father, Bob, and his brothers, Edward and Bobby, travelled from Scotland to attend the funeral. = Tape revelations = Within days of McGurk's death, it was revealed that McGurk had a tape recording of a conversation with Medich, which McGurk was allegedly using to try to extort money from Medich. It was alleged that Medich was attempting to influence government officials by improper means. It was reported that Medich sought planning approval to rezone land that he owned at Badgerys Creek on the south-western fringes of Sydney. There was immense and, what some described as, sensational, media coverage about these tapes, their content, and possible ramifications. On 5 September 2009 The Sydney Morning Herald published on its front-page, \\"Exclusive: Secret tape blamed for killing\\". Directly below the banner: \\"It could bring down the Government.\\" The following day Graham Richardson, a former Hawke and Keating Labor federal government minister and now political lobbyist, told Channel Nine that he had heard the tape and the key part which apparently exposes the Labor figures is inaudible. Richardson stated that McGurk was allegedly trying to blackmail Medich for $8 million and that in about June 2009 Richardson had provided a formal statement to NSW Police. Commenting on Richardson's very public denial of the tapes containing any matter of substance, Jennifer Hewett, national affairs columnist with The Australian, wrote: :The very notion that Richardson ‚Äì a man normally desperate to avoid contributing to his media profile these days ‚Äì is so determined to publicly dismiss the significance of the tape should set off plenty of alarms. On 8 September 2009, NSW Police passed a copy of this tape to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). However, the NSW Opposition called for a Parliamentary Inquiry. On 9 September 2009, a motion was carried in the Legislative Council to establish an inquiry into Badgerys Creek land dealings and planning decisions. The inquiry's Terms of Reference included inquiring into and \\"report on land dealings and planning decisions relating to land or interests in land held solely or jointly by Ron Medich Properties Pty Ltd and Roy Medich Properties Pty Ltd in or around Badgerys Creek\\", with a particular focus on roles of the Minister for Planning, other Ministers, NSW Planning, other government agencies, members of parliament, political parties and lobbyists, and to make recommendations about planning integrity. Fourteen submissions were received, including submissions from Richardson, NSW Planning (via Sam Haddad), the Property Council of Australia, and Penrith City Council. Public hearings were held on: *29 September 2009 ‚Äì appearing were Haddad and other NSW Planning officials, Kristina Keneally in her capacity as Minister for Planning, and both Roy and Ron Medich; *19 October 2009 ‚Äì appearing were Frank Sartor, in his capacity as a former Minister for Planning, Richardson, and Haddad and other NSW Planning officials; and *14 December 2009 ‚Äì Richardson again appeared. An interim report was tabled to Parliament on 20 November 2009, and made eleven recommendations with a focus on stronger regulation of contact between planning officials, development proponents and lobbyists. The Committee also recommended tighter regulation of political donations. The second supplementary report was tabled on 25 February 2010 and only became necessary as a result of Richardson's unwillingness to respond in writing to questions submitted after his evidence at the Committee's first hearing. Meanwhile, based on information in the recording plus media reports and information provided by an inmate in a correction centre, ICAC identified thirteen matters for investigation. A public enquiry was held over five days, and commenced on 1 February 2010. Medich, Haddad, and Richardson all gave evidence at the ICAC Inquiry. The Commissioner determined that there were no findings of corrupt conduct; and was unable to substantiate any of the thirteen allegations. = Arrests = On 13 October 2010, thirteen months after the murder of McGurk, homicide detectives arrested the following: *Fortunato \\"Lucky\\" Gattellari (60), a former Australian featherweight boxing champion and brother of Rocky Gattellari ‚Äì charged with soliciting the murder of McGurk and being an accessory after the fact *Senad Kaminic (42), a former Bosnian soldier and business associate of Gattellari ‚Äì charged with being an accessory before and after the fact *Haissam Safetli (45) ‚Äì charged with murder of McGurk *Christopher Estephan (20) ‚Äì charged with murder of McGurk It was reported that four days after the murder of McGurk, police seized a number of weapons from Gattellari's home. Media reports claim that Gattellari was appointed a director to a number of companies associated with Medich in July 2009. Court documents lodged by police, allege that some time after 1 May 2009, Gattellari solicited Safetli to murder McGurk and that for more than thirteen months after the killing \\"did receive, harbour, maintain, and assist\\" Safetli. Medich, who has reportedly known Gattellari from childhood, had lent millions to Gattellari, including $4.8 million between November 2009 and October 2010 and $16 million in total, through various joint ventures. On 27 October 2010 police also arrested McGurk's business associate Ronald Edward \\"Ron\\" Medich, and charged him with soliciting to murder McGurk. Police alleged that Medich was the mastermind of the murder plot. Police arrested Medich at his solicitor's office and it was reported that Gattellari agreed to give evidence against Medich in defence of his own conspiracy charges. It was also reported that Safetli was prepared to give evidence against Medich. Despite Medich offering to put up $1 million in surety and his younger brother Roy Medich offering $500,000 in cash, bail was refused. A few days later, Medich was charged with murder of McGurk. Much media attention was made of Medich's fall from grace, as he spent a little under two months in solitary confinement whilst in custody, before being released on conditional bail. In a 2013 committal hearing, Medich pleaded not guilty to the murder of McGurk, and pleaded not guilty to a charge of intimidation in relation to McGurk's wife. A trial date of August 2014 was set, before Justice Megan Latham. = Convictions = In April 2013, 'Lucky' Gattellari was sentenced by Justice Megan Latham at the NSW Supreme Court to a maximum of 10 years. He was eligible for parole on 13 April 2018 and, after the NSW Parole Board refused parole, Gattellari lodged an appeal against the decision. Gattellari is facing further charges, together with Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara, for allegedly attempting to extort Medich. Kaminic was sentenced to a minimum 2¬Ω years in jail and a maximum of 4¬Ω and was eligible for parole in November 2017. In April 2013 Estephan was sentenced by Justice Geoffrey Bellew to a maximum of 6 years and 5 months' jail, with a minimum non-parole period of 5 years. He was eligible for parole on 12 October 2015. In August 2013 Haissam Safetli was sentenced to 6¬Ω years' jail for the murder of McGurk, and another six months for intimidating his widow. After a jury failed to reach a verdict in a 2017 trial, Medich was again tried before a Supreme Court jury and, on 23 April 2018, was found guilty of ordering the murder of McGurk, and of intimidating McGurk's wife. Medich had earlier plead not guilty to both charges. On 21 June 2018 in the Supreme Court, Medich was sentenced to a custodial sentence of 39 years; with a minimum non-parole period of 30 years.

The Proposal of rules and processes for registering the Cyrillic domain ‚Äú‚Äù is available on the forum of RNIDS. It regulates the registration of the sub-domain ‚Äú‚Äù and the reservation of other domains for the needs of RNIDS, the reservation of the ‚Äú‚Äù domain for the needs of the state, the reservation of the ‚Äú‚Äù domain based on the current .rs domain names and the allocation of the unique code to each and every reserved ‚Äú‚Äù domain. The Rule book also determines the period for assigning the \\"\\" domain according to the priority right, after which the period of free registration of the \\"\\" domain will commence, based on the same or similar rules now applicable for the .rs domain. The process of registering the Cyrillic domain \\"\\" had been expected to commence in the second half of 2011, but is postponed and it was started on 27 January 2012, due to some technical issues considering the documentation. \\"\\" has, in many fonts, a very similar appearance to the Latin alphanumeric .cp6, which is not registered as a TLD. Similarly proposed TLDs .–±–≥ (for Bulgaria) and .ŒµŒª (for the Greece) have been rejected or stalled because of this problem, but \\"\\" has not. The general policy for internationalized TLDs is to require at least one of the letters in a TLD to not resemble a Latin letter; 6 is a numeric digit (not a Latin letter) and is not used in any TLDs. Furthermore, though –± appears similar to a 6 in most Cyrillic alphabets, it does not in Serbian, where it more closely resembles Greek lowercase delta (Œ¥), see the relevant section in the article on the letter .  Advantage  \\"\\" domain has one specific advantage ‚Äì it is one of two domains in Europe (both operated by Serbian Domain Authority - RNIDS) that allows website addresses to be written exactly the way they are pronounced (some Arabic and the Korean domain also allow that).

Life Descended from the painter Antonio Busca, he belonged to a noble Milanese family. He officially entered the Order of Malta on 11 March 1779. On 11 June 1820 Busca was unanimously elected Lieutenant of the Order by its Council; before the election three members of the Council had left because of their opposition to Busca's nomination.H.J.A. Sire, The Knights of Malta, A Modern Resurrection (London: Third Millennium, 2016), 78‚Äì79. The Lieutenant was the head of the Order in the absence of a Grand Master (who would not be elected until 1879). In June 1821 Busca visited the Order's headquarters, the Convent, in Catania, Sicily. He was sworn in as Lieutenant and remained there two months before returning to Milan.Sire, 81. Like Andrea Di Giovanni y Centell√©s, his predecessor as Lieutenant, Busca unsuccessfully protested against the confiscation of Malta from the Order and Britain's continued rule of the island. In 1822 he organised a volunteer contingent of knights from the Order to assist against the Ottoman Empire in the Greek War of Independence, reviving the Order's crusader ideals. The Order's administration was then based in Catania, too far from the centres of European power and exposed to foreign incursions, so in 1826 Busca moved it to Ferrara, then within the Papal States. He was succeeded as Lieutenant on his death by Carlo Candida.

Life Carlo Candida was from a noble family of Neapolitan origin. Before his election as lieutenant he was admiral of the Order's naval fleet then territorial commander of the Order's lands in Rome, Barletta and Capua, which had at that time been confiscated from the Order. During his time as lieutenant he succeeded in getting them returned to the Order and also implemented the move of the Order's base from Ferrara to Rome, completed on 2 June 1834, putting the Order under direct papal protection at the heart of Christendom. In Rome Candida began setting up a hospital in 1841 in the outbuildings of the church of San Francesco at Ponte Sisto, run by papal officials who were also knights of the Order, though this was not long-lasting and closed after a fire in 1844. Under Candida's leadership, the Order finally rose from its 1798 fall and was even able to get help from the other European powers then in control of Italy - by a sovereign order of 15 January 1839, Ferdinand I of Austria re-established the Grand Priory of Lombardy and Venice, basing it in a palazzo in Venice next to the civic church of Saint John the Baptist, patron of the Order. Simultaneously Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies re-established the Baliaggio di Napoli and the duchies of Modena, Lucca and Parma reintroduced the Order's commanderies into their territories. The Order also established itself in the Kingdom of Piedmont in 1844, under the protection of king Carlo Alberto. On his death in Rome in 1845 Candida was buried in the church of San Francesco and succeeded as lieutenant by Filippo di Colloredo-Mels.

Mike Britton was the offensive coordinator from 1992 through the 2000 season starting his own semi-pro team, the St. Lawrence Trailblazers in 2002. The Red and Black have made the playoffs every year since 1993. The team briefly played in the New York Amateur Football League (now the Northeastern Football Alliance) in the late 1990s, but a few years later, moved back to the EFL. In 2003 they won the Northern Division Championship. Twenty-first century =2000s= In 2005 agency producers contacted several AFA member teams regarding use of players and coaches to give their TV commercials the professional football appearance they were looking for. One such Chunky soup commercial, featuring Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb did just that. Several Empire League football players were used in the production of that popular TV spot. The agency relied heavily on the coaching experience of AFA Hall of Famer George Ashcraft from the EFL's Watertown Red and Black team. Ashcraft provided the agency with the technical football advice (and several EFL players) they needed to make the McNabb/Chunky soup commercial convincing to the viewers. It is the Red & Black players and other EFL players wearing the Cleveland Browns uniforms. In 2006 the Red & Black was the floater team for the EFL. They played all of the teams once. They were the only floater team, but were still considered a Northern Division team. They won the Northern Division Championship game against the Vermont Ice Storm and lost to the Albany Metro Mallers in the EFL championship game. In 2007, the team finished with a 12‚Äì4 overall record. They were the 2007 Western Division Champs and lost in the EFL championship game to the Vermont Ice Storm 9‚Äì8. They went on to play in the National Tournament at Watertown High School. Before the game there was a tribute in memory of a fallen coach and soldier, Dave Connell, who lost his life in Iraq. The Tenth Mountain Division at Fort Drum landed a helicopter on the field before the game to deliver the game ball. Four members of the Watertown Red & Black team returned home from Iraq that week and played in the game. They were Ben Pritchard, Lorenzo Sanchez, Gregory Duckson, and Mike Jester. The team lost to the Monroe County Sting of the New York Amateur Football League 21‚Äì6. Monroe went on to win the National Championship game. Long-time veteran Earnie Wash also returned home from Iraq earlier in the season to finish the year. The 2008 season saw Thomas Schultz of Sports Partners Inc. claim that he \\"bought\\" the team, with intentions to move it back to the Northeastern Football Alliance. The owners of the Red & Black denied this, and a court settlement eventually led to Schultz being barred from using the \\"Red & Black\\" name. Schultz's team took to the field as the Watertown Revolution for the NFA, with no further connection to the Red & Black. (The Revolution later relocated to the nearby town of Carthage. The original Red & Black played in the EFL and finished with a 4‚Äì7 overall record. The Red & Black rebounded in 2009 to win the Empire Football League championship over the Plattsburgh North Stars 6‚Äì0 at the Alex Duffy Fairgrounds. Almost 3000 fans packed around the field to watch the team win its first EFL Championship since 1980. The Team finished with a 13‚Äì1 overall record. The Red and Black did go to Florida and played the Carolina Express in the Orange Blossom Bowl in January. After a hard fought battle the Red and Black came up short and lost 7‚Äì6. Running back Anthony Noel and LB Dustin Houppert received honors for the team for their outstanding play. The team finished with over 3,800 yards in offense. The defense posted seven shutouts. The Red and Black was ranked 20th in the nation on October 13. =2010s= To start the 2010 season the Watertown Red & Black traveled to Florida to play in the Orange Blossom Bowl. The Red and Black played The Carolina Express. It was a hard fought battle but the Red & Black came up short losing 7‚Äì6. Dustin Houppert and Anthony Noel received honors for the team for their great play. The Red & Black took the field in June with no choice but to defend their title. The team finished with a 12‚Äì3 overall record making it to their second championship in two years. The team lost to the Plattsburgh Northstars in the Championship game 13-10. The R&B; missed a field goal with 22 seconds left that would have put the game in overtime. The Red and Black finished another great season. Quarterback Brian Williams and running back Joe Brennan led the offense both rushing over a thousand yards. This was the first time since 1902. Also Mike Dumaw led the defense receiving all league honors becoming the second player on the Red & Black team to be the EFL Iron man of the year. In 2011, the team finished 6v6. After starting the season 1‚Äì4 the Red and Black regrouped and surge into the playoffs beating the Glenns Falls Greenjackets on the road for the first round of playoffs. The team will never forget that day after the events that led up to the game. Being the true underdogs the Red and Black pulled out a 17‚Äì10 victory after trailing 10-0. A week later the team lost to the Syracuse Shock in a hard fought battle to finish the season 6-6. The team also earned many EFL honors at the end of the season. In 2012, the Red and Black finished with a 9‚Äì5 overall record falling to the Plattsburgh North Stars in the second round of the EFL Playoffs. The Red and Black had some very bright moments in 2012 defeating League Champs the Monore County Sting and previously League runner up the Syracuse Shock. The team once again finished with many players receiving EFL honors. In 2013, the team finished with a 4‚Äì7 overall record. With many new faces the team was still a forceful competitor in the League. Unable to keep momentum due to bye weeks the Watertown footballers had some very bright moments. Beating the Northstars at home for the first time since the 2009 EFL Championship and Winning on the Road in a non league game vs the Impact who later went on to win the NFA Championship. The record does not indicate how good the team really was with 2014 looking to be a brighter year The team canceled it's 2020 season amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was released November 04, 2010 for iPod Touch and iPhone devices, November 12, 2010 for the iPad, December 17, 2010 for Android OS devices. It was released for Windows Phone, on December 22, 2010. Also, in March 2011, versions for Samsung's Bada and Nokia's Symbian began to be distributed on their respective application channels. Just prior to E3 2011 Fruit Ninja Kinect, which utilizes the Kinect peripheral, was released for the Xbox 360 on August 10, 2011. Fruit Ninja was also released for Windows 8, on June 7, 2012. Versions with alternative names exist, such as Fruit Ninja HD on the iPad, Fruit Ninja THD for Nvidia Tegra 2‚Äìbased Android devices, Fruit Ninja VR for HTC Vive and PlayStation 4, and an arcade version called Fruit Ninja FX. In the game, the player must slice fruit that is thrown into the air by swiping the device's touch screen with their finger(s) or in the case of the Xbox 360 version, the player's arms and hands. It features multiple gameplay modes, leaderboards and multiplayer. An iPad version, Fruit Ninja HD, was released on November 12, 2010. The game was well received by critics; in September 2010 sales exceeded three million downloads, four million in December 2010, and over 20 million across all platforms in March 2011. In May 2012, Fruit Ninja reached 300 million downloads. Reviewers felt that the low cost of the game combined with addictive gameplay yielded an excellent value. They further lauded the post-launch support provided by Halfbrick, which brought online multiplayer, achievements, and leaderboards to the game. Some critics felt the game's difficulty curve was uneven. Gameplay Fruit Ninja is played by using a touch pad to slice on-screen fruit. Additional points are awarded for slicing multiple fruit in one swipe. In Fruit Ninja, the player slices fruit with a blade controlled via the touch screen. As the fruit is thrown onto the screen, the player swipes their finger across the screen to create a slicing motion, attempting to slice the fruit in half. Extra points are awarded for slicing multiple fruits with one swipe (called \\"combo\\"s), and players can use additional fingers to make multiple slices simultaneously. Players must slice all fruit; if three fruits are missed, the game ends, (Unless Calligraphy Brush is used) but upon reaching scores that are multiples of one hundred, the player will gain an extra life (unless they have not missed a piece of fruit already). Bombs are occasionally thrown onto the screen, and will also end the game should the player slice them. (Unless Bomb deflects are used) A mode known as Zen mode allows players to seek high scores without the hindrance of bombs appearing on the screen, but players only have a minute and thirty seconds. Also available is an Arcade mode in which players have only sixty seconds to achieve a high score. In this mode, special bananas can appear which have unique bonuses such as doubling points scored for a limited time, increasing the amount of fruit on the screen, or slowing down the movement of all fruit for a short period of time. There are also bombs that deduct 10 points from the player's score. In Classic and Arcade mode, special pomegranates are occasionally thrown on screen. In Arcade Mode, it is guaranteed that at the end of each game that a pomegranate will appear. Players can slice these multiple times to get extra points. Similarly, an ultra rare dragonfruit sometimes appears in Classic mode which, if sliced, awards players fifty points. When Fruit Ninja celebrated its second anniversary, Halfbrick released an update with a new feature called Gutsu's Cart, which comprises two characters, a pig named Truffles and a human named Gutsu. In the various modes of the game, the player can earn starfruit to purchase items in Gutsu's Cart. There are three purchasable items at the cart which are used in the game; Berry Blast causes sliced strawberries to explode and gives the player five extra points. Another item is Peachy Times: slicing a peach in Zen or Arcade mode gives the player two extra seconds. The third item is Bomb Deflects which enables the player to deflect Bombs upon accidentally slicing them. Starfruit can be obtained after each game, proportional to the score, or by slicing the semi-rare starfruit. In the fifth anniversary update to Fruit Ninja, Gutsu's Cart was removed and instead replaced with a power-up menu that used starfruit to buy the three power-ups in the game. Berry Blast power-ups were priced at 120 starfruit, Peachy Times power-ups were priced at 100 starfruit, and Bomb Deflect power-ups were priced at 80 starfruit. In addition, certain dojos and blades now had different effects that took place within the Classic, Arcade, and Zen game modes. For example, if a player owned the Cherry Blossom dojo, the power-up costs were 50% off. A new festival mode was added in as well, where players could compete against the game's artificial intelligence by paying Gold Apples to challenge an AI player. There were also mini-games added to challenge the skills of newcomers and experts alike. Multiplayer gameplay is supported on iOS devices through Apple's Game Center application. It allows for competitive gameplay and features leaderboards and achievements. During multiplayer matches, the player's blade and fruit are highlighted in blue, while the opponent's are highlighted in red. White outlined fruit are considered neutral and may be claimed by either player. White outlined fruit are worth three points. Players must slice their own fruit while avoiding their opponent's fruit. The iPad version of the game features enhanced graphics and also supports local multiplayer, with the screen being divided in half and each player controlling half of the screen. Players can also share high scores via OpenFeint, Twitter and Facebook. Development and marketing In an interview with GameSpot, Phil Larsen, Chief Marketing Officer at Halfbrick discussed the development of Fruit Ninja. He stated, \\"we tried a lot of different channels [...] indie games, PSN, XBLA, [...] and we basically did a lot of research about what was happening on iPhone and made a game that worked out pretty well.\\" He then spoke of the company's brainstorming process for new games and said \\"Fruit Ninja came as part of [that] process, but we identified it as something special [and] decided to fast-track it through.\\" Luke Muscat, Lead Designer for Fruit Ninja stated that he felt the uniqueness of the touch screen platforms and the short development cycle further motivated Halfbrick to develop the game. The game was first released on November 04, 2010, for iPod Touch and iPhone devices. It was later released as Fruit Ninja HD on November 12, 2010 for the iPad. On November 17, 2010, Fruit Ninja was ported to Android OS devices. On November 2, 2010, an Arcade mode was announced for Fruit Ninja which adjusted gameplay dynamics.

The game was also released for Windows Phone 7 on December 22, 2010. Phil Larsen stated that due to the quick-release nature of iOS applications that a different marketing strategy is required. \\"You could have a game rise to the top and fall off in three days. You want to get it up there at the right time and have the right backup plan to sustain it with updates and further press\\" he said. On January 21, 2011 an update was released for the Android version of the game which added Arcade mode, leaderboards, and an ice blade to the game. A Windows port of the game was launched in June 2011.

The free- to-play game port was published as a beta in April 2011, and Halfbrick described it as \\"60 second gameplay with many powerups, unlockables and achievements\\". The Facebook version received several updates and was available from November 18, 2012 until the game underwent sunset closure on November 30, 2013. In mid-2011, an amusement arcade version appeared titled Fruit Ninja FX. On August 10, 2011, Fruit Ninja Kinect was released for the Xbox 360 console as a downloadable game from the Xbox Live Arcade (XBLA) Marketplace. It was the first XBLA game to make use of the motion-sensing Kinect controller.List of Xbox Live Arcade Kinect games On screen, the fruit-slicing concept is enhanced by the Kinect to include the player's entire self; the camera places a shadowy silhouette of the player's body upon a background scene, and arm and hand movements are visualized as blade-slashing arcs to slice fruit. To promote the Xbox 360 game, a voucher token for Fruit Ninja Kinect was included in the retail box of The Gunstringer, a separate Kinect title developed by Twisted Pixel Games. Fruit Ninja Kinect received its first additional downloadable content (DLC) on August 24, 2011.

The expression is still famous around the globe and used to inspire people for self-help. The phrase originated in ancient Greece as \\"the Gods help those who help themselves\\" and may originally have been proverbial. It is illustrated by two of Aesop's Fables and a similar sentiment is found in ancient Greek drama. Although it has been commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin, the modern English wording appears earlier in Algernon Sidney's work. The phrase is often mistaken as a scriptural quote, though it is not stated verbatim in the Bible. Some Christians have criticized the expression as being contrary to the Bible's message of God's grace. A variant of the phrase can also be found in the Quran (13:11).  Origin  The Persians The sentiment appears in several ancient Greek tragedies. Sophocles, in his Philoctetes (c. 409 BC), wrote, \\"No good e'er comes of leisure purposeless; And heaven ne'er helps the men who will not act.\\" Euripides, in the Hippolytus (428 BC), mentions that, \\"Try first thyself, and after call in God; For to the worker God himself lends aid.\\"Fragment 435, from Bartlett 1955(?) In his Iphigeneia in Tauris, Orestes says, \\"I think that Fortune watcheth o'er our lives, surer than we. But well said: he who strives will find his gods strive for him equally.\\" A similar version of this saying \\"God himself helps those who dare\\" better translated as \\"divinity helps those who dare\\" \\"audentes deus ipse iuuat\\" comes from Ovid, Metamorphoses, 10.586. The phrase is spoken by Hippomenes when contemplating whether to enter a foot race against Atalanta for her hand in marriage. If Hippomenes were to lose, however, he would be killed. Hippomenes decides to challenge Atalanta to a race and, with the aid of Venus, Hippomenes was able to win the race. The same concept is found in the fable of Hercules and the Wagoner, first recorded by Babrius in the 1st century AD. In it, a wagon falls into a ravine, or in later versions becomes mired, but when its driver appeals to Hercules for help, he is told to get to work himself.For other versions see: Aesop is also credited with a similar fable about a man who calls on the goddess Athena for help when his ship is wrecked and is advised to try swimming first. It has been conjectured that both stories were created to illustrate an already existing proverb. The French author Jean de La Fontaine also adapted the first of these fables as Le chartier embourb√© (Fables VI.18) and draws the moral Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera (Help yourself and Heaven will help you too). A little earlier, George Herbert had included \\"Help thyself, and God will help thee\\" in his proverb collection, Jacula Prudentum (1651). But it was the English political theorist Algernon Sidney who originated the now familiar wording, \\"God helps those who help themselves\\",) apparently the first exact rendering of the phrase. Benjamin Franklin later used it in his Poor Richard's Almanack (1736) and has been widely quoted.Wikiquote =Islamic texts= A passage with similar sentiments can be found in the Quran: It has a different meaning in that it implies that helping oneself is a prerequisite for expecting the help of God. Trust in God But Tie Your Camel is an Arab proverb with a similar meaning. It is also one of the reported sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. According to Tirmidhi, one day Mohammed noticed a Bedouin leaving his camel without tying it. He asked the Bedouin, \\"Why don't you tie down your camel?\\" The Bedouin answered, \\"I placed my trust in Allah.\\" At that, Mohammed said, \\"Tie your camel and place your trust in Allah.\\" = Other historical uses = The French society Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera (Help yourself and Heaven will help you too) played an important role in bringing about the July Revolution of 1830 in France. The Canadian society Aide-toi, le Ciel t‚Äôaidera is credited with introducing the celebration of Saint-Jean- Baptiste Day for French Canadians, and was founded by Louis-Victor Sicotte. Aide-toi et Dieu t'aidera (Help yourself, and God will help you) was the motto on the ship's wheel of the famous UK-built Confederate sea raider CSS Alabama, captained by Raphael Semmes during the American Civil War.  Prevalence and assessment  The phrase is often quoted to emphasize the importance of taking initiative. There is also a relationship to the Parable of the Faithful Servant, and the Parable of the Ten Virgins, which has a similar eschatological theme: be prepared for the day of reckoning. However, the argument has been made that this is a non-Biblical concept. =Christian Scripture= While the term does not appear verbatim in Christian scriptures, these passages are used to suggest an ethic of reliance on God. * - Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men. * - The Lord will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. * - A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest‚Äîand poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man. * - He who works his land will have abundant food, but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment. * - Diligent hands will rule, but laziness ends in slave labor. * - The sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied. * - The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord. * - God blesses those who realize their need for him; and who mourn will be comforted. * - If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Reliance upon God is not mentioned, but is strongly implied. Conversely, instances where Jesus served or healed someone would be evidence of God helping those who cannot help themselves. (See Mark 6:34; Mark 1:30-31; and Mark 10:46-52.) =Prevailing views= The belief that this is a phrase that occurs in the Bible, or is even one of the Ten Commandments, is common in the United States.\\", posted on Worldview Weekend The beliefs of Americans regarding this phrase and the Bible has been studied by Christian demographer and pollster George Barna of The Barna Group. To the statement \\"The Bible teaches that God helps those who help themselves\\"; 53% of Americans agree strongly, 22% agree somewhat, 7% disagree somewhat, 14% disagree strongly, and 5% stated they don't know. Of \\"born- again\\" Christians 68% agreed, and 81% of non \\"born-again\\" Christians agreed with the statement. In a February 2000 poll, 53% strongly agreed and 22% agreed somewhat that the Bible teaches the phrase. Of the 14 questions asked, this was the least biblical response, according to Barna. As cited in A poll in the late 1990s showed the majority (81%) believe the concept is taught by the Bible,Barna poll in 1997 and 1998, as cited on websites. Additionally, another stating 82%. as cited in \\" Despite being of non-Biblical origin the phrase topped a poll of the most widely known Bible verses., As cited in \\" Seventy-five percent of American teenagers said they believed that it was the central message of the Bible.Barna poll in 1997, according to one website; c.2006 according to another; and Barna, \\"The Bible,\\" 2000, according to another Barna critiques this as evidence of Americans' unfamiliarity with the Bible and believes that the statement actually conflicts with the doctrine of Grace in Christianity. It \\"suggests a spiritual self-reliance inconsistent with Christianity\\" according to David Kinnaman, vice president of the Barna Research Group. as cited in , Christian minister Erwin Lutzer argues there is some support for this saying in the Bible (, ); however, much more often God helps those who cannot help themselves, which is what grace is about (the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, , ). The statement is often criticised as espousing a Semi-Pelagian model of salvation, which most Christians denounce as heresy.

It was launched on September 28, 2003 from the European Space Agency's spaceport in French Guiana on board the Ariane rocket. The satellite had a launch mass of 2750 kilograms. It is the 4th satellite launched in the INSAT-3 series for INSAT. It was designed for providing high-speed communication, Television, VSAT & Tele-education services and was an important landmark in Indian Space Programme. In April 2014, almost eleven years after being launched, the satellite ran out of oxidizer and a few days later, was decommissioned by the ISRO. In a few days time, it will be moved to a graveyard orbit.http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/after-10-years-in- orbit-insat3e-expires/article5859974.ece  Launch  INSAT 3E was launched from Kourou, French Guyana on September 28, 2003 on European consortium Ariane space's Ariane 5-V162 launcher along with two other satellites viz. Eurobird 3 of Eutelsat and SMART-1 of European Space Agency at 4.44 am IST.It was placed into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) 30 minutes after the lift-off, in 3-axis stabilised mode, with a perigee of 649 km and an apogee of 35,923 km and an inclination of 7 deg. with respect to the equator. Its Master Control Facility(MCF) is at Hassan,Karnataka(India).  Payload  INSAT 3E payload consists of C-band and extended C-band transponders. It has 24 C-band transponders, having India beam coverage providing an Edge Of Coverage- Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EOC-EIRP) of 38.5 dBW and 12 upper extended C-band transponders having India beam coverage providing an EOC-EIRP of 38 dBW. Retirement On April 1, 2014, Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, while speaking to the Indian English newspaper \\"The Hindu\\", said that INSAT 3E had been decommissioned. The newspaper reported that a few days before, the satellite had run out of the on-board oxidiser, which is essential to burn the fuel that kept it Earth-locked (fixed over India) and running its daily functions. The ISRO had apparently expected that the satellite, positioned at 55 degrees E longitude, would last a few more months and that it would be smoothly replaced with GSAT-16. The Master Control Facility at Hassan is due to move the expired satellite into a graveyard orbit.

It is based at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. History The first U.S. astronaut candidates were selected by NASA in 1959, for its Project Mercury with the objective of orbiting astronauts around the Earth in single-man capsules. The military services were asked to provide a list of military test pilots who met specific qualifications. After stringent screening, NASA announced its selection of the \\"Mercury Seven\\" as its first astronauts. Since then, NASA has selected 20 more groups of astronauts, opening the corps to civilians, scientists, doctors, engineers, and school teachers. As of the 2009 Astronaut Class 61% of the astronauts selected by NASA have come from military service. NASA selects candidates from a diverse pool of applicants with a wide variety of backgrounds. From the thousands of applications received, only a few are chosen for the intensive Astronaut Candidate training program. Including the \\"Original Seven\\", 339 candidates have been selected to date. Organization The Astronaut Corps is based at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, although members may be assigned to other locations based on mission requirements, e.g. Soyuz training at Star City, Russia. The Chief of the Astronaut Office is the most senior leadership position for active astronauts in the Corps. The Chief Astronaut serves as head of the Corps and is the principal adviser to the NASA Administrator on astronaut training and operations. The first Chief Astronaut was Deke Slayton, appointed in 1962. The current Chief Astronaut is Patrick Forrester. =Salary= Salaries for newly hired civilian astronauts are based on the federal government's General Schedule pay scale for grades GS-11 through GS-14. The astronaut's grade is based on his or her academic achievements and experience.NASA ‚Äì Astronaut Selection Astronauts can be promoted up to grade GS-15. As of 2015, astronauts based at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, earn between $66,026 (GS-11 step 1) and $158,700 (GS-15 step 8 and above). Military astronauts are detailed to the Johnson Space Center and remain on active duty for pay, benefits, leave, and similar military matters. Qualifications There are no age restrictions for the NASA Astronaut Corps. Astronaut candidates have ranged between the ages of 26 and 46, with the average age being 34. Candidates must be U.S. citizens to apply for the program. There are three broad categories of qualifications: education, work experience, and medical. Candidates must have a master's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics.https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/explorers-wanted-nasa-to-hire- more-artemis-generation-astronauts The degree must be followed by at least two to three years of related, progressively responsible, professional experience (graduate work or studies) or at least 1,000 hours of pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for experience, such as a doctoral degree (which counts as the two years experience). Teaching experience, including experience at the K ‚Äì 12 levels, is considered to be qualifying experience. Candidates must have the ability to pass the NASA long-duration space flight physical, which includes the following specific requirements: * Distant and near visual acuity: Must be correctable to 20/20, each eye separately (corrective lenses such as glasses are allowed) * The refractive surgical procedures of the eye, PRK and LASIK, are allowed, providing at least 1 year has passed since the date of the procedure with no permanent adverse after effects. * Blood pressure not to exceed 140/90 measured in a sitting position * Standing height between 62 and 75 inches Members =Astronauts= the corps has 48 active astronauts consisting of 16 women and 32 men or 33.3% female and 66.7% male The corps also has 18 \\"management astronauts\\", who are \\"employed at NASA but are no longer eligible for flight assignment\\". The highest number of active astronauts at one time was in 2000 when there were 149. All of the current astronaut corps are from the classes of 1996 (Group 16) or later. There are currently 19 \\"international active astronauts\\", \\"who are assigned to duties at the Johnson Space Center\\", who were selected by their home agency but trained with and serve alongside their NASA counterparts. International astronauts, Payload Specialists, and Spaceflight Participants are not considered members of the NASA Astronaut Corps. =Astronaut Candidates= The term \\"Astronaut Candidate\\" (informally \\"ASCAN\\") refers to individuals who have been selected by NASA as candidates for the NASA Astronaut Corps and are currently undergoing a candidacy training program at the Johnson Space Center. The most recent class of Astronaut Candidates was selected in 2017 after receiving more than 18,300 applications. Upon completion of a two-year training program, they were promoted to the rank of Astronaut in January 2020. Only three Astronaut Candidates have resigned before completing training: Brian O'Leary and Anthony Llewellyn, both from the 1967 Selection Group, and Robb Kulin of the 2017 group. O'Leary resigned in April 1968 after additional Apollo missions were cancelled, Llewellyn resigned in August 1968 after failing to qualify as a jet pilot, and Kulin resigned in August 2018 for unspecified personal reasons.chron.com/news/nation-world/space/article/2017-NASA-astronaut- candidate-resigning-this-month-13185081.php =Former members= Selection as an Astronaut Candidate and subsequent promotion to Astronaut does not guarantee the individual will eventually fly in space. Some have voluntarily resigned or been medically disqualified after becoming astronauts but before being selected for flights. Civilian candidates are expected to remain with the Corps for at least five years after initial training; military candidates are assigned for specific tours. After these time limits, members of the Astronaut Corps may resign or retire at any time. Three members of the Astronaut Corps (Gus Grissom, Edward White, and Roger B. Chaffee) were killed during a ground test accident while preparing for the Apollo 1 mission. Eleven were killed during spaceflight, on Space Shuttle missions STS-51-L and STS-107.Three Payload Specialists were also killed on the two missions. Another four (Elliot See, Charles Bassett, Theodore Freeman, and Clifton Williams) were killed in T-38 plane crashes during training for space flight during the Gemini and Apollo programs. Another was killed in a 1967 automobile accident, and another died in a 1991 commercial airliner crash while traveling on NASA business. Two members of the Corps have been involuntarily dismissed: Lisa Nowak and William Oefelein. Both were returned to service with the U.S. Navy.

He belonged to the Golitsyn as well as Romodanovsky Muscovite noble families and his main political opponent was his cousin Prince Boris Alexeyevich Golitsyn. Life Golitsyn spent his early days at the court of Tsar Aleksey Mikhailovich (reigned 1645-1676), where he gradually rose to the rank of boyar. In 1676 he was sent to Ukraine to restrain the Crimean Tatars and took part in the Chigirin campaign of the Russo-Turkish War of 1676-1681. Personal experience of the inconveniences and dangers of the prevailing system of preferment - the so-called mestnichestvo, or rank priority, which had paralyzed the Russian armies for centuries - induced him to propose its abolition, which Tsar Feodor III carried out in 1678. The May revolution of 1682 placed Vasily Golitsyn at the head of the Posolsky Prikaz, or Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and during the regency (1682-1689) of Sophia (the half-sister of Peter the Great) whose intimate friend he became, he served as the principal minister of state (1682‚Äì1689) and as keeper of the great seal, a title bestowed upon only two Russians before him, Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin (1605-1680) and Artamon Matveyev (1625-1682). In home affairs his influence was insignificant, but his foreign policy was distinguished by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), which set the Russo-Chinese border north of the Amur River, and by the Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686 with Poland, whereby Russia at last definitively recovered Kiev. By the terms of the same treaty, Russia acceded to the grand league against the Porte, but Golitsyn's two expeditions against the Crimea (Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689) proved unsuccessful and made him extremely unpopular. Only with the utmost difficulty could Sophia get the young tsar Peter to decorate the defeated commander-in-chief as if he had returned a victor. In the political contest between Sophia and Peter of August‚ÄìSeptember 1689, Golitsyn half-heartedly supported his mistress and shared her ruin. Peter spared his life - owing to the supplications of his cousin Boris - but deprived him of his boyardom, confiscated his estates and banished him successively to Kargopol, to Mezen and to Kholmogory, where he died on 21 April 1714. Golitsyn was unusually well educated. He was a great friend of foreigners, who generally alluded to him as \\"the great Golitsyn\\". He expounded to them some drastic reform measures, such as the abolition of serfdom, the promotion of religious toleration, and the development of industrial enterprises. As Golitsyn was eager to avoid all forms of violence and repression, his program was more cautious and \\"realistic\\" than that of Peter the Great. Political upheavals prevented him from executing any of these plans.

Prince Boris Alexeyevich Galitzin (surname sometimes transcribed Golitsyn (; 1654‚Äì1714) was a Russian politician, aristocrat of the Galitzin family. His chief political opponent was his own cousin Prince Vasily Vasilyevich Golitsyn. Life Boris was a court Chamberlain since 1676. He was the young tsar Peter the Great's chief supporter when, in 1689, Peter resisted the usurpations of his elder sister Sophia, and the head of the loyal council which assembled at the Trinity monastery during the crisis of the struggle. It was Golitsyn who suggested taking refuge in that strong fortress and won over the boyars of the opposite party. In 1690 he was created a boyar and shared with Lev Naryshkin, Peter's uncle, the conduct of home affairs. After the death of the tsaritsa Natalia, Peter's mother, in 1694, his influence increased still further. He accompanied Peter to the White Sea (1694‚Äì1695); took part in the Azov campaign (1695); and was one of the triumvirate who ruled Russia during Peters first foreign tour (1697‚Äì1698). The Astrakhan rebellion (1706), which affected all the districts under his government, shook Peter's confidence in him, and seriously impaired his position. In 1707 he was superseded in the Volgan provinces by Andrei Matveev. A year before his death he entered a monastery. Golitsyn was a typical representative of Russian society of the end of the 17th century leaning towards Westernism. In many respects he was far in advance of his time. He was highly educated, spoke Latin with graceful fluency, frequented the society of scholars and had his children carefully educated according to the best European models. Yet this eminent, superior personage was an habitual drunkard, an uncouth savage who intruded upon the hospitality of wealthy foreigners, and was not ashamed to seize upon any dish he took a fancy to, and send it home to his wife.

Golitsyn was sent by Peter the Great in 1697 to Italy to learn military affairs; in 1704 he was appointed to the command of an auxiliary corps in Poland against Charles XII; from 1711 to 1718 he was governor of Belgorod. In 1718 he was appointed president of the newly erected Commerce Collegium and a senator.

After the death of Peter the Great, Golitsyn became the recognized head of the old Conservative party which had never forgiven Peter for divorcing Eudoxia and marrying the plebeian Martha Skavronskaya (Catherine I of Russia). But the reformers, as represented by Alexander Menshikov and Peter Tolstoi, prevailed; and Golitsyn remained in the background till the fall of Menshikov, 1727. During the last years of Peter II (1728‚Äì1730), Golitsyn was the most prominent statesman in Russia and his high aristocratic theories had full play.

A 7.62√ó51mm NATO round is used because that is the round fired by the M40A6, which is the primary rifle used by Marine snipers. Significance According to military superstition, there is ultimately one round destined to end the life of each person, \\"the bullet with your name on it.\\" Until that round is fired, the person for which it is intended is invincible. If the sniper carries this round at all times, it can never be fired and the sniper is therefore untouchable. The term \\"HOG\\" is actually an acronym derived from the title \\"Hunter Of Gunmen\\", which is the colloquial name for a sniper who killed an enemy sniper in combat. He then has to take a round from the enemy sniper's chamber‚Äîthat's the one \\"with his name on it\\". The bullet is then worn as a necklace and symbolizes the tooth of a real hog, expressing his status as a \\"Hunter Of Gunmen\\".

He was the governor of Saint Petersburg in 1780 to 1783. Life =Early life= As was traditional for noble families, Golitsyn's name was inscribed as a captain on the list of the Life Guards while still a child. He lost his father aged 13. The family was then out of favour with empress Anna of Russia and so Alexander could not count on high patronage, so went to spend 17 years in Austria, where he fought in the Austrian army and gained the notice of Prince Eugene of Savoy. On his return to Russia in 1740 Alexander was sent to Constantinople in the entourage of ambassador A Rumyantsev, but soon received a new assignment, as Russian Minister Plenipotentiary to the Dukes of Saxony at Dresden.Lib.ru/ –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å –∏ –ø—Ä–∏–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ—è –ë–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ–≤–∞. –û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–∞–º–∏–º –∏–º –¥–ª—è —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º–∫–æ–≤ =Seven Years' War= Elizabeth of Russia came to the throne at the end of 1741 and the Golitsyn family returned to royal favour. During her reign Alexander successfully climbed the military and diplomatic career ladder and by 1744 was already at the rank of lieutenant general. In 1757 he was appointed to a command in the army fighting Prussia in the Seven Years' War. In 1758 he distinguished himself by capturing –¢orea and at Kunersdorf commanded the Russian left flank. Pyotr Saltykov's battleplan depended on deliberately drawing Frederick II of Prussia's troops to attack the Russian left flank, so that the enemy could then be attacked from the centre and the right flank. Golitsyn had a hard time and after a staunch defence his troops were ultimately unable to survive the Prussian infantry and cavalry onslaught and retreated, with Alexander himself wounded. Military historians later found an analogy between this situation and Bagration's troops on the Russian left flank at Borodino, who were also the main target of the enemy assault and withdrew, with Bagration fatally wounded and unable to build on his success. At Kunersdorf, however, Saltykov's battleplan was a success and Frederick lost the battle, with Golitsyn awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky and the rank of general-in-chief by Elizabeth. At the end of the war with Prussia, he was appointed commander of Russian troops in Livonia. =Russo-Turkish War= On Catherine II of Russia's accession in 1762 Golitsyn was awarded the Order of Saint Andrew and the title of the Adjutant General. By becoming a member of the High Court Council, he used the empress's influence and his diplomatic and military knowledge. At the start of the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774), Golitsyn was entrusted with the command of an army, with which he moved on Khotyn. Splitting 40th Corps, he did not dare assault the city and withdrew to re-supply his troops and strengthen his rearguard. In 1769 he moved on Khotyn again and began to besiege it. The arrival of fresh Turkish and Tartar troops could bolster the besieged garrison and increase Russian casualties during the final assault, so he decided to raise the siege and led the army from the Dnieper, hoping to draw the enemy garrison out into open battle on ground favourable to him. In the meantime Catherine decided to replace Golitsyn as general-in-chief with Pyotr Rumyantsev, who she hoped would act more decisively, but before Rumyantsev's arrival Golitsyn succeeded into drawing the Turkish forces onto favourable ground: Under the command of Supreme Vizier Moldavanchi, they attacked Golitsyn's force on 29 August and were defeated, losing up to 7,000 men, around 70 guns and all their baggage. Without delay, Golitsyn's army began to pursue the enemy, capturing Khotyn on 9 September; its garrison and many residents fled, leaving the city half-empty. Golitsyn then handed the army over to Rumyantsev and returned to Saint Petersburg, where Catherine welcomed him and made him a field marshal on 20 October 1769. After the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca Golitsyn was awarded with a diamond sword with an inscription that translated \\"For the purification of Moldova as far as Ia≈üi\\" and the 69th Infantry Regiment was renamed after him. The military writer Dmitri Bantysh-Kamensky recounts how Golitsyn invited Saltykov, under whom he had fought at Kunersdorf, to visit the Dormition Cathedral. As they both entered the church, nobody was inside it and Saltykov said to Golitsyn \\"It's as empty as Khotyn\\". =Later career= Monument to Golitsyn by Fyodor Gordeyev After the war Golitsyn became one of the Russian statesmen who were Catherine's close confidants. In 1769 he was made a member of the board at the imperial court, in 1772 adjutant general, in December 1774 a senator, from 1775 to 1782 a member of the council for 1st Cadet Corps (as commander of the 1,777 troops stationed in Livonia), from September 1778 senior director of the revisions board and from May 1779 a position on the commission for the structure of the capital and other cities. In 1780, at Golitsyn's initiative, the nobility of the province of Saint Petersburg decided to award Catherine the title \\"Mother of the Fatherland\\", but she refused it; at the refusal, Golitsyn replied \\"Do not purchase empty names as the subject of my reign, but that of bringing good and calm to the fatherland\\". Golitsyn was governor general of Saint Petersburg in 1775 and from 1780 to 1783 and carried out several public works to beautify it. In 1775 he completed the casting of the equestrian statue of Peter I for the city. By decree of Catherine, on April 17, 1775, a new general school was set up in the city. He also established loans schemes and put on Dana's first Russian opera, 'Cephalus and Procris'. He reformed the city's police in 1782, dividing it into 10 police districts, opened the Obukhov insane asylum and built stone storehouses on New Holland island. On 7 August 1782 he inaugurated the Peter the Great monument on Senate Square. He was one of the eleven people awarded the ribbon of the Order of Saint Vladimir at its establishment on 22 September 1782. He died in 1783 and was buried in the Church of the Annunciation at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

The policy underlying the proclamation was inaugurated by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and continued after the ratification of the United States Constitution by the Nonintercourse Acts of 1790, 1793, 1796, 1799, 1802, and 1833.Robert J.

Clinton, The Proclamation of 1763: Colonial Prelude to Two Centuries of Federal-State Conflict over the Management of Indian Affairs, 69 B.U. L. Rev. 329, 369 (1989). During the Articles of Confederation-era, several U.S. states, particularly New York, purchased lands from Indians without the consent of Congress. In the 1980s, in the wake of the Oneida I (1974) decision permitting tribes to pursue such claims in federal courts, several tribes challenged such conveyances as contrary to the Proclamation. However, the Second Circuit has held that Congress had neither the authority nor the intent to prohibit such purchases within the borders of individual states, and thus that the Proclamation applied only to the federal territories. Text The Proclamation prohibits: > all persons from making settlements on lands inhabited or claimed by > Indians, without the limits or jurisdiction of any particular State, and > from purchasing or receiving any gift or cession of such lands or claims > without the express authority and directions of the United States in > Congress assembled. The Proclamation also declared: > that every very such purchase or settlement, gift or cession, not having the > authority aforesaid, is null and void, and that no right or title will > accrue in consequence of any such purchase, gift, cession or settlement.

It is a stereoisomer of the endogenous steroid hormone and estrogen 17Œ≤-estradiol (or simply estradiol). Medical uses Alfatradiol is used in form of an ethanolic solution for topical application on the scalp. Similarly to other drugs against alopecia, topical or oral, it has to be applied continuously to prevent further hair loss. Regrowth of hair that was already lost is only possible to a limited extent. In general, advanced alopecia does not respond well to medical treatment, which has historically been thought to be a consequence of the hair roots being lost. A university-led study (including several authors who are advisors to companies such as Pfizer) in 103 women comparing alfatradiol to minoxidil, another topical hair loss treatment, found the latter to be more effective. In contrast to minoxidil, alfatradiol did not result in an increase of hair density or thickness, but only in slowing down or stabilization of hair loss in this study. In an earlier study, no systemic side effects were noted, and 17Œ±-estradiol was found to reduce androgenic hair loss, though it was not effective at growing new hair. Other efforts of alfatradiol had been directed at neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's. Other hair loss medications include ketoconazole, finasteride, and dutasteride. Contraindications Nothing is known about the use of alfatradiol during pregnancy or lactation, or in patients under 18 years of age. The package leaflet recommends against using it under these circumstances. Side effects Local burning or itching is not an effect of alfatradiol, but of the ethanol in the solvent. The solution can stimulate sebum production. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Alfatradiol (top) and 17Œ≤-estradiol (bottom). Alfatradiol (17Œ±-estradiol) is distinguished from estradiol (17Œ≤-estradiol), the predominant sex hormone in females, only by the stereochemistry of the carbon atom 17. In contrast to 17Œ≤-estradiol, 17Œ±-estradiol, while it still binds to the estrogen receptor, has less or no feminizing estrogenic activity depending on its dosage and the tissue it is affecting. Alfatradiol acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme 5Œ±-reductase, which is responsible for the activation of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and which plays a role in regulating hair growth. 17Œ±-Estradiol has been studied as a therapeutic with potential to treat Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and other patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. 17Œ±-Estradiol (as the sodium salt of its sulfated form) is a minor component (<10%) of hormone replacement products (such as conjugated estrogens, brand name Premarin), which have been studied and/or marketed in women and men since the 1930s. A survey of the effects of various forms of 17Œ±-estradiol in humans on biochemical parameters, efficacy, estrogenicity, metabolism, safety, and tolerability has been published. Alfatradiol binds to the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ with 58% and 11% of the relative binding affinity of 17Œ≤-estradiol. However, it has 100-fold lower estrogenic activity relative to estradiol, which may in part be due to differences in the intrinsic activity of the two compounds. On the other hand, alfatradiol has been found to bind to and activate the brain-expressed ER-X with a greater potency than estradiol, indicating that it may be the predominant endogenous ligand for the receptor. In contrast to estradiol, alfatradiol is not a ligand of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (affinity >10 ŒºM). Society and culture =Generic names= Alfatradiol is the generic name of the drug and its . It is also known as 17Œ±-estradiol. =Brand names= Alfatradiol is marketed under the brand names Avicis, Avixis, Ell-Cranell Alpha, and Pantostin. =Availability= Alfatradiol is available in Germany and several Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Research Alfatradiol administered systemically improved metabolic function, reduced insulin resistance, decreased intra-abdominal fat, and decreased inflammation in old male mice without inducing feminization, suggesting potential usefulness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

One of the most common uses of hooks is in the back mount position to prevent escape. However, a practitioner may alternatively use hooks to defend, sweep, or attack their opponent. Uses Hooks are very important tools in the arsenal of a grappler. The effective use of the feet to manipulate the position of the opponent is essential to maintaining control of one's opponent. Both in offensive and defensive situations, locking in hooks gives an advantage of more points of contact with the opponent. This in turn increases the ability to impose submissions, and the ability to avoid them. =Offense= Offensive uses of hooks include the control of an opponent until the application of a submission hold, as with the Back mount position where the practitioner applies hooks to his opponent's thighs until he opts to apply a submission from the back, a very commonly used submission is the Rear naked choke. In some cases, hooks are used to apply the submissions itself, as with the Gogoplata submission where the hook is applied to the opponent's throat as a choke. =Defense= The use of hooks in defense consists of the practitioner using their feet to limit the advancement of their opponent as with the Half guard position, sweeping their opponent as seen with the Butterfly guard, and using hooks to counterattack opponents.  Positions and Applications  Judoka using butterfly guard during training. Notice the use of butterfly hooks on inside of thighs * Back / Rear mount - Hooks are locked into opponent's mid-thighs to prevent the opponent from escaping or reversing the position, hooks are also used in this position to add leverage to chokes. * Full mount - Hooks are locked below the calves of the opponent to increase downward pressure, they are also used to help base to prevent sweeps. * Butterfly guard - Butterfly hooks are locked in the inner thigh of opponent, and are used to keep opponent off balance. They also can be used to sweep an opponent, in order to advance to a more dominant position. Butterfly hooks are generally used in tandem with some combination of overhooks and/or underhooks to secure the butterfly guard. * Half guard - Hooks are locked on one leg of the opponent to prevent them from advancing to full mount or side control, generally a last defensive position before the opponent gains a dominant position, such as side control or full mount. * Open guard - Hooks are generally moving and are not locked as in other positions, can be in several different locations including, but not limited to, crook of the elbow, the hips, shin or calf, ribcage of the opponent, etc. In this position hooks are flexible and aid the practitioner in attempting sweeps, preventing guard passes or blocking strikes. * Spider guard Hooks are generally locked against arms of opponent to prevent strikes and limit guard passing, sometimes used to set up shoulder and armlocks. Spider guard also uses hooks to control other areas but this is one of the most common. * X-guard - Hooks are locked in opposition around one leg (creating the X shape for which the position is named), while the practitioner traps other leg with his arm. Hooks change position to sweep opponent in different directions, giving the practitioner the ability to vary his attacks and set up several different submission attempts. Related Techniques When the strategy of limiting the opponent‚Äôs movements is applied with the hands and arms rather than the feet and legs, generally in a Clinch fighting situation, it is referred to as Underhook(s) or Overhook(s), depending on the position of the practitioner‚Äôs arm(s) in relation to their opponent‚Äôs arm(s).

Life  Madeleine de Puisieux, was born in Paris on November 28, 1720. Although not much is known about her early life, Puisieux worked to become a published author. In 1745, she achieved her goal and with the help of her friend, Denis Diderot she published one of her first works entitled Les Caract√®res sometime in the year 1750. Puisieux also published one of her most famous works later that year entitled, La Femme n'est pas inf√©rieure √† l'homme (\\"Woman is not inferior to man\\"). This was a publication of a previously anonymous piece where Puisieux translated and brought up topics in the book about the equality of sexes. She based these questions found in the 1405 publication, La Cit√© des dames (The City of ladies) by Christine de Pisan. The following year, it was republished under the title Le Triomphe des dames (The Triumph of the ladies.) It is sometimes debated whether Puisieux's future husband Philippe-Florent de Puisieux (1713‚Äì1772) helped Puisieux with the translations used in the final publication. Born on November 28, 1713 and died in October 1772, Philippe was the French ambassador to Switzerland. Among other formalities, he was also a well-known lawyer at the Paris parliament. In the year 1750, Madeleine de Puisieux met and fell in love with Philippe-Florent de Puisieux, eventually marrying him.  Achievements  Throughout her relationships, Puisieux had no children. She however did seek opportunities to help the younger generation of girls by publishing advice books for girls. This made her name a well-known one among the population as Puisieux wanted to encourage girls to know about gender equality with feminism as her platform of teaching. With the wide known success of her works, Puisieux was recognized by the late, Louis XV. After his death in 1774, she settled down with her husband and was awarded a state pension in 1795.  Death  On April 12, 1798, Madeleine de Puisieux died in her hometown in Paris at the age of 77 years old.  Relationship with Denis Diderot  Madeleine de Puisieux had a relationship with longtime and fellow philosopher, art critic, Denis Diderot from 1746 to 1755. During that time she was a mistress. Although never married, she was the kept woman to Diderot during their time together. In that time, they worked together on some of Puisieux's works as he helped get the works published. Puisieux was not the only mistress to Diderot. She shared the title with Sophie Volland, and Mme de Maux.

(ed.) English Historical Documents 1042-1189, London, 1959. Bayeux Tapestry, p.238 His finger pointing to Duke William, whose left hand holding a club before the word DUX can be seen on the left side of the frame, seems to depict his urging the Duke to retreat, as the account in William of Poitiers relates of Eustace. The attribution to Turstin FitzRolf might otherwise have been plausible, due to the depicted figure's carrying of a pennon depicting a cross, apparently the Papal Banner. Turstin was described as having carried the \\"Gonfannon of the Normans\\" by Orderic Vitalis Turstin fitz Rolf, also known as Turstin le Blanc and Turstin fitz Rou played a prominent role in the Norman conquest of England and is regarded as one of the few proven companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He appears to have originated from Bec-de- Mortagne, Pays de Caux, Normandy, Name & origins As the prefix fitz indicates, Turstin was the son of a man called Rolf or Rou, names that are synonymous with their latinized equivalent Rollo (which may suggest descent from the founder of Normandy). The given name Turstin originated in the Old Norse √û√≥rst√¶inn (Thorstein; \\"Thor's stone\\") and is sometimes spelt Tosteins, Thurstan, Tostain and similar variants. The names Tostain or Toutain still exist in France nowadays, but as a surname, that was still concentrated in Normandy before World War II. Turstin appears to have originated in Bec-de- Mortagne, Pays-de-Caux, Normandy, about five miles south-east of F√©camp, according to the Roman de Rou poem written by Wace(c. 1115 - 1183): > Tosteins fitz Rou-le-Blanc out non, > Al Bec en Caux aveit meison > ([Modern French]: \\"Turstain fils de Rou le Blanc eut pour nom, > au Bec-en-Caux avait maison\\"; > [Modern English]: \\"Turstin FitzRou the White was his name, > had home at Bec-en-Caux.\\") In combat at Hastings Orderic Vitalis wrote, sometime after 1110, ‚ÄúTurstinus filius Rollonis vexillum Normannorum portavit‚Äù (\\"Turstin son of Rollo carried the standard of the Normans.\\")Orderic Vitalis, Historia Ecclesiastica Wace wrote in his cronicle Roman de Rou as follows (loosely translated and dramatised by Sir Edward Creasy(died 1878)): > Then the Duke called for the standard which the Pope had sent him, and, he > who bore it having unfolded it, the Duke took it and called to Raoul de > Conches. ‚ÄúBear my standard‚Äù said he ‚Äúfor I would not but do you right; by > right and by ancestry your line are standard-bearers of Normandy, and very > good knights have they all been‚Äù.

Then the Duke said > fiercely, ‚Äúby the splendour of God, my lords, I think you mean to betray and > fail me in this great need‚Äù.

The figure is shown in conversation with Duke William, and points to the rear, urging a retreat, as he is recorded as having done by William of Poitiers: > \\"With a harsh voice he (Duke William) called to Eustace of Boulogne, who > with 50 knights was turning in flight and was about to give the signal for > retreat.

Land holdings in England and Wales Turstin was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as holding many manors,http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk many of them presumably grants for loyal service to William of Normandy. He appears to have been the first holder of the extensive Barony of North Cadbury, Somerset, which included several manors in nearby counties. In particular, the Domesday Book of 1086 also recorded Turstin holding a small colony of eight carucates of land (about 1.5 square miles) in the jurisdiction of Caerleon seemingly just within the welsh Lordship of Gwynllwg held by Owain ap Caradog, son of Caradog ap Gruffydd and ancestor of the welsh Lords of CaerleonJermyn, Anthony. \\"4: Caerleon Through the Centuries to the Year 2000 \\". 2010 Accessed 13 Feb 2013.. Caerleon Castle was a Motte and Bailey Norman-style castle erected by the Welsh lords and/or Norman invaders on the western bank of the River Usk at the edge of the site of a Roman castle known as Ischia (Isca Augusta), which formed the southern end of the early western border of England with Wales. There were 2 serfs and one plough within the demesne lands. Also listed on the manor were three Welshmen with as many ploughs and carucates, who continued their Welsh customs (leges Walensi viventes). The manor was valued at 40 shillings. Turstin did not hold the land directly from the king, but from William de Scohies (or de Ecouis), a magnate of unknown antecedents with lands in Hereford and the Marches, Norfolk and in several other counties. Caerleon itself may have remained in welsh hands, or changed hands frequently. Turstin also held some property in Chepstow, just east of Caerleon, and the important crossing to Aust in Gloucestershire on the opposite east bank of the River Severn estuary. =From the King= ;Gloucestershire: *Alvington, Gloucestershire (Alwintune) *Ampney Crucis, Gloucestershire (Omenel).

The caput of his feudal honour was at Crendon, Buckinghamshire. *Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire Succession Clearly Turstin had \\"kindred\\" and \\"heirs\\" as referred to by Wace, yet these may have been in Normandy only, since no record of any familial inheritance exists for his English holdings. Turstin is said by some sources to have had a son named Ralph (FitzTurstin) who went on crusade to the Holy Land, where he died. Most of Turstin's lands, which later constituted a feudal barony, did not pass to his son, if indeed such existed, but to another apparently unrelated Norman magnate Wynebald de Ballon, who served for a time as seneschal of Caerleon Castle, whilst his elder brother Hamelin de Ballon had founded Abergavenny Castle 15 miles higher up the River Usk, and founded a barony seated at Much Marcle, i.e. next to, and possibly subsuming, Turstin's own manor of Little Marcle. Wynebald also inherited, almost intact, the lands comprising Turstin's fief, which is known collectively as the barony of North Cadbury. The reason for this transfer is not clear, whether by death or by his having fallen out of royal favour. It is possible that Turstin was a supporter of Duke Robert of Normandy, the Conqueror's eldest son who tried to wrest the kingdom of England from William Rufus, his younger brother who had had himself crowned very rapidly at Westminster following the Conqueror's death. Turstin would therefore have found himself on the losing side, and as is known to have happened to others in that situation, would have forfeited his lands. Such banishment is known to have been the fate of Turstin's other two neighbours at Oakley in Gloucestershire, Gislebert FitzTurold and Roger de Lacy, both banished from the kingdom in 1088.

Background This is Chiang's first novella to be published originally in hardcover. As of December 22, 2010, both the first edition and trade edition have sold out, but the novella remains available in second printing from Subterranean Press's website. The tale was later included in Chiang's second collection book Exhalation: Stories released in 2019. The Subterreanean Press edition of the novella features ten internal paintings and cover art by Weta Workshop artist Christian Pearce. Each of the novella's ten chapters is preceded by a map designed by Jacob McMurray. Story \\"The Lifecycle of Software Objects\\" follows Ana Alvarado over a twenty-year period, during which she \\"raises\\" an artificial intelligence from what is essentially a digital pet to a human- equivalent mind. Ana, a former zoo trainer, is hired by software developing company Blue Gamma to assist in the training of digital creatures, named digients in the story, that are designed with a learning capacity similar to human children. Ana helps with the training and forms a close bond with Derek Brooks, a designer in charge of creating the visual appearance of the digients. Blue Gamma releases the digients in a virtual reality platform named Data Earth with big initial success, but after several years, the popularity of the digients diminishes and Blue Gamma closes. Several of the employees form a group to keep the digients active and learning; Ana keeps one named Jax and Derek keeps two named Marco and Polo. Over the course of several years, Derek develops unrequited feelings for Ana. After a few more years, the Data Earth platform closes and merges with another digital platform named Real Space. Most of the games and software have already an equivalent there, but since Blue Gamma closed before the launching of Real Space, the digients code is not ported over and they remain isolated at private servers running a copy of Data Earth. Ana, Derek and the other owners maintain a flow of learning activities for the digients, but they are unable to provide enough social interaction for them unless they can port them to Real Space. This isolation frustrates the digients and limits their ability to continue developing as social beings. Ana receives an offer from another digient manufacturer to train their digients to become personal assistants. She considers it an opportunity to convince them to invest on the digients she has been training, but the job offer requires getting her brain chemistry altered to reinforce her commitment to her work. Around the same time, the group receives an offer by a marketer of virtual sex dolls, that offers to pay for the port of the digients to Real Space in exchange for copies of the digients to train as sex partners for their clients. Derek's digients Marco and Polo are intrigued by the offer, but Ana takes a strong position against it and instead prepares to accept her job offer. Upon learning that, Derek lets Marco convince him to accept the offer of the sex doll company and sells them a copy of Marco, even if he knows that this will destroy any chance he has with Ana. Ana finds out and has an awkward phone call with Derek. In the final scene, she is working on the education of Jax and meditates on the possibilities he will have at life, although she can't help feeling down because of the high price that was paid.

B. McDowell, or simply \\"the Major\\", (18 May 1923 ‚Äì 9 September 2009) was a British Army officer and subsequently chief executive of The Irish Times for nearly 40 years. Early life Born in Belfast in 1923, the only child of a Protestant and unionist couple, McDowell finished school at the Royal Belfast Academic Institution in 1941 as the second World War was under way. He was dissuaded from enlisting immediately in the British army by his parents: his father, also Thomas, had been gassed in the first World War and suffered serious lung problems which led to his early death in 1944. The young Tom went instead to Queen's University in Belfast to study commerce but, a year later and still uncertain about his long-term plans, he joined the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, being commissioned in 1943. He went on to join the Royal Ulster Rifles. A knee injury during a night training exercise in Omagh made him ineligible for active military service and he became a weapons instructor. The accident also led to him meeting his future wife, Margaret Telfer, the physiotherapist who treated him in hospital in Bangor, Co Down. He rose to the rank of major and was part of the Allied forces in occupied Austria following the end of the war, taking part in joint patrols in Vienna with Russian, American and French officers. In the post-war period, he was given two years to finish his college course and spent a summer studying law with a tutor before passing the English bar and returning to the British army. After a further military posting to Edinburgh, his legal qualification brought him to the army legal service in the War Office in London. With little prospect of further promotion and every chance of being posted abroad without his young family, he decided to leave the army. He was offered a job as legal adviser in London to James North Ltd, a company which made protective clothing; with no experience of industry, he asked to be given a managerial role at first. The company suggested a managing position in its operations in Dublin. He slotted easily into the city's old business establishment, joining the Kildare Street club, becoming a director of Pim's department store, and setting his career firmly on a commercial rather than a legal path. The Irish Times His involvement with newspapers came about through the recognition of his business acumen. He was asked by some acquaintances to take a look at the financial troubles of the Evening Mail, which was bought subsequently by The Irish Times, adding to the latter's own financial difficulties. He was asked later by The Irish Times to see if Roy Thomson, the Canadian-born British press baron whom he had met while they both looked separately at the Evening Mail, might be interested in taking it over. Thomson passed and the company then asked McDowell himself to take charge as chief executive in 1962. Among his first actions were to close the Evening Mail and the Sunday Review, a short-lived tabloid that was ahead of its time. A year later, another problem was resolved when Douglas Gageby, who had been hired as managing director of The Irish Times shortly before McDowell's arrival, took over as editor. Relationship with Douglas Gageby Thus, what had begun as a slightly awkward relationship, turned into a highly successful partnership as Gageby set about broadening the newspaper's editorial appeal and McDowell set it on a successful commercial course. McDowell always credited Gageby and his successors as editor with the success of the newspaper, pointing out in an interview last year for the newspaper's archives that \\"people buy the paper to see what the editor has said, not to know how it is printed or what kind of paper is used\\". Although he had a close relationship with editors, especially Gageby, he did not interfere in the editorial running of the newspaper. He did not share Gageby's republicanism but believed that the minority in the North had been treated badly by the majority. When the North erupted in violence in 1969 - a time when there was little or no real communication between nationalists and unionists or between Irish and British politicians and bureaucrats - he tried on his own initiative to interest the then British prime minister, Harold Wilson, in talks with all the other parties involved. His efforts came to nothing but irritated the then British ambassador to Dublin, Sir Andrew Gilchrist, whom he had bypassed. In a briefing letter about McDowell's approach, Gilchrist wrote that McDowell had described Gageby as \\"a renegade or white nigger\\". McDowell strongly denied the charge when Gilchrist's letter was published in 2003: \\"I never used that phrase, nor would I have thought of using it, about Gageby,\\" he said in last year's interview. \\"Other people (in Belfast) called him a renegade, but I never thought he was a renegade. Douglas never made any secret of what he was. There could be no doubt about him turning or changing or anything like that.\\" The Irish Times Trust By the early 1970s, the circulation of The Irish Times had almost doubled in a decade to 60,000 and it was making money. Some of the directors indicated an interest in selling the company and McDowell proposed instead that it be turned into a trust. It was a period when several newspapers in Ireland and Britain had changed hands or were seen as being vulnerable to takeovers. His aims were to protect the newspaper's independence, make it as difficult as possible for anyone to take over, and formalise its aims in a guiding trust. McDowell's primary interest in the arrangements was in drawing up the terms of the trust, using his legal expertise and drawing on a wide range of media models including the Guardian, the Observer, the Economist magazine, and the New York Times as well as other documents ranging from the Constitution to the American Declaration of Independence. He worked on the trust document for many months, going through 28 drafts before he was satisfied with the result. Among the issues he had to consider was the mechanism for appointing trustees: various options which would allow public bodies or interests to name members were considered but ruled out because of fears that the appointments would become politicised. In the end, he opted to appoint them himself, with the help of each one selected to appoint others. When he had finished the draft trust document he showed it to Gageby who suggested that a proviso requiring the newspaper to reflect minority views be included, which it was. The five directors of the company, including McDowell and Gageby, transferred their shares in the company to a solicitor in the autumn of 1973 in anticipation of announcing the trust at the end of that year. Further delays in finalising the trust terms resulted in its announcement in April 1974, on the eve of the introduction of capital gains tax. The timing gave rise to suggestions that the directors were taking their cash (¬£325,000 each) out of the company before the new tax took effect. McDowell always denied that this was the case, maintaining that the timing was coincidental: he was also adamant that the motivation behind the formation of the trust itself was altruistic. The formation of the trust left the newspaper with a large bank debt, used to buy out the directors/shareholders, at what turned out to be a difficult economic period after the first oil crisis hit the western world in the autumn of 1974. McDowell successfully guided The Irish Times' financial fortunes through the subsequent recession and into further periods of growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He stood down as chief executive of the company in 1997 and retired from the chairmanship of The Irish Times Trust in 2001: he was given the title President for Life in recognition of his huge contribution to the newspaper. Tom McDowell was a private person and never sought or exploited the public status or limelight that goes with being a newspaper publisher. But he was an extraordinary presence in \\"the bunker\\", his office in D'Olier Street. He always dressed formally and though he was somewhat aloof, he knew every employee. During his visit to the new The Irish Times offices on Tara Street, in June 2008 for the unveiling of a portrait of him by Andrew Festing, he described the newspaper and his family as the two loves of his life. Personal life His wife, Margaret, predeceased him in 1992. At the time of his death he was survived by his daughters Penelope and Karen, sons-in-law, five grandchildren and four great grandchildren.

The most notable of Stereotaxis‚Äô products is the NIOBE¬Æ ES Remote Magnetic Navigation (RMN) System. With first iterations of the RMN system originally designed for applications within the brain, its current usage is guiding magnetic catheters during electrophysiology studies and catheter ablation procedures to treat arrhythmias within in the heart. The technology has been approved by regulatory agencies in the United States, European Union and other countries around the world. Systems operate within cardiac catheter labs in hospitals and have been utilized in over 100,000 procedures worldwide as of 2017.  System Overview  The NIOBE¬Æ ES Magnetic Navigation System includes two NIOBE¬Æ pods which utilize permanent magnets mounted on pivoting arms and positioned on opposing sides of the operating table. The magnets are controlled by physicians from outside of the procedure room by interacting with the NAVIGANT‚Ñ¢ software using a mouse, keyboard, joystick, and ODYSSEY¬Æ viewing screen. The rotation of the magnets within the Niobe pods influences the magnetic catheters in the heart to make micro movements of the catheter tip (in increments of 1 mm to 9 mm) to navigate throughout the four chambers of the heart and complete the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. This process differs from traditional non- robotic procedures where an electrophysiologist stands within the x-ray fluoroscopy field at patient bedside and manipulates a pull-wire catheter by making very fine movements of his or her fingers and wrists at the catheter base. This force is then transferred over the entire length until it reaches the tip of the catheter within the patient‚Äôs heart.

Both players were selected first overall by the San Antonio Spurs in their draft years with Robinson's selection coming in the 1987 NBA draft and Duncan's selection coming ten years later and both played their entire careers with the San Antonio Spurs. Players =Tim Duncan= Prior to being selected number one overall by the Spurs in the 1997 NBA Draft, Tim Duncan played at Wake Forest for four years. Despite many speculations that Duncan would go pro early and would be the number one pick if he did so, he would not go pro until he graduated from college and played all four of his years with Wake Forest.Tim Duncan Biography, jockbio.com. Retrieved April 19, 2007. Despite never making the Final Four, Duncan's college career at Wake Forest was considered to be a success. In his sophomore season, Duncan led Wake Forest to a win over a Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina squad in the ACC Championship Game and would also lead Wake Forest to a #1 seed in the 1995 NCAA Tournament and a trip to the Sweet 16, but despite Duncan's 12 points and 22 rebounds in their Sweet 16 game, Wake Forest would lose to Oklahoma State 71‚Äì66 in the Sweet 16. Duncan would be named to the All-ACC 1st team that season. Duncan's leadership at Wake Forest stepped up in his junior year as Wake Forest lost his teammate Randolph Childress to graduation and selection in the 1995 NBA draft. Despite playing on an inexperienced squad, Duncan would lead Wake Forest to a 26‚Äì6 record, including a 12‚Äì4 record in ACC play, a second consecutive ACC Tournament Championship, and a trip to the NCAA Elite Eight, where despite 14 points, 16 rebounds, and six assists from Duncan, Wake Forest would fall to eventual national champion Kentucky 83‚Äì64. Duncan would be named ACC Defensive Player of the Year and ACC Player of the Year for a remarkable season with Wake Forest. Despite a disappointing senior season losing in the semifinals of the ACC Tournament and getting beat by Stanford in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, Duncan had an impressive year that season as he won numerous national player of the year awards, including being a unanimous pick for the Oscar Robertson Trophy and the Naismith Award, and was voted ACC Player of the Year again. =David Robinson= David Robinson played four years of college basketball at Navy prior to being selected first overall in 1987 by the Spurs. Robinson began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA, but like Duncan, won numerous national player of the year awards in his senior season. Robinson led Navy to the Elite Eight in the 1986 NCAA Tournament as a #7 regional seed. Robinson was selected as the #1 overall pick in the 1987 NBA Draft, but had to wait two years to join the Spurs because of his active-duty obligation with the Navy. Prior to Robinson's arrival, the Spurs were one of the worst teams in the NBA as they were just coming off of a 21-61 record. Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single season turnaround in NBA history at the time in his rookie season, as he led the Spurs to a 56-26 record and to the second round of the NBA Playoffs where they would lose to the eventual Western Conference champions Portland Trail Blazers in seven games.NBA.com: David Robinson Bio Robinson would be unanimously named the NBA rookie of the year that season. Robinson's success would continue on as he was named NBA MVP in 1995 and one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, and he would lead the Spurs to the playoffs in each of the next six seasons, but he would only lead the Spurs to the Western Conference finals once in that span, where he would go head-to-head against chief rival Hakeem Olajuwon as the Spurs would fall to the Houston Rockets in six games. The 1996‚Äì97 season was a particularly frustrating season for the Spurs as Robinson would hurt his back in preseason play and would not return until December, and six games after he finally returned, he suffered a season-ending injury as he broke his foot. As a result, the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20-62 record. \\"Twin Towers\\" era After having the third-worst record in the 1996‚Äì97 season, the San Antonio Spurs won the NBA Draft lottery, giving them the #1 pick in the 1997 NBA draft. With the #1 pick in the 1997 NBA draft, they drafted Tim Duncan. Duncan quickly became a dominant force in the NBA as he was named to the All-NBA First Team in his rookie season as well as being selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game in his rookie season and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for that year. Like Robinson, Duncan led the Spurs to another turnaround as he led the Spurs to a 56-26 record and qualification for the 1998 NBA Playoffs, which is the first of what would become a 21-year playoff streak for the San Antonio Spurs, which would last Tim Duncan's entire career with the Spurs. In Duncan's playoff debut, he has a bad first half and with the Spurs trailing the Phoenix Suns 50-45 at halftime, Suns coach Danny Ainge decided to put less defensive pressure on Duncan, and as a result, would finish Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds as the Spurs would emerge with a 102-96 victory in Game 1..

This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached, resulting in a shortened 50-game season.

The \\"Twin Towers\\" would lead the San Antonio Spurs to another Midwest Division title the following season, this time finishing as the #2 seed in the Western Conference. The Spurs would end up beating the Seattle SuperSonics in five games in the first round (note: prior to the 2002‚Äì03 NBA season, all first round series were best-of-five series). In the conference semifinals series against the Los Angeles Lakers, the Spurs would take a lead going into the fourth quarter in all five games as Duncan had steady production in this series with a double-double in every game, but the Spurs were unable to hold off Kobe Bryant's fourth quarter heroics and were only able to win one game in that series as a result. After posting 34 points and 25 rebounds in Game 5, Duncan stated his frustration: \\"I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes.\\" Also, Robinson said \\"Tim [Duncan] was like Superman out there\\", and conceded that the Lakers were simply better, just like in the last playoffs campaign. Tim Duncan would be named the NBA MVP for the 2001‚Äì02 season.

The Spurs got past the Suns in a six-game series. In the conference semifinals against the Lakers, Tim Duncan was matched up against eventual teammate Robert Horry, and would dominate him the entire series. In Game 6 of the series, Duncan had 37 points and 16 rebounds to close out the series with a 110-82 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, avenging their last two playoff losses to the Los Angeles Lakers. After the series, Spurs head coach Greg Popovich stated: \\"I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [Duncan] was astounding in his focus.

Johns was originally a miner; he came to Isle Royale to work the Windigo Mine, and later the Minong Mine (in 1881-1883). When the Windigo failed, Johns turned to fishing to make a living, homesteading on some of the islands of Washington Harbor, including both Johns Island and Barnum Island where the hotel is now located. In the late 19th century, there was an upsurge of interest in recreation in the Isle Royale area, leading some inhabitants to supplement their income by working as hunting or fishing guides. In 1892, Captain John F. Johns and his wife Catherine opened the Johns Hotel. The hotel was the first summer resort and first U.S. Postal Office on Isle Royale. In addition, the site served as the base for the Johns family's commercial fishing business. By 1902, there were 16 buildings on this site, including a hotel, dining room, store, barn, three fish houses, warehouse, five cottages of various sizes, root house, and two docks. Duluth, Minnesota businessman George Barnum began vacationing at the Johns Hotel in the 1890s. Enamored of the area, he bought the island from the Johns family in 1902 and renamed it Barnum Island. Barnum turned the island into a private resort, inviting his friends to build cabins on the island. The site today Two buildings, the hotel and one cottage, remain on the site; the remainder were either dismantled or burned, but some archaeological features remain. The main Johns Hotel is a 1-1/2 story structure built of round logs with cement chinking. It was originally a single story building; the upper portion was added later. It has six rooms and a gabled roof with vertical board gable ends, and six-light and six-over-six horizontal sliding windows. A single-story addition with shed roof is located to the rear. The cottage is a 1-1/2 story building built with round logs with cement chinking. It has a gabled roof with shingled gable ends, and 6-over-6 windows.

He died following an automobile accident in California.In Memoriam: Gavin Trippe Snr, racing pioneer Bikesport News, 6 July 2018. Retrieved 19 July 2018 Trippe was a motorcycling journalist in the UK until he founded a motorcycling magazine, Motor Cycle Weekly, in the United States in 1969. In the early 1970s he brought European style motocross racing to the US by founding the Carlsbad USGP. Trippe is also the creator of supermoto racing, which attracted a large US television audience from 1979‚Äì1985, and had a resurgence, first in Europe and then beyond, since the early 2000s. Since 2007 Trippe worked to create a single cylinder racing class with low barriers to entry for amateur racers and young riders. Publications After working for the British publication Motor Cycle News, he co-founded, with Bruce Cox, Motor Cycle Weekly in America in 1969. Motor Cycle Weekly ceased publication in 1975. He wrote \\"The Spoken Wheel\\" column for the online publication Motorcycle USA. Race classes Trippe started the Carlsbad United States Grand Prix in 1973, and invented supermoto in 1979. Trippe also helped create the AMA Superbike Championship in 1976. Other events Trippe promoted included the Trans-AMA motocross series, the Trans-Atlantic Match Races, and Ascot half- mile dirt track racing. In 2007 he proposed a new American single cylinder class based on the success of European supermono. =Carlsbad United States Grand Prix= Trippe introduced European-style 500 cc motocross racing to the US in the early 1970s, creating an event at Carlsbad, California which grew into a major international venue. The 1971 motocross race at Carlsbad Raceway attracted 21,000 spectators and 15 million television viewers. In 1973, his company, Trippe-Cox Associates, secured the sponsorship of leisure apparel maker Hang Ten International, and the event became the Hang Ten Carlsbad United States Grand Prix (USGP), run under the auspices of the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA), and sanctioned as a Grand Prix event by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). It was the 7th round of the 1973 Trans-AMA, the only US event at the time to pay points in the FIM World 500 cc Championship. For the race, Trippe-Cox Associates made improvements to the Carlsbad facility, including new water sprinklers, fencing, spectator bridges and billboards. The series proved commercially successful, with a significant television audience. For second year of the event, 1974, the course was lengthened by ¬º mile, to , with the new section having a left turning uphill corner followed by a sharp right turn into a ravine. The 1974 purse grew to US$30,000, and 60 riders from 13 countries competed in the race, by then the eighth stop on the race circuit earning points to the 500 cc championship. Carlsbad was the oldest venue of the US motocross season's main events until the last USGP there in 1986. Motocross popularity declined in the 90s, and by 1995 there was no motocross Grand Prix in the US, until the FIM championship returned in 2010. In 1984 Trippe began to worry that development was encroaching on Carlsbad Raceway, and that the site would be sold when his lease expired. =Supermoto= The transition from dirt to pavement at a supermoto event at EICMA Trippe was the inventor and early promoter of supermoto, which combines on a single course three genres of motorcycle racing: the hard-packed, flat dirt of track racing, the uneven obstacles and jumps of motocross, and the high speed straights and turns of paved road racing. The original purpose was to find out who was the best overall motorcycle racer from the three disciplines. Trippe built first course at Carlsbad Raceway. The machines are motocross-style motorcycles, but with smoother, road race style tires, though in the beginning 750 cc Harley- Davidson flat trackers competed as well. The seed of the idea for Superbikers began was when reporter Bob Iger asked Trippe at a motocross event why Kenny Roberts wasn't competing, and Trippe replied, puzzled, \\"Because he is a road racer.\\" Trippe began thinking that, \\"The huge mass doesn't know the difference between dirt track, motocross and road racing.\\" The ten best riders from each discipline, motocross, dirt track and road racing, would be race together because, \\"All these riders know one another and respect one another, but they never race one another. This is a way we can pitch them all in together. We've tried to lay out a course where all branches will be competitive,\\" said Trippe. Motocross riders won five of the first six Superbikers championships, promoting Trippe to consider changing the course to have less off-road and more paved stretches to give the track and the road riders a better shot. He trademarked it as \\"Superbikers\\" and was one of the original promoters of the Superbikers segment on ABC's Wide World of Sports from 1979‚Äì1985. Besides combining road racing with dirt racing, Superbikers brought together top riders from different specialties, like an all-star game. After the end of Superbikers television run, supermoto declined in the US but grew in Europe, until 2003 when AMA Pro Racing began a supermoto championship. =Formula 450 series= Trippe proposed the creation of a new US single cylinder road racing class based on repurposed motocross bikes. It was to be called \\"Super Single\\" but later the proposed name was changed to Formula 450, or F450. Trippe had been lobbying for the creation of a Formula 450 class because it would be more affordable to rookie and under-21-year-old riders, compared to 600 cc supersport sport bike racing. He said, \\"Formula 450 is a great way to encourage young riders. It's back-to-basics racing, emphasizing riding skill over horsepower, and you don't need a six-figure sponsorship just to make the grid.\\" One reviewer described the machines as, \\"a single cylinder 450 cc dirt bike that's been converted into an entry-level road racer. The frame, subframe, swing arm, motor and transmission are all stock, but the wheels, tires, suspension and bodywork have all been modified for on-track use and general skulduggery.\\" After a few years of development and testing, Formula 450s became motocross bikes which had been converted to road racing by installing 17-inch wheels, larger front brakes, clip on handlebars and aerodynamic fairings. Replacing the forks with parts from supersport sport bikes was unsuccessful because the forks were too short, leading to too little trail. Instead the stock motocross front and rear suspension components were kept, but reconfigured. According to Trippe, the cost of preparing such a bike was under US$10,000 and tires last three race weekends, longer than a 600 cc class supersport. For the 2009 season, the United States Grand Prix Racers Union (USGPRU) club-level racing organisation added a Formula 450 class on a trial basis to five of their rounds, to test the prototype motorcycles and gauge interest in adding the class. The USGPRU also published a detailed technical account of how to build Formula 450 racer from a donor motocross bike. Formula 450 was not run in 2010 or scheduled for 2011. Inspired by Trippe's development and promotion of this idea, the AMA announced in July 2009 there would be a single cylinder series to be called Formula 450, but as a spec series, with identical bikes built, owned, and maintained by single manufacturer provided to all riders, rather than bikes adapted by riders from motocross bikes. Two months later, AMA Pro Road Racing announced that the new class would be called GT3, an expansion of the SunTrust Moto-GT.

The plant at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s employed more than 6,000 people who worked on repairing the entire fleet of Trans World Airlines (and other airlines under contract) and it was Kansas City's biggest employer. Since TWA's successor American Airlines began downsizing in preparation for a total abandonment effective September 2010, three companies moved their headquarters and plants into the complex (Smith Electric Vehicles (US), Jet Midwest and Nordic Windpower). Frontier Airlines leased two narrow-body hangars. The plant along with the airport opened in 1957 at a cost of $25 million and was marked an attempt to keep TWA in Kansas City following the Great Flood of 1951 which had destroyed TWA's facilities at Fairfax Airport close to the Missouri River. TWA's plant had been in the former North American Aviation B-25 Mitchell bomber plant at Fairfax. TWA labeled the building MCIE (after the airport's original name of Mid-Continent International Airport). The airline also moved its large overhaul operations at the New Castle County Airport in Delaware to Kansas City. In 1973, when the airport opened to replace Kansas City Downtown Airport as the city's main airport, TWA also added its distinctive sloped wide-body hangars.

It is closely related to the task of document structuring. Example Consider an NLG system which summarises information about sick babies. Suppose this system has four pieces of information it can communicate # The baby is being given morphine via an IV drop # The baby's heart rate shows bradycardia's (temporary drops) # The baby's temperature is normal # The baby is crying Which of these bits of information should be included in the generated texts? Issues There are three general issues which almost always impact the content determination task, and can be illustrated with the above example. Perhaps the most fundamental issue is the communicative goal of the text, i.e. its purpose and reader. In the above example, for instance, a doctor who wants to make a decision about medical treatment would probably be most interested in the heart rate bradycardias, while a parent who wanted to know how her child was doing would probably be more interested in the fact that the baby was being given morphine and was crying. The second issue is the size and level of detail of the generated text. For instance, a short summary which was sent to a doctor as a 160 character SMS text message might only mention the heart rate bradycarias, while a longer summary which was printed out as a multipage document might also mention the fact that the baby is on a morphine IV. The final issue is how unusual and unexpected the information is. For example, neither doctors nor parents would place a high priority on being told that the baby's temperature was normal, if they expected this to be the case. Regardless, content determination is very important to users, indeed in many cases the quality of content determination is the most important factor (from the user's perspective) in determining the overall quality of the generated text. Techniques There are three basic approaches to document structuring: schemas (content templates), statistical approaches, and explicit reasoning. Schemas K McKeown (1985). Text Generation. Cambridge University Press are templates which explicitly specify the content of a generated text (as well as document structuring information). Typically they are constructed by manually analysing a corpus of human-written texts in the target genre, and extracting a content template from these texts. Schemas work well in practice in domains where content is somewhat standardised, but work less well in domains where content is more fluid (such as the medical example above). Statistical techniques use statistical corpus analysis techniques to automatically determine the content of the generated texts. Such work is in its infancy, and has mostly been applied to contexts where the communicative goal, reader, size, and level of detail are fixed. For example, generation of newswire summaries of sporting events.R Barzilay and M Lapata (2005). Collective content selection for concept-to-text generation. Proceedings of EMNLP-2005 R Perera and P Nand (2014). The Role of Linked Data in Content Selection. Proceedings of PRICAI-2014 Explicit reasoning approaches have probably attracted the most attention from researchers. The basic idea is to use AI reasoning techniques (such as knowledge-based rules, planning,J Moore and C Paris (1993). Planning Text for Advisory Dialogues: Capturing Intentional and Rhetorical Information Using. Computational Linguistics 19:651-694 pattern detection,J Yu, E Reiter, J Hunter, C Mellish (2007).

Knowledge-Based Systems 18:235-242 etc.) to examine the information available to be communicated (including how unusual/unexpected it is), the communicative goal and reader, and the characteristics of the generated text (including target size), and decide on the optimal content for the generated text. A very wide range of techniques has been explored, but there is no consensus as to which is most effective.

A simple building originally home to a wealthy farmer, it was passed down through numerous generations of the original owner's family, and it has been named a historic site. Born at Lippitt, Rhode Island in 1819, Henry J. Young came to present-day Noble County with his family in 1825. Although the land was then in a wild state, he carefully acquired enough money to buy of land and marry a woman from Pennsylvania, and he moved to the site of the present house in Center Township in 1846.History of Noble County, Ohio with Portraits and Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Pioneers and Prominent Men. Chicago: Watkins, 1887. Center Township farmers had been growing tobacco since circa 1835, and war conditions only heightened demand for the township's leaf. Tobacco commerce was centered in the community of Sarahsville, which remained active in the trade into the late 1880s. In such a context Young began growing and dealing in tobacco, and by the 1880s, he had made himself one of the county's wealthiest men. In addition to his commercial activities, he was a community pioneer; he was among the founders of the Fredericksdale United Brethren Church,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1122-1123. although for much of his life he was a member of and a lay preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church. After nearly a quarter of a century in their original farmhouse, Young and his wife arranged for the present house to be erected in 1870, hiring contractor Tobias Shaw of Senecaville to oversee construction; Shaw's son ultimately married Young's daughter, and the property has remained in Shaw ownership through several generations of the family. Two and a half stories tall, the house is a wooden balloon framed building covered with weatherboarding. The front is divided into five bays with a doorway in the center of the first story, while the largely windowless ends rise to gables. Chimneys pierce the slate roof at either end of the roofline, and the entire structure rests on a stone foundation., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2014-02-19. In 1980, the Young-Shaw House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it qualified because of its connection to Henry Young and his prominent place in the history of the area. Five agricultural outbuildings were included in the historic designation, which is one of nine such locations in Noble County. The house was torn down in 2016 by the family. It was too expensive to maintain and posed a danger to the public. The usable wood from the house was reclaimed and donated.

Built about 1820, it is a prominent local example of Federal period architecture, whose occupants have included prominent local businessmen and one Governor of Connecticut. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Augustus Post House is located in the village of Hebron, at the southeast corner of Main and Church Streets. It faces north toward a surviving segment of Hebron's village green. It is a 2-1/2 story brick house, four bays wide, with a front gable roof and four chimneys. The main facade has windows in each bay, with then main entrance sandwiched between the center two bays. It is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a semi-elliptical fanlight window. A wood frame ell extends to the building's rear. The interior has retained significant original handiwork despite its adaptation for use as professional offices. and Built c. 1820, it is locally significant as a fine example of vernacular Federal style architecture. The Augustus Post for whom it is named was Capt. Ezekiel Augustus Post (1775-1854) who fought as part of the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia in the war of 1812. Post, a craftsman, married three times and had a total of seventeen children, fourteen of whom survived into adulthood and three of whom bore the name Augustus. He was also grandfather to Augustus Post the aviation and automotive pioneer who founded the American Automobile Association. Capt. Post may have overextended himself in the construction of the house. He sold it in 1824 to the mortgage holder, a local merchant. The house went through a significant number of owners in the 19th century, one of whom was John S. Peters, a businessman who served as Governor of Connecticut 1831-33. From the late 19th century to the 1970s it was owned by the Hewitt family, who operated a nearby general store.

The engine is a 4-6-2 heavy \\"Pacific\\" type steam locomotive, remarkably similar to Southern Railway's Ps-4 class. With sister locomotive No. 190 built for the Western Railway of Alabama, the 290 pulled the Crescent passenger train from Atlanta, Georgia to Montgomery, Alabama until the engine's retirement from revenue- producing service in 1954.  History  290 entered service for the West Point Route in 1926, pulling the Crescent from Atlanta, Georgia, to Montgomery, Alabama. When the locomotive was taken out of service in 1954, fans of 290 established the \\"290 Club\\" which succeeded in persuading the Atlanta and West Point Railroad to preserve the locomotive rather than sell it for scrap. 290 remained on static display for several years before it was donated to the Atlanta Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society in 1961.  Restoration  In the late 1980s, the New Georgia Railroad, an Atlanta-based steam excursion railroad, needed another locomotive and 290 was quickly restored. Under steam again for the first time in 1989, 290 pulled regular excursions in the Atlanta vicinity and made several longer excursions to other cities including a historic trip to Montgomery in 1992. In 1991, 290 traveled to Norfolk Southern Norris Yard Steam Shop in Irondale, Alabama, for running-gear maintenance work to resolve hot-running bearings. Work was largely done by New Georgia Railroad personnel led by mechanic/engineer Bill Magee(GBA Director-New Georgia Railroad), utilizing Norfolk Southern's shop equipment. Shortly thereafter, the New Georgia Railroad stopped operating steam locomotives when the state government discontinued its funding. 290 operated for the last time under steam in 1995. As of 2017, 290 was undergoing preservation at the Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Georgia. There have been no legitimate opportunities to operate the locomotive in such a manner that justifies restoring her to operation. Therefore, she will be placed on display until such an opportunity presents itself.  Legacy  The locomotive was the subject of Pentrex's New Georgia Steam Excursions: A&WP; #290, a film appealing to railfans covering a ceremonial run between Atlanta and Montgomery over 290's home rails. The engine itself also made a cameo appearance in the motion picture Fried Green Tomatoes and in the 1995 television film The Tuskegee Airmen as fictional railway Tallahassee & Albany #290.

It is intended to chart the relative strength or weakness of a trading vehicle based on the comparison of the recent price changes and the overall price changes for the period. The REI can be classified as a momentum oscillator, measuring the velocity and magnitude of directional price movements. The REI shows overbought/oversold price conditions by measuring the relation between the sum of \\"strong\\" price changes (such that form a trend) and all price changes for the period. The REI is most typically used on an 8 day timeframe. It changes on a scale from ‚àí100 to +100, with the overbought and oversold levels marked at +60 and ‚àí60, respectively. The range expansion index was developed by Thomas DeMark and published in his 1994 book, The New Science of Technical Analysis.Thomas R. DeMark, The New Science of Technical Analysis, Calculation Two sums are calculated for each day. One is the conditional sum of the \\"strong\\" price changes: : S1 = sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j m_j s_j where k is the period of calculation (usually, 8), n_j is a first condition: \`if ((High[j ‚Äì 2] < Close[j - 7]) && (High[j - 2] < Close[j - 8]) && (High[j] < High[j - 5]) && (High[j] < High[j - 6])) n_j = 0 else n_j = 1\` m_j is a second condition: \`if ((Low[j ‚Äì 2] > Close[j ‚Äì 7]) && (Low[j ‚Äì 2] > Close[j ‚Äì 8]) && (Low[j] > Low[j ‚Äì 5]) && (Low[j] > Low[j ‚Äì 6])) m_j = 0 else m_j = 1\` and s_j is the price change parameter: : s_j = High[j] - High[j - 2] + Low[j] - Low[j - 2],! The second sum is calculated as following: : S2 = sum_{j=1}^{k} High[j] - High[j - 2] + Low[j] - Low[j - 2] For each trading day the value of the indicator is calculated: : REI = frac{S1}{S2} 100 Interpretation According to Thomas DeMark, price weakness is shown by the indicator when its value rises above level 60 and then declines below it.

History The site of Pyla-Kokkinokremos, located on a rocky plateau, lies about 10 km east of Larnaca, ancient Kition, and some 20 km southwest of Enkomi, two major Bronze Age centres of the 13th-12th c. BC, the period known as Late Cypriot IIC and IIIA. The site was explored at previous occasions by P. Dikaios in 1952, by V. Karageorghis in 1981-1982 and, more recently, in 2010‚Äì2013, by V. Karageorghis and A. Kanta. Since 2014, the excavation is a joint venture between J. Bretschneider (UGhent), J. Driessen (UCLouvain) and A. Kanta (Mediterranean Archaeological Society). Based on the different explorations, it can be assumed that the entire plateau of ca. seven hectares was densely occupied. Most telling is the excavation of part of a regularly laid-out settlement in the eastern and north-western sector of which the outer perimeter ‚Äòcasemate‚Äô wall is assumed to have encircled the entire hill top plateau. The repetition of residential units within the excavated sectors appears to suggest that the establishment of the settlement was a deliberate and planned enterprise. Moreover, the discovery of material culture, including several hidden hoards of precious metals, seems to indicate the planned and organized abandonment of the settlement; since the inhabitants never retrieved these hoards, it is believed they were killed or enslaved. Former excavations have yielded two tablets inscribed in Cypro-Minoan and have confirmed the international character of its material culture, such as Minoan, Canaanite, Mycenaean, Sardinian, Hittite and Cypriot ceramics. The project aims to get a better understanding of the multicultural character of the site, especially against the background of the continuing discussion on migration, interaction and acculturation, which typifies the late 13th and early 12th c. BC in the Eastern Mediterranean. Pyla-Kokkinokremos was established at a time when the Late Bronze Age collapse reached its zenith, just a few decades prior to its eventual seemingly premeditated abandonment. While the settlement was never reoccupied and has a lifespan of less than fifty years, Pyla becomes a very valuable ‚Äòtime capsule‚Äô of the LC IIC-IIIA critical phase. Owing to these facts together with its ethnically amalgamated material, the archaeological data from Pyla-Kokkinokremos surface as an exceptional opportunity to address the Late Bronze Age collapse and international contacts in the Levantine and Eastern Mediterranean world.

The \\"Knowledge Quarter\\" in Liverpool, England is a modern term in business given to the vicinity of Liverpool city centre that focuses heavily on the education, knowledge and research sectors. Background Although an unofficial ensemble, the Knowledge Quarter is recognised by the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool City Council, the Northwest Regional Development Agency and Liverpool Vision ‚Äî all of which realise the importance of the area and its major role in the national and international knowledge sector. Various institutions have been sited within the current borders of the knowledge quarter for centuries, and many institutions are currently undergoing multimillion-pound redevelopment schemes to cement the knowledge quarter as the United Kingdom's most successful such location. The knowledge quarter generates around 15% of the entire city's GVA and is educating upwards of 60,000 individuals in all manner of disciplines. A special purpose vehicle, known as the Knowledge Quarter Development Company (KQDC) was set up in March 2018 to attract investment and oversee the expansion and development of the Knowledge Quarter's science and technology facilities. The KQDC is made up of partners from Liverpool City Council, the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University and hopes to attract investment up to ¬£100 million. The council announced in July 2018 that it had signed up three companies to oversee the creation of a Spatial Regeneration Framework for the Knowledge Quarter Gateway. GVA HOW Planning, K2 Architects and Planit-IE were tasked to look at how to best redevelop the areas around Lime Street Station & Central Station alongside plans by Liverpool John Moores University for new development of its Copperas Hill site. The report is hoped to be submitted in spring 2019. Location Map showing expanse of the knowledge quarter within Liverpool City Centre. Geographically, the Knowledge Quarter stretches from Upper Parliament Street in the south to Islington in the north and is bound by Grove Street and Low Hill to the east and Renshaw Street to the west. The knowledge quarter generates ¬£1 billion in income per year and supports some 14,000 full-time jobs. It is one of the greatest contributors to the economy of Liverpool. Liverpool Cathedral, Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, Philharmonic Hall and the World Museum are also located within the knowledge quarter. Since the early 2000s (decade), hundreds of millions have been invested in expanding and improving the knowledge quarter, the single largest redevelopment scheme is the ¬£451 million new Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Notable institutions =City of Liverpool College= City of Liverpool College is the only college of further education in the city, located on Myrtle Street was formed in 1991 by an amalgamation of four former colleges. Since 1999 over ¬£47 million has been invested in City of Liverpool College, which in 2005 was awarded Beacon College Status in recognition of its outstanding performance. Approximately 17,000 students are enrolled at the institution. =Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)= The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts is a performing arts higher education institution that was established in 1996 by Paul McCartney and Mark Featherstone-Witty. The university offers foundation certificate courses, undergraduate courses and performing arts classes for 4- to 19-year-olds. The main LIPA building is housed in the former Liverpool Institute High School for Boys. =Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU)= Liverpool John Moores University is the largest educational institute in the city by student population (with around 26,000 enrolled). LJMU was founded in 1825 as Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts, over the next century it merged with various other colleges to become Liverpool Polytechnic and in 1992 was granted university status as one of the United Kingdom's many 'new universities'. LJMU is arranged into six Faculties including Business and Law; Education, Community and Leisure; Health and Applied Social Sciences; Media, Arts and Social Science; Science and Technology and Environment. The majority of these faculties are located at the Byrom Street and Mount Pleasant campuses ‚Äì both of which are situated within the \\"Liverpool knowledge quarter\\". Mass regeneration of LJMU has occurred since the start of the 21st century, amongst some of the university's newest properties are the ¬£25 million Tom Reilly Building, the ¬£27 million Art and Design Academy and the ¬£37.6 million Clarence Street Building. In total, the university has invested some ¬£180 million in a 10-year campus development programme (2003 to 2013). =Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM)= The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine was founded in 1898 as the first such school of its kind in the world. The school has made many contributions to tropical medicine, most notably the identification of the vector for malaria by Ronald Ross (who eventually went on the win a Nobel Prize for his discovery). LSTM is now a registered charity affiliated to the University of Liverpool and offers numerous postgraduate courses and diplomas. In 2005 Bill Gates donated ¬£28 million to LSTM which allowed for a new ¬£23 million state-of-the-art facility to be built adjoined to the original school. =Liverpool Science Park= left Liverpool Science Park was established in 2006 with the completion of the Innovation Centre 1 (ic1). Within its first year of existence, ic1 attracted over 50 new companies to the city, which further enhanced Liverpool's position as a leading centre of knowledge and enterprise. Nanotechnologies, healthcare, information technology, biotechnology, research and development into the automotive industry and specialist support services all have a strong presence at Liverpool Science Park which can be found between Mount Pleasant and Brownlow Hill. Since IC1 opened, a second building, IC2, has been added and in 2014 a large extension to IC1 opened containing 40,000 sq ft of commercial laboratory and office space. In total, the science park now provides 120,000 sq ft of high-specification grade A accommodation and laboratory space. =Liverpool Women's Hospital= The ¬£30 million NHS foundation trust Liverpool Women's Hospital was built in 1995 after the formation of The Liverpool Maternity Hospital, The Women's Hospital and Mill Road Hospital in 1985. Liverpool Women's is one of only two such hospitals in the United Kingdom, as well as being the largest hospital in Europe devoted entirely to women's health. Maternity services, gynaecology, gynaecologic oncology, neonatology, reproductive medicine and genetics services are all available at the hospital which is located in the very south-eastern corner of the Knowledge Quarter. =National Oceanography Centre= The National Oceanography Centre (formerly and still occasionally known as the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory) is located on Brownlow Street to the immediate north of Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral. The centre is a fully owned research laboratory of the Natural Environment Research Council, world class research takes places at the NOC in the form of studying oceanography covering global sea levels and geodesy, numerical modelling of continental shelf seas and coastal sediment processes. The NOC began life as the Liverpool Observatory in 1845 and since then has continued to predict tidal activity and monitor overall sea conditions. =Royal College of Physicians= Founded in 1518, the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) is a British professional body dedicated to improving the practice of medicine, chiefly through the accreditation of physicians by examination. In 2016 it was announced that Liverpool had beaten competition from Manchester and Leeds to become the home of the RCP's Northern Headquarters. The new facility will be housed in a building named 'The Spine' which will be situated on the former site of Archbishop Blanch secondary school. The ¬£35 million, 15-storey building will open in 2020 with the RCP using the bottom three and top four floors. The remaining seven floors are to be used by businesses in the education and science sectors. =Royal Liverpool University Hospital= The Royal Liverpool University Hospital is the largest general hospital in the city with over 50 wards and 850 beds, the accident and emergency department itself is the largest of its kind in the United Kingdom. The RLUH building which is sited on Prescot Street was built between 1966 and 1978 and is currently affiliated with both the University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University. In March 2010, plans to demolish the RLUH in 2012 were approved by the British Government, approximately ¬£328m was to be spent constructing a new state-of-the-art hospital on the same site, with in excess of ¬£100 million being spent on new equipment for the hospital. The 646 bed hospital was due to open in 2017 but the completion date slipped to 2018. In February 2018, the collapse of the construction company Carillion brought work on the hospital to a halt. Construction is not expected to be completed before the end of the year. Sensor City, Russell Street, Liverpool. = Liverpool Medical Institution = The Liverpool Medical Institution is one of the oldest institutions in the area, tracing its history back to 1779 when a group of local doctors created the Liverpool Medical Library. Today the institution \\"exists to foster an environment for furthering medical and health education and knowledge\\". = Sensor City = Sensor City, which opened in July 2017 is one of four pilot University Enterprise Zone projects established as a joint venture between Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Liverpool. to offer office space and on-site engineering support to small and start-up businesses. The purpose-built building is clad in an artwork costing ¬£500,000 in the form of 299 glass panels impregnated with a gold design in the theme of a printed circuit board. =University of Liverpool= The University of Liverpool was founded in 1881 as University College Liverpool and was granted university status in 1884 as part of the Victoria University. 1903 saw the institution become independent as the University of Liverpool. UoL is one of the original six 'red brick universities' and a member of the prestigious N8 and Russell Groups. Close to 20,000 students are enrolled at the University of Liverpool which offers more than 400 programmes covering 54 subject areas. Like Liverpool John Moores University, the UoL is also undergoing mass redevelopment ‚Äì around ¬£660 million is currently being invested in new buildings and facilities for the university. Paddington Village Paddington Village is a site at the eastern gateway to the city centre and has been earmarked as 1.8m sq ft of science, technology, education and health space. In November 2016 a draft masterplan was published, outlining the plans for the site, which will be developed in three phases: Paddington Central, Paddington South and Paddington North. The sites first two anchor tenants were announced as being a new Northern Centre of Excellence for the Royal College of Physicians and a new 45,000 sq ft education and learning facilities and 262 residential bed spaces for Liverpool International College. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson announced that the council were looking into a new Merseyrail station to serve the site. A mention of a station is made in the October 2017 Liverpool City Region Combined Authority update to the Long Term Rail Strategy. Merseytravel commissioned a feasibility report into re- opening the Wapping Tunnel in May 2016 which found that it was a valid proposal which would allow for a new station to be built that could serve the Knowledge Quarter. Initially, the plans included a 25-storey tower but after a public consultation in 2016 the plans were revised. Instead two gateway towers of no more than 15 storeys are planned. Liverpool International College hope to start work on a 13-storey tower block in May 2017. The block, which is hoped will be opened in January 2019, will have accommodation for 259 students as well as classrooms and a social hub. It was announced in March 2017 that a proton beam therapy cancer treatment centre would be built next to the new Royal College of Physicians site. The ¬£35 million Rutherford Cancer Centre is intended to be operational in 2018, offering radiotherapy, chemotherapy and imaging services. Proton beam therapy will become available at the centre in 2019. The planned construction of a new 250-bed hotel & serviced apartment facility was announced at the 2018 MIPIM global property expo in Cannes. In November 2018, it was announced that Accor Hotels would be operating the hotel as part of their Novotel brand. The new hotel will be a four-star 160 bedroom facility with a 60 bedroom aparthotel and should be open in 2021. At the 2018 Mipim UK property convention in London in October it was announced that Proton Partners, the parent company of Rutherford Cancer Centre, had started work on a headquarters for their Rutherford Diagnostics company. The building will also serve as a research centre and is sited next to their cancer treatment centre.

Prinzregent Luitpolds keel was laid in October 1910 at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel. She was launched on 17 February 1912 and was commissioned into the navy on 19 August 1913. The ship was equipped with ten guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of . Prinzregent Luitpold was assigned to III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career; in December 1916, she was transferred to IV Battle Squadron. Along with her four sister ships, , , , and , Prinzregent Luitpold participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916. The ship was also involved in Operation Albion, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, in late 1917. After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Prinzregent Luitpold and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships.

Prinzregent Luitpold was powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, supplied with steam by 14 coal-fired boilers. Unlike her four sisters, the ship was intended to use a diesel engine on the center shaft, but this was not ready by the time work on the ship was completed. The engine was never installed, and so Prinzregent Luitpold was slightly slower than her sisters, which were equipped with a third turbine on the center shaft.

Prinzregent Luitpold was armed with a main battery of ten 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets. The ship dispensed with the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, one forward and two of them arranged in a superfiring pair aft. The other two turrets were placed en echelon amidships, such that both could fire on the broadside. The ship was also armed with fourteen SK L/45 guns in casemates amidships, eight SK L/45 guns in casemates and four 8.8 cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. The ship's armament was rounded out by five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the hull; one was in the bow, and the other four were on the broadside. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by of KCA on the sides and faces. Prinzregent Luitpolds conning tower was heavily armored, with sides.  Service history  Ordered under the contract name Ersatz Odin as a replacement for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Prinzregent Luitpold was laid down at the Howaldtswerke dockyard in Kiel in October 1910. She was launched on 17 February 1912 and christened by Princess Theresa of Bavaria; Ludwig III, the last king of Bavaria and the son of the ship's namesake, Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria, gave a speech. After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 19 August 1913. Prinzregent Luitpold was equipped with facilities for a squadron commander, and became the flagship of III Battle Squadron upon commissioning. Directly after commissioning, Prinzregent Luitpold took part in the annual autumn maneuvers, which followed the fleet cruise to Norway. The exercises lasted from 31 August to 9 September. Unit drills and individual ship training were conducted in October and November. In early 1914, Prinzregent Luitpold participated in additional ship and unit training. The annual spring maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea at the end of March. Further fleet exercises followed in April and May in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship went to Kiel Week that year. Despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13 July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skadenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria- Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict. Prinzregent Luitpold was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. He intended to use the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the British Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding Prinzregent Luitpold and her four sisters‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany. Prinzregent Luitpold went into the Baltic for squadron training from 23 to 29 January 1916. While on the maneuvers, the newer battleship became III Squadron flagship. Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the commander of III Squadron, lowered his flag on 24 January and transferred it to K√∂nig. The Kaiser removed von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February, following the loss of the armored cruiser at the Battle of Dogger Bank the month before. Admiral Hugo von Pohl succeeded him as the commander of the fleet. Pohl continued the policy of sweeps into the North Sea to destroy isolated British formations. On 24 April, Prinzregent Luitpold ran aground in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, though she was freed without causing significant damage. A series of advances into the North Sea were conducted throughout the rest of 1915; Prinzregent Luitpold was present for the sweeps on 17‚Äì18 May, 29‚Äì30 May, 10 August, 11‚Äì12 September, and 23‚Äì24 October. III Squadron completed the year with another round of unit training in the Baltic on 5‚Äì20 December. Pohl's tenure as fleet commander was brief; by January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened him to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5‚Äì7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. Prinzregent Luitpold was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2‚Äì3 April. Another sortie was conducted on 21‚Äì22 April. = Battle of Jutland = alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Prinzregent Luitpold was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Prinzregent Luitpold was the third ship in VI Division of III Squadron and the seventh ship in the line, directly astern of and ahead of . VI Division was behind only V Division, consisting of the four s. The eight - and s of I and II Divisions in I Squadron followed VI Division. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions in II Battle Squadron formed the rear of the formation. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, K√∂nig, spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. Prinzregent Luitpold engaged the nearest target her gunners could make out, one of the s, at a range of some , though her shots fell short. Beatty's ships increased speed and at 17:51 veered away to further increase the distance to the III Squadron battleships. At 18:08, Prinzregent Luitpold shifted her fire to the battleship at a range of , though without any success. By 18:38, Malaya disappeared in the haze and Prinzregent Luitpold was forced to cease fire. The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, lay directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. Prinzregent Luitpold and her three sisters destroyed Nomad with their secondary guns while the I Squadron battleships dispatched Nestor. At around 19:00, the German battle line came into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; Prinzregent Luitpold fired two salvos from her main battery at an unidentified four- funneled cruiser at 19:03 but made no hits. Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser had become disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser ; Rear Admiral Paul Behncke in K√∂nig attempted to maneuver III Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. The eight III Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. The armored cruisers , , and joined in the attack on the crippled Wiesbaden. Between 19:14 and 19:17, several German battleships and battlecruisers opened fire on Defence and Warrior. Instead of joining the fire on the much closer cruisers, Prinzregent Luitpold engaged the leading battleships of the British line, firing a total of 21 salvos. The gunners reported ranges of , though this was an overestimation that caused the ship's salvos to fall past their intended target. By 20:00, the German line was ordered to complete a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold and was forced to haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. Prinzregent Luitpold came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed, which forced Kaiserin to remain out of line temporarily. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Prinzregent Luitpold was now the eighth ship from the rear of the German line, leading III Squadron. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night-cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line. After a series of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead, and Prinzregent Luitpold, Kaiserin, Kaiser, and stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In the course of the battle, Prinzregent Luitpold fired one-hundred and sixty-nine 30.5 cm shells and one-hundred and six 15 cm rounds. She and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed. = Subsequent operations = In early August, Prinzregent Luitpold and the rest of the operational III Squadron units conducted divisional training in the Baltic. On 18 August, Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers‚Äî and ‚Äîsupported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Prinzregent Luitpold, would trail behind and provide cover. During the operation, Prinzregent Luitpold carried the Commander of U-boats. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Another fleet advance followed on 18‚Äì20 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, Prinzregent Luitpold took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats‚Äî and ‚Äîthat had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four K√∂nig-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including Prinzregent Luitpold, were transferred to IV Squadron. Prinzregent Luitpold became the flagship of the new squadron. In the Wilhelmshaven Roads on 20 January 1917, the ship struck a steel hawser that became entangled in the ship's starboard propeller. In March, Friedrich der Grosse was replaced as the fleet flagship by the newly commissioned battleship . Friedrich der Grosse in turn replaced Prinzregent Luitpold as the flagship of IV Squadron. Steadily decreasing morale and discontent with rations provoked a series of small mutinies in the fleet. On 6 June and 19 July, stokers protested the low quality of the food they were given, and on 2 August, some 800 men went on a hunger strike. The ship's officers relented and agreed to form a Menagekommission, a council that gave the enlisted men a voice in their ration selection and preparation. One of the ringleaders of the protests, however, was arrested and executed on 5 September. = Operation Albion = alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of √ñsel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on √ñsel numbered some 14,000 men. The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while Prinzregent Luitpold and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on √ñsel. Prinzregent Luitpold, along with Kaiser and Kaiserin, were tasked with silencing the Russian guns at Hundsort which had taken Moltke under fire. The ships opened fire at 05:44, and by 07:45, Russian firing had ceased and German troops were moving ashore. Two days later, Vice Admiral Wilhelm Souchon left Tagga Bay with Prinzregent Luitpold, Friedrich der Grosse, and Kaiserin to support German ground forces advancing on the Sworbe Peninsula. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, √ñsel, and Dag√∂ were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the 24th, Prinzregent Luitpold was detached from the task force and returned to Kiel. After arriving in Kiel, Prinzregent Luitpold went into drydock for periodic maintenance, from which she emerged on 21 December. She then proceeded on to Wilhelmshaven, where she resumed guard duty in the Bight. On 17 March 1918, the ship steamed to the Baltic for training exercises, and the following day the battlecruiser rammed her outside Kiel. The accident caused no serious damage, however. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23‚Äì25 April 1918, after which she resumed guard duties in the German Bight. = Fate = alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. Prinzregent Luitpold and her four sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy\\". Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any circumstances. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men per ship. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Prinzregent Luitpold sank at 13:30; she was subsequently raised on 9 July 1931 and broken up by 1933 in Rosyth, as with several other vessels, upside-down having capsized in the scuttling.

The ship's armament was rounded out by five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the hull. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by of KCA on the sides and faces. K√∂nig Alberts conning tower was heavily armored, with sides.  Service history  Ordered under the contract name Ersatz √Ñgir as a replacement for the obsolete coastal defense ship , K√∂nig Albert was laid down at the Schichau-Werke dockyard in Danzig on 17 July 1910. She was launched on 27 April 1912; Princess Mathilde of Saxony christened the ship, and her brother, the last king of Saxony, Friedrich August III gave the speech. Following the completion of fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 31 July 1913. Although K√∂nig Albert was the last ship in her class to be launched, she was the third to be commissioned, owing to turbine damage on and delays on 's diesel engine. The ship was selected to form part of the special Detached Division, alongside her sister and the light cruiser . The Division was placed under the command of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) von Rebeur Paschwitz and sent on a tour of South America, with the goals of testing the new turbine propulsion system and representing the growing power of the Imperial Navy. The three ships left Wilhelmshaven on 9 December 1913 and steamed for German West Africa, where they made several stops, including Lom√©, Togo, and Victoria and Duala, Kamerun. The Division then proceeded to German South-West Africa, making stops in Swakopmund and L√ºderitzbucht, and South Africa, stopping in Saint Helena en route. On 15 February 1914, the Division reached Rio de Janeiro, which ceremonially greeted the visiting German warships. From Rio de Janeiro, Strassburg went to Buenos Aires, Argentina, while K√∂nig Albert and Kaiser steamed to Montevideo, Uruguay. Strassburg then rejoined the battleships in Montevideo, and all three then rounded Cape Horn and steamed to Valpara√≠so, Chile. Between 2 and 11 April they remained in Valparaiso, which marked the furthest point of their journey. On the return voyage, the three ships made additional stops, including in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, before returning to Rio de Janeiro. The Division then began the trip back to Germany, stopping in Cape Verde, Madeira, and Vigo. The ships reached Kiel on 17 June 1914, after having traveled some without incident. On 24 June, the Detached Division was dissolved, and K√∂nig Albert and Kaiser joined their classmates in III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. = World War I = The North Sea, where most major German fleet actions took place Throughout the first two years of the war, the High Seas Fleet, including K√∂nig Albert, conducted a number of sweeps and advances into the North Sea. The first occurred on 2‚Äì3 November 1914, though no British forces were encountered. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, adopted a strategy in which the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group raided British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. The raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15‚Äì16 December 1914 was the first such operation. On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding K√∂nig Albert and her four sisters‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire British Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned back toward Germany. Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Admiral von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet. Admiral von Pohl conducted a series of fleet advances in 1915 in which K√∂nig Albert took part; in the first one on 29‚Äì30 March, the fleet steamed out to the north of Terschelling and returned without incident. Another followed on 17‚Äì18 April, where K√∂nig Albert and the rest of the fleet covered a mining operation by II Scouting Group. Three days later, on 21‚Äì22 April, the High Seas Fleet advanced toward the Dogger Bank, though again failed to meet any British forces. On 15 May, a bushing came loose in the ship's starboard turbine, which forced the crew to turn the engine off and decouple it. The center and port side shafts were still capable of propelling the ship at , however. On 29‚Äì30 May, the fleet attempted to conduct a sweep in the North Sea, but inclement weather forced Pohl to cancel the operation some off Schiermonnikoog. The fleet remained in port until 10 August, when it sortied to Helgoland to cover the return of the auxiliary cruiser . A month later, on 11‚Äì12 September, the fleet covered another mine-laying operation off the Swarte Bank. The last operation of the year, conducted on 23‚Äì24 October, was an advance in the direction of Horns Reef which concluded without result. On 11 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer replaced the ailing von Pohl, who was suffering from liver cancer. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5‚Äì7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. On 25‚Äì26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided Tondern, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21‚Äì22 April. On 24 April, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group conducted a raid on the English coast. K√∂nig Albert and the rest of the fleet sailed in distant support. The battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short artillery duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters. After the raid on Yarmouth, several of the III Squadron battleships developed problems with their condensers. This included K√∂nig Albert; tubing needed to be replaced in all three main condensers, which necessitated extensive dockyard work. The ship went into drydock in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven on 29 May, two days before the rest of the fleet departed for the Battle of Jutland. Work on the ship was not completed until 15 June, and as a result, K√∂nig Albert was the only German dreadnought in active service to miss the battle. On 18 August 1916, K√∂nig Albert took part in an operation to bombard Sunderland. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan: the two serviceable German battlecruisers‚Äî and ‚Äîaugmented by three faster dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. Scheer would trail behind with the rest of the fleet and provide support. Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Another fleet operation took place on 18‚Äì19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Unit training in the Baltic was then conducted, and on the return voyage III Squadron was diverted to assist in the recovery of a pair of U-boats stranded on the Danish coast. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four K√∂nig-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including K√∂nig Albert, were transferred to IV Squadron. K√∂nig Albert saw no major operations in the first half of 1917, and on 18 August she went into drydock at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 23 September.  Operation Albion  alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German naval command decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. On 18 September, the Admiralstab (the Navy High Command) issued the order for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and Moon Islands. The naval component, organized as a Special Unit (Sonderverband), was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on √ñsel numbered some 14,000 men. The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while K√∂nig Albert and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on √ñsel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. On the morning of the 14th, K√∂nig Albert, Friedrich der Grosse, and Kaiserin were detached to support German troops advancing toward Ansek√ºll. K√∂nig Albert and Kaiserin were assigned to suppress a Russian battery at Zerel, though heavy fog delayed them from engaging the target. The Russians opened fire first, which was quickly returned by the two ships. Friedrich der Grosse came to the two ships' assistance and the three battleships fired a total of 120 large- caliber shells at the battery at Zerel over the span of an hour. The battleships' gunfire prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts. On the night of 15 October, K√∂nig Albert and Kaiserin were sent to replenish their coal stocks in Putzig. On the 19th, they were briefly joined in Putzig by Friedrich der Grosse, which continued on to Arensburg with Moltke. The next morning, Vice Admiral Schmidt ordered the special naval unit to be dissolved; in a communique to the naval headquarters, Schmidt noted that \\"Kaiserin and K√∂nig Albert can immediately be detached from Putzig to the North Sea.\\" The two ships then proceeded to Kiel via Danzig, where they transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal back to the North Sea. After returning to the North Sea on 23 October, K√∂nig Albert served as the flagship for a force of heavy ships, including Kaiserin, , , and the battlecruiser , supporting a mine-sweeping operation in the German Bight. Afterward she resumed guard duty in the Bight. = Fate = click for a larger view. K√∂nig Albert and her four sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied. The ship remained on picket duty in the Bight until 10 November. This kept her away from the mutinous vessels, until she returned to port and her crew joined the mutiny. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made it clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. This consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. K√∂nig Albert capsized and sank at 12:54. On 31 July 1935, the ship was raised and broken up for scrap over the following year in Rosyth.

It was part of the Reconquista fortifications that made up the Linha do Tejo (), a line of castles and outposts during the Middle Ages, recently integrated into a tourist region called the Regi√£o de Turismo dos Templ√°rios (). History The walls of the Abrantes Castle looking down on the urban settlement of the town The detention block, located in the central plan of the Castle in a commons used as a military square during the 18th century The area of the Abrantes Castle was at one time occupied by a Lusitanian castro structure. It was conquered during the Roman invasion of the peninsula around 130 BC by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus, and occupied for a time by Roman legions after Brutus expanded and remodelled it.Manuel Ant√≥nio Morato (1990), p.43 Successive invasions by Alans (411), Visigoths (492) and Moors (716) further indicated the strategic importance of this site, justifying the establishment of a permanent military garrison. However, the area and its river did not constitute an important link between the settlements of the Iberian Peninsula until the 12th century.Eduardo Campos (1984), p.6 During the Christian Reconquista (), the settlement in the area of Abrantes was taken from the Moors by forces in the service of Afonso Henriques (1112-1185), who restructured the defences of the site to attract settlers into the region.Eduardo Campos (1984), p.9 He granted the lands to the Order of Santiago (1172) so that they could watch over and assist pilgrims on the Way of Saint James. Later, it was incorporated into the Linha do Tejo () that the Knights Templar established to control and maintain the lands reconquered from the Muslims. The castle outpost, as well as the castles of Almourol, Castelo Branco, Monsanto, Pombal, Tomar, Torres Novas and Z√™zere formed a defensive barrier of garrisons along the middle course of the Tagus River. As part of this line, Abrantes was able to resist the forces of the Almohad Caliphate under the command of Moroccan Abem Jacob (1179), who retreated after suffering many deaths. Abrantes was rewarded for its heroic resistance by receiving a foral in 1179 and was rebuilt. During the reign of Sancho I (1185-1211), a new attack from the Almo√°da, under the command of Caliph Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur, was successful in 1191 in retaking all the Christian conquests in the territories south of the Tagus, with the exception of √âvora. In 1250, Afonso III (1248-1279) initiated a strengthening of the defences of the castle, including the construction of the prison block and an expansion of the walls, which was brought to completion between 1300 and 1303 in the reign of his successor Dinis. Afonso III donated the village of Abrantes to his wife, Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, beginning a tradition of royal patronage by the Queens of Portugal. During the Portuguese Interregnum Abrantes allied itself with the Master of Aviz, and fought the forces of Castile in the Battle of Aljubarrota. A new foral was conferred (1510) during the reign of Manuel I of Portugal (1495-1521). In 1531, the two top floors of the prison block were destroyed by the 1531 Lisbon earthquake.Manuel Ant√≥nio Morato (1981), p.59 In the second half of the 16th century, the Abrantes Castle entered into decline, particularly during the 1580 Portuguese succession crisis. In the context of the Portuguese Restoration War, in the last quarter of the 17th century, Peter II determined that the castle and its settlement should be reconstructed into a medieval castle-keep, in the style of Vauban. To this end, the medieval walls were lowered and strengthened, and two secondary walls were constructed within the bastions in 1704. By this process of remodelling, which included the construction of the palace of the Marquess of Abrantes (by Rodrigo de Almeida e Meneses, 1st Marquess of Abrantes), making the fortress a key to the Province of Estremadura. Similar expansions were accomplished in 1731 by the military engineer Engeleer, with the construction of the bastions and renovation of the already existing walls. In the 18th century, the castle's installations were adapted for use as a garrison of a regiment of Royal Cavalry. Between 1792 and 1799, the same quarters were expanded and occupied by a legion commanded by the Marquess of Alorna. By the beginning of the 19th century, during the Peninsular War the castle and town underwent, on two occasions, the passage of Napoleonic troops into Portugal: * on 22 November 1807, it was occupied by troops under the command of Jean-Andoche Junot, who took the title of Duke of Abrantes (March 1808); * in October 1810 it was reoccupied, after the rout of French troops at the Lines of Torres Vedras, under the command of Marshall Andr√© Mass√©na. In 1809, the fortifications were improved under engineer Manuel de Sousa Ramos, just before they were occupied by Mass√©na's forces, who destroyed the palace of the Marquess of Abrantes. Afterwards, the castle installations were de- activated as quarters, and converted to a military presidio, resulting in alterations to its structure. In 1860 repairs were made at the prison block, reinforced by an exterior wall, ordered built by the Baron of Batalh√£. In the middle of the 20th century, the castle's buildings and structures were classified as an Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest) by decree (July 1957) by the Direc√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGEMN) (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments). At the end of the 1960s, remodelling projects were advanced to consolidate and restore the walls of the castle, which continued until the 1970s (and included the partial reconstruction of the detention block). On 1 June 1992, the fort came under the authority of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrom√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico (IPPAR), forerunner of the Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (Decree 106F/92). In 2002, a program was established to maintain and promote the structure, which included a public tender to renovate the building; the castle was closed between 2002 and 2004 to enable renovations to be carried out. After these were concluded, the castle was formally re- inaugurated on 18 April 2004. Architecture The ancient church of Santa Maria do Castelo, located in a central level area within the castle walls Interior altar of the small church of Santa Maria do Castelo The Castle has an imposing position on the right margin of the Tagus River, surmounting a hilltop overlooking the town and local landscape. It is a characteristic hilltop fortification, located on a 197-metre high plateau dominating the town, designed to take advantage of the steep incline of the northeast escarpment. The southern, southeastern and eastern portions of the castle are reinforced by bastions and curtain walls. In addition to the isolated detention and block (in the centre of the grounds), the eastern end of the castle are dominated by the Pa√ßos do Marquis, Pa√ßos dos Condes and the church of the Santa Maria do Castelo. The military fort, like other medieval forts, was the centre of power and refuge in case of attack; the community lived outside the walls, in the almedina, a space that includes the two major churches of S√£o Vicente and S√£o Jo√£o.Ros√°rio Gordalina (1991); Isabel Mendon√ßa (1995); Fortaleza de Abrantes/Castelo de Abrantes Instituto da Habita√ß√£o e da Reabilita√ß√£o Urbana: Lisbon, Portugal The castle is constructed from masonry rock in an irregular polygonal form surmounting a rocky cliff face with steep vertical walls. Originally of Romanesque architecture, it took on aspects of Gothic architecture through successive additions, remodelling and rebuilding after the 13th century. The only remnants of the austere medieval castle are the detention block, the weapons portico (on the north-east angle) and the parapet for lookouts that commanded panoramic views of the region. The rectangular detention block in the middle of the castle commons originally had three levels, but the two upper levels were destroyed in the 1531 earthquake. Remodelling completed in the 19th century took from the character of the fa√ßade. The first line of walls are reinforced by cylindrical towers and interrupted by vertical openings. The castle's bastions, completed in the 18th century, are distributed around the older part of the settlement of Abrantes. The old military square, and on the western extent of the castle, are the ruins of the old Pa√ßo dos Condes de Abrantes(). Begun in 1530, by the sheriff of the vila, Diogo Fernandes de Almeida, it was designed to take advantage of the wall to reinforce the structure. The Pa√ßos, marked by grandiose architectural elements in the Baroque style, was substantially modified in the 18th century by the first Marquis of Abrantes, Rodrigo Anes de S√° Almeida e Menezes. Of these elements the loggia, consisting of an arcade of 11 perfect spans, aligned symmetrically on two cylindrical tiers, are the most distinctive part of the Abrantes complex. In the interior, the Church of Santa Maria do Castelo, in the Gothic style has been converted into a museum exhibiting a collection of Roman sculpture, funerary artefacts from the 15th and 16th century, as well as azulejos.

When Adam was about to marry them (Abel with Iqlimiya and Qabil with Layudha, respectively) Qabil protested and disobeyed because Habil's sister is less attractive and his own sister is beautiful. So he wants his twin sister for himself because he feels he is more entitled to his twin sister. Based on the revelations from Allah, Adam ordered both to sacrifice, who received the kurbanya then he was entitled to virtue (marrying the twin sister of Qabil). While according to a Shia Islamic version, from reports of the Shia Imams, it has been the tradition from the Prophets Adam to Muhammad that it is a sin for a brother to marry a sister and the protest and jealousy of Qabil was due to the acceptance of Habil's sacrifice and Habil being chosen as Adam's successor on Earth and Allah sent down houri from heaven to marry the sons of Adam. As such, according to a report from the 6th Shia Imam Jafar al-Sadiq, he narrated, ‚ÄúTwo thousand years before the creation of Adam, Allah ordered the Pen (al-Qalam) to inscribe on The Preserved Tablet (al-Lawh al- Mahfuz) all that was going to occur until the Day of Judgment. It included all the divine books. And in the books, Allah has made unlawful the sisters for their brothers. And at present all the four books. We see in Torah, Injeel, Zabur and Qur‚Äôan that were revealed by Allah to His Prophets through The Preserved Tablet that nowhere has Allah made the sister lawful for her brother.\\" The Imam continued to narrate that, \\"When Qabil killed Habil, Adam was very shocked that he cried for five hundred years and did not touch his wife. When he overcame his sorrow he cohabited and Allah gave him a son, Shith (Seth) who was born a single child. Shith was named Hibtullah (Gift of Allah). He was the first successor to whom a will was made. After Shith, Yafith was also born singly. When both grew up and Allah wanted to multiply human beings and as the Qalam had made the sisters unlawful for their brothers, Allah on a Thursday after Asr (afternoon time) sent a houri, Nazala and ordered Adam to marry Shith to her. Next day another houri, Mauzela was sent and Allah ordered that Yafith be married to her. Adam did as was told. Shith got a son and Yafith a daughter. When both attained maturity Allah ordered Adam to marry them and Adam obeyed. Thus, the lineage of Prophets and Messengers of Allah began.\\" In another narration, when asked for Qabil's reason of killing Habil, the 6th Imam replied, \\"Because Adam had appointed Habil as his successor. Allah revealed to Adam to hand over the successorship and the Grand Name to Habil while Qabil was the elder. When he knew this, he was angered and said that he was the rightful heir to the successorship and bounties. Under divine instructions, Adam asked both of them to present a sacrifice to Allah. Allah accepted Habil‚Äôs sacrifice and rejected Qabil‚Äôs so he envied Habil and killed him.\\" A depiction of Cain burying Abel from an illuminated manuscript version of Stories of the Prophets In the Qur‚Äôan Of Adam's first children, Cain was the elder son while Abel the younger. Each of them presented a sacrifice to God but it was accepted only from Abel, because of the latter's righteous attitude and his faith and firm belief in God. After the offering of their sacrifices, Cain, the wicked sibling, taunted Abel out of envy and told him that he would surely slay him. Abel justly warned Cain that God only accepted the sacrifice of those that are righteous in their doings. He further went on to tell Cain that if Cain did indeed try to slay him,: \\"'If thou dost stretch thy hand against me, to slay me, it is not for me to stretch my hand against thee to slay thee': for I do fear God, the cherisher of the worlds.'\\" Abel would not retaliate and slay him because the God-fearing would never murder for the sake of envy. Abel then told Cain that in murdering him, he would carry the weight not only of his sin but also of the sins of his victim.: \\"'For me, I intend to let thee draw on thyself my sin as well as thine, for thou wilt be among the companions of the fire, and that is the reward of those who do wrong.'\\" The victim, as a result, in suffering the injustice, would be forgiven his own sins and the murderer, while being warned, would consequently increase his own sin. Abel preached powerfully and reminded Cain that the punishment for murder would be that he would spend the afterlife in the fires of Hell. The innocent pleading and preaching of Abel had no effect upon Cain, for he was full of arrogance, pride and jealousy. He subsequently slew: \\"The (selfish) soul of the other led him to the murder of his brother: he murdered him, and became (himself) one of the lost ones.\\" the righteous Abel, but in doing so, he ruined himself and became of those who remain lost. This would be the earliest example of the murder of a righteous man taking place upon the earth. In the future, many other evildoers would slay the wise and pious believers. After the murder, Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show Cain how to hide the disgrace of his brother. Cain, in his shame, began to curse himself: \\"Then Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. 'O Woe to me!' said he. 'Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother?' Then he became full of regrets.\\" and he became full of guilt. The thought of the crime at last came to the murderer, as he realized indeed how dreadful it was to slay anyone, the more so as the victim was an innocent and righteous man. Full of regrets, Cain was marked with deep sorrow. The Qur'an states, \\"And he became of the regretful.\\" 5:31 (Chapter 5, verse 31) Message The Qur‚Äôan states that the story of Cain and Abel was a message: \\"On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our apostles with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land.\\" for mankind, as it had told them about the consequences of murder and that the killing of a soul would be as if he/she had slain the whole of mankind. But the Qur‚Äôan states that still people rejected the message of the story, and continued to commit grave sins, such as slaying prophets and other righteous people. All the prophets who preached since the time of Adam were persecuted, insulted or reviled in one way or another. With some righteous men, however, the Qur‚Äôan states that people went one step further, in attempting to slay them or indeed slaying them. As for the slaying of the righteous, it says \\"As to those who deny the Signs of God and in defiance of right, slay the prophets, and slay those who teach just dealing with mankind, announce to them a grievous penalty\\".

The Peutinger Table placed it between Gadara and Adraha (Daraa), 16 miles from each, and the Antonine Itinerary put it at 36 miles from Neve (Nawa, Syria).Jewish Virtual Library: \\"Capitolias\\" The Arabic name, Beit Ras, preserves the Aramaic name, Bet Reisha, mentioned in the 6th-century Talmud. Unfortunately, not very many ruins are left behind of the city of Capitolias. However, the main archaeological site remaining is a theatre structure.  History  Capitolias theatre with Beit Ras in the background. 2004 The town is one of the ten cities of the Decapolis listed by Pliny the Elder.Pliny's Natural History 5.16.74 There are many primary sources, including Pliny the Elder that list different variations of the cities of the Decapolis. Capitolias was founded as a planned Roman city, perhaps for military purposes, under Nerva or Trajan in 97 or 98 CE. This date comes from the coins that were minted within the city.Sim√©on Vailh√©, \\"Capitolias\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 3 (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908) Inscriptions show that local citizens served in the Roman army. It was surrounded by a wall built in the 2nd century and had an area of 12.5 hectares according to one source, 20 acres according to another. The city was named after Jupiter Capitolinus. Evidence shows that the site was extensively settled and grew in importance during the Roman and Byzantine eras. Capitolias also had some importance in the early Islamic (Umayyad) period. In the rearrangement associated with the creation of the Roman province of Arabia in 106, Capitolias became part of the province of Palaestina Secunda, whose capital was Scythopolis. It is mentioned by many geographers, including Hierocles and George of Cyprus in the 6th and 7th centuries. Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179‚Äì1229) noted about Beit Ras: \\"A village of Jerusalem, or, it is said, belonging to the Jordan Province, There are quantities of vines here, from which the celebrated wine is made.\\"le Strange, 1890, p. 415 Archaeology leftThe city wall, with three north-facing gates, can still be traced on the surface Other remains include a temple of the Capitoline Triad, a three-tiered marketplace, a colonnaded street, a 5th-century church that was converted into a mosque in the 8th century, an aqueduct, reservoirs, a Roman military cemetery, and paved roads. Although these remains were all excavated, many are quite minimal. The most prominent remains is that of the Roman style theatre. Although Capitolias was first excavated in the 1960s, systematic archaeological work began in the early 1980s and has continued.http://www.romanhideout.com/news/2003/jordantimes2003013.asp It seems the citizens of Capitolias wanted to appear very Greek. Tombstones of one family were discovered, and dated to the 2nd century CE. Not only had the deceased adopted Latin names, but the tomb also had a very Greek style scene painted on it. The painting was a scene from the Trojan War with Achilles dragging the body of Hector. Ample amounts of glass fragments have been discovered at the cite. These fragments were dated to 3rd-5th century CE. Further research has shown that large, primary chunks of glass were produced in the Levantine coastal area and brought to Capitolias for secondary production. So it seems that during the late Roman/early Byzantine eras, Capitolias was a main center for secondary glass production in Jordan. Further excavation of Capitolias is somewhat difficult because of the modern village, Beit Ras. Researchers want to respectfully work with the locals to further their findings of Capitolias. Only the part of the site without modern constructions could be studied by archaeologists. The ‚ÄúBeit Ras (Capitolias): an Archaeological Project‚Äù was conducted there from 2014 to 2016 by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan in cooperation with the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology and the Institute of Archaeology (both University of Warsaw), under the direction of Prof. Jolanta M≈Çynarczyk. The project consisted of a geophysical prospection (2014) and excavation works (2015‚Äì2016). The Polish-Jordanian excavations covered the northern part of the ancient city, to the west of the Roman theater. Non-invasive research using electrical resistivity scanning revealed remnants of urban architecture. Based on the pottery collected during the survey, it was determined that this area was in use from the 2nd to the 13th century. The excavation works yielded remains of defense walls, a winery, and workshops; the chronological sequence of the site from the Roman to the early medieval period was also established. In 2018, archaeologists has excavated a tomb dating to the 2nd century AD. Its walls are decorated with many figures of humans, animals, and gods, as well as a large painting illustrating the construction of a rampart along with 60 inscriptions describing what the figures in the painting were doing. In its entirety, the artwork is thought to describe the founding of the city. The captions, written in Aramaic with Greek letters, resemble the speech bubbles in modern comics.1,800-Year-Old Painted Tomb Discovered in Jordan Ruins in Capitolias  Bishopric  Bishops of Capitolias are mentioned in extant documents:Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 454 * Antiochus was at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 * Anianus/Ananias took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 * Bassus is mentioned in 518 * Two bishops named Theodosius are mentioned, one at the Council of Jerusalem in 536, the other in 600 A Peter who was martyred under Muslim rule is given by Le Quien and Gams as a bishop of Capitolias, but other sources describe him as a priest, not a bishop.David Richard Thomas et al.

Site description The Historic District is located Storrs in the town of Mansfield, Connecticut, flanking Storrs Road (Connecticut Route 195). The principal elements of the district are 23 masonry buildings erected between 1906 and 1942, in Collegiate Gothic, Colonial Revival, and Classical Revival styles. There are also 18 residential structures, some dating to the 18th century, and including the President's House, built in 1940. These are located in an area historically known as Faculty Row, which is now part of Whitney and Gilbert Roads. The master plan for the campus was drafted in the early 20th century by Charles N. Lowrie, a landscape architect, and was followed to a substantial degree by subsequent development. The only non-university buildings in the district are those associated with the Storrs Community Church. and UConn is historically significant as the nation's first public university established specifically for the study of agriculture. It was founded in 1880 as the Storrs Agricultural School, named for its donors (Charles and Augustus Storrs) and the village where its campus was located. The school remained small and focused on agriculture until the early 20th century. In 1906, the school began to expand both its physical plant and its curriculum, although the latter remained focused on agricultural subjects such as farm machinery and horticulture. This building program, largely completed by 1935, produced most of the assemblage of masonry buildings contained in the historic district. In 1933, the school was renamed Connecticut State College, and in 1939 it was given its present name. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.

They were produced as a response to a requirement by the Belgian Air Force,Jouhaud 1999, p.36 which became their biggest user, although private owners also bought a small number. The air force requirement was for a two-seat aircraft with aerobatic capabilities that could provide a next stage for students who had completed basic training on the RSV.32. Stampe et Vertongen contracted Alfred Renard to provide a design, and for the sake of expediency, suggested that he submit a revision of his RSV.32 rather than create an entirely new aircraft. The resulting RSV.26 was, like its predecessor, a conventional single-bay biplane with unstaggered wings of equal span.Hauet 1984, p.17 However, the fuselage was reinforced to accommodate engines of up to 150 kW (200 hp), the undercarriage legs were fitted with thicker bungee cords, and the pilot's and instructor's seats were now placed in two separate cockpits in tandem. The RSV.26 had wings of smaller span and area than the RSV.32, that were, despite appearances, a complete redesign of the older wing. The shorter span allowed the use of a more powerful engine and provided greater speed and maneuverability while not adversely affecting rate of climb. Power was provided by a 100-kW (140-hp) Minerva engine in the nose, driving a two-bladed propeller. The prototype made its public d√©but on 26 June 1926 at a rally at Ostende.Hauet 1984, p.13 The air force evaluated the type and judged it suitable. However, the new Minerva engines cost 50,000 BEF while the government could purchase war-surplus Hispano-Suiza engines from France for only 6,500 BEF. Consequently, Stampe et Vertongen was asked to adapt the design to the alternative powerplant. The firm was reluctant to accommodate the change, as the Hispano-Suiza engines and cooling systems were heavier than their Minerva counterparts, and had not only obsolete technology but were already used and worn-out. Nevertheless, the contract was too valuable to refuse, and Renard altered the design accordingly.Jouhaud 1999, p.37 The biggest change was to move the upper wing forward, staggering it with the lower wing to preserve the aircraft's centre of gravity.Jouhaud 1999, p.43 The change also provided improved access to and visibility from the forward cockpit. The air force purchased the RSV.26 in this form, now designated RSV.26/180 to reflect its more powerful engine. In service, it was known as the RSV d√©cal√© or 26 d√©cal√© (\\"staggered\\" in French). The start of the RSV.26/180's career was troubled by a handling problem that made three-point landings almost impossible. The cause was traced back to the factory: an error in making the templates for the wing ribs resulted in all the wings having the wrong profile. Stampe et Vertongen rectified this at the firm's own expense. Other problems with the type were due to the second-hand engines, which suffered continual mechanical breakdowns and by the early 1930s had contributed to a long list of accidents.Jouhaud 1999, p.38 To investigate a solution to the ongoing situation, the air force returned the RSV.26/140 prototype to the factory to be fitted with an Armstrong Siddeley Lynx engine.Hauet (1984, p.14) and Jouhaud (1999, p.38) agree that the RSV.26/140 was thus modified, although Hauet says this took place in 1929, while Jouhaud says it was 1933. De Maeyer (1980, pp.5‚Äì6) identifies the 26/140 with the first civil-registered 26/180, O-BADD. When the resulting modification proved successful, the air force had ten of its RSV.26/180s re-engined the same way. With the new engines fitted, they were redesignated RSV.26/215 or RSV.26 Lynx.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft p.2955Taylor 1989, p.89 Following their military careers, ten RSV.26/180s were sold to private owners in 1936.Jouhaud 1999, p.40Hauet 1984, p.16 Histories of Stampe et Vertongen differ on the number of RSV.26/140s and RSV.26/180s produced, with figures as disparate as 17 and 98De Maeyer (1980, p.5) claims this number appears in certain unspecified places, but does not accept it himself, calling it \\"a little too high\\". He suggests that the true number is closer to 60. Note that his own list on pages 5‚Äì6 includes six RSV.26/100s, which other authors such as Hauet (1984, p.22) and Jouhaud (1999, p.51) treat as a separate aircraft type. published. Variants ;RSV 26/140 :variant with a 100-kW (140-hp) Minerva engine (depending on the source, either one built or 29 built) ;RSV 26/180 :variant with a 130-kW (180-hp) Hispano-Suiza engine (depending on the source, any of: 16 built, ten for the air force and six for private owners; or 26 built, 20 for the air force and six for private owners; or up to 43 built, up to 38 for the air force and five for private owners.de Maeyer (1980, p.5‚Äì6) refers to 28 machines built for the air force in 1926, ten more in 1932‚Äì33, plus five built for private operators. His claim that RV.26/180 O-BADD was converted from the RSV.26/140 prototype accounts for the discrepancy with Hauet's and Jouhaud's figures for RSV.26/180s built for private owners, since they both list O-BADD as built as an RSV.26/180 from the beginning. De Maeyer (1984, p.5) also suggests that the 28 machines built in 1926 might have been converted from RSV.26/140s. Note that Hauet and Jouhaud claim that the RSV.26/140 was unique and not produced in series.) One RSV.26/180, civil registration O-BADE, was converted to an amphibious floatplane for a time.de Maeyer 1980, p.6Jouhaud 1999, p.39 ;RSV 26/215 or RSV 26 Lynx :variant with a 160-kW (215-hp) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx (depending on the source, either one converted from the RSV.26/140 and ten converted from RSV.26/180s or ten builtde Mayer 1980, p.5, although he states that there is a \\"serious doubt\\" that these were totally new aircraft and not re-engined RSV.26/140s.)

Mills were operated on the site from colonial times until 1877, when the last mill burned. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history Valley Falls Park is located in southeastern Vernon, south of Valley Falls Road and west of Bolton Road. The park is largely wooded with large areas of wetlands. Its developed facilities are at the northern end, where there is public parking. The park is set in the valley drained by Railroad Brook, which flows north through the park. At the northern end is a former millpond, impounded by a stone dam, below which are the remnants of the mills. Industrial use of Railroad Brook is documented to begin in the mid-18th century, when a sawmill is recorded to be on the site. By the early 19th century, that mill is augmented by a flaxseed processing oil mill. IN 1847, the latter mill was converted to textile manufacture, producing woolen cloth. The height of the dam is known to have been raised twice in the 1850s, in order to accommodate increased power demands. A property deed in 1860 records the property as including a stone mill, miller's house, and other outbuildings. The complex was destroyed by fire on February 3, 1877, the only building to surviving being an employee boarding house. The proprietors had underinsured the property, and were apparently financially unable to rebuild.

Regimental Combat Team 2, with the assistance of 2nd Squadron 14th Cavalry Regiment had planned to carryout Operation Lightning Strike II in August-targeting the town of Anah and the town of QƒÅdisiyyah to disrupt insurgent activities and show the Iraqi government the deployment of a competent security force. However the operation did not take place due to the clashes in Haditha and were reallocated to Operation Quick Strike (3‚Äì11 August). The force cordoned off and searched Haqlaniyah and Barwanah, 2nd LAR and 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines prepared to move into Haqlaniyah, whilst K and L Companies of 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines and 2nd platoon A Company, 1st Tank Battalion moved into an assembly area west of the Euphrates after an Iraqi special operations company secured it; Iraqi troops from the 1st Division were part of the operation. L Company of 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines and 2nd platoon A Company, 1st Tank Battalion prepared to clear Barwanah. Marines from 1st Force Reconnaissance Company provided raid and sniper support. On 4 August, Marine battalions attacked through the villages from the north, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines only encountered sporadic resistance and set a base to support continuing operations. Resistance in both Haditha, Haqlaniyah and Barawanah increased, the added combination of supporting airstrikes suppressed resistance. The body of the missing Marine was found in Haqlaniyah; the Operation resulted in 15 insurgents killed and a further 63 detained, Coalition forces lost 14 killed and 6 wounded, one Iraqi special forces operative was also killed.Gilbert, Oscar E., Marine Corps Tank Battles in the Middle East, 2015, Casemate Operation Cyclone On 11 September, 2nd LAR and Iraqi forces established a cordon around Ar-Rutbah to begin Operation Cyclone. Marine Force Recon and Iraqi special forces swept through the town from the north whilst K company, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines, supported by AAV's and a platoon from 2nd LAR, swept in from the south, targeting pre-selected houses. The operation was the last conducting by 2nd LAR in Iraq before rotating back to the United States in September. Operations Mustang, Lightning Strike and Green Light 4th squadron, 14th Cavalry Regiment, cleared the village of al-Ash on 16 September (known as Operation Mustang); they repeated this in Operation Lightning Strike on 28‚Äì29 September, clearing Anah and Qadisiyah (the operation deferred by RCT-2 in August because of the substitution of Operation Quick Strike to clear Barwanah and to stop counterattacks against 3d Battalion, 25th Marines). 3rd Battalion 504th Infantry Regiment cleared a military housing compound in Baghdadi in Operation Green Light.https://fas.org/irp/doddir/usmc/iraq03-06.pdf Operation Iron Fist Between 1‚Äì7 October, 3rd Battalion, 6th Marines carried out its first major operation since relieving 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines in Al-Qaim-Operation Iron Fist, in the village of Sadah and the eastern half of Karabillah; its aim was to eliminate insurgents, clear routes and establish battle positions. The Marines were supported by a platoon each of tanks, combat engineers and amphibious assault vehicles; the operation also provided a deception to distract insurgents while units prepared for Operation River Gate. On 1 October, the task force cleared Sadah from east to west with three rifle companies, fighting sporadically with insurgents who fought from prepared positions with small arms, rocket launchers, mortars and explosive devices. The task force killed an estimated 12 insurgents and encamped on a wadi between Sadah and Karabillah, a troop of the 4th squadron 14th Cavalry Regiment screened the left bank of the Euphrates river whilst mobile assault platoons of the Marine battalion's weapons company blocked the roads between the two towns. 2 October saw stiffer opposition from the insurgents fighting in Karabillah, the Marines advanced through the town over the following 3 days, using all their direct fire weapons and mortars, Marine aircraft delivered rockets, hellfire missiles, GBU-12s and other bombs. The insurgent death toll increased to 51, whilst the task force lost 1 Marine killed and 9 wounded; the operation ended on 7 October, with two battle positions established for two rifle platoons, patrolling and small arms engagements continued for several weeks, but a foothold for further operations in the west had been established-which would be Operation Steel Curtain. Operation River Gate Between 3‚Äì19 October (some sources say 20) 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st LAR and 3rd Battalion 504th Infantry Regiment, along with Iraqi security forces carried out Operation River Gate to continue the disruption of insurgents in Hadithah, Haqlaniyah and Barwanah and secure the towns. The Coalition forces encountered numerous small arms fire attacks and 13 IED attacks; Marine Aircraft Group 26 carried out heliborne assaults with elements of the 82nd Airborne Division, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st brigade of the Iraqi 1st Division and the 2nd Marine Division with the units surrounding Haditha. In addition, helicopters assigned to Army paratroopers and Regimental Combat Team 2 also conducted a combined air assault raid by 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion and an Iraqi special operations company in the vicinity of Abu Hyat against a known HVT, the force took several detainees, Coalition forces killed 12 insurgents and detained over 172 more, they also found 32 weapons cashes alond with 95 IED devices and mines, the completion on the operation resulted in a permanent base being established to provide continued security. 3rd platoon, C Company, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion established bases in each town. Operation Steel Curtain Operation Steel Curtain was focused on disrupting and denying AQI safe havens and freedom of movement in western Al- Anbar Governorate, establishing a persistent presence in this region, restoring Iraqi control of the border with Syria, and setting the conditions for the constitutional referendum and national election. Operation Steel Curtain began on 3 November and lasted until 22 November; entailing considerable fighting Syria-Iraq border, which resulted in the elimination of a significant foreign fighter force.Shultz, Robert, The Marines Take Anbar: The Four-Year Fight Against Al Qaeda, 2013, Naval Institute Press, A combined US Marine, Army and Iraqi Army Task Force swept west to east through Husaybah and continued east through Karabillah, clearing both towns of local insurgents and foreign jihadist and established a permanent presence in the town. Nearly two weeks into the Operation, US Marines cleared the town of Ubaydi, throughout the fight, the marines had to call in continuous air support, in total 67 airstrikes were called in by controllers and over 100 precision- guided bombs munitions were employed, aviation played a crucial role in combat resupply of tank ammunition and water as well as multiple casualty evacuations. The Marine assault forces suffered 10 killed and 59 wounded, whilst the insurgents lost 139 killed and 388-400 captured. In the aftermath of the operation, the Iraqi 1st Brigade was able to establish its headquarters in Al-Qaim. On 19 November Haditha killings took place.J Schlosser, Nicholas, U.S. Marines in Iraq, 2004 - 2008 Anthology and Annotated Bibliography: U.S. Marines in the Global War on Terrorism, 2012, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform ISBN, 1470095246 Operation Iron Hammer Between 30 November ‚Äì 4 December, 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines carried out Operation Iron Hammer-a clearing action across the Euphrates from Hit, while 2nd Battalion, 114th Field Artillery Regiment and the Iraqi 1st battalion, 2nd Brigade, 7th Division secured Hit itself. The Marine battalion, a company of Iraqi troops and 30 Desert protector scouts (also known as Army scouts)Mockaitis, Thomas R., The Iraq War Encyclopedia , ABC-CLIO, 2013 crossed to clear Hai al-Becker district and to establish a base for the Iraqi battalion to occupy, thereby securing the eastern side of the city. With this improved security, the Hit bridge was reopened to foot traffic, the operation also detained 19 suspected insurgents and removed 9 IEDs. =Operation Liberty Express= Operation Liberty Express was conducted from 1 September through to 30 December by US and Iraqi forces to protect the polling stations on 15 October's referendum and on 15 December national election. The operation focused on expanding Coalition forces and the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior control throughout Al-Anbar Governorate, while providing support to the Independent Electoral Commission in Iraq for the constitutional referendum and elections. Operation Liberty Express was an extension of Operation Guardian Sword (6 June ‚Äì 15 August)-the operations objectives called for neutralizing the insurgencies in Ramadi while covering the rotation of combat units and personnel in other units to support the upcoming referendum and election, the operation included a number of subsidiary operations, Operation Guardian Sword ended with the relief of a US Army Brigade assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. Operation Lightning Express composed of four subsidiary phase operations: one of which was Operation Guardian Shield which was aimed at covering force rotations over a two-month period. The units of the 2nd Marine Division conducted over 30 operations to create the secure environment of the referendum and elections to take place, with counter insurgency operations being conducted in nearly every city across Al-Anbar Governorate, capitalizing on progress made in other operations. In addition to killing almost 1,000 insurgents and detaining almost 4,000 more, over 500 weapons caches were discovered(the significant weapons cache included more than 10,000 artillery, mortar and rocket rounds, 70 250-pound bombs and 5 surface-to-air missile systems. The operation successfully culminated on 15 December with the elections and ended on 22 December-thus ending Operation Sayeed. =Operation Sayeed (Hunter) II= Phase II of Operation Sayeed began in September, it was known as Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq called Operation Sayeed (Hunter) II would establish indigenous forces in Al Anbar Governorate, secure the region along the Syrian border and interdict insurgent activity all along the Euphrates River Valley. Many local operations would exploit sweeps by establishing permanent presences in an increasing number of towns and civil affairs programmes would concentrate on encouraging anti-insurgent sentiment among Sunni leaders and the populace. Forces were still inadequate to either control the Syrian border or control the large area along the river valley, part of the effort to restrict insurgent traffic was to destroy selected bridges across the Euphrates with airstrike and Army MLRS, and to establish random chekcpoints along major roads on the south bank. In September, a full Iraqi Army brigade joined the operation and made a significant contribution to the operation in the Western Euphrates River Valley at that time. The 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, executed special planning and coordination for operation, whilst in support of the operation the II Marine Expeditionary Force delivered critically needed humanitarian assistance which was used to support Internally Displaced Persons camps and other humanitarian needs. In October, the operation showed its first results when 1st Brigade, of the Iraqi 1st Division established a headquarters in Al-Qaim, signalling the beginning of the border force to in Al-Anbar, also October, the operation showed further results with the deployment of reliable Iraqi units (three battalions 3rd Brigade, 7th Division were arriving in strength to secure the border towns beginning with Hit, Hadithah and Rawah. Operation Iron Fist and Operation River Gate covered their deployment into the Governorate. =Area of Operations Raleigh= Operation Constitution Hammer In October, F Company, 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines, and 1st Battalion, 2nd Brigade of the Iraqi Army to carryout Operation Constitution Hammer: Its aim was to disrupt insurgent activity along the main supply routes in Fallujah, as well as find weapons caches and kill or capture insurgents. F Company established a cordon security whilst its 2nd Platoon along with the Iraqi troops searched the buildings that were encircled. The Marines searched every building within their area of responsibility, after the buildings were inspected and cleared, control was turned over to the Iraqi army, the mission was a success, Iraqi troops unearthed a large cache of weapons and denied the insurgents the ability to operate in the area. Operation Trifecta Between 10‚Äì20 November 144 U.S. Marines of E, F and Weapons Companies of 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines, inserted by helicopter into 3 landing zones, with direct support two squads of Combat Engineers from 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, carried out Operation Trifecta in Zaidon, whilst D Company, 2nd Tank Battalion, elements of 1st Reconnaissance Battalion (who carried out Operation Southern Hunter), elements of 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion and Team Traveller (part of Regimental Combat Team 8‚Äôs headquarters company and U.S. Army B Troop, 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry Regiment) acted as blocking forces for the raids on 14 November. The rapid setup of the cordon prevented insurgents escaping the area. US forces carried out house-to-house searches (particularly in the Sadan market) and wide spread cache sweeps; the operation also integrated communications jamming by EA-6B Prowler . According to Maj Timothy M. Bairstow The Marines detained more than 30 suspected insurgents and located more than 1,000 artillery rounds, mortar and rockets; 20,000 rounds of ammunition for small arms and over a dozen weapon systems, including AK-47‚Äôs and Rocket Propelled Grenade launchers.Emering, Edward, The History of Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2012, Lulu.com, Operations in AO Raleigh continued actions in and around Fallujah and searched for weapon caches, such as Operation Southern Fire (24‚Äì29 August). =Area of Operations Topeka= Operation Guardian Sword Operation Guardian Sword (6 June ‚Äì 15 August)- was an operation whose objectives called for neutralizing the insurgencies in Ramadi while covering the rotation of combat units and personnel in other units to support the upcoming referendum and election, the operation included a number of subsidiary operations, Operation Guardian Sword ended with the relief of the two US Army Brigade assigned to the 2nd Marine Division. Operation Mountaineers, Tigers, Shank CNN reported that on 4 October 500 U.S. troops and 400 Iraqi security forces began Operation Mountaineers: The force carried out \\"cordon and search operation\\" in Ramadi's southern district of Tammin, the operation was aimed to \\"disrupt insurgents in southern Ramadi who are transporting weapons and munitions into the city.\\" After 4 Marine CH-47E helicopters instrted A Troop, 1st Squadron, 167th Cavalry Regiment into blocking positions southeast of the city, C Company, 1st Battalion, 172nd Armor Regiment established a cordon to isolate the southeast corner of the city. From the North, two Army infantry companies, accompanied by 1st and 3rd battalion, 1st brigade, Iraqi 7th Division cleared and secured their target districts on the southern side of the canal, while 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines cleared the north side of the canal, accompanied by 2nd battalion, 1st brigade, Iraqi 7th Division and supported by a tank platoon from D Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment. US Marines and soldiers and Iraqi troops searched all houses and vehicles in a major demonstration of combined US-Iraqi forces. After being attacked by small arms, explosives dives and rocket fire 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines called in fixed and rotary wing air support, which remained overhead until all objectives were cleared and the Marines returned to base. The 2nd Brigade, 28th Infantry Division carried out Operation Tigers (25‚Äì26 November)-a clearing operation in the Mulaab district of eastern Ramadi, with both fixed and rotary-wing aircraft in support. 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines and 2nd battalion, 1st Brigade, 7th Iraqi Division carried out Operation Shank (2‚Äì3 December)- a cordon and search mission in the same area and the adjacent al-Dubaht district to find weapons cashes and to disrupt insurgent activities. Aftermath Operation Liberty Express ended on 22 December-thus Operation Sayeed. Operation Sayeed resulted in a number of accomplishments and successes, many AQI terrorists and insurgents were killed which weekend the insurgency and their activities were disrupted; places where the insurgents felt secure were eliminated; AQI's leadership was disrupted and were not able to operate freely in that part of the country. It was the first time US forces had carried operated on a large scale with Iraqi forces. The operation's significant disruption to AQI's organisation had a lasting effect across Al-Anbar Governorate, in addition to destroying much of the AQI leadership and command-and-control functions, this operation significantly improved opinions among the local population of western Al-Anbar, as the operation stopped AQI's murder and intimidation campaign that was successful in preventing locals from assisting Coalition forces; a permanent Iraqi Security force presence was established across most of the western Euphrates River valley, consequently eliminating AQI influence and restoring a sense of security among the local populace, who were then more willing cooperate and assist Coalition and Iraqi Army forces. The success of the operation also ensured the safety and maximum participation of Iraqi citizens in the constitutional referendum and national elections, the security of the polling stations on 15 October and 15 December was carried out by Iraqi Security Forces-demonstrating significant progress in the Security force. Throughout the Operation, the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing flew approximately 11,172 sorties and 22,012 flight hours in support of the operation.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. and Description and history Mansfield Center Cemetery is located south of the modern center of Mansfield, at the southeast corner of Storrs and Cemetery Roads. It is a roughly rectangular area in size, ringed by a fieldstone wall. A line of trees separate the cemetery from Storrs Road, and there is a gate with stone posts providing entrance to the ground. The cemetery grounds are densely filled with burial sites, with the burials uniformly oriented with the head to the east, and headstones with the carved face to the west. Only a few more elaborate monuments (typically of mid to late 19th century origin) dot the grounds. The oldest dated marker is for Exercise Conant, who died in 1722. Mansfield was settled as part of Windham in 1690, and was separately incorporated in 1704. The site was set aside for use as a cemetery as early as 1693 and it remained in general use for that purpose until the 1870s. The cemetery's 18th-century gravestones, decorated with cherubim, geometric designs, and a variety of funerary symbols, are considered to be illustrative of the rich artistic tradition of funerary stone carving in colonial New England. More than 180 stones have been attributed to identifiable stone carvers, including several 18th-century masters of the craft.

Expected to debut in 2011, FOX opted not to buy it. The plot focuses on adventure stories centered on three children who become the caretakers of a New England mansion that is home to a bevy of secrets and magic. Plot summary The story focuses on the Locke family as they move into Keyhouse, after the tragic murder of patriarch Rendell (Mark Pellegrino). Nina (Miranda Otto) and her three children, Tyler (Jesse McCartney), Kinsey (Sarah Bolger), and Bode (Skylar Gertner) meet up with Rendell's brother Duncan (Nick Stahl) and look to get a fresh start. Keyhouse has been home to the Lockes for hundreds of years. Rendell and Duncan lived there growing up, but Duncan has blocked out a lot of his memories of the place. After exploring the grounds a bit, Bode finds a key with a skull on it. When he steps through the door that the key unlocks, his body drops dead but his spirit is able to fly around the house. This catches the attention of an \\"echo\\" named Dodge (Ksenia Solo), who is trapped deep within the well on the grounds. Something is clearly dark about her and we find out that she's been manipulating Rendell's killer, Sam Lesser (Harrison Thomas). The Ghost Key that Bode found is one of many scattered around the area. Each one does something special. Dodge has her eyes set on the Anywhere Key, which can transport you wherever you want to go. Production Dimension Films acquired the film and television rights for Welcome to Lovecraft from IDW Publishing with the intent of developing the property as a feature with John Davis producing. In February 2010, it was announced that Dimension had lost the adaptation rights to Dreamworks with Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci signed on to develop and produce the project. In August 2010 Steven Spielberg also joined as a producer, and the production became a TV series rather than a movie adaptation, with Josh Friedman penning episodes for the show and acting as show-runner. The TV series adaptation then landed at 20th Century Fox Television. The network greenlit a pilot, produced by Dreamworks TV and K.O. Paper Products through the latter's deal with 20th Century Fox TV. Miranda Otto played Nina Locke, Sarah Bolger was Kinsey Locke and Nick Stahl co-starred as Duncan Locke. Skylar Gaertner played 6-year old Bode, and Harrison Thomas played a teenager manipulated by an evil spirit. Actor and singer Jesse McCartney appeared as Ty Locke, the series' male lead and Ksenia Solo was cast as Dodge. Mark Romanek directed the pilot episode, which was filmed at the mansion in Hartwood Acres and in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania in February 2011. The pilot was also shot throughout Pittsburgh that same month. In May 2011, Fox announced that the project would not be picked up to the series. The studio attempted to sell the project to other networks but eventually ceased efforts due to rising costs. However, the show has been eyed by MTV, though no official talks have been had yet. The pilot was screened at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was well received. In January 2020, the pilot was leaked by Bloody Disgusting, who later uploaded it to Vimeo.

Matuku Critical reception James Ferguson of HorrorTalk gave Locke & Key four stars (out of five) and said, \\"The acting throughout the episode is fantastic. You really feel for the Locke family as they attempt to recover from this horrible event in their lives. McCartney and Bolger have great chemistry as brother and sister, playing off of one another very well. Unfortunately for them, young Skylar Gertner steals every scene he's in. In many ways, he is the star of the pilot as he's the catalyst for Dodge's release from her prison as well as the search for the keys. Sometimes it takes a child's imagination to look past the restrictions most of us place on our thoughts, especially when it comes to the supernatural. The story unfolds with subtlety. We're not shown the exact events regarding Rendell's death, but we're given hints as to what happened based on the character's actions and emotions. It isn't until much later that we're given the details as well as why one of the family members feels responsible. Obviously I don't know how faithful the pilot is to the original comic, but the setup that we get from this episode would have been great for a weekly program. There's a nice reveal at the very end that would create the basis for at least a full season\\".

It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously. The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States Army (US) and Republic of Korea Army (ROK) troops repelled a strong Korean People's Army (KPA) attack. Attempting to capture Taegu as part of the Great Naktong Offensive, the KPA 1st and 13th Divisions advanced to the hill masses north of the city where they confronted the US 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK 1st Division. The KPA sought to occupy a number of hill masses, most prominently Hill 902, known to South Koreans as Ka-san, for the ancient fortress situated atop it. In two weeks of fighting in and around the fortress, the KPA were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the KPA were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of engineers to fight on the front lines, eventually preventing the KPA from advancing long enough for the KPA to be outflanked by the Inchon landings on 15 September and on 16 September the UN forces began their breakout from the Pusan Perimeter which drove the KPA from the area.  Background  = Pusan Perimeter = From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North, the KPA had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the ROK and the UN forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing. The KPA tactics were to aggressively pursue UN forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively, attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit, which allowed the KPA to surround and cut off the opposing force, which would then be forced to retreat in disarray, often leaving behind much of its equipment. From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August, the KPA used these tactics to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south. However, when the UN forces, under the Eighth United States Army, established the Pusan Perimeter in August, the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which KPA troops could not flank, and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN forces. Map of the Pusan Perimeter Defensive line in September 1950 the Kyongju corridor is the northeasternmost sector. When the KPA approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter. Throughout August, the KPA 6th Division, and later the KPA 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan, initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam-ni and Battle Mountain. These attacks stalled as UN forces, well equipped and with plenty of reserves, repeatedly repelled KPA attacks. North of Masan, the KPA 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area. In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge, the KPA division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it, and on August 19, the KPA 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties. In the Taegu region, five KPA divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the KPA 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack. On the east coast, three more KPA divisions were repulsed by the ROK at P'ohang-dong during the Battle of P'ohang-dong. All along the front, the KPA troops were reeling from these defeats, the first time in the war their tactics were not working. = September push = In planning its new offensive, the KPA command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. The plan called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered. The center attack called for the KPA 3rd, 13th and 1st Divisions to break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to Taegu.  Battle  US Troops observe North Korean-held Hill 518 during the Battle of Tabu-dong. Simultaneous with their attack at Ka-san, UN and KPA units were similarly deadlocked a short distance away in the Battle of Tabu-dong. In that sector, KPA Major Kim Song Jun of the 19th Regiment, 13th Division had defected to the UN troops on September 1. He reported that a full-scale KPA attack was to begin at dusk that day. The 13th Division, he said, had just taken in 4,000 replacements, 2,000 of them without weapons, and was now back to a strength of approximately 9,000 men. Upon receiving this intelligence, 1st Cavalry Division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay alerted all of his division's front-line units to be prepared for the attack. ROK 1st Division commander Major General Paik Sun Yup also braced his men for attack. = North Korean attack = Hard on the heels of Kim's warning that the KPA attack would strike the night of September 2, the attack hit with full force in the Bowling Alley area north of Taegu. The attack caught the US 8th Cavalry Regiment unprepared at Sangju. The division was poorly deployed along the road to that town, lacking a reserve force to counterattack effectively. The KPA struck the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, the night of September 2‚Äì3 on Hill 448 west of the Bowling Alley and north of Tabu-dong, and overran it. On the right, E Company, although not under attack, was cut off and had to withdraw. The commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion placed I Company in a blocking position just north of Tabu-dong astride the road. There, two KPA T-34 tanks and some infantry struck it at 02:00 on September 3. In this action, I Company suffered many casualties but repelled the attack. The overrun 2nd Battalion withdrew through the 3rd Battalion which had assembled hastily in a defensive position south of Tabu-dong. During the day, elements of the KPA 1st Division forced the 8th Cavalry I&R; Platoon and a detachment of National Police from the Walled City of Ka-san on the crest of Hill 902, east of Tabu-dong. On September 3, therefore, the UN command, the Eighth United States Army lost both Tabu-dong and Hill 902, locally called Ka-san, the dominant mountain-top north of Taegu. The North Koreans now concentrated artillery north of Hill 902 and, although its fire was light and sporadic, it did cause minor damage in the 99th Field Artillery positions. This sudden surge of the North Koreans southward toward Taegu concerned the Eighth Army commander, Lieutenant General Walton Walker. The Army ordered an ROK battalion from the Taegu Replacement Training Center to a position in the rear of the 8th Cavalry, and the 1st Cavalry Division organized Task Force Allen, to be commanded by Assistant Division Commander Brigadier General Frank A. Allen, Jr. This task force comprised two provisional battalions formed of division headquarters and technical service troops, the division band, the replacement company, and other miscellaneous troops. It was to be used in combat as an emergency force should the North Koreans break through to the edge of Taegu. = US counterattack on Ka-san = North Korean attacks on Taegu, September 1950 Eighth Army countered the KPA advance down the Tabu-dong road by ordering the 1st Cavalry Division to recapture and defend Hill 902. This hill, north of Taegu, gave observation all the way south through Eighth Army positions into the city, and, in KPA hands, could be used for general intelligence purposes and to direct artillery and mortar fire. Hill 902 was too far distant from the Tabu-dong road to dominate it; otherwise it would have controlled this main communication route. The shortage of KPA artillery and mortar ammunition reduced the advantages the peak held as an observation point for the KPA. Despite being popularly known as the \\"walled city,\\" there was no walled city on the crest of Ka-san in 1950. Ka-san, or Hill 902, the mountain which differs from most high peaks in this part of Korea in having an oval-shaped semi-level area on its summit. This oval is a part of a ridge-like crest, varying from to in width, which slopes down from the peak at to approximately at its southeastern end. On all sides of this ridge crest the mountain slopes drop precipitously. In ancient times, Koreans had built a stone wall around the crest and had converted the summit into a fortress. Most of the summit in 1950 was covered with a dense growth of scrub brush and small pine trees. There were a few small terraced fields. Koreans knew Ka-san as the \\"Sacred Mountain\\". Near the northern end of the crest still stood the Buddhist Poguk Temple. When the 1st Cavalry Division on August 29 assumed responsibility for the old ROK 1st Division sector north of Taegu it sent a patrol from the I&R; Platoon to the top of Ka-san. There the patrol found 156 National Police. There was some discussion between Gay and Walker about whether the 1st Cavalry Division or the ROK 1st Division should have the responsibility for the mountain. Gay maintained that his understrength division with a front was already overextended and could not extend eastward beyond the hills immediately adjacent to the Tabu-dong road. Uncertainty as to final responsibility for Ka-san ended on the afternoon of September 3 after the KPA had seized the mountain. The Eighth Army telephoned Colonel Ernest V. Holmes, Chief of Staff of the 1st Cavalry Division, and told him that the 1st Cavalry Division had responsibility for the Walled City. Holmes replied he would send a company of engineers to Ka-san. Holmes ordered Lieutenant Colonel William C. Holley, commanding officer of the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, to report to Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment. That afternoon Palmer in his command post on the Tabu-dong road outlined to Holley and the commanding officers of D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, and E Company, 8th Cavalry, his attack plan to regain control of Ka-san. The Engineer company, commanded by First Lieutenant John T. Kennedy, was to lead the attack, E Company following. Once the force had gained the crest and E Company had established itself in defensive positions, the Engineer company was to come off the mountain. Many of the men in D Company were veteran infantrymen who had fought in World War II. That evening, D Company loaded into trucks traveled north to the assembly area through a heavy rain. On the way they met two truckloads of National Police going south, some of them wounded. These were the police who, together with the detachment of the I&R; Platoon, had been driven off Ka-san that afternoon. After waiting in the rain awhile for orders, the Engineer company turned around and went back to camp. = Engineer attack = The next morning, September 4, D Company received orders to move immediately as an infantry force to Ka-san. The company carried no rations since E Company, 8th Cavalry, was to bring food and water later. The engineer troops arrived at their assembly area near the village of Kisong- dong east of the Tabu-dong road, where Holley set up a communications command post. Sniper fire came in on the men as they moved up the trail to the base of Ka-san's steep slope. Word was given to the company that there were about 75 disorganized KPA troops on Ka-san. But actually, during the afternoon and evening of September 3, the KPA 2nd Battalion, 2nd Regiment, 1st Division, had occupied the summit of Ka-san. The engineer company started its attack up the mountain about noon of September 4, following a trail up a southern spur. The 1st Platoon was in the lead, single file, followed by the 2nd and 3rd Platoons. Palmer considered the mission so important that he and his military intelligence officer, Captain Rene J. Guiraud, accompanied the engineers. Platoon Sergeant James N. Vandygriff, 2nd Platoon, D Company, in a brief conversation with Holley as he went ahead of the latter on his way up the trail, said he thought the attack was a \\"suicide mission\\". Less than up the trail, D Company came under machine gun fire from its right flank, which inflicted several casualties. Kennedy rejected Vandygriff's request to take a squad and knock out the gun, so the file got past the line of fire as best it could until M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle fire from the 3rd Platoon silenced the weapon. Farther up the trail another KPA machine gun fired from the right along the trail and held up the advance until US artillery fire silenced it. The file of men left the trail-like road, which dead-ended, dropped over into a ravine on the left, and continued the climb. KPA mortar fire killed two men and wounded eight or ten others in this phase of the ascent. At this time the 2nd Platoon leader collapsed from a kidney ailment and command passed to Vandygriff. Vandygriff led his platoon, now at the head of the company, on up the gully and at about 17:00, came through a tunnel under a small ridge and the stone wall into the bowl-shaped summit of Hill 755, the southern arm of the Hill 902 crest. The 2nd and 3rd Platoons soon arrived, in that order. Near the top, Palmer received radio orders from Gay to come off the mountain; Gay had not known that Palmer had accompanied the attack. = Defense of Ka-san = Kennedy placed the 90 men of his company in position facing in an arc from west to northeast; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall, the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll, and the 3rd Platoon the right flank at the edge of a woods. Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three KPA mortars fire from away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where he wanted them to take position at the edge of the woods facing the KPA mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at the edge of the woods. They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued on toward the narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to the edge of the woods and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged KPA soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming down the narrow ridge toward them from the mortar position. This group was a security force for the mortars and they dropped to the ground about one-third of the way down the ridge. Jones decided to bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a messenger he had sent to bring back that last squad, KPA attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought that KPA had moved in force to the wooded bowl between him and the rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He and the rest of the platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left. That night Jones and the eight men with him stayed in the ravine just under the crest. Without his radio he could not communicate with the rest of the company which he thought had been destroyed or driven off the hill. The next day when American fighter planes strafed the hilltop it confirmed his belief that no D Company men were there. Some of the men in the advanced squad made their way back to US lines, but the KPA captured Jones and the eight men with him near the bottom of Ka-san on September 10 as they were trying to make their way through the KPA lines. This account of the 3rd Platoon explains why, except for the 3d Squad which rejoined D Company that evening, it was out of the action and off the crest almost as soon as it arrived on top, unknown to Kennedy and the rest of the company at the time. = North Koreans hit Hill 755 = About 30 minutes after D Company had reached Hill 755, an estimated KPA battalion launched an attack down the slope running south to Hill 755 from the crest of Hill 902. The main attack hit Vandygriff's 2nd Platoon just after Vandygriff had set up and loaded his two machine guns. These machine guns and the protection of the wall on its left enabled D Company to turn back this attack, which left one dead and three wounded in the 2nd Platoon. That night, KPA mortar and small arms fire harassed the company and there were several small probing attacks. Having no communication with the 3rd Platoon, Kennedy sent a patrol to its supposed position. The patrol reported back that it could find no one there but had found the platoon's rocket launchers and two light machine guns. D Company's defensive lines atop Hill 755. At dawn on September 5 the KPA attacked. The engineers repulsed this attack but suffered some casualties. KPA fire destroyed Vandygriff's radio, forcing him to use runners to communicate with Kennedy's command post. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft came over the area to make an airdrop. Kennedy put out orange identification panels, but the KPA put out similar panels. The planes circled, and finally dropped their bundles of ammunition and food on the KPA positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company. The KPA panels had misled both the cargo and fighter planes. The fighters dropped two napalm tanks within D Company's perimeter, but none there were injured. The planes then strafed right through the 2nd Platoon position, but again caused no casualties. Soon after this aerial attack, KPA troops attacked the positions, and PPSh-41 \\"burp gun\\" fire wounded Kennedy in the leg and ankle. Sometime between 10:00 and 11:00 the advanced platoon of E Company, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived on top of Hill 755 and came into D Company's perimeter. Some of the engineers fired on the E Company men before the latter identified themselves. The E Company platoon went into position on the right of Vandygriff, and Kennedy turned over command of the combined force to the E Company commander. Kennedy then assembled 12 wounded men and started down the mountain with them. The party was under small arms fire most of the way. A carrying party of Korean A-frame porters led by an American officer had started up the mountain during the morning with supplies. KPA fire, killing several of the porters, turned it back. The day before, E Company had been delayed in following D Company to Hill 755. Soon after the Engineer company had started up the trail on September 4, E Company arrived at Holley's command post at the base of the mountain. KPA mortar fire was falling on the trail at the time and the company commander said he could not advance because of it. Holley radioed this information to Palmer who designated another company commander. This second officer was soon wounded in the leg and Holley then designated a third officer, who started up the mountain with E Company that evening about 20:00. KPA fire stopped the company short of the crest before dawn. It was this same company that the KPA 13th Division had cut off when it launched its attack the evening of September 2 and overran the 2nd Battalion north of Tabu-dong. Tired and dispirited from this experience and their roundabout journey to rejoin the regiment, E Company men were suffering from lowered morale. Shortly after the E Company platoon joined Vandygriff, the KPA attacked again. The E Company infantrymen had brought no mortars with them-only small arms. In this situation, Vandygriff took a 3.5-inch rocket launcher and fired into the KPA attackers, causing them to break off the attack. By now Vandygriff's troops were nearly out of ammunition. He then instructed his men to gather up all the weapons and ammunition from KPA dead they could reach, and in this manner they obtained for emergency use about 30 to 40 rifles, 5 PPSh-41 guns, and some hand grenades. In the course of gathering up these weapons, Vandygriff passed the dug-in position of Private First Class Melvin L. Brown, a BAR man in the 3rd Squad. Brown was next to the wall on the extreme left of the platoon position at a point where the wall was only about high. At the bottom of the wall around Brown's position lay 15 to 20 KPA dead. Earlier in the day, about 08:00, Kennedy had visited Brown and had seen five KPA dead that Brown had killed with BAR fire. Subsequently, Brown exhausted his automatic rifle ammunition, then his few grenades, and finally he used his entrenching tool to knock the KPA in the head when they tried to climb over the wall. Brown had been slightly wounded in the shoulder early in the morning, but had bandaged it himself and refused to leave his position. = Evacuation of Ka-san = Melvin Brown, killed at Ka-san, who would later receive the Medal of Honor for his actions there At 13:30 Gay ordered the 8th Cavalry Regiment to withdraw its men off Ka-san. Gay believed he had insufficient forces to secure and hold it and that the KPA had insufficient ammunition to exploit its possession as an observation point for directing artillery and mortar fire. However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion. Rain started falling again and heavy fog closed in on the mountain top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the KPA attacked the 2nd Platoon and the adjacent E Company infantrymen. One of the engineers was shot through the neck and Vandygriff sent him to the company command post, only to have the man return to report that there was no longer a command post, that he could not find anyone and had seen only KPA dead. Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw. As Vandygriff and his men began pulling back from the mountain, KPA fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started to break up the weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they discovered Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down. At the base of the mountain, Holley and others in the afternoon saw E Company men come down from the top and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action. = KPA consolidation = Soldiers of the ROK 1st Division captured a KPA soldier near Ka-san on September 4 who said that about 800 KPA soldiers were on Ka-san with three more battalions following them from the north. The engineer company had succeeded only in establishing a perimeter briefly within the KPA-held area. By evening of September 5, Ka-san was securely in KPA hands with an estimated five battalions, totaling about 1,500 soldiers, on the mountain and its forward slope. A KPA oxtrain carrying 82-mm. mortar shells and rice reportedly reached the top of Ka-san during the day. The ROK 1st Division captured this oxtrain a few days later south of Ka-san. By September 10, 400-500 KPA were on the ridge of Ka-San, as observed by a T-6 Mosquito spotter plane. Now, with Ka-san firmly in their possession, the KPA 13th and 1st Divisions made ready to press on downhill into Taegu. On September 6, the day after the US troops were driven off Ka-san, a KPA force established a roadblock below Tabu-dong and other units occupied Hill 570, southwest of Ka-san and overlooking the Taegu road from the east side. The next morning five tanks of the 16th Reconnaissance Company prepared to lead an attack against the roadblock. The KPA troops were in a rice field west and on the hills east of the road. Gay personally observed the action. The tank attack speedily disposed of the KPA in the rice field, but the US infantry spent several hours clearing the hills on the east side of the road. KPA artillery during September 7 shelled batteries of the 9th and 99th Field Artillery Battalions, forcing displacement of two batteries during the day. US air strikes and artillery kept both Hills 902 and 570 under heavy attack. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division fell back nearly everywhere that day, Walker ordered it and the ROK II Corps to attack and seize Hill 902 and Ka-san. He directed the ROK 1st Division and the US 1st Cavalry Division to select a boundary between them and to maintain physical contact during the attack. On the morning of September 8, Lieutenant Colonel Harold K. Johnson's 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, after a withdrawal during the night from its former position, tried to drive the KPA from Hill 570. The three peaks of this mountain mass were under clouds, making it impossible to support the infantry attack with air strikes or artillery and mortar fire. Johnson placed all three of his companies in the assault against the three peaks; two of them reached their objectives, one with little opposition, the other caught KPA soldiers asleep on the ground. But KPA counterattacks regained this second peak. The main KPA force on Hill 570 was on the third and highest of the three peaks and held it firmly against the L Company attack. The I Company commander and the L Company executive officer were killed, as were several NCOs. An estimated 1,000 KPA soldiers were on Hill 570, north of Taegu, and on September 8, Walker decided the continued pressure against the eastern flank of the 1st Cavalry Division sector was the most immediate threat to the UN Forces at Pusan Perimeter. That same day, 8 September, the 1st Cavalry Division canceled a planned continuation of the attack against Hill 570 by the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, when KPA forces threatened Hills 314 and 660, south and east of 570. = Taegu threatened = In the midst of this drive on Taegu, an ammunition shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that UN Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. howitzer ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per howitzer per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition. The KPA 1st Division now began moving in the zone of the ROK 1st Division around the right flank of the 1st Cavalry Division. Its 2nd Regiment, with 1,200 men, advanced eastward from the vicinity of Hill 902 to the towering mountain of P'algong-san. It reached the top of P'algong-san about daylight on September 10, and a little later new replacements made a charge toward the ROK positions. The ROK repulsed the charge, killing or wounding about two-thirds of the attacking force. The US 1st Cavalry Division now had most of its combat units concentrated on its right flank north of Taegu. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, attached to the 8th Cavalry Regiment, was behind that regiment on Hills 181 and 182 astride the Tabu-dong road only north of Taegu. The rest of the 7th Cavalry Regiment (the 1st Battalion rejoined the regiment during the day) was in the valley of the Kumho River to the right rear between the KPA and the Taegu Airfield, which was situated northeast of the city. The US 5th Cavalry Regiment was disposed on the hills astride the Waegwan road northwest of Taegu. On its left the entire 8th Engineer Combat Battalion was in line as infantry, with the mission of holding a bridge across the Kumho River near its juncture with the Naktong River east of Taegu. The fighting north of Taegu on September 11 in the vicinity of Hills 660 and 314 was heavy and confused. For a time, the 1st Cavalry Division feared a breakthrough to the blocking position of the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry. The rifle companies of the division were now very low in strength. Johnson stated later that any company of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, that had 100 men during this period was his assault company for the day. = Hill 314 = While the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, again vainly attacked Hill 570 on September 11, KPA soldiers seized the crest of Hill 314 southeast of it and that much closer to Taegu. Actually, the two hill masses are adjacent and their lower slopes within small arms range of each other. The KPA drove the 16th Reconnaissance Company from the hill and only the ROK 5th Training Battalion, previously hurried into the line from Taegu in a supporting position, prevented the KPA from gaining complete control of this terrain feature. This ROK battalion still held part of the reverse slope of Hill 314 when the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, hurried to the scene from its attacks on Hill 570 and tried to retake the position. The ROK battalion twice had attacked and reached the crest but could not hold it, and had dug in on the lower southern slopes. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, command post had to fight off infiltrating KPA on September 12 as it issued its attack order and prepared to attack through the 8th Cavalry lines against Hill 314. This attack on the 12th was to be part of a larger US and ROK counterattack against the KPA 13th and 1st Divisions in an effort to halt them north of Taegu. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, relieved the ROK units on Hill 660, east of Hill 314, and had the mission of securing that hill. Farther east the ROK 1st Division had the mission of attacking from P'algong-san toward Ka- san. The point nearest Taegu occupied by KPA forces at this time was Hill 314. The KPA 13th Division valued its possession and had concentrated about 700 soldiers on it. The KPA intended to use Hill 314 in making the next advance on Taegu. From it, observation reached to Taegu and it commanded the lesser hills southward rimming the Taegu bowl. Hill 314 is actually the southern knob of a hill mass which lies close to the east side of Hill 570 and is separated from that hill mass only by a deep gulch. The southern point rises to and the ridge line climbs northward from it in a series of knobs. The ridge line is in length, and all sides of the hill mass are very steep. Lieutenant Colonel James H. Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, on the eve of its attack against Hill 314 numbered 535 men, less its rear echelons. The battalion had arrived in Korea at the end of August. The action of the 7th Cavalry at Hill 518, begun nine days earlier, had been its first action, and attacking Hill 314 would be its second. The battalion attack plan this time differed radically from that employed against Hill 518 and was a direct development of that failure. The key aspect of the Hill 314 attack plan was to mass as many riflemen as possible on top of the narrow ridge line, by attacking with two companies abreast along the ridge, as opposed to Hill 518, where the firepower of only a platoon, and at times of only a squad, could be brought to bear against the KPA. Because of the ammunition shortage there was no artillery preparation on Hill 314, but there was an air strike before Lynch's battalion, with L Company on the left and I Company on the right started its attack from the lower slopes at 11:00 on September 12. KPA 120-mm. mortar fire was already falling on battalion as it moved out. For it encountered only sporadic small arms and machine gun fire; then KPA rifle fire became intense and preregistered mortar fire came down on the troops, slowing the advance. On the left, men in L Company could see approximately 400 KPA preparing to counterattack. They radioed for an air strike but the designated planes were on the ground refueling. The troops were still able to repulse the counterattack with combined artillery, mortar, and small arms fire. The air strike came in at 14:00, blanketing the top and the north slope of the ridge. By this time KPA mortar fire had caused many casualties, and elements of L and I Companies became intermingled. But, in contrast to the action on Hill 518, the men continued the attack largely of their own volition after many of the officers had become casualties. Many of the officers in the companies were wounded but refused evacuation and simply continued the attack. Fifteen minutes after the air strike, the 3rd Battalion resumed its attack toward the crest. As it neared it the KPA came out of their positions in a violent counterattack and engaged at close quarters. Some men gained the crest but KPA mortar and machine gun fire drove them off. They reached it a second time but could not hold it. Another air strike hit the KPA. Then, a third time, the company commander led his men to the top. The men scrambled up a 60-degree slope for the last stretch to the top, where they closed with the KPA and overran their positions. The remaining men of the two US companies secured the hill and then reorganized jointly. There were fewer than 40 effectives left in L Company and about 40 in I Company; the latter had lost all its officers. Gay caused a special study to be made of this action because he considered it so outstanding. He found that the 3d Battalion suffered 229 battle casualties in the first two hours. Of these, 38 troops were killed and 167 wounded, the remainder were Korean Augmentation To the United States Army. The battalion aid station reported treating 130 casualties. Other wounded were treated at the 8th Cavalry aid station. Many men with minor wounds did not ask for medical attention until the battle had ended, and there were only five cases of combat shock in contrast to the eighteen on Hill 518. KPA mortar fire caused 80 percent of the casualties. The battalion held Hill 314 for the next six days and gathered up a large amount of KPA equipment and ammunition. The KPA soldiers on Hill 314 wore US uniforms, helmets and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 KPA dead were on the hill. Of the other 500 estimated to have been there, most of them had been wounded or were missing. Several war crimes committed by the KPA came to light during the action on Hill 314. On September 12 while the final action on the hill was taking place, troops discovered an American officer who had been bound, gasoline poured over him, and burned. Two days later members of the battalion found on the hill the bodies of four other American soldiers with their hands tied. The bodies bore evidence that the men had been bayoneted and shot while bound. = Final moves = After the capture of Hill 314 on September 12, the situation north of Taegu improved. On September 14 the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked and, supported by fire from Hill 314, gained part of Hill 570 from the KPA 19th Regiment, 13th Division. Across the army boundary on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and advanced to the edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and KPA troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong- san. Prisoners taken by the ROK's estimated that there were about 800 KPA on this high ridge. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 KPA were inside Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the KPA 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications were that the KPA 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 KPA troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close-in defense of Taegu. As part of this, fourteen battalions of South Korean police dug in around the city. The fighting continued unabated north of Taegu on the 15th. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, still fought to gain control of Hill 570 on the east side of the Tabu-dong highway. On the other side, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, attacked Hill 401 where a KPA force had penetrated in a gap between the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments. The fighting on Hill 401 was particularly severe. Both sides had troops on the mountain when night fell. = North Korean withdrawal = The UN counterattack at Inchon outflanked the KPA and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes. On September 16 Eighth Army began its Breakout from the Pusan Perimeter. On September 19 the UN discovered the KPA had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night, and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them. Most of the KPA units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea. The KPA withdrew from the Masan area first, the night of September 18‚Äì19. After the forces there, the remainder of the KPA withdrew rapidly to the North. The UN units rapidly pursued them north, passing over the Naktong River positions, which were no longer of strategic importance.  Aftermath  The KPA 13th and 1st Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles. The 1st Division had numbered 5,000 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1. The 13th Division numbered 9,000. Only 2,000 men from the 1st Division were able to retreat back into North Korea by October. The majority of the division's troops had been killed, captured or deserted. The KPA 13th Division, however, was completely annihilated. Only a few isolated pockets of its men were known to have made it back to North Korea. Most of the division's officers, including its artillery commander, division surgeon, the chief of staff, and two of the three regimental commanders. When the KPA 19th Regiment surrendered in Tanyang, it had only 167 men. No more than a few hundred of the original 9,000 returned to North Korea. All of KPA II Corps was in a similar state, and the KPA was on the brink of defeat. By this time, the US 1st Cavalry Division suffered 770 killed, 2,613 wounded, 62 captured during its time at Pusan Perimeter. This included about 600 casualties, with around 200 killed in action it had already suffered during the Battle of Taegu the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the KPA from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 14,703 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. South Korean casualties at the battle were difficult to predict, but also thought to be heavy. The ROK 1st Division had numbered 10,482 men September 1.

History  Between 1840 and 1856, nearly 4 million tons of salt were extracted from the lake. Following the 1856 Treaty of Paris (1856), settled the Crimean War (1853-1856), Russia had to return to Moldova a strip of land from southwest Bessarabia (known as Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail). As a result of this territorial loss, Russia had no access to the mouths of the Danube, and the exploitation of the salt was stopped. Following the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Romania was forced to return Southern Bessarabia to Russia. After that, Russians did not resume the salt extraction from the lake.

It is located approximately southwest of Magdeburg, capital of the Bundesland Saxony-Anhalt, and about 190 km (118 miles) west from the center of Berlin.info As of 1 September 2016, the airport had been closed by the authorities and sold as a testing facility to the German Aerospace Center in 2019. History The airport Cochstedt dates from the year 1957, when an air force base of the Soviet troops was established. In 1968, the runway extension was completed and airport logistics operation expanded. After German reunification and the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the first steps for continued existence as a civil airport were taken. On 26 May 1994 the airport was given an operating license as a commercial airport with class D airspace and full day and night operation. From November 1997 until early 1999 the operations were suspended due to a complete refurbishment of the airport, including runway, apron, taxiways, control tower. In June 2000, an instrument landing system (ILS) Category I and a high-performance approach lights were put into operation allowing the operation under instrument flying rules. In the summer of 2001 a new fire station was put into operation and the construction of a new terminal building for the General Aviation (\\"GAT\\") started. However, before works were completed, on 31 December 2001 operation was suspended due to insolvency of the airport operator. On behalf of the state of Saxony-Anhalt GSA acquired all assets from the bankrupt estate. The new operating company FMC mbH was founded in 2005 jointly with the Landkreis Aschersleben-Sta√üfurt. On 4 March 2010 the airport was acquired by the Danish company Development A/S.

Nelson clearly thought highly of Atkinson, describing him as \\"One of the best Masters I have seen in the Royal Navy\\". Early career and promotion to master Born in Yorkshire in 1767, Atkinson joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer in 1793. Virtually nothing is known of him before this date but as he was immediately rated as an able seaman it is almost certain that he was already an experienced mariner. He was promoted to master two years later and joined , a 36-gun frigate. In the spring of 1797 he transferred to which soon after became Nelson's flagship. It was here Atkinson first came to the admiral's attention, serving under him during the unsuccessful expedition of 1797 against Santa Cruz de Tenerife. HMS Theseus and the Battle of the Nile While serving on board Theseus, Atkinson also saw action at Aboukir Bay in 1798 and Acre in 1799, when he was wounded in an explosion that damaged the ship and killed the captain, Ralph Miller. Atkinson was mentioned by Sir Sidney Smith in despatches, later published in the London Gazette, for his bravery in having contributed to the success of the battle and, along with other officers, saving the ship after Captain Miller was killed. Service under Nelson In 1801, Atkinson joined Nelson's new flagship, , and began an almost uninterrupted spell of service under the admiral. During the first Baltic campaign (1801), when Nelson transferred his flag to , Atkinson went with him and was one of those who marked out the treacherous shoals around Copenhagen prior to the battle. This action gained him his first testimonial from Nelson who also became godfather to one of Atkinson's sons. =HMS Victory and Trafalgar= When war again broke out in 1803, Nelson wrote to Atkinson personally asking him to serve as master in . They served together until Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. At Nelson's funeral in 1806 Atkinson was present in the third barge. He was the only non- commissioned officer to be given that honour. Atkinson also accompanied the funeral car during the procession. A diagram was published in the London Gazette.
