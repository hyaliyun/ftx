Her writing was described by Madeleine Kingsley of the Jewish Chronicle as \\"depicting the parts of human nature that are oblique, suppressed and rarely voiced\\".  Early life  Christine Dwyer Hickey was born in Dublin in 1958. She is an only girl of four siblings. After her parents' marriage broke up, her father became the chief carer of a somewhat chaotic family life. When Hickey was ten years old, she went to Mount Sackville Boarding school. She described her years there as a time of stability and creativity. Her childhood has informed some of her work particularly Tatty, a story of a marriage breakup from the child‚Äôs point of view. It was described in a review published by Independent News & Media as a novel that is both \\"harrowing\\" and \\"immensely funny\\", one that \\"does not preach about the horrors of alcoholism [but] allows the reader to experience at first hand the confusion, hurt and despair the children of alcoholic parents suffer\\". As a child she spent much time with her father and often went to the races with him. She used this experience in her 1991 short story, Across the Excellent Grass which won the Powers Gold Short Story Competition at Listowel Writers‚Äô Week. She won the same competition the following year with Bridie‚Äôs Wedding and was also a prize winner in The Observer/short story competition with Teatro La Fenice. Work The Dublin Trilogy was published between 1995-2000 as The Dancer, The Gambler and The Gatemaker by Marino Books and was republished by New Island in 2006-07. The trilogy is the story of a Dublin family between the years 1913-1958. Hickey published Tatty in 2004 followed in 2009 by the Last Train from Liguria, set in Italy during the fascist era and 1990s Dublin. The Cold Eye of Heaven was published by Atlantic UK in 2011 and in the US by Dalkey Archive. A short story collection, The House on Parkgate Street and other Dublin stories was published in 2012 and Snow Angels, a play, was published in 2014 following its run at the Project Arts Theatre. Hickey's novel The Cold Eye of Heaven won the Kerry Group Irish Fiction Award in 2012, was nominated for the 2013 International Dublin Literary Award, and shortlisted at the 2011 Irish Book Awards for novel of the year. Her novels have also been nominated for the Orange Prize, the Prix Europ√©en de Litt√©rature, the 50 Best Books of the Decade and the Hughes & Hughes Novel of the Year. Her short stories have won several awards, most recently the Writing.ie Short Story Award for Back to Bones which was also longlisted for The EFG Sunday Times Short Story Competition 2017. The Lives of Women was published in 2015 and in the US in 2018. Tatty has been chosen as the Dublin: One City One Book for 2020. She is an elected member of Aosdana, the Irish Academy of Arts Hickey has cited James Joyce and Virginia Woolf as her writing influences. A review in the Irish Times compared her short stories to Joyce's Dubliners, and the poet John Montague has likened her work to that of Katherine Mansfield.

The program was founded in 1992 by James Boggs, Grace Lee Boggs, Shea Howell, and others. This also coincided with the founding of the Boggs Center.  Background  In response to Detroit Mayor Coleman Young's plan for casinos to revitalize the city's declining economics, James Boggs and Grace Lee Boggs attempted to recreate the effects of the Mississippi Summer by recreating a similar program for youth in Detroit. In an interview, Grace Lee Boggs recounts being influenced by Martin Luther King, Jr., \\"He proposed that young people ‚Äòin our dying cities‚Äô needed programs that were designed to change themselves and their society.\\" The goal of Detroit Summer was to develop a program where area youth could learn to become leaders to help shape the city's future. Boggs recounted, \\"our hope was that Detroit Summer would bring about a new vision and model of community activism- one that was particularly responsive to the new challenges posed by the conditions of life and struggle in the post-industrial city.\\" For Grace Lee Boggs, Detroit Summer was to be a space where local youth could learn through practice and through engaging with others from different generations of activists and educators. It was intended to be a small-scale, independent organization sustained through participant engagement. = Activities = Teens and volunteers involved in Detroit Summer participate in numerous activities from street cleaning, urban gardening, recycling waste, repurposing abandoned lots, repairing homes, education and outreach, and creating and coordinating public art in areas designated as \\"urban blight.\\" Many also gain work experience working with local initiatives and community-based enterprises, such as the Back Alley Bikes shop. Participants gain manual skills, recycle post-consumer waste, and conduct outreach and education with the community. Youth organizers with Detroit Summer also attend the Allied Media Conference, now held annually in Detroit, where they interact with community organizers, media activists, educators, and scholars. Many will organize panels, attend sessions and workshops, and create community-oriented media. Public art projects engages school age children in efforts to beautify Detroit communities and imagine possible hopeful futures. These projects encourage youth to develop positive feelings towards their communities.  Legacy  The success of Detroit Summer led to the formation of additional local youth groups including Back Alley Bikes, a youth bicycle collective, Detroit Future, and the Detroit Asian Youth Project. Alumni of Detroit Summer have gone on to take up leadership roles with Detroit Summer, the Boggs Center, and to affect change in education, media, art, policy, urban planning, and the larger local community in Detroit. The James & Grace Lee Boggs School, a community-based charter school for K-8, grew out of Detroit Summer and its curriculum is informed by the empowering educational philosophies practiced by the founders and organizers of Detroit Summer. According to professor of geography, Rachael Baker, \\"What is arguably [Grace Lee Boggs'] most lasting contribution to critical engagement with racialization and property relations is the work Grace carried out with her husband Jimmy in the Detroit Summer program; an initiative that gave Grace‚Äôs pedagogy life and am urban scale of influence that continues to live on in the urban fabric of civic activism in Detroit today.\\" = Notable participants = * Julia Putnam, one of the first teens enrolled in Detroit Summer, would later go on to become the principal for the James and Grace Lee Boggs School. * Jenny Lee, participated with Detroit Summer, and later joined the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition and became the Executive Director of Allied Media Projects, which hosts the Allied Media Conference annually. = Related organizations = * Detroit Future Schools * Detroit City of Hope * The James & Grace Lee Boggs School * 5E Gallery * Field Street Work Collective * Freedom Growers  References   External links  * Official Website * Official site for the James & Grace Lee Boggs School Youth Youth organizations Community organizations Community-building organizations Urban renewal Organizations based in Detroit Organizations based in the United States Organizations established in the 20th century ","title":"Detroit Summer"},{"id":"58337660","text":"Forlagshuset Vigmostad & Bj√∏rke is the fourth largest publishing house in Norway..

They have mainly played against regional rivals Argentina, playing against them 29 times between 1868 and World War II, winning on six occasions. In 2018, the team finished second place in the annual South American Cricket Championship hosted in Colombia.  History  The Victoria Cricket Club was established as far back as 1842. Far away from home, in distant Montevideo, the expatriate Englishmen had yearned to play the familiar sports of their land. Hence, the local Uruguayans passing by often saw the foreigners indulging in the strange game of willow and leather. In 1861, the Victoria Cricket Club was re-established as the Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC), and like any other Latin American cricket club, it branched into rugby, football, and gradually field hockey and tennis. In the World Rugby Museum of Twickenham, MVCC is listed as the eighth oldest rugby union club in the world, the oldest outside Europe. Cricket did maintain a toehold as well. In 1868, the Montevideo Cricket Club played against Argentina‚Äôs Buenos Aires Cricket Club in their home ground La Blanqueda, marking the first international match in South America. Ten years later, the club took on the crew of a visiting vessel in a football game ‚Äî the first such match played in the land. And with that cricket took a backseat in the country. However, cricket teams of Montevideo ‚Äî formed by appending a few players to the Montevideo Cricket Club ‚Äî did take part in two matches against English sides. The first was played at the Blanqueda ground over two days during the festival period in 1926, against a reasonably strong Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side. A figure as notable as Plum Warner led the team. Although 53 at that time, he was after all a former England captain. The team was loaded with experienced First-Class cricketers. Gubby Allen sat out for the match against Montevideo, but there was the England left-arm spinner Jack White and his guile was a bit too much for the local batsmen to handle. MCC batted first and Irish-born Hampshire batsman Tom Jameson notched up a hundred. Guy Jackson of Derbyshire and Warner hit half centuries before the innings was closed at 366 for seven. Not all the bowlers were butchered, though. The impressive medium pacer HL Pennock picked up five for 107. In response, Montevideo‚Äôs innings lasted only 19.3 overs. White was too classy for the local talent and only Pennock managed to enter double figures by scoring 12. White‚Äôs figures read seven for 27 in 9.3 overs and the total stuttered and stumbled to reach 64. In the second innings, the home side did little better. Jameson, now enjoying himself with the ball, picked up five wickets. A lot of the bowling was also done by Lord Dunglass, the least accomplished cricketer of the side. But this minor cricketer, who answered to the full name Alec Douglas Home and later became the Prime Minister of Britain, captured four wickets. The hosts folded for just 98 on Christmas Day. The next major match for the Montevideo side was played in January 1938 on the same Blanqueda ground. It was against a strong English side led by Sir Theodore Brickman. The team boasted several big names ‚Äì including celebrated ageing stalwarts like Andy Sandham and RES Wyatt, as well as other Test stars like Jim Sims, Arthur Wood, Jack Durston and Fred Price. However, the home bowlers did an appreciable job in restricting the visiting batsmen. Fifties by Wyatt and the Warwickshire veteran Reg Santall helped to take Sir Theodore Brickman‚Äôs XI to 280. Pennock, still going strong after 11 years, captured three wickets. The bowlers were helped along by some cavalier batting as well, and the runs were plundered in just 36overs. However, the batting of the home side was too brittle to capitalise on the good work. Eddie Watts, the Surrey teammate of Alf Gover and also his brother- in-law, ran through the batting with able help from Wyatt and the occasional fare of Sandham. The 80 runs that the home side scored came in just 11 overs. It was fireworks all around. In the second innings, Wyatt plundered 187, with minor counties batsman Harold Dods blasting another hundred. As many as 411 runs were amassed in just 50.1 overs before Sir Brickman declared the innings. Poor Pennock gave away 106 runs in nine overs, although he had the consolation of accounting for Wyatt and Watts. With the target a staggering 600, the hosts surrendered to Jim Sims whose legbreaks bamboozled seven batsmen in the space of eight overs. In a curious coincidence, Sims finished with seven for 27, the same figures Jack White had achieved 11 years earlier. The hosts were skittled for 124, losing by 475 runs. Since then, the cricketers of Uruguay have never really played against a major cricketing power. Even in the South American scene, they have been left far behind by Argentina. =Indian cricketers in Uruguay= Many workers at Tata Consultancy Services are native Indians and play cricket; so, the Uruguayan national cricket team is revealingly made up of South Asians.

Due to its hyperelastic properties, it is capable of bouncing back high-speed ballistic projectiles as if the material had ‚Äúhardened‚Äù upon impact. PUUs were developed by researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and the Army‚Äôs Institute for Soldier Nanotechnology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to potentially replace polyethylene materials in body armor and other protective gear, such as combat helmets, face shields, and ballistic vests.  Composition  In general, PUUs are composed of both hard and soft segments that each play a role in the material‚Äôs physical properties. The soft segments consist of two types of chemical compounds, long-chain polyols and diisocyanates, that react and connect together with urethane linkages. On the other hand, the short-chain diamines react with the diisocyanates to form the hard segments that are held together with urea linkages. The mechanical properties of the PUU largely depend on the specific diisocyanates, long-chain polyols, and short-chain diamines in play, because how these components interact determines how well the soft and hard segments of the elastomers both crystallize and undergo microphase separation. As a result, variations in this molecular arrangement of chemical compounds have been shown to greatly affect the elastomer‚Äôs morphology and the macroscopic, mechanical properties that it exhibits.  Hyperelastic Behavior  In 2017, researchers from the Army Research Laboratory and MIT reported that PUUs are capable of demonstrating hyperelastic properties, meaning that the material becomes extremely hardened upon being deformed within a very short time. As a result, the material may withstand ballistic impacts at exceptionally high speeds. For the study, the researchers investigated the performance of different PUU variants where 4,4‚Äô-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate (HMDI) was chosen as the diisocyanate compound, diethyltoluenediamine (DETA) was chosen as the short-chain diamine compound, and poly(tetramethyleneoxide) (PTMO) was chosen as the long-chain polyol compound. Despite consisting of the same chemical compounds with the same stoichiometric ratio of 2:1:1 of [HDMI]:[DETA]:[PTMO], the samples differed regarding the molecular weight of their respective PTMO component, namely 650 g/mol, 1000 g/mol, and 2000 g/mol, for the soft segments of the elastomers. Each of the three samples were subjected to a laser-induced projectile impact test (LIPIT), which tested the dynamic response of the material by using a pulsed laser to shoot it with microparticles made of silica at speeds ranging from 200 m/s to 800 m/s. The researchers found that the sample with the 650 g/mol PTMO was the most rigid variant with the particle exhibiting a shallow penetration of about 4 micrometers upon impact despite travelling at 790 m/s before rebounding at 195 m/s. In contrast, the sample with the 2000 g/mol PTMO displayed a deeper penetration of about 9 micrometers but had a slower particle rebound of 80 m/s, making it the most rubber-like among the PUU samples. The strain-rates associated with these impacts were on the order of 2.0 x 10^8/s for the former and 8.1 x 10^7/s for the latter. However, all three PUU variants demonstrated rebound capabilities with no signs of post-mortem damage after impact from the microparticles. In contrast, when the LIPIT was performed on a ductile, glassy polycarbonate at similar speeds to that of the 650 g/mol PTMO PUU variant, the polycarbonate displayed predominant deformation upon impact, despite its high fracture toughness and ballistic strength. According to the researchers, the effectiveness of the PUUs may come from how the molecules ‚Äúresonate‚Äù similar to chain-mail upon impact with each oscillations at specific frequencies dissipate the absorbed energy. In comparison, the polycarbonate lacked the broad range of relaxation times, a characteristic that reflects how efficiently the molecules in the polymer chains respond to an external impulse, that PUUs are known to have. As a result, the researchers concluded that even the most rubber-like variant of the PUU, specifically the 2000 g/mol PTMO sample, demonstrated greater robustness and dynamic stiffening than the glassy polycarbonate. ARL researchers have stated that the PUU‚Äôs primary benefit comes not from its extra strength but its fabric-like flexibility, which demonstrates its potential as a replacement material for the rigid ceramic and metal plates generally found in military battle armor. However, as of 2018, the PUU is still under development in the testing phase.

It was constituted in 2013, following the national administrative reform, through aggregation of the civil parishes of and Vera Cruz, resulting a cumulative population of 18756 inhabitants dispersed through a total area of . History Since the Christian Reconquista and reorganization of the church between the Douro and Mondego Rivers, the settlements of Aveiro were constituted in one parish, whose seat was the Church of S√£o Miguel. Constructed at the end of the 9th century, under the initiative of D. Sisnando, Count of Coimbra and vassal of D. Fernando Magno, King of Leon, the first building was erected on a hill where a fortification and mosque had likely existed. Overlooking the sea, which entered and formed a long bay with several arms the incipient \\"Alav√°rio\\" was an outpost of the Conimbricense facing the north. Surrounding it, in the middle of the 10th century, the Countess Mumadona Dias had lands and saltworks, which she donated to the Monastery of Guimar√£es by 26 January 959. In the 16th century, the region of Aveiro was part of the Diocese de Coimbra, and extended north to the River Antu√£ that followed the Cambra, from Oliveira de Azem√©is and Estarreja. During this time, bishop D. Jo√£o Soares wanted to visit the parishes within his dominion and to prepare for his visit, ordered a census of the population in each. This study determined a population in Aveiro in 1572 of 11365 practicing Christians. The bishop realized that this number was an excessive population and determined to divide the main settlement into four parishes. Since the Church of S√£o Miguel was the dominion of the Order of S√£o Bento de Aviz, this division could not be possible without consulting with the king, who was the Grand-Master of the Order. Yet, this was a simple matter, since King D. Sebastian granted the bishop his writ. The prelate, by provision on 10 June 1572, parceled out the territory into the following parishes: S√£o Miguel, that included most of the walled town and the barrio of Alboi (to the west); Esp√≠rito Santo, that included the Convent of S√£o Domingos, Convent of Jesus and Convent of Santo Ant√≥nio, which extended to the south and encompassed Cimo da Vila, Vilar, S√£o Bernardo, Santiago and part of Presa and Quinta do Gato; Nossa Senhora das Candeias (or alternately Nossa Senhora da Apresenta√ß√£o) and Vera Cruz, to the north of the central channel. The parish of Apresenta√ß√£o included most of the Ria from the town to the central channel of Ovar (S√£o Jacinto) and Vera Cruz included the limits that befell the Convent of Carmo and Convent of S√°, and extended to Presa and Quinta do Gato. Following the division, the parish of S√£o Miguel included a population of 4500 inhabitants, while the other parishes each had 2500. At the beginning of the 19th century, the older divisions were reformed into districts in 1822, in order to establish administrative, judicial, political and civil control. The 1826 constitution maintained the project, but the 1833 reforms divided the national territory into eight provinces, with the comarca of Aveiro falling into the province of Douro. Yet, these divisions were inconvenient, owing to their extensive territories, and they were abolished in favour of a district and municipal system: on 18 July 1835, a decree was published to institute 10 district capitals. Following this, the district of Aveiro under the stewardship of Jos√© Joaquim Lopes de Lima (its first Civil Governor) reduced the number of parishes to two on 11 October 1835: to the north of the central Ria, Vera-Cruz and, to the south, Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria. The barrio of S√£ was incorporated into Vera-Cruz. Of the other parishes, Nossa Senhora da Apresenta√ß√£o was extinguished, S√£o Miguel and Esp√≠rito Santo were incorporated into the new Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria parish. The parochial church of Vera-Cruz continued to be the centre of the settlement, in the actual Largo Capit√£o Maia Magalh√£es; only decades later would their be interest in constructing a new church, but was demolished before being completed in 1945. The religious centre was transferred temporarily to the Church of Nossa Senhora da Apresenta√ß√£o, but remained the centre thereafter. Meanwhile, in the south, the parish was named \\"Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria\\", likely to honor Queen D. Maria da Gl√≥ria, and was the seat of the extinct Dominican Convent of Nossa Senhora da Miseric√≥rdia. Meanwhile, the Church of S√£o Miguel was sacrificed and demolished. The Civil Governor, petitioned by certain political forces, ordered its destruction in order that the people would have fewer remembrances of their former-Absolutist monarch; it was demolished in October 1835, a few days after the parish was extinguished. On 18 October (the day before the event) a procession ran through the burgh with the principal images to their resting place in the Church of S√£o Domingos. The act was preceded by a sermon where the orator sought to demonstrate that the church's destruction was not ordered in hate or scorn, and encouraged those present to accompany the cortege, and conform themselves to the authorities, progress and desires of the peoples of Aveiro. Regardless, there was sobbing and occasional cries from the witnesses during the speech and demolition. In comparison, the Church of Esp√≠rito Santo, in the Largo Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, was considered inutil and abandoned; it came as no surprise that in its state of ruin it was finally desecrated on 31 January 1836. As the images were also transported by procession to their final place in the church nearby. Following worries about its conservation, the municipal council of Aveiro, in accordance with the parish council ordered its demolish on 10 February 1858. The materials were then reused to construct the tower of the church of Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria. So that the October decision was legal and to facilitate the transition, the bishop of Aveiro ordered the passing of a new provision on 7 March 1836. It declared and validated that Father Manuel Rodrigues Tavares de Ara√∫jo Taborda would be named the parish priest of the parish of Vera-Cruz, owing to his 36-year ecclesiastical service to the extinguish parish of Nossa Senhora da Apresenta√ß√£o. Similarly, it conferred on Father Ant√≥nio Dias Ladeira de Castro the status of parish priest for Nossa Senhora da Gl√≥ria owing to his seven-year service at the Church of S√£o Miguel. In 2013, following the National administrative reform initiative, the two civil parishes were integrated into one agglomeration, representing the primary urban centre of the city of Aveiro, with its seat in Vera-Cruz.

It seeks to help African musicians break beyond the stigmas and prejudices of the term 'world music', while presenting a positive impression of Africa to counter against common media images of war, famine, and disease. Notable events that Africa Express has been involved in include performances at the 2012 Olympics, the Glastonbury Festival, the BBC Electric Proms, Denmark's Roskilde Festival, a tour of Syrian refugee musicians, and concerts in such places as Mali, the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, and France. The organization has also released a number of compilations and collaborative albums along with a documentary of the 2012 Africa Express UK train tour. Many of the established Western musicians who have participated in the organization's projects have spoken of their admiration for the musical skill levels of the African musicians involved and the influence their participation has had on them. Over 50,000 people are estimated to have attended Africa Express events, which have received substantial global media coverage.  History  Africa Express began out of a 2005 gathering in a Covent Garden bar where Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn along with other musicians and music industry friends were angered by the Live 8 charity concert for Africa's inclusion of only one African artist in its line up. Co- founding the organization with the journalist Ian Birrell, Africa Express's inaugural project featured Albarn and Birrell taking a number of Western musicians including Fatboy Slim, Martha Wainwright, and Jamie T, to perform at Festival au D√©sert in the Sahara outside of Timbuktu. In the early years of Africa Express, shows would be put on semi-spontaneously in locations such as Brixton pubs, with little to no advance announcement. The spirit of spontaneous collaborations between musicians of diverse cultures has carried on as the organization has grown to stage large scale events. In addition to Damon Albarn, frequent contributors to Africa Express's varied projects include Fela Kuti's drummer Tony Allen from Nigeria, Senegalese singer/guitarist Baaba Maal, the Malian duo Amadou & Mariam, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner, and The Magic Numbers' Romeo Stodart. Western musicians who've performed in the organizations events include Paul McCartney, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, Brian Eno, Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Scratch of The Roots, De La Soul, the Super Furry Animals' Gruff Rhys, Paul Weller, Martha Wainwright, Fatboy Slim, 3D of Massive Attack, The Smiths' Johnny Marr, Mick Jones and Paul Simonon of The Clash, Peter Hook of New Order/Joy Division, Terry Hall and Lynval Golding of The Specials, Carl Barat of The Libertines, Chicago's Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, Franz Ferdinand, Bjork, Elvis Costello, Django Django's David Maclean, Ghostpoet, David Wootton, Julia Holter, and numerous others. Alongside Tony Allen, Baaba Maal, and Amadou & Mariam, other African acts who have taken part in Africa Express projects include Nigerian Afrobeat star Femi Kuti, Algerian singer/activist Rachid Taha, Saharan blues group Tinariwen, Somali-Canadian rapper K'Naan, Malian acts such as singer/songwriter Rokia Traor√©, singer Fatoumata Diawara, kora player Toumani Diabat√©, Bassekou Kouyate, afro-pop artist Salif Keita, singer Oumou Sangar√©, and the desert blues duo Songhoy Blues from Timbuktu, Senegal's Wasis Diop and rap duo Daara J, the Mauritanian griot Noura Mint Seymali, the Congo's Jupiter Bokondji, and many more. In 2013, as a response to extremists banning music in the north of Mali, Albarn, Eno and others went to the country to collaborate and record with local musicians, with profits from the resultant Maison Des Jeunes album to be used to build a studio in Bamako. The group Songhoy Blues from Timbuktu were found living in a one room shack in Bamako during the trip and the release subsequently launched an international career for the act. In addition to expanding the Western audience for African music, Africa Express projects have also influenced the artistic output of the musicians taking part. The Red Hot Chili Peppers 2011 song Ethiopia was based on their member Flea's experiences in Ethiopia with Africa Express. Brian Eno, Django Django's David Maclean, and Franz Ferdinand's Alex Kapranos have also spoken of artistic outcomes arising from their involvement. In 2018, UK-based musicians Petite Noir and Nabihah Iqbal shared their contracts publicly after working on an Africa Express project in South Africa. The artists complained that the contracts saw all money raised from their work going to the organization with no future royalties to be paid out to them. Africa Express responded by explaining that on their projects, all travel, food, and accommodation costs are covered for the Western acts involved, who in turn are asked to donate their time and potential recording royalties arising from the completed work and that their contracts are negotiable. They state that the African artists involved are under different contracts where they are paid for their time, and that any profits arising go back into the artists and the promotion of African music. Africa Express Limited is registered at Companies House in the UK with the directors listed as Ian Birrell, Jason Walsh, Stephen Budd, Remi Kabaka Jr. (aka Russel Hobbs of Gorillaz) and Robin Aitken.

Early life Bertha was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 27, 1874. She was the daughter of William Alfred Perry (1835‚Äì1916) and Emma Constance (n√©e Frink) Perry (born 1848). Her brother was Henry Pierrepont Perry, who lived in the Bahamas and was married three times. His first marriage was to Edith Lounsberry (granddaughter of James Ben Ali Haggin), with whom he had William Haggin Perry, after their divorce, he married for the second time to Mary Ridgeley Sands, the former wife of Lorillard S. Spencer, and following her death, he married thirdly to Brenda Williams-Taylor, the daughter of Sir Frederick Williams-Taylor and mother of debutante Brenda Frazier. Her father, a graduate of Columbia College who was associated with the manufacture of steam pumps, was the son of Joseph Alfred Perry and Emily Constable (n√©e Pierrepont) Perry (the daughter of Hezekiah Pierrepont). Through her father, she was a descendant of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, known as the hero of the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812. Her maternal grandparents were Samuel Edgar Frink and Emma Virginia (n√©e Wood) Frink. Society life In 1892, Bertha and her widowed mother were included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. She was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. In December 1896, social arbiter Harry Lehr wrote in his diary that he \\"lunched with Bertha and Larry Ronalds, who is still boasting of being natural son of Napoleon III.\\" Her husband's parents had separated and her mother-in-law Fanny, was known for her association with Empress Eug√©nie, Queen Victoria and Queen Alexandra.The Times, August 3, 1916, p. 9 and many affairs with prominent men, including Leonard Jerome (Winston Churchill's grandfather) and the composer Arthur Sullivan.

Historian Michel Pastoureau says that the original purpose ofheraldic emblems and seals was to facilitate the exercise of power and the identification of the ruler, due to they offered for achieving these aims. These symbols were associated with the kingdom, and eventually also represented the intangible nature of the national sentiment or sense of belonging to a territory.Garc√≠a de Cort√°zar, J.A.; Sesma Mu√±oz, J.A. (1998) La Edad Media: una s√≠ntesis interpretativa [The Middle Ages: an interpretive synthesis]. Madrid: Alianza Editorial. P. 681. The blazon of the arms of Castile is:  Origin  The Royal Arms of Castile first adopted at the start of the age of heraldry (circa 1175), that spread across Europe during the next century.Thomas Woodcock & John Martin Robinson, The Oxford Guide to Heraldry, Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1. The Spanish heraldist Faustino Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s explained that there is no evidence that there was a consolidated Castilian emblem before the reign of King Alfonso VIII or these arms had pre-heraldic history as the heraldry of Le√≥n. Miniature depicting King Alfonso VIII of Castile, that adopted a castle as device, and his wife Eleanor of England The chancery of Alfonso VIII adopted a Signum Regis (seal) in 1165. This device had wheel shape, a defining characteristic of the chancery of monarchs of Castile since 1157. This author has pointed out that the emergence of the castle device Castile was similarly to the Leonese lion but at a much more accelerated pace. One of the earliest known testimonies that document the origin of the castle emblem was carried out by bishop Lucas de Tuy. In Castile, as it was common at that time, the first examples of the castle as heraldic symbols have been found at the reverse of pendent seals. The Signum Regis of King Alfonso VIII not always shown a castle. This monarch initially used a seal with a cross with pole. By the year 1163 was used a single side with an equestrian image of Alfonso VIII holding a lance without a standard, this element would have allowed us to determine the royal device used at that time. Following seals continued depicting equestrian images as central motif. The castle appeared for first time on the reverse of pendent seals. The first preserved seal impression with the castle dates from 1176, contained in a document located in the Toledo Cathedral. The matrix of this seal dates back before 1171 due to its typology. According Faustino Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s it is likelythat the device of the castle was adopted in 1169, when Alfonso VIII came of age at fourteen. As a clear example of canting arms, the castle was adopted with a clear territorial connotation. This decision could be motivated by a desire to claim the sovereignty of the Castilian monarch against the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Since from its inception the castle has retained a basic design - three towers, higher the central than lateral ones - leads to the conclusion that it is a native creation, different from the existing in Central Europe. Concerning the colours of the arms (tincture according to heraldry), it has been found that the combination ¬´Or on a Gules field¬ª, was already fixed at least since the reign of King Ferdinand III, called the Saint. This selection could be determined by the Heraldry of the consort of the King Alfonso VIII, Queen Eleanor of England, daughter of Henry II, King of England. The arms used by the Queen were the Royal Arms of England, three identical gold lions (also known as leopards) with blue tongues and claws, walking past but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background. Although the tincture azure of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England. These arms, which are one of the oldest heraldic emblems, have had much success at that time due to the ease which offered be easily recognisable at distance. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the marriage of Alfonso VIII and Eleanor was celebrated from 1170 to 1176, dates immediately prior to the adoption of the emblem according preserved sources. Faustino Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s defends as another possible reason for the choice of this combination of colors, for appearing more frequently in the arms. The selection of the third colour, shown in the door and windows, Azure (blue) could be due to the contrast with the other two, offering or that it was the third most commonly used colour after the previous. In the Reign of Alfonso VIII was usual that the castle emblem was presented as device and not in an escutcheon. We can be seen this device on the tomb of Alfonso VIII and Queen Eleanor, in the Abbey of Santa Mar√≠a la Real de Las Huelgas (Burgos). The grave is decorated with the device of the castle and the English arms shown in a shield. The Castle, as a device and not as part of an escutcheon, appears in all Castilian coins of the time. Castle devices placed in row have been found on two stoles embroidered by Queen Eleanor from 1197 to 1198. One of the first representations of the castle emblem in an escutcheon has been displayed on a green brocade removed from the tomb of King Alfonso VIII.

Despite this, the Royal Arms of Castile was spread though female lineage into royal insignia used in Portugal, Aragon and France. The Castilian arms were present in the heraldry of all the grandchildren of Alfonso VIII, except Kings Louis IX of France and Sancho II of Portugal that, as reigning monarchs, used their respective \\"arms of dominion\\". Castles Or on field Gules were included on the shields of the children of Louis VIII of France and Queen Blanche, also depicted on the tomb of other maternal grandson of Alfonso VIII, Infante Alfonso of Aragon (1222-1260), the eldest son of James I of Aragon and Queen Eleanor, decorated with the four paletts Gules and differenced with a bordure charged with twenty escutcheons Gules with castles. But one of the most prominent example occurred in Portugal, when Afonso III added a bordure Gules charged with castles to the royal arms and remaining these until 1910, when the country became a republic. Since 1911 the bordure with castles have continued as part of the national coat of arms of Portugal. A variant of the arms is adopted by Ceuta since its beginning of Portuguese rule, even though it was later handed over to Spain.

The King wanted to symbolize the union for the first time, quartering the Castilian and Leonese arms, giving the arms of Castile pride of place. His aim was to have a device that reflects an indivisible union of kingdoms due to of the transitory symbolism of the impalement and secondary of the bordure. This method, very widespread spread in the Heraldry of different countries, was soon followed successfully throughout Europe. In the middle of the 12th century quarterings were used by monarchs of Aragon-Sicily, Brabant and others like the Kings of England, Navarre or Bohemia adopted it during the next century. John I of Castile impaled the Castilian quartering with the arms of Portugal as pretender to the throne of that kingdom. The Royal Arms of Castile quartered with the Leonese ones were borne by the Castilian monarchs until the reign of the Catholic Monarchs. The quartering was remained as symbol associated with the Crown of Castile territory until the promulgation of the Nueva Planta decrees by Philip V in 1715.  Hispanic Monarchy and current uses  Coat of arms of the Catholic Monarchs giving the Castilian arms pride of place In 1475, Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon joined the arms of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon in a quarterly shield. It followed the method created by Fernando III and giving the arms of Castile pride of place again. A series of dynastic marriagesPaula Sutter Fichtner, \\"Dynastic Marriage in Sixteenth-Century Habsburg Diplomacy and Statecraft: An Interdisciplinary Approach,\\" American Historical Review Vol. 81, No. 2 (April 1976), pp. 243-265 in JSTOR enabled the House of Habsburg to occupy the thrones of Castile, Aragon and Navarre, the arms of Castile have appeared in the arms of all Spanish monarchs and, since 1869 when was adopted, in all versions of the national coat of arms. As above, in all these cases giving the Castilian arms pride of place. Leaving aside the Spanish local and provincial heraldry, where can be found numerous examples and being the most prominent the coat of arms of Toledo, the Castilian arms are among the elements of the coats of arms of the autonomous communities (regions) of Castile and Le√≥n (which has adopted the quartering of Ferdinand III), La Rioja, Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura, Madrid, Murcia and within the bordure of the autonomous city of Melilla. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the castle of Castile is depicted in the arms granted to capitals of the Spanish Empire, as is the case of the capital of Ecuador San Francisco de Quito, with a triple-towered castle Argent and two eagles Sable on field Gules. It was granted to Quito by King Charles I (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor), in 1541.

This crest consisted of a castle or fortress with nascent lion on top. These two figures are charges of the Royal arms of the former Crown of Castile. King John II (1406‚Äì1454) adopted this crest was, its use is documented in ten and twenty doblas coins, minted in the city of Seville. According to historian Jos√© Mar√≠a de Francisco Olmos in his study of the late medieval Castilian currency, the obverse of these coins are represented a shield with the Device of the Bend and the Castilian Royal Crest. In the same study, the author recalls that the Crest of the Castle and the Lion is also represented at an image of King John II, an equestrian portrait of the Armorial of the Golden Fleece, preserved in the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal (Paris). Faustino Men√©ndez Pidal de Navascu√©s noted that, previously, the Castilian monarchs had used a crest, consisting of the figure of a nascent griffin Or. This crest, reproduced in the Armorial de Gelre (folio page 60v), was used by Henry II, John I and Henry III. After the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, there is evidence of its usage by Philip I in some versions of his archievement adopted as King jure uxoris of Castile. There are two prominent examples in his seal Image of the seal of King Philip I of Castile: Posse, O. Die Siegel der deutschen Kaiser und K√∂nige v. 3 (1493 - 1711) , 1912. and the book of the Order of the Golden Fleece, illustrated by Simon Bening. The archievement of King Philip I was reproduced in this book due his status as sovereign and grand master of this order.Image of the archievement of King Philip I with the Royal Crest of Castile by Simon Bening. The Spanish monarchs of the House of Habsburg also maintained the royal crest in their archievement. At the beginning of the 16th century the lion of the crest, crowned, began to hold a sword and a globus cruciger. Philip II and Philip III added two crowned helmets with nascent dragons, the crests of the Portuguese and Aragonese monarchs; besides, it gave the crest and arms of Castile pride of place (the central position). This archievement is placed above the bronze figures, portrait of the family of Philip II, by the Milanese sculptor Pompeo Leoni (1533-1608), son of Leone Leoni , that are located in the interior of the Basilica of El Escorial (Madrid).Image of the archievement with crests located in the Basilica of El Escorial. Because of Spanish monarchs gave the Castilian quarters pride of place in their arms, the Royal Crest of Castile remained as single crest at their armorial achievement. Both latest versions of the armorial achievement of Spain with the royal crest, adopted by Philip V and his son Charles III, showed the lion of the crest with a modern royal crown (with eight half arches) and a scroll charged with the battle cry Santiago!. The meaning of the phrase is to praise St. James the apostle, patron saint of Spain. At that time, it was usual to consider the Royal Crest of Castile as the crest of the whole of Spain, thus it was exposed by heraldists as Jos√© de Avil√©s e Iturbide, 1st Marquis of Avil√©s, in his book Ciencia heroyca. Since the 18th century, full royal armorial achievements were used occasionally and the crest of the Castle and lion practically fell into disuseAvil√©s, Jos√© de Avil√©s, Marqu√©s de.

In heraldry, supporters are figures or objects usually placed on either side of the shield and depicted holding it up, first appeared in English heraldry in the 15th century. Originally, they were not regarded as an integral part of arms, and were subject to frequent change. Lions were sporadically shown supporting the arms of the Castilian monarch and were introduced by John II. The lions as supporters were displayed until the reign of Philip V and, after 1868, in some ornate versions of the national arms of Spain.

There has never been a Castilian royal standard or banner with a unique design. There were varied designs of the castle or colours of the fabric, depending on the artisan or prevailing fashion. They have their origin in the representation of the arms of the Castilian monarch on cloth to be used as flag and, by extension were emblem of the Kingdom and the Historic Region of Castile.

The quartering of Ferdinand III was also displayed on his standard and it has served as the basis for current flags of autonomous communities of Castile and Le√≥n and Castile-La Mancha. Further confusions led to apply the colour purple to a legendary ¬´Castilian banner¬ª (which neither preserved nor has never been documented), identifying the color purple as symbol of the Kingdom of Castile, something that influenced in the flag of the Second Spanish Republic and its lowest band. There are different hypotheses to explain the origin of the confusion. Fundamentally, the origin part of chromatic colour relationship among purple and red/crimson. Colour crimson was also widely used to represent the color purple, used in the ancient world as symbol of the sovereignty and authority of monarchs. One of the assumptions made is supported by the fact that with the passage of time many cloths, that originally were crimson, worn may become confused with other tones, as the purple.O¬¥Donnell, Hugo.

These inaccuracies were the creation of a legend on the purple colour of the banner used during the Revolt of the Comuneros against King Charles I of Castile and Aragon (later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), between 1520 and 1521. Nowadays Castilian nationalism movement uses a purple flag charged with the triple-towered castle in the center and Castilian Leftist groups included the castle within a red star.

History  During World War II a number of nations produced self-propelled artillery. These ranged from heavily armored assault guns with 360¬∞ protection to lightly-armored open topped tank-destroyers and self-propelled guns. Often the chassis for these conversions came from tanks or artillery tractors and two such vehicles were the US built M7 Priest and M12 Gun Motor Carriage supplied to Free French forces during World War II. During the 1950s France began a rearmament program to replace both of these guns to provide mobile artillery support for their mechanized divisions. Like in World War II the chassis for these new weapons was a light tank the French AMX-13.  Design  The new vehicle had the same five-wheeled torsion bar suspension with front drive sprocket, rear idler and three return rollers as the AMX-13. The road wheels had solid rubber tires and the metallic tracks could be fitted with rubber traction blocks to lessen damage to roads. An all welded box-shaped steel superstructure is mounted to the rear of the vehicle to provide 360¬∞ of protection from small arms rifle fire and shell splinters. Although protected from all directions the vehicle lacks NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) capability and is not amphibious. The engine and transmission are at the front of the vehicle and the driver is on the left. The gun compartment has a commanders cupola with a periscope and 360¬∞ vision blocks. The cupola also has a ring mount for an external 7.5 or 7.62 mm LMG (Light Machine Gun). The gun compartment also has access hatches at the top and rear. The primary armament for the vehicle is an Obusier de 105 mod√®le 1950 howitzer with a wide range of elevation -4¬∞ to +66¬∞ but with limited traverse 20¬∞ right and left. Traverse and elevation are both manual. French, Israeli, and Moroccan vehicles have a gun barrel which is 23 calibers in length while Dutch vehicles have a barrel 30 calibers in length. Both have a hydro-pneumatic recoil system below the barrel and both are fitted with a double-baffle muzzle brake. The gun fires semi-fixed ammunition and 55 rounds of ammunition could be carried in the gun compartment. Generally, 6 of the 55 rounds were HEAT (High Explosive Anti- tank) with the remaining rounds being HE (High-Explosive). The HEAT round could penetrate of armor at an incidence of 0¬∞ or or armor at 65¬∞. The Mk 61 has more than likely been retired by its users and replaced by either or self- propelled artillery capable of 360¬∞ fire. The Mk 61 would be outranged, under armed and under protected to face today's rivals.  Mk 62  A variant with a longer barrel and a turret capable of 360¬∞ of traverse was offered to Switzerland and although it was tested it was not adopted by them.

Philip was an English Quaker, but had strong sympathies with Irish nationalism and was involved in the events of Easter 1916. After that he was possibly held in Lewes naval prison until June 1916 when he was transferred to Frongoch camp, north Wales. The couple moved to Ireland a number of years after their marriage, living at 124 Leinster Road, Rathmines, Dublin in 1915. Sargent toured the country on behalf of the Gaelic League, singing traditional Irish songs. She began acting in 1918 in the Abbey Theatre and silent films, under the name \\"Dymphna Daly\\". She played the part of Mrs Golder in John MacDonagh's The Irish Jew at the Empire in 1921, alongside Jimmy O'Dea. In the years that followed she appeared in a number of O'Dea's revues, but did not act full-time as she felt it was not compatible with her family commitments. She described herself as \\"drifting\\" into journalism, but it is her regular column in The Herald that she was best known. Her column appeared from 1920 until 1940, and featured the phonetically written conversations of Dublin characters called Mrs Casey, Mrs Byrne, and Mrs Win-the-war. These characters were used for radio sketches in 1928, where she performed with Joan Burke on 2RN. Owing to the success of the characters they were featured at fancy dress balls. Her other broadcasting work included adaptations of classic children's stories, and performing in some of John MacDonagh's radio plays. She returned to the Abbey in 1956 for St. John Greer Ervine's Boyd's shop, and in 1958 for a small part in Miche√°l Mac Liamm√≥ir's adaptation of The informer at the Gate. Sargent died suddenly on 23 December 1967 at home at 49 Mespil Road, Dublin. She was buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery.

A native of Nassau, he was a standout at Sheridan College and TCU, earning third-team All-Mountain West Conference accolades as a senior. Cadot has played professionally in several different countries, with teams in Ecuador, Iceland, and Slovakia. He has played for the Bahamas national team on multiple occasions.  Early life and high school  Cadot was born in Nassau, Bahamas to Mary Cadot and Michelet Thomas and grew up with two sisters, Renee and Melani, and three brothers, Tony, Jimmy and Michael. From his childhood, he idolized his father, saying that he \\"tried to live through him.\\" Cadot started playing basketball in ninth grade and played for C. V. Bethel Senior High School in Nassau. In his junior season, he led the team to a high school championship and was named most valuable player (MVP) of the title game after erupting for 36 points, 12 rebounds and 3 steals.  College career  After high school, Cadot hoped to continue his career by playing college basketball in the United States. He initially competed for a junior college for academic reasons. Cadot started his freshman season in 2008‚Äì09 at Sheridan College in Sheridan, Wyoming, averaging 15 points and 6.6 rebounds in 23 games. In his sophomore campaign, he averaged 17 points, 7.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game, collecting National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Third-Team All-American and first-team All-Region IX honors. He guided Sheridan College to the North Sub-Regional title by scoring 32 points and the game-winning basket against Northwest College. Before the 2010‚Äì11 season, Cadot transferred to TCU and was praised by head coach Jim Christian for his athleticism, attitude, and defense. According to his TCU profile, he is tall and weighs . He was mainly drawn to the program due to his relationship with its coaching staff. In his junior season, Cadot averaged 8.2 points, 6 rebounds, 1.1 assists, and 1 steal per game. As a senior, he averaged 11.4 points, 7 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 1.5 steals per game, garnering third-team All-Mountain West Conference recognition. Cadot left TCU with the second-best career field goal percentage in school history, at 56.6 percent.  Professional career  Following college, Cadot received pre-draft workout offers from the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). On August 27, 2012, he signed a one-year deal with SPU Nitra of the Slovak Extraliga. Through 26 games, Cadot averaged 16.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.9 steals per game.

Construction and career Tellina was constructed by Jones Buckie Slip & Shipyard Ltd., Buckie, Scotland (yard number 101), to replace the earlier research vessel . Tellina was launched in 1960, and built according to a design prepared by the United Kingdom White Fish Authority. The specification called for the vessel to have a shallow draught so that she could work close inshore, and for her to be capable of using harbours that largely dried out at low water. While in service with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom), Tellina was mostly engaged in inshore surveys of young flatfish all around the British Isles, herring and sprat in the Wash, Humber and Thames estuary and of inshore shellfish stocks (crab, lobster, scallops whelks).Goodwin, N.B., Dare, P.J., Belson, S.J., Gunstone, K.L., Ellis, J.R., Rogers, S.I.

In 1982 Tellina was sold into private ownership, and renamed Dawn Hunter. In 1984, 1986, 1987 and 1988 Dawn Hunter was re-hired by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) to continue her earlier work surveying young flatfish along the English East coast, herring in the Thames estuary but also Nephrops (Norway lobster) fishing grounds of northeast England. In 1984-1988 she was listed as being owned by Captain John Cole, and based out of Whitby, Yorkshire.Cruise Report ‚Äì 1984 Charter Cruise Programme ‚Äì Dawn Hunter, 13 July-2 August 1984.Cruise Report ‚Äì 1986 Charter Cruise Programme ‚Äì Dawn Hunter, 15-24 July 1986.Cruise Report ‚Äì 1988 Charter Cruise Programme ‚Äì Dawn Hunter, 9-29 February 1988. She was briefly owned by the proprietor of Belfast Marine and was subsequently rebuilt into a luxury yacht, according to a design by G.L. Watson & Co. (Liverpool). Dawn Hunter was fitted out as a ketch (a two-masted sailing craft). She is primarily constructed of pitch pine planking on oak frames with mahogany superstructure. Dawn Hunter is currently listed as being for sale (for a price of GB ¬£ 235,000), in Poole Harbour, Dorset. =Service as a fisheries research vessel= Tellina (LT242) was in service with Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from August 1960 until October 1981, during which time she participated in 281 separate research campaigns. She was largely confined to inshore coastal waters including the Humber estuary, East Anglia, Thames estuary, Cardigan Bay, North Wales and English Channel (Cornwall, Devon and Dorset). During mid-April 1963, Tellina made an exploratory trawl survey around the Channel Islands and M.R. Vince took the opportunity to question local fishermen about deaths amongst marine animals during the excessively severe winter of 1962‚Äì63 in the United Kingdom now known as the \\"big freeze.\\"Crisp, D.J. (1964) The effects of the severe winter of 1962‚Äì1963 on marine life in Britain. Journal of Animal Ecology, 33: 1.65-210. In June 1970 Tellina was used to conduct a series of fishing gear trials, whereby a team of scuba divers was employed to observe and photograph the seabed both in front of, and immediately behind a moving trawl. During each trial, two divers \\"rode\\" on the headline of the net, taking photographs or filming the action of the gear, and making occasional excursions forward along the net wings or back to the cod-end.Bridger, J.P. (1970) Some effects of the passage of a trawl over the seabed. ICES CM: 1970/B:10 This extremely hazardous procedure would likely not be allowed today and has been made unnecessary by the use of automatic cameras attached to fishing gears. Studies aboard Tellina in the early 1960s showed that the young stages of commercially important flatfish, particularly sole and plaice, could be found in inshore nursery grounds, but that there was no information on the size or extent of these juvenile populations. Further surveys of the inshore waters of England between 1970 and 1972 revealed the general extent of the nursery grounds for the first time, and identified areas that were particularly important for the survival and growth of young fish. These early surveys subsequently evolved into an annual Young Fish Survey (YFS), that continued uninterrupted from 1981 up until 2010, and included multiple sites all along the North Sea coast, the Thames estuary and English Channel (especially around the Solent).Rogers, S.

Tellina was used extensively to investigate the distribution and abundance of 0-group (juvenile) herring, using beach seine and midwater trawls. This survey made use of early echo-sounding techniques. The larval surveys, which had been started in 1956 (aboard the vessels Onaway and ) were continued on an international basis, and an annual pre-recruit survey was inaugurated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1963. Tellina was also used for investigations into other pelagic species of commercial importance, most notably sprat in the Wash, Thames Estuary and southern North Sea as well as in Tor Bay in the English Channel.

Service history  =Fish and Wildlife Service= John R. Manning starting a purse seine set in the tropical Pacific Ocean, ca. 1950.After her commissioning as RV John R. Manning (FWS 1002), the vessel departed Seattle, Washington, on 21 February 1950, called at San Pedro, California, then proceeded to her home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from which she operated in support of the FWS‚Ä≤s Pacific Oceanic Fishery Investigations (POFI). She began her FWS career with a shakedown and training period off Hawaii before departing for a cruise to the Line Islands. POFI tasked her to search for commercially viable populations of fish around the Hawaiian Islands and in the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Philippine Sea between Hawaii and Palau in cooperation with the United States West Coast fishing industry, as well as to test alternative capture methods because of the lack of live bait in the open ocean. Accordingly, she conducted exploratory tuna fishing operations around the Hawaiian Islands and experimented with the use of purse- seining for skipjack tuna around Hawaii and of gillnetting around the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands. Her crew reported disappointing results with purse-seining and gillnetting, but also that the use of modified longline gear yielded a 40 percent increase in the take of yellowfin tuna. Fisheries scientists aboard John R. Manning studied the diets of albacore, yellowfin tuna, and big-eyed tuna by examining the contents of their stomachs. During her early years in the tropical Pacific, John R. Manning captured a number of rare or unusual fishes. These included: * two juvenile scalloped ribbonfish (then identified as Trachypterus iris but later as Zu cristatus) from a depth of about 16,200 feet (4,938 meters) at on 4 May 1953;King and Ikehara, p. 22. * two female cookiecutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis) ‚Äì known from the tropical Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific Oceans but rarely recorded previously in the central or eastern Pacific ‚Äì one from a depth of about at on 23 May 1954 and one from a depth of about at on 2 June 1954;King and Ikehara, pp. 18‚Äì20. * a unicorn crestfish (Eumecichthys fiski) ‚Äì a very rare fish caught on only a few occasions previously and then mostly in waters off Japan ‚Äì from a depth of about at on 1 June 1954;King and Ikehara, pp. 20‚Äì22. and * a juvenile deal fish (Desmodema polystictum), also known as a polka-dot ribbonfish or spotted ribbonfish ‚Äì poorly understood at the time and known mostly from specimens washed up on shore and only rarely caught in nets ‚Äì from a depth of about at on 25 May 1954.King and Ikehara, pp. 22‚Äì23. Under the direction of oceanographer Townsend Cromwell, John R. Manning also contributed to improved understanding of sea temperatures in the Marshall Islands area, joining the FWS vessel Hugh M. Smith in the first half of 1950 in taking the only bathythermograph readings of water temperatures ever taken in the area other than those taken by the United States Navy destroyers , , and and hydrographic survey ship during Operation Crossroads in 1946.Robinson, Margaret K., \\"Sea Temperature in the Marshall Islands,\\" Bikini and Nearby Atolls, Marshall Islands, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1954, p. 288 Retrieved August 31, 2018 In 1954, John R. Manning began a new assignment, exploring the waters of the North Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Alaska for commercially valuable Pacific albacore populations. While longlining off Hawaii during these operations in 1955, she captured a marlin weighing that had a , yellowfin tuna in its stomach that it had recently swallowed headfirst.Burton, Maurice, ed., International Wildlife Encyclopedia, Third Edition, Volume 11: LEO‚ÄìMAR, Tarrytown, New York: Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2002, , p. 1562 Retrieved August 31, 2018 At the time, a debate existed as to whether billfish such as marlins used their elongated snouts to spear their prey; the yellowfin had two holes in its body consistent with the marlin having speared it, providing clear evidence of this behavior. In 1956, the Fish and Wildlife Service underwent a major reorganization in which it was renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and its oceangoing vessels were placed under its new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF). That year, John R. Mannings home port changed from Pearl Harbor to Juneau, Alaska. In 1957, she began operating in support of the Northeastern Pacific Albacore Survey, operating in the Pacific Ocean along the west coast of North America to investigate populations of tuna and their movements. John R. Manning underwent an overhaul at Seattle in early 1963, during which shipyard workers discovered a substantial dry rot problem which required the replacement of entire planks and timbers. After completion of these repairs, she had an eventful year in 1963, engaging in exploratory scallop fishing in the Gulf of Alaska and later carrying scientists on an expedition to tag king crabs around Kodiak Island. She also took part in five search-and-rescue actions during 1963, and in four of them rescued about 20 people from six different vessels in distress. During most of the 1960s, John R. Manning conducted halibut and other bottomfish surveys and fisheries patrols, including observation of foreign fishing activities in the Bering Sea. Her patrols took place mostly in the Gulf of Alaska,Ommer, Rosemary E., R. Ian Perry, Kevern Cochrane, and Philippe Cury, eds, World Fisheries: A Social-Ecological Analysis, Chichester, UK: Blackwell Publishing, 2011, , unpaginated Retrieved August 31, 2018 and a 1964 BCF publication on foreign fishing activities in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska reported very negatively on her patrol work, describing her crew as \\"inept\\" and the vessel herself as \\"inadequate,\\" concluding that she was \\"severely lacking as a law enforcement vessel\\" and that her \\"very presence among the most modern fishing fleets in the world is damaging to US prestige,\\" and recommended her replacement. Despite the negative report, John R. Manning remained in service. In 1967, she supported the BCF's Exploratory Fishing and Gear Research (EF&GR;) program by assessing the mid-water populations in the Bering Sea of Alaskan pink shrimp, using echo-sounding transects and test drags with a Cobb pelagic trawl to locate schools of Alaskan pink shrimp at night well above the sea floor in inshore waters. In 1968 and 1969, she conducted exploratory surveys of scallop populations in Southeast Alaska for EF&GR.; The USFWS decommissioned John R. Manning in 1969. The newly refurbished BCF research vessel RV Oregon replaced her. =Later career= The USFWS sold John R. Manning, and she became the commercial fishing vessel R. B. Hendrickson. On 13 May 1979, R. B. Hendrickson ran aground and sank.

It is directed by Sam Hargrave (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Joe Russo, based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando Le√≥n Gonz√°lez, and Eric Skillman. The film's cast also features Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda, Golshifteh Farahani, Pankaj Tripathi and David Harbour, and follows a black ops mercenary who must rescue an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Netflix released Extraction on April 24, 2020. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances and action sequences, but criticized the plot and excessive violence. It became the most watched original film in Netflix's history, and a sequel is in development. Plot After a day at school, Ovi Mahajan ‚Äì son of an incarcerated Indian drug lord ‚Äì sneaks out of his house to visit a club, where he is kidnapped by police officers working for rival drug lord Amir Asif. Saju Rav, a former Para (SF) operator and Ovi's protector, visits Ovi‚Äôs father in prison. Unwilling to pay the ransom as it will his hurt prestige, Ovi Mahajan, Sr. orders Saju to retrieve his son, threatening Saju's own family. Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black-market mercenary and former SASR operator, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to rescue Ovi from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rake and Khan‚Äôs team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Rake rescues Ovi, kills his captors, and takes him to the extraction point, but his father's men intentionally fail to transfer the funds. Instead, Saju kills Rake's teammates to bring Ovi back himself to avoid any payment to the mercenary group. Learning of Ovi‚Äôs escape, Asif orders an immediate lockdown of Dhaka, securing all bridges out of the city. Khan arranges for a helicopter to extract Rake outside the city and tells him to abandon Ovi as they will not get paid for Ovi's extraction contract. He refuses, haunted by memories of his own son, who died at a young age from lymphoma when he left. After escaping Saju and the corrupt police and tactical units, Rake fights off a gang of boys led by Farhad, a young criminal determined to impress Asif. Rake calls his friend Gaspar, a retired squad-mate living in Dhaka, and he and Ovi lay low at Gaspar‚Äôs home. Gaspar reveals Asif has placed a $10 million bounty on Ovi, which he offers to share if Rake allows him to kill Ovi. Rake refuses and fights Gaspar, who gains the upper hand but is fatally shot by Ovi. Rake calls Saju and asks for his help, forcing them to team up to escape Dhaka. Rake draws attention away from a disguised Saju and Ovi as the two make their way through a bridge checkpoint, then follows to cover their escape. Khan and her remaining mercenaries approach from the opposite side of the bridge, as Asif watches from afar with binoculars. In the ensuing firefight, Saju is sniped by Asif's colonel Rashid, who is in turn sniped by Khan. Wounded, Rake instructs Ovi to run to Khan‚Äôs waiting helicopter. As Rake follows, he is shot in the neck by Farhad and, seeing Ovi is safe, falls into the river. Ovi, Khan, and the extraction team escape to Mumbai. Eight months later, Khan kills Asif in a men‚Äôs restroom. Ovi jumps into his school‚Äôs swimming pool and surfaces to see a man watching him. He is out of focus, but appears to be similar to Tyler Rake.

In addition, Chris Hemsworth was set to star in the film. In November 2018, the rest of the cast was set. Production began in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018. Filming next took place in Ban Pong, Ratchaburi, Thailand and plateshots in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The cast stayed in Nakhon Pathom. Principal production ended in March 2019. The film's working title was initially Dhaka but was changed to Out of the Fire, before the final title was revealed to be Extraction on February 19, 2020. Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher composed the film score, who worked together in 21 Bridges while the Russo Brothers producing the film. BMG has released the soundtrack. English indie rock band Alt-J's In Cold Blood (Baauer Remix) was used for the official trailer. Reception =Viewership= Extraction was the top-streamed item in its debut weekend, then fell to sixth place (but third among films) in its second week. Netflix estimated the film would be watched by about 90 million households during its first month of release, the biggest premiere in the service's history. The film returned to the site's top-10 during the 4th of July weekend. In July 2020, Netflix revealed the film had in-fact been watched by 99 million households in its first four weeks of release, the most-ever for one of their original films. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 205 reviews, with an average rating of 6.14/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Spectacular stunt work and an electric performance from Chris Hemsworth can't save Extraction from being dragged down by its aimless violence.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times praised the performances of Hemsworth and Hooda, and wrote: \\"Featuring one of the most stunning action scenes in recent memory... [the film] is breakneck and bonkers.\\" Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt gave the film a \\"B\\" and wrote that it \\"mostly delivers what its swaggering trailer promises: international scenery; insidious villains; a taciturn, tree-trunk Aussie.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and said: \\"Aiming for the fight poetry of the John Wick franchise, Extraction comes closer to a series of stunts strung together to look like an ultraviolent video game (think Manhunt 2) in which the avatars are played by actual humans.\\" Extraction was criticized by several outlets as having \\"white savior\\" elements. Variety called the film \\"a white-savior version of Man on Fire,\\" while Screen Rant said that the film's \\"regressive white savior elements\\" drag it down. In an overall positive review, Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote: \\"Look, let's get this out of the way. Yes, director Sam Hargrave and writer Joe Russo's Extraction... is an arguably 'problematic' white savior flick but it‚Äôs also a solid action-adventure\\". The Daily Star expressed concern over the representation of Dhaka, calling the representation \\"bleak and inaccurate, but Dhaka nonetheless\\". BBC Bangla also noted many complaints online about the portrayal of Dhaka and Bangladesh in the film. Sequel In May 2020, it was reported Joe Russo had been hired to write a sequel to the film, with the intention of both Sam Hargrave and Chris Hemsworth returning.

Synopsis After detecting an abandoned derelict rich in resources, the crew head off to scavenge it. They split in pairs, with Rimmer and Kryten heading to recruit the facility's head medi-bot, Asclepius, but in a case of mistaken identity recruit its resident snack dispenser, Snacky, instead. Meanwhile, Lister and Cat discover the decomposed remains of Romero G. Gonzalez, a former stasis booth engineer who apparently killed himself. Just then, Lister and Cat are knocked unconscious by the real Asclepius, seemingly rendered computer senile. An asteroid storm in the direct path of the facility is detected, and Rimmer, Kryten, and Snacky search for Lister and Cat so they can quickly escape. They manage to find and stop Asclepius from operating on the two, but in a hail of gunfire exchanged with the deranged robot, destroy some kidneys on-display in the process. They make their escape onboard Starbug just as the space station is obliterated by incoming asteroids. Back on Red Dwarf, Lister is receiving treatment by Kryten due to his lack of kidneys, apparently blown- up in the crossfire. The two concoct a plan to have Cat \\"agree\\" to donate one of his, due to Cat being an inherently selfish creature who refuses to do so otherwise. After successfully swindling Cat, the gang are ready for Snacky to operate, only for Snacky to reveal he is not Asclepius. The crew formulate a plan, however, using Snacky's knowledge of stasis booths, acquired from regularly serving Gonzalez and overhearing his conversations on the subject. The four of them use a stasis booth, now able to time travel to a prior instance onboard Red Dwarf, to knockout Lister from a couple days prior and take his kidneys, with Kryten installing an \\"MTK chip\\" into his bloodstream keeping him alive until after the encounter with Asclepius.

The Survey's activities began on 31 March 1841, with the goal of surveying the Great Lakes. The Lake Survey was created within the United States Army Topographical Engineers (later the United States Army Corps of Engineers). Like the Commerce Department's Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Lake Survey had responsibility for the preparation and publication of nautical charts and other navigational aids. By 1882, the Survey had completed the original Congressional mandate, producing 76 charts, then disbanded. By 1901, the original survey and charting products required revision. The Lake Survey was reconstituted and its mission expanded. In addition to traditional survey, charting, and navigation information responsibilities, the Lake Survey was also responsible for studies on lake levels and associated river flow.The Great Lakes Early history (1841‚Äì56) The United States Lakes Survey was created on 31 March 1841 by an act of Congress, appropriating $15,000 for a United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers led survey of the Great Lakes. William G. Williams was appointed the first commander of the survey. He was assisted by Howard Stansbury, James H. Simpson, Joseph E. Johnston and I. Carle Woodruff. They were headquartered at the mouth of the Buffalo River. In the first summer, a detailed topographical survey of Mackinac Island was completed, reconnaissance surveys in the northern part of Lake Michigan were made and a site for a baseline near the entrance to Green Bay was selected and partly cleared. The first four years of the survey largely dealt with the baseline at Green Bay, and building triangulation stations. Surveying work was additionally done on Lakes Michigan, St. Clair, and Erie, and at the Straits of Mackinac. To conduct hydrographic surveys, in 1843, an iron steamer named the Abert (after John James Abert) was built for the survey. Flaws in the ship's design were soon discovered, and it was overhauled and renamed Surveyor in early 1845. By the end of 1845, all harbors besides those in Lake Superior had been surveyed. James Kearney replaced Williams in 1845, relocating the survey to Detroit. Work was temporarily halted for most of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. After the war, work resumed and the west end of Lake Erie was completed in 1849. John N. Macomb took command of the lake survey in 1851. It greatly increased in size and appropriations. It published its first charts in 1852‚Äìcovering all of Lake Erie. During the 1852‚Äì55 seasons, the areas surveyed by the Lake Survey included the Straits of Mackinac and the approaches to either side of Mackinac Island, part of the north end of Lake Michigan, all of the St. Marys River, and a few harbors on Lake Superior. As a result of this work the Lake Survey published three new charts. A second steamer, the Jefferson Davis (after Jefferson Davis) was launched in 1856, and soon renamed Search. George Meade Meade years (1857‚Äì61) On 20 May 1857, Kearney was replaced by George Meade. Meade completed the survey of Lake Huron during the 1857‚Äì59 seasons and completed the survey of Saginaw Bay as well. He surveyed the Fox and Manitou Islands, and Grand and Little Traverse Bays. The Lake Survey completed a few local harbor surveys on Lake Superior by 1859 and began a general survey of the western end of that lake in 1861. He oversaw a dramatic expansion in the survey, including the construction of an observatory in Detroit and the first systematic recording of lake water levels. In 1859, a network of 19 meteorological stations around the Lakes were completed. From 1858 through 1861, the federal appropriations for the Lake Survey grew to $75,000 annually. Meade would later write that he considered his early work on the lakes survey as among the most important duties of his extensive career. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, he offered his services to the Union Army. Completion of original survey James D. Graham replaced Meade in 1861, and led the survey through much of the Civil War, during which it was the only active topographical field office still operating. During the war, the department still increased, with appropriations rising to $125,000 in 1865. Surveys were completed of Portage Entry on Keweenaw Bay, and the waters of the Keweenaw Waterway. In 1863, the survey formally became part of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In 1864, William F. Reynolds replaced Graham. As a result of the work on Lake Superior, eight new charts of that lake were published between 1865 and 1873. The charts were given away for free to mariners. Between October 1861 and October 1865, 15,210 navigational charts had been distributed to Great Lakes mariners, bringing the number issued since 1852 to 30,120. In 1869, distribution was further expanded as the Lake Survey was authorized to sell surplus charts for the first time. In the spring of 1867, a program of river flow measurement was created. Three years later, Reynolds was removed from his command. Cyrus B. Comstock replaced him. Comstock oversaw the completion of a larger observatory, the publishing of a first complete set of charts. The surveys of Lake Michigan were completed in 1874, Lake Superior in 1874, Lake Ontario in 1875 and Lake Erie in 1877. Lake St. Clair and Lake Champlain were completed in 1871. During the summer of 1873 and the following winter, a complete survey of the city of Detroit and the Detroit River was made. A survey of the St. Lawrence began during 1871 at the boundary line near St. Regis, New York, and ended at the head of the river on Lake Ontario in 1873. The survey work on the Mississippi, for which Congress appropriated $16,000 in 1876, began in Cairo, Illinois, and was completed at the mouth of the Arkansas River in 1879. The survey was officially completed in 1882, when the original mandate was completed, with 76 charts produced. A historian at the time said: Seal of the US Geological Survey Re- establishment In the decade after the original survey was ended, it became clear that the charts were not sufficient; for example, since the deepest draft vessels used in the Great Lakes in the mid-late 1800s drew only of water, the Survey's charts only showed depths of or less. Though work on charts had continued in the time between the survey, the Lake Survey was officially re-formed on 9 January 1901, having been part of the Detroit office of the Army Corps of Engineers since 1889. For the first time, the Survey published maps in color, and the Great Lakes Bulletin. The charts and bulletin were increasingly requested. The Survey collaborated with the United States Geological Survey, and resumed field surveys, resurveying Apostle Islands and vicinity on Lake Superior, the St. Lawrence River, and northern Lake Michigan and the Straits of Mackinac. Several more steamers were acquired to cope with increased workload. Areas that needed the most work were identified, being the east end of Lake Superior and the waters around Isle Royale; the southern end of Lake Michigan; the Straits of Mackinac; both ends of Lake Erie; and the east end of Lake Ontario including the head of the St. Lawrence River. In addition, along the shores of the Lakes in inadequately surveyed areas, sounding and sweeping were necessary. Specifically, these areas were the south shore of Lake Superior, Grand and Little Traverse Bays, the Keweenaw Peninsula, the west shore of Lake Michigan, and the south and west shores of Lake Huron. It worked on those projects for the next 30 years. The Survey worked on several water diversion projects, including that undertaken by the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company (in 1906) and water diversion into the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (1912), both times it was called upon to study the effect the diversion would have. On 4 March 1911, its jurisdiction was expanded to include the New York State Barge Canal System and the areas between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods, which included the Boundary Waters. After several other expansions, in 1914, it became responsible for \\"an inland waterway system extending nearly halfway across the continental United States\\". During World War I, the Lake Survey printed recruiting posters, charts and maps for the areas outside the Great Lakes, and other items requested by the War Department. By the end of 1918, it had printed and distributed 573,000 charts of the Great Lakes. Mason Patrick was one of the commanders during this time. Work continued throughout the 1920s. By 1922, the Lake Survey was distributing 123 different charts. The Superior Shoal was discovered. Funding shrunk at the onset of the Great Depression, but aerial photography was introduced. In 1936, a total of over 1 million charts was reached. To support new equipment and new surveys, funding for the Lake Survey was expanded in the 1930s. The project begun in 1907 was completed, and resurveying began in 1937. The press room of the Lake Survey, 1945 World War II and later work Upon the outbreak of World War II, the survey began working in various war capacities. It published a \\"Submarine Training Chart of Upper Lake Michigan\\" pamphlet. The Lake Survey, with its cartographic and lithographic specialists, directed a major portion of the military's mapping activity. It took over and consolidated the former WPA cartographic units in New York, Chicago, and Detroit on 1 June 1942. It published 370 tons of maps, producing 8,109 different charts and maps, printing and distributing 9,190,000 copies to the armed forces. It was also responsible for Mosaic Mapping Unit in Detroit and the Military Grid Unit at New York City, accounting for another 885 separate mosaic maps with more than 3,128,000 copies being printed. The survey received the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award for its work. After World War II, work on the survey continued. During the shipping season of 1948, it began work on an experimental \\"radar chart\\". The mapping unit also continued to do some work for the War Department, particularly during the Korean War. Electronic surveying methods were also tested. The Survey grew further in 1962 with the establishment of the Great Lakes Research Center. The Center conducted strong programs in coastal engineering and water resources. It was involved heavily in the building of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Growth of the survey continued, reaching over two million dollars of appropriations in 1968. By Reorganization Plan Number 4 of 1970, effective October 3, 1970, Lake Survey Office transferred to newly established National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), where it was redesignated the Lake Survey Center and assigned to the National Ocean Survey. Various activities of the Lake Survey Center transferred to other NOAA organizations, 1974‚Äì76. The Lake Survey Center was abolished, June 30, 1976.

The third generation received a heavy design change, designed by Osamu Shikado in 1999.  Development  For the third generation, the Dodge Viper was heavily redesigned, courtesy of Osamu Shikado from Dodge's performance division, Street & Racing Technology. The design took inspiration from the Viper competition coup√© concept, also designed by Shikado which was unveiled two years prior as a preview for the next generation of the Viper.  Production  The third generation of the Viper would get heavy design updates. The new Viper was introduced in 2002, named as the SRT-10, which replaced both the RT/10 and GTS models. The engine displacement was increased from 8.0 to 8.3 liters, and along with other upgrades, the engine produced a maximum power output of , and of torque. The weight of the engine would also lose as much as . The chassis would become more rigid and lightweight, losing . A 6-speed Tremec T56 manual transmission is used to deliver all of the power to the rear wheels. Three years later after the SRT-10 was unveiled, the coup√© version of the Viper would be launched, adapting the same \\"double-bubble\\" structure as the GTS from the previous generation. This model would have an increased power output of , and of torque. The design of the car takes styling cues from the GTS, with the rear portion of the car adapting the tail shape, and the taillights using a design inspired by the GTS. Dodge would stop production of the Viper for 2007, in lieu of preparing the new updates for the car for the 2008 model year.

Founded in 1869, the School is responsible for the majority of Princeton's master's and doctoral degree programs in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. The school offers Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in 42 disciplines. It also administers several pre-professional programs, including the Master in Finance (M.Fin.), Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.), and Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), Master in Public Affairs (M.P.A.), Master in Public Policy (M.P.P.), and Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degrees. The Graduate School is widely considered to be one of the best academic institutions in the United States and in the world. Students are able to work directly with faculty advisors, many of whom are the leading scholars in their fields. The relatively small number of students allows doctoral education to be tailored to each students needs, emphasizing original and independent research in a tight-knit community of scholars. Students who complete the program continue on to careers in academia, government, and industry. The Graduate School has produced a number of Nobel Prize Laureates, Fields Medal Winners, university presidents, cabinet ministers, MacArthur \\"Genius Grant\\" Fellows, Pulitzer Prize winners, ambassadors, heads of state, and heads of government. The School also guarantees fully funded stipends, which covers tuition, health fees, and living expenses, for all PhD students. PhD students may earn additional funding from teaching fellowships, research assistantships, and competitive awards. Master's students are also able to graduate debt-free through Princeton's \\"no-loan\\" policy. History In 1771, future President James Madison began graduate work at Princeton University under the tutelage of President John Witherspoon, another founding father. Often considered Princeton's \\"first graduate student,\\" Madison studied Hebrew and Political Philosophy, which provided him the foundation for his later career as the Delegate to the Congress of the Confederation from Virginia, Secretary of State, and President of the United States. After his studies, students were then permitted to stay at the university after receiving their bachelor's degrees. By 1869, graduate education was standardized through the establishment of general examinations and graduate fellowships. Princeton conferred the first graduate degrees to James F. Williamson and William Libby in 1879. The first Dean of the Graduate School was Andrew Fleming West. He envisioned a graduate institution that would both produce high quality graduate work from a small number of students. By the 1880s, eight graduate students were enrolled in programs in art and archaeology, astronomy, biology, classics, geology, mathematics, philosophy, and physics. Enrollment gradually increased over the years, particularly under the leadership of physicist Augustus Trowbridge. Applications for graduate enrollment also rose after World War II and after federal funding for graduate fellowships increased substantially, most notably in the sciences. Women began to enroll in the Graduate School in the 1960s. The first PhD was awarded in 1964. In 1977, Nina G. Garsoian accepted a position as the ninth dean of the Graduate School, the first woman to occupy that position. =The Graduate College= The Graduate College, the residence of the Dean of the Graduate School and home to many graduate students, was established in 1913. Inspired by the design of Magdalen Tower at Oxford University, the architecture of the Graduate College features brown and gray Princeton stone and green and blue roofs. Build in 1913 and expanded in 1927, the Old Graduate College features traditional Gothic-style architecture in addition to the 173-foot tall Cleveland Tower, a memorial to former university trustee and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. The central quadrangle of the Graduate College, Thomson College, is a memorial to United States Senator John R. Thomson. New Graduate College was built adjacent to the Old Graduate College in 1962, presenting modern-style architecture and comfortable living spaces. =High table= The tradition of \\"High Table\\" traces back to Oxford University and Cambridge University. Fellows of the college were to sit at the end of long refectory tables on raised platforms, dais, above the undergraduates. At Princeton, the tradition began in 1913 in Procter Hall with Professor Howard Crosby Butler. Students, faculty, and guests were invited to sit with the Dean of the Graduate College at a monthly ceremony. Until the 1970s, dinner at Procter Hall opened with Latin grace spoken by a student, the Master (Professor), or the Dean. High Table continues to bring select students and faculty together for discussions and, during formal events, dinners jackets or academic gowns may also be worn. Academics Policies and procedures for graduate academics at Princeton are administered by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School, located at Clio Hall. Admission to the Graduate School is highly selective with an acceptance rate of approximately 11.7% across all disciplines. The average Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores for admitted students were 163 out of 170 on the verbal section, 161 out of 170 on the quantitative section and 4.5 out of 6 on the analytical writing section. In the 2018-2019 academic year, 1,373 students were admitted into the graduate school. =Degrees and programs= The Graduate School offers a number of degree-granting programs in the fields of humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. In addition to its own Masters and PhD programs, the School oversees graduate degrees for the Bendheim Center for Finance, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.

The paper was based on a three-page cabinet agreement from 6July and laid out the type of future relationship between UK and European Union (EU) that the UK sought to achieve in the Brexit negotiations. In July 2018, former Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (Brexit Secretary), Dominic Raab, described it as a \\"detailed proposal for a principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the UK and the EU\\". He also stated that \\"the white paper proposes a free trade area for goods to maintain frictionless trade, supported by a common rulebook and a new facilitated customs arrangement, but only for the rules that are necessary to provide frictionless trade at the border.\\" The white paper was finalised at a meeting of the UK Cabinet held at Chequers on 6July 2018. Brexit Secretary, David Davis, and Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, resigned in opposition to the plan. The plan was rejected by the EU in September 2018. Proposals The white paper is split into fourchapters: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. The plan aims at holding the UK in a close relationship with the EU, stating that the new relationship be \\"broader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country\\". This would be done by establishing a new association agreement. Continued access to the European Single Market for goods and a common rulebook on state aid would be agreed, preventing either side from subsidising their own industries. For its part, the UK would commit to maintaining high environmental, climate change, social, employment and consumer protection standards. When presenting the plan, May addressed the Irish border question, stating that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and no border in the UK\\". A \\"facilitated customs agreement\\" would remove the need for customs checks by treating the UK and EU \\"as if a combined customs territory\\". The UK would apply EU's tariffs and trade policy on goods intended for the bloc but would control its own tariffs and trade for the domestic market. This differs from a \\"Canada-plus\\" deal favoured by the Conservative backbench European Research Group, which would not apply EU tariffs on goods bound for the EU and therefore may threaten such tariffs if countries use lower tariffs in the UK to facilitate tariff-free access with EU countries, undermining EU tariffs; however, it is seen as likely that such a scenario would require a hard border on the island of Ireland as technological solutions to the Irish border questions are not yet available. Reactions and resignations alt= The proposals gained minimal support from Conservative politicians or leaders of EU member states. In the summer of 2018, May met German Chancellor Angela Merkel as well as French President Emmanuel Macron in order to garner support for the proposals from her French and German counterparts. May favoured a policy of \\"managed divergence\\" from the EU. This policy was explicitly rejected in September 2018, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that the integrity of the European Single Market is \\"not negotiable\\", and that there can be no \\"cherry picking\\" of the market's fourfreedoms: free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Chequers supported staying in the Single Market for goods, but not the other three freedoms. This had been rejected by the President of the European Council (Donald Tusk) and Barnier before it was in the Chequers deal, as well as numerous dates from the 20 July to 21 September 2018. The EU opposes such divergence as it fears that offering favorable deals to Britain may encourage other member-states to follow Britain's example. Tusk said that the deal was \\"a step in the right direction\\" and that there were \\"positive elements\\" of the proposal, but added that \\"the suggested element for economic cooperation will not work, not least because it risks undermining the single market\\". May, on the other hand, said that Britain needs to see more counter-proposals from the EU. Davis, Brexit Secretary at the time of the Chequers meeting, resigned over the agreement on 8July, as did Davis' parliamentary under-secretary, Steve Baker. Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson followed him the next day. In his resignation speech of 18July, Johnson said the government allowed \\"a fog of self-doubt\\" to fall on its negotiations. The speech received notable attention, and BBC political reporter Laura Kuenssberg said it was \\"the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes\\".

The original architect is unknown; however renovations 1857 were undertaken by William Weaver. It was built from 1811 to 1857, with the earliest section built by convict labour. It has also been known as Bunker's Cottage, Bunker's Farm, Liverpool Golf Course Clubhouse, Collingwood Heritage Precinct and Discovery Park. The property is owned by Liverpool City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 December 2006.  History  =Aboriginal usage= The land on which the Collingwood Estate (Bunkers Farm) is located is associated with the Tharawal, Dharug and Gundungurra peoples. The Gundungurra (also spelt Gundungurry, Gandangara) people's country extended from the Blue Mountains at Hartley and Lithgow through the Burragorang and Megalong Valleys, east at least as far as the Nepean River (and therefore west of the Illawarra); while in the south, their territory extended at least as far as Goulburn, and possibly to Tumut. They were also referred to as the Mountain People, Nattai, Burragorang or Wollondilly Tribes. The Tharawal lived in the area around Botany Bay and southwards, in particular between La Perouse and Wreck Bay (near Jervis Bay). Neighbours with the Eora, Darug, Gundungurra and Yuin. The hill top and ridgeline at Collingwood is understood to have been a meeting place for the Tharawal, Dharug and Gundungurra peoples and a vantage point enabling Country to be observed and monitored. Aboriginal community members have advised that when meeting it was important for Aboriginal people to still be able to see their own country. It is also understood that this high point was used by Aboriginal people as a look out across the Georges River to the east and the mountains to the west. The lookout provided views across the landscape, which allowed for observations of weather patterns, movements, threats from fire and changes in seasonal vegetation. The \\"vista\\" from the high ground provides a view corridor southeast to the Georges River. Gavin Andrews explains: \\"The area was important because it's a high point and it was a place where different nations would meet, but also where people would look over the country = you could see everything in all directions from there...[and] it's right near the Georges River, which was the major method of transportation in the area.\\" Aboriginal community members have advised that Aboriginal artefacts have been found in the vicinity of the house and scarred trees were a feature of the Collingwood Estate. The Collingwood Precinct was listed as an Aboriginal Place, under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974, on 6 March 2009. The Aboriginal Place is associated with early engagement, and at times conflict, between colonial settlers and Aboriginal people. The American whaler, Captain Eber Bunker, constructed a large house, Collingwood House, in this location in 1810. Today, the Collingwood Precinct Aboriginal Place is important to Aboriginal people because the location and outlook provide a connection to Country and culture. The site also continues to be used as a meeting place for Aboriginal people. =Eber Bunker= In 1791, American captain Eber Bunker arrived in the colony as Master of the Third Fleet convict ship , a converted whaler. Bunker was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1761, a direct descendant of two families, the Tilleys and pilgrim John Howland. Bunker is regarded as the father of the Australian whaling industry. He is credited with capturing the first whales in Australian waters in October 1791. He is also credited with being one of the first exporters and traders in the colony. Bunker exported whale oil back to England and soap to Tahiti. He was also an early trader with New Zealand. He traded with Britain, India and China and exported seal fur taken from islands off Australia and New Zealand. Bunker also chartered part of the NSW coast (Queensland), the Bunker Islands off Gladstone and also parts of the south of the South Island of New Zealand. Bunker was also a member of the Vice Admiralty Court and a landholder at Bulanaming, Bankstown and the Hunter Valley. In 1801, Bunker was granted of land at Bulanaming near Petersham Hill in 1801. In 1803, sailing in with Lieutenant John Bowen, accompanied to establish a British settlement at Risdon Cove on the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land. Bunker received a grant at Liverpool from Governor King on 18 August 1804. This grant appears to have been made in payment for his assistance in escorting Bowen to Van Diemen's land. In 1806, Bunker brought his family to the colony aboard Elizabeth and lived at Bunker's Hill at The Rocks. In January 1808, Bunker was a signatory to a letter to Major George Johnston expressing support for his seizure of command of the Colony in the Rum Rebellion and recommending that he ensure that measures adopted for public security be confirmed by his successor. Bunker's first wife and mother to his six children, Margaret Thompson, died delivering a stillborn baby. Bunker married his second wife Margaret McFarlane (1780‚Äì1821), the widow of an English Army Officer in Bengal in 1810. Bunker received a further grant of 500 acres from Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810. =Development of Collingwood and Bunker ownership= In November 1810, Liverpool was established by Governor Macquarie. It quickly developed into a service area for the surrounding areas and travellers on the Liverpool Road. It remained the main town to the west of Sydney until Campbelltown, founded in 1820 further to the south, started to thrive. A track from Parramatta to Liverpool town site came into use . The construction date of the earliest phase of Bunker's Farm / Collingwood is unclear. The house was built of brick with a shingled roof. There were two rooms with two windows in each, and a hall between them. The ceilings were 12 feet high and the house was symmetrical with a brick chimney. The building features are typical of the early colonial Georgian period ‚Äì it has a simple rectangular shape, symmetrical facade, six panelled door, a chair rail around the wall, and entrance doorway with sidelights and semi circular fanlight. The fabric of the walls differs from the later sections of the house being built of sandstock brick (made by convicts from local clay) rather than from random rubble. The farm outbuildings are understood to have included a detached kitchen and store, stables, coach house, slaughter house, stock yards and convict huts. Many of the earliest out buildings are thought to have been located west of the house as the house was originally oriented towards the east looking out to the George's River. Early transport to the Bunker's Farm was by the George's River until the Great South Road opened in 1814. It would appear that the later presentation of the house to the west relates to the new transport route of the Great South Road. Records indicate that by 1814 Eber Bunker (when in the colony) and his second wife and two of his children were living at Collingwood. Margaret Bunker is understood to have run the farm (Bunker's Farm / Collingwood) while Bunker was at sea. The farm supplied fresh meat to the Government Stores. This would have been a lucrative contract. Bunker's seafaring days seem to have come to an end in 1816, when he came to Sydney as a ship's passenger. Margaret Bunker died aged 41 in 1821. In 1823 Eber Bunker married his third wife Ann Minchin (1775‚Äì1837), the widow of Captain William Minchin (1774‚Äì1821), holder of a land grant, Minchinbury, at Rooty Hill. The census return for 1828 indicates that Bunker and Ann were residing at the property with four convict servants (two women house servants and two male labourers). It is likely that the convicts would have shared two huts on the property. Assigned convicts worked and lived at Bunker's Farm / Collingwood for at least thirty years during the Bunker / Blackett ownership. They are likely to have provided the labour for construction of the house and outbuildings. In 1832, Captain Bunker was recorded as living at Collingwood, on the left of the road southwards from LiverpoolPO Directory, 1832 Bunker died at Collingwood on 27 September 1836, aged 74.V1836807 20/1836 The published death notice referred to him as one of the oldest and most respected inhabitants of the colony. His standing was illustrated through intermarriage of his daughters with well known families such as the Laycocks and Fisks, his friendship with Thomas Moore and Charles Throsby and a visit by Governor Macquarie and his wife Elizabeth Macquarie. Anne Bunker died aged 62 in 1837. The property passed to Bunker's daughter Charlotte Blackett (1804‚Äì1851) who was living with her husband George Blackett at Collingwood. Another daughter, Isabella was married to Thomas Lycock Junior of \\"Kelvin\\" at Bringelly. Charlotte Blackett's husband George experienced serious financial difficulty during the 1840s depression, having invested heavily in improvement to the estate, including a flour mill (the Collingwood Flour Mill) near the Georges River. The mill reputedly cost 15,000 pounds. Consequently, the property was sold between 1842‚Äì1845 to repay George Blackett's debts An insolvency inventory indicates that by 1842 Collingwood had at least six rooms. The details of the furniture suggest a lifestyle of genteel privilege. There was furniture for a drawing room, a dining room, and another room that was possibly a parlour, and three bedrooms. =Gordon and Atkinson ownership= Samuel Deane Gordon purchased Collingwood in 1845 for 17,000 pounds. Gordon was a wealthy merchant who owned large stores in Sydney and Liverpool. He was successful in his mercantile and pastoral activities despite the economic decline that followed the end of the convict system in NSW. Gordon was a founding Councillor of St Andrews College in the 1870s at the University of Sydney, and was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1856 and to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1861. Gordon did not live at Collingwood. He rented the house and grounds from 1845. Gordon sold his Liverpool store in 1848 and later sold Collingwood in 1853. James Henry Atkinson purchased Collingwood Estate in 1853. Atkinson was a wool and produce agent with a stores at Circular Quay, an entrepreneur and politician. He was a significant figure in the formation of the Cumberland Agricultural Society, which was later to become the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales. The first meeting called with the object of forming this Society was held at the Terminus Hotel in Liverpool and chaired by Atkinson. Organisers included leading settlers and political figures of the County of Cumberland. The first agricultural show organised by this Society took place at Collingwood in 1858. It attracted a range of cattle, imported as well as colonial-bred, horses, pigs, sheep, poultry, wool and farm produce. In addition, farm implements of \\"sterling utility\\" were displayed. Many \\"were well adapted\\" to local circumstances and \\"demonstrated the care with which ingenuity had been applied to this important branch of science\\".(Fletcher, 1988, 45, 47) Atkinson was a member of the NSW Legislative Assembly for Central Cumberland from 1858 until 1863. He bought Collingwood as an investment because of its close proximity to the proposed southern railway line from Parramatta to Liverpool. The coming of the railway to Liverpool in 1856 generated new industries and activities centred around Collingwood. Atkinson built a private siding to the Collingwood industrial area near Blackett's Collingwood Flour Mill. Atkinson developed the estate as a depot for the transfer of pastoral and agricultural produce. He built a large railway store, an abattoir, stock and sales yards. Soon after, a woolwash and Fellmongery (for tanning hides and pelts) and paper mill were built. Atkinson planned to develop an industrial estate on the property based on the English mill-town model. He built a series of terrace-style workers cottages in Nagle Street (then called Collingwood Street). During Atkinson's ownership Collingwood was extensively refurbished in 1857. The second storey, verandahs and a new kitchen block were added at that time. Atkinson subdivided the estate in 1859, retaining the industrial and commercial components, but selling the homestead and the undeveloped land. William Weaver, architect and engineer was Colonial (Government) Architect for 18 months from 1855‚Äì6. On 1 April 1856 Weaver, aged 28, began private practice at 25 Pitt Street. The colonial economy was prospering, the new Sydney Railway was running as far as Liverpool and suburban development encouraged speculative building. Weaver's largest single contract was commissioned by Atkinson, for the Collingwood Abattoir complex. Collingwood house today is the only surviving section of this major project which must have well expressed the current mood of reckless colonial optimism and which later led Atkinson to insolvency. It included slaughtering houses, yards, a two-storey brick Railway Store with cedar fittings, a three-storey brick steam flour mill, a miller's cottage, an ironbark and pine salting house, a brick boiling-down house, internal roads, a rail link and irrigation system. Four identical cottages to house twenty workers and their families were of Gothic design with decorative stonework, gables and bargeboards. An architectural irony which highlights the speculative enthusiasm of 1856 was noted by a reporter in \\"Empire\\", writing about the Collingwood Piggery, that it: \\"will accommodate 500 of these animals...and the provision for the good condition of the pigs is most complete: indeed, their dwellings have a far more tasteful exterior than those of many whose food they will become.\\" The specialised requirements of the abattoir would have well-used Weaver's architectural and engineering talents. The kitchen block appears on plans in its original form in 1862, 1869 and 1880, but this is incorrect for at least the 1880 plan as the current kitchen wing is visible in a 1875 photograph. It is likely the plans are inaccurate and are only reliable for establishing the presence or absence of structures and not their layout.Casey & Lowe, 2015, 3 =Gillespie, Samuel and Ashcroft ownership= James Gillespie purchased Collingwood Estate (the Homestead and undeveloped land) from Atkinson in 1859. Gillespie lived in the house with his wife Margaret and his three children. Gillespie was a trustee of the Presbyterian Church. The Australian Paper Company purchased 8 hectares (20 acres) of land on the river banks between Collingwood House and Atkinson Street from Gillespie in 1864. Machinery was brought from England and paper was manufactured from rags and reeds from the Georges River. The rags collected were stored in the old Collingwood flour mill. The factory which is reputed to be the first large paper mill in Australia became for a time the largest employer of men, women and children in Liverpool. Sir Saul Samuel (1820‚Äì1900) purchased Collingwood Estate in 1869. Like James Henry Atkinson he bought up large areas of land in Liverpool, centred around the old Collingwood Estate. Saul Samuel was a businessman and member of both houses of Parliament between 1854 and 1880.MLA from 1854 to 1856, 1858 to 1860 and 1862 to 1872. MLC from 1872 until 1880 He was the first Jewish Magistrate, Parliamentarian and Minister of the Crown in NSW. Samuel was Colonial Treasurer and Postmaster-General on three occasions each, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Government Representative in the Legislative Council. Samuel was knighted in 1880 and appointed Agent-General in London. Samuel expanded the Collingwood Industrial area. He developed the most advanced wool washing processes in Australia and invented a machine for removing burrs from fleece. The bakehouse appears to have been demolished by 1880 where it is absent on plan. By 1886 Samuel's wool scour had been sold to Henry Haigh who was operating a wool scour at Moorebank. Saul Samuel does not appear to have lived at Collingwood. During his ownership of the Collingwood Estate, the house was leased to a number of notable tenants including: William Russell Wilson Bligh; Joseph Wearne Jnr; Charles Bull; and John Vigar Bartlett. Sir Saul Samuel died in 1900 and Collingwood remained part of his estate until 1910. Edward James Ashcroft purchased Collingwood from Sir Saul Samuel's estate in 1910. Ashcroft was a successful wholesale butcher, exporter and onetime mayor of Liverpool. Ashcroft lived at Collingwood with his daughter and son in law Eva and George Prince. During the Ashcroft occupancy the Collingwood lands were used for resting and fattening stock, ready for slaughter at the Ashcroft slaughter yards west of the town. The Ashcrofts owned a butchery at the corner of Macquarie and Memorial Avenue. Under the Ashcroft's ownership Collingwood was modified and new features were added including a bull nosed iron roof to the verandah, a gable over the sitting room window, and the enclosing of the back verandah. =Liverpool Golf Course= When E. J. Ashcroft died 80 hectares (200 acres) of the Collingwood property were leased to Mr Frank Crowe to create the Liverpool Golf Course. Golf was becoming increasingly popular after the First World War. The course designed by Tommy Howard was opened in 1931. A club was formed and Dr R. A. Lovejoy was elected the first president. The club started with a membership of less than 20, but by 1939, there were 92 members and 36 associates. Many prominent Liverpool families became foundation members including the Marsden, Buckland, Clink, Wych, Hamer, Prince, Cornes, Fitzpatrick, Kershler and Webb families. Women were admitted to the course from its inception. Collingwood House was used as the club house. In the mid 1930s, the course was extended from 9 to 18 holes. The Liverpool Golf Club bought the Collingwood Estate in 1951 and undertook alterations to the house. A 1964 proposal by the Department of Main Roads to build an expressway through the golf course, led the Board of the Liverpool Golf Club to approve a plan to sell the course and look for an alternative site. The golf course was sold in 1969 and approval was granted to rezone the land for residential subdivision. A condition of the sale was that Collingwood House and the surrounding land be given to Liverpool City Council for restoration. The last competitive golf match was played at Collingwood on 18 July 1971. =Liverpool City Council ownership= In 1973‚Äì74, Collingwood House ('Captain Bunker's Cottage') was restored by Heritage Architect, Clive Lucas at a cost of $72,148.00. Works included a re-created garden setting (designed by James Broadbent, recognised expert in colonial gardens, from the Historic Houses Trust, in collaboration with Clive Lucas Stapleton & Partners) within a larger, parkland precinct. At that time everyone including the National Trust of Australia (NSW) thought 'Captain Bunker's Cottage' was the kitchen block. A subdivision had been done to isolate this building. Clive Lucas determined, on close building inspection, that it was the building next door that contained the house built by Eber Bunker in the second decade of the 19th century and not the building earmarked in 1973 for conservation. The kitchen block was later proved to have been built 1865, some 30 years after Bunker's death. The restored Collingwood was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon Gough Whitlam, M.P., on 6 September 1975. Since 1975 Collingwood House has operated as a house museum under the management of the Liverpool Regional Museum. The Royal Australian Institute of Architects (NSW Division) awarded the inaugural \\"Greenway Award\\" to Collingwood in 1979. On 3 July 2009, Collingwood Precinct Aboriginal Place was declared under the National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974. National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974 by then Minister for Climate Change and the Environment, Carmel Tebbutt. This recognised the special significance of the Aboriginal Place include the ridge line \\"high ground\\" view meeting place for the Dharawal, Gandangara and Dharug people, which was also a vantage point during the pre-contact era enabling country to be observed and monitored. The place is associated with early engagement, and at times conflict, between European settlers and Aboriginal peoples. The \\"vista\\" from the high ground provides a corridor southeast to the Georges River across remnant native vegetation and riverine environment. The house is available for tours by appointment only.  Description  The house Collingwood House is located on a small block of elevated land that is truncated at the rear (due to residential subdivision) but has some remnant garden and open space to the west. The open space provides vistas of the house from the roadway and retains its historic link with Liverpool Road. The complex sits in garden with some mature trees, including very tall and wide lemon-scented gums (Corymbia citriodora), forest red gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis), a younger but mature honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), brush box (Lophostemon confertus), white quince (Alectryon subcinereus), coral tree (Erythrina x sykesii), young Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and pepper(corn) tree (Schinus molle var.areira). Some of these date to a garden restoration undertaken with advice from James Broadbent in the late 1980s. Collingwood comprises two buildings, the house and the kitchen block. ;House ( 1820s) A \\"conglomerate\\" single storey house with two attic rooms and a hipped roof verandah to three elevations, encircling verandah and single storey detached service wing. The original five bay house (originally hipped roof), built by Captain Bunker, forms the front section of the present complex. It features Colonial/Georgian character fanlights and sidelights around the main door. The house was added to about 1860 with a gabled section, giving an early Victorian quality. ;Kitchen Block ( 1865) The service block appears to have been rebuilt about 1865. = Modifications and dates = * 1811 ‚Äì The oldest section of the house may date somewhere between 1810 and 1812. The exact year of construction is a source of much conjecture, and further research is required to clarify the construction date. The earliest section of the house appears to exemplify Governor Macquarie's strict building controls introduced by decree on 26 December 1810. It was built of brick with a shingled roof. There were two rooms with two windows in each, and a hall between them. The 12 foot high ceilings exceeded Macquarie's rule of 10 foot. The house was symmetrical with a brick chimney. The building features are thought to be typical of the early colonial Georgian period ‚Äì it has a simple rectangular shape, symmetrical facade, six panelled door, a chair rail around the wall, and entrance doorway with sidelights and semi circular fanlight. The fabric of the walls was made of sandstock brick (made by convicts from local clay). The house was later extended to seven rooms. * 1840s ‚Äì Substantial improvements were made to the estate by George Blackett including a flour mill (the Collingwood Flour Mill) near the Georges River. * 1845 ‚Äì It is thought that another room was added by George Blackett to the south western corner of the house prior to 1845. * 1856 ‚Äì Due to the proximity of the Collingwood Estate to the new railway linking Parramatta and Liverpool new industries were developed around and on the estate. James Henry Atkinson developed the Collingwood Estate as a depot for the transfer of pastoral and agricultural produce. He built a private railway siding, large railway store, an abattoir, stock and sale yards, a wool wash, Fellmongery and paper mill. Atkinson also built a series of terrace like workers cottages in Nagle Street (then Collingwood Street). * 1857 ‚Äì Collingwood House was renovated by the Architect William Weaver. A second storey and verandahs were added, and a new kitchen block built. * 1859 ‚Äì The Collingwood Estate was subdivided by James Henry Atkinson. * 1864‚Äì68 ‚Äì The Australian Paper Company built a large paper mill on land on the river banks between Collingwood House and Atkinson Street. * 1910 ‚Äì Alterations were made to the house during the Ashcroft family's ownership. These included the addition of a bull nosed iron roof to the veranda, a gable over the sitting room window, and the enclosing of the back verandah. * 1951 ‚Äì Alterations were made to the house including an extension to the southern side of the house during the ownership of the Liverpool Golf Course. The house was used as the Club House. * 1969 ‚Äì The Liverpool Golf Course was sold and the land subdivided for houses. * 1973/4 ‚Äì Collingwood House was restored by Heritage Architect, Clive Lucas at a cost of $72,148.00. Works included re-instated garden designed by James Broadbent in collaboration with Clive Lucas, Stapelton & Partners. * 1982-4: Some restoration carried out by Bill Cummings, such as laying of plush red carpet throughout the house. * 1989‚Äì2001 Roach family era: the verandah was paved with sandstone block, but these needed to be replaced due to subsistence. The verandah was resurfaced in tiles, which are present today on several surfaces throughout the property. The bathrooms were all gutted at this time with none of the original fabric kept. The massive bathtub was removed. Around this time the courtyard at the rear of the house was concreted.Weekend Advocate 2002:12 * : restoration work undertaken by the Munros, including covering the chimneys and repairing the roof as birds had overrun the house. A rising damp problem in the dining room was repaired due to the previous owners concreting the courtyard and covering essential vents. Other work that may have been carried out by the Munros includes installation of the existing entrance gate and fence, and polishing the floorboards under the carpets on the staircase and bedrooms.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Collingwood House Estate is of State significance as a remnant cultural landscape demonstrating the layers of Indigenous and non Indigenous use and occupation and the significant transition of the place from an agricultural estate to an industrial estate during the nineteenth century. The high point of the ridgeline at Collingwood is of historic and contemporary social significance to the Tharawal and the Gundungurra peoples as a meeting place for the two Aboriginal nations, from which each respective nation could remain within sight of their country. The estate originally known as Bunker's Farm is associated with the early economic development of Liverpool, which was established as a town by Governor Macquarie in 1810. One of the earliest and largest land grants in the Liverpool region, Bunker's Farm played an important role in the development of agriculture and early industries in the colony. The location of the farm in relation to the Georges River and the railway which arrived from Parramatta in 1856 encouraged commercial speculation, and the development of new industries on the estate lands. The place is significantly associated with its original builder the American Loyalist, mariner and trader Captain Eber Bunker (1761‚Äì1836). Captain Bunker who arrived in Port Jackson in 1791, as Master of the Third Fleet convict ship the \\"William and Anne\\", is regarded as the founder of the Australian whaling industry, and is also credited with being one of the colony's first exporters and traders. Bunker assisted in establishing the British settlement on the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land in 1803, and also chartered part of the far northern NSW coast (now Queensland), the Bunker Islands off Gladstone and also part of the South Island of New Zealand. Bunker built his house around c.1810 on an estate at Liverpool granted to him between 1804‚Äì10 by Governors King and Macquarie. The Collingwood Estate was owned and/or occupied by several important colonial figures prominent in the fields of agriculture, commerce and law, including: Samuel Dean Gordon; James Henry Atkinson; and Sir Saul Samuel. Samuel Dean Gordon who owned the estate in the mid 1840s was a successful merchant and pastoralist. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1856 and to the Legislative Council in 1861. James Henry Atkinson, who owned the estate from the 1850s was a wool merchant, entrepreneur and politician. Atkinson was a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Central Cumberland from 1858 until 1863. Atkinson speculated and capitalised on the arrival of the railway, developing the Collingwood Estate as a depot for the transfer of pastoral and agricultural produce. Atkinson developed Collingwood as an industrial estate based on the English mill-town model. Sir Saul Samuel (1820‚Äì1900) who owned the estate from the late 1860s until the turn of the century was a businessman and member of both houses of Parliament between 1854 and 1880. Samuel was the first Jewish Magistrate, Parliamentarian and Minister of the Crown in NSW. Samuel was knighted in 1880 and appointed Agent-General in London. Samuel expanded the Collingwood Industrial area. He developed the most advanced wool washing processes in Australia and invented a machine for removing burrs from fleece. The house complex is a rare example of modified colonial Georgian residence that demonstrates the evolution of domestic colonial architecture and its adaptation to the Australian environment from the earliest stage of the Macquarie period (1810‚Äì21) to the 1860s. It is one of only a small number of houses that remain from the Macquarie period, and one of the earliest examples conforming to the strict building code relating to materials, form, dimensions and siting decreed by Governor Macquarie on 26 December 1810. The fabric of the house exhibits a range of early building techniques that are found few other houses in New South Wales. The evolution of the house in terms of its fabric, dimensions and layout, is illustrative of the social and economic standing of its owners within the colony, their resources, and the genteel lifestyle to which they aspired. Collingwood was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 8 December 2006.

He competed in college for Buffalo and Arizona State. Early life and high school career Evans is the son of Shannon and Armona Evans. He was a multi-sport athlete growing up, playing cornerback and receiver in football as well as playing center field in baseball, though basketball remained his favorite. At Nansemond River High School, Evans was coached by Ed Young, and the two had a contentious relationship. He joined the varsity team as a sophomore but Young sent him down to junior varsity since he did not think Evans was ready. As a junior, Evans started the season as a bench player but joined the starting lineup after scoring 27 points in his first start. He received some college looks after his senior season, but his SAT scores did not qualify him for a college scholarship, so he opted for a postgraduate year at prep school Hargrave Military Academy. His parents, grandparents, and great-aunt helped him pay for tuition, with his mother cashing out her 401(k) account. Evans received scholarship offers before his first game and committed to Buffalo. College career At Buffalo, Evans averaged 8.5 points per game. He averaged 15.4 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game as a sophomore, shooting 38 percent from the three-point line, and led the Bulls to their first NCAA Tournament. Evans was named to the Second-team All-MAC. After his sophomore season, Buffalo coach Bobby Hurley was hired at Arizona State, and Evans decided to follow him despite his mother's objections. As a junior, Evans was second to Tra Holder on the team with 15.0 points per game and was fifth in the conference in assists with 4.4 a game. Evans began his senior season well, scoring 22 points in a win over Xavier on November 24, 2017. Evans scored 22 points in a win against Kansas two weeks later and was named Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week. Evans's shooting then fell off, and he missed 15 consecutive 3-point attempts at one point. He averaged 16.5 points, 3.3 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game and led Arizona State to the NCAA Tournament. As a senior, Evans was named Honorable Mention All-Pac-12. Professional career After going undrafted in the 2018 NBA draft, Evans played for the Houston Rockets in the NBA Summer League. In August 2018, he signed with Atomer≈ëm≈± SE of the Hungarian league. On June 23, 2020, Evans signed with √âlan B√©arnais of the French LNB Pro A.

Early life Connor was born in Waterford, Ireland around 1874 (although numerous versions of her name and date of birth exist, the Australian Dictionary of Biography says she was \\"possibly\\" born on 14 November 1874). Her father, John McCarthy, was a mariner, and Connor stated that after he was lost at sea when she was aged 2, she lived with family in England, then emigrated to the United States, and later to New Zealand. At the age of 16, she met and married Edward Connor (O'Connor), an English-born labourer, with the couple eloping to Melbourne, Australia. Police career Connor's husband Edward died suddenly in 1916, and Connor came to the attention of Victoria Police when his death was registered. Later that year, she began working for the police force, investigating illegal gambling and residing undercover in a boarding house to gather evidence against a notorious criminal. In 1917, after a campaign by women's groups to appoint women as police members, Connor was the first of two women to be appointed 'police agents', essentially a type of special constable with half the salary and no powers of arrest, uniform or weapon. Connor led a group of female agents and watch-house matrons, and advocated for the appointment of women to Victoria Police, which occurred on 12 November 1924 when she and three other female police agents were officially sworn in as police officers, with equal pay and arrest powers. Due to a quirk of police regulations, Connor lost her senior status in the force and was considered a junior officer. She was forced to retire on 14 November 1929, and was ineligible for a police pension as she had not served the requisite fifteen years as a sworn officer, so she utilised her detective skills as a private investigator. Connor died on 12 October 1952 at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, and was buried at Boroondara General Cemetery in Kew. In August 2017, Victorian Police Minister Lisa Neville and Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton unveiled a plaque at the cemetery commemorating her role as a pioneer of women in policing, and in November that year, a statue of Connor was unveiled at the Victoria Police Academy.

The heritage buildings on site were built from 1939. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013.  History  Military camp, Ingleburn, 1939 The Military Heritage Precinct and Mont St Quentin Oval is part of the former Defence Site which was originally established in 1939 on 276.8 ha of land. The Defence site expanded to cover an area 311 ha during its use as a Defence site. =The Ingleburn Defence Site= The majority of the land on which the Ingleburn Defence site was located was first granted to the first colonial surveyor, James Meeham by Governor Macquarie in the 1816. The estate, then named \\"Macquarie Fields\\", was purchased by Samuel Terry in 1831. Terry added to the estate which remained in the Terry family until 1877. At this time the land was subdivided with the largest land parcel, which later contained part of the Defence site, being purchased by James Ashcroft. Subsequently, the intact estate was purchased by member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Alexander Ross in 1904 and was subdivided into two land parcels in 1917. The parcel which later contained the Defence site remained in the Ross family and was purchased by Frederick Moore in 1927. Moore added land to the estate and then subdivided it into a mix of small town allotments, small farm allotments and larger parcels of about 100 acres. By 1939 only a few of the allotments had been sold off.(Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd, Hoxton Park Recycled Water Scheme October 2008) The onset of hostilities in Europe in 1939 and Australia's entry into World War II in September 1939 instigated the rapid expansion of both the Permanent Military Forces and the Citizens Military Forces, (CMF). From September 1939 volunteers from the CMF began their one-month training for service in Australia and its Territories and another 20,000 volunteers formed the Second Australian Infantry Force. This expansion and the introduction of universal conscription requiring all single men of 21 years of age to undergo military training in preparation for active service created the need to establish a significant network of military training facilities. The Liverpool site, where army training occurred during World War II, was inadequate for the additional training required by the increasingly technological nature of warfare in preparation for WWII. It was the recognition of these factors that led to the identification and establishment of the Ingleburn Defence Site as suitable and plans were drawn up for the site in 1939. The 276.8 hectare parcel of land at Ingleburn was selected as the site for the first purpose built army training defence site in Australia. The land was acquired by compulsory resumption, formally gazetted in May 1940, yet the camp received its first recruits on 1 November 1939, long before the 333 buildings comprising the WWII training facility were completed. The facilities constructed included barrack accommodation, officers' quarters, mess halls, Sergeant's offices and mess, Officers mess, ablution blocks, latrines, administration offices, transport facilities. The sleeping barracks, mess halls and offices were usually P1 type wooden huts. Recruits arriving at Ingleburn received basic training and further specialised training. At Ingleburn they were trained to work as a battalion which was followed by training at Liverpool, to work as a company. Ingleburn Defence Site also played a major role in the formation of military units, prior to their dispatch to active service during WWII. It was here at Ingleburn that the first troops to see active service in WWII, the 16th Brigade of the 6th division of the Second AIF, was formed. On 3 January 1941, the Australian forces broke the defences of the Italian forces at the Battle of Bardia. The town of Bardia fell to the Australians 2 days later. Thousands of prisoners of War were taken as well as valuable supplies. Another Battalion of noted service during WWII to have formed at Ingleburn was the 2/13th Battalion known as \\"The devils own\\" because of their involvement in the eight month Siege of Tobruk. These are only 2 of the units to have seen distinguished active service which formed at Ingleburn during WWII. The Mont St Quentin Oval was initially used as the main parade ground for the Ingleburn Army Camp prior to the establishment of more parade grounds around the Defence site. It was also initially the place troops were officially farewelled on their dispatch overseas and also the place they were welcomed back on their return from active service. It was from Ingleburn that many troops were demobilised. In 1941 with the establishment of the Australian Women's Army Service, Ingleburn expanded its training role to train female recruits. Women between the ages of 18 and 45 years trained in auxiliary roles such as drivers (military vehicles including 3-ton trucks), orderlies and in clerical positions. In addition to this Ingleburn was the site of the First Field Hospital an adjunct of which, the central military hospital provided training and an assembly point for field medical units. At the end of WWII, the frenetic war time activity at the Ingleburn Defence Site abated and some land was leased out to local farmers. Nevertheless, the site still retained a military function becoming the home of the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. It was later home to the 4th and the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment. The role of Ingleburn Army Camp as a training facility and in forming military units for overseas service was boosted with Australia's involvement in the Korean War from 1951 to 1953. Battalions bound for Korea were stationed at Ingleburn. One of the most marked changes to the site at this time was the introduction of housing for married personnel in areas set out as villages or suburbs. Bardia and Block H (later Valley View) villages were established on the Ingleburn Defence Site at this time. On the initiative of a number of servicemen's wives, a creche was set up and allocated one of the P1 type huts for their activities. Originally, residents from the barracks had to travel to Campbelltown or Liverpool to shop necessitating a trip of over an hour. This was the motivation for establishing the Bambi creche. It initially offered 4 morning and 5 afternoon sessions per week. Since its establishment it has grown with the addition of two more huts and has become a fully accredited childcare service offering services to the defence community and later the broader community. Also in 1951, Ingleburn became a major centre for training for recruits of the reintroduced compulsory National Service scheme. This coupled with the Korean War activities, led to the expansion and development of the site and by the 1960s facilities included sporting fields, vehicle parks, a substantial recreation and training facility for the National Service men comprising 3 Romney Huts modified and assembled around a courtyard and much attention to landscaping of the camp with the planting of local and introduced species. Training of National Service men remained a dominant role through the 1950s, when national servicemen were not required to serve overseas but provided a home defence and through the 1960s, when this policy changed and conscripts were expected to serve in the Vietnam War. It was during this latter period that Ingleburn became associated with the anti war movement as many conscientious objectors were locked up in the Bardia guard house and cell block before being transported to the Military Prison at Holsworthy. In 1972 National Service was abolished thus ending Ingleburn's role in training for national servicemen. From 1973 to 1998 the Ingleburn Defence Site was a place of training for the largest troop of the Australian Army Reserve. In addition, during the 1970s it housed the Military Police. From 1990 when 93 ha to the north of the site was sold to Landcom, the military uses of the site were wound down and vacant buildings sold or demolished. The site was vacated by the end of 2000. =Military Heritage Precinct= The Military Heritage Precinct was established in 2002 by Defence as a national memorial providing a focus for memorial and commemoration days, catering for private visits and community use. It conserves a selection of representative examples of buildings and memorials of significance. The establishment of the Military Heritage Precinct was a means of consolidating some of the remaining heritage assets on the site into one area. It contains memorials, the guard house and cell blocks, the former Chaplain's and Post Offices and three P1 huts, the gate house and three P1 type huts. The huts which were constructed in the 1950s for the Chaplain's Office and former military Post Office facilities are associated with the Korean War. The three earlier (1939-1945) P1 huts are examples of the style that provided the barracks accommodation and also administrative buildings. Of the three earlier barrack huts remaining in the Military Heritage Precinct, one is now used as a museum. The museum hut is a replacement for a similar hut which was in particularly poor condition. Several of the early buildings from the establishment period still stand at Ingleburn remain in the Military Heritage Precinct. The formal entrance gates with two brick sentry posts, small check point hut immediately behind the gates and a main guard house were constructed early in the war, certainly by 1942. The cell block located behind the guard house and containing ten cells was a later addition in 1949. =Memorials= The Military Heritage Precinct has several relocated memorials to those who served at the military base. A \\"Memorial Grove\\" of commemorative pine plantings was dedicated in 1987. Originally located outside the precinct, they were relocated there in 2002. It included a commemorative garden surrounding a rectangular sandstone column with a brass plaque commemorating members of Bardia Barracks who died while on posting at that location. A memorial grove of pine planting was dedicated in 1987. A memorial to National Servicemen was inaugurated in 1997 and is the focus of ongoing annual commemorative celebrations. A memorial wall built in 2002 commemorates all infantry and training groups posted to Bardia Barracks. A paved area in the form of the \\"Rising Sun\\" badge along with plinth and flag poles serves as a memorial to the 16th Brigade which first assembled at Ingleburn in November 1939 and which went on to serve with distinction in the Middle East, Greece and Papua New Guinea, Crete, Syria, and Libya. The most recent addition to the Military Heritage Precinct is a concrete statue in the form of a soldier, shown resting on arms reversed, which was moved from the closed Lakemba Returned Soldiers' Club to Ingleburn in 2008. It was originally unveiled in 1923. The former Chaplain's Office at the Military Heritage Precinct is used for educational purposes, especially for visiting schools, and for meeting purposes. The former military Post Office is likewise used for visitors and the National Servicemen's Association members involved with maintaining and developing the memorial nature of the precinct. =Mont St Quentin Oval= The Mont St Quentin Oval is now considered to be closely associated with the Military Heritage Precinct. The Oval was a sports field prior to the establishment of the Ingleburn Defence Site and was initially used as the first parade ground on the Defence Site. Its use as a parade ground ceased as formal parade grounds were established on the site and it became a recreation oval for the Defence Site. The hospital entry posts from the former First Field Hospital at the Ingleburn Defence Site were relocated to stand at the oval after the demolition of the hospital in 1997.  Description  The Military Heritage Precinct was established in 2002 to conserve and represent the major heritage values of the larger former Ingleburn Defence Site. The precinct is enclosed by a green metal palisade fence and service road and the boundary incorporates the original white masonry gateposts and guard posts of the Bardia Barracks (the former name of this part of the Ingleburn Defence Site). The formal entrance gates form a large part of the southern perimeter of the precinct and include two sentry boxes of red brick, painted white internally, with white bargeboards and terracotta tiled gable roofs. An original guard station located behind the central masonry column of the entrance gates is a timber framed, weatherboard structure with a corrugated iron gable roof of corrugated iron. The gates are constructed of three white painted masonry pillars (approximately 4m tall) with embossed lettering \\"BARDIA\\" running vertically down the west column and \\"BARRACKS\\" down the east column. The entrance driveway is lined with a redbrick dwarf wall to either side. Small stone walls form part of the driveway and are located on either side of the entrance between the sentry boxes and entry gates. Manicured ornamental plantings sit in planter boxes behind the stone walls = Elements within the precinct = Memorials Five memorials have been relocated in the Military Heritage Precinct of which the most imposing is the memorial wall, located west of the guard house. This memorial was constructed concurrently with the establishment of the precinct and is in memory of all infantry and training groups that were posted to the Defence site. This memorial is a sloping, semicircular rendered concrete wall with a central flagpole and granite base. The interior of the wall is lined by marble plaques citing the names of all units identified as having served at the Defence site. North west of the entrance stands the 16th Australian Infantry Brigade memorial. It consists of six flagpoles and, in plan view, the concrete base of the memorial is shaped like the rising sun reflecting the Australian Army badge. This is an elaborate monument comprising a rectangular concrete slab set on a concrete plinth, with an inscription stone attached to its south face. The stone is inscribed in black lettering and records the Battle Honours of the unit from 1940 to 1945. The official National Servicemen's Memorial is located east of two of the P1 type huts. This memorial is the focus of commemorative celebrations such as Bardia Day, an annual event at the site usually held in the first week in August. It is surrounded by five flagpoles set in a semicircle around the monument at a radius of about 3m and has a central white brick plinth on which a large stone, inlaid with a plaque, is placed. Small box planter beds are located on either side of this central stone. The Memorial Grove, dedicated in 1987, is located in the north east section of the site. It includes commemorative pine plantings which surround a rectangular sandstone column. The monument includes a brass plaque bearing the names of soldiers who were killed in training at the Bardia Barracks The most recent addition to the precinct is the concrete soldier, which was relocated to the precinct in 2008. There are also three decommissioned Army guns located within the precinct, a Gofors antiaircraft gun and two artillery guns, a 25-pounder and a Howitzer. Interpretive signage has been installed in the precinct to explain the history of the precinct and its elements. Guard House The guard house and its cell block are located adjacent to the entrance gates. The guardhouse was constructed in 1939 and is currently used as a kitchenette and breakout area for the 24 hour security presence on the site. It is a timber framed, weatherboard clad building with a corrugated iron hipped roof. A verandah supported by timber posts is located at the front of the building which is painted cream and has a green corrugated hipped roof with a verandah extension. The building has been updated incrementally, with minor additions such as aluminium windows and upgrades to internal services. Cell Block The cell block is a later addition to the guard house and contains a concrete exercise yard. Constructed in 1949, the building features heavy timber doors to each of the 10 cells which retain their original configuration. Former Chaplains Office The former Chaplains Office is a weatherboard clad structure, slightly elevated from the ground, with a fairly new corrugated metal roof. The single roomed building retains it original windows and doors. Air conditioning units have recently been added to allow the building to be used for educational purposes and as a meeting room. Former Military Post Office The former military Post Office is a converted P1 type hut dating from the period between 1950 and 1959. It has a skillion verandah extension to the gabled, corrugated iron roof. It comprises a single room and is externally clad with weatherboard. There are several timber bench seats attached to the facade and concrete and metal disabled access ramps have recently been added and a small barbecue shelter has been constructed between this building and the car parking area. P1 Type Huts There are three almost identical P1 type huts located in the north west corner of the precinct. They are located in an arrangement and painted in identical colour schemes of cream and mission brown with new grey corrugated metal roofs. These huts were retained in the precinct as representative examples and to conserve their heritage values as a building type. For the purpose of their heritage listing the huts are referred to as Huts 1, 2 and 3. P1 type Huts 2 and 3 date from the period 1939 - 1946 and feature entry doors at each end of the building and three casement paned windows. These huts have a triangular lattice vent below the gable at each end of the building. Internally the huts are of a simple rectangular floor plan. Hut 3 is currently used as a museum for educational tours and open days . Displays include a mock soldiers bed and kit as well as military uniforms, photographs and other paraphernalia. There have been no major alterations to this building. Hut 1 is a P1 type hut dating form the period 1950 - 1956. This more recent style hut contains double hung windows, overlapping weatherboards and a small rectangular louvered gable vent. The entrance doors are located on the side of the building. Hut 1 and 2 are currently used for storage. Mont St Quentin Oval The Mont St Quentin Oval is located on the opposite side of Campbelltown Road to the Military Heritage Precinct and is currently managed as part of the Military Heritage Precinct. The entrance to the oval is marked by the original oval gate posts. The road entrance is now marked by the former hospital gates, relocated to the precinct from the First Field Hospital which was demolished in 1997. The Oval retains the viewing dais and parade ground steps associated with its use as a parade ground during WWII. =Condition= The guard house, cell block, former Chaplain's Office, former Post Office and Huts 1, 2 and 3 were reported to be generally well presented and in good condition as at 9 April 2011. The guard house and cell block building has been updated incrementally, yet the layout remains largely intact and the building is of high integrity. The cell block, a possible later addition to the building, has the cells in their original configuration and the interior of the cells is intact, with a timber bed, small window and a hatch on the door. The former Chaplain's Office is generally of high integrity and contains all of its original windows and doors. The former military post office is well presented and in good condition with the original windows and doors intact also. Hut 3, currently being used as the precinct museum, has had no major alterations to the fabric of the building. Huts 1 and 2 are currently being used for storage but are intact.  Heritage listing  The Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct and Mont St Quentin Oval is of heritage significance as the entry point and command precinct of the first purpose built military training camp for WWII. The camp later became known as Ingleburn Defence site. The Ingleburn Defence site was also the place from where the first Australian troops to see active service in WWII at the town of Bardia, (the 16th Brigade of the 6th Division of the Second AIF) formed up. The Mont St Quentin Oval was most likely to be initially utilised as a parade ground for WWII troops at the site and was where the troops were formally farewelled before being shipped overseas, prior to the construction of official parade grounds . It is also of significance as one of the States key defence sites which coordinated the formation, training and dispatch of troops for most theatres of warfare during the 20th century. The site's heritage significance is enhanced through its association with many military units which gave distinguished service in WWII such as the 16th Brigade of the 6th Division of the Second AIF, the first Australian unit to see armed conflict and the 2/13th Battalion variously known as the \\"devils own\\" or the \\"rats of Tobruk\\" for their determined fighting during the Siege of Tobruk. It also has historic associations with units fighting in the Korean War and the Vietnam War as well as with other social trends during the Vietnam War such as the anti-war lobby. It is of State heritage significance for its association with generations of ex-servicemen who have passed through the site either en route to active service in overseas theatres of war or for National Service training. Items within the precinct and the Mont St Quentin are imbued with symbolic meaning for those associated with the place. The Bardia Barracks Entrance Gates symbolise the entrance to army life and the brick sentry boxes are symbolic of the long term military presence on site. The Military Heritage Precinct established in 2002, is also significant as a good representative example of a command precinct for a large Army training site in NSW and Australia. The P1 type huts, guard house and cells as well as the former parade ground with its entry gates and viewing dais are characteristic of military infrastructure and are able to demonstrate the principal characteristics of military training sites. The Military Heritage Precinct and Mont St Quentin Oval is also representative of the historic military uses of the larger former Military Camp. Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct and Mont St Quentin Oval was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct is part of the Ingleburn Defence Site, also formerly known as the Ingleburn Army Camp. The former itself is of considerable historic significance as the first Australian purpose built infantry training camp for the Second World War and as one of Australia's major Army camps for the period 1939-1970s. The Ingleburn Army Camp played a central role in the mobilisation of Australia's citizens, and in their military training, throughout the Second World War and was the assembly point for the first military contingent assembled for overseas service in the war. It is also significant for its role in the training of personnel for the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The site remained a major training base in New South Wales for general recruits and national servicemen for many years afterwards until the abolition of compulsory military training in 1973. The Army camp was a major centre in Australia for training under the National Service Scheme (1951-1972) and the guard house cells have historic associations with the anti conscription movement during the Vietnam War. The Army camp also played a major role in the training of Army Reserves from 1973 through to the 1990s. The guard house and cell block at Bardia Barracks date from the period of the Second World War and are historically associated with that conflict and also with the Vietnam War through associations with the introduction of conscription and, in particular, their use to house conscientious objectors. The memorials at the Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct have important historic associations through the commemoration of the military presence at the site and the endeavours of military personnel who trained at the site. The historic heritage values of the former Ingleburn Army Camp are embodied in the creation of the Military Heritage Precinct, including the following elements: * remaining P1 type hut barracks dating from 1939-1946; * entry gates and sentry boxes (symbolic of military presence and control at the site); * Mont St Quentin Oval; * the former Chaplains Office and Post Office * the guard house and cell block dating from the period of the Second World War; and * memorials The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Military Heritage Precinct now being the manifestation of the former Ingleburn Defence Site has an association with the lives and military experiences of generations of former service personnel. It has an important historic association with many military units which have given distinguished service in WWII such as the 16th Brigade of the 6th Division of the Second AIF, the first Australian unit to see armed conflict and the 2/13th Battalion variously known as the \\"devils own\\" or the \\"rats of Tobruk\\" for their determined fighting during the siege of Tobruk. It also has historic associations with units fighting in the Korean War and the Vietnam War as well as with other social trends during the Vietnam War such as the anti war lobby. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Ingleburn Defence Site has come to symbolise the service given by, and is of social significance to, generations of service personnel who passed through either en route to active service or for National Service training. It has social value to those who lived, and worked there, has a long association with a Statewide \\"Army community\\", and is a place where this sense of community is expressed, celebrated and passed on. It also serves to symbolise to the community the role of the Army within the area. The Bardia Barracks entrance precinct symbolises the entry to Army life, an event which was formative in the lives of many thousands of people who served at Ingleburn. The entry gates are associated with the establishment of military barracks on the site from 1939 and with Bardia Barracks in particular. The brick sentry boxes are symbolic of the military presence at the site. The site is significant as a place where respect for and remembrance of that service has become a continuing and highly valued tradition as evidenced by the creation of the Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct. In particular, the memorials at the Military Heritage Precinct embody this aspect of the place's significance. The memorials were identified as highly significant focal points for reflection and remembrance by past and present Army personnel who had served at Ingleburn, their families and the local community. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Ingleburn Military Heritage Precinct and Mont St Quentin Oval is representative of a typical command precinct for a large Army training defence site in NSW and Australia. The P1-type huts, guard house and cells are characteristic of military infrastructure and typical of Army training defence sites in Australia. Therefore, they are able to demonstrate the principal characteristics of their specific types. The Precinct and Oval are also representative of the historic uses of the former defence site.

Trading on the exchange stopped at 12:14pm and resumed at 3:25pm, with 35 minutes left of trading for the day. One week after the trading halt NASDAQ OMX credited the freeze to an overloading of the Securities Information Processor (SIP) caused by reconnection issues with the New York Stock Exchange Arca. The freeze received substantial media coverage and generated discussions on the security of increasingly technologically advanced stock exchanges. The event coined the term \\"flash freeze\\" following the earlier \\"flash crash\\" on May 6, 2010. Throughout the freeze the Nasdaq composite remained at 3631.17. Following the reopening of the market it rose, closing at 3,638.71, 1.1% higher. Shares of the Nasdaq exchange closed 3.42% down following the freeze.  Summary of events  A daily NASDAQ display. At 10:53am New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca could not connect to the SIP after multiple attempts. Subsequently Nasdaq declared ‚Äòself help‚Äô for Arca. This was revoked at 11:09am, suggesting that the issue with Arca had been resolved. At 12:14pm a technical issue impacted price quote distribution. This refers to be ability of the exchange to accurately provide prices of securities that are being traded. At 12:20pm, all trading was halted on the Nasdaq exchange. There was a subsequent trading halt placed on ‚ÄòTape C‚Äô stocks - Nasdaq listed stocks which may be traded on other exchanges, as quotes could not be provided for those securities. Unlike some purposeful trading halts, options trading did not continue during the flash freeze. In a statement, Nasdaq claimed that the initial cause of the outage was identified and resolved within 30 minutes and that the additional outage time was to ensure that there would be a stable reopening of the market. Test trades began at 2:45pm and trading officially resumed at 3:25pm. It was later reported that trades in ‚Äòdark pools‚Äô on Nasdaq listed securities continued in a limited manner past 12:14pm when trading was halted, until approximately 1:15pm. Multiple \\"dark pool\\" trading platforms were also shut down during the freeze, and some did not reopen until the follow day, such as Sigma X, a dark pool operated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Dark pools operated by other prominent banks and trading firms such as Wells Fargo and Citadel LLC were also non operational for periods of the freeze. These dark pools are not the jurisdiction of the Nasdaq or the NYSE but are reliant on accurate quotes being issued on stocks listed on either exchange and therefore cannot operate when Nasdaq stocks cannot be traded.  Cause  Prior to a public statement made by Nasdaq OMX released on the evening of August 22, there was speculation in financial markets as to the cause of the outage. Some media outlets suggested that the outage was caused by a coding error, while others speculated that hacking could have been the cause. The cause of the outage was identified as being a capacity issue with the Nasdaq SIP. A capacity assessment had been run on the SIP in January 2013 which found that each of the 50 ports in the system could tolerate 10,000 items per second, meaning the whole SIP had a capacity of 500,000 items per second. On August 22, 2013 the NYSE Arca system sent multiple sequences to Nasdaq which consumed a large amount of the system‚Äôs capacity. The SIP then received quote for inaccurate symbols, the few characters which are used to represent a security on an exchange, from NYSE Arca. This resulted in the SIP generating a numerous quote rejects which further absorbed capacity of the SIP. Every connect and disconnect sequence sent by NYSE Arca to the SIP resulted in over 26000 updates, per port per second. This enormously overwhelmed the Nasdaq SIP and resulted in a system shut down to ensure fairness in the market and prevent further overloading. Nasdaq stated that the volume of activity, per port, per second, at the time of the freeze, was 26 times that of a usual trading day.  NASDAQ Response  On August 22, 2013, NASDAQ OMX released a brief statement citing a connectivity issue between an exchange participant and the SIP as the catalyst for the inability to distribute quotes. The \\"exchange participant\\", later named as NYSE Arca was not specified in the initial statement. It was stated that the initial error was identified and resolved within 30 minutes and that the subsequent outage time was spent coordinating with regulators and stakeholders. On August 29, 2013, NASDAQ OMX issued a statement detailing the causes of the trading halt, as well as admitting a degree of responsibility for the outage. The statement accredited a number of convergent issues as the cause of the outage, some of which NASDAQ OMX took responsibility for. Of these issues they stated that ‚Äúwe are responsible for them, regret them, and intend to take all steps necessary to address them to enhance stability and functionality of the markets.‚Äù However, the statement also placed significant blame on the NYSE Arca system as the primary cause for the outage. The statement referred to systemic technological issues and called for collaboration among market leaders to progress the systems. The statement included references to policy changes and design improvements intended to mitigate the potential for further outages, specifically citing disaster recovery, as well as to improve communication with market participants when issues arise. The Chief Executive of NASDAQ at the time, Robert Greifeld, said in an interview with The New York Times that they did not blame Arca and the NYSE for the shutdown, instead suggesting that a broader issue with technology in the market was to blame, as well as stating that the Nasdaq too responsibility for the issues.  New York Stock Exchange response  The NYSE refuted Nasdaq‚Äôs claims that Arca was the primary cause of the outage. They took the position that Nasdaq was responsible for establishing and maintaining a system that could handle significant amounts of traffic and that a connectivity issue should not result in a closure of the entire exchange.  Industry response  Various responses were issued by US regulators and financial services firms during and after the freeze. Then Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mary Jo White issued a statement following the halt saying that the matter was serious and that it \\"should reinforce our collective commitment to addressing technological vulnerabilities of exchanges\\". She also stated that a meeting would be called between the leaders of the NYSE and Nasdaq exchange to encourage efforts to strengthen the markets. In the weeks following the freeze, the SEC called for both Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext to develop timelines of the freeze in order to identify the causes and areas for improvement. It was reported that the two platforms had conflicting reports of the causes and events. Nasdaq were also criticised for their lack of communication with traders and retail investors while the market was closed. Significantly, no message was sent by Nasdaq through the market feed to inform traders that the freeze had occurred. These messages are relied upon by automatic trading systems to ensure trades are not placed on markets which aren't operating, and resulted in manual shut down of trades in some firms. LandColt Capital Managing Director Todd Schoenberger was quoted as saying \\"The lack of transparency‚Äîwe haven't heard from the Nasdaq, we haven't heard from Washington‚Äîit creates chaos and uncertainty.‚Äù Harvey Pitt, a former chair of the SEC was quoted as saying \\"It looked like Nasdaq was clueless about how to deal with this emergency.\\" Media outlets reported that market participants were in communication with Nasdaq throughout the freeze, stating that there was an emphasis on ensuring the reopening of the market was without error, likely in an attempt to avoid a situation similar to the Facebook IPO. Many stakeholders believed that further issues at the reopening of the market would serve to damage investor confidence, and could lead to more substantial declines in the Nasdaq composite's value. Some finance industry commentators and participants suggested that the lack of severe market downturns following the freeze suggested that investors were becoming more understandable of the technical issues associated with increasingly automated trading platforms. Ryan Detrick, a strategist with Schaeffer's Investment Research said of the matter: \\"The fact we didn‚Äôt see a larger dip on today‚Äôs mess shows most investors are, for better or worse, becoming more comfortable with these mistakes.\\" However, other commentators highlighted the widespread uncertainty that technical glitches can contribute to. CEO of JonesTrading Group, William Jones was quoted as saying \\"This takes confidence from the markets,\\" as well as suggesting that traders were unsure if they could trust quotes published on various stocks, quoting his traders as asking \\"Are these prints real, or are they not real?\\".  Impact on financial markets  Unlike the flash crash of 2010, there were no significant losses in the market as a result of the trading halt. Media outlets suggested that the impact of the freeze was mitigated due to its timing, a Thursday afternoon in mid August, as well as by its relatively short time period. Michael Farr also credited the nature of the freeze, being caused by an error between exchanges, as assisting in preventing sell offs and negative impacts on other markets such as gold. A similar sentiment was expressed by Christopher Nagy, who is quoted by FOX News as saying \\"‚ÄúI think people realized it‚Äôs a technology issue rather than a major news event or something that would create panic and dysfunction.\\". However, the freeze raised further questions about the increasing risks posed by tech advances in the finance industry, contributing to potential dips in market confidence. Particularly, a number of media outlets considered the potential for targeted cyber attacks on significant trading platforms. It was pointed out by many that increased frequency of technical glitches in financial markets would decrease trader confidence, which could lead to dramatic market sell offs. While this was not the case for the August 2013 flash freeze, other technical glitches such as in September 2013, and again October 2013 can create trends. The structure of the industry was considered a contributing factor in the crash, given that miscommunication between NYSE and Nasdaq systems was the primary cause. Some journalists and financial commentators suggested that the freeze was evidence of the need for industry wide cooperation in developing emergency procedures to cope with the issues posed by high frequency trading. Democratic New York Senator Chuck Schumer was quoted as saying that the freeze was indicative of increasing computerisation of trading firms and exchange systems, calling for regulators to consider \\"fundamental market structure reforms.\\" It was reported that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) intended to develop a plan to further regulate computer based trading in the wake of the flash freeze, also spurred by the Goldman Sachs Group glitch that occurred the week prior. Brokerage firms that generate income through the execution of customer orders as well as proprietary trading firms were exposed to potential income loss during the freeze. Particularly given that many significant stocks such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon are listed on the Nasdaq, the shut down caused substantial interruptions to financial firms. It was suggested by some media outlets that the decision of Twitter to hold their initial public offering (IPO) on the NYSE was partially a result of the flash freeze. The issues with the Facebook IPO were also credited as a cause for this decision.

It concerned a challenge by the Western Australia Labor Party leader Jim McGinty of the 1996 election results on the basis of malapportionment. The plaintiffs sought to enshrine the principle of ‚Äòone vote one value‚Äô in the Australian Constitution, and has had a significant impact on how the High Court approaches matters of the franchise, as well as malapportionment. The plaintiff's submissions were unanimously rejected by the court, who found that the interpretation of sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution did not require that all votes hold the same value. The High Court exercised its original jursidiction in hearing the matter, and the case did not need to proceed from an appeal to the Western Australian  Background  = Western Australian elections = The Western Australian Legislature is made up of a bicameral parliamentary system, a legislative council and a legislative assembly, established in 1890. By 1996 the assembly had 57 members, which were divided between 34 metropolitan seats, clustered in Perth, and 23 rural electoral divisions. The Electoral Distribution Commission determined the borders and number of electors in each division, guided by the Electoral Districts Act 1947 (WA) as amended by the Acts Amendments (Electoral Reform) Act 1987 (WA), which required that each area contain an equal number of electors plus or minus 15 per cent.. Western Australia is the largest state in Australia, comprising 2,529,875 square kilometres (976,790 sq mi), and by 2014 73% of the population lived in the capital of Perth. At the time of the enactment of the 1987 amendments 669,293 voters were enrolled in the metropolitan and 240,081 in the remainder of the state. As a result, in the 1993 elections the largest district for state electors held 291% of the number of electors in the smallest electorate. This is the phenomenon known as malapportionment, where there are significant divergences in the number of electors in electorates, leading to an unequal value of each vote. This should be distinguished from gerrymandering, which is a partisan manipulation of the borders of electorates to ensure an outcome. The 1987 Amendments to the Electoral Districts Act 1947 (WA) also changed the way the legislative council, the state's upper house, was comprised. There were 34 available seats, which were distributed amongst six regions; \\"North Metropolitan Region (7 members), South Metropolitan Region (5 members), East Metropolitan Region (5 members), South West Region (7 members), Agricultural Region (5 members) and the Mining and Pastoral Region (5 members)\\". The populations of the regions for the 1993 election were; \\"North Metropolitan 34,161; South Metropolitan 33,876; East Metropolitan 32,822; South West 13,721; Agricultural 13,161; Mining and Pastoral 9,097\\". The disparities resulted in the North Metropolitan Region holding 376% of the population in the Mining and Pastoral Region, while only having two extra seats.  The arguments  The questions to be resolved in \\"(i) Is Section 6 of the Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899 (WA) invalid? (ii) Are Sections 2A(2), 6 and 9 of the Electoral Distribution Act 1947 (WA), or any of them, invalid? (iii) If any of the Sections 2A(2), 6 or 9 of the Electoral Distribution Act 1947 (WA) is or are invalid, is it or are they severable and, if so, to what extent?\\" The Plaintiffs argument rested on two primary grounds; Representative democracy requires, # That every person with capacity have the right to vote; and # That each vote should be equal in importance. The nature of this definition implies that there must be some restriction on voting, the determination of capacity is left to the legislature. The Plaintiffs argued that both the Commonwealth and Western Australian constitutions required that representative democracy be the starting point of any government structure in Australia. Brennan CJ noted that; \\"In this century, the age of legal adulthood has been reduced from 21 to 18 and the legal incapacity of women to vote has been removed. Aborigines, who were once constitutionally disqualified from the franchise, are no longer so disqualified. But age, sex and race are not the only qualifications that have governed an adult's right to vote. Other qualifications have related to ownership of property and education or a period of residence within the electoral district. Disqualifications still include the status of convicted criminal and mental infirmity or absence from registered address. In view of the fact that the franchise has historically expanded in scope, it is at least arguable that the qualifications of age, sex, race and property which limited the franchise in earlier times could not now be reimposed so as to deprive a citizen of the right to vote.\\" The High Court had already accepted the general proposition that the Commonwealth Constitution did not require a 'one man one vote' test in Attorney General; Ex Rel McKinlay v The Commonwealth (1975) 135 CLR 1.. Alternatively, Western Australia argued that prior precedent weighed to the view that the proper construction of both the Western Australian Constitution and the Commonwealth Constitution did not require an equality of voting power. Western Australia also advanced the argument that a disparity in voting power did not necessarily preclude fairness in elections, as relying on strict majoritarianism can result in bad outcomes for minorities.  Judgment  = The majority = Brennan CJ, Dawson, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ formed the majority view that the first two of the three questions outlined above were to be answered in the negative, and as a result it was unnecessary to address the third. The majority largely took the view that whilst the principle of representative government was contained within the Commonwealth Constitution and the Western Australian Constitution it did not necessitate an equality of voting power. The majority made reference to ss 7 and 24 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which provides that the Senate and House of Representatives respectively will be \\"directly chosen by the people\\".Constitution (Cth) The Senate, Constitution of House of Representatives. Gummow J found that whilst these sections read with the rest of the Constitution did give rise to a requirement for a representative government; \\"It does not follow from the prescription by the Constitution of a system of representative government that a voting system with a particular characteristic or operation is required by the Constitution. What is necessary is the broadly identified requirement of ultimate control by the people, exercised by representatives who are elected periodically\\". Further, the proposed restriction of malapportionment did not entirely reduce the problem, which was near impossible and, \\"One consideration in [the decision] was that the challenged electoral distribution laws respectively permitted a similar and lesser degree of malapportionment than legislation in 1978 permitted. Accepting the plaintiffs' argument would entail that the 1978 Parliament was not itself 'chosen directly by the people'. In essence, the Western Australian Constitution was interpreted according to its legislative and historical context, and the phrase 'chosen directly by the people' did not give rise to a strict equality of value in voting. Gaudron J subscribed to some similar reasoning to the dissent of Toohey J, including how the historical realities of the Western Australian electoral system evolved; \\"Ultimately, it is a question of what is required in the light of current democratic standards, including those which so recently applied in Western Australia.\\" = Dissent = Toohey J formed the sole dissent on the court. He considered that the words of the Commonwealth Constitution have varied over time, he noted that the High Court of Australia found that the connotation of the word jury had changed significantly over time in Cheatle v The Queen.. Toohey J considered that if the court considered that the meaning of 'representative' juries had changed over time this should carry over into the constitutional meaning of 'directly chosen by the people'. Whilst this reasoning was similar to Gaudron J, the difference of judgments was the result of an analysis of the causative factors in the denial of franchise; i.e. was malapportionment considered as sufficiently serious as the historical denial of suffrage to oppressed minorities. Toohey J considered that \\"The point is that, while the essence of representative democracy remains unchanged, the method of giving expression to the concept varies over time and according to changes in society.\\"  Consequences  The 5-1 result in favour of The State of Western Australia answered question (i) (Is section 6 of the Constitution Acts Amendment Act 1899 (WA) invalid?) in the negative. Question (ii) (Are Sections 2A(2), 6 and 9 of the Electoral Distribution Act 1947 (WA), or any of them, invalid?) was similarly rejected, and question (iii) (If any of the Sections 2A(2), 6 or 9 of the Electoral Distribution Act 1947 (WA) is or are invalid, is it or are they severable and, if so, to what extent?) was unnecessary to consider. By ruling against the case, the High Court set the precedent that the phrase \\"directly chosen by the people\\" in ss 7 and 24 of the Constitution could not be construed to incorporate a principle of one vote, one value. The court has thus far declined to consider any other state constitutional amendments, or state parliaments, that have entrenched malapportioned electoral districts in their electoral map. The role of malapportionment in Australian politics remains strong, and the impact on states such as Western Australia remains difficult to fully value. The lack of population densi McHugh J's judgment also extended a line of jurisprudence that had flowed from a series of cases in the 1980s and 1990s dealing with implied freedoms of political communication, that ‚Äòthe political and legal sovereignty of Australia now resides in the people of Australia‚Äô. (2017) 45(3) Federal Law Review 415 A distinction between the 'political' conception of sovereignty, and the legal definition, was a concept first elucidated by James Bryce in the early 20th century. The concept of the political, or popular, version of sovereignty could be defined as ‚Äòthe notion that the ultimate source of all authority exercised through the public institutions of the state originates in the people.\\" A consequence of this decision could be viewed as to what extent this judgment adopts the view that the sovereignty of the nation now resides in the Australian population and how that could impact on prior constitutional law. George Duke suggests that this judgment doesn't clear up entirely the position of the High Court and; \\"taken as a whole, the dicta of the High Court on popular sovereignty suggest a preference for a weak conception tied to elective parliamentary representation. The relevant High Court dicta on popular sovereignty are far from uniform\\". The basis of this argument is that the Australian Constitution has been popularly affirmed prior to enaction, and that following the termination of links with the United Kingdom via the Australia Acts the continuing effectiveness of the Constitution has been by the 'acquiescence of the people'. McGinty v Western Australia directly impacted this by adding definition to the words 'directly chosen by the people' and considering what impact the idea of representative democracy should have on subsequent constitutional interpretation. Gummow J's consdieration of the role of the population was also particularly interesting, he noted that the extent of the population's control over the Commonwealth Constitution was limited only to an affirmative or negative vote on a proposition, the actual substance of alteration is decided by the parliament. Even the people's control over the governance of the nation is only limited to the election of representatives who are periodically up for re-election.

Situated in North Street on the three-acre allotment of Suburban Lot 1, it stands immediately behind the site of the former Queen's Head Hotel. Suburban Lot 1 was registered to James Everett on 3 July 1860. History Everett, licensee of the Queen's Head Hotel, erected the cottage during the 1860s. It was built of brick on stone foundations, both of which are rendered. Wrought iron has since been used to replace the original roof covering. The cottage contains two rooms each with its own window. The front door enables direct access from the street. A kitchen area stands to the rear. Little significant change has been made to the cottage over the years, apart from two relatively small timber additions to the side and rear. The main structure, however, is still evident. It seems probable that Everett chose to live in this cottage while operating his business from the site of the Queen's Head Hotel. Everett lived alone due to the fact that his wife and all but one member of his family appear to have remained behind in England.

He distinguished five phases in its evolution: *firstly, pieces of valuable wood; *secondly, plain stone slabs; *thirdly, stones with an incised p≈´r·πáagha·π≠a (vessels of abundance) motif, subsequently rendered in low or high relief; *fourthly, stones where the carvings are replaced by figures of Bahirava or dwarfs, one on each stone, usually depicting ≈öa≈Ñkha and Padma, attendants of Kuvera (God of Wealth), or bh≈´tas (powerful protective ghosts/spirits); *final phase, which is the most common in the more important monastic buildings at Anuradhapura, features elaborately carved anthropomorphic nƒÅgarƒÅjas (snake gods), typical of the latter stages of the Anuradhapura period and the subsequent Polonnaruwa period. A close-up of the muragala, depicting the naga-raja. In one hand he holds a p≈´r·πáagha·π≠a and in the other a sprouting branch complete with leaves, buds and flowers. Around his head is a seven-hooded cobra hood. The two minor figures at his feet are ≈öa≈Ñkha and Padma. More recently archeologists consider that muragala merely served as a decorative feature, rather than a structural purpose. The earliest muragala date back to the early period of the Anuradhapura Kingdom (approximately 1st century A.D). Over time, the architects switched to the use of stone, as it was a more enduring material. The next stage in the evolution of the guard stones was the inclusion of carvings, however it has been difficult for archeologists to determine exactly when these changes began to take place. During the middle period (2nd century A.D. ‚Äì 6th century A.D.) and the latter period (7th century A.D. ‚Äì 11th century A.D.) of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, stone workers began to carve the image of a dwarves (≈öa≈Ñkha and Padma) on the muragala. It was during latter stages of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, that muragala with the images of NƒÅgarƒÅjas were carved. This however was not strictly a consecutive evolution but a succession of overlapping developments, with the most evolved p≈´r·πáagha·π≠a motifs not necessarily pre- dating the earliest NƒÅgarƒÅjas carvings.

They are often categorised in a sub-category of livestock known as micro-livestock, due to their small size. Rodents have been used as food in a wide range of cultures, including Hawaiian, Vietnamese, French, Indian and Thai. Rodent farming has been suggested as a solution to the world's increased requirements for food associated with an increasing population as a result of a number of perceived benefits with their production and consumption.  As food Rodents have been hunted and farmed in a number of cultures. The polynesian rat was hunted and consumed by the common people in pre-contact Hawaii. Capybaras, agoutis, and guinea pigs have historically been eaten in South America -- guinea pigs were farmed as far back in 2500 BCE in what is now Peru. Cane rats can grow up to 60 cm in length and weigh up to 10 kg and are hunted as bush meat in western and central Africa. Rats were commonly eaten during the Tang Dynasty in China; they may have been domesticated as they were called ‚Äúhousehold deer‚Äù. The Mishmi people in the Lohit district in India traditionally hunted rats. Dishes with rats captured in wine cellars are described in Larousse Gastronomique and rats are eaten in rural Thailand. Farming In the contemporary era, rodent farming has been suggested as a sustainable agriculture method to address current global malnutrition and to meet the needs of the world's growing population. Rodent farming can be economically efficient, since they can produce a large number of offspring per year, have a limited gestation period, and have a high feed conversion ratio. They require little space, so could be farmed in urban areas. Efforts have been made to develop rat farming among the dalit in the Indian state of Bihar; one obstacle to this is that the animal vehicle of the god Ganesh is a rat. In Cameroon, cane rats is encouraged in economic development efforts. In Australia, a rat farm that provides food for zoos and pet stores was the subject of a 2018 profile.  Management  Rodents can be kept in sheds or cages, and fed grain, pellets, or scraps. In nations with strict animal cruelty regulations, such as Australia, the animals must be killed humanely, for example by gassing with carbon dioxide. In nations without these regulations, it is more common for the animals to be killed by drowning or bludgeoning.

Throughout his life, Webber established himself as a prominent figure both in the Underground Railroad movement and in Cincinnati‚Äôs art scene. In Cincinnati in particular, Webber was held in high regard due to his artistic achievements.  Biography  = Early life = Charles T.

After this, Webber went on to open the Artists‚Äô Photographic and Picture Gallery with his partners, fellow artists Joseph Oriel Eaton and James Mullen. They sold portraits and photographs. Despite the business' success, the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 caused the business to dissolve. This prompted Webber to move into his own art studio, which was located at 14 East Fourth Street.

Through his involvement in many of Cincinnati's artistic groups and clubs, Webber was able to establish himself as an art educator. Through these ventures, he became a prominent and significant figure in Cincinnati's art scene. Wanting to continue his career as an art educator, Webber took up a teaching position at the Ohio Mechanics Institute School of Design in 1878. He taught a life class.\\"Discovering The Story  Underground Railroad\\". 2018. Discoveringthestory.Com. Accessed September 6. http://www.discoveringthestory.com/ugrr/background.asp#. = Later years = During the later years of his life, Webber found time to learn the art of sculpture. In 1896, he created a bust of H. Thane Miller, who was the director of the Cincinnati House of Refuge, out of bronze.Weidman, J., Haverstock, M., Vance, J. and Meggitt, B. (2000). Artists in Ohio, 1787-1900. Kent: The Kent State University Press, pp.917. In 1911, Webber died in his residence located in Riverside, Cincinnati, at the age of 85. He is buried in an unmarked grave which is located at Spring Grove Cemetery.  Contributions to the Underground Railroad  = Painting = Webber's most famous contribution to the Underground Railroad is his painting of the same name. Webber completed this painting in 1893 for the World's Columbian Exposition of that year. The painting depicts a group of fugitives who are being led to freedom by abolitionists. Those depicted in the painting are friends of Webber‚ÄîHannah Haddock, Levi Coffin, and his wife, Catharine Coffin. Levi Coffin was a prominent abolitionist and was widely known throughout the movement. The painting is of particular significance to the movement due to the fact that it focuses on the abolitionists who brought southern slaves to freedom in the northern states, rather than the slaves themselves or the persecutors they fled.  Contributions to the Artistic Scene in Cincinnati  The Cincinnati Academy of Fine Arts on October 18, 1838. Aiming to gain higher quality facilities for those in the artistic community, the Academy sponsored a number of exhibitions. Charles T. Webber sponsored a large loan exhibition of American and European art alongside various art collectors.Weidman, J., Haverstock, M., Vance, J. and Meggitt, B. (2000). Artists in Ohio, 1787-1900. Kent: The Kent State University Press, pp.982. Webber was also involved in Cincinnati's Sketch Club. He described the club's beginning as simple, with the club maintaining a profound sense of internal harmony until some wealthy merchants and preachers were included as honorary members. These members proved to bring about the group's eventual undoing, with the final meeting taking place on August 6, 1864, in Leon van Loo's studio.Weidman, J., Haverstock, M., Vance, J. and Meggitt, B. (2000). Artists in Ohio, 1787-1900. Kent: The Kent State University Press, pp.984. The Sketch Club is said to have had a major influence on the evolution of Cincinnati's artists and the artistic scene. In 1866, Charles T. Webber assisted in the formation of an organisation which was named Associated Artists of Cincinnati. The organisation was founded by a group of amateur and more experienced artists who had a vision to make Cincinnati ‚Äúthe Art-center of the Great West‚Äù.Weidman, J., Haverstock, M., Vance, J. and Meggitt, B. (2000). Artists in Ohio, 1787-1900. Kent: The Kent State University Press, pp.981. As well as this, the group aimed to start an art school to provide the citizens of Cincinnati with a more comprehensive understanding of art. Webber was elected President of the organisation. On December 22, 1866, the group's first Annual Exhibition and Conversazione took place. Held in William Wiswell Jr's gallery, the exhibition included works by Thomas D. Jones, William P. Noble, and Henry Mosler (among others). In 1868, Associated Artists was absorbed by the Cincinnati Academy of Fine Arts. By the 1890s, Charles T. Webber was considered Cincinnati's senior resident artist.\\"Discovering The Story  Underground Railroad\\". 2018. Discoveringthestory.Com. Accessed September 6. http://www.discoveringthestory.com/ugrr/background.asp#. Until his death in 1911, Webber remained an active member of the artistic community in Cincinnati. After his death, his artist friends wanted to purchase one of Webber's paintings, ‚ÄòThe Underground Railroad‚Äô, for the Cincinnati Art Museum. To do this, they started a subscription service to raise funds as a tribute to Webber.\\"Discovering The Story  Underground Railroad\\". 2018. Discoveringthestory.Com.

It was built from 1884 to 1893. It is also known as Chipping Norton Homestead. The property is owned by the Chipping Norton Lakes Authority. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Situated near the Georges River north of Moorebank, Chipping Norton was a farming area throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. It was named after an old English village by William Alexander Long, who was born in Sydney in 1839, went to England to study law, and later lived in Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire. He bought up a number of former land grants in the area at the turn of the century and called his homestead Chipping Norton. The horse stud on part of his property produced many fine young horses. He died in 1915 and the Government of New South Wales bought his estate and subdivided it into farming blocks for soldiers returning from World War I.Pollen, 1996, 61 The Homestead was built on land that, prior to European settlement, was largely characterised by open eucalypt forest with swamp areas along the river. There are no identified sites of Aboriginal occupation within The Homestead and its near environs. The earliest Europeans to visit the area of modern day Chipping Norton were George Bass and Matthew Flinders, followed by Governor Hunter in 1797. Land grants were made in the area from the late 1790s. The earliest alienation of The Homestead site for European occupation in the late eighteenth century is poorly documented. One of the first settlers in the area was George Johnston of the New South Wales Corps who received a substantial land grant at the junction of the Georges River and Prospect Creek. Johnston's homestead, George's Hall, was built on a rise overlooking the river. Owing to flooding, a second house was built on the property in the 1830s. Both houses are still extant on the opposite side of the river from The Homestead. Johnston also held land in the area of The Homestead (90 acres). Johnston owned several major properties, including his main property at Annandale, and other holdings at Bankstown, Cabramatta and Lake Illawarra. Adjoining Johnston's land south of the Georges River, was 85 acres granted to Thomas Rowley, another officer of the NSW Corps, in 1798. Rowley also held land at Bankstown, Petersham, and Liberty Plains (Concord) which was probably his principal residence. Rowley died of consumption in 1806. On the basis of what is known of Johnston's and Rowley's activities as well as the more general pattern of documented occupation in this period it is unlikely that substantial dwellings were erected on either property. The earliest use of the site, after both grants were cleared, probably was for pasturage and/or agricultural development, grain or hay crops. It is possible that some small huts used by convict workers managing these activities were erected on the properties. There is little or no direct evidence for the use of the specific site of the later area of The Homestead, although the position of the Homestead on a rise above the river makes it a likely potential occupation site in earlier periods. Rowley's grant passed to Robert Campbell junior by 1822. In 1837 the land was purchased by Samuel Bowler. The use of the site from the 1830s to the 1870s is unknown. It is possible that the land remaining in the Johnston family possession continued to be used in the same manner. Samuel Bowler kept the land for nearly thirty years. This length of time suggests that Bowler was using the property, probably as a farm. In 1865 Bowler sold the former Rowley grant to David Johnston, thus consolidating the two grants at the bend of the Georges River within one family ownership. The Johnston family of The Homestead, Georges Hall retained the land until 1883 when they sold the former Rowley grant to Alfred Smart, who had also acquired the adjoining Johnston grant. Smart sold both properties to William Long in 1884. The 1890s recession severely affected Long who was forced to mortgage the entire estate by 1899. The history of the property is then traced following a succession of owners in the early twentieth century to the time when it was associated with the Soldier Settlement Area and subdivided into a series of small farms. At this time block containing The Homestead also had a cottage/office, Bulk Stable with stalls and bails, Coach house and stables, as well as a number of sheds and windmills. The Homestead was requisitioned for wartime occupation by the military in 1942-43, and became the home of the Fairall family during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1975 The National Trust of Australia (NSW) classified the property for its cultural heritage values. In 1978, The Homestead was acquired by the NSW Department of Environment and Planning as part of a larger acquisition for the purposes of implementing the Chipping Norton Lakes Scheme. The group was refurbished prior to 1992 with buildings repaired/restored, the landscape \\"tidied up\\" and a picket fence erected along the front (northern) boundary. A wishing well \\"superstructure\\", constructed of timber with a shingled gable roof and a timber windlass, recorded over the brick cistern in 1992 has been removed. The Homestead was leased as a restaurant and entertainment facility in the early 1990s. The place was added to the surrounding reserve for public recreation in April 1992, when Liverpool City Council as Trust manager for the Reserve became the lessor of the Lease. The lease expired in 1998, at which time Liverpool City Council was reported to be investigating appropriate future uses for The Homestead. The building remains vacant in 2018.Rod Howard & Associates, et al., 2004  Description  The Homestead Group consists of: # A late Victorian Italianate style residence of rendered brickwork with attached rear service/accommodation wings, # A pair of more recent outbuildings, # Remnant planting from earlier landscaping, # A small timber garden shed and # The site of the former timber stables. The group is located on level land overlooking the sand mining activities of Lake Moore. The site landscaping comprises areas of grassed lawn scattered in an informal manner with a number of large trees and more recent shrubs and young trees. Early components which remain include pine trees, an olive grove and a number of large peppercorn trees. Interspersed with these, however, are some inappropriate plantings including melaleucas.LEP, 1995 =Homestead= The Homestead is a single storey Victorian Italianate residence of stuccoed brickwork with a hipped slate roof and rendered brickwork chimneys. A verandah surrounds two sides of the building, its slightly curved corrugated iron clad roof supported on circular cast iron columns and decorated with cast iron cornered brackets. On the front elevation the verandah abuts a hipped roofed wing and projecting 3 sided bay window. Italianate renderwork decoration includes brackets and raised panels under the eaves and mouldings around the round headed windows. The verandah floor is paved with tessellated tiles and edged with sandstone. The front door has fielded panels with stained glass leadlights above and in the fanlight and side light. There are five main rooms, each with fireplace surrounds, mostly marble. The door and window joinery and architraves and skirtings were reported as generally intact and in good repair in 1992. Some original plaster ceilings and cornices survived. Others were replaced with pressed metal. Towards the rear of the house is a large room lit by rooflights and paved with tessellated tiles.1992 Heritage Study =Grounds= The Homestead Group consists of a number of archaeological and early landscape features. The vegetation is a mixture of native and introduced trees, shrubs and grass species. Tree and shrub species include camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), gums (Eucalyptus spp.), silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), pencil cedar (Juniperus virginiana), oleander (Nerium oleander), African olives (Olea europaea var.africana), Monterey pines (Pinus radiata), Cape honeysuckle/tecoma (Tecomaria capensis and coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens).(1981 existing landscape plan, in Thorp, 1985) Two camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), one growing very near to the original kitchen/laundry wing on the south-eastern side of The Homestead, are over 100 years old. There were originally three old camphor laurels close to the house and four overall; however, two were cut down in 2011 as their roots were threatening the integrity of the building's foundations. Other trees nearby include a group of tall fan palms (Washingtonia robusta) and Monterey pines further away (Pinus radiata). Underplantings under the camphor laurels close to The Homestead include ladder ferns (Nephrolepsis sp), Kaffir lilies (Clivia miniata), a tree fern (Cyathea sp.), spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum) and Philodendron villosum. Areas of concrete paving are close to the original kitchen/laundry wing. The present garden area surrounding the large residence contains a number of archaeological elements. On the north and south side of the house are several features that relate to the former garden layout. This includes an old driveway formation evident in the grass and remnants of former bitumen and concrete paths and garden edges. To the east of the house the remains of a concrete fountain structure are evident, it is now covered by a large wooden cover. To the rear (south) of the building is a circular cistern constructed of brick. The cistern has diameter of 2.6m and is 4m deep. Outside the northern boundary of the group is a concrete horse trough that measures 3.2m x 0.85m. The grounds of the group also contain the archaeological site of the former late 19th century timber stables and coach house. Located south of the rear of the main house the site is marked by a wooden interpretative sign. Foundations of this structure still remain. The foundations are rectangular and displayed within them are a number of old agricultural tools. The signage, which is badly weathered and partly illegible, reads: > \\"This is the site of the former stables and coach house (north wing) which > was erected in 1887 by WA Long the original owner of the Homestead.

Her mother, Rachel, is a local registered nurse and her father, Mike, is a police lieutenant. Hill attended public schools in the Santa Clarita Valley and graduated from Saugus High School in 2004. Hill attended California State University, Northridge where she earned a bachelor's degree in English and a Master of Public Administration. Earlier career Hill began her career as a policy advocate at People Assisting the Homeless (PATH), a non-profit organization developing affordable and supportive services for the homeless in California. Her husband allegedly worked there as well and it is claimed Hill was his boss. Later as the Executive Director for PATH, she raised the organization from a local force in Los Angeles County to one of the largest non-profit providers of homes for the homeless in California. Hill helped pass a ballot initiative, Measure H, during spring of 2017 to help alleviate homelessness by providing $1.2 billion in funds for homeless services in Los Angeles County.Holt, Jim (February 23, 2017). \\"Debate weighs pros and cons of Measure H\\" The Signal.Pramuk, Jacob (April 4, 2018). \\"The number of women running for office is rising. 7 first-time House candidates explain why they're running in the age of Trump\\" CNBC.

Hill denied allegations of a relationship with Kelly, saying that her estranged husband, whom she described as \\"abusive\\", was doing everything he could to humiliate her, and that her political opponents were exploiting a private matter for political gain. Her husband denied the allegations of abuse and Hill's subsequent marriage dissolution petition did not allege abuse nor wrongdoing. Hill reached out to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi to deny the allegations. RedState also published nude photos of Hill as part of the story. Hill said that the U.S. Capitol Police opened an investigation into who may have leaked the photos. The House Ethics Committee announced on October 23, 2019, that it would conduct an investigation into the allegation that Hill had an affair with a male staffer, which, if true, would be in violation of House ethics reforms that were implemented in 2018 in response to the #MeToo movement. On that same day, Hill sent an email to constituents in which she admitted to an \\"inappropriate relationship\\" with a campaign staffer before becoming a representative (hence out of scope of the Congressional investigation) and promised to cooperate with the Congressional ethics investigation regarding allegations of wrongdoing as a member of Congress. The earlier relationship Hill admitted to was with a 22-year-old female subordinate recently out of college. On October 27, Hill announced via Twitter that she would resign from Congress. She wrote, \\"This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents and our country.\\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Hill made \\"some errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable.\\" Hill has vowed to combat revenge porn after photos of her were leaked. In her last speech before Congress on October 31, 2019, Hill said there was a \\"double standard\\" and \\"misogynistic culture\\" that resulted in her decision to step down from her position when faced with allegations of an improper relationship with a staff person. In the address to Congress she said, \\"I'm leaving, but we have men who have been credibly accused of intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the Supreme Court, in this very body, and worst of all, in the Oval Office.\\" She closed by saying, \\"as my final act I voted to move forward with the impeachment of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America.\\" On December 7, 2019, Hill penned an op-ed in The New York Times in which she described the events that led to her decision to resign, and mentions that she was suicidal during that time period. In the special election held in the spring of 2020, Hill endorsed her longtime friend, State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who ultimately lost the election. Hill, whose PAC contributed $200,000, said that Smith had been considered \\"the mom of Democratic politics\\" in the district for years, and that \\"there's no one else that I could even think of that I would want to run for this.\\" Some Democrats regretted Hill's involvement in the campaign. After Hill's resignation, Monica Lewinsky reached out and offered to talk about some of the similarities and differences in being the victim of public shaming. Lewinsky's ability to heal over the years was powerful to Hill. Electoral history  Personal life  Hill came out as bisexual after high school. She was California's first openly bisexual person to be elected to Congress. In July 2010, Hill married Kenny Heslep, an artist. They resided in Agua Dulce, California, on their farm, where they fostered rescue animals. By July 2019, Hill was in a romantic relationship with Alex Thomas, a political reporter. Hill also rented an apartment in Washington, D.C., with freshman representative Lauren Underwood. Heslep filed for divorce in 2019. In August 2020, Hill released a book, She Will Rise: Becoming a Warrior in the Battle for True Equality, in which she shares her experiences from her time in politics.

It was built from 1818 to 1824. The property is owned by the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The first land grants in the area were made between 1807 and the early 1820s when the area was opened up under Governor Macquarie in his push for new land heading west and south west from Sydney. The land comprising the property which became known as Cecil Hills was the result of the amalgamation of grants to Joseph Sherrard, Simeon Lord, Thomas Wylde and John Wylde. The grant of John Wylde fronted the Cowpasture Road that linked Prospect to Camden (today's Camden Valley Way) and is approximately 8 km west of Liverpool. John Wylde had arrived in the colony with his father Thomas Wylde (and other family members) in 1816. The family settled in Sydney with Wylde taking up his position as Judge Advocate to the Colony, a position to which he had been appointed while in England. John Truro Wylde was born in 1781 the eldest son of Thomas Wylde. He was ambitious and actively sought a posting to the colonies. Wylde was offered a post in New South Wales which he initially declined on grounds of financial hardship. After offers of financial assistance and relocation costs from the Government of New South Wales he accepted the posting and moved with his brother-in-law to the colony. John received his grant in 1817 and named his property Cecil Hills after his home Cecil Lodge, at Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. John Wylde, who was living at O'Connell Street in the City, took up his grant and by July 1818 had contracted to supply 6,000 lbs of meat to the Government stores. This made him the largest recorded supplier of meat at the time. By 1820 Commissioner Bigge noted that Simeon Lord with 4,165 acres and John Wylde with 1,479 were the largest land holders in Sydney. The Wylde family did not live on the property until, at the earliest, July 1824 when he gave notice of leaving his official residence and advertised the disposal of all the household effects from that residence. It is most likely that the homestead at Cecil Hills was constructed prior to Wylde's moving in. The property had been producing substantial quantities of beef from as early as 1818 indicating that it was well established and had a substantial number of staff to operate the farm activities. By 1828 John had left the Colony and the property was occupied by his wife Elizabeth. There is no indication of how staff were accommodated and there are no remains of structures on the site dating from that period apart from the house.Cserhalmi & Partners, 1996 Convicted London joiner and carpenter James Gough (1790-1876) who arrived on the Earl Spencer in 1813 got the private commission to built John Wylde's Cecil Hills farmhouse. Thomas Wylde sold his city residence in July 1820 and may have moved to Cecil Hills. He died in December 1821 and his property passed to John. In 1831 Sherard sold his adjoining 100 acres to John and Edward Wylde, bringing the property to a total of 3,589 acres. Wylde retained his properties in NSW until his death in 1859 when they passed to his wife who remained in residence until her death in 1864. They were leased that year and again in 1874. Between 1870 and 1890 various powers of attorney were granted over the property until finally in 1890 the Perpetual Trustee Company took over trusteeship and disposed of it in 1892. The property was divided into several parcels, many of which have now been resumed for roads and electricity lines. A parcel of 1,878 acres containing the main homestead, changed hands several times and was finally sold to Charles Ward Pye who transferred the property to his sons Henry and Richard. There were further road resumptions in 1943 and 1953 and then in 1965 for a main electricity line across the property. On 23 October 1963 the registered owner of the property became Cecil Hills Pty Ltd. In 1972 the Government compulsorily purchased the property from the Pye family and it has remained in government ownership since that time. The Pye family had operated the property as a beef and sheep farm run by a manager on the site, but did not at any stage live on the holding. The buildings underwent extensive conservation works in the early 1990s. At the time of its heritage listing in 1999, it was operating as a day program for post-school intellectually disabled people run by The Junction Works Inc.; however, this has no longer operates at the site. The former farmland associated with the house is being developed by Mirvac as the 1000-home Elizabeth Hills estate.  Description  The Cecil Hills Farm Group comprises a complex of rural farm buildings of various dates from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. The complex includes a main homestead and a wide range of outbuildings (most of which have been modified) and other ancillary works/structures. All of the buildings are set in a relatively unspoilt, largely rural landscape. The Cecil Hills Farm Group includes: # Main Homestead: a single storey brick nog construction building with hipped iron roof ( 1820s); # Rear garage: (possibly the former kitchen block; # Stables; # Former cow bails; # Shearing shed; # Other works/structures associated with farming activities (stockyards, sheep dip, gallows); # Former sites of buildings and structures; # Other outbuildings including a small iron privy and a pair of corrugated iron sheds. Mature plantings around the house include coral trees (Erythrina sp., probably E.x sykesii), Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) and kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus). Other plantings include cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), likely a former hedge species on site. The complex also contains a recent corrugated iron and steel shed ( 1960s) which is not significant and a fibro outhouse. There may still be some archaeological potential associated with the site's former use, but it is presumed that potential will be limited due to the extensive conservation. The Cecil Hills Groups is substantially intact and has retained a high degree of integrity, particularly the main homestead.  Heritage listing  The Cecil Hills Farm Group is one of the earliest surviving farm complexes in the Liverpool district and has operated as a working farm for over 170 years. The main farmhouse is a rare and unusual example of brick nog construction, retaining much of its earlier detailing. The farm group, although not all dating from the earliest period, is a good example of a large early farm complex with elements spanning the period from 1820 to the present. The farm buildings give context to the house and surrounds allowing a high level of understanding and interpretation of the use of the property. The property was granted to, occupied and farmed by Sir John Wylde, Judge Advocate to Governors Brisbane and Macquarie. He was a significant figure in colonial history, associated with the founding of the Bank of New South Wales and the Australian judicial system. Cecil Hills Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Cecil Hills Farm has historical significance as one of the earliest farms in the Liverpool district. The site has further significance for its association with John Wylde, the Judge Advocate to Colony as one of the first (and largest) suppliers of beef to the colony. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Cecil Hills Farm has aesthetic significance as a rare surviving early farm group retaining elements of its original rural setting. The farm buildings give context to the house and surrounds that allow a high level of understanding and interpretation of the use of the property, allowing rare insights into an early working farm. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Cecil Hills Farm has social significance as the former property and then residence of John Wylde and his family. It has further significance for its contribution to the survival of the colony of NSW through beef and mutton production. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cecil Hills Farm has technical/research significance on a number of levels. Firstly for its demonstration of early colonial building techniques, particularly the now extinct technique of brick nogging. Secondly for its demonstration of colonial farming practices. Thirdly for its demonstration of the evolution of farming practices in NSW from the earliest days of the colony through to the mid twentieth century. Cecil Hills Farms provides a rare insight into the evolution of a working farm over a long period of time. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cecil Hills Farm is an extremely rare grouping of substantially intact farm buildings dating from the 1820s through to the early 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Cecil Hills Farm is a rare representative example of a substantially intact Colonial farm group associated with the early days of feeding the Colony.

Early life  Luisito Rey was the son of Rafael Gallego Rey, a flamenco singer turned electrician, and Matilde S√°nchez Repiso, a singer and dancer. His siblings are Vicente, nicknamed Tito, and Mario. From an early age he had a penchant for singing, composing and playing the guitar. His natural talent helped him to get out of Spain and travel through many countries, including Argentina, where he met his life companion, Italian model Marcela Basteri. His artistic name was originally Luisito Gas√°n (combining the first syllables of his father's and mother's last name). He later settled for Luisito Rey, Luisito being the diminutive of Luis and Rey being his father's maternal surname. A bullfighter fan, his favorite toreador was Luis Miguel Gonz√°lez Lucas, better known as Luis Miguel Domingu√≠n, father of famous singer Miguel Bos√©. In his honor, he named his firstborn son Luis Miguel Gallego. His first taste of success was with the song \\"Frente a una copa de vino\\" (In front of a glass of wine), a ballad classic that became his biggest and only major hit in Latin America. Nevertheless, he wasn't a one-hit wonder, as he had other hit songs, including La Gran Ciudad (The great city) and El Loco (The Crazy Man).  Reputation  Luisito Rey's reputation as a solid artist and able manager was greatly tarnished with the revelations of many of his acquaintances. Some, like Luis Miguel's godfather, renowned Puerto Rican psychologist Alfred D. Herger, have described him as a psychopath and abuser. Years earlier, Rey's brother Vicente stated that Rey would sometimes prostitute Luis Miguel's mother Marcela Basteri for drug binges. Dominican- born Mexican actor and family friend Andr√©s Garc√≠a revealed that Rey had taken advantage of him by asking to stay in an apartment which Garc√≠a was paying for a female friend. Despite constant promises, Rey never reimbursed any of the rent to Garc√≠a. Keeping with custom, Luis Miguel has said nothing publicly about his relationship with his father. Rey once stated that Pablo Picasso painted a small sketch of him, used in one of his greatest hits albums, and that singer Frank Sinatra was interested in recording La Gran Ciudad. None of these events were actually true.

In the 1960s, Deschryver and Dian Fossey gained much prominence in their approach of two subspecies of gorillas in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The former had started approaching gorillas during the mid-1960s for tourism, accompanied by two trackers of the Pygmy tribe, Pili Pili Purusi and Mishebere Patrice. Today, Deschryver might be best recognized from a sequence out of the 1974 documentary Gorilla, which shows him bringing an abandoned baby gorilla into the forest to help it adjust to its natural habitat. The baby gorilla begins to scream when it hears other gorillas and is subsequently snatched from Deschryver by the dominant silverback. The silverback attempts to either attack or intimidate Deschryver, but ultimately backs away when Deschryver refuses to move or flinch.

From the initial 100 students, the program provided education in the United States to around 500 students. They would go on to be influential members of the Philippine society, with many of the alumni of the program going on to work for the government in the Philippine Islands. Due to their success, other immigrants from the Philippines followed to be educated in the United States, in excess of 14,000. Many of these non-pensioned students ended up permanently residing in the United States. In 1943, the program ended. It was the largest American scholarship program until the Fulbright Program was established in 1948. During World War II, Japan initiated a similar program during its occupation of the Philippines, named nampo tokubetsu ryugakusei. Following the War, and Philippine independence, Filipino students continued to come to the United States utilizing government scholarships. Background During the Spanish era of the Philippines, officially from the years 1565 to 1898, education other than that provided by religious institutions, was not generally available to the average Filipino until after 1863. Following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, the Philippines was annexed by the United States due to the Treaty of Paris, and it became a territory of the United States. As a consequence, Filipinos became nationals of the United States. Alt URL However, Filipinos who supported the independence of the First Republic of the Philippines clashed with American authority, and fought an unsuccessful conflict with the United States. At the behest of American soldiers, well-to-do families began to send their children to the United States for education; one example was Ramon Jose Lascon, who went on to earn his Ph.D. at Georgetown University at the age of 20. This followed a trend of well-to-do Asian families sending students to the United States, with Chinese students first coming to the United States beginning in 1847, and Japanese students coming to the United States beginning in 1866. The first school established by the United States in the Philippines was on Corregidor. Following the establishment of the Philippine Commission, it began to pass legislation to provide for public education, primarily Act Number 74 in 1901, which established public schools. In 1902, Act Number 372 established public secondary education in each provincial capital. However, there was a lack of educators, with many soldiers taking up the task of becoming teachers. In an attempt to increase the number of educators in the Philippines, over 500 teachers from the United States were sent there aboard the USAT Thomas, arriving in 1901; these teachers would later be known as Thomasites. These teachers from the United States were also tasked to train Filipinos to become teachers; however, schools continued to have a shortage of educators. Passage Then-Governor General William Howard Taft asked for more to be done to foster goodwill between Filipinos and Americans. In 26 August 1903, Act 854 of the Philippine Commission‚Äîthe Pensionado Act‚Äîwas passed. It was then passed by the United States Congress. Initially envisioned by Professor Bernard Moses in July 1900, the program was to pacify Filipino opposition following the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, as well as prepare the islands for self-governance, by showing the difference between Spain and the United States through exposure to American values. Additionally, the program was to expose the United States to \\"the best and brightest Filipino youths\\" to \\"make a favorable impression\\" of the Philippines in the United States. Implementation St. Louis Exposition The program was initially overseen by David Prescott Barrows, the Philippines' director of education at the time. In its first year, 1903, there were twenty thousand applicants, of which about a hundred were selected. Those selected became the first pensionados, students who were accepted by this scholarship program. These early pensionados were chosen from the wealthy and elite class of Filipinos. Prior to taking college courses, the initial pensionados attended high school in the continental United States for the purpose of language and culture acclimation. In some areas of the United States, the pensionados were some of the first Filipinos to immigrate to those areas; as was the case for Chicago, New York City, Riverside, San Diego, and Ventura County, California. As much as a quarter of the initial batch of pensionados went to school in the Chicago region. During the second year of the program, the first Pinay (Filipino women) pensionados were chosen, numbering five out of a total of thirty-nine; this created a gender imbalance favoring Pinoy (Filipino men) pensionados. In 1904, pensionados served as guides and waiters at the Philippines exhibit at the St. Louis Exposition; there they were a contrast to the Igorots, who also represented Filipinos to the attendees of the world's fair. In 1905, only three Pinay pensionados were chosen out of a total of thirty- seven pensionados beginning the program. As the program continued, the number of pensionados steadily increased, with there being 180 pensionados in 1907, and 209 in 1912. Among the pensionados were some of the first Filipino nursing students to come to the United States. Only seven years after the program began, the initial 100 pensionados had all returned to the Philippines. Beginning in 1908, with the opening of the University of the Philippines, the program shifted its focus from undergraduate studies to graduate studies. There was a pause in the program between 1915 and 1917. In 1921, the Philippine government was supporting 111 pensionados, 13 of whom were working towards a doctoral degree. From 1903 until 1938, pensionados traveled to the United States to study, with the majority returning to the Philippines. In 1943, the program ended. Pensionados would go on to serve within the government established in the islands by the United States; this was a scholarship requirement, and had to be at least 18 months of government service. Before returning to the Philippines, pensionados began student-run newspapers, which were part of the beginning of media geared specifically to the Filipino diaspora in the United States. While, initially, pensionados were chosen from wealthy and elite families, later pensionados were more likely not to come from wealthy families. Due to the Great Depression funding for the program was reduced. For instance, in 1930, there were but thirteen pensionados, eleven of whom were funded fully by the Philippine government, two of whom were partially funded, and another six were formerly funded by the Philippine government but remained in the United States to complete their education at their own expense. Near the end of World War II, the Commonwealth Government in Exile was offered to have some of the pensionados trained in foreign relations, anticipating the 1946 independence of the Philippines from the United States. =Schools attended= Pensionados went on to attend many colleges and universities, including the following: *California Christian College *Columbia University *Cornell University *Drexel Institute *Harvard University *Indiana University *Los Angeles Junior College *Massachusetts Institute of Technology *Oberlin College *San Diego Normal School *Stanford University *Syracuse University *State Normal School *University of California **University of California, Los Angeles *University of Chicago *University of Illinois *University of Michigan *University of Southern California *University of Washington *Woodbury College Impact Upon returning to the Philippines, pensionados were often called \\"American boys\\" and faced discrimination from other Filipinos. This discrimination was due to the view that the returning pensionados were associated with American authority of the Philippines. Some of the later Filipino immigrants to the United States, who were not the children of the well-to-do in the Philippines like the pensionados were, shared this resentment. Carlos Bulosan, an English- language Filipino novelist and poet, wrote of this social divide. Some of the returning pensionados would go on to help the development of Filipino nationalism. Carlos P. Romulo, a pensionado alum, soldier, and diplomat. A majority of the returning pensionados were assigned as educators, with some later becoming superintendents. For instance, University of Michigan alum Esteba Adaba became the director of education for the Philippines under the Roxas Administration; he would then go on to become a Philippine senator. Jorge Bocobo, an Indiana University alum, went on to become President of the University of the Philippines. Returning pensionados who studied nursing established nursing schools, whose students would go on to immigrate around the world to fill nursing shortages. Pensionado Bienvenido Santos made his name as an author. Other pensionados took influential roles in government, including Secretary of Finance Antonio de las Alas, Senator Camilo Osias, Major General Carlos P. Romulo, and Chief Justice Jos√© Abad Santos. When architects began to be registered in the Philippines in 1921, a pensionado was the second to be registered. Ultimately, about 500 pensionados received scholarships to be educated in the United States. =Other students= The success of returning pensionados enticed others to immigrate to the United States, including non-pensionados who self- financed their higher education, including some veterans of the United States Navy. By the 1920s, these self-financed students outnumbered the pensionados. The aspiration of education advancement became a dominant theme for those Filipinos coming to the United States. Known as \\"fountain pen boys\\", by 1920 nearly five thousand Filipino students had attended American schools, receiving post-secondary education. In 1922 alone, there were almost 900 Filipinos attending college in the United States. So many Filipinos would seek to advance their education that by 1930, they were the third largest population of students from outside of the continental United States, only surpassed by Chinese and Canadian students; some of those Chinese students were attending using a similar government funding method known as the Boxer Indemnity. By 1938, around 14,000 Filipino students had received their education in the United States, some going onto important positions upon returning to the Philippines. Some of these students would go on to fund their education as domestic workers, with some attending Chapman College and the University of Southern California, with a few earning graduate degrees. Others attempted to fund their education by working as farmworkers; one immigrant to do so was Philip Vera Cruz. Many of these self-funding students would not return to the Philippines, instead settling in the United States. E. Llamas Rosario, for example, earned graduate degrees from Columbia University and New York University and went on to found the Filipino Pioneer, a newspaper published in Stockton, California. Along with those who immigrated to the United States without educational aspirations, these Filipinos started the second wave of immigration to the United States from the Philippines. Educated Filipinos who settled in the United States faced racial discrimination when looking for jobs in their trained industries. In addition, laws barred Filipinos from professional employment, such as the ones in California which barred non-citizens the ability to gain professional licenses. =Similar programs= In 1909, due to an overpayment by China to the United States of funds for damages caused during the Boxer Rebellion, the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship was established. It has its roots in an idea proposed by Edmund James, then the Chancellor of the University of Illinois. Subsequent payments made by China to the United States relating to the Boxer Rebellion were deferred, as long as they were spent for the scholarship. A school, Qinghua Preparatory School which was jointly operated by China and the United States, was opened to train students who would be traveling to the United States. This scholarship lasted until 1937; about 2,000 Chinese students were funded by the scholarship. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the Japanese government sponsored students to study in Japan, with two groups being sent Japan in 1943 and 1944. The program was administrated out of the former American School in Japan by a part of the Ministry of Greater East Asia. Prior to departing for Japan, the students were disciplined by the Second Republic Constabulary to cleanse their thinking of anti-Japanese sentiments; this was conducted at Malaca√±ang, but only after the students had passed individual interviews with a panel of Japanese officials which included General Wachi. In total there were a total of 51 students who studied in Japan under the program, referred to as \\"Nantoku\\" „Éä„É≥„Éà„ÇØ. In 1946, after the Philippines became an independent nation, thousands more Filipinos came to the United States for education through the Fulbright Program. The Fulbright exchanges have since become a larger program than the pensionado program. A similar but smaller program funding the education of Filipinos in the United States was done under the Smith‚ÄìMundt Act, which was specific for civic leaders. =Inspired legislation= In the early 21st century, legislators have introduced bills named after the Pensionado Act in the Senate of the Philippines. In 2010, Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago submitted the \\"Pensionado Act of 2010\\", which remained in committee. In 2017, Senator Sonny Angara submitted \\"Pensionado Act of 2017\\" which was referred to committee of the Philippine Senate in the 17th Congress, with no additional action taken; following the conclusion of the 17th Congress, Senator Angara submitted similar legislation titled \\"Pensionado Act of 2019\\" to the current Philippine Senate.

It was developed by Professor Deepak Pental from the University of Delhi, with the aim of reducing India's demand for edible oil imports. DMH - 11 was created through transgenic technology, primarily involving the Bar, Barnase and Barstar gene system. The Barnase gene confers male sterility, while the Barstar gene restores DMH - 11's ability to produce fertile seeds. The insertion of the third gene Bar, enables DMH - 11 to produce phosphinothricin-N- acetyl-transferase, the enzyme responsible for Glufosinate resistance. This hybrid mustard variety has come under intense public scrutiny, mainly due to concerns regarding DMH - 11's potential to adversely affect the environment as well as consumer health. DMH - 11 was found not to pose any food allergy risks, and has demonstrated increased yields over existing mustard varieties. Conflicting details and results regarding the field trials and safety evaluations conducted on DMH - 11 have delayed its approval for commercial cropping. History Mustard is an oil seed crop which currently occupies of agricultural land, predominantly in the North- western dry land regions of India. Mustard is among the three highest produced oil seed crops in India. However, its yields have not experienced any significant increase for several years, and has remained below 7.5 million tonnes. The DMH - 11 Mustard variety was developed to reduce India's dependence on foreign oil imports for human consumption. On an annual basis, India approximately spends Rs. 60,000 crore ($10.5 billion) on 14.5 million tonnes of edible oil imports, with over 60% of domestic edible oil demands being met only through supplies from overseas. Increasing domestic yields of mustard oil would significantly reduce India's dependency on oil imports and the associated costs. The transgenic mustard variety DMH - 11 was developed by Dr. Deepak Pental, and his colleagues from the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants at the University of Delhi, South Campus. It took 14 years and approximately Rs. 700 million to successfully create the DMH - 11 variety. If approved, DMH - 11 will be the first genetically modified food crop to be commercially cultivated in India. The project to develop DMH - 11 received funding from the National Dairy Development Board of India, as well as the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). Development =Methods and mechanism= The transgenic mustard DMH - 11 was developed in 2002 using genetic material isolated from non-pathogenic soil bacteria, and techniques in transgenic systems for pollination control, which primarily involved the Barnase-Barstar system. Three genes, Bar, Barnase and Barstar, were extracted from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to produce the hybrid seed. The main reason for introducing the Barnase-Barstar gene system into the transgenic mustard line, was for heterosis breeding and to prevent self-fertilization. The insertion of the Barnase gene induces genetic male sterility by preventing the production of the male gametophytes (pollen grains) in the mustard plant. Meanwhile, the Barstar gene acts to restore the ability of the plant to produce fertile hybrid seeds. Mustard is a self-pollinating plant, thus, making it difficult to perform cross-pollination with another desired male parental line, without the occurrence of self-pollination. The Barnase gene induced male sterility in DMH - 11, simplifying the process of cross pollination to derive new hybrid varieties. The two parental strains used to develop DMH -11 are the Early Hira mutant (EH -2) which was developed by Anil Khalatkar of Nagpur University, and the Varuna bn 3.6. The seed weight of DHM-11 is reported to be around 3.3 to 3.5 grams (0.12 oz)/1000 seeds. DMH - 11's Glufosinate resistance is due to an enzyme expressed by the Bar (Bialaphos resistance) gene. Derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, the cloned Bar gene in DMH-11 encodes for the synthesis of phosphinothricin-N- acetyl-transferase (PAT). This enzyme is responsible for detoxifying the active ingredient in the herbicide Glufosinate : phosphinothricin. Phosphinothricin's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of Glutamine synthetase, which prevents the detoxification of ammonia and subsequently causes toxic buildup within plant cells. Inhibition of glutamine synthetase also leads to an overall reduction in Glutamine levels. In plants, Glutamine acts as a signalling molecule, and as a major amino acid donor for nucleotide synthesis. PAT enzymes produced by the Bar gene, deactivate Bialaphos (the tripeptide precursor to phosphinothricin) through acetylation to form an inactive, non-toxic product. =Safety evaluation= In September 2015, the University of Delhi South Campus submitted an application to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee requesting permission for environmental release of DMH - 11. Prior to commercialisation, the mustard hybrid was subject to a confined bio-safety field evaluation, formally known as a Bio- safety Research Level (BRL) trial, under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). This trial was carried out in 2014-2015 after being granted permission from the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), India's apex regulator of transgenic products. The safety studies done for DMH - 11 were assigned to the following categories : molecular characterisation, food safety, environmental safety and detection protocols. Molecular characterisation involves expression studies of the Bar, Barnase and Barstar genes inserted into DMH - 11's DNA sequence. Food safety tests examined the toxicity of the three proteins in DMH - 11, using compositional and bioinformatics analysis. Environmental safety trials tested the potential for weediness, and aggressive parameters of DMH - 11. The details and results of these safety trials have not been made public yet. There is a summary of the safety evaluation available online, however, the raw data has been withheld from the public by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). It can only be accessed through an application to the MoEF. The official 133-page safety assessment of DMH - 11, entitled \\"Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety of GE Mustard\\", was uploaded onto GEAC's website for public feedback, where it received 750 comments from members of the public. These comments were then reviewed by a sub-committee, and incorporated into the final safety evaluation report submitted to GEAC. The report inferred that DMH - 11 was safe for human consumption, and contains nutritious value. Anita Prasad, the chairperson of the GEAC, announced that the commission will positively recommend DMH - 11 to Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave for planting. The GEAC initially cleared DMH - 11 for commercial cultivation, however, they retracted their approval upon deciding that more tests, and additional data concerning the effect of DMH - 11 on insect pollinators, in particular honeybees, and on soil microbial diversity was needed prior to commercialisation. The Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants at the University of Delhi applied for permission to grow DMH - 11 plots in Delhi and Punjab, to test the effects of the transgenic mustard on honeybees. In March 2018, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee approved DMH - 11 for field studies to investigate its potential effects on honeybees and other pollinating insects. The field trials will be conducted at the Punjab Agriculture University and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute. Controversy =Health effects= The Honorable Supreme Court of India appointed a Technical Expert Committee (TEC) which in its 2013 report recommended a total ban on herbicide-tolerant transgenic crops. One of the reasons the TEC cited was the possibility of ensuing negative health effects as a result of farmers generously applying herbicide to their crops. =Ecological effects= A major reason for to DMH - 11 being commercialised is the potential formation of 'super weeds'. DMH - 11 is Glufosinate tolerant, and therefore it is thought to encourage farmers to liberally spray the herbicide upon commercialisation. This causes an artificial selection pressure on weeds which could result in the emergence of Glufosinate-resistant weed species. The biggest concern, however, with regards to DMH - 11 being commercially cultivated, is the potential genetic pollution of the rich biodiversity of the genus Brassica, via cross pollination between DMH-11 and wild populations. Mustard plants undergo wind and insect mediated pollination. Due to its susceptibility to outcrossing, there is a possibility of India's rich mustard germplasm consisting of wild varieties and domesticated landraces being irreversibly contaminated. =Social and economic effects= In 2004, the chairman of the Task Force in Agricultural Biotechnology advised against commercialisation of herbicide-resistant crops as they eliminate the need for manual weeding, a job undertaken by many rural women in India. It was estimated by Kavita Kuruganti, a member of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, that growing even 25% of DMH - 11 will result in a loss of 4.25 crore employment days for many women. Another reason for the strong opposition against the commercialisation of DMH - 11 across India, is due to past negative experiences with GM crops, most notably Bt cotton in Maharashtra. There was a proposed link between the poor performance of Bt cotton, and a large number of farmers' suicides, particularly in 2004. DMH - 11 protesters believe that exorbitant seed prices, coupled with low yields could lead to financial hardship, economic stress and possibly more suicide among farmers. The link between GE crop cultivation and farmer suicides, however, has been shown to be unsubstantiated by available data, despite being used as a common talking point against agricultural biotechnology within India. Performance =Yield= DMH - 11 demonstrated yield heterosis in the range of 19%‚Äì40% over some of the best Indian varieties. There are, however, two traits that have been found to be poorly developed and expressed in the hybrid variety; these are seed size and siliqua length. Both of these traits are important yield components. Another multi-site trial conducted under field conditions found the DMH - 11 to produce 30% more yield than existing strains of traditional mustard varieties. = Allergenic potential = DMH - 11 was also subject to a food allergenicity test using bioinformatics comparisons following CODEX and ICMR guidelines, to examine whether the amino acid sequence of Bar, Barnase and Bastar proteins were potential allergens. The test was carried out by identifying any similarities between the amino acid sequence of the three proteins, to that of other known putative allergens. The potential open reading frames at the DNA insertion site of the three genes, were assessed for potential similarities to existing allergens in the AllergenOnline.org database. The results of the study found that DMH - 11 does not present any risk of food allergy to consumers. Further trials on DMH - 11 have been suggested, such as performing a human serum IgE test.

They were initially enacted to offset the economic imbalances which resulted from the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The reforms focused heavily on the macroeconomic stabilization of the Cuban economy. This was to achieved through a reduction in fiscal deficit, and through structural changes such as the enactment of the Free Farmer's Market agreement, the legalization of self-employment, and the decriminalization of the United States dollar. The economic reforms resulted in a decrease in inflation, appreciation of the Peso, increase in output and productivity, and in an improvement in the fiscal deficit.  Cuban economy prior to reform  COMECON Logo The Cuban Economy faced its lowest recessions during the War of Independence, 1890s, The Great Depression, 1930s, The Socialist Revolution, 1960s, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, 1990s. As tensions between Cuba and the United States increased following the Bay of Pigs Invasion and Cuba Missile Crisis, Cuba increasingly turned to the Soviet Union for economic and military aid. From 1970-1980, the Soviet Union was fully immersed in Cuba's economic affairs. In 1972, Cuba joined the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, COMECON, and by the end of the 1980s, 85% of Cuba's trade was done with the member of COMECON. From 1985 to 1989, 74.4% of all Cuban exports were sugar and related products. The Cuban economy was highly dependent on sugar, which rendered the country's economy vulnerable to price fluctuations in the world market. Following the surge in world prices, sugar production fell from 7.3 million tons in 1989 to 4.1 million tons in 1993. For 30 years, Cuba relied on the Soviet Union's subsidies. Towards the end of 1989, Soviet assistance decreased due to the budgetary problems the country was facing at the time. The former General Secretary of the Soviet Union , who later went on to become president, Mikhail Gorbachev ended the Cuban-Soviet exchange of sugar for oil, and demanded the immediate repayment of the debt. Later in 1991, president Boris Yeltsin put all assistance to Cuba to a halt. Imports fell by 50% from 1990 to 1993, consequently the GDP decreased by 30%.  Course of reform  Capitol Building in Havana The collapse of the Soviet Union sent the Cuban economy into a recession from 1989 to 1993, when it reached its lowest point. In a speculated attempt to re-join the IMF and the World Bank, executive director Jacques de Groote and another IMF official were invited to Havana in late 1993. After assessing the economic situation in the country they concluded that from 1989 to 1993, the Cuba's economic decline was more grave than that experienced by any other socialist Eastern European country. During those 4 years, foreign trade fell by 80%, as more than half of Cuba's trade was done with the Soviet Union, and there was a roughly 50% drop in the country's GDP during that period. The then-president, Fidel Castro, declared that as of 30 August 1990, the period would be known as the Special Period ( Spanish: Periodo Especial) in Time of Peace, which revolved around moving people from urban to rural areas to increase focus on the agricultural sector. = 1993-1994 = In 1993 the Cuban government legalized the possession and circulation of foreign exchange In. July 1993, it was announced was now legal to possess American dollars, through Decree Law no 140, which was instated on 13 August 1993. The law aimed at stimulating external remittances from Cubans living in the United States transfer dollars during a time when there was a shortage of dollars in Cuba. This law made it possible for Cubans to sell goods and services to foreigners who were visiting the island and resulted in increase in capital. On October 26, 1994, the government established a new system of sales of artisan and manufactured goods at prices equivalent to prices at the free agricultural markets. These allowed individuals and state enterprises to sell goods and services at appointed locations while they were still subjected to transaction tax which was equivalent to sales tax, and they allowed factories to sell surplus from their production. The system was aimed at weakening the black market and stimulating production. As on November 1994, the black market exchange rate fell from CU$120=US$1 to CU$40=US$1. By October 1995, exchange bureaus had been created which allowed civilians to buy and sell currencies at rates which were close to black market rates. In 1993, the government also made strides in promoting foreign investment. On 8 September 1993, the government enacted Decree Law No. 141 on Independent Labour which re-authorized Own Account Work with the aim of increasing the labour supply. = 1994-1996 = In July 1994, the government introduced bonuses for workers. They provided a USD$20 monthly pay package some incentives for workers to stimulate productivity in trade activities namely exports and import substitution (i.e. oil production, electrical generation, biotechnology and cement steel). On December 20, 1994, the government announced a new free convertible peso, which was on par with the US dollar and could be used in dollar stores, was to exist alongside the old peso, and its ultimate intent was to substitute both the old peso and the dollar. To combat the fiscal deficit in the country, the government raised the prices of selected goods such as cigarettes, alcoholic beverages and gasoline in 1995. The government also raised the rates for public services such as telephone, transportation and electricity. The government also announced the elimination of some government agencies. 11,600 positions in 32 ministries were eliminated to reduce subsidies. In 1995, the Cuban government legalised Self- Employment. This resulted in a fall of government payroll and increase in revenues. The government also announced that as of 1995, taxes will be imposed on real estate, on services such as advertising, on self-employed workers, and on Cuban‚Äôs whose source of income stems from foreign businesses.  Reform in specific sectors  = Agriculture = On September 30, 1994, the Cuban government enacted its plan to allow free agricultural markets, and more controlled variety of free farmer‚Äôs markets (MLC). This allowed farmers to once again legally sell the surplus from their yield (except for meat, milk and potatoes) and make profits. This encouraged farms to grow more food and black-market prices slowly fell. Moreover, the conversion of Soviet-style farms into basic cooperative production units freed up 42% of Cuba‚Äôs usable land. By 1997, roughly 76% of Cuba‚Äôs usable land was held by cooperatives. In September 1995, Cuban government decreased subsidies to agriculture, from $370 million in 1994 to $57 million in 1995. = Banking = Prior to 1997, Cuba‚Äôs banking system mainly consisted of the Cuban Nacional Bank (Banco Nacional de Cuba, BNC), the People‚Äôs Savings Bank (Banco Popular de Ahorro, BPA) and International Financing Bank ( Banco Financiero Internacional, S.A. BFI). In 1993, the BNC created a private company, New Banking Group (Grupo Nueva Banca, S.A., GNB), to expand financial services available to foreign investors such as credit card operations, provision of the free convertible peso and exchange of bills. The GNB had a network of new financial institutions such as International Bank of Commerce (Banco Internacional de Comercio, S.A., BICSA), National Financier (Financiera Nacional, S.A., FINSA), and Investment Bank (Banco de Inversiones, S.A.). In 1994, ING Bank of Holland began operating in Cuba, making it the first foreign bank to be granted a license to operate in the island. In 1995, 2 more foreign banks were granted a similar license, namely the Soci√©t√© Gen√©ral√© de France and Banco Sabadell from Spain. In 1997, the Cuban government established a new central bank, Cuban Central Bank (Banco Central de Cuba, BCC) with the aim of liberalizing the financial system. Under Decree-Law 172, the new central bank was to maintain monetary stability, preserve the value of the currency and supervise the banking system in Cuba. By late 1998, 15 foreign banks had opened branch representatives in Cuba. The banking system was computerized with the introduction of cash dispensing machines and modernized check-clearing systems . Banco Popular de Ahorro, which mainly focused on loans and savings for families, broadened its services to its activities to commercial banking services and foreign exchange window. = Finance = Following the decriminalization of the possession of American Dollars in 1993, the government created special stores in which individuals who possessed the USD could shop for items not available to individuals who only possessed the peso. Moreover, by September 1995, it was possible to deposit hard currency with interest in the Cuban National Bank, by October of that same year, the government had created Foreign Currency Exchange houses (Casas de Cambio, CADECA) with 23 branches throughout the island where Cubans could exchange USD for pesos at a rate similar to that of the Black Market. = Foreign Investment = In December 1994, National Assembly passed a new mining law which aimed at simplifying foreign investment in mining sector. The following year, the National Assembly introduced a law which innovated the legal framework for foreign investment, by simplifying the evaluating process for future foreign investment, by inhibiting foreign investment in real estate and by authorising the establishment of export processing zones which aim to encourage industrial and promotional activity. In 1995, the Cuban government signed a trade and investment promotion, and protection agreement with more than 12 countries including Russia, Canada and China. The Havana International Trade Fair attracted 1690 companies from 52 countries. US interest in the island grew. The Economist reported that from 1994 and 1996, 1500 representatives from American firms visited the island.  Impact  After the success of the stabilization program enacted in 1993, Cuba‚Äôs budget deficit decreased to 1 billion pesos in 1994, 480 million pesos in 1995, and 36 million pesos in 1996. In 1994, there was as 7.6% growth in the manufacturing sector and a 4.4% growth in the electricity sector. In the following year, 1995, manufacturing sector grew by 6.4% more and there was a 56% and 7.7% growth in mining and construction sectors respectively. Manufacturing sector continued to grow and in 1997 it registered a 7.7% growth in output. In the same year, the construction sector grew by 4.8%, and the transportation and forestry sectors grew by 4.6% and 13.6% respectively. The reforms also impacted the trade balance of the country. In 1994, exports increased by 18% amounting to roughly $1.3 billion, and imports increased by $2.1billion. In the following years, 1996 and 1997, exports grew to $1.5 and $2.0 billion respectively, nonetheless the island‚Äôs imports was growing at a faster rate, registering a 33% growth in 1996 and a 19% growth in 1997. Moreover, the reforms also brought about a growth in the investment sector. According to an official statement made by Vice President Carlos Lage in November 1994, investments in that year totalled $1.5 billion. In 1995, investments grew from $1.5 billion to $2.1 billion, a 37.5% growth. By the end of 1995, more than 212 foreign investors had started projects in Cuba, and 1996 saw the addition of 48 more internationally funded projects. In August 1995, the Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations, Bruno Rodriguez, reported that 100 American companies had showed interest in state-owned businesses in Cuba. By the end of 1997, the number of internationally funded projects had grown to 317. In 1989, there were 28,600 licensed self-employed individuals in Cuba, after the legalisation of self-employment in 1995, this number rose to 200,000  Criticism  The economic reforms were criticised for renouncing the socialist views in which the country was rebuilt upon after the Cuban revolution, to which Fidel Castro responded by saying \\"We have not renounced socialism as our common objective....We have to be ready to conduct necessary changes to adapt to present world conditions ‚Äπwithout renouncing our ideas and without renouncing our objectives.\\". Moreover, the self-employment reform was criticised for not allowing students to be self-employed.

Through his maternal grandfather Hugh Jackson, he was a first cousin of President Andrew Jackson.  Early life  Hugh Hill was born 1 August 1740 to John and Elizabeth Hill in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland, of Scotch-Irish ancestry. At the age of fifteen, Hill left home to join the English navy as a cabin boy. Without any formal schooling, Hill managed to acquire a rudimentary school education through the help of sailors. Upon leaving the naval service, Hill went to Marblehead, Massachusetts, where he married Hannah Goudy on 13 March 1766 at the age of 25. Not long afterward he moved to Beverly to the north where he found work as a mariner.  Privateer activities  With a professed strong hatred of the British government, Hugh Hill was a strong proponent of the Patriot cause from the beginning. In 1775, he was named captain of the privateering vessel Pilgrim by the Cabot brothers of Beverly and sent to disrupt British activity in the Atlantic. In that same year he captured the British ship Industry, which he delivered to George Washington. Over the span of the war, Hill went on to successfully capture a multitude of British merchant vessels with the Pilgrim and later the Cicero, which he was commissioned master of in 1781, on the account of the Cabots. Many of his successful captures were made off the coast of Great Britain and Ireland, and he earned a notoriously infamous reputation among British captains stationed near there as a \\"scourge of the British coast.\\" According to Beverly historian Edwin M. Stone, \\"probably more captured vessels were brought into this port than into any other in New England, the cargoes of which furnished important and seasonable supplies for the Continental Army.\\" Hill was known for his commanding presence, strong nerves, and craftiness on the open seas and was notable for his use of false flag operation while privateering, flying the British flag on his vessels as a decoy before unleashing the American flag when on the attack. While infamous within British circles, he was known to be humane to his prisoners. In 1781, he captured the ship Mars in the Irish Channel which had on board the extensive and famous Philosophical Library of Dr. Richard Kirwan of Dublin. Upon bringing the plunder to Beverly, the library was auctioned off and later became a basis for the foundation of the Salem Athenaeum.  Post-war life  Hill was made famous by his privateer activities and was personally thanked by George Washington for his actions. Following the war, Hill went to Ireland with the Cicero and advertised the transport of passengers to America. In 1784, he brought back to America his aging parents along with his brothers and sisters. In 1794, he bought for his family the farming estate of Chipman Hill in North Beverly. Under his name he successfully operated a wharf and warehouse on Beverly Harbor, and set his brothers up in the business upon their arrival in America. Additionally, he maintained a 1780-built house on Front Street which still stands today. At this point his first wife Hannah appears to have died and he married his second wife, Jane Gardner Brown Hill (1772-1855). With Jane, he had five children. Meanwhile in 1810, his niece Hannah Hill set up in another house on Front Street, with neighbor Joanna Batchelder, one of the first Sunday schools in America.  Death  Hugh Hill died a prominent citizen of Beverly at his Chipman Hill farm on 17 February 1829, at the age of 88. He is buried in the city's Central Cemetery in a family plot.  Legacy  Due to his successful privateering efforts in the American War of Independence, Hill is remembered in Beverly as a Revolutionary War Hero whom, along with the launching of the Hannah in Glover's Wharf as the first official vessel of the Continental Navy, made the town notable during the conflict and era. In honor of him and other privateers, but with his visage most prominent, the Beverly Historical Society today operates a \\"Privateer Trail Walking Tour\\" during the summer through the Front Street area of Beverly where he owned his home and operated his business. Chipman Hill, the site of Hill's farmstead in North Beverly, was later turned into the site of the Old Salem Reservoir, and now serves as the site of several businesses and institutions on Tozer and Sohier Roads and adjoins with the sites of Beverly High School and Beverly Hospital.

Proceedings of the 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, Big Island, HI: IEEE, pp. 4603-4612.  Overview  Business capability models represent high-level views of an organization from the perspective of its business capabilities.Keller, W. (2015) \\"Using Capability Models for Strategic Alignment\\", In: Simon, D. and Schmidt, C. (eds.) Business Architecture Management: Architecting the Business for Consistency and Alignment, Berlin: Springer, pp. 107-122. Essentially, they briefly describe everything that an organization can do. Business capability models are very stable and organizationally neutral in nature. They are largely independent of specific organizational structures, reporting relationships, political agendas and cultural aspects of individual business leaders, current initiatives and projects. Furthermore, most changes happening in organizations do not affect the fundamental structure of their business capability models.  Contents  Business capability models are structured in a hierarchical manner, i.e. each higher-level business capability includes multiple constituting lower-level capabilities. They can have several nested levels of depth and granularity, typically from two to four distinct abstraction levels depending on the size, complexity and experience of an organization.Burton, B. (2010) \\"Eight Business Capability Modeling Best Practices\\" (#G00175782), Stamford, CT: Gartner.Burton, B. (2012) \\"Eight Business Capability Modeling Best Practices Enhance Business and IT Collaboration\\" (#G00245455), Stamford, CT: Gartner.Cantara, M., Burton, B. and Scheibenreif, D. (2016) \\"Eight Best Practices for Creating High-Impact Business Capability Models\\" (#G00314568), Stamford, CT: Gartner. At the highest level, often considered as level zero, all business capabilities can be separated into customer-facing (front office) capabilities and operational (back office) capabilities. Top-level business capabilities can be also organized according to main organizational functions, e.g. enable, manage and run, or aligned to core activities of the value chain, e.g. logistics, operations, sales and service. Underlying lower-level business capabilities are naturally more numerous and fine-grained. Specific business capabilities in business capability models can be titled using either a noun- verb style or a verb-noun style, e.g. \\"product development\\" or \\"develop products\\". In their simplest form business capability models can show only structured sets of nested business capabilities and sub-capabilities. However, more sophisticated versions of these EA artifacts can also provide additional information regarding an organization and its environment relevant for strategic decision-making. Complex business capability models often include an organizational mission, strategy and vision, document its long-term goals, objectives and constraints and even show the most important elements of its external business environment that should be taken into account during strategic planning, e.g. key competitors, strategic partners, major suppliers, target markets, core customer groups, industry regulators or some other critical elements of the organizational context.  Development  Since business capability models offer only a very high-level view of an organization, usually they can be created rather quickly. Perfect accurateness and correctness are not among their most important or critical qualities. Moreover, more intuitive and simple business capability models are more likely to resonate with the thought processes of business executives.Greski, L. (2009) \\"Business Capability Modeling: Theory & Practice\\", Architecture and Governance Magazine, Vol. 5, No. 7, pp. 1-4. In many industries the development of business capability models can be accelerated via taking openly available industry-standard reference models or even proprietary generic reference models provided by commercial vendors as the basis for producing customized, organization-specific capability models. In some cases, separate parts of business capability models representing common groups of the most typical capabilities, e.g. customer management or product management, can be borrowed from other industries and adapted to the organizational needs.  Usage  Business capability models are often used for strategic planning up to 3-5 years ahead in the future. Business executives and architects usually discuss the relative importance of different business capabilities from the strategic perspective, identify the capabilities requiring the most significant enhancements in the long run and then employ the so-called technique of heatmapping, i.e. explicitly highlighting or color-coding the business capabilities that should become the primary focus of future IT investments.\\"Fake and Real Tools for Enterprise Architecture: The Zachman Framework and Business Capability Model\\", Kotusev, S., August 2019Weldon, L. and Burton, B. (2011) \\"Use Business Capability Modeling to Illustrate Strategic Business Priorities\\" (#G00217535), Stamford, CT: Gartner. Often the necessary strategic capability improvements can be also classified into different types reflecting the nature of these improvements, e.g. fundamentally new business operations should be added to the capability, the quality of current operations should be raised or the existing capability should be performed at lower cost, and then color-coded appropriately in business capability models. In some cases completely new business capabilities that need to be developed from scratch may be added to business capability models and heatmapped accordingly, while some existing capabilities that lost their importance may be removed as irrelevant. The set of heatmapped business capabilities in business capability models represents a consensus understanding of the organizational focus and strategic priorities agreed by business and IT. In their turn, these business capabilities provide a sound basis for further, more detailed IT planning. Using heatmapped business capabilities as a starting point for IT planning, architects and business leaders can propose candidate IT initiatives intended to uplift these capabilities and thereby directly contribute to the execution of a business strategy. By means of heatmapping, business capability models offer very effective instruments for translating an abstract business strategy into more specific and actionable plans for IT. Essentially, they help view an entire organization as an investment portfolio with different types of assets, proactively focus IT investments on the assets with highest returns and achieve the greatest possible strategic impact. However, not all enhancements of business capabilities can be relevant to IT, especially the ones related to people aspects. Besides highlighting the most critical target capabilities for future IT investments and indicating respective maturity levels and capability gaps, business capability models can be also color-coded in many other useful ways to facilitate strategic decision-making. For example, business capability models can be color-coded to distinguish core capabilities from non-core ones and thereby identify the opportunities for outsourcing. While core capabilities should be cultivated and mastered within an organization, non- core capabilities can be considered as good candidates for outsourcing with minimal business risk. Business capability models have many other helpful uses in organizations. Firstly, they enable the so-called initiative footprinting, i.e. mapping of specific IT initiatives to the affected business capabilities. This footprinting helps understand the contribution of corresponding IT initiatives to the overall strategic direction, identify their potential sponsors and stakeholders, determine their scope, effect and disruption. Better understanding of specific IT initiatives and their impact, in its turn, enables a more informed comparison between different initiatives as well as between different possible implementation options of the same initiative. Secondly, mapping of the accomplished or planned IT investments to business capability models helps understand how the IT budget is allocated and where IT dollars are going. Finally, business capability models provide a common language, shared vocabulary and unified organization-wide reference points to all stakeholders involved in decision-making processes.

It was built from 1810 to 1817 by convict labour. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Dr. Charles Throsby arrived in New South Wales in 1802 as a surgeon on the transport \\"Coromandel\\". He took the post of acting surgeon and magistrate at Castle Hill and was transferred to Newcastle in 1804, where he became commandant for four years. In 1809 Throsby resigned from the positions of Assistant Colonial Surgeon and Magistrate. During this period he had established grazing in the Newcastle area. On 22 May 1811 Throsby was granted 950 acres of land (at Casula) which he named \\"Glenfield\\" after his birthplace, Glenfield, Leicestershire in England. The farmhouse was built in about 1817.Leary, 1979, 151 From March to April 1818, he travelled on a tour of discovery to Jervis Bay. Throsby's exploration included the discovery of the Wollondilly River, exploration of the country around Goulburn, the first visit of white men to the Federal Capital area and the cross country trek between Goulburn and Bathurst. The discovery of the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River and another route between the tableland of the Shoalhaven River and a possible route between the tableland and the coast of Jervis Bay are also attributed to Throsby. In April and May 1819 Throsby undertook his tour to Bathurst through the Cow Pastures and in May 1819, Governor Macquarie offered him a grant of land as remuneration for services rendered in making important discoveries. So impressed was Macquarie with Throsby's explorations, that he offered him public tribute his zealous perseverance - and granted him 1000 acres of land in the Moss Vale area. Dr. Throsby's nephew, also named Charles Throsby, arrived in New South Wales on the \\"Mangles\\" on 7 August 1820. He joined his uncle and took charge of Throsby Park on the Wingecarribee River (near present day Moss Vale). On 19 August 1820, Joseph Wild (of Throsby's party and under his direction) discovered Lake George, and in 1821 Throsby made the first mention of the possibility of the Murrumbidgee River of which he had heard from Aboriginal people. In April 1821, Charles Throsby reached the Murrumbidgee somewhere in what is now the Australian Capital Territory. Governor Macquarie made Throsby a magistrate of the territory in March 1821, with main jurisdiction over the new County of Argyle. He was also a member of the committee for the first Agricultural Society in Sydney. During this time, Throsby had been involved in financial troubles brought on by a 5,000 pound surety he had taken on behalf of Graham Blaxcell. Blaxcell absconded from the colony in 1817 and died on board ship, leaving Throsby at the mercy of the creditors. Ten years' litigation ended in an adverse verdict for Throsby, who by 1828 was also affected by the drought and falling wool prices. In April 1825, Charles Throsby committed suicide at Glenfield Farm, aged 51. Upon Dr Throsby's death, nephew Charles inherited Glenfield, Throsby Park and other scattered parts of his uncle's properties. After Charles' death Glenfield Farm was passed down successive heirs in the Throsby-Broughton family. In 1920 James Leacock purchased Glenfield Farm. In 1924 he married a Broughton and in 1930 they moved into Glenfield Farm after modifying the homestead to serve as a dual residence, accommodating himself and his wife in one half and his sister and mother in the other. This dual dwelling arrangement began in 1932. James Leacock brought dairy farming to the Liverpool district. He formed the Hygenic Dairies Ltd at Concord in 1909 to supply Sydney with its first bottled milk. His idealism embraced many interests, ranging from organic farming to Aboriginal rights. He undertook many activities on the farm property which made Glenfield a meeting place for groups concerned for Australian and international justice and many humanitarian issues. Leacock pursued the establishment of communal living, discussion centres and co-operative farming. The first serious co-operative was the Rural Homes (Glenfield) Co-operative Ltd, formed in 1951. In 1960 the co-operative went into insolvency. In 1970 the Glenfield Goodwill Co-operative Society was registered. A decline in the co-operative spirit was brought to a head at the 1976 Annual General Meeting, when it was decided that the Co-operative should be terminated. However, the Co-operative adopted a more realistic landlord role and increased rents to near market levels. After the venture failed Leacock bought back the farm and approximately 14 acres on which he resided until his death in 1974. The residents at Glenfield Farm continued farming activities. A 1977 student report by Mark Bullen & Ian McGilvray indicated that the vegetation associated with the estate was mostly confined to the ridge with cleared land used for grazing and market gardening to the east. The Heritage Council of NSW commissioned Howard Tanner and Associates to carry out a measured survey and report, providing staged recommendations and proposals for the place's future use. Glenfield was found to be in an advanced stage of dilapidation, and following completion of the study a grant from the Heritage Conservation Fund enabled the first stage of repair works to be carried out. Architects Howard Tanner and Tim Throsby supervised the first stage of roof repairs which was completed in September 1983. During repairs, photographic documentation was carried out and evidence was uncovered that confirmed the original sequence of construction. The original timber shingles had been overlaid during the 19th century by patent Morewood and Rogers galvanised iron sheets for tiles. These were either repaired or replaced and correct flashing details reintroduced. In the 1980s, the Glenfield Cooperative regularly opened the house for public inspection while drawing income from its farm activities. The remaining estate was subsequently incorporated into a residential subdivision, with Leacock's Lane (named after the family of a previous owner, Jim Leacock) as its main circulation ring road (off the Hume Highway). A draft plan of management for Leacock Regional Park was commissioned in 1996.Britton & Morris, 2000, 4.4., 39 In 2002-03, a federal heritage grant of $46,393 was awarded for urgent works. In 2003, the property was purchased by the NSW Department of Planning, and Mayne-Wilson & Associates prepared a conservation management plan for it. The property was transferred to the NSW Historic Houses Trust in 2006, the first to be included in the then-new Endangered Houses Fund program. At that time, most of the site (5.518ha) was transferred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for incorporation into the adjoining Leacock Regional Park, while 1.173ha was retained as part of the property. The house was then restored by the Historic Houses Trust, including restoring and reconstructing original details, reconstructing the garden, improving water tanks and installing new wet areas and conveniences. The restoration won an AIA (Heritage) Architecture Award in 2008. It was subsequently sold back to private ownership as a residence. In 2015, the new owners expressed public concern that the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal would impact the property, potentially making the house unlivable due to train noise.  Description  Glenfield is at Casula, located 5km south of Liverpool and accessed by Leacock's Lane, off the Hume Highway. It is surrounded to the south and north by Leacock Regional Park, with the main Southern Railway and a large area of landfill to the east, and 1988 residential subdivision, fronting Leacock's Lane, to the west.Clive Lucas, Stapleton & Partners, 2007, 2 The land to the east of the site consists of former rural pastures and the original site fencing. The buildings on the property are located to the western part of the site on top of a ridge and contain a 14 room homestead, a dairy, coach house and privy.NPWS, 2007, 2 Glenfield comprises a complex of 4 historic brick buildings (an 1810-17 house, former single storey dairy, two storey stables and small privy), surrounded by shrubs and trees, sited on the eastern side of a ridge that slopes steeply to the east down to Glenfield Creek and the Georges River. Panoramic views from the site are afforded to the north, south and east over the river valley. =Homestead= The homestead is a Colonial Georgian convict-built homestead of 14 rooms with kitchen, pantry and cellar. The roof extends over the stone flagged verandahs on three sides and is supported on turned wooden columns. The wooden shingles of the original roof can still be seen under the iron. The house has brick cellars and two attic rooms with gable windows facing the prospect to the east. The English Bond brickwork construction is of a very high quality, particularly evident in the cellars, where arches support the walls above. The bricks are made from local clay. The lime in both the mortar and render is made from crushed oyster shell, with the latter clearly visible. The joinery throughout is cedar. There are six-panelled doors and french windows with small wooden panels at the base and small glass panes held in fine wooden glazing bars. The mouldings of the architraves and chimney pieces are typical of Colonial Georgian design. =Outbuildings= ;The Barn > \\"The barn is probably contemporary with the Glenfield Farm house and is > closely associated with it. Its floor was renewed recently in hard brick. > The ground floor contained a place for the family carriage with a workroom > adjoining, where harness and tools could be kept and repaired. The upper > floor provided dry storage space for hay and other stock feed...There is a > dummy doorway and two windows.\\" (in Kingston, 1990, 25). Two-storey building, possibly used as stables At the rear of the house there is an imposing two-storey brick building that may have been used for stables, barn or even as another dwelling house. The symmetrically placed recesses and openings on the ground floor with their semi-circular arches suggest that this building was erected at a later date than the house, possibly in the 1820s or 1830s.Cumberland County Council 1963 ;Remnant Farm Originally a 600 acre grant to Dr Charles Throsby in 1809. Part of 1500 acres granted to Throsby in the Minto area. Macquarie passed through the farm on his 1810 tour of inspection, implying that farm buildings were likely to have been built around that time. In 1859 the farm of 1000 acres was leased as a working dairy farm with a mile of river frontage to the George's River, including large areas of rye, field peas, corn and sugarcane as well as 200 fruit trees and vegetable gardens. An underground dairy produced quality butter. Outbuildings included piggeries, cow yards, two large farm sheds, four new farm huts and a substantial brick four-stall stable and coach house with a granary above. Early 20th century, it was subdivided and sold by Archer Broughton Throsby, although he was recorded as still residing at Glenfield Farm on his death in 1925. In 1920 James Freeland Leacock, who had married a descendant of the Broughton family of Appin, bought Glenfield for a dairy farm. Surviving elements such as old fenceposts remain on the estate. =Garden= The key elements of its garden are the 19th century Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla) and early 20th century pepper trees, the old water cistern and terracing of the northern garden area, including the tennis court. A clump of giant bamboo (Bambusa balcooa) defines one edge of the garden. Younger trees include Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) a pair of which flank the front door facing west. Two bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii) have been planted on axis with the western entrance door of the homestead. A clump of gian bamboo defines the edge of the gardene area of the farm. Silky oaks (Grevillea robusta), African olives (Olea africana), pepper trees / peppercorns (Schinus areira), and more recent eucalypts make up the dominant tree canopy around the homestead complex. =Landscape context= Entrance gate The entrance gates to Glenfield Farm contrast with a hard suburban treatment to the road, of street trees, kerb and guttering, and standard road surface. These elements are intrusive on its setting. Standard residential subdivision from 1988 surrounds Glenfield Farm on the south, west and north, to the edge of the escarpment. Its nature, and proximity, for example with houses abutting right up to the western edge of Leacock's Lane, is unfortunate, compromising the setting of Glenfield Farm, and obscuring its traditional views from each of the three entrance driveways/ paths looking west up to the remnant vegetated ridgeline beyond. Only from the east is a more open aspect still evident, with a steep slope to Glenfield Creek, the southern railway line, George's River and a large area of landfill to the south-east. Two residences, one a modern brick construction, have been built adjoining Glenfield Farm east of Leacock's Lane. The curtilage of Glenfield Farm wraps around these lots. = Modifications and dates = * 600 acre grant to Dr Charles Throsby in 1809.

It is associated in the 19th century with Dr Charles Throsby, an eminent colonial officer and explorer of his time (1802-1828) and in the 20th century with James Leacock, an innovative dairy farmer, entrepreneur and idealist. Its buildings provide valuable evidence of the architectural style and nature of construction of rural buildings during the early days of European settlement, as well as the lifestyle of those who occupied it. The homestead is one of very few buildings in the State that has been continuously occupied as a private residence. The survival of all buildings relatively intact is remarkable, and is valued by the community. Taken as a whole, the grounds of Glenfield Farm that remain have the capability to demonstrate both the core activities of the farm, and, to a modest degree, the planting tastes, garden layout, and functional requirements of successive occupants. Their approach was, for the most part, pragmatic and utilitarian - as is often the case with dairy farms - and cumulatively the grounds have high heritage significance (sic). Glenfield Farm compares well with its colonial farm peers, in terms of having: # an original, very early farmhouse (1810-1817) still intact and used as a family residence; # virtually all its outbuildings, intact and substantial; # been associated with two very prominent men and their descendants throughout its long history; # retained, without significant alteration, its geometric Georgian style architecture; # a modest capability for animal agistment or horticulture (on the footslopes and flats); # a modest degree of visual prominence from the east (and railway line).Mayne-Wilson & Associates, 2002 Glenfield is associated with Dr. Charles Throsby, his nephew Charles Throsby and his family.NSW Planning & Environment Commission 1977This farm is the oldest continuously worked farm in Australia, and its buildings rank among the earliest buildings in the country for their design and workmanship.Earle 1974 An intact early building group with elements of its garden and part of its original farm estate intact, with more of the broader estate area still discernable beyond. The homestead and garden complex can still be appreciated to some extent in their original relationship with the escarpment and Glenfield Creek valley, as can some of their traditional view prospects. There are components of the place that have individual significances such as the various buildigns, the remnant garden, archaeological resources and layout. The place has strong associations with various notable individuals including the Throsby family and James Leacock. The place retains its traditional prominence along the ridge from the east, as a local landmark. The place is of considerable scientific interest on account of its archaeological research potential. It has considerable potential to demonstrate the development of the estate from the 1800s to the presentNational Trust, 2000 Glenfield Farm was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. The song is sung by the character Eliza Hamilton, originally performed by Phillipa Soo. Background As Ron Chernow describes in his biography Alexander Hamilton, for which the show was based, \\"Eliza Hamilton was a modest, self-effacing woman who apparently destroyed her own letters and tried to expunge her presence from the history books.\\" The song draws on Lin-Manuel Miranda's interpretation of Chernow's assumption that Eliza destroyed some of her correspondence with her husband. Synopsis \\"Burn\\" comes just after Alexander Hamilton, hoping to salvage his professional legacy, admits to his extramarital affair in a public pamphlet. Eliza finds herself as collateral damage in the matter, feeling shattered and betrayed by the revelation. The heartbreak and public humiliation drive her to take control of the story by burning the love letters Hamilton wrote to her. Analysis Several critics pointed out the apparent meta-references in some of the song's lyrics. Writing for The New Yorker, Michael Shulman noted that, \\"Surely Miranda is poking fun at his own lack of primary sources when it came to dramatizing this moment in the Hamiltons' marriage. But in embracing the enigma the song points to the larger problem of women's history: the public records are thinner, the milieu is mostly domestic, and there's more need for speculation. What was Eliza really thinking? Was burning her letters the only act of personal agency she had left?\\" HuffPosts Elizabeth Logan added that, \\"It's telling that Eliza refers again and again to Angelica's view on the crisis [of Hamilton's cheating]. This marriage was never just the two of them.\\" Critical reception The song received critical acclaim, particularly for Soo's performance. Nora Dominick of Entertainment Monthly said that, \\"the track makes a lasting impact on the Hamilton album as a whole\\" and that it \\"is sure to become another classic number from Hamilton, and it's all thanks to Soo and her strong, heartbreaking portrayal of Eliza.\\" Writing for The Young Folks, Matt Rice ranked the song #13 out of the album's 46 songs. The Odyssey's Bayleigh Reeves ranked the song #8, and BuzzFeed listed it as #3. Mixtape version \\"Burn\\" is a song from The Hamilton Mixtape performed by Andra Day. =Background= At the time of recording, Day had not yet seen the musical on Broadway, but was familiar with the story. \\"I was actually obsessed with Alexander Hamilton in school,\\" she said. She chose to cover \\"Burn\\" after being drawn to the \\"raw, fiery, painful emotion\\" of Eliza in the song. \\"I already had such an empathy for her. Even before the show came out, I was like, 'You know what? The guy's a dirtbag.'\\" =Music video= A music video for the song was released on August 29, 2018. The video was directed by Aurora Guerrero. Guerrero was recommended to Miranda by famed director Ava DuVernay after Miranda reached out to DuVernay to connect him with a director that he did not already know. Miranda later commented that he was \\"crazy about\\" the video that Guerrero put together. =Critical reception= Marissa Martinelli of Slate ranked the song #4 out of the album's 23 songs. She called Day's version \\"devastating\\" and concluded that, \\"Compositionally, this cover plays it safe, but Day brings such rage and heartbreak to the song that it‚Äôs more than just a retread.\\" Hamildrop version \\"First Burn\\" is the fifth promotional single of the Hamildrops collection. The song was released on April 30, 2018 and features five actress who had played Eliza Hamilton at notable productions of the musical: Arianna Afsar (original Chicago company), Julia Harriman (first national tour), Shoba Narayan (original second national tour company), Rachelle Ann Go (original West End company) and Lexi Lawson (Broadway). =Background= The song is the first draft of \\"Burn\\" written by Miranda. Discussing its function within the musical and how the song evolved, Miranda said that, \\"In the final 'Burn' [Eliza] has agency, and makes a decision to destroy Hamilton‚Äôs best self. In this draft she‚Äôs angrier, but it‚Äôs entirely reactive.\\" He also stated that the draft version worked \\"as a song but not as a scene\\" due to the lack of dramatic tension from Eliza burning the letters right from the start, as well as certain lyrics giving away the last song in the show, diminishing it.

Central European University Press, 2018, , pp. 135‚Äì147.  Emergence and development  Georgi Rakovski, one of the first Bulgarian national activists, coined in 1860s the theory, to that the Bulgarians were an autochthonous population on the Balkans, known to the ancient writers as Thracians.Dessislava Lilova, The homeland as terra incognita: geography and Bulgarian national identity, 1830s‚Äì1870s in The Balkans as Europe, 1821‚Äì1914, Volume 21 of Rochester studies in East and Central Europe with Timothy Snyder and Katherine Younger as ed., Boydell & Brewer, 2018, , pp. 31‚Äì54. This historiographical concept was exposed scientific for the first time in 1910 in the book \\"The Origin of the Bulgarians and the beginning of the Bulgarian state and the Bulgarian church\\" by Gancho Tzenov. Fundamental tenet of the autochthonous theory is that the Bulgars, that were actually Bulgarians are not settlers in Europe, but people who have inhabited the Balkans since antiquity. That is, they as a people, although had different names in different historical epochs, are actually direct descendants of indigenous tribes as Thracians, Illyrians, Macedones, Getae etc., who lived on the same territory.Maciej Gorny, War on Paper? Physical Anthropology in the Service of States and Nations, p. 163, in Legacies of Violence: Eastern Europe‚Äôs First World War, Volume 3 Europas Osten im 20. Jahrhundert with Jochen B√∂hler, Wlodzimierz Borodziej and Joachim von Puttkamer as ed. Walter de Gruyter, 2014, , pp. 131‚Äì168. This theory, though denied and rejected as a marginal one, has its supporters and theorists in its various variations today as Georgi Rakovski and Gancho Tsenov have been rediscovered. Their theories have been updated as an alternative to the accepted migration theories. One of them establishes a complete continuity between ancient Balkan populations and modern Bulgarians. Thracians are considered simply ancestors of the modern Bulgarians and their continuity is projected to the prehistoric times. Generally, proponents of Thracomania assume that the Thracians and Bulgarians are the same people, and that therefore the descended from the Thracians must be in fact Bulgarians.Ivan Marinov and Nicolas Zorzin, Thracology and Nationalism in Bulgaria. Deconstructing Contemporaneous Historical and Archaeological Representations. EX NOVO. Journal of Archaeology, Volume 2, December 2017, ISSN 2531-8810, pp. 85‚Äì110.

History  In 1922, the architect of the Nebraska State Capitol, Bertram Goodhue, proposed a seven-block-long avenue to create a more formal approach to the Capitol's north entrance. Fifteen years later in 1937, the city and state designated a 120-foot-wide right of way from the Capitol to the University of Nebraska - Lincoln campus and created a commission to begin work on the Mall. The project was completed in 1967 to commemorate the centennial of Nebraska's statehood. From 1967 to 2009, the Mall remained largely unchanged and fell into disrepair. In order to enhance the visual beauty, ease of pedestrian use, and accessibility of the space, the Lincoln Parks Foundation began raising money to renovate Centennial Mall in 2009. Through both public and private funding, the project was completed by Clark Enersen Partners in 2016.  Description  Following the $19.6 million renovation completed in 2016, Centennial Mall features many interactive and educational opportunities, including plaques with QR codes which can be scanned to learn more about industries, important figures, and historical sites. The space was divided into three zones, each exploring a different theme related to Nebraska: Civic, Community, and Campus. = Civic Zone = This area of Centennial Mall explores the themes of \\"We the People\\" and \\"Our Home Nebraska.\\" \\"We the People,\\" which extends from \\"K\\" to \\"L\\" streets is a large, formal plaza with elements that celebrate the democratic process, watchful citizens, and state leaders. \\"Our Home Nebraska\\" focuses on the geographic features, natural resources, and stewardship of the land of Nebraska. The major rivers and ecoregions of the state are represented through a large outline of the state in the pavement. = Community Zone = The three central blocks of Centennial Mall, which stretch from \\"M\\" to \\"P\\" streets are open to automobile traffic and focus on the theme \\"Mosaic of Nebraskans.\\" The sidewalks in this area have been widened to allow donors to inscribe paving stones with the names of individuals, families, communities, and organizations from Nebraska. = Campus Zone = The final two blocks of Centennial Mall, \\"P\\" to \\"R\\" streets, reflect the importance of the University of Nebraska in shaping both Lincoln and Nebraska as a whole. This space celebrates innovators, educators, and artists from Nebraska. Housed between the College of Journalism and Mass Communications and the Lincoln Children's Museum, this area features an art alcove, water features, and an amphitheater to celebrate and encourage creativity and artistic expression. = Standing Bear Statue = In 2017, a ten-foot-tall statue honoring Chief Standing Bear of the Ponca Tribe was unveiled on Centennial Mall in the Campus Zone. The bronze Standing Bear statue, created by Ben Victor, references the \\"Standing Lincoln\\" statue memorializing Abraham Lincoln which stands in front of the Nebraska State Capitol building. The unveiling ceremony featured dancers from the Winnebago Tribe, a dedication by mayor Chris Beutler, a reception following the event, and a sale of the artist's maquettes of the statue to benefit a Native American scholarship fund.

POR is a 2-flavin protein that is responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADPH to all 50 microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. This includes the steroidogenic enzymes CYP17A1 (17Œ±-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase), CYP19A1 (aromatase), and CYP21A2 (21-hydroxylase); CYP26B1 (metabolizes retinoic acid); and the hepatic drug-metabolizing CYP450 enzymes (e.g., CYP3A4), among many other CYP450 enzymes. Symptoms of severe forms of PORD include ambiguous genitalia in males and females, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cortisol deficiency, and Antley‚ÄìBixler skeletal malformation syndrome (ABS), while symptoms of mild forms include polycystic ovary syndrome in women and hypogonadism in men. Maternal virilization also occurs in severe forms, due to aromatase deficiency in the placenta. Virilization of female infants in PORD may also be caused by alternative biosynthesis of 5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone via the so-called \\"androgen backdoor pathway\\". The ABS component of severe forms of PORD is probably caused by CYP26B1 deficiency, which results in retinoic acid excess and defects during skeletal embryogenesis.

Fossils from this species were discovered in Dikika, Lower Awash Valley in Ethiopia. These fossils were found in the lower basal member of the Hadar Formation, which means they existed more than 3.42 million years ago but the estimated age of the fossils is greater than 3.4 million years old and likely to be closer to 4 million years old. In comparison to the other species in the genus Enhydriodon, E. dikikae is one of the youngest. It is suggested that E. dikikae weighed up to 200 kilograms and grew up to 2 meters in length. The fossils evidence suggests that the E. dikikae was a giant semiaquatic otter and had a jaw structure that suggests it fed on hard foods but this is still undetermined. While related species have also been found in Europe and Asia, the differences in size and dental structures differentiate E. dikikae from its relatives.  Taxonomy  Enhydriodon dikikae belongs to the order Carnivora, superfamily Musteloidea, family Mustelidae and subfamily Lutrinae. The closest living relatives to this species are the modern otters. Other related animals in the Musteloidea superfamily are from the family, Procyonidae to which animals like racoons, olingos and coatis belong to. There is some debate over whether E. dikikae should belong to the genus Sivaonyx however at this point, it is still classified as being in the genus Enhydriodon.  Description  Fossils of a partial skull which included a snout, orbit, parts of the lower jaw and most of the teeth that belonged to E. dikikae. According to these fossils, E. dikikae was similar in size to a bear but resembled the modern otter. It is estimated to have weighed 100‚Äì200 kg and to be over 2m in body length. The fossils found in Ethiopia suggest that the species had a large skull, approximately 25 cm with a short, non-prognathic snout. The dental arch was broad, with long, strong canines grown laterally on the maxilla and large premolars. The limb-bone fossils measured up to 27 cm in length. Enhydriodon dikikae differs from other species in the genus Enhydriodon in its loss of frontal premolars and a divided lower molar, as well as its overall size. Most of the relatives of E. dikikae are smaller in size. Unlike its Indian relative, Enhydriodon falconeri in the larger points in the crown of its teeth. The dental structures of E. dikikae also differ from its relatives Enhydriodon ekecaman from Kenya, Enhydriodon hendeyi from South Africa, and the Enhydriodon africanus from Namibia. The E. dikikae is also generally larger in size than the other Enhydriodon species. In comparison to the other Enhydriodon species, E. dikikae is relatively young. The fossils of E. dikikae are likely to be close to 4 million years old, which falls into the mid- Pliocene epoch. While Enhydriodon sivalensis is estimated to have existed in the late Pliocene which is later than E. dikikae, the rest of the Enhydriodon species existed in the Early Pliocene, with the earliest fossils of Enhydriodon campanii from Italy and Enhydriodon lluecai from Spain dating back to the Late Miocene.  Paleoecology  The E. dikikae fossils were found in Dikika, Lower Awash, Ethiopia along with aquatic and terrestrial species from that epoch. Carbon and oxygen isotopes of tooth fossils from various other species that existed during the same time as E. dikikae were used to determine the habitat and food resources available in Pliocene Dikika. The isotopic analyses suggested that the landscape of Dikika during this part of the Pliocene was between grassy woodland and open grassland so, habitat resources consisted mostly of woodlands and shrublands, with a shift towards open and arid environments. The oxygen isotopes analysis also indicated that the area was in close proximity to a body of water, most likely a freshwater swamp or shallow lake and that there were various drinking water resources. Studies suggest that there was a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperatures during the Pliocene and the abundance of grassy habitat allowed the fauna to be dominated by terrestrial animals. However, fossils found in the same research site as E. dikikae and at the same stratigraphical level included aquatic species like fish, crocodiles, and hippopotamuses as well as terrestrial species. Other fossil evidence suggests that E. dikikae coexisted with more than one other Mustelidae species such as the smaller E. ekecaman and Torolutra. It is likely that the difference in size between these species forced them to prey on animals of different sizes and therefore they were not in competition with each other. There is no evidence to explain why E. dikikae went extinct after the Pliocene epoch. However, while presenting his findings in New York, Lars Werdelin suggested that the emergence of early hominins may have been a possible cause for the extinction of the large carnivores that existed at the time due to indirect competition. He suggests that hominins may have competed with these animals for habitats, forcing a change in some behaviours like predation behaviours, and subsequently the effect of the early hominins may have forced these carnivores into extinction.  Paleobiology  The fossils of E. dikikae had thinner limb bones than aquatic species but weaker than fully terrestrial predators, suggesting aquatic and non-aquatic adaptations. It is likely that the species spent more time on land than in the water unlike their later relative, E. sivalensis that were mostly aquatic and lived under boulders or rocks, in dens or under tree trunks along the banks of streams or lakes. The structure of the jaw and teeth of E. dikikae were used to determine the possible diet of the species. The large teeth along the cheekbone of the skull indicates that their diet may have consisted of hard food. This is supported by the large size of the crushing parts of the teeth that would have been used to break through their hard food. Due to the large size of E. dikikae, it is unlikely that it would have been able to catch fast- moving prey like fish, however catfish were found in shallow waters during the same period of time and the purpose of the jaw structure could be for crushing the skull of the catfish to prevent E. dikikae from getting hurt. A study suggests that, like their relative species, E. falconeri and E. sivalensis, E. dikikae may have fed on bivalves because of a common incisor arch in the three species which would have been used to crush the shells of the bivalves.

The temple is of a circular type, formed of a central stupa surrounded by a circular colonnade and an enclosing wall. It was built during the time of Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE, and near it were found two of Ashoka's Minor Rock Edicts, the Bairat and the Calcutta-Bairat Minor Rock Edicts.Le Huu Phuoc, 2010, p.233-237 The temple is an important marker of the architecture of India. A rare circular stand-alone temple Early Chaitya halls are known from the 3rd century BCE. They generally followed a circular or apsidal plan, and were either rock-cut or freestanding. Temples ‚Äîbuilt on elliptical, circular, quadrilateral, or apsidal plans‚Äî were initially constructed using brick and timber.Chandra (2008) Some temples of timber with wattle-and-daub may have preceded them, but none remain to this day. Today, only the foundation of the temple remains. The circular temple was located inside a rectangular enclosure wall, and had an outer diameter of 5.6 meters. It was built around a small stupa at the centre, with a diameter of 1.6 meters. There was also an internal circle of 26 wooden octagonal columns surrounding the stupa. The layout created two pradaksina circular paths for devotional deambulation. The global shape of the temple has been inferred from more or less contemporary reliefs of such buildings from Bharhut, or from rock-cut temples at Kondivite, Tulja Caves or Guntupalli Caves. It has been suggested that this circular design with columns was derived from the similar design of the Greek Tholos. However local circular hut designs are a more probable source of inspiration.

The inscription was found on a rock on the platform between the Bairat Temple and the huge cannon-shaped rock in front of it. The word \\"Buddha\\" in the Bairat Edict. Brahmi script. A Minor Rock Edict of Ashoka (the unique Minor Rock Edict No.3) was found in close proximity to the Temple: the Bairat-Calcutta Edict, also called the Bhabru Edict, from the name of a nearby village. Dating to circa 250 BCE, the edict was found just in front of the remains of the Bairat Temple, on the lower platform located between the temple and the cannon-shaped large rock, by Major Burt in 1840 ().\\"According to Cunningham this is probably the same inscription of Ashoka which Major Burt found in 1840 on a hill at Bairat.\\" in The presence of this inscription, its date and its Buddhist content, help date the temple with a high level of certainty, as well as confirm its Buddhist affiliation. The Edict, relocated since the 19th century to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta (hence the name \\"Calcutta-Bairat Edict)\\", is the only one of its kind, describing Buddhist scriptures recommended by Ashoka for study. It reads: This edict was the basis for the efforts at deciphering Brahmi, led by James Prinsep in 1837.Proceedings of the Meetings of the Session, Volume 24, Indian Historical Records Commission, 1948 \\"the discovery at Bairat of the Asokan inscription which, in the hands of James Prinsep, became the key for unravelling and deciphering the edicts of King Piyadasi\\" A commemorative plaque is visible at the Asiatic Society. Other circular temples Tall circular Buddhist temple, early 1st Century CE, Mathura Museum. Some of the earliest free-standing temples may have been of a circular type. Ashoka also built the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya circa 250 BCE, also a circular structure, in order to protect the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha had found enlightenment. Representations of this early temple structure are found on a 100 BCE relief sculpted on the railing of the stupa at BhƒÅrhut, as well as in Sanchi.\\"Sowing the Seeds of the Lotus: A Journey to the Great Pilgrimage Sites of Buddhism, Part I\\" by John C.

Apsidal temples Another early free- standing temple in India, this time apsidal in shape, appears to be Temple 40 at Sanchi, which is also dated to the 3rd century BCE.Buddhist Architecture, Lee Huu Phuoc, Grafikol 2010, p.147 It was an apsidal temple built of timber on top of a high rectangular stone platform, 26.52x14x3.35 metres, with two flights of stairs to the east and the west. The temple was burnt down sometime in the 2nd century BCE. This type of apsidal structure was also adopted for most of the cave temple (Chaitya-grihas), as in the 3rd century BCE Barabar Caves and most caves thereafter, with side, and then frontal, entrances. A freestanding apsidal temple remains to this day, although in a modified form, in the Trivikrama Temple in Ter, Maharashtra.

In the RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a television or computer screen, azure is created by adding a little green light to blue light. The complementary color of azure is orange. In the X11 color system which became a standard for early web colors, azure is depicted as a pale cyan or white cyan. Distinction between indigo, azure and cyan All of the colors shown below in the section variations of azure are referenced as having a hue code of between 195 and 225 (the hue code is the h code in the HSV color space), signifying that these colors are tones of azure.

The author Sydney Loch had served in the First A.I.F. in the Gallipoli Campaign and the original manuscript was written as an autobiography of this service. By the time the manuscript was complete, Sydney had been returned wounded and sick to Australia and was still in active service. With wartime censorship in effect in Australia, his publisher Henry Champion advised that it should be edited and published as a novel to pass the censor. This was done and the first edition of 2,000 copies was well received and sold out quickly. Many names were changed with some very thinly disguised pseudonyms such as Capt. Carrot in place of Capt. Charles Bean. Sydney also used a pen name, Sydney De Loghe. The truthful and graphic portrayal of conditions at Gallipoli and their effects on the servicemen there made the book notable. Later editions A second edition was printed shortly after the first but this time with a note in the cover that stated \\"This book, Written in Australia, Egypt and Gallipoli, Is true\\".

Although he served in an administrative and military capacity, he was also a patron of art, literature and public works. He, together with his brother TejapƒÅla, assisted in the restoration of peace in the kingdom, and served in a number of campaigns against LƒÅ·π≠a, Godraha, Kutch and the Delhi Sultanate. The brothers were instrumental in the construction of the Luniga-vasahi temple on Mount Abu and the Vastupala-vihara on Girnar. Ancestry and family Vastupala and his brother Tejapala were born to a Pragavata, or Porwad as they are known today, Jain family in Anahilavada Patan (modern day Patan, Gujarat). Vijayasenasuri, a Jain monk of Nagendra Gachchha, was their clan guru. Extensive information on their ancestry has been drawn from literary works and inscriptions: in Naranarayan- ananda, Vastupala referred to Chandapa as his ancestor and this descent has been expanded upon in Prabandha-kosha and Puratana-prabandha-sangraha. Chandapa was a minister, probably in the Chaulukya court, where his son Chandaprasada also served as a minister. Jaishree, Chandaprasada's wife, bore him two sons, Sura and Soma, who became a jewel keeper to the Chaulukya ruler, Jayasimha Siddharaja. Soma's wife, Sita, bore him one son, Ashwaraja (or Asharaja). Later in life, Ashwaraja became a minister and married Kumaradevi, a daughter of Abhu, a Pragvata vanika and a dandapati (commander-in-chief) by profession. Kumaradevi was apparently a widow when she married Ashwaraja; however, this has been disputed. The couple had eleven children ‚Äî seven daughters: Jalhu (or Bhau or Jalu), Mau, Sau, Dhanadevi, Sohaga, Vaijuka (or Tejuka) and Padmaladevi; and four sons: Luniga, Malladeva, Vastupala and Tejapala. Luniga died in childhood while Malladeva died after fathering a son, Purnasimha. Early life Very little is known about the early life of Vastupala or his brother. Even less is known about Vastupala's date of birth, although the VasantavilƒÅsa mentions 1163 CE as the year of birth. An undated inscription (now housed in the Watson Museum, Rajkot) mentions that the brothers made a pilgrimage to Mount Shatrunjaya with their father A≈õvarƒÅjƒÅ in VS 1249 (1193 CE), presumably during their childhood. They lived in Sumhalaka, a town granted to their father as a reward for his service to the king of Chaulukya. Their father visited many pilgrim sites with their mother KumƒÅradevƒ´ and built several public utilities, such as lakes, tanks, wells, and temples. After the death of their father, they lived in Mandali or Mandalika (modern day Mandal) with their mother, probably until her death. Vastupala was married to Lalita and Vayajalladevi (or Sokhuka or Saukhyalata). Tejapala was married to Anupama and Suhavadevi (also spelled Suhadadevi). Anupama was a daughter of Dharaniga, a counselor to the brothers, and his wife Tribhuvanadevi. Career According to Kirti-kaumudi, the Vasanta-vilasa, the Prabandha-kosha, and the Prabandha-chintamani, the brothers travelled to the Vaghela capital at Dhavalakka (modern day Dholka). There, they were introduced by Someshwara to king Viradhavala who subsequently appointed them. Other sources, such as the Sukrita-sankirtana, Vastupala-Tejapala-Prashsti and Sukrita-kirti-kallolini, state that the brothers served the Chaulukya king Bhima II who dispatched them to Viradhavala. This is confirmed by writings by Vastupala himself, who wrote in the Naranarayan-ananda that he was in the service of Bhima II prior to his departure for Dhavalakka. The date when he began his service in the Chaulukya court is not known but they were certainly appointed at Dhavalakka in VS 1276 (1220 CE). Vastupala and Tejapala traveled to Dhavalakka at a time when they were in such poverty that their other brother, Luniga, was unable to donate an image of Jina to the Vimala-vasahi temple on Mount Abu before his death. Vastupala and Tejapala are said to have miraculously acquired wealth through the blessings of Shrimata, the patron deity of Abu and using this wealth, they commissioned a temple, Luniga-vasahi, dedicated to Luniga. =Administrative career= Vastupala was made a governor of Sthambhatirtha (now Khambhat), then an important port town, while Tejapala was made a minister at Dhavalakka. During his tenure, he enacted reforms to the administration and increased state revenue. He also instituted measures against corruption and piracy. The Vastupala-charita mentions punishments being meted out to a wealthy Muslim trader from Stambhatirtha, various corrupt officials, citizens, and village headmen. Particular examples include the fining of the village heads of around five hundred villages in the region for irregularities, as well as the administrators of Vardhamanapur (modern day Wadhwan) and Gohilavati. =Military career= The Prabandhas mention that Vastupala participated in 63 battles, although few of these are discussed. They mention his involvement in the military activities of Viradhavala, and state that he captured Vamanasthali (modern day Vanthali) from Samgana and Chamunda, brothers of Viradhavala's wife Jayataladevi. The brothers also attacked Bhadreshwar, ruled by Bhimasimha of the Pratihara clan, in Kutch but were unsuccessful and ultimately concluded a peace treaty with him. Vastupala and Viradhavala were defeated by the three warriors from Marwar; Samantapala, Anandapala and Trilokasimha; who had supported Bhimasimha. Tejapala commanded an army against Ghughula, a chief of Godraha (modern day Godhra), and successfully captured him. Tejapala had him imprisoned within a wooden cage until he committed suicide by biting his tongue. Sadik, a Muslim merchant, rejected the authority of Vastupala and induced Sankha (Sangramsimha), a ruler of Lata (now South Gujarat) to attack Stambhatirtha. Vastupala suffered a number of early defeats but he later received support from Mahechaka (although the Prabandha-chintamani states that it was Lunapala). After a fierce battle at Vatakupa near Stambhatirtha, Shankha retreated or was killed. Sadik was captured and put to death. Viradhavala ordered the confiscation his property, absorbing it into the state treasury. Vastupala received some part of his wealth. The people of Stambhatirtha celebrated the victory by organising a festival in the temple of Goddess Ekallavira which lay outside the town. Vastupala attended the festival, and paid the homage to the goddess. The battle must have fought before he handed over administration of Stambhatirtha to his son, Jaitrasimha or Jayantastmha, in VS 1279 (1223 CE). Harihara's Sankha-Parabhava-Vyayoga is a historical play dramatizing this battle. During the reign of Viradhavala, the Sultan of Delhi Mojdin attacked Gurjaradesa, an event that was dramatised in Hammira-mada-mardana, a Sanskrit play by Jaysimha Suri. The Prabandhka-kosha describes the Delhi army being forced to retreat after being encircled by Dharavarsha of Chandravati from the north, and Vastupala from the south, leaving the army trapped in a mountain pass near Arbuda (modern day Mount Abu). In another action against the Delhi Sultanate, Vastupala secretly hired pirates to rob the mother of the Sultan when she was to board a ship, possibly at Stambhatirtha, taking her on a pilgrimage to Mecca. The captain of the ship approached Vastupala who received the Sultan's mother with respect and returned the booty. Upon her return from Mecca, she presented Vastupala to the Sultan, who began friendly relations with Viradhavala. Vastupala was received with honour by Viradhavala for successfully safeguarding his realm from the predations of the Delhi Sultanate. Copied manuscripts of Hammira-mada-mardana are dated to around 1230 CE (VS 1286) and Vastupala had begun his career in 1220 CE (VS 1276) so this event is likely to have occurred between these two dates. These manuscripts are preserved in Jain library of Jaisalmer. Death Vastupala died in 1240 CE (VS 1296), not long after Viradhavala, who died in 1238 CE and was succeeded by his younger brother Visaladeva. The date of Vastupala's death is mentioned by his contemporary, Balachandra, who wrote in Vasanta-vilasa that his death fell on the fifth day of the bright half of Magha month VS 1296, corresponding to 1 January 1240 CE. The year VS 1296 is also mentioned in a palm leaf manuscript. However, Prabandha-kosha and Vastupala-charita both note VS 1298 (1242 CE) as the year of his death. The Abu inscription, dated to the third day of the bright of Vaishakha month VS 1296 (12 April 1240 CE), mentions Tejapala as a Mahamatya (minister), a position he could only have ascended to following the death of Vastupala, so 1240 CE is considered as a true date of his death. The Prabandhas mention that he died due to fever in a village Arkapalita (now Ankevalia in Gujarat), on his last pilgrimage to Mount Shatrunjaya, but this is not mentioned in Vasanta-vilasa. The Vividha-tirtha- kalpa and Prabandha-kosha mention that Vastupala lost his ministerial authority to Nagara Brahmin Nagada. Two different stories are mentioned: One stating that Visaladeva was angered because Vastupala had declared the punishment to his maternal uncle for insulting a Jain monk. Another states that Visaladeva decided to punish Vastupala when he found that some of state revenues were used for the temple constructions. In the both stories, Someshwara saved Vastupala from punishment. This is counter to other sources that mention Visaladeva being dissatisfied with Vastupala but did not make any mention of a loss of ministerial authority. The Abu inscription, dated to the 3rd day of the bright half of the Magha month VS 1296 (26 April 1240 CE), suggests that Tejapala succeeded him as minister so the king must not have removed him as a minister. Tejapala's son Lunasimha is mentioned as a governor of Bhrigukachcha (modern day Bharuch) in a colophon of a palm-leaf manuscript dated VS 1296 (1242 CE). Tejapala is mentioned as a minister (mahamatya) in a manuscript of Acharanga-sutra dated to VS 1303 (1247 CE). The Vastupala- charita mentions that Tejapala died ten years after the death of Vastupala, so he may have died in VS 1306 (1250 CE), VS 1308 (1252 CE) or VS 1304 (1248 CE). Nagada is first mentioned as a minister in VS 1310 (1254 CE) so Tejapala must have died between 1247 CE and 1254 CE. Cultural activities =Pilgrimages= left Vastupala made thirteen pilgrimages to Mount Shatrunjaya and Girnar. In addition to his childhood visits with his father in 1193 CE and 1194 CE, he led five annual sanghas (pilgrim caravans) to Shatrunjaya and Girnar between 1221 and 1237 CE as well as annual pilgrimages with his family to Shatrunjaya between 1227 and 1233 CE. His pilgrimage in 1221 CE is mentioned repeatedly in Girnar inscriptions and in contemporary works such as the Kirti-kaumudi, Sukrita-sankirtana and Dharmabhyudaya. He died during his 1240 CE pilgrimage, which is described in Vasanta-vilasa. =Construction activities= Luniga-vasahi temple on Mount Abu Vastupala- Vihara on Girnar hill Vastupala-Vihara in 1876 Vastupala was a philanthropist and commissioned the construction of numerous monuments and public utilities such as temples, rest-houses, wells, hospitals and tanks. Contemporary sources, such as Sukrita-sankirtana, mention about fifty construction works. The number of his works increased considerably in later works of Rajashekhara Suri, Jinaharsha and Jinaprabha, although the number maybe exaggerated. Rajashekhara Suri mentioned that his charity extended from Shri Shaila in the south to Kedara in the north and Prabhasa in the west to Banaras in the east. Apart from building numerous Jain temples, he also built Brahmashalas, Mathas, Shiva temples as well as mosques. More than fifty temples were commissioned by Vastupala and Tejapala in addition to a large number of renovations and image installations. Vastupala commissioned the construction of Indra-mandapa and six other temples on Shatrunjaya hill, the Adinatha temple at Dholka, Ashtapada-prasada at Prabhas, Vastupala-vihara and Parshwanatha temple on Girnar. The Girnar temples were built in 1232 CE. His brother, Tejapala, commissioned the construction of Asharaja-vihara at Tejalapur, Patan and Junagadh in memory of his father. He also commissioned the Neminath Temple at Dholka, Adinath Temple at Prabhas, as well as temples at Tharad, Karnavati, Godhra, Shatrunjaya, Girnar, Pavagadh, Navsari among others. In memory of his mother Kumaradevi, he had temples built at Khambhat and Dabhoi. Vastupala built a temple dedicated to Mahavira, an Upashraya (rest-rooms for monks) and excavated a tank at Padaliptapura (modern day Palitana). He also built large tanks at Arakapalita and Suryapura, two statues at the temple dedicated to Mahavira at Modhera, and Shakunika-vihara at Bharuch. The Luniga-vasahi temple dedicated to Neminatha was built on Mount Abu by Tejapala in memory of his elder brother Luniga in 1231 CE. There are about thirty inscriptions mentioning additions to the temples and his family members. The Prabandhas state that the Luniga-vasahi cost twelve crores and fifty-three lakhs while the Girnar temples cost eighteen crores and ninety-six lakhs, although these figures may be an exaggerated. Of the temples built by the brothers, only a few survive such as Vastupala-vihara at Girnar (1231 CE), Neminath Temple at Abu and the temple at Prabhas. Born into an aristocratic family, the brothers were quite wealthy and were patrons of many public works. The Prabandhas contain numerous stories of their wealth, some of which read like folktales while others are contemporaneous accounts. One account tells of the brothers seeking to bury part of their wealth, worth one lakh, near the village of Hadalaka (modern Hadala near Dhandhuka). However, upon excavation, they discovered a large treasure. Anupama, wife of Tejapala, counselled Vastupala to keep it on the peaks of the mountains so it may not fall in the hands of others, as it fell to theirs. The brothers had the Jain temples of Girnar and Mount Abu built and led pilgrimages there. Her advice proved sound and these are the only surviving public works built by the brothers. =Patronage= Vastupala was a patron to many poets and scholars, earning him nickname Laghu Bhojaraja or Junior Bhoja. His patronage of poetry is described in the Prabandha-kosha, Vastupala-charita, Puratana-prabandha-samgraha and Upadesha-tarangini. He was a tolerant of other faiths which led him to be patron to Jain as well as non-Jain poets and scholars as well, including Someshwara, Harihara, Arisimha and Nanaka. He also made a donation of 10000 drammas (coins) to the Shiva temple of Prabhas. Many literary works were commissioned at his request such as the Katha-ratnakara of Narachandra Suri and the Alankara-mahodadhi of Narendraprabha Suri. He had made a copy of Dharmabhyudaya Mahakavya of Udayaprabha Suri, a pupil of Vijayasena Suri. This copied manuscript, dated VS 1290 (1234 CE), has been stored in the Jain library of Khambhat. =Literary works= He was an expert poet having studied Nyaya, Vyakarana (grammar) and Sahitya (literature), as well as Jain philosophy under Narachandra, and was eulogised in the works of others. He had received titles of 'Kavi-kunjara', 'Saraswati-kantha-bharana' (Ornament of the goddess of knowledge Saraswati's neck), 'Kavi-chakravarti' (universal king of poetry) and 'Kurchala-saraswati' (Saraswati with a beard) for his literary capabilities. Harihara, Someshwara and other poets gave him a poetic name, Vasantapala, and Balachandra named his biographical work, Vasanta-vilasa. Vastuapala wrote Naranarayan-ananda and noted in its conclusion that his first poem was a hymn praising Adinatha in the temple on the Shatrunjaya hills. This hymn is Adinatha Stotra, or Ishwara-manoratha-maya Stotra, and consists of twelve verses. Another of his Stotra, Nemistava, contains ten verses, eight dedicated to Neminatha and two to himself. Ambika Stotra is dedicated to Ambika, the presiding goddess of Neminatha and the family goddess of Pragavata, his clan. It has ten verses, eight of which praise Ambika, the ninth contains blessings for the devotee and the tenth is reserved for himself. He wrote a short ten verse devotional, Aradhana, which would be his last composition. Prabandha-kosha notes that the first verse of it, \\"Na Kritam Sukritam Kinchit\\", was spoken by him on his death-bed. Aradhana is also mentioned in the Puratana-prabandha-samgraha and the Prabandha-chintamani. Vastupala was considered an expert in composing Sanskrit suktis (stray poetry), drawing praise from Someshwara and Udayaprabha. A number of his works appear in anthologies written by others. Sukti-muktavali, a 13th-century anthology commissioned by the Yadava general Jalhana, contains four of his verses as does the Sharngadhara-paddhati written by Sharangdhara of Shakambhari. His Naranarayan-ananda is a long poem describing the friendship between Krishna and Arjuna, their walk and talks in the gardens of Raivataka (Girnar), and the later abduction of Krishna's sister Subhadra by Arjuna. The subject is taken from Vanaparva of Mahabharata. It consists of 16 cantos with 794 verses. He mentioned his pilgrimages at the end of the poem so it must have been written after 1221 CE, the year of his first major pilgrimage. Parts of the poem were quoted by others, such as Kavya-kalpalata of Amarachandra, who drew one verse, and Jalhana who included the sixth verse from the first canto in his Sukti-muktavali. Sources of information A large number of literary sources and inscriptions give information on the life and works of Vastupala and his brother Tejapala. =Literary sources= Contemporary literary sources The last canto of Naranarayan-ananda, written by Vastupala himself, gives some information on him and his family. Other biographical works, such as Kirti-kaumudi and Surathotsava, both written by Someshwara, and Sukrita-sankirtana, by Arisimha, were written during Vastupula's lifetime while Balachandra's Vasanta-vilasa was written soon after his death. Surathotsava is a mythological historical allegory but it does give information on the Chaulukya king Bhima II, whom Vastupala first served; Dharmabhyudaya mentions his pilgrimages; and Jayasimha's play Hammira-mada- mardana (1220‚Äì1230 CE) discusses his military career and his strategy in dealing with the invasion from Delhi. The Apabhramsa poems ‚Äì Revanatagiri Rasu by Vijayasena and Abu Rasa (1233 CE) by Pahlanputra ‚Äì mention his pilgrimage to Girnar and the construction of the temple on Mount Abu respectively. Jinabhadra's Prabandhavali, the oldest prabandha, speaks of events during Vastupala's life and has helped solve chronological inconsistencies. Narendraprabha's Vastupala-prashasti, Narachandra's Vastupala-prashasti, and Udayaprabha's Vastupala-stuti mention his activities. Later literary sources Merutunga's Prabandha-Chintamani (1305 CE); Rajashekhara's Prabandha-kosha (1349 CE); and Puratana-prabandha-sangraha, a collection of prabandhas from 13th to 15th century; are important sources. Jinaprabha's Vividha-tirtha-kalpa (1333 CE) is also noteworthy. Jinaharsha's Vastupala- charita is an authentic biography of Vastupala with very few exaggerations. Ratnamandiragani's Upadesha-tarangini (1461 CE), Subhashilagani's Prabandha- panchasati / Kathakosha (1453 CE), and Somadharma's Upadesha-saptati (1447 CE) note the cultural activities of Vastupala. Old Gujarati poems include Vastupla-Tejapala-Rasa and other Rasas by Hiranada (1428 CE), Lakshmisagara (after 1452 CE), Parshwachandra (1541 CE), Samayasundara (1626 CE), and Meruvijaya (1665 CE). =Epigraphic sources= { \\"type\\": \\"FeatureCollection\\", \\"features\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Abu\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.7156274, 24.5925909 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker- symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Dabhoi\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 73.4121277, 22.1323391 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Girnar\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 70.5502916, 21.5178869 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Khambhat (Cambay)\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.6189845, 22.3180817 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Patan\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.1266255, 23.8493246 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Sherisa\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.470142734892, 23.199038085351 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Ganesar\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.415139183431, 22.590561264422 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Taranga hill\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.75607466654, 23.965441571049 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Nagara\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\" }, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.626898102608, 22.359706598755 ] } }, { \\"type\\": \\"Feature\\", \\"properties\\": { \\"marker-symbol\\": \\"monument\\", \\"title\\": \\"Nava Sanghpur\\", \\"description\\": \\"\\"}, \\"geometry\\": { \\"type\\": \\"Point\\", \\"coordinates\\": [ 72.7832162, 23.5274274 ] } } ] } Inscriptions of the Vastupala-Vihara on Mount Girnar A large number of inscriptions of Vastupala and Tejapala, some short while others are very long, are available. Most of these inscriptions are in the Girnar range (VS 1288, VS 1289, VS 1293) and Abu (VS 1278, VS 1287, VS 1288, VS 1290, VS 1293, VS 1296) while a few are at the Taranga hills (VS 1285), Vaidyanatha-prashsti of Dabhoi (1255 CE) by Someshwara, Patan, Sherisa (VS 1285, near Ahmedabad), Khambhat (VS 1281), Nagara (VS 1292, near Khambhat), Ganesar (VS 1291, near Dholka), Dhammani (1296, Sirohi) and Nava Sanghpur (near Vijapur). The majority of such inscriptions are found in temples. Jinaprabha's Sukrita-kirti-kallolini (1231 CE) and Jayasimha's Vastupala-Tejapala-Prashsti are known from the manuscripts but these inscriptions have not survived. All these inscriptions are contemporary or near-contemporary.

The organisation aimed to spread the teachings of Shivaji and his son Sambhaji. He has a number of followers in Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune, Belgaum, Mumbai and Satara. He was described in a 2018 media report as being close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 2008, his followers ransacked movie halls showing the film, Jodhaa Akbar; Bhide was arrested for his role in the unrest. In June 2018, Bhide was reported as having said at a rally that eating the fruits of a mango tree from his orchard had helped couples conceive male children. An advisory committee under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) (PCPNDT) Act asked the Nashik Municipal Corporation to file a court case against him. On 2 January 2018, a First Information Report was filed against him and Milind Ekbote for inciting the 1 January 2018 violence on Dalits in Bhima Koregaon. Sambhajirao claimed that the roots of the violence lay in the Elgar Parishad of 31 December 2017. He demanded that leaders such as Prakash Ambedkar, who had spoken at the event be arrested. In August, a petition was filed before the Bombay High Court seeking his arrest for his role in the Bhima Koregaon violence.

He was arrested in December 1963 after he attacked a 12-year-old in the \\"Alexander the Great\\" orphanage, was tried in October 1964 and sentenced to nine years in prison. During interrogations, he confessed to being the notorious \\"Ogre of Seikh Sou\\". He was retried in February 1966 and sentenced to death as a \\"dangerous person for public safety\\", and was executed on February 16, 1968. Pagratidis quickly recanted his confession, claiming he was psychologically pressured and beaten, and until the moment of his execution, he remained firm in his innocence. Since then, whether he was innocent or not remains debatable, with most claiming he was innocent.  Early life  He was born in May 1940 in the village of Langadikia, the youngest of three children to poor farmers. His father, Charalambos Pagratidis, captain of the Greek army in World War II, was assassinated by ELAS guerillas during the civil war period in 1945. The family (Aristidis' brother Pangratis, his sister Marika, himself and their mother Eleni), having lost their basic support, left Langadikia and settled in Toumba. The mother tried to preserve the family by taking any available work, later acquainting with a bus collector, Evgenios Alexiadis, marrying him and keeping with them Aristidis, while the older children were sent to live with relatives in Piraeus. Aristidis, or Aristos as some called him, attended only the first two grades of primary school (of which the first grade took three years to finish), and had problem with writing and reading. He worked various menial jobs, from a lemon seller to a glazier, from a shredder to a waiter and from a hammock at the Thessaloniki harbor, to an assistant in amusement parks. At the age of 10 he was sexually assaulted by a chemist for drachmas. Since then, when hunger threatened his life, he was used this way to make money. One of his first clients was a blacksmith named Vasilis Baradazoglou, who, in his court statement said with the lure of the little money he gave him, Pagratidis let him laugh: This child, Pagratidis, I met ten years ago. He sold his body for ten drachmas. He was coming with me and doing the job. I approached him. I knew it was a sign. We went to Rendzhi, I gave him 15 drachmas. I've been with him many times. So have other men in the harbor. In 1955, he stole 120 drachmas from the canteen of the P.A.O.K. gymnasium, was arrested and put under a child welfare program. In the same year, he stole and sold two bikes along with a friend, and with the money he planned to move to Athens. But both were apprehended, tried by the Minority Court of Thessaloniki and sent to the Minor Restoration Center in Vido. In 1957 he left the institution, returned to Thessaloniki and resumed work at the port. He also worked as a waiter in a country house, a waiter in a cafeteria, and any other work that he could find. In 1959, while working in the city circus, he was drafted into the army. In 1960, he was put into the 20th Armored Cavalry Division. After his desertion in May 1961, he was dismissed as mentally disturbed due to his drug addiction. He often visited prostitutes, but was also issued to men willing to pay as a cross-dresser, smoking hashish and drinking wine.In the typical way at the time, the court prosecutor wrote: \\"Pangratidis, in no case of diligence and education, has been turned into a way of corruption, having acquired a great deal of anomalous character and confused ... He was an energetic homosexual, voyeur, a robber, an outsider, a drinker, a deserter, and a hashish abuser.\\"  Arrest  At 3:00 on December 7, 1963, Pagratidis entered secretly the \\"Alexander the Great\\" orphanage, equipped with a stone, and at the orphanage's sickroom he attempted to smite and rape a 12-year-old girl. The child's screaming, however, frightened him and fled. Along the way he came across a city bus driver, who saw him running nervously and stopped the man. Pagratidis managed to flee, but the driver alerted the police. A police officer remembered seeing Pagratidis spying around the orphanage some hours before he invaded and asked for details. So, three hours after the attack, the police arrived at his home in Upper Toumba's 'German' area, not far from the orphanage, and arrested him. Pagratidis did not resist, and after he was recognized by the victim and the bus driver, he confessed. The newspapers, at the very first mention of it, connected Pagratidis with an unknown criminal called the \\"Ogre of Seikh Sou\\". = \\"The Ogre of Seikh Sou\\" = In February 1958, in the area of the Panorama forest, a young woman was killed with a stone by an unknown young man. The accidental presence of a car that was going up in the woods, however, blew the perpetrator out. Seikh Sou A year later, on February 19, 1959, the perpetrator attacked again, this time a couple ‚Äì Athanasios Panagiotou and Eleonora Vlachogianni ‚Äì who wanted to be isolated in the forest, suffering heavy injuries. Doctors made great efforts to save their lives and eventually succeeded. In the next few months, the perpetrator attacks another two couples in the area, but without any significant injuries. On March 6, 1959, he struck again in Mikra, killing Konstantinos Raisis and raping his girlfriend Evdokia Paliogiannis. On April 3 of the same year, he entered the Municipal Hospital of Thessaloniki and killed with a stone one of the foundation's nurses, Melpomeni Patrikio. While he was leaving the building, he attacked another nurse who crossed paths with him, Faney Tsambazi, threatening to kill her before leaving.ŒïœÜŒ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒØŒ¥Œ± ¬´ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒØŒ±¬ª œÜœçŒªŒªŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ 15/12/1963, œÉŒµŒª. 8 In March 1959, a prize of 100,000 drachmas was announced for the killer's capture.

Since his adolescence he had involved with them, first with bicycle theft, and then with petty thefts, possession and use of hashish, allegations of hunter-gatherer behaviour, and attacks on young girls and young men. From the very first moment of his arrest, the newspapers (with or without the police's encouragement) have pointed him out as the \\"Ogre of Seikh Sou\\", aggressively stressing out the point that he had used the same weapon as the Ogre while attempting to rape the girl. In the following days he was isolated in the General Security Detention Facilities in Thessaloniki, the survivors of the attacks were called upon to identify him, but none were able to do so with certainty. For five whole days and nights after his arrest, Pagratidis was questioned. The investigation was carried out by Deputy Prosecutor Athanasopoulos along with General Security Commander of Thessaloniki, Tzavaras. On December 11, 1963, Pagratidis confessed to the crimes he was accused of. The news was not given to the public immediately, rather than three days later - on December 15, - since, in the meantime, the police received a full confession with many previously unknown details. Specifically, Pagratidis led the police officers to the site of the Mikra site, and showed them how he killed Raisis (two strikes with the stone to his head), how he stunned his girlfriend, raped her and stole Raisis' lighter, leaving afterwards. The next day he went to the Municipal Hospital, where he killed, raped and robbed the young Patrikio. Then, he narrated the attempted murder of nurse Tsambazi, whom had failed to positively recognize him. The competent prosecutor described the attack on the 12-year-old and in conjunction with the \\"4000 Law\\", referring the case (enclosing the 1953 crime files) to the regular investigator to proceed to the next stage of the trial, regular interrogation. As soon as his own people took care of lawyers, M. Sapountzis and D. Lazo, and now he was in the hands of the judiciary, he immediately recalled his confession. He claimed that not only were the confessions forced, but the orphanage attack did not take place as disclosed by the police. Pagratidis informed his lawyers that he was subjected to physical and mental abuse, saying the following: \\"At 9 o'clock at night, they said I should confess, and put me in a room, splashing water on me. Then we went to another room, where they only gave a nut to eat. There they kept me up until 10 AM. I was asking for water and they did not give me. 'Tell us', they were telling me, 'that you are the ogre and we will give you'... In the meantime, by thirst, I stammered. For a moment I did not stand. 'Give me water', I said, 'and I will tell you what you want.\\" Pagratidis told his lawyers that during the six days of the interrogation he only drank two glasses of water and a glass of tea, and ate four slices of bread, three sandwiches, a plate of potatoes, and a spinach dish. Surprised by what the lawyers said, on December 18, judicial authorities forbid any further reference or photograph of this case to all newspapers in Thessaloniki and Athens. Heptapyrgion prison  The trial for attempted rape  On October 5, 1964, while the regular investigation into the Seikh Sou forest murders was not yet over, Aristidis was tried in the Heptapyrgion prison by the Thessaloniki Court for the attempted rape of 12-year-old Aikaterini Sourpa. The victim, orphanage employees and friends of Pagratidis were present. Pagratidis' friends testified that in that the past hours they were all together in a tavern where they drank heavily, and when they separated, Aristos was drunk. This was also claimed to by his attorneys, which eventually succeeded in persuading the jury, who changed the accusation from \\"rape attempt\\" to \\"coercion into futility\\". Based on this decision, his court imposed a nine-year prison sentence, a five-year deprivation of his civil rights, and a pecuniary allowance of 7,000 drachmas to the victim. Pagratidis told in his apology: \\"What they say about the crimes is lies. I did not kill everybody. I admit that I went to the 'Alexander the Great' orphanage to hurt the girl, but was because of the wine and hashish. I did this and I confess it. But I did not kill to get money. I was tortured as a teen. I was selling my body for 10 drachmas to eat. I was selling my blood to the Red Cross to get money to eat. I'm not a criminal. If I wanted to become a criminal, I would kill my father's killer who lives today in our village. I confess that I was wrong. I was wrong a lot. And that's why I want you to try me. Inside the prison I saw a lot and learned a lot. Now I have changed and that's why I want to be punished.\\"ŒïœÜ. ¬´ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒØŒ±¬ª, œÜœçŒªŒªŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ 7/10/1964, œÉŒµŒª. 3  The trial  His trial, which, as expected was gathering crowds every day, and was one of the most important event for Thessaloniki at the time. It began on Friday, February 11, 1966, at the Pentecostal Court of Appeal of Thessaloniki and ended on February 22, 1966, with the declaration that Pagratidis was guilty of all the accused crimes, and sentenced to four counts of the death penalty.Œ§Œø Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫œå œÉœçœÉœÑŒ∑ŒºŒ± Œ∏ŒµœéœÅŒ∑œÉŒµ œåœÑŒπ Œ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑œÑŒøœÅ œÑŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ¥Œ∑ Œ≥ŒπŒ± œÑŒπœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøŒ∫œÑŒøŒΩŒØŒµœÇ ŒÆœÑŒ±ŒΩ Œ∑ ŒªŒ∑œÉœÑŒµŒØŒ± œÑœâŒΩ Œ∏œÖŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ. The president of the court was the aesthetist of Thessaloniki, Aletras, and congressmen were Kounougeris, Gallas, Graphicanakis and Papayiannis, while the then prosecutor's office was occupied by the then Deputy Prosecutor of the Court of Appeal Michalis Sgouritsas. As a civil action, the attorneys of Athanasios Panagiotou and the attorneys of Raisis family were present. Ombudsmen of Pagratidis were the lawyers appointed by his brother, M. Sapontzis and D. LazoOn the first day of the trial, the survivors of the murderous attacks, Athansios and Eleonora, as well as nurse Faney Tsambazi, were examined but they did not recognize Pagratidis as a perpetrator, the first two because they did not even see the perpetrator, and the second because he could not remember with certainty. Also deposited by the passing soldiers who found the bodies of the victims and his friend but they also did not recognize anybody. The findings of the coroner's autopsy were read in the bodies of Raisis and Paliogiannis, from which three different types of blood were found: the two were identified as those of the victims, and the third (reasonably belonging to the perpetrator) was found to be similar to the type of Pagratidis. (fourth type negative of the killer - fourth positive type Pangratidis).œåœÄŒøœÖ Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ¨œÑœâ, œÜœçŒªŒªŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ 12/2/1966 The next day will testify as witnesses of Pagratidis, people from the social environment and then Prof. of Neurology and Psychiatry of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Ag. Diakoniannis. According to his words in court, \\"Pagratidis has been a person with a lot of anomalous character, and he it is perverse, energetic, homosexual, voyeuristic, hangs around thieves, drunkards, and hashish abusers. Of the questions which he were submitted to him, he was sure that he did not show psychosis.\\" Diakoniannis' statement was decisive for the future of Pagratidis. The psychiatrist, with all the prestige and respect that his specialty and his course in his society has given, considered that when Pagratidis confessed all the crimes in front of him, he described them in detail by believing the police officers who told him that he would be tortured with some year prison in Kassandreia, made him calmly conscious, spontaneous, and honestly, and without showing that he was just repeating that he had been asked. The next two days will be called upon by several police officers present during Pangratidis' detention days and during the representations made, who of course denied that the confession was based on pressure or deprivation. On February 14, Pangratidis' lawyers, having faced the refusal of the judges to accept any of their requests, and the continued intervention of the president during the examination of police witnesses, said they could no longer carry out their duties and resigned. The news fell like a bomb, since everyone knew that no one could successfully replace the advocates who had been handling the case for two years, and Pagratidis was panicking more than ever. The court appointed new lawyers, interrupted for one day, but when the case was resumed on 16 February, his lawyers returned.ŒïœÜ. ¬´ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒØŒ±¬ª, œÜœçŒªŒªŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ 15/2/1966 On February 17, in his brother's testimony, Pagratis Pagratidis, a goldsmith by profession, defended his brother. Pangratis Pagratidis \\"blamed and named as a perpetrator for the crimes Aiada Sklavounos, son of the doctor and University professor, Georgios Sklavounos\\". According to a pronounced complaint by a letter read in court, Aiada Sklavounos, a schizophrenic, stayed at that time in the family villa next to the Seikh Sou Forest and was responsible for the murderous attacks of that time. However, the court refused to consider this version as having no direct connection with the trial (the court was considering whether or not Pagratidis was guilty of the specific crimes, and not who the ogre was). Following a series of protests by the defense, - the lack of jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as the crime of robbery was not proven and the referral of the case to the Assize Court - which was also rejected by the lawyers - once again - resigned by feeling that it was not they can assume responsibility for defending themselves since they lack essential resources to exercise it. The court appointed new lawyers, criminal investigators Gerogiannis and Katsouni, and gave a deadline of February 22 to study the case and prepare their reasons after the evidentiary procedure was over. On Tuesday, February 22, 1966 and after Pagratidis refused to apologize and give the judges the opportunity to ask him questions, the prosecutor of the head office Michalis Sgouritsas received the floor. The prosecutor pointed out that although he has no doubt that Pagratidis is guilty of the crimes he is accused of, he considers that he should not be subject to the death penalty - a penalty imposed only on persons threatening the security of the country - but to life imprisonment and ten-year deprivation of his political rights. The evidence of the guilt of Pangratidis was considered the murder weapon - the stone - a common element in all crimes, the lack of accusation of the accused, since he could not prove where he was at the time the crimes were committed, and of course the confession of his crimes in front of the psychiatrist, the prosecutor stressed on the occasion that he considered the court to be inappropriate to judge the matter after it had been proved that Pangratidis' motivation was the manslaughter itself and not the robbery, and suggested to the judges that the case be referred to the Assize Court. The reason was followed by the advocates of political education who, of course, demanded his exemplary punishment, and finally the newly appointed Pangratidis lawyers spoke. The lawyers analyzed all the signs of violations of the prisoner's rights, such as the lack of a lawyer, the effort to identify him with the perpetrator of the previous crimes, the deprivations imposed on him, the ill-treatment he suffered and asked to calculate his young age, and its dependence on drugs as a means of reducing the penalty. The court, after a one-hour meeting, announced that it considers Pangratidis guilty of all crimes, and even points out that they were done in a way particularly horrible by a perpetrator dangerous to public security. After hearing the opinion of the prosecutor and the advocates, he announced the death penalty for each of the robberies and the sentence of the Patrikio and for the attempted robbery against Paleogiannis. He also gave financial compensation to Athanasios Panagioutou as well as to the family of Konstantinos Raisis. On February 25, 1966, his lawyers appealed the court's decision. The reasons they invoked were: * The incidents that have been proven in court showed manslaughter rather than robbery as the main purpose of crimes, so the case was for the Assize Court, not the Court of Appeal. * The filing of the psychiatrist Diakonnis was taken irregularly and should therefore be considered as non- generational, as the doctor can not testify to the audience and be obliged to announce his confindetial conversations with his patient. * The court unlawfully allowed Panagioutou's lawyer to ask questions to the accused in matters unrelated to the clients' case. * Pagratidis was convicted of the attempted robbery of Paligionnis improperly, since the referral order had not attributed him to the accusation. * His conviction for the attempted robbery against Paliogionnis has not been proven and substantiated in court. In September 1966, when the council of the Supreme Court met on the case, the appeal was dismissed on all aspects. Inside the Heptapyrgion prison  Execution  On February 16, 1968 at 7:05 in the morning, Pagratidis was executed by firing squad on a site in the Seikh Sou forest, near the place where the crimes were committed. Pagratidis himself learned of his impending execution the previous night. When he arrived at the site, and after accepting to tie his eyes, he said shortly before he died: \\"However, I am innocent. Perhaps one day the culprit will be caught and then..\\" After the execution, a police patrol took the corpse - and without any notice from his relatives - was buried in the cemetery of the adjacent community of Thessaloniki Exodus, after the funeral. Relatives read the news from the afternoon newspapers.ŒµœÜ. ¬´ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒØŒ±¬ª, œÜœçŒªŒªŒø œÑŒ∑œÇ 17Œ∑œÇ Œ¶ŒµŒ≤œÅŒøœÖŒ±œÅŒØŒøœÖ 1968, œÉŒµŒª. 1 Œ∫Œ±Œπ 5 Seikh Sou  Questionable guilt  A journalist from the newspaper \\"Makedonia\\", whom followed from the beginning to the end of the case states that \\"after his arrest, when the data showed that this is the same person who made the 1959 crimes, the security commander N. Tzavaras informed Prosecutor D. Papantoniou that the preliminary investigation of the attack on the orphanage had been completed and he asked him to continue the preliminary investigation, because he \\"smelled\\" an ogre. At that time, prosecutor Nikos Athanasopoulos was sent to the security and the questioning was done only in his presence. Pagratidis, who believed that because of the attack will be tried with extenuating circumstances and will serve his sentence in rural prisons recounted his life, abnormalities and crimes committed with details that no one knows Until then and which coincided with the findings of crimes committed four years ago. Indeed, the prosecutor Athanasopoulos, who is known not to be covered by the police, when the preliminary investigation is over, said: \\"I am so confident that he is that\\". The same opinion with the prosecutor was the investigator Kiousis: \\"I'm 2,000% sure he is,\\" he told reporters. Indeed, there were so many details he had revealed about findings in the crime scene, many of which were not exploited by the police as they believed they were not related to the murders. It is characteristic that for the last attack in the hospital he referred to a button and some small ones he had lost leaving the place, which the police officers could not imagine belonging to the perpetrator. He was certainly the offender of the crimes he was accused of. Those who support the opposite. The writer Sakis Serefas argues that: \\"... A local community bastardized along with the police and judiciary put in the middle a little man and devoured him... A punk operated as a pleasure hole for the scum of the city, coming from a family that bled in the Civil War. At the same time, a man-eating local society, the partisan at his daughters, and the police who fought fearlessly at her nails and the judiciary, in turn, smuggled. The question is not whether Pagratidis was innocent or guilty, but that he did not have a fair trial, making his execution criminal\\". This view was embraced by writer Thomas Korovinis: \\"The Thessaloniki era was characterized by a deep state - remnants of security battalions and Organization X - frightening the city with the air of course received from the Security. The \\"Brooch\\" , which solves and ties, consists of ruffians and crafters who are hurting and doing what they want. Lambrakis' murderers are being bombed.

Born and raised on Oahu and living most of his post-university life on the Big Island of Hawaii, he is known for his impressionistic paintings and murals of Hawaiiana. He is best known internationally for his 2003 painting of the volcano goddess Pele, which was chosen from more than 140 entries to represent the goddess at the Hawai ªi Volcanoes National Park, and is on display at the main visitor center there. He is also known for his Hawaiian landscape paintings, including those of the rural tree-lined coastal Red Road in Lower Puna. Life and career Johnsen was born in Hawaii on the island of Oahu, and attended Punahou High School, graduating in 1970. He studied graphic design at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1974. He returned to Oahu for work and further study, lived for a while in Volcano Village on the Big Island beginning in the late 1970s, and later spent five years in Los Angeles doing freelance design work in the garment and costume industry. He moved to Puna on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1989. He was artist- in-residence at Kalani Oceanside Retreat from 1989‚Äì1998, and also did fabric design for Kona Village Resort. In 1992 he moved to his own house in the Lower Puna area. His paintings were sold at the Ohana o Hawaii gallery in Hilo, and when owner Randy Farias retired in 2005, it was renamed the Arthur Johnsen Gallery under the ownership of Johnsen and a business partner. In 2012, Johnsen closed the gallery and moved his paintings to the newly formed One Gallery in Hilo. Johnsen also created murals commissioned by a number of resorts, restaurants, public buildings, and cruise ships throughout the Hawaiian islands. His works were exhibited at venues including the Volcano Art Center, Honolulu Hale, and the East Hawaii Cultural Center. In 2013 he was exhibited at the Andrew Rose Gallery in Honolulu, among eleven artists collectively considered the \\"leading landscape painters from the Islands\\". A retrospective of his work, in particular his plein air impressionistic paintings of vistas of the Red Road in Lower Puna, was presented by the East Hawaii Cultural Center at the Hawaii Museum of Contemporary Art from January 3‚Äì29, 2014. The museum and cultural center published a book of the exhibited works, entitled Paintings of the Red Road by Arthur Johnsen. Some of Johnsen's paintings have been held by Cedar Street Gallery in Honolulu. Some of his paintings are currently held at Third Dimension Gallery in Kamuela. The Goddess Pele In early 2003, the group of Native Hawaiian elders, or kupuna, advising the superintendent of Hawai ªi Volcanoes National Park on cultural matters were concerned that the painting of the volcano goddess Pele in the main visitor center did not portray the goddess in a culturally appropriate manner. The portrayal which had been on display at the center since 1966, a 1927 painting by D. Howard Hitchcock, pictured Pele as a blonde Caucasian woman. The Kupuna Committee and the park staff worked with the Sacred Mountains Program of The Mountain Institute, which had funds from the Ford Foundation, to put out a state-wide call in March 2003 for paintings of Pele which the elders would select from in August of that year. An $8,000 prize for the winning entry was offered. More than 140 paintings were submitted for the competition. Johnsen's entry, titled The Goddess Pele, was selected in the blind competition as the winner, as best representing Pele's \\"deepest cultural meanings\\". It depicts Pele with a serene, compassionate expression and two objects in her hands representing important stories connected with her, against a background of volcanic activity. Johnsen used a Native Hawaiian as his model, and lit her face from below; living near Kalapana and having watched many lava flows at night, he knew that lava throws light from below up toward faces. The portrayal depicts Pele striding through the lava flow in the forest with her digging staff P√£'oa, which she used for excavating while searching for a home that she finally found at Halema ªuma ªu, in her left hand. Her right hand holds an egg containing her unborn sister goddess Hi'iaka, which she carried on her journey from Tahiti. The painting represents a more native view of Pele, who is regarded by Native Hawaiians not as a wrathful deity but as a benevolent, life-giving goddess who creates new land with her lava. Plate 5. In interviews, Johnsen stated, \\"I show her with a staff in one hand to represent her as a destroyer, and cradling an egg in the other, representing regeneration and the fact that new life springs up from lava.\\" \\"It's not all about destruction. The egg is a symbol of regeneration and new life. Lava creates new land as well as it destroys old places.\\" He noted that he had been living in Puna, close to the active lava flows, since 1989, and had seen the destruction of Kalapana and the beach at Kaimu, and had watched lava flows from his home. He added that his proximity to the steady active lava flows made him \\"feel closely connected [to Pele] on a very personal level\\". In 2005, Hawai ªi Volcanoes National Park finished refurbishing its Visitor Center, and replaced the Hitchcock painting with Johnsen's The Goddess Pele. It is on permanent display beside the center's fireplace. Personal life Johnsen lived along the Red Road near Kehena in Lower Puna on the Big Island of Hawaii, in the home he built in 1992. He died in November 2015 following a sudden illness.

Scythian art The art of Kazakhstan covers all forms of art created throughout history by the peoples living on the territory of modern-day Kazakhstan. Throughout most periods, much of the population of Kazakhstan was nomadic, or at least moved regularly across the vast country. The great majority of the art of Kazakhstan is applied art: the decoration of practical objects, including household utensils and patterned harnesses, through art forms such as carpet-weaving, pottery, and leatherwork. The art of Kazakhstan also includes architecture, fine arts, and sculpture. Although modern Kazakhs are often keen to assert its national character, Kazakh art has at most times been intimately connected with wider artistic styles, in particular the Scythian art of the first millennium BC, and Islamic art from the 8th century AD onwards. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Russian art was the dominant influence.  History  Petroglyphs in Tamgaly, Kazakhstan = Prehistory = Prehistoric rock engravings and paintings occupy a prominent place among Kazakhstan's monuments. Rock engravings, or petroglyphs, embossed in the rock with stone or metal tools, are particularly common, and the geology and landforms of the country's mountain ranges lent themselves to the proliferation of this art form. The absence of anthropogenic impact across most of the country has resulted in preservation of many of these monuments, providing rich material for study. The earliest examples of art in Kazakhstan are Paleolithic. Found in the Hantau and Karatau Mountains, they take the form of animal images carved into the rocks. Neolithic and Bronze Age petroglyphs found in the Bayanaulsky cave (Pavlodar region), and in the Tanbaly gorge (Almaty region) (where the images include an elk, a lion, a hunter with a bow, an ox harnessed to a cart, and a cow) and on the northern shores of Lake Balkhash (a duel between two men with sabers, next to which stands a girl, and others) give an idea of the main occupations and customs of the ancient tribes inhabiting the territory of modern Kazakhstan. The petroglyphs of the Tamgaly archaeological complex, one of the most ancient and vivid rock art monuments of the \\"Seven Rivers\\" (Zhetysu, or Semirechye) area near Lake Balkhash, lie 170 km north-west of the city of Almaty in the Anrakai Mountains. The rock paintings and engravings were discovered in 1957 by an archaeological expedition of the Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences, under the direction of A. G. Maximova. Study of the sanctuary there, with its many cave paintings, began in the 1970s and 1980s. There are some 2000 petroglyphs, most of which are located in the lower part of the main gorge and on the side of the adjacent gorge to the west. The themes of the drawings are diverse, and include human figures, animals, horsemen, people and predatory animals hunting, scenes of daily life, ritual dances, sun-headed deities, and multi-figure compositions depicting scenes of people and animals, of hunting animals and of bull sacrifice. The most common images are of horses; deer, which symbolize power and beauty in Kazakh art; and eagles, representing immortality and the sky. In the Bronze Age, the territory of modern Kazakhstan was inhabited by people of the Andronovo culture, and the Begazy-Dandybai culture in the south. The Andronovo culture processed metal ores, including gold, copper, and probably silver. In some areas this was a large-scale industry.Kuz'mina, 89-94 Although significant survivals are rare, it is clear that textiles, mostly woolen, were in general use for clothing, along with leather and fur. Clothing was often richly decorated with metal and stone jewellery. Greek descriptions of Iron Age steppe nomad dress survive, along with Greek and Persian depictions of related steppe-dwelling peoples.Kuz'mina, 101-105 =Protohistory= Golden Man replica in the Central State Museum In the first millennium BC, the territory of present-day Kazakhstan in the Ili River area was occupied by the Saka tribes, whose works of art formed part of the wider tradition of Scythian art across the Eurasian steppe. Most artifacts found have come from kurgan burial mounds. The most famous Saka-era discovery was made in the Issyk kurgan in south-eastern Kazakhstan, near Almaty city, in 1969. Known as the \\"Golden Man\\", this wealthy Saka man or woman was costumed in armor, boots and hat decorated with many gold plates, so that the burial resembled a statue in precious metals. Most of the jewelry found was of gold, made by casting, stamping, embossing, and engraving in the form of circular sculpture, high relief and bas-relief. The \\"Golden Man\\" wears a high-peaked turban decorated with golden plates depicting horses, snow leopards, birds, and trees with spreading crowns, and a necklace in the form of a golden hoop with a tiger head at each extremity. In the lobe of the left ear is a gold earring with a turquoise ornament. A sword in a sheath covered with red leather hangs from the belt to the right, and to the left is an iron dagger in a sheath with gold overlays depicting a galloping moose and a horse. On gold plates on both sides of the dagger are carved animal figures, among them the wolf, fox, mountain sheep, fallow deer, fox, and snake. The tall hat compares with the tall saukele head-dress that is today part of the traditional wedding costume for Kazakh women.Archaeology magazine - Chieftain or Warrior Priestess? The treasures of the Issyk mound, including an exact copy of the \\"Golden Man\\", were originally exhibited at the Kazakh Museum of Archeology in Almaty, and are now at the State Museum of Gold and Precious Metals of the Republic of Kazakhstan in Astana. The \\"golden man\\" on the winged leopard has become one of the main symbols of Kazakhstan. Many \\"balbals\\" or kurgan stelae, monoliths shaped like human figures, have been found topping kurgans, or surrounding them in groups. = Islamic period = Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, in the city of Turkistan, 1389. In the Middle Ages, various states succeeded each other across the territory of modern Kazakhstan. Active trade along the Great Silk Road enriched the culture of the people who lived there, bringing new art techniques and influencing the creativity of local artists. On the Silk Road, the cities of Isfijab, Yangikent, Suyab, Kayalyk Mirki, and Kulan in the valleys of the rivers Syr Darya, Talas, Chu, and Ili were centers of culture, religion, and trade, providing a connection between agricultural oases and nomadic steppe, between East and West. The medieval centers of culture, science, and art were the cities of Otrar, Taraz, Balasagun, Sygnak, and Sauran, among many others. The mausoleums of Babaji-Khatun (10th‚Äì11th centuries), Aisha-Bibi (11th‚Äì12th centuries), Alash-khan (12th‚Äì14th centuries), Dzhuchi-khan (13th century), Kozy-Korpesh, and Bayan-Slu (8th‚Äì10th centuries), and the tower of Tamerlane (14th century) are considered unique examples of the architecture of this time. The Khoja Ahmed Yassavi Mausoleum complex, in the city of Turkistan, stands out as one of the largest architectural monuments not only of Kazakhstan but of Central Asia. Built by order of Timur (14th century) in honor of the preacher Yassavi, the mausoleum was constructed of fired brick, set inside and out with multi-colored blue and white tiles, and decorated with carved elements, tiled Arabic inscriptions, mosaic work and painted majolica. The central hall contains a huge cauldron cast from an alloy of seven metals, which was exhibited in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia, between 1935 and its return in 1989. In the 14th and 15th centuries, great progress was made in the use of architectural elements such as arches, vaults, and domes. The medieval builders attached great importance to their building materials, and already at that time brick and glazes of notable quality were made. Particular attention was paid to the quality of the bricks, most of which were square in shape with one side painted blue, white or green. Such bricks were laid simultaneously with the building of external walls. Polychrome majolica tiles were also used in wall decoration. In the interiors, murals and relief ornaments began to appear. Applied art featured widely in the construction of the mausoleums of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi, Kok-Kesen and Alash Khan. In the Middle Ages, among other applied arts, carpet-weaving and pottery became widespread in Kazakhstan. Richly patterned carpets were used both in the home, as decoration, and worn, as protection against the elements. Common patterns ornamenting carpets, household items and kitchen utensils included floral motifs, hunting scenes, folk games, animals, and birds. The image of the horse as a central motif is found throughout Kazakhstan, personifying beauty and power. Horses were of great cultural significance as a means of transport, especially in wartime, and were sacrificed to the gods and interred alongside warriors in burial mounds. Pottery items were often decorated with inscriptions in different languages, such as Turkic, Uighur, and Sogdian. Examples include the ceramic inscriptions found in the archaeological city of Aktobe, located in the middle reaches of the Chu River. Many inscriptions found on these ceramics date back to the 9th‚Äì11th centuries. = Modern period = In Kazakhstan, fine art in the classical sense has its origins in the 19th century and the influence of Russian artists Vasily Vereshchagin and Nikolai Khludov, who travelled in Central Asia and portrayed what they saw. Khludov had a particular influence on the development of the local school of painting, becoming the teacher of many local artists. The most famous of these is Abilkhan Kasteyev, after whom the State Museum of Art of Kazakhstan was renamed. The Kazakh school of art was fully formed by the 1940s, and flourished in the 1950s. Local painters, graphic artists and sculptors, trained under the unified Soviet system of artist education, began active work, often using national motifs in their art. The painters O. Tansykbaev, J. Shardenov, K. Telzhanov, and S. Aitbaev, graphic artists E. Sidorkina and A. Duzelkhanov, and sculptors H. Nauryzbaeva and E. Sergebaeva are today counted among the key figures of Kazakhstani art. An avant-garde movement formed in Kazakhstan in the late 1980s, aiming to find fresh ideas and protest against established forms and images in art. Various principles of plastic art began to appear, for example in B. Tulkeev's highly complex psychological compositions, A. Sydykhanov's mystical graphic compositions, A. Akanaeva's Picasso-like improvised compositions, and D. Aliyev's chaotic figurative pieces. K. Duisenbaev used principles of plastic art in expressive formalism to convey the inner forces of nature and the soul. K. Akhmetzhanov's canvases optically assemble colored pieces to produce a picture of the world that reflects surrounding realities. The works of A. Menlibayev and E. Ghazaryan exemplify a revival of interest in the folklore and ornamental style of a range of historical, regional and cultural tradition.Golden Man on top of the Independence MonumentMythological symbolism is significant in Kazakhstan's modern art. It is expressed, for example, in the visual searching of artists Gulnara Kasmalieva and Muratbek Djumaliev's \\"TransSiberian Amazons\\" (2005) and multi-channel video art \\"A New Silk Road: Algorithm of Survival and Hope‚Äù (2007), and in the performance and photography of Victor and Elena Vorobievs' ‚Äú(Non)Silk Road‚Äù (2006). Since Kazakhstan's declaration of independence, on 16 December 1991, there have been cardinal changes in all spheres: political, economic, social and art. The monument to Ablai Khan in Astana (sculptor N. Dalbai, architect Sh. Valikhanov) made a considerable contribution to approval of the idea of independence of Kazakhstan. Other landmarks of modern monumental sculpture of this time are the equestrian monument to Isatay Taimanov and Makhambet Utemisov in Atyrau (sculptor B.Abishev and E.Sergebaev), and the monument to Sultan Beibars in Atyrau (sculptor K. Kakimov). The Independence Monument in Almaty (sculptors: A.Zhumabaev and N.Dalbai, architect Sh.Valihanov) is a particularly well-known modern sculptural and architectural complex of this era. Located on Almaty's main square, the Independence Monument combines Kazakh cultural heritage and tradition with universal elements, and has become a symbol of statehood, and of Kazakhstan's past, present and future. The granite stele is crowned with the statue of a young warrior, styled after the \\"Golden Man\\", with a mythical winged leopard his feet.

Adrenopause is the decline in secretion and levels of adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) from the zona reticularis of the adrenal glands with age. Levels of adrenal androgens start to increase around age 7 or 8 years (adrenarche), peak in early adulthood around age 20 to 25 years, and decrease at a rate of approximately 2% per year thereafter, eventually reaching levels of 10 to 20% of those of young adults by age 80 years. It is caused by the progressive apoptosis of adrenal androgen-secreting cells and hence involution of the zona reticularis. It is analogous to andropause in men and menopause in women, the abrupt or gradual decline in production of sex hormones from the gonads with age. DHEA can be supplemented or taken as a medication in the form of prasterone to replace adrenal androgens later in life if it is desired.

Arrest  In 1990 Junni's now grown up son revealed to the police that the death of his mother had not indeed been an accident, in fact he had been preparing to leave for school on the morning when he saw his father stomping on his mother's head and before dragging her unconscious body into the bathtub. Junni was taken in for interrogation, where he first confessed to his wife's murder. However, police later found out that a man named Matti Haapanen who they needed for interrogation regarding the killing of Junni's wife, had actually burned up with his small summer cottage in Kivinokka few years earlier. The investigators got suspicious after the wife of Matti told them that after her husband's death, Ismo had started to tell weird stories about how he had actually been at the scene of the fire that day. After being questioned about the case, Junni slowly cracked and described in every detail how he and Matti had got drunk at Matti's cottage that night. This resulted in a brawl between the two men. Junni then bashed his friend over the head with a huge glass bowl, stole his dental prosthesis and yanked out one of his own teeth before setting the house in flames. When the investigation went on, it turned out that there had been many more deaths by house fire in the area. Junni confessed in detail to all his killings over the years and he was able to be connected to the events. In the Municipal Court in Helsinki, Junni recanted his confession and claimed that he was trying to please his examiners. However, he was found guilty of the murder of his wife, Seppo M√§ntyniemi, Juha V√§re, Matti Haapanen and Pauli Sironen, as well as arson, and sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1992. The Helsinki Appellate Court changed his wife's death from assault to negligent homicide, however, the penal sanction did not change. Junni committed suicide in 1995.

The committee meets twice yearly to review the latest research regarding vaccination against infectious diseases. Although the STIKO makes recommendations, immunization in Germany is voluntary and there are no official government recommendations. German Federal States typically follow the STIKO's recommendations minimally, although each state can make recommendations for their geographic jurisdiction that extends beyond the recommended list. In addition to the proposed immunization schedule for children and adults, the STIKO recommends vaccinations for occupational groups, police, travelers, and other at risk groups.  History  The STIKO was established in 1972 as a department of the German Federal Health Agency in Berlin. During a reorganization of the Federal Health Agency in 1994, the STIKO was attached to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) in Berlin which was now an independent Upper-level federal agency under the purview of the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG). RKI compiles data of immunization status upon the entry of children at school, and measures vaccine coverage of Germany at a national level. The legal basis for the STIKO is ¬ß20 of the Infection Protection Act (, or IfSG). Members of the expert body are appointed by the Federal Ministry of Health in coordination with the state ministries of health. Additional expert representatives from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, Robert Koch Institute Federal and state ministries of health attend the meetings in an advisory capacity.  Responsibility  The commission's responsibility is to provide scientifically based recommendations regarding the necessary vaccinations in Germany. Due to the importance of the recommendations, these have been codified in the Infection Protection Act since 2001. In accordance with the goals of the Infection Protection Act, the recommendations are focused on vaccinations that are most relevant to the protection of public health. The law does not require the commission to perform cost‚Äìbenefit analysis on individual vaccinations. The commission's recommendations are based on a vaccine's risk‚Äìbenefit ratio, evaluating the effectiveness of a vaccine versus any risks posed. The commission has developed criteria to minimize vaccine injuries caused by side effects. German health insurance companies are obligated to cover the cost of any immunizations recommended by the STIKO after they have been reviewed the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). The G-BA generally adopts the commission's recommendations, although minor differences do exist.  Membership  The members of the STIKO are appointed by the Federal Ministry for Health for 3-year terms. The members serve pro bono publico. Members include experts from many scientific disciplines and public health fields and professionals with extensive experience on vaccination. For the period of 2017 through 2020, the commission has the following members: * Chairman: Thomas Mertens, medical director of the Institute for Virology at the University Clinic of Ulm. * Christian Bogdan, director of the Microbiological Institute at the University Clinic of Erlangen * Gerd-Dieter Burchard, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg * Edeltraut Garbe, Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Pr√§ventionsforschung und Epidemiologie, Bremen * Ulrich Heininger, Head doctor of the Pediatric Infectiology and Vaccinology department at the University Children‚Äôs Hospital Basel (Switzerland) * Eva Hummers-Pradier, Director of the Institute for General Medicine at Universit√§tsmedizin G√∂ttingen * Stefanie J.

Biography  Sakisaka was born in ≈åmuta, Fukuoka in 1897. He graduated from University of Tokyo in 1921. When he was a university student, he read Karl Marx‚Äôs writings to study German, and he became a Marxist. He studied in Germany from 1922 to 1925. During the hyperinflation in Germany after World War I, he was able to purchase a lot of Karl Marx‚Äôs writings. After he returned to Japan, he became an assistant professor at Kyushu University. In 1926, he became a professor. He was also known as a coterie of the magazine \\"R≈çn≈ç\\" and an artist and became one of the leading Marxian economists in Japan. When the crackdown against socialism and communism became severe, Sakisaka was resigned with two other professors in 1928. He moved to Tokyo, and involved in compilation and translation of the remodeled \\"Marx Engels complete collection\\". In 1930s, he was active as a representative of the group \\"R≈çn≈ç\\". In 1937 he was arrested and imprisoned in connection with the First Popular Front Incident. After spending bail, speech activity was sealed, translated German books anonymously, and lived self-sufficiently in agriculture. While World War II, many socialists and communists turned for life, he was not able to actively resist the regime, but he was not support the regime. After World War II, socialism and communism movement were made possible again. Sakisaka began to insist that revolution in Japan is Nonviolent revolution, and he returned to Professor of Economics at Kyushu University. After Japan Socialist Party was split in 1950, he established \\"Socialist Association\\" with Hitoshi Yamakawa, and he became a representative theorist of the Leftist Socialist Party. Leftist Socialist Party and Rightist Socialist Party were merged in 1955, but he opposed it. Sakisaka gather lectures and speech activities at universities, lectures on \\"Das Kapital\\" by gathering Socialist Party and labor union activists at home, casually visiting study sessions nationwide and putting emphasis on educating workers. He gradually became a charisma among activists of the \\"Socialist Association\\". Especially he put effort into activist training at the Mitsui Miike coal mine in Fukuoka prefecture, and it was the activists that he fostered the center of the Miike Struggle in 1960. The Miike struggle eventually ended in full defeat by the workers, but his thought began to exert a big influence on socialist activists. From 1960s to 70s, Socialist Association that kept lower activists began to have a great say within the Socialist Party. His sentiment was strongly reflected in the \\"Socialist Association Thesis\\" decided in 1968, which could be said to be the culmination of his socialist thought. From 1960s, he built a relationship with the Soviet Union. He died in 1985.

He was stationed at various locations in central and northern Queensland between 1867 and 1880 conducting regular punitive expeditions against clans of Indigenous Australians who resisted British invasion. He also participated in several surveying expeditions in Far North Queensland, including those under the leadership of George Elphinstone Dalrymple, providing well-armed protection for the British explorers. As a result of being at the frontier of British colonial expansion in this region of Australia, a number of geographical and zoological entities are named after him, such as the Johnstone River and the freshwater crocodile. After resigning from the Native Police in 1880, Johnstone was a police magistrate in various locations around Queensland before he retired from government service in 1891. In his years of duty for the Native Police, Johnstone led many punitive expeditions and \\"dispersals\\". Whilst the activities of the Native Police were consistent with both Government policy and popular expectation, thousands of Aboriginal people were killed or displaced from their traditional lands by the Native Police.  Early life and family history  Robert Arthur Johnstone was born in Richmond, Tasmania in 1843 to parents John Johnstone (alias Johnston Need) and Annie Elizabeth Easton. His paternal grandfather was Lieutenant- General Samuel Need of the 27th/24th regiment of Dragoons who fought for the British Empire mostly in India. Lieutenant-General Need married an Indian woman, most likely the daughter of Saadat Ali Khan II, and had several children with her, one of whom was Robert Johnstone's father. After the death of his wife, Samuel Need returned with his children to Britain and remarried. Due to their Indian heritage and the strong racial prejudices present in English society, the sons were disinherited. One of the sons, Johnston Need, changed his name to John Johnstone, married Annie Easton, and moved to Tasmania in 1835 where Robert was born. It is notable that a number of other Native Police officers, such as Lieutenant John Murray have similar family backgrounds involving Indian grandmothers. In 1850, at the age of seven, Robert Arthur Johnstone was sent to England to be educated at Norwich Grammar School. His father, in the meantime, had remarried and changed residence across Bass Strait to Tower Hill near Warrnambool in the British colony of Victoria. After his schooling, Robert re-joined with his father and siblings at this location in around 1860. During this time Robert claimed that he came in frequent contact with the remnants of the local Aboriginal population (probably the Koroit gundidj clan of the Gunditjmara) and with those residing on the Wannon River. In 1865, at the age of 22, Robert decided to move to Queensland to pursue a career in pastoral land management along the colonial frontier.  Property manager in Mackay region  After an apparently brief period of managing a pastoral property in the Apis Creek area northwest of Rockhampton, Johnstone became property manager of the Greenmount run 10 km west of Mackay in North Queensland. Here he became acquainted with the operations and personnel of the local detachment of Native Police based at Fort Cooper. This government funded paramilitary force had been in existence in various forms throughout British colonised Australia since 1837 and consisted of white officers in command of mounted and armed Aboriginal troopers. The duty of the Native Police was to conduct punitive raids on Aboriginal communities that interfered in colonial expansion. Johnstone became a cadet in this force and was appointed Acting sub-Inspector to the Native Police in 1867. In this year he also married Maria Ann Gibson at Lansdowne near Mackay. Gibson was the daughter of a Royal Navy captain.  Native Police operations around Mackay  Johnstone was based at the Fort Cooper barracks, now known as Nebo, in the ranges to the west of Mackay. One of his first duties was patrolling the north side of the Pioneer River in April 1867, where he encountered several Aboriginal camps, one of which contained more than 200 people. These camps \\"were dealt with in the usual and only effectual mode for restraining their savage propensities\\", which meant indiscriminate shooting of the occupants by Johnstone and his troopers to clear them from the area. The brutal operations of the Native Police were well known throughout the colony and beyond, where troopers would usually \\"make a night attack on the slumbering tribe and generally slay a large number\\". Later in the same year, after some Yuibera men had speared five head of cattle at Koumala, Johnstone chased members of the clan to some islands offshore and when they tried to return to the mainland \\"such a lesson was administered\\" to keep them from \\"committing outrages in that locality\\". In 1868 a large group of Aboriginals killed 7 cattle at Greenmount with Johnstone and his troopers \\"administering a lesson to the blackskins...who richly merit a severe one\\". Also in 1868, Johnstone \\"meted out...the customary chastisement\\" to Aboriginals who were frightening shepherds and livestock at the Cardowan run on the Connors River. Johnstone himself describes in his memoirs other punitive expeditions he led while stationed at Nebo, including that of \\"punishing blacks\\" for the killing of a shepherd at May Downs. When he returned from this mission, he found a group of Aboriginals camped near his barracks. He chased them off and then later tracked them into the ranges where he shot a number of the \\"would-be murderers\\". He also reported how after punishing a group of Aboriginals at Collaroy station on the Connors River, his troopers, while returning to Nebo, were shot at by panic stricken workers at the Tierawoomba station. When taking cover from this unexpected attack, Johnstone found a large Aboriginal weapon- making site in a ravine between Tierawoomba and Blue Mountain. In early 1869, a pastoral squatter by the name of James Collins was killed by Yuibera near Fort Cooper at North Creek. Johnstone and his troopers mustered two local family groups of Aboriginals living in the area and coerced confessions from a number of them by holding family members hostage and tying others to the stirrup irons of their horses and forcing them to run along with the horses. Retributions against those identified were conducted with local squatter Sylvester \\"West\\" Fraser from Grosvenor Downs. Fraser was a survivor of the 1857 Hornet Bank massacre and his brother was the notorious William Fraser who killed many Aboriginals both as a private citizen and as a Native Police officer in the years after the events at Hornet Bank. Although having armed settlers partake in the punitive expeditions of the Native Police was against official orders, Johnstone allowed West Fraser to participate on the \\"promise of secrecy and obedience\\". In fact, it was relatively common for armed civilians to ride with the Native Police on these missions either as volunteers or as special constables. Albert Wright of Avon Downs wrote in his diary that \\"about 60 blacks were shot at Grosvenor Downs\\" as part of the armed excursions following the killing of James Collins. These punitive operations have now become known as the Nebo killings of early 1869. In March of the same year, Johnstone was again out with his troops endeavouring to punish \\"the blacks\\" after the killing of a Chinese shepherd at Mt Heilcalong station near Lake Elphinstone. Property manager at Bellenden Plains Johnstone resigned from the Native Police in 1869. While in the Mackay region, Johnstone had evidently become acquainted with John Ewen Davidson, a sugar planter who had formed plantations in several parts of Queensland. One of these was the Bellenden Plains property north of Cardwell. The Bellenden Plains was an open area of around 600 acres amongst the rainforest on the Murray River of Queensland downstream from the Murray Falls. John Ewen Davidson, however, still remained a co-owner of the property with fellow blackbirder and sugar planter John Raymond Trevelian. In 1869, they appointed Johnstone as property manager to continue the Bellenden Plains project. Johnstone moved to Bellenden Plains with his wife and newborn child. He had numerous violent encounters with the local Dyirbal and Girramay people while re-establishing the property. He went on several punitive missions with his \\"own black-boy\\" and also with the local Native Police led by John Murray. The Kanakas who worked on the cane farm also participated in violent raids against the Aboriginals as part of their duties. Johnstone describes one incident early in his stay where \\"the blacks\\" used their wooden shields as a movable barricade and the cover of smoke from deliberately lit fires in a counter-attack on the property's homestead. Johnstone shot at them continuously from the verandah with multiple firearms pre-loaded by his wife. He \\"followed up\\" the Aboriginals as far as Tam O'Shanter Point with John Murray to punish them. After this experience, he sent his family to reside in Cardwell, while he stayed on at Bellenden Plains with the farmworkers. Johnstone \\"had a lively time of it\\" on the property until it was sold in 1871 to F.J.W. Beardmore. Reappointed to the Native Police Johnstone was reappointed to Acting sub-Inspector in the Native Police in 1871. He was posted at various locations throughout coastal Far North Queensland until his resignation from the force in 1881. Some of the barracks in which he was stationed include Cardwell, Valley of Lagoons Station, Herbert Vale and Fort Herbert near Ingham. During this decade of service, Johnstone was involved in numerous patrols, expeditions and massacres. Descriptions of the most notable are outlined chronologically below. Gould Island killings (January 1872) In January 1872, dugong fishermen Henry Smith and Charles Clements were killed by Aboriginals on Gould Island. Accompanied by a number of local Cardwell squatters including Philip Frederic Sellheim, Johnstone and his troopers scoured the island and nearby Hinchinbrook Island in an expansive punitive mission so that \\"the blacks\\" were \\"taught that what they do is punishable by death\\". When Johnstone returned to Cardwell, another Native Police expedition led by Acting sub-Inspector Crompton went out resulting in further summary punishment. Crompton returned with a number of canoes and three Aboriginal children who were given out to residents of Cardwell as domestic slaves. A person residing in Cardwell at the time described how one of these children, a seven-year-old girl, was raped by a Native Police trooper. The trooper was not punished for this and instead \\"it was mentioned among the Cardwellians as rather a good joke\\". Punitive expeditions after the wreck of the Maria (March 1872) On 26 February 1872, the brig Maria carrying 75 people of a gold prospecting expedition to New Guinea was wrecked upon Bramble Reef. The survivors escaped the sinking ship on 3 boats and 2 rafts. Two of the boats made it safely to the nearest British settlement of Cardwell, but the other three craft were washed up on beaches to the north of the town. Up to ten of these crew members, including the captain, were found to have been killed by Aboriginals residing in this region. Lieutenant Sabine of the Royal Navy happened to be in Cardwell at this time and led a punitive expedition against the Aboriginals who had killed the captain. This mission resulted in the death of at least 8 native people. However, these deaths were deemed insufficient by the local magistrate Brinsley Sheridan, who ordered Johnstone with his troopers \\"to inflict decisive punishment\\". Johnstone was significantly aided by another Royal Navy officer in Captain John Moresby who also had sailed into Cardwell as part of his expedition to New Guinea. Moresby provided additional armed marines and a large schooner for Johnstone to fulfil his mission. Moresby described how Johnstone surprised one camp of Aboriginals with \\"unrestrained ferocity\\", resulting in the massacre of \\"several unfortunate blacks\\". A six-year-old boy was stolen during this raid and taken to England by Moresby. The boy died there from pneumonia three years later. Johnstone and his troopers, together with armed sailors and volunteer riflemen, scoured the coast from Cardwell north to Cooper Point, searching every Aboriginal camp they came across. A member of this party later wrote that Johnstone \\"spoke of killing whole camps, not merely men but girls and piccaninnies\\" during these raids. Johnstone apparently bragged that the Premier of Queensland, Arthur Hunter Palmer, approved of his methods and protected him from any possible recriminations. Newspapers reported that Johnstone's detachment of Native Police killed a total of 93 local Aboriginals in the Maria reprisals. Accusations of mass murder by Johnstone even reached the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, Robert Herbert. A subsequent investigation by the Queensland government condoned Johnstone's actions on the grounds that the Aboriginals of the north were \\"savage and treacherous\\". Wyandotte Station killings (July 1872) A travelling correspondent to the Valley of Lagoons area by the name of Richard Bird Hall wrote several letters to the Queensland Government and to various newspapers about the murderous actions of Johnstone and his troopers. In particular, a massacre of Aboriginals working on Walter Jervoise Scott's Wyandotte run conducted by Johnstone caused a minor scandal. Eight Gugu-Badhun men and two women were killed with most of the corpses \\"left exposed on the roadside till they stank\\". The government and the commissioner of police, David Thompson Seymour, defended Johnstone's actions and he was promoted to full sub-Inspector not long after this. Valley of Lagoons dispersals (1872) During the early 1870s, Johnstone was stationed at various outposts of the massive Valley of Lagoons Station owned by Walter Jervoise Scott. Johnstone describes how the Gugu-Badhun who speared livestock on this property which was once their land were punished in most cases by general massacre. However, he does point out that on one occasion he only shot dead the dogs of the Aboriginals when it was discovered the main target, a man named Tallboy, had previously saved the life of a white man. Herbert River dispersals (February and March 1873) Johnstone reported to Police Commissioner Seymour that on 14 March near Mt Leach \\"I dispersed a large mob and returned to camp...on 21 February I succeeded in dispersing three mobs on the Seaview Range...and on 27 March on the Lower Herbert River I dispersed a large mob.\\" Green Island killings (April and July 1873) In April 1873, the Goodwill vessel arrived at Green Island with 3 European crew and 5 Manbarra people press- ganged from Palm Island to collect and process beche de mer. The Aboriginals, including 3 men and 2 women, resented their treatment and killed two of the whites and stole the \\"Goodwill\\". The third, Daniel Kelly, escaped to nearby Oyster Quay Island to report the killings to another beche-de-mer fisherman named Philip Garland. The incident was reported to authorities in Cardwell and Police Commissioner Seymour ordered Johnstone via telegram to organise a punitive mission. Johnstone and his troopers sailed to the area in their police boat and found the \\"Goodwill\\" abandoned and burnt on a beach in Trinity Bay where the modern-day community of Yarrabah is now located. \\"The blacks were given a proper warm reception\\" when Johnstone arrived and after proceeding inland for 3 miles his troopers dispersed another group of local Yidinji people first by firing on them from a distance and then charging amongst them. Johnstone's section then sailed to the mouth of what is now called the Mulgrave River and dispersed \\"a large mob of blacks\\" with gunfire. They then sailed further south to the Gladys Inlet (which is now known as the Johnstone River) where a large group of Aboriginals led by a very tall man decorated with pipeclay resisted the troopers' approach. Johnstone punished their \\"insolence\\" with gunfire and this leader was one of those killed in the shooting. Johnstone sailed a little further up the river towards its bifurcation, noting the dense jungles and thick soil which could be exploited for sugarcane farming despite the area being populated with Aboriginal people. The Northeast Coast Expedition (September to December 1873) In the latter quarter of 1873, Johnstone accompanied George Elphinstone Dalrymple in his Northeast Coast Expedition funded by the colonial Queensland government. This group was heavily armed with thirteen Native Police troopers assigned to the expedition. After leaving Cardwell and exploring Mourilyan Harbour, they sailed north to Gladys Inlet. Here Dalrymple renamed the river entering the inlet as the Johnstone River after his Native Police travelling companion. The area was well populated with Aboriginals and Johnstone with his troopers forcibly removed them from their camping ground to occupy the site at the junction of the north and south branches. As they sailed up the north branch, the group encountered a major Aboriginal settlement site near where the modern-day town of Daradgee now is. The native people resisted the British encroachment of their locality and Johnstone responded with force against this \\"large mob of blacks\\". Johnstone writes that he and his troopers shot at and \\"dispersed\\" these people on at least three separate occasions over two days. On one of these occasions an Aboriginal man was forced into the river where he was taken by a crocodile. After the indigenous residents were expelled, the British expedition moved into their houses and utilised their facilities, Dalrymple describing how the usual \\"volley from the Sniders\\" were directed at the \\"retreating savages\\". After several days evaluating the potential of clearing this region of thick jungle for exploitation of cash crops such as sugar, the group sailed back to the mouth of the river where Johnstone dispersed another group of Aboriginals at Coquette Point. The expedition then sailed north to Trinity Bay and camped on Double Island. Needing water, Johnstone noticed the smoke from an Aboriginal beach camp on the mainland at a place now known as Palm Cove and he and his troopers proceeded there in the police boat to obtain the water that supplied the Aboriginals. Johnstone shot a large number of Aboriginals at Palm Cove while removing them from their residence with Dalrymple reporting that the \\"Sniders opened up on them\\" as the troopers proceeded up the beach and \\"we all heartily rejoiced at the severe lesson\\" that was handed out to the native occupants. After this, the expedition sailed north to the Endeavour River where the land was quickly deemed unsuitable for agriculture. Whilst at anchor during the day, a local Aboriginal man was spotted taking a survey flag that was set up on a sandbank in the river. For this action, Johnstone, his troopers and others aboard the ship opened fire on this man who managed to escape despite many rounds being fired at him. The troopers \\"were wild to go over for the purpose of teaching the myalls better behaviour\\" but the follow up punitive mission failed to find any Aboriginal camps to commit massacre upon. The expedition briefly returned to Cardwell before heading north again to another river inlet which Dalrymple named the Mulgrave River. Again this area was found to be heavily populated by Aboriginals with numerous gunyah style houses, rafts and canoes observed along the banks. Johnstone and a number of troopers set out from here and managed to climb to the summit of Mount Bellenden Ker. At Constantine Point at the mouth of the Mulgrave River, Johnstone raided a large gunyah and stole the mummified remains of an Aboriginal woman from it. Dalrymple, who regarded the native people as \\"the very lowest type of human formation\\", made Johnstone leave two blankets and a tomahawk for \\"the bereaved relatives, who would doubtless rightly appreciate the exchange\\". The preserved corpse was given to the Museum of Brisbane. The expedition then travelled to rivers further to the north which Dalrymple named the Mossman River and the Daintree River. The final leg of their journey in December involved returning south to Cardwell. Along the way, they again stopped at the mouth of the Johnstone River where Johnstone and his troopers were involved in another dispersal of Aboriginals who were punished with bullets for digging up the remains of crew members from the Maria shipwreck. Albert and Edward incident (June 1874) The crew of a sugar trading cutter by the name of Albert and Edward which anchored in Challenger Bay off Palm Island, kidnapped some local Aboriginal women for sexual purposes. In response, the vessel was attacked by Palm Island men, who attempted to burn down the ship and kill the captain and the mate. Despite newspaper reports describing the attack as a \\"murderous outrage\\", both sailors were only wounded and escaped to report the incident at Cardwell. Johnstone was sent to Palm Island to punish the natives. On arriving there he found that the islanders had not run away because they thought they would all be shot if found in other localities. Johnstone demanded they give up the ringleaders otherwise \\"everyone will be punished\\". He decided not to indiscriminately kill the islanders on this occasion considering the kidnapping of the women, but told them they would be punished in the future if a similar attack on whites occurred. Seymour River dispersal (January 1875) After \\"the blacks\\" had robbed a hut at Dalrymple's Gap, sub-Inspectors Johnstone and Burrowes and their troopers tracked them to the coast at Seymour River estuary where they were \\"dispersed\\". Retribution after the Conn killings (April 1875) British settler William Conn and his wife were killed by Aboriginals on their selection near what is now the modern town of Bemerside. For three days, Johnstone and his troopers ransacked all the native camps they could find in the mountains around the immediate region and tracked a group of Aboriginals to the coast where they shot some of the men and captured some of the women. Another group \\"got their just deserts\\" when they were killed trying to flee to Hinchinbrook Island. After going to Cardwell to obtain some re-inforcements, Johnstone returned to the area and went on another punitive mission \\"until we caught them\\". Founding of Cairns (1876) Up until 1876, the area around what is now Cairns was simply known to the British either as Trinity Bay or Smith's Landing. It was also known as Battle Camp after beche-de-mer fisherman Philip Garland killed a number of Aboriginals there while stealing a canoe. In 1876, Johnstone with other Native Police officers in Alexander Douglas-Douglas and George Townsend, aided in the creation of a track from the Hodgkinson goldfields to the coast where Battle Camp became a port for the miners. This port was later named Cairns. In the same expedition, Johnstone sailed into the river to the north of Cairns, naming it the Barron River. He walked through the rocky areas and went as far as the Barron Falls, noting that the local Aboriginals were constantly indicating (from a safe distance) for his exploring group to go away. Chilcott Islet and Dunk Island killings (February 1877) Captain Thomas Harris of the schooner Douglas pressganged three Aboriginals from the Dunk Island area to work as slave labour loading guano and beche-de-mer from Chilcott Islet. The Aboriginals rebelled and killed four of the crew when they arrived at the islet. Two of the Dunk Islanders were also killed during the incident but the remaining one, a man by the name of Dungaree, escaped by swimming to a nearby island. He was later picked up and transported to Sydney for trial. Summary collective punishment for Aboriginals on Dunk Island had been previously planned as \\"the Dunk Island blacks have long had a bad name, and recently a certain native police officer [Johnstone] was desirous of proceeding there and rooting them out because of their murderous propensities\\". Ominously, Johnstone himself describes a later patrol on Dunk Island as unnecessary as he \\"knew there was no blacks furthermore on this island.\\" Dungaree was acquitted in Sydney but was forced to become a Native Police trooper under the command of Johnstone. After several years in the Native Police, Dungaree was advised by Johnstone that he could return to his tribe but \\"if ever they murdered a white man we would return and shoot all the men\\". Dungaree decided to stay in the force, but was killed not long after by \\"Burdekin blacks\\". The Riser killings (1878) The two man crew of the cutter Riser were found dead, supposedly killed by Aboriginals, after their vessel was wrecked near Sisters Island. Johnstone and troopers scoured the South Barnard Islands and along the mainland around Kurrimine Beach for Aboriginals. He \\"searched the camps..punished the murderers\\" and returned to his barracks at Cardwell. Tam O'Shanter Point incident (November 1879) Two white brothers who were robbed of their belongings and horses by around \\"40 male blacks\\" at Tam O'Shanter Point, reported the incident to Johnstone. He and troopers went out after them and Johnstone had the matter \\"satisfactorily seen to\\". Molonga cattle property The area that had been used for the Native Police barracks at Palm Creek just east of Ingham became the property of Johnstone when he retired from the Native Police in 1881. He called the property \\"Molonga\\" which somewhat appropriately meant \\"Devil\\" in a local Indigenous language. Interestingly, the term Molonga was later used by Aboriginal people in western Queensland such as the Pitta Pitta to describe a corroborree depicting a white spirit who would cause havoc and steal young girls away. Johnstone utilised Molonga for cattle grazing, but later it was sold and became a famous lychee plantation. One of Johnstone's daughters, Ruby, continued the tradition of naming properties Molonga. She and her husband gave this title to their house in the Brisbane suburb of Graceville and Molonga Terrace in Graceville exists today where the property once was. She also called her beachside land at Burleigh Heads by the name of Molonga. This land was sold off and subdivided in the 1920s. Amateur naturalist Throughout his career as a Native Police officer, Johnstone had the opportunity to collect plant and animal specimens that had not been seen by Europeans before. Probably the most notable was the freshwater crocodile which he found in abundance around the headwaters of the Herbert River. Johnstone sent the preserved remains of one to zoologist Gerard Krefft, who gave the scientific name Crocodilus johnstoni to the species in honour of Johnstone.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Johnstone, R. A.\\", p. 136). Promotion to Police Magistrate In 1881, Johnstone was promoted to Police Magistrate and posted at Winton. Here he broke his kneecap while riding and was transferred to Cooktown as a clerk of petty sessions in 1882. After a brief period back in Ingham as police magistrate and inspector of Pacific Islanders, he was transferred to Bundaberg as police magistrate there until 1887. From 1887 til 1891 he was police magistrate for the Maryborough region. In 1891, Johnstone retired from public service and in 1896 moved near to one of his married daughters in Beenleigh. In the early 1900s, Johnstone moved to the Brisbane suburb of Toowong. Spinifex and Wattle autobiography By the early years of the 20th century the policy of the Queensland government towards Aboriginals had switched from one of violent repression to a system of control and incarceration. Archibald Meston, a government appointed Protector of Aborigines, started to publicly criticise the methods of the Native Police. These criticisms were acknowledged and publicly refuted by Johnstone. Johnstone wrote a series of autobiographical articles for The Queenslander newspaper giving details of his career in the Native Police. These were originally published in that paper in the years 1903 to 1905 and later were collated and published in book form in 1984. Death and Legacy Late in his life, Johnstone moved into a house on Archer Street in the Brisbane suburb of Toowong. He died here on 16 January 1905 and is buried at Toowong cemetery. He had nine children and some of his daughters married into notable families in Queensland society. His second daughter married one of the sons of Sidney Yeates a prominent landowner at Adavale. His third daughter married into the orchard owning Mullett family of Monduran, while his eldest married Edgar Young a prominent Beenleigh resident. While having the Johnstone River and the scientific term for the freshwater crocodile being named after him, a tragic aspect of Johnstone's legacy was his role in the destruction of Aboriginal society in northern Queensland.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The first development in what is now Linden was the construction of a dam in the early 1830s. In 1837, a bridge and tavern were constructed in what is now the historic district. By 1840, the town had two mills, a hotel, and other commercial structures. In about 1845 the mills burned, and new mills, including what is now the Linden Mill, were built. Manufacturers moved in during the 1850s, and the commercial section of Linden prospered. The first brick building appeared in 1865, and a bank in 1871. It was not until the 1800s, however, that the downtown development hit high gear. The number of commercial buildings in the downtown tripled between 1880 and 1890, with street lamps and sidewalks added in the early 1890s. Unfortunately, Linden was hard hit by the Great Depression, losing nearly all of the industry in the area. The village never regained the economic strength it had had in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The streetscapes in the district remained much as they were until the turn of the 21st century. In 2007, a fire broke out in the Union Block on the corner of Broad and Bridge, and the building was eventually razed. Description The Bridge Street-Broad Street Historic District contains 43 primarily commercial buildings, of which 35 contribute to the historic character of the neighborhood. Most of the buildings were built between 1850 and 1925. The district is primarily commercial in nature, with a majority of the buildings being brick Italianate commercial blocks. However, there are also ten wood frame residential structures of Greek Revival or Queen Anne styling. In addition, there are two former residential structures that have been converted to commercial use, two churches, the village hall, the Board of Education Building, and the former Linden Mill, now converted into the village library.

He was editor of medical journals, medical text books and a university lecturer.  Early life and education  Hillel Abbe ShapiroHillel Shapiro's parents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to Cape Town, South Africa, and he was born and grew up in Somerset Strand where he attended Somerset West High School in the Cape Provence. Yiddish was the only language spoken by his parents, so Shapiro had to learn English and Afrikaans and he became fluent in both. After school matriculation, his linguistic interests led to him studying Latin and English at the University of Cape Town, graduating BA with distinction in English. After this first degree, he studied for an MA in ethnology, social anthropology and archaeology, receiving first class passes in all these subjects, as well as the class medal in ethnology and archaeology and he worked at the False Bay coast on the excavation of kitchen middens at Gordon's Bay. With a growing interest in archaeology, he enrolled on courses in human anatomy and biology. The Head of the Department of Zoology was Lancelot Hogben who suggested to Shapiro that his journey into biology would be more successful with a knowledge of physics and chemistry; so in 1930 Shapiro enrolled on the first year of the medical course. He began biological experimentation while still a first-year medical student. By feeding thyroid glands to tadpoles, he observed the accelerated metamorphosis induced by this endocrine gland. As a result of his research work carried out during the fifth year of medical study, he was in 1935 awarded the Science Research Scholarship of the Royal Commission (the 1851 Exhibition Science Research Scholarship). From the Archives of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 reference number RC/13/A/3/110: He left his medical training in South Africa to come to London to take up the scholarship. He started off at the London School of Economics and then moved to the National Institute for Medical Research, under the guidance of Sir Henry Dale. He worked on ‚Äúthe Endocrine basis of motor behaviour with special reference to the mating reflex: extension of this work to mammals including man‚Äù and ‚ÄúChanges in the human vaginal epithelium associated with ovulation and with pre-pubertal, adult and post-menopausal alterations in the sexual cycle.‚Äù In Feb 1937 he returned to Cape Town to hold the remaining time of his scholarship there, as his father had unexpectedly died and he needed to support his mother. He had also brought a supply of South African toads with him to London but he had almost run out of these and there would be a better supply in South Africa. The Commission's Ninth Report to Parliament (RC/F/3/1/11) shows that there was usually one scholarship per annum awarded to South Africa in the 1930s. He was the first South African medical student to be awarded this Science Research Scholarship. He undertook research at the Medical Research Council laboratories in London, under the guidance of the Nobel laureate Sir Henry Dale.  Research  His medical training was a route into experimental physiology. His mentor Lancelot Hogben influenced him to pursue research. He was also guided by the advice of Harry Zwarenstein, with whom he was later to co-operate in developing the Xenopus Frog Pregnancy Test. But his initial research was into amphibian metabolism, with his Ph.D. awarded in 1933 for 'Studies in the calcium metabolism of the amphibian'. = Xenopus laevis Pregnancy Test controversy = The use of live South African female Xenopus frogs was common in Europe, the USA and Australia from the 1930s and through the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s for testing human pregnancy. This early pregnancy test had been developed by Shapiro and Zwarenstein and it worked by injecting the urine from a human female into the Xenopus laevis frog - the frog would ovulate if the urine had come from a pregnant woman. In a report to the Royal Society of South Africa in October 1933, Shapiro and Zwarenstein announced that in the previous month they had successfully used Xenopus in 35 pregnancy tests. The following spring Nature carried their report. (Shapiro and Zwarenstein, 1933). In addition, the test was used to diagnose chorion epithelioma and testicular tumours. The Shapiro-Zwarenstein pregnancy test received international recognition and Xenopus laevis frogs were exported all over the world from the Cape. The 16 November 1946 edition of the British Medical Journal includes a letter to the BMJ from Shapiro and Zwarenstein clarifying that Hogben and his associates were retrospectively wrongly claiming credit for discovering the pregnancy test first. On pages 45 and 46 of a review titled ‚ÄòThe introduction of Xenopus laevis into developmental biology: of empire, pregnancy testing and ribosomal genes‚Äô by John B. Gurdon of the Wellcome CRC Institute and Nick Hopwood of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, the authors elaborate on this controversy in detail: From page 46 of their review: 'In a preliminary report to the Royal Society of South Africa in October 1933, Shapiro and Zwarenstein announced that in the previous month they had successfully used Xenopus in 35 pregnancy tests. The following May 1934 Nature carried an excerpt from this report (Shapiro and Zwarenstein, 1933) '. From page 45: 'Hogben's communication (1930) would later be taken to have shown in principle that Xenopus might be used as an indicator of the presence of gonadotrophins in the urine of pregnant women, but neither this nor the full report (Hogben et al., 1931) mentioned pregnancy testing. He appears initially to have had other priorities, and it was at the outset far from clear that it would prove possible to make Xenopus the test animal of choice.' Edward Elkin attributed the pregnancy test to a number of researchers. Jesse Olszynko-Gryn, in his 'Pregnancy testing in Britain, c.1900-67 : laboratories, animals and demand from doctors, patients and consumers', investigated the controversy in detail  Career  On returning from London, Shapiro was employed as government pharmacologist of the Biological Control Laboratories at the Union Health Department in Cape Town. In 1939, he interrupted this employment to complete his medical studies, graduating M.B. Ch.B. in December that year. He then moved to the health department's medico-legal laboratories as a forensic pathologist and in October 1943 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of South Africa and was a lecturer in medical jurisprudence at Cape Town University until1948, when he left to take up the editorship of the South African Medical Journal. He chaired numerous medical conferences and symposiums, including from 13 to 16 July 1968, the first Human Heart Transplantation Symposium in Cape Town that followed on soon after the first heart transplant had successfully been done by Christiaan Barnard on 3 December 1967. The latter part of his career mostly involved editing medical journals, consultant and expert witness work in criminal trials, and appearing for the surviving families in inquests into suspicious deaths of detainees in police custody during the Apartheid years.  Family  Shapiro was married to educational psychologist Sonia Machanick, founder of Japari School, and they had four children, Janice, Paul, Roy and Ian. Together with his wife and a group of other parents, he was a founder of South Africa's first multi-racial high school, Woodmead School, which his two younger children then attended. Politically, he was a supporter of Helen Suzman and the Progressive Party (South Africa).

The episode aired on October 1, 2018 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. Plot Jimmy and Kim successfully work a scam to replace the approved plans for the Mesa Verde bank branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building without going through the city government's lengthy refiling process. On their way back to Albuquerque, Jimmy talks of getting reinstated to the bar the next day, and using their combined abilities for more scams, but Kim counsels caution. Jimmy attends his reinstatement hearing and answers the committee's questions. One member throws him off at the end by asking why he wants to practice law and who inspired him; Jimmy pauses a bit at both but still provides eloquent answers. They tell him that they will let him know the results by mail in a few days, but Jimmy becomes nervous after he leaves and waits near the hearing room. When the committee leaves, he finds out from their secretary that they have denied his reinstatement. When Jimmy confronts the panel's chairman, he tells Jimmy that some of his answers were insincere, and he can apply for reinstatement again in a year. Kim and Jimmy meet in the parking garage of S&C;'s office building and Jimmy complains about how he was treated during the hearing. Kim identifies the problem, and points out that Jimmy never mentioned Chuck in his last two answers; since his dispute with Chuck was the reason for his suspension, the panel members considered his answers to be less than genuine. Jimmy gets defensive about his relationship with Chuck, and argues with Kim. He accuses Kim of \\"slumming\\" with him any time she needs a favor or wants to run a con, and says she sees him only as \\"Slippin' Jimmy\\". Kim angrily points out that she has been Jimmy's biggest supporter since they first met, and has helped him recover from all his mistakes. That night, Jimmy returns to Kim's apartment and wordlessly starts packing his belongings. He admits he screwed up at the hearing and damaged their relationship, and Kim asks if he still wants to be a lawyer. He says he does, and Kim says she will help make it happen. Lalo and Nacho visit Hector, who has been transferred to a nursing home, and communicates only by moving the index finger of his right hand. Lalo reminds Hector of the time he burned down a hotel and killed its owner after the owner, a former college professor, treated Hector disrespectfully. He reveals he kept a souvenir ‚Äî a concierge bell from the front desk. He ties the bell to Hector's wheelchair, allowing Hector to communicate more effectively. Lalo asks Nacho to step away while he talks to Hector about Gus and then asks Nacho to take him to Los Pollos Hermanos so he can meet Gus in person. Gus acts happy to meet Lalo, but gives Nacho an angry glare, and Nacho can only look back apologetically. Lalo tells Gus that the Salamancas are appreciative of Gus' efforts to save Hector and postulates that perhaps Don Eladio wants continued bad blood between Gus and the Salamancas in order to preserve his own position. Lalo suggests that perhaps Gus and the Salamancas should cooperate more closely, but Gus states he is happy with the current arrangements. Lalo then takes back his original statement, replying that the Salamancas would never really do anything to injure their relationship with Eladio. Lalo asks Nacho to take him to Gus' chicken farm so he can see the location where the Salamancas pick up their drugs after Gus' trucks bring the shipments over the border. Werner and his crew prepare to blast the rock preventing construction of the elevator in the meth lab under the laundry. When the pre-firing test fails, Werner traces the electrical wire for one of the charges. While in the construction area, he suffers a panic attack before finding a splice that has come apart. He repairs it, returns to the rest of the crew, and pretends there's nothing wrong, though his hands are shaking behind his back. Tyrus drives a semi-truck over a pothole outside the laundry in a move timed to coincide with the detonation, which masks its sound and shock. Werner's crew celebrates the successful blast, knowing the end of their longer than expected job is in sight. Werner admits to Mike that he misses his wife and asks if it's possible to fly to Germany for a weekend, and then come back to finish the work. Instead, Mike offers Werner a longer than usual phone call with his wife, which Werner accepts. After the call, Werner returns to his housing unit, but looks around the warehouse at the video cameras. When Mike receives his morning report from the on duty security team the next day, he notices a few monitors show displays with dead pixels. He and his team check the warehouse, and find that Werner used a laser to temporarily disable the cameras by increasing their voltage, creating a flash effect of several seconds that permitted him to move through the warehouse undetected. He then used a hacksaw blade to cut through the padlocks for the doors leading to the roof, and escaped by climbing down the building's maintenance ladder. Production \\"Wiedersehen\\" includes the origin story for Hector Salamanca's bell, an item vitally important to the storylines of both Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad. In addition, it provides backstory details about the character Lalo, who was first named in Breaking Bad, and first appeared in the Better Call Saul episode \\"Coushatta\\". In German, \\"Wiedersehen\\" is literally translated as \\"see you again\\" or \\"until we see each other again\\", and the expression \\"auf Wiedersehen\\" is used to indicate \\"goodbye\\" or \\"farewell\\". In this episode, Werner's crew have spray painted the word \\"Wiedersehen\\" on the rock they need to blast to make room for the elevator in the underground meth lab, in effect saying \\"goodbye\\" to the obstacle that's put them behind schedule. \\"Wiedersehen\\" can also be understood as a reference to Werner's escape, since he is effectively saying goodbye to his crew, to Mike, and to the job of supervising the meth lab's construction.

The episode aired on October 8, 2018 on AMC, in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. It is tied with \\"Something Unforgivable\\" for being the two longest episodes in the series at 60 minutes. This episode marks the final appearance of Michael McKean (Chuck McGill). Plot =Opening= In a flashback to 1998, Chuck provides the ritual introduction and stands beside Jimmy as Jimmy is inducted into the New Mexico bar. Kim joins Jimmy and Chuck and other HHM employees at a karaoke bar to celebrate. Chuck is about to leave but a drunken Jimmy convinces Chuck to stay and join him for karaoke with \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" by ABBA. Chuck helps Jimmy home and to bed. They both drift off to sleep, repeating the song they sang together at the bar. =Main story= In 2004, Mike arranges a search party to locate Werner Ziegler, while he tries to track down Werner through a money wire agency by pretending to be Werner's brother-in-law and convincing the clerk to let him look at the security camera footage. After confirming that Werner had been there, Mike meets with Gus and shows him the note Werner left indicating he would be gone for four days to be with his wife, and would return to complete the work on the meth lab. Gus confirms that Werner's wife is due at the Denver International Airport within the day. Mike convinces Gus to let him try to find Werner and make him return rather than kill him. While reviewing the transcript of the last call Werner made to his wife from the warehouse, Mike discovers that he is likely going to a local hot spring, and begins calling hotels near facilities in the New Mexico area. Lalo stakes out Gus' chicken farm, where he sees Gus, Victor, and Tyrus leaving to search for Werner. He follows and observes the meeting between Gus and Mike. He tails Mike as Mike continues to search for Werner, but Mike notices the car that's following him and evades it. Lalo goes back to the money wire agency where he saw Mike meet with Gus, but the clerk refuses to give him any information, so he kills the clerk and reviews the security camera footage that shows Mike picking up tourist pamphlets for the hot springs. Lalo calls hotels until he locates Werner and then places a call to him in which Lalo pretends to work for Gus, enabling him to extract some details of Werner's work on the \\"superlab\\" before Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call. Mike takes Werner to a remote site and calls Gus to inform him of Lalo's activities. Gus realizes that Lalo knows about Werner and can trace his work back to Gus, so he intends to send men to kill Werner, but Mike persuades Gus to let him do it. Mike has Werner call his wife at the airport and convince her to return to Germany, then assures him that his men will be sent home without incident. He also promises to make Werner's death look like an accident and ensure there's a believable story for authorities to accept, so that his wife will know he died but won't wonder how or why. Werner walks off to look up at the stars and Mike shoots him. Later, Mike meets Gus at the construction site, which Gus is showing to Gale, and it is revealed that the underground meth \\"superlab\\" has been created in accordance with Gale's design. On the anniversary of Chuck's death, Jimmy and Kim place \\"in memoriam\\" ads in the local newspapers. Jimmy then spends the day feigning mourning at Chuck's gravesite as several of Chuck's former associates visit it. Later that day, Howard holds a celebration to dedicate a law library reading room in Chuck's name, at which he announces HHM's recovery from its recent setbacks. The reading room was paid for by an anonymous donor, but Kim and Drama Girl, who's working as a server at the catered event, reveal to the guests as gossip the fact that Jimmy was the anonymous donor. Kim has Jimmy use these events to his advantage prior to the reinstatement appeal, hoping to influence the panel by showing that despite how he appeared during his first hearing, Jimmy is actually grief-stricken over Chuck's death. Later, Jimmy and Howard sit on a panel reviewing potential candidates for scholarships in Chuck's name. Jimmy focuses on Christy, a student whose background includes a shoplifting charge when she was younger, and tries unsuccessfully to persuade the other board members to award her a scholarship. He follows her out to give her the bad news, and tells her the results were predetermined because the wealthy and powerful will never look past her mistake. He uses the same phrase Chuck used to cut ties with him - that she's \\"not all that important\\" to them - and encourages her not to stick to the straight and narrow path she is trying to follow, but to cut corners and do whatever is necessary to succeed because \\"the winner takes it all\\". In the parking garage afterward, Jimmy's car won't start and he weeps uncontrollably out of frustration for Christy's situation, recognizing the similarities between her circumstances and his. When Jimmy returns home, Kim is preparing a speech for Jimmy to use at his appeal, and he makes the same point about himself that he made to Christy about her situation - that no matter how hard he tries to overcome his past, the people with wealth and power won't let him. At his appeal hearing, Jimmy begins to use Chuck's last letter to him as part of his argument, but stops midway and gives a seemingly impromptu speech about his remorse for Chuck's death, how much Chuck influenced his decision to pursue the law as a career, and how hard he'll work to be worthy of the McGill name if he's reinstated. Jimmy's speech earns visibly emotional expressions from the panel and from Kim. He wins reinstatement and then stuns Kim by revealing that his speech was actually an insincere performance. When the panel's secretary arrives to lead Jimmy to the office where he'll fill out the paperwork so he can regain his law license, he asks for a doing business as form and states his intention not to practice law under the name \\"McGill\\". As he walks down the hall, an even more shocked Kim asks Jimmy what he's doing. He briefly turns around to face her and says \\"S'all good, man!\\" Production \\"Winner\\" was written by Peter Gould and Thomas Schnauz. It was directed by Adam Bernstein, who also directed the episodes \\"Five-O\\", \\"Gloves Off\\", and \\"Slip\\". This episode includes guest appearances from Michael McKean as Chuck and Brandon K. Hampton as Ernesto, both of whom appear in the flashback. In Episode 1 of Season 1 (\\"Uno\\"), Jimmy displays his post-meeting frustration with Howard by kicking a dented trash can located inside the doorway between the HHM office building and parking garage, causing it further damage. Reception \\"Winner\\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it garnered a perfect 100% rating with an average score of 9.1/10 based on 19 reviews. The site's critical consensus is, \\"An excellent ending to a bittersweet season, 'Winner' ties up loose threads while priming each of Better Call Sauls excellently drawn characters for the coming danger.\\" The episode received nominations at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Bob Odenkirk, Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Jonathan Banks, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for Peter Gould and Thomas Schnauz and Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Michael McKean. =Ratings= \\"Winner\\" was watched by 1.53 million viewers on its first broadcast, earning a 0.5 ratings for viewers between 18 and 49.

The current holder of the trophy is Nathan Harrison. Nathan Harrison descends Bray Hill on his way to victory in the 2019 Senior Manx Grand Prix History By the early 1920s, the Isle of Man TT Races had become established as the premier motorcycle races in the world. This led to questions regarding the future of the meeting, with concern for their continuance on the Isle of Man, as it was felt that the meeting could be transferred to England. Arthur Crookall was a strong supporter of the establishment of a supplementary race meeting on the Isle of Man to be held for amateur competitors, to be run over the existing Snaefell Mountain Course and to serve as a backup in the case of the Auto-Cycle Union making a decision to transfer the TT Races. A successful businessman, Crookall decided to donate the trophy as first prize in what was initially called the Manx Amateur Road Races, and which continued as such until 1930 when it was renamed the Manx Grand Prix. The first person to win the trophy was Les Randles. The A.B. Crookall Trophy is presented to the winner of the Senior Manx Grand Prix, the premier race of the meeting and which is run as the finale of the racing programme.

He killed 12 people in southern Finland between October and November in 1849. He has been characterized as the first serial killer in Finland.  Biography  Juhani Aataminpoika left home at the age of 15, living a nomadic life and conducting small crimes. In October 1849, he was charged for stealing horses and imprisoned. During his imprisonment, he was taken from the H√§meenlinna prison to Hauho, where the court was to be held on his crimes. During the transportation, he escaped, starting a homicidal spree. In Lammi he killed the master and mistress of the Helisev√§ croft with a man named Kustaa Kratula. From there, he went back to his home in Heinola, where he killed his father and mother and their children before fleeing to the forest. Shortly afterwards, he killed a man to get his certificate to get a job at a canal site. Juhani Aataminpoika travelled to the Saimaa Canal, killing more people on the way. He didn't stay at the canal work site and slayed a sailor in order to get his papers. At the beginning of November, Aataminpoika had returned to Lammi, from where he left with his friend Antti Suikko to go to the Tyry croft in the village of Hattelmala. The men trashed the house, stealing their money and maiming the tenants. The old mistress of the house died later from her injuries but the others managed to survive the attack. Shortly thereafter, on 20 November, Juhani Aataminpoika was caught in Palsa near Lammi and Padasjoki border. At the end of the trial following the recapture, the Vyborg Court of Appeal sentenced him to death. The sentence was upheld in the Senate's Department of Justice, but the Emperor commuted it to 40 lashes and a life imprisonment sentence. He was transferred in January 1853 to Suomenlinna and was kept there as chained to the wall until his death in 1854. Juhani Aataminpoika was also known by nickname \\"Kerpeikkari\\", which means 'executioner'. He was famous for his own time, but his actions were forgotten for a long time and he did get the same fame as for example Matti Haapoja. In the 2000s, however, he became an interest for researchers.  Film  A film about Juhani Aataminpoika's story is planned. The script is written by Kari Hietalahti, and the film is directed by Peter Franz√©n. If the film is financed, it would be released in autumn 2017.

The library was built in 1934 for Leyton Urban District Council, and is now managed by the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The building's ground floor is let out to retail units with the library on the floor above, which allowed for the construction of a much larger building than would have otherwise been possible. This makes Leytonstone Library an early example of a library being constructed as part of multi-function buildings with both municipal and commercial services, according to Historic England who describe it as \\"a suburban branch library of considerable architectural ambition \\". Crest above library entrance The front of the building and its entrance lobby, however, was still built in a grand art deco style under the instruction of librarian of the borough, Edward Sydney, with the intention that it should \\"reflect the pride of the local authority in its library service\\". During the Second World War, The British Ministry of Information commissioned a series of photographs of the library's interior showing patrons freely browsing the catalogues for use in war propaganda to show a stark contrast with Nazi book-burning, making the library a symbol of freedom and democracy. Following a ¬£ investment from Waltham Forest Borough Council and an 11-month closure ending in September 2015, the library's facilities now include a theatre hall, upgraded ICT facilities and faster wi-fi, and dedicated sections for adults, teens and children.

It was built from 1820 to 1826 by Thomas Laycock. It is also known as Retreat Farm, The Retreat, Thomas Laycock's Cottage Vale and Cottage-ville. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Traditional owners of this country were the Cabrogal (Cahbrogal) clan (land around Liverpool), the Murigong (Muringong) clan (land at the Cowpastures), the Warmuli (land around Prospect) and the Gomerigal people (land around South Creek). Bringelly is an Aboriginal name, one of only two in the Liverpool district. Kelvin Park estate's history is bound up with several grants of land including those of 600 acres to Thomas Laycock Jr. (soldier, explorer, businessman, farmer),Portion 22, 600 acres, granted 26/11/1818 Penelope Lucas (governess to John Macarthur and Elizabeth Macarthur and family, Parramatta),Portion 23, 500 acres, 26/11/1818 William Hutchinson,Portion 17, 700 acres, 30/6/1823 Edmund Wright,Portion 16, 350 acres, 5/4/1821 and Charles Reid.Portion 21, 600 acres, 26/11/1818 In 1824, Laycock's 1200 acre \\"Retreat Farm\\" was sold to Edward Riley, and resold within a month to Provost Marshall John Thomas Campbell (Governor Macquarie's secretary prior to 1819), who tried again to sell it.Form Architects, 2005 Liston (2010) notes that Laycock Junior's South Creek estate was known as \\"Cottage Vale\\", later called \\"The Retreat\\", and \\"Kelvin\\". She adds that Campbell was a successful farmer and pastoralist, breeding cattle and horses and in 1826 was a member of the NSW Land Board, responsible for assessing the resources of prospective settlers who applied for land grants. Campbell died in 1830.Liston, 2010, 6 A lease was given to the Board of Directors of the newly formed Australian Agricultural Company in early 1825 to accommodate its newly appointed Director, Robert Dawson and the large party of workers and flock of merino sheep who'd accompanied him to the colony. (Campbell was a shareholder in the AA Company). The Company was formed in 1824 to \\"extend and improve the flocks of merino sheep\\" in NSW. In 1824, London was in the midst of an enormous stock market boom. With Australian wool becoming increasingly important, two companies - the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo.) and the Van Diemen's Land Company - were floated on the London Stock Exchange to promote raising fine-wooled sheep in the Australian colonies. The AACo. became a major force in the Australian coal and pastoral industries and in the settlement and development of the Hunter River and Port Stephens regions. Today, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, it is the oldest Australian company operating under its original name. Founded by a special Act of Parliament and under Royal Charter, it acquired the right to hold and sell land in New South Wales. Its founding members were a group of British bankers, merchants and politicians who saw the potential for big profits to be made in the colony. The terms of the charter were that most of the labour would be provided by convicts under the supervision of superintendents, overseers and skilled mechanics sent from England. If, at the end of 15 years, the company had expended 10,000 pounds on improvements and employed 1400 convicts, it would obtain freehold title to its land. The size of the land grant was not specified in the charter, but discussions between the company directors and the Colonial Office settled on one million acres. The company appointed a chief agent, Robert Dawson and a Colonial Committee to assist him. This eventually included just three people - James Macarthur (fourth son of John Macarthur), his cousin Hannibal Macarthur and his brother-in-law, Principal Surgeon, James Bowman. The committee took a four-year lease of \\"The Retreat\\" (later 'Kelvin') at Bringelly near Camden for the immediate accommodation of imported stock, and sought advice on the best location for the land grant. In June 1825 Dawson sailed from the Isle of Wight with 27 employees and their wives and families, 800 French and Anglo merino sheep, 8 cattle and 6 horses. They were followed a few weeks later by an overseer, 6 shepherds and a further 79 French merinos. In January 1826, when people and stock were settled, Dawson sailed to Newcastle with a small party on the \\"Liverpool Packet\\" and from there, they travelled across country to inspect Port Stephens, an area which, of all those suggested, had the great advantage of access by water.Pemberton, 2009, 57-58 Temporary huts were added to the house on the farm to accommodate the worker families. Within two months he moved most of the party to Carrington, near Port Stephens, but the Company continued to use the Retreat Farm for stock agistment. Imported thoroughbred and Cleveland stallions were stood at stud at Retreat Farm in 1826. Sheep were sent to it in 1827 with German shepherds. The farm continued to be leased to the AA Company from 1826 --30. In 1831 Campbell's brother Reverend C. Campbell, heir to the estate on John Campbell's death, let the farm for a year, and in 1832 approved its auction. In 1833 Alfred Kennerley (landholder, philanthropist, later Premier of Tasmania) bought it, using it as a base for stock agistment and operating his other properties at Parramatta and Mudgee. He returned to England in 1842 and in 1845 sold his stock and leased his land holdings. He returned and is thought to have actively farmed \\"Retreat Farm\\". In 1853 he sold the farm to David Bell. In 1857 and again in 1862 it was mortgaged to Rowland Hassall. Bell was insolvent in 1864 and 1325 acres (including part of Lucas' grant to the north) were sold to Frederick Borton. About this time a store and dwelling known as the Bringelly Post Office and a public pound and blacksmith's shop had been built on the extreme (southwestern) boundary of the estate, and the junction of Bringelly, Penrith, Camden and Greendale Roads. In 1869 William Pearce of Seven Hills bought the farm, and 1872 records show he lived there, as well as farmer Frank Horsey. In 1896 land on \\"The Retreat\\"s southern boundary was resumed to build Bringelly Road, and at its southwest corner for the Northern Road and a school, which was operating in 1897. Bringelly village grew up around the school and post office. The Retreat, post resumption, was 1187 acres (480ha). In 1901 the property title was transferred to Pearce's wife Elizabeth Charlotte, and it was subsequently sold. The Pearce family owned The Retreat more than 30 years, the longest period of tenure in its history to that date. In May 1901 George Albert Church, grazier of Campbelltown bought The Retreat, and, heavily mortgaged, it was sold in 1911 to Arthur Owen Ryder, gentleman of North Sydney, who sold it within months to Charles Tyson of Aberdeen, grazier, who renamed it \\"Kelvin\\". The farm may have been attractive due to its proximity to abattoirs, four of which were in Liverpool in 1912, and for agistment of cattle prior to sale or slaughter. In March 1914 Philip Staughton, grazier of Dalappol, Narrandera bought Kelvin. In October added to the land by buying lots 12-17 of Section 4, part of the subdivision of Hutchinson's former grant. This gave Kelvin access to Clyde Road to the east, later known as Badgery's Creek Road. In 1918 Hugh Peter MacDonald, grazier of Yandra, Nimmitabel, bought Kelvin, transferring title to Lorna Jessie MacDonald, spinster, in 1921. Later records indicate that sheep were grazed on the property. From 19 March 1942 to 28 February 1945 370 acres of the 1320 acre property was leased by Lorna MacDonald to the Commonwealth Government, converted for use as a \\"Dispersal Aerodrome\\", for National Security Regulations by the RAAF. During this time it was owner-operated as a holding area for sheep marketing, wool growing and fattening, having a well improved grazing area with all necessary buildings. The Commonwealth's interest in Kelvin was influenced by a flat area along South Creek suitable as an airstrip. Similar defence positions at Penrith were a response to war in the Pacific and Australia's preparations for conflict. The Dispersal area was never used and in 1944 the owner was able to resume use of part of the land for grazing, however lease of the airstrip and buildings was maintained. When it was deemed that the site was no longer of use to the war effort negotiations began to remove redundant items. Gravel surfaces, hideouts and many other items were left in situ. A few pieces of equipment were salvaged and disposed of. Compensation was made for fence repairs and estimates made for work to restore the buildings. In 1954 the National Trust of Australia (NSW) led by Ward & Olive Havard visited Kelvin. Between 1950 and September 1960 portions of Kelvin were transferred to the Commonwealth of AustraliaLots 13 & 14 DP 2650 & part Portions 21 & 22 FP 90328 and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission.Lots 15-17 Sec 4 DP2650 A strip of land (part of Lot 12) was retained, maintaining access between the residue of Kelvin and Badgery's Creek Road to the west. Traditional farm access had been from the east across Thompson's Creek, slightly north of the homestead. By 1960 Kelvin was approximately 970 acres. When bought by the Medich family in 1982, Kelvin was of the order of 250 acres. Kelvin was again subdivided in 1985, creating a new road (Kelvin Park Drive) connecting the homestead complexLot 27 and Lot 26, between Thompson's Creek and South Creek, to Bringelly Road (to the south). 25 smaller building allotments facing Bringelly Road were also formed (Lots 1-25LPI DP 712840). In 1990 Kelvin Park was further subdivided into 6 allotments, isolating the homestead and farm buildings on a substantially smaller allotment of less than 10 hectares,Lot 271 accessed by The Retreat Road. Lot 26 east of Thompson's Creek was also subdivided into residential allotments. Kelvin is associated with the historic property \\"Collingwood\\" in Liverpool and also that of \\"Fernleigh\\" in Sutherland, through owner Thomas Laycock Junior's estates. Fernleigh was built for Laycock junior, who, while himself mostly resident at \\"Kelvin\\", built Fernleigh for his second wife Margaret Connell and the six children of his first marriage to Isabella Bunker of \\"Collingwood\\", Liverpool.  Description  Landscape Kelvin Park Group consists of: * the homestead, an early Colonial Georgian, single storey, stuccoed brick bungalow with hipped, iron roof; * the kitchen (possible the former homestead), a detached, single storey Early Colonial Georgian style bungalow to the west of the main homestead; * the Servants' or Maids' quarters, and dairy; * the Coach House, a one and a half storey sandstock brick Early Victorian style building with a loft, also used as a stables and a lock up; * two slab timber sheds; * landscape features, including gardens, trees, driveways and fences; * late 20th century farm buildings and structures, stabling, sheds and yards; * various relics and other works including a cellar, cistern, early tank and tank stand and horse sweep; * the site's potential archaeological resourcesForm, 2005, modified Read, S., 7/2005 The property was reported to be in good condition with high archaeological potential as at 17 March 2006. =Homestead= Homestead Kelvin is a stuccoed single storey Georgian farmhouse. Hipped iron roof, cranked in vernacular fashion over wide high verandah on three sides. This is paved with sandstone. The roof supported on heavily chamfered timber posts and with an exceptionally finely scalloped timber valance board. Shuttered windows. Front door has beautiful elliptical fanlight over it. Exceptional cedar joinery inside. At rear is sandstock brick kitchen, dairy, offices, small carriage house at rear.AHC, 1998 =Grounds and gardens= The main building group of Kelvin Park is sited on a low hill with a good outlook to the west of and above Thompsons Creek, and is set in a well maintained but largely modern garden with a number of important early trees. A circular driveway in front of the house around the base of a large fig (Ficus sp.) tree is a remnant of the original/early carriage loop but appears to be no longer used for vehicular traffic. At the entrance to the homestead are remnants of an old/earlier garden and over the water tank stand is an old climbing rose. The major early trees around the house and outbuildings group include a hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), 3 camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) (2 flanking the front door), and the fig (Ficus sp.) that forms a centre-piece in the driveway loop. Many of the original early plantings have been removed over time and there has been a major garden refurbishment since the 1970s. A modern swimming pool has been installed in the front garden. The remnants of the early layout include part of an ironstone gravel drive, fine lawns, the gravelled forecourt to the stables behind (west) of the house and large old trees. The trees of most heritage value are considered to be the two pines which include hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), brown pine (Podocarpus elatus), Canary Island pine (Pinus canariensis), and Monterey pines (Pinus radiata). Two large camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) flank the view from the front door, in the carriage loop. Other notable elements of the garden include cypress, old olive trees (Olea sp.), Cape plumbago bushes (Plumbago capensis), a large lemon- scented gum (Corymbia citriodora), the fine hedge (Campsis sp.) between house and stable forecourt, and the creeping fig (Ficus pumila) covering the walls of the stables. The main homestead garden is enclosed with a timber and wire mesh fence. A wide and relatively old timber gate gives access to this enclosed area from the north. The present vehicular approach to the site terminates in the rear service courtyard and the entrance to this is marked by a pair of (early) half-round topped timber post with more modern timber rail fencing.LEP listing/landscape, modified Read, S., 2006 A remnant core of a farm complex including homestead, outbuildings, garden including plantings and paddocks. Its current entry drive orientation (from the south, south-west and south-east) dates from a subdivision which created a new road in from the south-east, called The Retreat. The original estate access up until then was from the east over Thompson's Creek, approaching the house from the north-east then north.Read, S., 2005 = Modifications and dates = * 1818 1200 acres (486 hectares) Laycock, and from 1824 Campbell) * 1825 AA company extends the house and builds housing for their workers and families with convict labour * 1833+ Kennerley adds numerous outbuildings * part of land resumed for development of urban infrastructure including roads, school and post office necessary for establishing the village of Bringelly (in Kelvin's south-west corner) * 1896 land in southern boundary of farm resumed by Minister for Public Works to build Bringelly Road, and at farm's south-west corner, for the Northern Road and a school (which was operating by 1897). Residue of the farm was over 1187 acres (480ha). * 1911 Charles Tyson renamed the farm \\"Kelvin\\". * -5 Commonwealth Government leased the farm for use as a \\"Dispersal Aerodrome\\" for the RAAF, stock were removed and areas fenced off. Alterations to buildings were made to accommodate RAAF requirements during the war. Substantial amounts of timber on the property were felled (some to clear flight approaches to the airstrip), some used for construction purposes. When deemed no longer necessary, negotiations ensued to remove redundant items. Gravel surfaces, hiedouts and many other items were left in situ. A few pieces of equipment were salvaged or disposed of. * 1950-60 portions (to the west and north of the homestead group) were transferred to the Commonwealth and Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC). A strip of land was retained, maintaining access between Kelvin Park and Badgery's Creek Road to the west. Property reduced to approximately 970 acres. * 1972 Medich family bought the property, by then of about 250 acres. * 1985 Kelvin (360 hectares) was subdivided into 2 hectare (5 acre) lots, creating a new road (Kelvin Park Drive) connecting the homestead complex, between Thompson's Creek and South Creek, to Bringelly Road in the south. 25 smaller building allotments facing Bringelly Road were also formed. * In 1990 Kelvin Park was further subdivided into six allotments, isolating the homestead group on a substantially smaller allotment of less than 10 hectares, accessed by the (new) Retreat Road. Lot 26 to the east of Thompson's Creek was also subdivided into residential allotments.Form Architects, CMP Addenda, 2005 Its current entry drive orientation (from the south, south-west and south-east) dates from a subdivision which created a new road in from the south-east, called The Retreat. The original estate access up until then was from the east over Thompson's Creek, approaching the house from the north-east then north. During field inspections for the Heritage Study Review undertaken in 2004 it was noted that the gardens and setting in the immediate environs of the group has undergone some changes since 1992. Photographic records indicate that some vegetation to the rear of the house has been removed. According to the present landowner general garden maintenance was conducted at the site over the last few years. In addition the wider setting of the site is being encroached upon by residential development. Nonetheless some of earlier mature trees remain, including the fig that forms a centre-piece in the driveway loop. The fencing and various entrance gates described in 1992 are still intact.LEP listing/landscape, 2004  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Kelvin Park, formerly known as Cottage-ville or Retreat Farm, is able to demonstrate the pastoral development of Bringelly from 1818. Although there is only a remnant (9.784 ha) of the original 1200 acre site (486ha), the homestead and farm buildings in their current setting with extensive views over rural land, is still able to demonstrate the principles of 19th century farm estate architecture, planning and design. Kelvin Park is significant for its association with a number of people and organisations of importance in NSW's cultural history, including Thomas Laycock Junior who established the farm at Bringelly, and later owners, John Thomas Campbell and Alfred Kennerley. The lease of the property by the Australian Agricultural Company, the country's oldest agricultural and pastoral development company established in 1824, is of particular significance. The homestead at Kelvin Park retains its colonial Georgian single-storey form and planning and is representative of a gentleman's rural residence of the 1820s. Despite some modifications it retains the architectural elements and character that make it a good example of its type. The kitchen wing and servants' quarters are modest examples of early colonial Georgian style architecture but similarly retain their original form and planning. All of these buildings are evidence of the establishment of a home and farm by Thomas Laycock. The brick coach house at Kelvin Park retains its picturesque, early Victorian form, planning and much of its original detailing. It is evidence of the development of the property in the 1850s by Alfred Kennerley, who later became Premier of Tasmania. The two slab barns are evidence of Kelvin Park as a working farm from 1818 until, at least, the mid-20th century. The structures demonstrate 19th century building methods and farm practice. The buildings at Kelvin Park belong to an important and rare group of colonial Georgian and early Victorian farm buildings that contribute to the historic rural landscape. They are evidence of continuity of land use for farming for 187 years (to 2005). The form of, and elements within, the garden, courtyard areas and entry to the property are evidence of the planning of the homestead complex by Laycock and subsequent owners and express the status they hoped to convey. The homestead of Kelvin Park retains important historic views to the east to Thompson's Creek and beyond to South Creek. The site also retains views of other historically related rural landscapes beyond the current boundaries such as the pasture and stands of trees to the north. Both views contribute to the site's significance and maintain the context of the homestead group. Kelvin Park group, including the homestead complex and remnant of farmland is significant at local, regional, state and national levels. All areas of the site are considered equally significant.FORM Architects, 12/2006, slightly modified, Read, S., 12/2006 The Kelvin Park site landscaping is a significant component of the Kelvin Park group. The early numerous tree plantings contribute to making the site a notable landmark in the area. The remaining details of driveways, fencing and entrances also contribute to the historic and social evidence provided by the site of its original patterns of occupation and use. The site is part of an intact early 19th century farm complex that is now rare within the wider urbanised environs of Liverpool. There is the potential to gain more information on the site from further archaeological and documentary research. (LEP listing/landscape). The setting of the house on a knoll above a creek, its remnant layout of early buildings and garden, and its fine, mature trees, particularly its variety of old pines, add greatly to the character and significance of the property. The garden and setting are considered to have regional significancePerumal Murphy Wu, 1990 Built by Thomas Laycock junior, 1820, having received the Bringelly grant in 1818. He returned to Australia in 1817 after fighting for England in the American War of 1812.

The institution was responsible for educating MƒÅori and Aboriginal children who had been taken, like Egan, from their families.  Education  Egan reentered education at the age of 37 when she enrolled to study for a diploma at what is now the Central Institute of Technology. This took her from 1994 to 1998 in Perth and she then set out to gain an associate degree in art. This was completed by the millennium and the following year she received a graduate degree from Perth's Curtin University of Technology. Since then she has gone onto take post graduate qualifications in Cultural Tourism and Training and Assessment which she had completed by 2008.

He also played in the Southern League for Brighton & Hove Albion. Life and career Anthony was born in Basford, Nottinghamshire. He was the younger brother of George and Henry Anthony, who both played cricket for that county. He began his football career at local level with clubs including Osmaston, Heanor Town, Newstead Byron and Arnold before signing for Football League First Division club Nottingham Forest in February 1904 for a fee reported as ¬£25. He made six league appearances for Forest, but was reportedly not thought strong enough for top-class football, and moved on to Brighton & Hove Albion of the Southern League in May 1905. He worked on his physical conditioning at his new club, and became a regular at outside right in the first team with 13 goals from 119 appearances in all competitions over two-and-a-half years. Described by club historian Tim Carder as \\"a tricky little ball-player, noted for the accuracy of his crosses with either foot\\", he attracted attention from bigger clubs. After Brighton eliminated First Division Preston North End from the 1907‚Äì08 FA Cup after two replays, Blackburn Rovers were convinced to sign Anthony and two teammates, Dick Wombwell and Joe Lumley, for \\"a substantial sum\\", widely reported as ¬£750. The Football Association had recently imposed a rule forbidding more than ¬£350 to be paid for any single player, and it was understood that Anthony was the primary target and Lumley and Wombwell were makeweights in the circumvention of that maximum. Anthony soon established himself at outside left in Blackburn's first team. He made 149 league appearances, was part of the 1911‚Äì12 Football League-winning side, and played in the Charity Shield, in which Blackburn beat Southern League champions Queens Park Rangers 2‚Äì1 in aid of the Titanic Disaster Fund. He appeared only once in 1913‚Äì14 as Rovers again finished as champions. At the end of the season, the Football League gave Rovers permission to pay Anthony a lump sum in lieu of the benefit match for which he qualified after five years service. He moved on in January 1915, to Stalybridge Celtic of the Lancashire Combination. Anthony served in the Army in the First World War, and then worked in the mines. He spent 18 years in the dispatch department of a Nottingham car parts supplier, working until two days before his death in Basford in January 1950 at the age of 70.

Life =Youth in London and Essex= Charles Jenkinson's father was a stonemason, also called Charles Jenkinson, and his mother was Mary Ann Elizabeth, n√©e Evans. With seven siblings and irregular work for his father as a docker, Charles Jenkinson grew up experiencing overcrowded East-end urban conditions, even living for a time with his grandmother and an uncle at 78 Sussex Street, Poplar because of a lack of space at home.John A. Hargreaves, 'Jenkinson, Charles (1887‚Äì1949)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), . Jenkinson was educated at Tarrance Street council school, leaving at fourteen to work as a bookkeeper and help support the family. However, as the years passed he grew increasingly disillusioned with the world of business and its ethics. Jenkinson took an active role in his local church, St Stephen's, Poplar, and in the Labour Party. At St Stephen's, he was a chorister and then the music librarian. He then became a Sunday school teacher in the parish of St James-the-Less, Bethnal Green. He joined the Labour Party in 1908. Jenkinson's socialist activism led him to meet Ramsay MacDonald and Conrad Noel, and in 1909 he became Noel's lay secretary in the rural parish of Thaxted. As a member of the Church Socialist League, Jenkinson campaigned against pew rents at St James- the-Less and at Thaxted worked for improved living conditions for farm labourers. He was secretary of the North-West Essex Federation of the National Agricultural Labourers' and Rural Workers' Union, was the election agent for Edward George Maxted when he ran for Essex County Council. Jenkinson married a Thaxted labourer's daughter, Emily Cecilia Caton (b. 1882/3?), on 28 July 1914, with whom he had a son in 1915. In the assessment of John A. Hargreaves, 'her devoted companionship was crucial in sustaining Jenkinson' through war, study, and 'his remarkable ministry' in the Church of England. =War and ordination= During the First World War, Jenkinson served successfully in the Royal Army Medical Corps. As a conscientious objector, he refused to fight, and, with other conscientious objectors, was arrested for refusing to be transferred to the infantry. He and other people in this situation were released following a public campaign. During the war years, he also taught himself Latin and Greek. Following demobilization in April 1919, Jenkinson matriculated at Fitzwilliam Hall, Cambridge to study law and for ordination. He graduated in 1921, after which he attended the Oxford theological college Ripon Hall and, in the same year, became a curate in Barking, London. While at Cambridge, he attempted to establish a branch there of the Christian Socialist League.I. Goodfellow, ' The Church Socialist League 1906-1923: Origins, Development and Disintegration' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Durham University, 1983). =Vicar of Holbeck and Leeds councillor= Quarry Hill Flats, one of Jenkinson's foremost social-housing projects, photographed in 1943. In 1927, Jenkinson requested appointment to 'the hardest parish in the country'; accordingly, he was posted to the parish of St John and St Barnabas, Holbeck, one of the worst slums of Leeds. He stood for election as a Labour councillor for the ward of North Holbeck, winning a seat in November 1930. Jenkinson's key interest, for which he sought support by drawing on both Christian ethics and socialist thinking, was housing reform, an area in which the Conservative- dominated Council was not even willing to comply with laws such as the Greenwood Housing Act of 1930. His campaigning included publishing the pamphlet Sentimentality or Common Sense? (supported by the local clergy in June 1931); establishing a Council sub-committee on housing policy; in 1933 publishing a ninety-page minority report called Housing Policy in the City of Leeds in response to what he viewed as an inadequate report by the Council; and being the first chair of the new housing committee in Leeds's Labour council of 1933‚Äì35, which took the report as its blueprint for action. Within two years of the formation of the committee, Leeds rehoused 6000 inhabitants of slums, mostly to new green-field estates or new flats at Quarry Hill, Leeds, using an innovative differential rent scheme to help poorer families. Many of Jenkinson's own congregation moved to the new estate of Belle Isle, Leeds. In the face of fierce Conservative opposition, however, he lost his seat in 1936. As people were rehoused, they were required to have their furnishings disinfested of lice by the Council, and the vehicle used for this came to be known as 'Jenkinson's bug van'.David Thornton, Leeds: A Historical Dictionary of People, Places, and Events (Huddersfield: Northern Heritage Publications, 2013), p. 127. In the ensuing decade, however, Jenkinson was appointed or elected to a range of political roles: * Labour Party sub- committee on town planning and post-war housing (1941). * Member of the Board of Trade advisory committee on utility furniture (1942). * Leeds councillor, later overseeing implementation of Leeds's post-war housing policy (1943). * Leader of Leeds's Labour group, alderman, chairman of the finance and parliamentary committee, and Central Housing Advisory Committee (1947). * Chairman of Stevenage New Town Development Corporation (1948). =Death= Jenkinson Close, Holbeck, Leeds, named after Charles Jenkinson. In May 1949, Jenkinson was diagnosed with an inoperable cancer, and he died on 3 August 1949. Appearance John A. Hargreaves summarises Jenkinson's appearance thus: > A tall, bespectacled figure with a ruddy complexion and a steadfast and > composed look in his penetrating eyes, he exhibited a Spartan lifestyle, > wearing for many years an old overcoat purchased for a shilling in a church > jumble sale. His most cherished possessions were his books and his bicycle, > and he was most characteristically remembered, soft-collared and flannel- > trousered, hurtling through the streets of Leeds, with his coat-tails > flapping in the wind ... Neither Cambridge nor Oxford, nor indeed Yorkshire, > made the slightest impression on his native Cockney accent and his speech > was characterized by its high-pitched rapid delivery. A doughty debater, he > displayed immense physical and mental energy, his natural modesty giving way > in later years to a greater assertiveness, an intolerance of opposition, and > an occasional brusqueness. Jenkinson did not wish, as a clergyman, to accentuate his differences from the laity, and avoided wearing a clerical collar. He would happily help with decorating his Church, clad in a boiler-suit. But he would conduct worship in a Canterbury cap, cassock and gown, and occasionally address political meetings in the same garb when he did not have time to change after a service. Theological views Jenkinson's theology was shaped by evangelicalism, Christian socialism (particularly the thought of F. D. Maurice and Percy Dearmer), and Anglo-Catholic leanings characterised by Catholic modernism. In 1921, Jenkinson defended Henry Dewsbury Alves Major, the principal of Ripon Hall, Oxford, when Major was accused of heresy with regard to his ideas about the resurrection of Jesus. He supported the ordination of women in the Anglican communion, and the reunification of the Anglican and Free Church. He opposed the segregation of clergy from laity.I.

First entering the council in 2013 as a replacement, he was elected in the 2014 election and was appointed as speaker. Participating in the campaign team of both Joko Widodo and Basuki Tjahaja Purnama in the 2012 and 2017 gubernatorial elections, he has been investigated for allegations of bribery and fraud. Background He was born in Kudus, Central Java on 13 May 1962. According to Prasetyo, he was a drug user in his youth. Career Among other jobs he held before entering politics, he had worked as general manager for a cafe in Sudirman Central Business District. He was also part of Joko Widodo's successful campaign team in the 2012 gubernatorial election. He was appointed by his party to the Jakarta DPRD on 21 June 2013, replacing other members who moved to Nasdem. In the 2014 election, he managed to gain a seat from the first electoral district. With his party PDI-P winning the most votes in the city's election, he was appointed as speaker and was voted in on 16 September 2014, officially becoming speaker on 26 September. In 2015, he requested tighter monitoring on convenience stores selling alcohol to underage buyers. In the same year, during a budget dispute between new governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (or Ahok) and the city council, he got sick, according to himself due to being too involved in the issue. Ahok called him \\"too good-hearted\\", while Prasetyo asked for Ahok to communicate better with the councilors. He was investigated in 2016 by the Corruption Eradication Commission for suspicions of involvement in a bribery scandal regarding reclamation in the Bay of Jakarta, where he was accused of acting as middlemen between the source and other councilors. Later, he led the campaign team for incumbent Basuki Tjahaja Purnama in the 2017 gubernatorial election, though Basuki lost. When Basuki was arrested for religious blasphemy, he expressed his surprise, stating that \\"Ahok wasn't a recidivist, he's an honest leader.\\" Prasetyo also supported an increase in salaries for the city's councillors. As the governor changed to Anies Baswedan, Prasetyo attacked the new governor on his handling of Tanah Abang, calling Baswedan's policy of closing the streets to allow vendors a \\"bad example\\". He also criticized then-deputy governor Sandiaga Uno's decision to sell stakes in a beer company owned by the provincial government without first bringing it up to the council. In May 2018, he was investigated on allegations of fraud committed in 2014. He was accused by a former provincial secretary of Riau of having claimed to be able to position the secretary as acting governor of the province (when the governor was removed on corruption charges) and demanded a payment of Rp 3.25 billion, but did not deliver on his promises when paid. Following the 2019 legislative elections, Prasetyo was reelected to the council and retained his speaker seat. Personal life Prasetyo is a fan of off-road racing, owning multiple jeeps since the 1980s, and in an interview stated that he trains twice a month. He is married to Novie Muniarsari and has four children.

History Overbury was born in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, a daughter of Thomas Overbury, manager of the Bliss Tweed Mill in that town. Her mother, Septima Overbury, n√©e Bliss (c. 1818 ‚Äì 25 August 1880), was a daughter of William Bliss, owner of the business. Thomas and Septima, with their two children Mary and Margaret, sailed for South Australia aboard the steamer Bosphorus arriving in Adelaide in June 1855 and settled at Thomas street, Unley, their home for many years. Mary's mother had some artistic ability and Mary appears to have inherited her mother's love and aptitude for art, and was one of the early students of the School of Arts and Crafts founded by Charles Hill in 1861 and from 1882 run by H. P. Gill. She was member, later a fellow, of the S.A. Society of Arts (Inc.). Between 1880 and 1890 she received several awards from entries submitted to the Royal College of Art at South Kensington as modules towards a Master of Arts Certificate. After Gill's death Overbury established her own school at Hawthorn. She taught at Tormore School. Overbury died age 71 after falling down stairs leading to the cellar of her home, Prescott Terrace, Rose Park, where she lived with her sister Margaret (died 1932), a school teacher who never married. Margaret Overbury was for six years a mistress at the school conducted by the Misses Kay (daughters of Robert Kay) at Trinity street, St Peters.

Norman (1850-1913) and his son Earl Norman (1888-1951) in Natchez, Mississippi, United States between 1876 and 1951, which produced around 75,000 images documenting many significant types of events and subjects in the various small towns along the lower Mississippi River. Its output remains one of the most valuable and comprehensive visual collection of Southern American life from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The surviving Norman Studio photographs currently reside in the Lower Mississippi Valley Collection of the libraries of Louisiana State University. History The Norman Studio's history dates to before the American Civil War. It was founded by local Natchez photographer Henry D. Gurney and his brother Marsh, who were two of the first photographers permanently based in Mississippi, having been operating in Natchez since 1851‚Äîa mere twelve years after the medium itself had even been invented in France by Louis Daguerre. In 1870, the twenty-year-old Henry Norman arrived in Natchez by steamboat from Louisville, Kentucky, where he and his mother had moved from Georgia, possibly following the death of Norman's father. Norman found a job working in Gurney's studio, and when the latter retired in 1876, Norman bought out the business, including Gurney's equipment. Norman soon set about becoming one of the most prolific and sought-after photographers in the lower Mississippi Valley. He established his studio in downtown Natchez on the second floor of a handsome brick building with a cast-iron ground floor storefront. Norman's skill handling a camera meant that he was called upon over the next thirty-five years to document large numbers of people and events in the area, among both the white and African-American citizenry. He was well known for his portraiture, but Norman was not merely a studio man or a simple toiler at the disposal of every person who called. He frequently took his camera out with him to produce candid images of people in the streets or hard at work, along with children at play or resting in the grass on the bluffs high above the Mississippi River, the effects of inclement weather such as the floods that sometimes plagued the low-lying towns and the Natchez wharf, and exciting daily events such as the arrival of trains at the railroad station or visits by dignitaries, including the 1909 stop in Natchez by then-President of the United States William Howard Taft. Norman married and had three sons, all of whom eventually became photographers. Only the youngest, Earl, born in 1888, stayed to work with his father, and at only 25 years of age he inherited the studio when Henry died. For the next thirty-eight years, Earl continued upon the foundations that his father had built, until his own death in 1951. Upon Earl Norman's death, the glass negatives and resultant positives essentially sat around collecting dust for the better part of the next decade, until they were all purchased, along with the remaining photography equipment, from his widow in 1961 by Thomas W. Gandy, a Natchez physician and local history buff, and his wife Joan. The Gandys then began the arduous task of cleaning the items and determining which of them were still usable and viewable. The Gandys then selected the best of the lot and published them in several books with accompanying commentary during the 1970s and 1980s, giving the balance of the collection to Louisiana State University and then donating the rest after the publication of the books. LSU as of 2018 has scanned a small portion of the photographs and made them available for viewing online. Scope of the Collection As noted above, the Gurneys and Normans photographed a very wide variety of subjects. Perhaps the most significant portions of the collection are the images of scores of steamboats that proved vital to the region's economic recovery in the decades of Reconstruction and the subsequent prosperity that sustained Natchez as one of Mississippi's most important cities well into the twentieth century. Despite their familiarity and importance to commerce in mid-continent America throughout the Victorian and Edwardian era, many of these vessels were never captured on negatives or film, and the Normans‚Äô photographs remain, in some cases, the only surviving images of them, especially since steamboats were notoriously prone to natural or man-made disasters and might only last a few years or less. A similar charge might be made about much of the built environment of Natchez that has been subject to dramatic change during the twentieth century. Much of the surviving visual documentation of commercial and residential buildings in and around Natchez lost to alterations, demolition, or disasters can be found in the Norman Studio's production. Included in this must also be the visual documentation of the former city of Bayou Sara, Louisiana, south of Natchez, now virtually abandoned in favor of the higher ground of St. Francisville after repeated floods made habitation along the river's course impracticable. The Normans and Gurneys documented all facets of life in and around Natchez. Their surviving output includes diverse subject matter from panoramic views of the town taken from the steeple of St. Mary's (Catholic) Cathedral (now a minor basilica), to parties aboard barges and steamboats on the Mississippi River, to storefronts, to workers hauling cotton and other harvested crops to market, to ordinary street activity and gamblers playing card games.

A San, she was a member of the Ncoakhoe tribe of the Naro. Qgam was born in 1934 in Ghanzi, and had only three months' education; nevertheless, she came to be fluent in five African languages. She worked for a time as a nanny and domestic. It was during her employment in Namibia that she was first exposed to textile art, when an employer taught her to do needlework and embroidery. In 1990 she joined the Kuru Art Project as a translator; exposure to different art forms encouraged her to try her hand at creating artwork herself, although she had no formal training. In 1999 she was one of eight artists, four from the Kalahari and four from New Mexico, to participate in a cultural exchange with the University of New Mexico in which they would create a suite of lithographs upon the subject of tricksters in folklore. In January 2000 her work was shown in Gaborone alongside that of Ann Gollifer and Neo Matome. During her career Qgam showed work through Southern Africa as well as in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Her work is represented in the collection of the Lechwe Trust in Zambia and the Portland Museum of Art. Three of her lithographs are owned by the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Late in life Qgam took in fellow San artist Cg'ose Ntcox'o after the latter was widowed.

Tembien, Mekonni or even Seqota are mentioned as his possible place of origin. He is said to have marched into Agame and defeated the earlier local ruler Kendashih, the descendant of the Summe, the ancestral father of the Irob. The shum Agame soon dominated the core area of Agame, near modern Adigrat. Akhadom's residence (maqmat mekonnen, \\"residence of the ruler) is said to have been situated somewhere in the area to the west of Adigrat. Tradition places Akhadom 19 generations ago (with one generation ranging between 25-30 years), around 1425 AD. There is indeed a record of a certain Akhadom, precisely in the reign of atse Dawit II. While Dawit II was gaining control over the Beta Israel country, west of the Tekeze, his troops were on one occasion overpowered by Beta Israel resistance. The Emperor had sent fresh auxiliaries to them under the command of Akhadom, governor of Tigray. His expedition was successful.

He was an experienced soldier and fought for the king during the Fronde before becoming a naval captain. Towards the end of the Franco-Dutch War he led the land forces that took Tobago from the Dutch before taking command of the French Antilles. During the Nine Years' War he was active in the struggle with the English and Dutch in the Windward Islands. He captured Sint Eustatius and Saint Kitts, and defended Martinique against a large English expedition in 1693. Early years (1622‚Äì77) Charles de Bl√©nac, Marquis de la Roche-Courbon, was born to a noble family in 1622 in Romegoux, Saintonge. His parents were Jacques de Courbon Bl√©nac and Marie Thison, dame de La Sauzaie. His sister Marie married Andr√© de Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Charles de Bl√©nac married Ang√©lique de La Rochefoucauld, daughter of Louis de la Rochefoucauld, seigneur de Bay√®res. She was the widow of his cousin. They would have eleven children. During the Fronde rebellion (1648‚Äì53) Bl√©nac supported the infant King Louis XIV of France, and in recognition of his services was made count of Bl√©nac in 1659. For a long time he served in the land armies, reaching the rank of mar√©chal de camp. In 1669 he transferred to the navy, which was then in the process of being formed. He advanced quickly through the ranks and became capitaine de vaisseau. He commanded the Infante in the expedition of Jean II d'Estr√©es against the Barbary pirates. He commanded the Fort in the Battle of Solebay in 1672. Bl√©nac was quick to take offense, and early in 1673 was briefly imprisoned for insulting a superior officer. After his release, in August 1673 he was captain of Fortun√© in the Battle of Texel. First Battle of Tobago (March 1677) The Franco-Dutch War began in 1672 and lasted until the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678. First Battle of Tobago. The Glorieux fires at burning Dutch ships. In the Action of March 1677 a French force under Admiral Jean II d'Estr√©es attempted to take the Dutch fortress of Sterrshans on Tobago but was repulsed. D'Estrees entered Klip Bay at dawn on 3 March 1677 in his flagship, the 72-gun Glorieux, accompanied by the 58-gun Pr√©cieux, 46-gun √âmerillon and 38-gun Laurier. His second in command Louis Gabaret in the 56-gun Intr√©pide led a squadron nearer to the shore that included the 62-gun Fendant commanded by Bl√©nac and four smaller ships. The French engaged an arc of anchored Dutch warships, under-manned since the Dutch had transferred many men to the land defenses. French land forces attempted to storm fort Sterreschans but were repulsed on three separate attempts. The struggling ships in the harbour began to burn, with fire spreading from one ship to another. Eventually the French had to break off after three ships had been burned to the waterline, two run ashore and other badly damaged, with over 1,000 casualties. D'Estree withdrew toward Grenada and was back in France by early July. During the retreat to Grenada the French heard of the death of Jean-Charles de Baas, and Bl√©nac was appointed to replace him as lieutenant general of the Antilles (lieutenant-g√©n√©ral des isles d‚ÄôAm√©rique). He returned to France with D'Estr√©es to have his appointment confirmed. Louis XIV decided to mount another expedition against Tobago later in 1677. Bl√©nac and returned with d'Estrees in the autumn of 1677, taking office in November. Second Battle of Tobago (December 1677) On 3 October 1677 d'Estr√©es left Brest for the West Indies with a squadron of seven ships of the line, four smaller ships, five en fl√ªte ships and four fireships. It was the strongest naval force that France had ever sent to the Americas. D'Estr√©es had the 68-gun Terrible as his flagship. His second in command was Fran√ßois-B√©n√©dict de Rouxel(fr), marquis de Grancey in the 64-gun Tonnant, and Bl√©nac commanded the 60-gun Belliqueux. Bl√©nac had instructions to coordinate his action as governor general with d'Estr√©es, and to recruit soldiers and colonists as reinforcements. The squadron sailed to the Cape Verde Islands, took the slaving island of Gor√©e (off Senegal) from the Dutch, then sailed fast to the Antilles. D'Estr√©es stopped briefly at Barbados to find out what he could about the strength of the Dutch, then reached Tobago on 6 December 1677. Bl√©nac led the land force of 950 men, with an artillery train to besiege the Dutch fort. The mortars and cannon had to be dragged about to the top of a hill that overlooked the fort, which took three days. The third shell fired by the French hit the powder magazine, and the explosion destroyed the fort. 250 men died, including Admiral Jacob Binckes and 16 officers. The French attacked at once and within an hour had seized what remained of the fort as well as four sinking ships. They took 600 prisoners. The French destroyed all the houses and plantation buildings on the island, deported the people and abandoned the island. This victory destroyed Dutch military power in the Antilles. D'Estr√©es next sailed to Martinique to prepare an attack on Cura√ßao. Bl√©nac raised a large contingent of buccaneers to support this expedition. Governor general of the Antilles (1677‚Äì90) =Peacetime (1677‚Äì88)= Dutch attack on Fort Royal (1674).One of Bl√©nac's key priorities was to strengthen the fort. During Bl√©nac's time in office as governor general of the Antilles he devoted much of his energy to developing the city of Fort Royal, Martinique, which de Baas had established as the seat of the lieutenant general of the Antilles. He chose to live at Fort-Royal instead of Saint- Pierre to encourage growth of the town and the fortress. Before this the town had been an unplanned cluster of buildings along the Car√©nage River. Bl√©nac ordered the bogs around the site to be drained or filled in, making room for a grid of streets centered on a main square known as the Savane (Swamp). He began construction of a church and strengthened the defenses of the citadel. He reported to the king in 1686, In 1680 Bl√©nac accused the governor of Saint Croix of illegally welcoming foreign traders, particularly those selling slaves. In 1682 Jean-Baptiste Colbert appointed his first cousin Michel B√©gon as intendant of the French colonies in the Caribbean, head of the civil and legal administration. He was charged with preparing an ordinance to regulated slavery in these colonies. B√©gon sailed for Martinique that fall, where Bl√©nac showed him what had been done so far on codifying the slave laws. B√©gon spent the next three months studying all the slave ordinances of the French islands, then talked with leading officials and slave owners of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint Christophe. He condensed his findings into a 16-page memorandum that was sent to Versailles in February 1683 and became the basis, with a few small adjustments, of the March 1685 edict known as the Code Noir (Black Code). The king had asked Bl√©nac to participate in drafting the slave code, but he claimed to have done little, and said only that Begin constructed the law \\"in his presence\\". He did help make some provisions concerning slaves milder and more flexible. Bl√©nac left the Martinique for France in March 1683, and returned in April 1684. Claude de Roux de Saint-Laurent, chevalier de Saint- Laurent, acted as governor in his absence. Just before the start of the Nine Years' War, in October 1688 the navy secretary, the marquis de Seignelay informed Bl√©nac and the island governors to prepare to defend themselves against Spain, since war with Spain was likely once Louis XIV declared war on the Dutch Republic. The governors were to inspect their fortifications, prepare artillery batteries, and make their militias and local defense forces ready to fight. France would give no support other than send two privateers from Saint-Malo to attack Dutch ships. =War with Holland and England (1688‚Äì90)= Plan du fort de la Basse terre de l'isle de St. Christophle signed by Bl√©nac At the start of the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97), in November 1688 Seignelay told Bl√©nac to attack Sint Eustatius, to the northwest of Saint Christophe, destroy the island's fort and deport all the inhabitants. He was to use local forces only, and to cover the costs by selling slaves. The minister changed his mind when he heard that several large Dutch privateers were leaving for the Antilles, and before year end he heard that privateers were pillaging some of the small and indefensible French islands. In March 1689 Seignelay sent the 52-gun Perle to Martinique, and after Louis XIV declared war on Spain in April 1689 he sent the frigates Mignon and Friponne to the Antilles to defend the colonies and the French traders, and to attack the Dutch privateers. When England declared war on France in May 1689 Seignelay placed four warships at the disposal of Bl√©nac. Bl√©nac also used buccaneers as auxiliaries, particularly during the start of the war in 1689 during attacks on Saint Kitts and Sint Eustatius. In the West Indies the English would not cooperate with the Dutch, their allies. Bl√©nac took advantage of this, and sent a secret expedition that captured Sint Eustatius. On 28 March 1689 a small fleet of three ships, a brigantine, a bark and three smaller vessels under Bl√©nac and the Intendant Gabriel Dumaitz de Goimpy was joined by another ship at Guadeloupe. At Saint Christopher (Saint Kitts) they were joined by three brigantines and three barks. With 17 vessels and 1,200 men Bl√©nac set course for the Dutch island of Sint Eustatius, where he arrived on 3 April 1689. The Dutch under Governor Lucas Schorer were totally unprepared for the attack, and just two ships managed to escape carrying valuables. The French landed at two places on the island, and after slight resistance the Dutch retreated into Fort Orange in the evening. The next morning, after the French threatened the fort with siege guns the Dutch surrendered and agreed to leave the island. The French destroyed all shore defenses, collected booty and departed, leaving a small 40-man garrison. Saint Christopher. Fort Charles is on the south coast of the west part. Basseterre, also on the south coast, is further east. In July 1689 Bl√©nac heard that there were violent disagreements on Saint Kitts between supporters of King William III of England and Irish Jacobites. On 27 July 1689, after the dispatch vessel Perle had brought news that England and France were at war, Bl√©nac sailed from Martinique with the warships Hasardeux, √âmerillon, Loire, Dauphine and Cheval Marin, 14 merchantmen and 23 sloops. He arrived at Basseterre on the French part of Saint Christopher and landed his army, which quickly occupied all the south of the island. The English governor, Colonel Thomas Hill, took refuge with 400 to 500 defenders in Fort Charles. Bl√©nac settled down for a siege, and for two weeks bombarded the main gate with over 1,000 rounds, achieving little, while a trench was being dug towards the fort. The naval officer Jean- Baptiste du Casse then obtained permission to install a battery on nearby hill from which the interior of the fort could be seen. This was done on the night of 14‚Äì15 August. When the fort's defenders found their gunfire could not reach the new, higher battery they surrendered. The Englist colonists were all ordered to evacuate to Nevis, and their Irish vassals were freed. Bl√©nac sailed for Martinique ten days later leaving Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut as governor. In response, the English attacked and captured Saint Barth√©lemy, plundered the island of slaves, cattle and other goods, and burned all the houses. They made an attempt on Saint Martin that was driven off, then made a highly destructive raid on Marie-Galante. The French learned that the English governor Sir Christopher Codrington was planning to lead a force of about 2,300 to attack Martinique, and was waiting for warships to be fitted out in England to carry his force. Early in 1690 Bl√©nac received over 30 merchantmen escorted by four warships, but chose to take no action against the English, and did not even have the resources to defend his recent conquests. Return to France (1690‚Äì96) Subordinates such as Ducasse were so critical of Bl√©nac's lack of action that he offered to resign. Bl√©nac left Martinique on 29 January 1690 and returned to France \\"on leave\\" on the Pont d'Or to defend himself at court. By July the British had reconquered Saint Kitts and Sint Eustatius. Bl√©nac's successor Fran√ßois d'Alesso, Marquis d'√âragny arrived on 5 February 1691 with 14 warships, strengthened the defenses and in May relieved the French defenders of Fort Saint-Charles in Guadeloupe, who had been besieged by the English. On his return to Martinique d'Eragny was among the victims of an outbreak of yellow fever in August 1691. Governor general of the Antilles (1692‚Äì96) Louis Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain, chancelier de France Louis XIV sent Jean-Baptiste du Casse to help defend the Antilles late in 1691. The king reappointed Bl√©nac as governor general of the Windward Islands. The comte de Pontchartrain gave Bl√©nac a fleet of ten warships, one frigate and two fire ships. He was ordered to attack Barbados and go on to destroy the property of the English colonists in the Leeward Islands. Bl√©nac arrived back in Martinique on 4 February 1692. On 2 March 1692 a convoy of merchant ships escorted by Commodore Ralph Wrenn was passing between Guadeloupe and D√©sirade. The English found Bl√©nac ahead of them in his flagship, the 62-gun Vermandois, supported by the Vaillant, L√©ger, Fran√ßois, Droite, Basque, Chasseur, Solide, Bouffone, Jersey, Neptune and five smaller vessels. The English were completely outnumbered, and set a course to the leeward in the hope of protecting the convoy. Bl√©nac engaged the next day, but Wrenn outmanoeuvred him and managed to escape to the south. Wrenn reached Barbados three days later without any losses. After this the English and French found themselves in a stalemate, where neither could risk invading an enemy island while the other's fleet was intact. The crews of both squadrons suffered from yellow fever, and Wrenn died of the disease. Bl√©nac only had enough sailors to man three warships by the start of July. News came that the English were organizing a major expedition under Sir Francis Wheler to attach the French Antilles. Bl√©nac was told he could not expect help from France. Bl√©nac had been accompanied to Martinique by an engineer, Sieur de Caylus, and during 1692 he directed improvements to the island's defenses while Bl√©nac organized the militia of almost 1,400 men. Pontchartrain ordered that the five vessels of the French navy in the Antilles leave by 1 March 1693. In 1693 Bl√©nac and the governor of Martinique, Nicolas de Gabaret, repulsed the English when they attempted invasion with a force of 4,000 men. The English expedition under Admiral Wheler had 15 warships 3 fire ships, 28 transports and almost 2,000 soldiers, to which Barbados added another 1,000 men. This force invaded in March 1693, and took control of a large area with little opposition. English reinforcements under Captain General Christopher Codrington arrived within two weeks, but the combined force did not engage in serious fighting. The English took 3,000 black slaves, valued at ¬£60,000. An ineffective attack was made on Saint Pierre, then the force departed. Various explanations have been given for the failure to make a serious effort to capture the island. The reason seems to be a combination of the climate, raw troops including unenthusiastic Irish and superior French forces. The French under Ducasse retaliated, but limited their activity to plundering. Bl√©nac died near Fort Royal, Martinique on the night of 8-9 June 1696 from lingering dysentery. He was succeeded by the Thomas-Claude Renart de Fuchsamberg, marquis d'Amblimont.

A state of the art facility when completed in 1923, the school served the city as a high school until 1967, and is a good example of Classical Revival architecture designed by noted school architect George W. Potter. After serving until 2012 as a middle school, the building is now vacant. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. Description and history Bristol's old high school building is located just south of its downtown, on bounded by Memorial Boulevard on the north, and Mellen, South, and Willis Streets on the other three sides. It is a large three-story structure, built with load-bearing brick walls trimmed in cast stone. It has an H-shaped plan, with a north-south central section joining wings oriented east-west. The main entrance is in the eastern face of the center section, with secondary entrances at the faces of the wings. The roof is ringed by a low parapet, with has stepped elements above each of the entrances. The city of Bristol first began offering high school level education in 1883. Classes were at first held in several district schoolhouses, and its first high school (now home to the local historical society) was built in 1891. Increasing population over the next two decades made the need for a new high school apparent, and this building was erected in 1921-23. The school was designed by New York City architect George Potter, who had already designed schools for the city and other locations in Connecticut, and was built on land donated by local industrialist and philanthropist Albert F. Rockwell.

The platform was launched with the common interest of the family members of the victims of enforced disappearance in Bangladesh to learn the fate of their beloved one, who went missing after men in plainclothes posing as law enforcers picked them up from various places of the country. The platform, largely consists of the family members of Bangladesh Nationalist Party leaders since most of the victims had political affiliation with the party, observes the ‚ÄúInternational Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances‚Äù every year in Bangladesh. According to local rights groups, more than 500 people disappeared after being picked up by government agencies since 2009 in Bangladesh. Human Rights Watch published a report on the victims of enforced disappearance in Bangladesh that stated that they have recorded at least 90 cases of enforced disappearance only in 2016. Mayer Daak is similar to that of Argentina's Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo which was founded by Argentine mothers whose children \\"disappeared\\" during the state terrorism of the military dictatorship, between 1976 and 1983. Background Bangladesh Awami League came to power after winning the national election of December 2008 against the backdrop of a turmoil political condition after two consecutive regimes of BNP (2001‚Äì2006) and military-backed civil government (2007‚Äì2008) who were largely criticized for promoting extrajudicial killing with a view to reducing crime. Prior to the election, Awami League promised to put an end to the spate of extrajudicial killing by government agencies and custodial deaths. However, this practice never ended. In 2010, due to the former Prime Minister and BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia‚Äôs eviction from her house, BNP started taking streets while on the other hand, their ally Jamaat- e-Islami supporters started demanding the release of their leaders who were involved in war-crime during Liberation War of Bangladesh. In this context, the government started taking repressive measures against the opposition groups and a few opposition leaders and their activists started disappearing under mysterious situation. The first victim to be recorded was a Dhaka City Corporation councilor Mohammad Chowdhury Alam who was also a member of BNP‚Äôs central committee. He was abducted on June 25, 2010. After Chowdhury Alam, many other disappeared after being picked up by Police, RAB or DB, including a former minister, and many former Member of Parliament. Remarkably, a series of incidents of enforced disappearance occurred just before the national election of January 2014. History The families of the victims of enforced disappearance started gathering together to ask the whereabouts of their loved ones from 2014 and have been observing the ‚ÄúInternational Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances‚Äù in Bangladesh. VOA) The name ‚ÄúMayer Daak‚Äù started being visible on local and international media from 2016, after it was founded on 12 March of the same year. The Human Rights Watch report on Bangladesh's enforced disappearance ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have them‚Äù and ‚ÄúJoint NGO Alternative Report to the UN Human Rights Committee on Bangladesh‚Äù published in 2017 cited the name of this platform and the ordeals of the families. The first major gathering by the platform was a discussion organized on December 4, 2016 where family members of 20 enforced disappearance victims attended and narrated how their family members were picked up and never returned. Programmes and Activity Mayer Daak has been observing the UN declared International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance and International Human Rights Day in Bangladesh since 2016. The platform is also credited for bringing the incidents of enforced disappearance, which is often taken lightly by the government, to the forefront of Bangladesh's politics. They observed International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearance on August 29 in 2017 by organizing a discussion at the National Press Club of Bangladesh. 29 families came to join the hearing in presence of the noted citizens including Professor Asif Nazrul. To mark the International Day of Human Rights in 2017, Mayer Daak called for a gathering on December 10 of the year. Members of 24 families came together. By the April 2018, the platform managed to mobilize 85 families of the victims who disappeared during Awami League rule, between 2010 and 2017, and organized a mass-hearing on April 21 of the year where they detailed their ordeals and demanded the government to let them know what happened to their family members. On August 30, 2018, the platform organized a programme attended by at least 90 families. Reactions Amid repeated calls and outcry, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh also the chief of Bangladesh Awami League, Sheikh Hasina opened up at the parliament in November 2017. She said: ‚ÄúAs per statistics of 2009, 275,000 British citizens disappeared. Of them, the whereabouts of 20,000 is not known. If you consider America, the situation is even worse.‚Äù In response to that, Bangladesh's major opposition group Bangladesh Nationalist Party's General Secretary Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said: ‚ÄúThe remarks about enforced disappearance that the prime minister made is her admission to the fact that they [the government] are involved in the incidents of enforced disappearance.‚Äù Bangladesh's Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said the allegation that the government is pursuing a policy of enforced disappearance is totally baseless. He added: ‚ÄúMany businessmen went into hiding failing to repay their loans in this country. Some people went missing after developing extramarital relationship.‚Äù United Nations human rights experts have called on Bangladesh to act now to halt an increasing number of enforced disappearances in the country, in February 2017. In July 2017, New York-based rights defender group Human Rights Watch published a report on the enforced disappearance of Bangladeshis. Referring to the incidents, Brad Adams, the Asia Director of the organization said: ‚ÄúThe Bangladesh government is making a habit of complete disregard for human rights, human life, and the rule of law.‚Äù On July 28, 2018, The New York Times published an opinion piece titled: ‚ÄúThe Opposition disappears in Bangladesh‚Äù on the incidents of enforced disappearance in Bangladesh.

After being observed apparently shoplifting, she had been confronted at the store's exit, but after a brief struggle broke free and fled. She has not been seen since. At the time, Whitton, who had a criminal record, was jobless, addicted to heroin and crystal methamphetamine, and in a difficult relationship with her boyfriend, Ashley Caudle, who was at the Walmart with her. He noted her failure to return that night, going to a nearby restaurant where she had worked to look for her, but did not contact the police or her family. Whitton's mother, who was used to her frequent and sometimes lengthy unexplained absences, went to the police in January 2014. The investigation is continuing, but while police say new leads come regularly, none of them have proven useful. Due to Caudle's criminal history, false statements about events that night he made later, and his failure to inform authorities or Whitton's family when he was unable to locate her, he is considered a person of interest. Currently serving a lengthy prison sentence for drug and gun charges, he denies any involvement in Whitton's disappearance or knowledge of her whereabouts. In 2016, journalist Tom Junod wrote an article about the case in Esquire, seeing the media silence on Whitton's case as an exception to what is called missing white woman syndrome. While Whitton is white, her troubled past and criminal record made her a less attractive subject to report on, he noted; her mother complained that some television shows that devote airtime to these cases had told her they were not interested in her daughter's disappearance. Junod also reported that Whitton's half-brother Blake said he received a phone call from her in January 2014, almost four months after she was last seen. Background Tiffany Michelle Whitton was born to Lisa Daniels in 1987; she and Whitton's father divorced soon afterwards. Daniels recalls her as \\"happy-go-lucky\\" and \\"rambunctious\\" during her early childhood in Kennesaw, a western suburb of Atlanta, but she also saw signs of her daughter's later issues. When Whitton was two, Daniels told Esquire in 2016, \\"I'd find things in her toy box that didn't belong to her.\\" Her daughter said that someone at day care had given her the toys; Daniels stated her daughter became a more accomplished liar as she got older. As she reached adulthood, Whitton grew more rebellious. She dropped out of high school during her sophomore year, putting an end to early ambitions of becoming a veterinarian. She relinquished for adoption a child from a teenage pregnancy, and she would later say that she was permanently affected by the experience. By 2008 she had had another child, a daughter, and started using drugs. She became addicted first to OxyContin and was caught shoplifting a pair of flip-flops from Walmart. Intermittently, she worked as a waitress or bartender; on Facebook she described herself as a Hooters waitress living in Kennesaw. In March 2011 Whitton, then living in the North Georgia town of Dalton, along with several others, was arrested and charged after a home invasion. Whitton told police that the victim had stolen $60 from her earlier that evening and she was merely trying to get it back; investigators, however, suspected it had been payment for drugs that the victim purportedly failed to deliver. Whitton was sentenced to a short prison term in late 2012. Daniels practiced tough love, raising her granddaughter and telling Whitton she could not talk to her again until she overcame her addictions and turned her life around. Her grandmother, Anita Boyette, remained in touch, picking Whitton up when she was released. She entered a drug rehabilitation facility shortly afterwards. After her release, she was able to stay off drugs and get a job waiting tables at an International House of Pancakes (IHOP) restaurant in Marietta. After one relationship ended due to her infidelity, and a roommate, Sheila Fuller, kicked her out for stealing, she met Ashley \\"Red\\" Caudle, who was raising a young daughter on his own. The two began using meth together; Whitton, however, also became addicted to heroin. Caudle, who told Esquire he does not use that drug, was unaware she had been using it until one morning when she told him while suffering withdrawal. Caudle and Whitton's relationship was, their friends said, characterized by frequent arguments. Police were called to one particularly loud dispute when the couple lived at a motel; no arrests were made. When they moved to a trailer park, their fights continued, and were so frequent and so loud that they were evicted. Whitton's addictions seriously hampered her work. She often showed up for her shifts at the restaurant high; sometimes fresh needle marks were apparent on her arms and she was sent home. In early August, after security camera footage showed that she had been stealing things, IHOP let her go. Daniels, as a result, ceased all contact with her daughter. Boyette stayed in touch, and on September 8 let Whitton, Caudle and his daughter come over to her house to do laundry. She was the only member of Whitton's family ever to meet her boyfriend, and the last one who saw her before her disappearance. Disappearance By the end of the summer Whitton and Caudle were living with his daughter in a house in Powder Springs. On the night of September 12, they went to the house of a friend, Stephen Weinstein, and took drugs. Shortly after midnight on September 13 they took a borrowed truck and went to the Walmart store on U.S. Route 41 in Marietta, near her former employer. They arrived at 1 a.m. and began shopping. Loss prevention officers in the store watched on security cameras as Whitton and Caudle walked around the store with a cart for most of the next hour. Whitton, who was in nearly continuous motion even when she was not looking at merchandise, seemed to them to be high. She continually took clothes off the shelves and replaced them, following a few steps behind Caudle, who eventually picked out some clothes for his daughter and a portable speaker. At the same time, the observers came to believe that Whitton was concealing some clothes she meant to shoplift, something she did often at that Walmart. At 2 a.m., Whitton wanted to continue the trip, but Caudle, in his account, told her he needed to be somewhere else, after which she angrily began heading for the cash registers while verbally acquiescing. After Caudle paid for his items with some bills from a large roll of cash he was carrying, she abandoned the cart and the two began to leave the store. At the exit, loss prevention officers confronted Whitton on suspicion of carrying $20 worth of stolen clothing; one grabbed the strap of her handbag to detain her. Caudle stopped at the door, facing forward; on video footage from the store's cameras she appears to call to Caudle but without a response. Whitton let go of her handbag, kicked off the flip-flops she was wearing, and ran out the exit. Neither Caudle nor the Walmart employees pursued her. She has not been seen again. Aftermath The video of the incident shows the loss prevention officers waiting at the door, expecting Whitton to return, as she had left her footwear and bag behind. Caudle, who had watched Whitton's apprehension passively from the door, is seen talking to her. Later, however, he told people he had gone to the truck, where he was charging his phone, gotten a weapon‚Äîa gun or a knife, in different accounts‚Äîand confronted the loss prevention officers, who let her go, whereupon she escaped out the door. He explained in 2016 that he had told those stories only to impress the people he was telling them to, Weinstein and a woman who visited him in prison. Caudle says that shortly after Whitton fled the store, he went out into the parking lot to look for her. He did not enter the truck, since he knew it had drugs in it and was afraid of arrest if he went in. He looked around the nearby stores, and some time later ended up at the IHOP where Whitton had worked until a month earlier. Sheila Fuller, Whitton's former roommate, recalls encountering Caudle sitting on a bench outside the restaurant sometime after 2 a.m. Fuller had not seen Whitton either, and told Caudle to call her phone and find her. He said he had been charging her phone, and showed it to Fuller. She questioned how he was looking for her by just sitting in front of IHOP; he answered that some friends were coming to pick him up shortly. An hour and a half later, Weinstein, accompanied by two women, pulled up and Caudle left with him. Weinstein says that Caudle, whom he describes as \\"full of shit and a piece of shit\\", but nonetheless pleasant company, told him about Whitton's absence, including how he had threatened the security guards at Walmart with a gun to get them to free her, which he doubted. However, he believed Caudle when he said he did not want to go back to his truck because of the drugs in it, and that he genuinely did not know where Whitton was. After returning to Weinstein's house, the two and another friend, he says, drove around the area looking for Whitton, who Caudle believed would eventually return to Weinstein's house. \\"I felt that he was telling the truth, other than the lying part\\", Weinstein said. The next morning Caudle drove back to the Powder Springs house where he, Whitton and his daughter lived. He spent the next several days trying to find her‚Äîcalling old boyfriends of hers, hospitals and jails in the area, calls verified by phone records. Two weeks later, he told his own probation officer that he had not been able to locate Whitton since that night, which records of the meeting confirm. Caudle also cleaned the truck, which later investigators took note of, but he insists he did that regularly due to the drug-related waste, such as used and discarded paraphernalia, left in it. Investigation Caudle, and later Whitton's mother, made some efforts to locate Whitton on their own in the months after September 13, believing she was alive and might eventually return, as she had after dropping out of sight in the past. In January 2014, after Whitton had not made any contact with Lisa Daniels or anyone else in the family, to her knowledge, she informed the police. =By Caudle and Daniels= Caudle did not inform Whitton's family of her disappearance, nor did he report it to the police. Lisa Daniels, who had not heard from her daughter since breaking off communications in August, was used to Whitton's long absences and expected she would hear from her eventually. In November a demand letter from a lawyer for Walmart seeking $150 in restitution for the items Whitton had apparently stolen the night of her disappearance arrived at her grandmother's house, which Whitton used as her mailing address since she moved so frequently. It was not the first time such a letter had been sent to her, but Boyette believed something might be amiss this time. Boyette knew too that Whitton often went on long drug binges, and that since she had been apprehended for shoplifting while still on parole from the 2011 charges, she was probably also trying to lower her profile for a time. Nevertheless, she called Caudle and learned not only of the September 13 incident that had prompted the letter but that he, too, had not seen Whitton since then. Boyette informed Daniels, who looked at her daughter's Facebook page for clues as to her whereabouts and possible activity. Normally very active on social media, Whitton had abruptly stopped posting on September 1. Messages from other friends and acquaintances since then indicated that they, too, had not heard from her and expressed concern. Daniels called Caudle before Thanksgiving; he told her of his calls to jails and hospitals in the days after Whitton disappeared. Daniels believed that perhaps, with the approaching winter holidays, her daughter would at least call her family. However, she did not, and in January 2014 Daniels and Boyette reported Whitton missing to the Marietta police. =By police= The initial detective who handled the case, according to Daniels, appeared not to take much interest in it. As she had feared, he cited Whitton's troubled past, telling Daniels that the case would likely be closed when her daughter either returned of her own volition or got arrested somewhere else. At the end of the month it was reassigned to another detective, Jonnie Moeller, who said later that she understood from her first conversation with Daniels that Whitton's case was not so typical. Moeller believed Whitton was probably dead, but the delay in reporting the case to police had made it difficult to mount an effective investigation. \\"It was already a cold case when it came to us\\" she told Esquire. After talking to Walmart, which had preserved the video as evidence in a possible prosecution or civil suit, and to Caudle, she came to believe he had been involved in Whitton's disappearance. In March, as a result of Moeller's investigation, a multi-jurisdictional drug-enforcement task force raided the Powder Springs house that had been Whitton's last known residence. The officers found marijuana, meth, and guns, amid an interior filled with dog feces and used needles. Eight people, including Caudle, were arrested on charges stemming from possessing those items; his daughter and another child were placed in the temporary custody of the local social services agency. Many of the other residents of the house besides Caudle had known Tiffany; Moeller believed that if Caudle did not know or would not tell police anything, others might. As a result of information developed from that raid, the same group of officers executed a search warrant in July 2014 on Caudle's mother's house in Marietta. Despite extensive excavation and searches with cadaver dogs, they found nothing that provided them with any leads. In 2015, Caudle pleaded guilty in Cherokee County to charges of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute and possessing a firearm while a convicted felon. He was sentenced to 10‚Äì20 years in prison, a minimum he was told by the judge resulted from a belief that he was not cooperating fully in the Whitton investigation. he is serving his sentence in Dooly State Prison at Unadilla. Later developments In mid-2015 the case was transferred to a third detective when Moeller, distressed over her inability to close the case, left the detective bureau to teach at the city's police academy. Her replacement, Mike Freer, managed to get what seemed to be a major break in the case later in the year when the Cobb County district attorney said a meth trafficker he had been prosecuting had heard from some of his friends that some time after Tiffany disappeared Caudle and some friends had driven up to Lake Allatoona north of the Atlanta area and thrown a concrete-filled barrel off the Bethany Bridge. The informant described damage to the bridge that matched what Freer found when he visited it. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources brought in sonar and found a large object under of water below the bridge damage. When state patrol divers went down to look, however, the object turned out to be a large chunk of concrete from the bridge's construction. This is to date the last official attempt to find Whitton, and in 2016 Marietta turned the case over to the county's new cold case squad. =Esquire story= In April 2016 Esquire magazine published an article about Whitton's disappearance. Reporter Tom Junod was interested in the cases of women who do not trigger what has sometimes been called \\"missing white woman syndrome\\", where the media devotes excessive coverage to their cases. Even though the women are white, Junod believes they are ignored due to their troubled backgrounds. \\"[M]edia outlets ... tend to prefer women who are white, pretty, and, above all, innocent\\", Junod wrote. He chose Whitton's case from 13 stories of similar women he was aware of, all of whom had gone missing over a three-year period with only three of them found‚Äîand all of those dead. Daniels told him she had tried to interest the producers of some shows that devoted segments to missing persons cases in covering her daughter's disappearance, and they told her they were not interested. She likened the process to an audition. In addition to Daniels, Junod interviewed Boyette, Caudle, Fuller, Weinstein, and all the detectives who had investigated the case. He not only noted Caudle's lies about pulling a weapon when Tiffany was confronted by the loss prevention officers, but caught him in another one: he said he called Tiffany's phone shortly after she disappeared, yet according to his first account he had it on his person, since it had been left behind in her handbag when she fled the Walmart. Fuller corroborated the claim as he had showed it to her after she suggested he call Whitton when they met outside the IHOP; Caudle's phone records do not show a call to Whitton's phone either. The phone led to another revelation, however. According to Whitton's half-brother Blake, she wished him a happy birthday on Facebook five days after he had celebrated the occasion, which Daniels dismisses as proof that Caudle was using Whitton's phone to create the impression she was still alive. But Blake told Junod she called him as well. Blake recalled that it came via an app \\"with a weird return number\\". He had almost let it go unanswered. He was positive it was his half-sister since she even called him by a childhood nickname. While Junod believed that Blake was not lying, he was not sure that Blake was accurate in his recollection, possibly confusing the Facebook message in time with an earlier phone conversation. The Cobb County district attorney said it would try to obtain Blake's phone records. Theories Daniels has long believed Whitton is dead and Caudle is responsible, due to his failure to let her or the police know of her disappearance. \\"He knows what happened to her and he knows where she is\\", she told The Atlanta Journal‚ÄìConstitution in 2017. \\"Of that I have no doubt.\\" Daniels was further convinced when she viewed a recording of a prison videophone conversation Caudle had with a female visitor. In it he waves around a copy of Whitton's missing-person flyer that Moeller had brought to him and holds it up to the camera, all the while speaking confidently, unlike the way Junod recalled him. \\"They think I killed that bitch for real!\\" he says, and then laughs. After her prison interview, Moeller told Junod that she, too, had no doubt that he had. Investigators consider him a suspect. In Daniels' theory, Whitton would have gone straight for Caudle's truck. \\"Either they had a fight and he killed her, or she overdosed and he did nothing.\\" However, the district attorney's office says the case does not fit the typical pattern of a death by drug overdose, since most victims do not disappear afterwards. Attempts to fix blame on Caudle are complicated, however, by the short time between when he left Walmart shortly after Whitton did, and when Fuller saw him on the bench outside the IHOP. For him to have killed Whitton, either deliberately or accidentally, and then hidden her body so well that no sign of it has ever turned up in that brief span of time, would require \\"sadistic efficiency and nearly miraculous competence\\", Junod wrote. Daniels also believes her daughter would have vigorously resisted had someone attempted to kill her. While Caudle says cameras at several stores in the area would have recorded his passage across US 41 to the restaurant, no footage showing it has been found. \\"She just ran. I don't know what happened to her\\", Caudle told Junod, who notes the irony that the person widely suspected of killing Whitton is the only one who believes she is still alive. He admitted that the couple argued, often vehemently, but that those arguments never became violent. If he is guilty of anything, Caudle said, it is not a crime but failure to look after Whitton properly. If foul play did befall Whitton, Caudle has a suspect of his own, a former boyfriend of hers who also was a heavy meth user. He notes that after he and Weinstein returned to the latter's house in the morning after they had looked for Whitton and taken more drugs, the friend stayed out in the parking lot. In December 2013, the man, having an apparent psychotic episode, kicked down the door of a neighboring house at 4 a.m., insisting that he was being chased by armed men bent on exacting revenge on him for something they believed he had done to a woman, until he was taken away by the police.

These businesses benefit and profit from cheap prison labor, food services, medical services, surveillance technology, and construction. The financial incentive of building prisons encourages incarceration and affects people of color at disproportionately high rates. Native Americans are the largest group per capita in the US prison system and are more likely to be affected by police violence than any other racial group.  Incarceration statistics  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Native Americans are incarcerated at a rate 38% higher than the national average. In 19 states, Indigenous people are overrepresented in the prison population compared to any other race and ethnicity. Between 2010 and 2015, the number of Native Americans incarcerated in federal prisons increased by 27%. In Alaska, data published by the 2010 US Census reveal that 38% of incarcerated people are American Indian or Alaskan Native while only 15% of the total population is. In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians only make up 24% of the general population. However, they account for 39% of the incarcerated population according to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Native youth are highly impacted by the US prison system; despite accounting for 1% of the national youth population, 70% of youth taken into federal prison are Native American. Native American men are admitted to prison at four times the rate of white men while Native women are admitted at 6 times the rate of white women. Effects of US intervention on tribal governments Due to a complicated legal history of the United States interceding and dismantling tribal justice systems, tribal governments have much more limited jurisdiction compared to federal justice systems and US state systems. The Major Crimes Act in 1885, Public Law 280 in 1953, The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 and the case law of Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe in 1978 are some of the first historic laws among many passed by the United States government to gain federal control over native nations. This has disrupted the autonomy of tribal justice systems today and has caused the crime on Native reservations to often be prosecuted under federal law which entails more severe sentencing than state law for the same crime. Non-native criminals including sexual predators and drug traffickers have taken advantage of the unclear chain of authority on Native lands. This disjuncture between federal government jurisdiction and tribal government jurisdiction allows non-native criminals to avoid punishment while Native members are subjected to sexual and drug violence.  Police violence against Native Americans  Police brutality against Native Americans contributes greatly to the rising incarceration rates and deaths of Native people. While Native Americans only make up 1.2% of the total population in the US, Natives experience higher rates of death due to police violence than any other racial group. Native Americans are 3 times more likely than white Americans to be killed by police.  Advocacy  = Native Lives Matter = The \\"Native Lives Matter\\" campaign is a grassroots group advocating for awareness and justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women and Native lives killed by police violence. The campaign was established in 2014 by Akicita Sunka-Wakan Ska from the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux Tribes and JR Bobick from St. Paul, Minnesota. This campaign uses social media like Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness about issues affecting the Native population, such as police brutality, high incarceration, and missing murdered indigenous women. The campaign believes ways to lessen and end police brutality and high incarceration rates include hiring a police force that better represents Native communities. This would allow for more cultural understanding and lead to less racial profiling against tribal nations by police enforcement. Native Lives Matter also believes that cultural healing programs could address and eventually lessen police brutality by fostering an understanding of mental health, addiction, and poverty which contribute to high police presence.

It gives an \\"if and only if\\" characterisation of when two such measures are equivalent, and hence it is extremely useful when trying to establish change-of-measure formulae for measures on function spaces. The result is due to the Japanese mathematician Shizuo Kakutani. Kakutani's theorem can be used, for example, to determine whether a translate of a Gaussian measure mu is equivalent to mu (only when the translation vector lies in the Cameron‚ÄìMartin space of mu), or whether a dilation of mu is equivalent to mu (only when the absolute value of the dilation factor is 1, which is part of the Feldman‚ÄìH√°jek theorem). Statement of the theorem For each n in mathbb{N}, let mu_{n} and u_{n} be measures on the real line mathbb{R}, and let mu = bigotimes_{n in mathbb{N}} mu_n and u = bigotimes_{n in mathbb{N}} u_n be the corresponding product measures on mathbb{R}^infty. Suppose also that, for each n in mathbb{N}, mu_n and u_n are equivalent (i.e. have the same null sets). Then either mu and u are equivalent, or else they are mutually singular. Furthermore, equivalence holds precisely when the infinite product :prod_{n in mathbb{N}} int_{mathbb{R}} sqrt{ frac{mathrm{d} mu_n} {mathrm{d} u_n} } , mathrm{d} u_n has a nonzero limit; or, equivalently, when the infinite series :sum_{n in mathbb{N}} log int_{mathbb{R}} sqrt{ frac{mathrm{d} mu_n}{mathrm{d} u_n} } , mathrm{d} u_n converges.

He is perhaps best known as a talented amateur bullfighter, and as a pioneer of photography in Portugal. Biography Carlos Relvas was born in the Outeiro Palace, in Goleg√£, a small village in the rural province of Ribatejo in Portugal. His father, Jos√© Farinha Relvas de Campos was one of the wealthiest landowners in Ribatejo. He was educated by private tutors in science and foreign languages, namely French. Carlos Relvas's photographic studio, in the 1870s Carlos Relvas inherited a veritable fortune and extensive land from his parents, but was always held in high regard for his charitability. Of an artistic disposition, he soon turned to photography. In 1876, he had an opulent atelier built in one of his properties in Goleg√£, and bought several of the most modern photographic apparatuses from all over Europe. His photographic works became very well known and highly valued in Portugal: it did not take long until Carlos Relvas was considered the finest amateur photographer in the country. He became a member of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie, and many of his photographs were showcased in several exhibitions, both national and abroad, and won many prizes: * Progress Medal (Vienna, 1873) * Silver Medal (Madrid, 1873) * Silver Medal (Vienna Photographic Society, 1875) * Medal (Philadelphia, 1876) * First Prize (Amsterdam, 1876) * Gold Medal (Horticultural Exhibition at the Crystal Palace of Oporto, 1877) * Gold Medal (Exhibition of the Union centrale des Arts d√©coratifs, Palais de l'Industrie, Paris) Carlos Relvas bullfighting on horseback, on an 1887 painting by Jos√© Malhoa He also became a notable sportsman, a perfect gentleman-rider: a habile marksman, fencer, and horse rider. He also became a famous amateur bullfighter, both as a cavaleiro (on horseback) and as a bandarilheiro. An enthusiast of the sport, he had a bullring built in Goleg√£, and frequently took part in bullfighting spectacles for charity: profits from the opening performance of the Goleg√£ arena reverted to the local hospital, and his last performance, in 1893, was to aid the victims of the 1893 Azores hurricane. In 1853, at age 15, Carlos Relvas married D. Margarida Am√°lia Mendes de Vasconcelos, the daughter of the Counts of Podentes, one of the most illustrious families in Beira Alta, and the couple had four children ‚Äî most notably Jos√© Relvas, a republican politician who actively participated in the 5 October 1910 revolution, and who briefly served as the country's Prime Minister in 1919. His wife died in 1887 and, one year later, he married Mariana Correia, a marriage that was not accepted by the entirety of his family. The couple moved to Carlos Relvas's photograpic studio, now repurposed as a house, where they lived until Relvas's death on 23 January 1894, after contracting sepsis following a horse-riding accident.

Publication history It was first published in trade paperback by Starblaze/The Donning Company in March 1983, with later trade paperback editions following from Starmont House (1988), Borgo Press (1989) and Wildside Press (1999). The first hardcover edition was issued by Starmont House in 1988, followed by the Science Fiction Book Club in 2000. The first ebook edition was issued by Wildside Press in June 2015. The first British edition was published in paperback by New English Library in March 1996. It has been translated into Italian and French. Summary The story explores the fate of a magic-ridden far future Earth at the end of an age of chaotic miracles between the death of the world's latest divinity, the Goddess, and the birth of a new one, chronicling the struggle over the nature the next deity will take and thus that of the world itself. The immense corpse of the Goddess is preserved as a relic beneath the sacred city of Ai Hanlo, presided over by its saintly ruler Tharanodeth, guardian of the Goddess's bones. Unknown to him, a malevolent witch has designs on his city and the holiness it guards. Feigning death, she sacrifices her eyes to a demon for power in a complex scheme that allows her soul to possess Tharanodeth's infant son Kaemen. The soul is delivered by a similcrum child created around the eyes, which is then abandoned in the Kaemen's nursery as a foundling. The court wizard Hadel, suspecting the foundling a threat, advises doing away with him, but Tharanodeth intervenes, protecting him and naming him Ginna. Kaemen and Ginna both grow up in the palace, the former, under the witch's spell, becoming willful, cruel and selfish, while the latter is a blank slate whose passive innocence leads Tharanodeth to prefer him to his own son. When the boys are twelve, Tharanodeth dies, and Kaemen takes his place as ruler. Ginna continues to live a neglected existence in the palace, taught by Hadel and befriended by a young girl. After three years the boy and girl flee Ai Hanlo and Kaemen's increasingly capricious tyranny, which is ushering in an apocalypse of blood and darkness. They fall in with a merchant caravan and later a ship manned by mystical warriors as the darkness spreading from the city taints and changes the world, engulfing humanity and awakening long- buried monsters and horrors. Ginna gains knowledge and some power during his journey, but despairs of making a difference. He reaches the goal of his quest, an otherworldly grove of light watched over by the spirit of the Goddess's mother, and learns the secret of the horror overtaking the world and his own origin and purpose. His destiny brings him into direct conflict with the doomed Kaemen and the malign vision of his witch-creator, with the outcome of the struggle to decide the fate of the world and the nature of the deity that will preside over its next phase. Will it be one of death and decay, or is some kind of redemption possible? Relation to other works Schweitzer subsequently explored the age prior to the events of the book in a cycle of short stories collected in Echoes of the Goddess (2013), which serve as a prequel to the novel. Reception Mary Gentle writing in Vector, assessed the book's quality as follows: \\"Few writers can genuinely touch the quality of nightmare. By that I don't mean the cataloguing of horror and gore that blurb- writers so often refer to as nightmare-like, but the fear that formless and almost banal stems from the sleeping mind. John Bellairs did it with The Face in the Frost ... James Blaylock can do it. And now there is also The Shattered Goddess.Gentle, Mary. Review in Vector 116, Oct. 1983, p. 35. W. Paul Ganley in Fantasy Mongers: \\"Compelling, intriguing characters, moody, haunting, persuasive . . . fierce imagery containing equal parts legend and fantasy; distinctly different.\\"Ganley, W. Paul. Review in Fantasy Mongers 8, Fall 1983, p. 6.

Canary Mission listings have been used by the Israeli government and border security officials to interrogate and deny entry to pro- Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) US citizens, and by potential employers. Individuals listed by Canary have said it is a blacklist designed to intimidate students, faculty members, and community activists engaged in Palestine solidarity work. Some pro-Israel activists consider the site's tactics to be overly aggressive, while others applaud its efforts against pro- Palestinian activists. The operators of the website have maintained their anonymity, justifying their secrecy by saying that \\"many of our detractors just want to know who we are so they can physically harm us.\\"  Activity  According to their website, Canary Mission \\"documents individuals and organizations that promote hatred of the US, Israel and Jews on North American college campuses\\". The profiles on the website are constructed using publicly visible information pulled from social media sites. The profiles are often quite detailed and have included personal information, such as child photos of individuals. The website has thousands of profiles of students and professors who its editors believe have engaged in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israel activism, and it has been described as a blacklist. It also includes a handful of profiles for prominent white supremacists. Canary Mission hosts some apology essays written by people whose profiles were listed on the site; in return, their profiles are removed from the website's list. = Timeline = In December 2017, Canary Mission reported on what it alleged antisemitic tweets posted by students associated with Solidarity for Palestinian Human Rights (SPHR) at McMaster University. The tweets were written between 2011 and 2017, and contained support for Hitler as well as calls for death of Israel and Zionists. SPHR in response said it \\"condemns all forms of anti-Semitism within our organization\\", and that the referenced comments were \\"intolerable in every sense\\". The university actively reviewed the \\"disturbing social media post\\", but did not publish the results of its review since \\"it is not our practice to provide details of any actions taken or sanctions applied with regard to individual students\\". In April 2018, during a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign at George Washington University, flyers with Canary Mission's logo were posted around the university denouncing a planned student senate vote. On the day of the vote, two adult men wearing canary costumes performed a dance in the lobby of the building where the vote was taking place. In September 2018, Canary Mission released a report on the vote, highlighting reputed antisemitic and anti-Israel tactics used to promote the vote. In May 2018, Canary Mission released a report on social media posts by Students for Justice in Palestine chapter members at Florida State University, saying that 36% of the social media posts by SJP members were \\"endorsements or promotion of terror as well as calls for intifada and violence against Jews\\". The FSU SJP chapter subsequently released a statement writing that they \\"entirely condemn and denounce the racist, anti-Black, and anti-Semitic statements made by some of the individuals who were previous students and members of our SJP chapter,\\" however commenting that some of the social media posts were \\"legitimate criticisms of Israeli governmental policies and practices, even though they are presented as anti-Semitic.\\" According to Canary Mission, FSU SJP's response did not condemn social media posts that \\"called for intifada and violence against Jews.\\"  Use of Canary Mission listings  The Israeli security services have reportedly used content from Canary Mission to screen profiled individuals at Ben Gurion Airport. They also have reportedly used claims made on the website to justify decisions to deport people from Israel. Profiles hosted on Canary Mission may harm the employment opportunities of those listed, particularly students and untenured faculty, by exposing their statements to potential employers in a readily available online profile.Boycott!: The Academy and Justice for Palestine, University of California Press, Sunaina Maira, page 94 According to W.J.T. Mitchell, who has a Canary Mission profile, prospective employers see Canary Mission profiles appear at the top of Google search results for students and recent alumni who do not have a \\"very deep set of achievements\\".The Trolls of Academe: Making Safe Spaces into Brave Spaces, Los Angeles Review of Books, W. J. T. Mitchell, 5 January 2018  Structure  Canary Mission does not publish any information about who runs or funds the website. Although Canary Mission's website claims that it is a nonprofit organization, no organization with the name Canary Mission is registered with the IRS. Though Canary Mission's website does provide a way to donate to the organization via debit or credit card, there is no public record of Canary Mission's sponsors and/or donors. Multiple pro- Israel organizations have denied having any affiliation with Canary Mission. According to Edwin Black, extreme antisemitic comments as well as outright threats of violence have been directed towards Canary Mission. Following the threats, Canary Mission became even more cautious and avoided disclosing its physical location or identity. According to Canary Mission's blog, \\"many of our detractors just want to know who we are so they can physically harm us,\\" which according to Black has caused Canary Mission to restrict its communications with Journalists. Black, who says he was able to verify Canary Mission's location and operations, says they are a group of students and ex- students working in a medium-sized office in an American city.Inside Canary Mission, Edwin Black, 5 November 2016 Funding In October 2018, The Forward and Haaretz reported that Canary Mission received funding from the Hellen Diller Family Foundation, a supporting foundation of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco (JCFSF), and that the organization's operations were headed by Jonathan Bash through an Israeli charity named Megamot Shalom. Soon after the exposure, JCFSF announced that they would cease funding Canary Mission. The Forward also identified the Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles as a major donor to Megamot Shalom, having donated a sum of $250,000 in 2016‚Äì2017. The Lobby ‚Äì USA, an undercover investigation by Al Jazeera into Israel‚Äôs covert influence campaign in the United States, reported that Adam Milstein was the major funding source for Canary Mission.  Reception  The Forward reported that while some of the profiles include content that is \\"genuinely troubling\\", such as antisemitic social media posts, other accusations made by the website are misleading. One such profile accused a student of \\"demonizing Israel\\" because the student had made an announcement at a Hillel-sponsored dinner critical of Donald Trump's decision to move the United States embassy to Jerusalem. According to Israeli attorney Emily Schaeffer Omer-Man, Canary Mission's information is \\"often neither reliable, nor complete, nor up to date\\". She said that the site should not be used by Israeli border officials as it does not meet the reliability standards mandated by Israeli law. Pro-Palestinian sources have denounced Canary Mission's activities as an attempt to silence critics of Israel on American college campuses through intimidation. In response, pro-Palestinian activists have started a website called \\"Against Canary Mission\\", and say they intend to host profiles of people targeted by Canary Mission in order to portray their activism in a positive light. Various critics have compared Canary Mission's practice of extorting apologies from targeted individuals in exchange for amnesty to that of authoritarian regimes and McCarthyism in the United States. Some pro-Israel organizations have also criticized Canary Mission for its aggressive tactics. Jewish and pro-Israeli students have said that pro- Palestinian students and faculty have suspected them of colluding with Canary Mission, blaming them even when they were not involved with Canary. The Israel on Campus Coalition has endorsed Canary Mission, writing that \\"through online platforms such as Canary Mission, a database devoted to exposing hatred of Jews and Israel, the pro-Israel community has established a strong deterrent against anti-Semitism and BDS activism\\". In February 2018, Twitter briefly suspended Canary Mission's account, for exposing a 2017 tweet by a pro- Palestinian activist that \\"modified Adele's lyrics to say \\"Set Fire to the Jews\\". According to Twitter, they made an error in blocking Canary. In October 2019, Ray Hanania commented about the Canary Mission: > \\"Imagine the outrage that would be expressed if there was a website that > maintained a public list of Jews, publishing their photos and personal > information simply because they were active supporters of Israel. Well, you > would have to imagine it because it doesn't exist. But you don't have to > imagine a website that shows the photos and personal information of Arab > Americans who support Palestinian rights and is filled with vicious > accusations of them being \\"anti-Semitic\\" and even \\"anti-American.\\"  References   External links  * Canary Mission website * Against Canary Mission website Organizations established in 2014 Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict American political websites ","title":"Canary Mission"},{"id":"58350887","title":"National Environmental Award (Spain)"},{"id":"58350898","text":"J√°nos Nagy may refer to: * J√°nos Nagy (diplomat) (born 1928), Hungarian diplomat and politician * J√°nos Nagy (footballer) (born 1992), Hungarian footballer * J√°nos Nagy (wrestler) * J√°nos Nagy (boxer) ","title":"J√°nos Nagy"},{"id":"58350907","text":"The Treaty of Madrid (1880) was a collection of agreements between Morocco, under the rule of Hassan I, and many European powers, to give the powers the ownership of Moroccan lands they had seized, the resources present on these lands, settlement rights and to employ locals on these lands. This treaty served to regulate and make these conquests official in the international community.  Summary  The treaty consisted of 18 articles: Treaties/agreements signed previously, with Britain, Spain and France, remained in force, with modifications set out in this treaty. Foreign Officials residing in Morocco were given permission to employ Moroccans, and enjoyed 'protection', i.e. freedom from taxation, as did their families, their Moroccan employees and any Consulate employees who were Moroccan. Employees who worked as farmers, servants, interpreters or other menial jobs were not protected, even if they were not Moroccan. Any Foreign Nationals who owned farmed land or were farmers had to pay agricultural tax, and any who owned and used pack animals or load carrying had to pay 'gate tax', but in both situations foreign nationals were exempt from other taxes. Foreign Officials could not employ soldiers or Moroccan Officials, or Moroccans undergoing criminal prosecution. Foreign Nationals could purchase or obtain land with the prior permission of the Moroccan Government, and as such the land would remain under Moroccan jurisdiction. Foreign Governments could choose any 12 Moroccans to be protected for whatever reason they desired without permission of the Moroccan Government, but had to seek permission if they wanted to protect any more.

Discovery The type species, Pilmatueia faundezi, was described in 2018 by Rodolfo Coria and colleagues. The genus name is derived from the Pilmatu√© locality, where the material was collected, and the species epithet faundezi was chosen in recognition of Ram√≥n Fa√∫ndez, manager of the Museo Municipal de Las Lajas, who supported the excavation project. Pilmatueia is the first recognized Valangininan dicraeosaurid and is the earliest recorded Cretaceous dicraeosaurid. It was part of a South American Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous dicraeosaurid radiation. The fossils were recovered as early as 2009 in a layer of the Mulichinco Formation (Valanginian, Lower Cretaceous, Neuqu√©n Basin, Argentina) and is based on isolated skeletal remains collected from a single stratigraphic level, relatively close to each other, with unquestionable dicraeosaurid features in the axial elements. Description Pilmatueia faundezi is diagnosed by a unique combination of several features that include cervico-dorsal vertebrae with dorsoventrally oriented ridges on the anterior surfaces of the anterior centrodiapophyseal laminae, and posterior dorsal vertebrae with deep fossae at the bases of the bifid neural spines separated by a thick, low, sagittal lamina.

It is in the Castanea genus that includes chestnuts and types of chestnut known as chinkapins. Some authorities consider it a variant of the Allegheny chinkapin (C. pumila) as C. pumila ozarkensis. It grows in the Ozark Mountains and Ouachita Mountains of Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The nuts it produces provided food for indigenous people, early settlers, and various animals including squirrel, chipmunk, deer, turkey, and bobwhite. Castanea ozarkensis is susceptible to chestnut blight and has been devastated by the disease, and largely now grows only as a small tree or shrub. However, several mature individuals have survived the blight, with over 45 such individuals located so far since the 2000s. The discovery of these specimens has spurred an ongoing project to restore the species by using the offspring of these trees, headed by the Ozark Chinkapin Foundation. An analysis has also found that Ozark chinkapin populations contain far more genetic diversity than those of the American chestnut, which was also devastated by the chestnut blight. The study also found that the Ozark chinkapin may actually be ancestral to the American chestnut and Allegheny chinkapin, rather than the other way around. Another study has found that the surviving Ozark chinkapins are even more resistant to the chestnut blight than the Chinese chestnut, which is not affected by the blight. Castanea ozarkensis was described by William Willard Ashe and published in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club 50 (11): 360-361. 1923.

He is best known for his work in developing and manufacturing the drug that became known as Botox, research described as \\"groundbreaking\\" by the ASCRS. Scott initially developed botulinum type A neurotoxin (botulinum toxin) to treat strabismus, naming it Oculinum‚Ñ¢ (‚Äúeye aligner‚Äù). He was fascinated by the prospect of turning \\"a deadly poison into a miracle drug for obscure but devastating eye diseases‚Äù. The cosmetic application was discovered by accident, during its original use as ophthalmalic treatment. Botox, dubbed ‚Äúmedicine‚Äôs answer to duct tape‚Äù, has been found to be effective for muscle spasms and contractures, severe sweating and drooling, migraines, urinary incontinence, and many other disorders. In pursuit of new ways to help his patients, Scott made many basic scientific advances concerning eye muscles, their coordination, and their modifiability. Scott wanted to treat strabismus with a simple, low cost injection, rather than with conventional surgery under general anesthesia. To reach muscles behind the eye for injection, Scott and colleagues developed EMG-guided injection, which monitors muscle activity to guide needle placement. Education Scott attended medical school at the University of California, San Francisco (1956). He interned at the University of Minnesota, in surgery (1956-1957), where he also completed a residency (1957-1958) in neurological surgery. Scott completed a residency in ophthalmology at Stanford University Medical Center (1958-1961). Professional experience Scott served as a Senior Scientist at the Smith- Kettlewell Research Institute, from 1961-2013, and as Director from 1982-2004. From 1997-2006, he was Vice Chair of Ophthalmology at the California Pacific Medical Center. He founded the Strabismus Research Foundation in San Francisco, and has served as Director and Senior Scientist since 2013. He has served as Senior Scientist at Eidactics, since 2013. Scott has published numerous articles on the subject of strabismus. Major contributions =Botulinum toxin treatment of eye muscles= Strabismus is a disorder of eye movement and alignment caused by imbalances in the actions of muscles that rotate the eyes. In many cases these imbalances can be corrected by weakening a muscle that pulls too strongly, or that has normal activity but overpowers an opposing muscle that has been weakened by disease or trauma. Conventional treatments are surgical, which restore balance by compensatory impairment: tissue is removed to tighten a muscle, and muscles are moved to relax them or to sacrifice one direction of action for another. Muscles adapt to the lengths at which they are chronically held, so if a paralyzed muscle is stretched by its antagonist, it grows longer, while the antagonist shortens, yielding a permanent effect. With good binocular vision, the brain mechanism of motor fusion (which aligns the eyes on a target visible to both) helps stabilize the corrected alignment. Strabismus surgery has the undesirable side effect of scarring, which makes frequently needed followup surgeries more difficult, and may generally compromise the eye‚Äôs mechanics. Non-surgical injection treatments using various anesthetics, alcohols, enzymes, enzyme blockers, and snake neurotoxins were therefore tried. Finally, inspired by Daniel Drachman‚Äôs work with chicks at Johns Hopkins, Dr Scott and colleagues injected botulinum toxin into monkey extraocular muscles. The result was remarkable: a few picograms induced paralysis that was confined to the target muscle, long in duration, and without side-effects. Botox is formed by spores of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which is found naturally in sediments as well as the intestinal tracts of some animals and fish. The drug binds to receptors in skeletal muscle, nerve endings, the brain, and some smooth muscle, preventing the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. By blocking nerves from sending signals to the muscle to contract, Botox essentially paralyzes the muscles temporarily. After working-out techniques for preparing the toxin and assuring its sterility, potency, and safety, Scott was granted FDA approval for investigational use, and began manufacturing it in his San Francisco lab. He injected the first strabismus patients in 1977, reported its clinical utility, and had soon trained hundreds of ophthalmologists in EMG-guided injection of the drug he named OculinumTM (‚Äúeye aligner‚Äù). Based on data from thousands of patients collected by 240 investigators, under the 1983 US Orphan Drug Act, Scott obtained FDA approval in 1989 to market Oculinum for clinical use in the United States to treat adult strabismus and blepharospasm. With the wide acceptance of OculinumTM, Dr. Scott had to ‚Äúdecide if he wanted to be in the pharmaceutical business business or be a research scientist‚Äù. In 1991 he therefore sold rights to the drug to the pharmaceutical company Allergan, which rebranded it as Botox¬Æ. Allergan, which markets ocular-care products, purchased the rights to Oculinum in order to service the \\"niche population\\" of stabismus patients, for $9M. Botox received FDA approval for cosmetic treatments in 2002. However, the majority of the drug's sales are made for theraputic treatments. =Botulinum toxin treatment of other muscle disorders= By 1982, eye muscles had been injected for strabismus and nystagmus (jerky, involuntary eye movements), eyelid muscles for retraction and blepharospasm (sustained, involuntary contractions of muscles around the eye), facial muscles for hemifacial spasm, and limb muscles for dystonia (sustained muscle spasm), all as predicted in Scott‚Äôs 1973 study. Scott also injected the first cases of the painful, spastic twisting of the neck known as torticollis, but it was difficult to accept that the spedcificity and molecular tenacity that made ingested toxin so deadly also made it safe when injected into a target muscle, and no Bay Area physician would try Botox for the muscle contractures of stroke, dystonia, torticollis, or cerebral palsy, until L. Andrew Koman of Wake Forest University in North Carolina pioneered its use to treat pediatric leg spasm in cerebral palsy. Patient groups quickly spread the word that there were now effective treatments for previously untreatable motility disorders such as blepharospasm, which can result in functional blindness despite an otherwise normal visual system. Torticollis patients discovered that their pain could be markedly reduced, motility increased, and head position improved by toxin injection. But, in 1986, Oculinum Inc, Scott's micromanufacturer and distributor of botulinum toxin, was unable to obtain product liability insurance, and could no longer supply the drug. As stocks became exhausted, patients who had come to rely on periodic injections became desperate. For 4 months, pending resolution of liability issues, American blepharospasm patients traveled to Canadian eye centers for their injections.Boffey, P., Loss of drug relegates many to blindness again, in The New York Times. 1986. =Electrically guided injection= Precisely targeted eye muscle injections are useful for both diagnosis and treatment, but the bodies of the 6 muscles that rotate the eye lie close together, adjacent to the eyeball, and are not normally visible. Scott and colleagues therefore developed EMG-guided injection, a system that uses a hypodermic needle that records the electrical activity of the muscle (the electromyogram or EMG) at its tip. The needle is introduced under local anesthesia, and as the awake patient looks in different directions, the pattern of muscle activity, played through a speaker, indicates when the belly of the target muscle has been entered, and the drug is then injected. If the patient is not awake, movement-related EMG cannot be recorded. Scott and colleagues therefore developed another system in which the injection needle stimulates, rather than records, producing characteristic eye movements that identify the muscle in which the needle is placed. =Strengthening eye muscles= Botox injection can weaken and lengthen muscles, but weak, stretched muscles are often the primary problem in strabismus. Scott is therefore now developing the anesthetic drug bupivacaine as an injection to strengthen and shorten weak muscles. Bupivacaine injection stresses a muscle and triggers a growth process, analogous to how load-bearing exercise builds skeletal muscles. Clinical studies over the past decade have demonstrated that bupivacaine injection in a weak muscle has a synergistic effect with Botox injected in its opposing muscle, resulting in permanent strabismus cures in many more cases. Laboratory studies are underway to better understand the cellular effects of bupivacaine injection, and optimize its therapeutic benefits. =Blepherospasm= Blepharospasm is the uncontrollable closure of the eyes, which can leave sufferers functionally blind, despite the visual system itself being normal. The cause is unknown, and it may be present from birth or develop later in life. Botox injection can relieve the spasms, but leave patients unable to open their eyes or keep them open. Surgical lid elevation is the current treatment, but static repositioning impairs normal eye blinking and lid closure. Electrically stimulating the muscle that raises the eyelid could provide these patients with useful vision, and would be far superior to surgery, both functionally and cosmetically. Dr Scott and his colleagues have therefore developed electrodes that are both safe and effective in animals tested with realistic, long-term stimulation regimens. Implantable pulse generators, approved for other applications, would be suitable to power and control these electrodes. =Pragmatic Research= Scott intends his research to be ‚Äúdirectly helpful to people‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere are interesting and difficult problems still to be solved‚Äù, he explains, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm a practicing physician and I see them every day‚Äù. The uniform patient populations and standardized treatments of controlled, so-called ‚Äúexplanatory‚Äù research are indeed essential for testing scientific hypotheses and finding small differences. But explanatory research treats patients as means more than ends. ‚ÄúPragmatic research‚Äù, such as Scott‚Äôs, studies typical, rather than selected patients, and gives treatments customized to patients needs, rather than standardized test treatments. Such research is sometimes considered only preliminary, but the results of pragmatic research are generalizable to broader patient populations, greater treatment variations, and are more likely to have real-world significance in decisions about how best to help people.

Mark Heywood QC represented the Crown in this case involving the plot by two individuals to kill the Prime Minister. Rahman was originally from Birmingham, but lived in Finchley at the time of his sentencing. Rahman had planned to detonate bombs at the gates of Downing Street and then behead the Prime Minister, but was arrested beforehand due to an FBI and MI5 operation. Rahman was arrested in November 2017 in London, after collecting a fake bomb and suicide vest from undercover operatives. He was found guilty at the Old Bailey in July 2018 of conspiracy to commit terrorism and creating extremist material for recruitment purposes. In August 2018, he was given a life sentence and jailed for at least 30 years, with another 6 year sentence for the sponsorship video. The sentences will run concurrently. Personal background Rahman was originally from Birmingham of Bangladeshi descent, but grew up in Walsall. In 2017, Rahman was made homeless in London after falling out with his mother and close relatives. He lived in Finchley at the time of his arrest. In 2015, he was referred to a deradicalisation scheme amid concerns he could be radicalised by his extremist uncle, Musadikur Rohaman. Rohaman left the UK for Syria in 2014 and had been encouraging Rahman to engage in extremist activity. Rohaman was killed in a drone strike in June 2017, and it is believed that Rahman planned his revenge thereafter. August 2017 arrest Rahman first came to police attention in August 2017, when he was arrested on suspicion of sending indecent images to underage girls. He was not charged, but police became aware of extremist material after searching his phone. Theresa May assassination attempt In September 2017, Rahman made contact with an FBI agent on social media, believing him to be an Islamic State recruiter. He was then referred to a team of MI5 role players, who convinced him they were Islamic State leaders. The team then introduced Rahman to an undercover police officer in London posing as \\"Shaq\\", a weapons fixer. When meeting the officer, Rahman explained his aspirations and considered attacking with firemans and a truck bomb. He settled for storming Downing Street and killing Theresa May. In November 2017, Rahman met with and laid out his final plan to the undercover officer. The recording of the meeting was played in court: On 18 November 2017, Rahman carried out reconnaissance around Whitehall. Two days later he bought a rucksack from Argos, and then met with an undercover officer in Brixton to have it and a jacket fitted with explosives. On 28 November 2017, the officer met with Rahman in Kensington and returned the jacket and bag with fake explosives. Rahman then left the scene, stating that he was \\"good to go\\". Within moments, he was surrounded by police and arrested.  Islamic State sponsorship video On or before 28 November 2017, Rahman recorded a \\"sponsorship video\\" for his friend Mohammad Aqib Imran to help him join Islamic State in Syria. In February 2019, Imran was sentenced to eight-and-a- half years in prison. Trial Rahman was held in HM Prison Belmarsh before his trial. On 4 May 2018, he appeared at the Old Bailey through videolink before Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, entering a not-guilty plea to terrorism charges. The trial began on 18 June 2018 and lasted less than one day. The defending lawyer argued that Rahman had been \\"brainwashed\\" by his uncle and that he had never intended to go through with the \\"fantasy\\" assassination. However, a probation report read by the judge revealed that Rahman had admitted he would have carried out the attack if he had been able to. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told him he \\"would have plenty time to study the Koran in prison\\" and that \\"Islam is a religion of peace\\", similar to what he said at the trial of the Parsons Green tube bomber. During the trial, Rahman pleaded guilty to the separate charge of \\"engaging in conduct which assisted the preparation of terrorist acts\\", relating to the sponsorship video he filmed for Mohammad Aqib Imran. In August 2018, Rahman was given a life sentence for conspiracy to commit terrorism, with a minimum term of 30 years. He was also given a 6 year sentence for creating the sponsorship video, with the terms being served concurrently.

Since the late 1970s she has worked to improve access to education on Six Nations of the Grand River, the most-populous First Nations reserve in Canada. Jamieson helped to found Six Nations Polytechnic (SNP), an indigenous educational institution, and has been its president and CEO since 2009. For her work in advancing indigenous education, preserving culture and fostering reconciliation, Jamieson has been recognized with two honorary doctorates and membership in the Order of Ontario and the Order of Canada. Early life and education Rebecca Jamieson was born in Michigan, in the Eel Clan of the Tuscarora people. When she was 2 years old, her family moved to Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario, the most-populous First Nations reserve in Canada. During the time of the Canadian Indian residential school system, which sought to assimilate aboriginal children, Jamieson found that her people were not represented in the school lessons. This sent a message to her that the reality she was being taught mattered more than her life at home. Jamieson felt the legacy of the residential schools, particularly Mohawk Institute Residential School, had caused lasting cultural divisions and that it was necessary for Six Nations to \\"reclaim education\\" as part of their recovery. Jamieson received a Native Social Counsellor Certificate from the University of Toronto, and an Ontario Teacher Certificate from the Ontario Teacher Education College, Hamilton. She received a BA in psychology and philosophy from Wilfrid Laurier University, and Master of Education from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education in 1978. Career Jamieson began her career as a post- secondary student counsellor with Six Nations. She then worked as a teacher, a consultant, and director of student services with the Grand River Education Office. She helped found Grand River Polytechnic Institute (now Six Nations Polytechnic, SNP) in 1993. It has since grown into a leading indigenous institute in Ontario. In 2009 she became SNP's president and CEO. Jamieson built partnerships between SNP and dozens of other aboriginal institutes, colleges and universities. These partnerships saw university courses taught at Six Nations, with diplomas and degrees offered through partner institutions. In 2017, SNP became the first indigenous institution to confer its own accredited degree which was also the world's first degree program for an indigenous language. When the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released its findings and recommendations in 2015, Jamieson and SNP already had decades of experience in line with its \\"calls to action\\". However, she cautioned against making indigenous learning compulsory, noting, \\"You can't indigenize something that isn't Indigenous\\". She has preferred to instead work through mutual understanding and respect. Jamieson has been increasingly sought-after for her expertise. She served as the executive director of the College Standards and Accreditation Council (CSAC), and on the board of governors for several universities in Ontario. In 2017, Jamieson and SNP hosted the World Indigenous Peoples Conference on Indigenous Education (WIPCE) with 3,000 attendees.
