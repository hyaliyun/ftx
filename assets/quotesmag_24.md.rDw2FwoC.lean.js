For example, birth certificates, recognised details certificates, and driver licences are regulated by the states and territories, while Medicare and passports are matters for the Commonwealth. Changing legal gender assignment for federal purposes such as Medicare and passports requires only a letter from a treating medical practitioner. By contrast, most states and territories impose additional requirements for gender recognition that have been criticised by the Australian Human Rights Commission and LGBT advocates. This includes requiring the person to undergo sexual reassignment surgery and, in most jurisdictions until 2018, to divorce if married. Advocates argue that marital status and surgery requirements are irrelevant to the recognition of a person's sex or gender identity, and instead should rely on their self-identification. The legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2017 had the effect of removing the requirement to divorce if one was already married. This took effect on 9 December 2018 unless the state or territory government has already removed this requirement beforehand. Gender reassignment surgery is available in Australia with the costs of some, but not all, treatments for transgender people covered by the national Medicare public health scheme. Between 2004 and 2017 transgender children required approval from the Family Court of Australia before being prescribed hormone treatment, although a series of rulings in 2013 and 2017 removed the need for court approval of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone therapy where there is no dispute between a child, their parents and their treating doctors. History Following the widespread newspaper reports of the successful sex change operations of Christine Jorgensen in December 1952 and Roberta Cowell in March 1954, the first reported case of an Australian undertaking a sex change operation was an ex- RAAF Staff Sergeant Robert James Brooks in February 1956.Ex-RAAF man wants to change his sex, Mirror (Perth, WA), Saturday 25 February 1956, Page 5 In 1975, the Gender Dysphoria Clinic at Queen Victoria Hospital Melbourne was established by Dr Trudy Kennedy and Dr Herbert Bower. The clinic later moved in the Monash Medical Centre in 1989 and closed surgeries in 2009; however, it continues to provide mental health assessments and referrals as the Monash Health Gender Clinic. In 1979 Australia's first transgender rights and advocacy organisations were established, the Melbourne-based Victorian Transsexual Coalition and the Victorian Transsexual Association; these were followed in 1981 by the Sydney-based Australian Transsexual Association, which included prominent activist, academic and author Roberta Perkins. In 1987, Estelle Asmodelle became possibly Australia's first legally recognized post operative transgender person with the Births, Deaths and Marriages Department of New South Wales,The Daily Mirror (Australia) Newspaper 13 October 1987 and her transition helped gain recognition for transgender people in Australia.Highlands Post Newspaper 10 January 1986 This was the first time in Australian legal history that a transgender Australian was permitted to change their birth certificate to a different sex. Soon afterwards the passport laws also changed to allow the sex on passports to be changed Identification documents =Issues= Forced divorce Traditionally, all states and territories required a person to be single before changing the sex recorded on their birth certificate, which meant divorcing their spouse if the person was married. This was to prevent a same-sex marriage arising after the person's transition to the same sex as their spouse, contradicting the Commonwealth law prohibiting same-sex marriage in Australia before 2017. To prevent married transgender people challenging the \\"forced divorce\\" requirement on the basis that it discriminated against their marital status in breach of the Sex Discrimination Act, in 2011 the Gillard Government introduced an exemption in section 40(5) of that Act allowing a State or Territory \\"to refuse to make, issue or alter an official record of a person’s sex if a law of a State or Territory requires the refusal because the person is married\\". Despite the exemption, both Australian Capital Territory and South Australia changed birth certificate sex markers for married transgender people before the introduction of same-sex marriage, with the latter repealing its \\"forced divorce\\" law in 2016. Legislation abolishing forced transgender divorce in Tasmania was first introduced in 2014 but did not pass until 2019. In 2017 the United Nations Human Rights Committee upheld a New South Wales woman's objection to her state's forced divorce law, finding it violated articles 17 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. New South Wales ended its forced divorce requirement in 2018. The section 40(5) exemption was repealed by the law legalising same-sex marriage in Australia, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017, making it unlawful discrimination for Australian states and territories to require a transgender person to divorce before changing the sex on their birth certificate. However, the repeal did not take effect until 9 December 2018, giving states and territories 12 months to repeal any divorce requirement in their gender recognition laws. Medical requirements In 2014 the Australian Capital Territory abolished the sex reassignment surgery requirement for a change of sex on birth certificates, after a 2013 Law Reform Advisory Council report called it \\"inhumane\\". In 2014 trans man Paige Phoenix challenged the Victorian requirement for surgery on the basis that it would be potentially life- threatening, making a complaint to the Human Rights Commission and United Nations. South Australia abolished the surgery requirement in December 2016, while a similar proposal in Victoria failed in the Legislative Council by one vote. Western Australia formerly required sterilisation prior to approving a change in sex classification. This requirement was overturned when the High Court ruled, in the 2012 case of AB v Western Australia, that two transgender men who had undergone mastectomies and hormone treatment did not need to undergo sterilisation to obtain a WA gender recognition certificate. Non- binary gender recognition Norrie May-Welby is a Scottish-Australian who became the first transgender person in Australia to publicly pursue a legal status of neither a man nor a woman. That status was subject to appeals by the State of New South Wales.\\"Norrie May-Welby's battle to regain status as the world's first legally genderless person\\" , Daily Life Australia. 8 November 2013 In April 2014, the High Court of Australia unanimously ruled in a case titled NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie [2014] HCA 11NSW Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages v Norrie: Case summary [2014 HCASum 10] High Court (Australia).. that, having undergone sex affirmation surgery, androgynous person Norrie was to be registered as neither a man nor a woman with the NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. The decision follows previous regulations and legislation that recognises a third gender classification, and establishes that Australia's legal system recognises and permits the gender registration of 'non-specific', as the judges found in the Norrie case. The Australian Capital Territory's 2014 birth certificate law amendments also allowed people to register as male, female or \\"X\\" regardless of whether they had undertaken any surgery. Victoria's failed 2014 proposal had a similar approach. In April 2019, Tasmania amended the Birth, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act to allow the registration of genders on the basis of self-identification, with gender defined by the applicant through a statutory declaration. This allows a diversity of genders. Any gender-related description should be allowable, through the Registrar may refuse vexatious or obscene applications. The law within Tasmania goes into effect on 5 September 2019, after royal assent was granted on 8 May 2019 by the Governor of Tasmania.  Australian residents born overseas  Australian residents born overseas are eligible to record a change of gender with their state/territory's RBDM in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. After a change is recorded, they are issued a recognised details certificate (identity acknowledgment certificate in South Australia).https://publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/e061200f-7076-4c97-9b1c-8dad7f58258a/resource/1e272ba5-396a-4a19-a992-25697393fae2/download/bdmractreview- discussionpaper1includingmarriageequality.pdf =Protections by state= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Jurisdiction ! scope=\\"col\\"  Change of sex on birth certificates or recognised details certificates ! scope=\\"col\\"  Sex reassignment surgery optional? ! scope=\\"col\\"  Forced divorce abolished? ! scope=\\"col\\"  Non-binary gender recognised? ! scope=\\"col\\"  Anti- discrimination laws concerning gender identity - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Australian Capital Territory      - ! scope=\\"row\\"  New South Wales and Norfolk Island      - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Northern Territory  (birth certificates only, no recognised details certificates issued)     - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Queensland  (annotation on birth certificates only, no recognised details certificates issued)https://publications.qld.gov.au/dataset/e061200f-7076-4c97-9b1c-8dad7f58258a/resource/1e272ba5-396a-4a19-a992-25697393fae2/download/bdmractreview- discussionpaper1includingmarriageequality.pdf     - ! scope=\\"row\\"  South Australia      - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tasmania  (birth certificates only, no recognised details certificates issued)     - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Victoria      - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Western Australia   (Allows hormonal therapy as an alternative treatment for a legal gender change)    } Birth certificates and recognised details certificates are issued by states and territories. In many states, sterilisation is (or has been) required for transgender people to obtain recognition of their preferred gender in cardinal identification documents. Australian Capital Territory In 2014, the Australian Capital Territory passed legislation that removed the surgery requirement for changing the sex marker on birth certificates. In 2016 the ACT introduced a recognised details certificate for transgender people who were born outside the Territory to use as their proof of gender instead of a birth certificate. New South Wales The New South Wales Registry of Births Deaths & Marriages requires that transgender people must have \\"undergone a sex affirmation procedure\\". South Australia In December 2016, South Australia became the first state to remove the surgery requirement for a change of sex on birth certificates and identity acknowledgment certificates. Tasmania On 10 April 2019 the Tasmanian Parliament passed amendments to the Birth, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act. These amendment make Tasmania the first state to allow change of gender on Birth Certificates by a simple statutory declaration. There are a number of other landmark provisions. People 16 or over can apply independently. Parents can apply for change of the gender of children of any age. Gender can be self-described, and is not limited to certain categories. Parents can ask that birth certificates do not include a gender marker (at all: not a marker of \\"undetermined\\", \\"unstated\\", etc). Persons can ask that their own certificates do not include gender markers. This is in line with the Yogyakarta +10 recommendation 31, Royal assent was granted on 8 May 2019 by the Governor of Tasmania and went into effect after 120 days (i.e. from 5 September 2019). =Passports= The Australian Government Guidelines on the Recognition of Sex and Gender, which took effect from 1 July 2013, enable any adult to choose to identify as male, female or X. Documentary evidence must be provided from a doctor or psychologist, but no medical intervention is required. Alex MacFarlane was reported as receiving a passport with an 'X' sex descriptor in early 2003. MacFarlane achieved this after using an indeterminate birth certificate that was issued by the State of Victoria. Australian government policy between 2003 and 2011 was to issue passports with an 'X' marker only to people who could \\"present a birth certificate that notes their sex as indeterminate\\" In 2011, the Australian Passport Office introduced new guidelines for issuing of passports with a new gender, and broadened the availability of the X descriptor to all individuals with documented \\"indeterminate\\" sex.On Australian passports and \\"X\\" for sex , Organisation Intersex International (OII) Australia, 9 October 2011 The revised policy stated that \\"sex reassignment surgery is not a prerequisite to issue a passport in a new gender. Birth or citizenship certificates do not need to be amended.\\"  Gender dysphoria treatment  = Access by children = Medical treatment is available to a child who has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. A diagnosis requires that the child feels and verbalises a strong desire to have a different gender for at least six months. Medical treatment for minors with gender dysphoria experiencing puberty is generally divided into two stages: *Stage 1 treatment involves the use of puberty blockers, which are reversible and can be accessed by children who have reached stages 2 or 3 of pubertal development on the Tanner Scale – this may occur as early as 10 years old; *Stage 2 treatment involves administering transgender hormone therapy such as testosterone or oestrogen. This has irreversible effects (such as a deepened voice following female-to-male hormone replacement therapy or breast growth after male-to-female hormone replacement therapy). It is usually available once a person has reached 16 years of age. Transgender Australians are generally not eligible for sexual reassignment surgery until they turn 18 years old. A number of requirements must be satisfied in order for a transgender child to receive treatment. Stage 1 treatment in Australia is provided in accordance with the Endocrine Society's Clinical Practice Guideline \\"Endocrine Treatment of Transsexual Persons\\" and involves: *a standardised assessment of psychological development by two independent child and adolescent psychiatrists *a formal assessment of the child’s gender identification and capacity to understand the proposed treatment *an assessment by a paediatric endocrinologist to establish the child’s pubertal stage and exclude disorders of sex development *discussions between the paediatric endocrinologist, the child and their parents about the effects and risks of blocking puberty *(if there is any disagreement between the child, a parent or the medical practitioner about the treatment) legal authorisation from the Family Court of Australia Access to Stage 2 treatment requires the following: *consensus among a team of medical practitioners (a paediatrician, a fertility expert and two mental health professionals of whom at least one must be a psychiatrist) that the treatment is in the best interests of the child *(if there is any disagreement between the child, a parent or the medical practitioner about the treatment) legal authorisation from the Family Court of Australia  Court involvement  In the 2004 case Re Alex : Hormonal Treatment for Gender Identity Dysphoria the Family Court of Australia held that both Stage 1 and Stage 2 treatments for gender dysphoria were non- therapeutic \\"special medical procedures\\" for the purposes of the Family Law Act 1975, which meant that even if a child's parents consented, the Family Court's approval was necessary to ensure the child's welfare was protected. This was based on the principles of Marion's Case, in which the High Court of Australia ruled that parental consent was insufficient for \\"special medical procedures\\", and instead court approval was necessary to ensure they were in the best interests of the child. After that case, the Family Court heard an increasing number of applications for child gender dysphoria treatment. In its judgments, the Family Court assessed the child's Gillick competence; in other words, whether the child was in a position to consent to the treatment by fully understanding its nature, effects and risks. If the Court found the child to be Gillick-competent, the child's wishes had to be respected. If not, the Court would then decide whether the proposed treatment was in the child's best interests. The need for court involvement was relaxed in several 2013 judgments, which were approved by the Full Court of the Family Court in Re Jamie. In these cases, the judges accepted that the medical treatments were therapeutic in nature and that parents could consent to Stage 1 treatment for their child without court oversight. Following these cases, court approval for Stage 1 treatment is only necessary if there was a disagreement between the child, their parents or their treating doctors about the treatment. Australia was the only country in the world to require court involvement in the process. Several families with transgender children called for the Family Court's role to be abolished in all non-disputed cases, given that the legal process merely \\"rubber stamped\\" the expert opinions of medical practitioners and imposed significant financial and emotional costs on applicants. The legal process cost about $30,000 in 2016. Opponents of court involvement also indicated that some transgender teenagers were risking their lives sourcing cross-sex hormones on the black market due to the cost and delays caused by the legal process. In 2016, Family Court Chief Justice Diana Bryant acknowledged the difficulties of the existing process and promised it would be simplified. Bryant had earlier suggested in 2014 that the High Court of Australia should reconsider the case law requiring court supervision for the medical treatment of transgender children. In late 2016 a spokesperson for Attorney-General George Brandis said the government was “actively considering options” for reform. On 30 November 2017, the Full Court of the Family Court issued a ruling which removed the requirement for court approval of Stage 2 where the child, the family and medical staff all agreed. The case, known as Re Kelvin, was brought by a father of a 16-year old transgender child, who asked the court to consider whether previous case law requiring the court process for unopposed applications should be overturned. The case had several interveners, most of whom agreed that the court should be only be involved in the process if there was a disagreement. = Access by adults = Gender reassignment surgery is available in Australia, but only at a few private hospitals at a relatively high cost. The costs of some, but not all treatments for trans people are covered by the national Medicare public health scheme. Trans advocates have campaigned for full Medicare funding for various treatments that may be unaffordable for transgender people, such as top surgery, facial surgery and hormone therapy, among others. Some Australian medical staff lack expertise in trans issues, particularly in rural areas, and many transgender Australians travel overseas for surgery to countries such as Thailand. Australia's compulsory superannuation scheme for retirement savings can be accessed early to cover the cost of surgery locally and overseas. Members of the transgender community have also called for greater access to mental health services given the increased demand. Private psychologists and psychiatrists can be expensive, with delays of 12 to 18 months recorded in Victoria for access via the public system. A few doctors require psychological or psychiatric evaluation before prescribing hormone therapy, but the informed consent approach has made the process easier in recent years.  Discrimination protections  =Federal law protections= Prior to 1 August 2013 Australia did not comprehensively outlaw discrimination based on gender identity at the federal level. In late 2010, the Gillard Labor Government announced a review of federal anti-discrimination laws, with the aim of introducing a single equality law that would also cover sexual orientation and gender identity.Red Book plan a step towards gay marriage , The Australian, 15 December 2010 This approach was abandoned and instead on 25 June 2013, the Federal Parliament added marital or relationship status, sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status as protected attributes to the existing Sex Discrimination Act by passing the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act 2013. From 1 August 2013, discrimination against transgender and gender diverse people, and all LGBTI people, became illegal for the first time under national law. Aged care providers who are owned by religious groups will no longer be able to exclude people from aged care services based on their LGBTI or same-sex relationship status. However, religious owned private schools and religious owned hospitals are exempt from gender identity and sexual orientation provisionsAustralian Parliament, Explanatory Memorandum to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Bill 2013 , 2013 in the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Bill 2013.Australia outlaws LGBT discrimination under national laws for first time , 25 June 2013 =State and territory law protections= Aside from Commonwealth (i.e. federal) anti-discrimination laws, each of the states and territories have their own laws which protect LGBTI people from discrimination. =School anti-bullying programs= The Safe Schools Coalition Australia has sought to combat anti-LGBTI abuse or bullying, which research suggested was prevalent across Australian schools. Initially established in Victorian schools in 2010, the program was launched nationwide in 2014 under the Abbott Government. The program received support from a majority of state governments, LGBTI support groups and other religious and non-governmental organisations such as beyondblue, headspace and the Australian Secondary Principals Association. However, the program faced criticism in 2015 and 2016 from social conservatives including the Australian Christian Lobby, LNP politicians such as Cory Bernardi, George Christensen, Eric Abetz, Malcolm Turnbull, Tony Abbott, Kevin Andrews, and former Labor Senator Joe Bullock for indoctrinating children with \\"Marxist cultural relativism\\" and age- inappropriate sexuality and gender concepts in schools, while others criticised the Marxist political views of Roz Ward, a key figure in the program. Petitions were also delivered against the program by members of Australia's Chinese and Indian communities. The concerns led to a review under the Turnbull Government, which implemented a number of changes such as restricting the program to high schools, removing role playing activities and requiring parental consent before students take part. The federal changes were rejected by the governments of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, who persisted with the original program and announced they would fund it independently of the federal government. Funding for the federal program has since been allowed to lapse. Marriage In the 2001 case of Re Kevin – validity of marriage of transsexual, the Family Court of Australia held that a post-operative transsexual person could be recognised as their new gender for the purposes of marriage.

History The SSA emerged from the 1980 meeting of the African Studies Association, where three panels were independently organized on Sudan. The SSA's co-founders, Richard Lobban (the organization's first President) and Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, gathered the names of scholars interested in forming an Association for the study of Sudan. Notable among those who showed early interest were Dr. Constance E. Berkley of Fordham University and Dr. Jay Spaulding of Kean College of New Jersey (now Kean University), who served as the first Editor and Co-editor, respectively, of SSA publications. Dr. Berkley served as the SSA's first Executive Secretary, and through her close ties with the Cultural Counsellor's office of the Embassy of Sudan in Washington introduced the Lobbans to Syd. Osman Hassan Ahmed, who had also compiled a list of Sudan scholars. Combining their lists, they sent out letters to roughly 70 people, informing them of the immanent formation of the Sudan Studies Association.

She protected the Hittite kingdom and was called the \\"Queen of all lands.\\" Her cult centre was the sacred city of Arinna. In addition to the Sun goddess of Arinna, the Hittites also worshipped the Sun goddess of the Earth and the Sun god of Heaven, while the Luwians originally worshipped the old Proto-Indo- European Sun god Tiwaz. It appears that in the northern cultural sphere of the early Hittites, there was no male solar deity.Maciej Popko: Zur luwischen Komponente in den Religionen Altanatoliens; AOF 34 (2007), 63–69 Distinguishing the various solar deities in the texts is difficult since most are simply written with the Sumerogram dUTU (Solar deity). As a result, the interpretation of the solar deities remains a subject of debate.  Family and myths  The Sun goddess of Arinna and the weather god Tarḫunna formed a pair and together they occupied the highest position in the Hittite state's pantheon. The pair's daughter is Mezulla, by whom they had the granddaughter Zintuḫi. Their other children were the Weather god of Nerik, the Weather god of Zippalanda, and the corn god Telipinu. The eagle served as her messenger. In myths, she plays a minor role. A Hattian mythic fragment records the construction of her house in . Another myth fragment refers to her apple tree:  Origin and development  The Sun goddess of Arinna was originally of Hattian origin and was worshipped by the Hattians at Eštan. One of her Hattian epithets was Wurunšemu (\\"Mother of the land\\"?).Jörg Klinger: Untersuchungen zu Rekonstruktion der hattischen Kultschicht. Studien zu den Boǧazköy-Texten, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1996, From the Hittite Old Kingdom, she was the chief goddess of the Hittite state. The \\"Gods' city\\" of Arinna was the site of the coronation of the first Hittite kings and one of the empire's three holy cities. The Hattian name of the goddess was transcribed by the Hittites as Ištanu and Urunzimu. They also invoked her as Arinitti (\\"The Arinnian\\"). The epithet \\"of Arinna\\" only appears during the Hittite Middle Kingdom, to distinguish the Sun goddess from the male Sun god of Heaven, who had been adopted by the Hittites from interaction with the Hurrians.Piotr Taracha: Religions of Second Millennium Anatolia. Wiesbaden 2009. . S. 89 During the Hittite New Kingdom, she was identified with the Hurrian-Syrian goddess Ḫepat and the Hittite Queen Puduḫepa mentions her in her prayers using both names:  Royal ideology From the Hittite Old Kingdom, the Sun goddess of Arinna legitimised the authority of the king, in conjunction with the weather god Tarḫunna. The land belonged to the two deities and they established the king, who would refer to the Sun goddess as \\"Mother\\".Maciej Popko: Arinna. Eine heilige Stadt der Hethiter; Studien zu den Boğazköy-Texten Bd. 50, Wiesbaden 2009. . p. 28 King Ḫattušili I would hold the Sun goddess in his lap.Volkert Haas: Geschichte der hethitischen Religion; Handbuch der Orientalistik, Abt. 1, Bd. 15; Brill 1994. . S. 585 Several queens dedicated cultic solar discs to the Sun goddess in the city of Taḫurpa. During the Hittite New Kingdom, the Sun goddess was said to watch over the king and his kingdom, with the king as her priest and the queen as her priestess. The Hittite king worshiped the Sun goddess with daily prayers at sun set. The Hittite texts preserve many prayers to the Sun goddess of Arinna: the oldest is from Arnuwanda I, while the best known is the prayer of Queen Puduḫepa, cited above.  Cult  The most important temple of the Sun goddess was in the city of Arinna; there was another on the citadel of Ḫattuša. The goddess was depicted as a solar disc. In the city of Tarḫurpa, several such discs were venerated, which had been donated by the Hittite queens. King Ulmi-Teššup of Tarḫuntašša donated a Sun disc of gold, silver and copper to the goddess each year, along with a bull and three sheep. She was also often depicted as a woman and statuettes of a sitting goddess with a halo may also be depictions of her.Maciej Popko: Arinna. Eine heilige Stadt der Hethiter; Studien zu den Boğazköy-Texten Bd. 50, Wiesbaden 2009. . pp. 30 The deer was sacred to the Sun goddess and Queen Puduḫepa promised to give her many deer in her prayers. Cultic vessels in the shape of a deer presumably were used for worship of the Sun goddess. It is also believed that the golden deer statuettes from the Early Bronze Age, which were found in the middle of the Kızılırmak River and belong to the Hattian cultural period, ere associated with the cult of the Sun goddess.  Ištanu  The name Ištanu is the Hittite form of the Hattian name Eštan and refers to the Sun goddess of Arinna.Maciej Popko: Arinna.

Built in 1914, it is a distinctive late example of Victorian architecture, set as part of a group of buildings typical of residential developments by the town's French Canadian immigrants. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The Cote Apartment House is located on St. Johnsbury's east side, in a small enclave of densely built residential buildings on the west side of Elm Street north of United States Route 2. It is the northernmost of a cluster of multiunit residences organized around a common courtyard, accessed by a lane now called Cote Court, but is visible from Elm Street across a patch of lawn. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a flat roof and clapboarded exterior. Its principal visual features are two-story porches, which extend along the front and most of the western side (which faces toward the courtyard. The porches have turned posts with brackets at the top, and square balusters. The main roof has an extended eave adorned with simple scroll-sawn brackets. The building houses three units, each of which retains original woodwork and other features. with The Elm Street area was already developed by 1875, but became progressively more densely built in the early 20th century, as single-family houses and their outbuildings were either converted into tenements or demolished to make way for them. This house was built in 1912 by Marcelle and Marie Cote, as one of three buildings constructed by members of the extended Cote family, who were French Canadian immigrants. The courtyard arrangement of these buildings was not an unusual arrangement for these immigrants, providing living space for large extended families, and is found elsewhere in the town. It was sold by the Cotes to the Giroux family in 1921. In 1985 it was acquired by a local housing group, which undertook its rehabilitation.

The land was previously the estates of two large houses, Dover House and Putney Park House, which were purchased by the London County Council soon after World War I. Dover House was demolished for the new estate, but Putney Park House remains. Context Roehampton emerged as a favoured residential suburb of the 18th and 19th centuries following the opening of Putney Bridge in 1729 and the development of a number of large private estates from which several of the original houses survive. Roehampton House (grade I) by Thomas Archer was built between 1710–12 and enlarged by Sir Edwin Lutyens in 1910. Parkstead House (grade I) built in 1750 for William Ponsonby, 2nd Earl of Bessborough, now forms part of the University of Roehampton. Mount Clare (grade I) built in 1772 for George Clive, cousin of Lord Clive, which forms part of the University of Roehampton, along with Grove House (grade II*), built originally for Sir Joshua Vanneck in 1777 (also now owned by the university). Capability Brown is reputed to have laid out the grounds. The university also owns Downshire House (grade II*); built in 1770 and once occupied by the Marquess of Downshire. Dramatic change came to Roehampton when the London County Council (LCC) built the Roehampton Estate in the 1920s and 1930s (renamed the Dover House Estate or the Dover House Road Estate). Later, in the 1950 the neighbouring Alton Estate was built. History In 1919, London County Council proposed an estate of about 1200 houses on the Putney House, and Dover House parkland, to fulfil a policy designed to relieve the pressure for 'Homes fit for heroes'. The Housing Act of 1919 incorporated generous subsidies for local authorities to build affordable housing for rent. The estate was meticulously planned with houses in short symmetrical terraces and pairs, with every house having a vista over green space. It was to be a self-contained community with a school and rows of shops. The layout where possible preserved prominent trees; the trees on the Pleasnace can be seen on 1787 Corris map. Building started from the Upper Richmond Road and progressed to the Crestway. The first houses were completed in late 1920, but a financial overrun delayed the completion until 1927. The roads and sewers were in place in October 1921; H. Woodham and Sons was the contractor. 1921\\\\. The housing was only let to families where the man had a permanent job which limited it further to whitecollar workers and a limited number of blue collar workers. The first tenants were civil servants, teachers and busdrivers. LCC did not allow tenants to make any changes to the outside of the property or even alter the design of the parlour. This continued until the 1950s. Council contractors would cut the front hedges each summer to maintain a uniform height and appearance. It was a model estate. In the 1970s, the Newnes path development was built over the northern allotments, and a sheltered housing scheme built over St Margaret's Parish Hall. Private ownership has damaged the integrity of the overall design, with hard standings replacing some gardens and renovations to the cladding and the windows breaking up the previous unity of the design, the area was made into a Conservation Area in 1978, to protect it by removing PD rights, and a management strategy put in place to encourage owners to reinstate original features. In the 1990s, the Vanneck Square development was built on the site of the former Huntingfield School. In 1991 Wandsworth Council was granted special powers by the then Department of the Environment to control virtually all alterations to the external appearance of houses on the Estate under an Article 4 Direction. Design The common characteristic of the LCC cottage estates is picturesque housing influenced by the Arts and Crafts style. =Layout= It was the intention at Dover House Estate to create housing in groups that overlooked or had access to open space, to provide a sense of intimacy and individuality, and the estate was laid out with communal green spaces. Allotments were also provided in three backland areas behind houses, two of which remain, the third subsequently infilled by housing. =Houses= The 'cottages' were designed in groups or terraces of between 2 and 18 dwellings. Each group was symmetrical so the group appears as one building. Each house was lit by gas, and the hotwater was provided by a boiler in the kitchen, a hand pump was used to raise the hot water to the bath room. There was considerable variety of design between different groups. The majority of the groups were built of London stock brick. Some had contrasting brick coursing and occasionally decorative patterns in diaperwork. Some of the groups at the northern end of the estate have a roughcast render that was painted cream. The roofing structures were used to give pattern to the groups. They were basically of two types: the conventional double-pitched roof, sometimes with gabled ends and sometimes with a hipped end, feature gables would be symmetrically introduced; then there were cottages with eaves at the first floor level that had dormer windows and a half-hipped end. A group on Huntingfield Road had a mansard roof. The eaves project prominently but with no visible facia boards and there are no barge boards on the gables. The roofs were tiles or slated, and groups use plain clay, interlocking Double- Roman(pantile), interlocking Courtrai pantile, interlocking terracotta (Marseille) or Delabole and Westmoreland slate. It is an aim of the Management Strategy to maintain these. The doors are of two principal sorts: a panelled door with six top panes, a panelled door with nine top panes. The windows have multiple small panes, larger glass not being readily available in that decade. The window were, depending on the group, either wooden casement, wooden rising sash or more commonly metal 'Crittall Windows'. Conservation area London County Council was very diligent in maintaining the appearance and integrity of the estate but as more and more properties passed into private hands the estate started to deteriorate, and the succeeding council did not have the powers to arrest the decline. The privet hedges were uprooted and replaced with a mish-mash of wooden, brick and metal fences and gates. Front gardens were lost to hardstandings for cars. The plain brickwork was rendered, pebble- dashed or stoneclad destroying the visual unity of the terrace. Windows have been replaced in an unsympathic way – the resulting UPVC not following the original small pane pattern, and even in some cases the opening was enlarged or the shape was changed. To protect this valuable LCC cottage estate, conservation area status was granted in 1978. Wandsworth council suggested and part-funded some ways to restore the estate. In 1991 the council was granted special powers by the then Department of the Environment to control virtually all alterations to the external appearance of houses on the Estate. These powers were granted under a provision of planning legislation known as an Article 4 Direction. =The Article 4 direction= The Article 4 direction means that the following changes need planning permission: *External alterations to houses which would be visible from the street; i.e. all front elevations and some side and rear elevations; this includes the replacement of windows and doors. *Changes to the roofs of houses; including re-roofing in a different material. *Laying out hard surfaced areas, e.g. for car parking within the front and some side garden areas of houses. *Building walls, fences or gates on front boundaries, which face a road or footpath. *Demolition of buildings and some front boundaries*. *Painting the outside walls of houses and flats, except the painting of rough- cast or render in one of the approved colours, light beige, cream or off - white.Wandsworth Council Article 4 directions References ;Footnotes ;Notes ;Bibliography External links * Roehampton Garden Society founded in 1922 Housing estates in the London Borough of Wandsworth Roehampton ","title":"Dover House Estate"},{"id":"52575286","text":"is a Japanese football player.J.League Data Site He plays for Fujieda MYFC.

Andrew de Rait was the younger brother of Gervase de Rait, Constable of Invernairn. Andrew was Constable of Nairn Castle in 1296. He appears on the 1296 Ragman Roll giving homage to King Edward I of England. He succeeded to his brother's estates and titles in 1297. Arms: Argent, a cross indented Gules Scottish Wars of Independence After Edward I sacked Berwick in March 1296 and the Scottish king John Balliol abdicated the following July, Edward held a parliament at Berwick on 28 August to receive the submission of the Scottish barons and clerics. Sir Andrew de Rait and his older brother, Gervaise, paid homage for Nairnshire. Sir Andrew supported Edward in 1297 when Sir Andrew Moray launched an assault against Urquhart Castle, then under English control. He apparently went north with those sent by Edward to put down Moray’s revolt under the leadership of Henry le Chen, Bishop of Aberdeen; John Comyn, Earl of Buchan; and Gartnait of Mar, son and heir of the Earl of Mar. Although Edward’s contingent met with Moray near the River Spey on 7 July, they did not seize him, blaming the difficulties of the terrain for preventing further pursuit. Andrew de Rait was selected to bear the bishop’s letter of explanation to King Edward: > In Launoy upon-the-Spey on the Tuesday before the feast of St. Mary > Magdalene, there met us Andrew de Murray with a large body of rogues, the > number of which Sir Andrew de Raite, your bachelor, can show you according > to what he heard from the people of their company. And the aforesaid rogues > betook themselves into a very great stronghold of bog and wood, where no > horseman could be of service. It would be too long a business to write, but > we pray you to have the goodness to give evidence to Sir Andrew de Raite, > your bachelor, who can tell you all these affairs in all points, for he was > in person at all these doings. Euphemia, Countess of Ross and Malise III, Earl of Strathearn, also entrusted Sir Andrew with dispatches to the king, the latter writing, “Dear Sire, I pray you, if it please you, to have the goodness to believe Sir Andrew de Raite, the bearer of this letter, in the matter which he will tell you verbally from me.” En route, Sir Andrew met with Hugh de Cressingham, treasurer of the English administration in Scotland, and showed him the bishop’s letter, but Cressingham reported to the king that the letter was “false in many points and obscure.” It has been argued that Cressingham believed that Chien, Comyn, and Mar were “exaggerating the value of the services they had rendered” in the hope that the king, in his gratitude, would reward them with “the estates of their rivals.” References 13th-century Scottish people 14th-century Scottish people Medieval Scottish knights Scottish people of the Wars of Scottish Independence ","title":"Andrew de Rait"},{"id":"52575370","text":"is a Japanese football player.J.League Data Site He played for Fujieda MYFC.

Since the 1960s, there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and others targeting the more prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the Cleveland Indians and the Washington Redskins. However, discourse surrounding mascot usage by elementary, middle, and high schools has been prominent, as these entities are subject to public legislation and community input. The greatest and most rapid change has occurred in the trend by school and college teams that have retired Native American names and mascots in recent decades. A database published in 2013 by the National Congress of Indians (NCAI) indicates that there are currently more than 2,000 secondary schools with mascots that reference Native American culture, compared to around 3,000 fifty years ago. Statewide laws or school board decisions mandating change have been passed in states with significant Native American population; other states also have official policies that encourage change in accordance with principles of establishing a proper environment for education. However, there has also been resistance and backlash, usually when statewide laws have been viewed as an intrusion into local communities, where no need for change has been established. The documents most often cited to justifying the trend for change are an advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Both support the views of Native American organizations and individuals that such mascots maintaining harmful stereotypes that are discriminatory and cause harm by distorting the past and preventing understanding of Native American/First Nations peoples in the present. Native mascots are also part of the larger issues of cultural appropriation and the violation of indigenous intellectual property rights, which includes all instances where non-natives use indigenous music, art, costumes, etc. in entertainment or other performances. It has been argued that harm to Native Americans occurs because the appropriation of Native culture by the majority society continues the systems of dominance and subordination that have been used to colonize, assimilate, and oppress indigenous groups. Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. Supporters also state that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than \\"political correctness\\", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Rex P. Shipp, the state representative for Cedar City, Utah, has introduced a joint resolution supporting \\"the appropriate use of names, images, and symbols of Native Americans and other indigenous people by schools or places\\" and discouraging \\"removing names, images, and symbols of Native Americans and other indigenous people from schools or places\\". While the resolution would not have the force of law, the chairman of the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation and the tribal chairperson of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah condemned the resolution. A similar resolution may be introduced in Idaho. Arizona A Native American legislator has proposed a bill that would ban the use of a sports team name or logo at a publicly funded stadium if any Arizona tribe found it to be disparaging. While primarily aimed at the Washington Redskins, the ban could effect other professional and amateur teams. California Upon introducing a bill to ban, as of January 2017, the Redskins name used by high schools in the state of California, Assemblyman Luis Alejo stated that there is \\"no reason why we can't ... phase out that particular derogatory term from our public high schools\\". The four affected high schools were Tulare Union High School, Gustine High School, Calaveras High School, and Chowchilla Union High School. Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law on October 11, 2015. While specifically targeting only the name \\"Redskins\\", the California Racial Mascot Act states \\"The use of racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames in California public schools is antithetical to the California school mission of providing an equal education to all.\\" In response, the Bakersfield City School District opened a discussion regarding the use of Native American imagery at two of its elementary schools. Both schools will continue using the name \\"Warriors\\" but will replace any Native American imagery with logos based upon their school's initials. Gustine High became the first to implement a change in February 2016; becoming the \\"Reds\\", the name used by the school from 1913 to 1936, but changed due to its association with communism. After a vote between four alternatives, Calaveras High School has selected to remove the Redskins name, but not replace it. The logo featuring a Native American will be retained. The Tulare school board began the process by surveying the public. The local Tule River Indian tribe was also consulted. The committee selected \\"The Tribe\\" as its top choice in April 2016. The school principal stated their intention to retain Native American imagery as much as possible. The Tulare Joint Union High School District board of trustees voted 3-2 for \\"Tribe\\" as the new mascot in June 2016. Chowchilla Union High School put off its decision until November 2016, after the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the school in October. The Chowchilla team name will be \\"Tribe\\", retaining their logo and Native American imagery. As of the January 2017 deadline, the four schools have complied with the letter of the law but not the spirit, retaining their Native American imagery and behavior, including a female student portraying an Indian Pricess in a floor length war bonnet and fans whopping and tomahawk chopping at games. With the agreement of the local government, Chowchilla has added \\"Redskins Way\\" signs to the streets leading to the school and insist they are maintaining a proud tradition that honors Native Americans, even as tribal members state that these practices trivialize and misrepresent the factual history of Native Americans in California. Calaveras, which has selected no official team name, is calling itself \\"the Mighty Reds\\" on its web site while retaining its prior logo. School alumni continue to use the name and wear their Redskins apparel at games, and cite the lack of Native American opposition to the name as justification. Such opposition exists, however. Joely Proudfit, chair of the American Indian Studies Department at California State University in San Marcos and member of the Luiseño/Payomkowishum tribe: \\"There's no redeeming quality of the word 'Redskin' but to try to soften the blow by using 'Tribe' or 'Indian' or 'Warrior' is nonsensical. It just shows that the proponents of keeping these types of words in there don't understand or refuse to understand the harmful effects of stereotyping one particular population.\\" Colorado In 2014 State lawmakers in Colorado began considering a bill that rather than a complete ban, would deny state funding to schools on a case by case basis, depending upon the name, logo, and local Native American support. Getting ahead of any potential law, Loveland High School in Loveland, Colorado, is \\"looking to a Lakota Sioux tribe for help creating a new mascot and a hands-on lesson in history and culture for the school.\\" Although passed by the House by one vote, the bill failed in a Colorado Senate committee. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has created by executive order a commission that will hold meetings where local community members, state agencies and Native Americans can seek to find common ground on the mascot issue. An example of local action is at Cheyenne Mountain High School, Colorado Springs, Colorado; which has taken action to eliminate stereotyping, including doing the tomahawk chop, or wearing warpaint and headdresses at games. Ernest House, executive director of the Colorado Commission on Indian Affairs, said the Supreme Court of the United States ruling which may restore the Washington Redskin trademark protection did not end the debate on whether Colorado schools should use mascots that evoke ethnic images. Florida The Hillsborough County School District, which includes Tampa, Florida, voted in May 2019 to examine all school mascots that use Native American names or logos. Five elementary and one middle school will select new mascots. Two high schools, George D. Chamberlain High School (Chiefs) and the East Bay High School (Indians) will keep their logos and names, but must stop doing chants and dances that invoke Native American rituals. However, after announcement of the decision, the response from some members of the public lead to meetings at which various opinions for and against change were expressed.  Connecticut  The Speaker of the House Joe Aresimowicz announced the consideration of legislation to ban all Native American nicknames and logos in Connecticut. Aresimowicz cited the October 2019 decision of the Killingly school board to change their \\"Redmen\\" mascot followed by the January 2020 reversion of that decision by newly elected Republican officials \\"a mockery of the process\\". A statewide ban would effect 19 high schools, including Killingly. Maine The Maine Education Department issued a notice in 2019 urging schools to refrain from using mascots and logos depicting Native Americans. After receiving statements in opposition to the \\"Indians\\" name from the Penobscot Nation and the ACLU of Maine, the school board voted in March 2019 to eliminate the mascot at Skowhegan Area High School. With the elimination of Native American imagery associated with the \\"Warriors\\" name at other high schools, Maine became the first state to eliminate indigenous mascots in all secondary schools. However, there continues to be local support for restoring the mascot in Skowhegan. Concurrent with local efforts, a bill to ban Native mascots statewide passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May, 2019. The community of Salem Township is supportive of the change of the Strong Elementary School \\"Indians\\", the principal stating that half the students were not aware of the mascot name. Massachusetts In 2017 a bill has been introduced in the legislature to amend the General Laws of the Commonwealth to add a section prohibiting the use of Native American mascots by public schools, which are defined as \\"A name, symbol, or image that depicts or refers to an American Indian tribe, individual, custom, or tradition that is used by a public school as a mascot, nickname, logo, letterhead, or team name\\". The team names \\"Redskins\\", \\"Savages,\\" \\"Indians,\\" \\"Indianettes,\\" \\"Chiefs,\\" \\"Chieftains,\\" \\"Braves,\\" or \\"Redmen\\" are specifically prohibited. Failing to emerge from committee last year, the bill has been reintroduced for the 2019-20 session Michigan The Michigan State Board of Education issued in 2003, and reaffirmed in 2010, a resolution that \\"supports and strongly recommends the elimination of American Indian mascots, nicknames, logos, fight songs, insignias, antics, and team descriptors by all Michigan schools.\\" In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a complaint with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserts that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to do harm, which was not established. One of the schools named in the MDCR complaint, Saranac Community Schools in Ionia County, Michigan plans to retain the name Redskins but has replaced the logo on its uniforms with a \\"Dreamcatcher\\" and the band will no longer play the \\"Tomahawk Song\\" at games. The cost of removing Native American imagery has been a barrier to change, but a new Michigan Native American Heritage Fund will receive money for such changes due an amendment to the Tribal-State Gaming Compact between the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi (NHBP) and the State of Michigan. In March, 2017 the State Superintendent requested an opinion from the Michigan Attorney General whether he had the authority to fine school districts that failed to remove Native American mascots and logos that advocates argue are degrading and culturally insensitive. The Attorney General responded in July, 2017 that the Superintendent did not have the authority to impose such fines. Schools that consider their use of Native American imagery to be respectful include Huron High School in New Boston (Chiefs), Woodhaven High School in Brownstown Township (Warriors), and Roosevelt High School in Wyandotte. While the Wyandotte mascot is \\"Bears\\", their marching band is the \\"Marching Chiefs\\" with a Native American logo. In 2017 a bill to ban the name Redskins was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Wayne Schmidt who represents a district which includes five tribal governments that support the ban. Also in 2017, Rep. Jewell Jones introduced a bill to ban all Native American mascots in Michigan. However, neither bill progressed beyond committee assignment. Nebraska The Legislature's State-Tribal Relations Committee is considering what action to take regarding Native American mascots in Nebraska, including a possible statewide requirement to eliminate them. Native tribes favor a requirement, while some legislators prefer allowing it to be a local decision. New York In 2001, the New York State Education Department (NYSED) sent a letter to all Presidents of Boards of Education and Superintendents of Public Schools in the state with the results of a study concluding that, while the use of Native American symbols is part of the deeply felt traditions in some communities, and many believe that mascots honor or pay tribute to Native Americans and their culture; most Native Americans appear to find the portrayal by others of their treasured cultural and religious symbols disparaging and disrespectful. Local schools should therefore proceed to eliminate Native American mascots as soon as practicable. While there were a few changes, the majority of schools in New York have retained their mascots. An exceptional case is the Salamanca Central High School \\"Warriors\\" in the city of Salamanca, New York. The city is within the boundaries of the Allegany Indian Reservation of the Seneca Nation of Indians, and 26% of the high school students are Native American. In response to the NYSED letter, the Seneca Nation Tribal Council joined with other members of the community in seeking to retain the Warrior imagery, although with individual differences of opinion. Salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community, with the Warrior identity combining elements negotiated between the Seneca and non-Seneca population. For example, the school logo now depicts a Seneca man, replacing the stereotypical Plains Indian warrior image that was used prior to 1978. Oregon On May 17, 2012, the Oregon State Board of Education voted 5–1 to adopt a rule prohibiting Oregon public schools from using Native American names, symbols, or images as school mascots; giving schools until July 1, 2017 to comply. Fifteen high schools using the nicknames Indians, Warriors, Braves and Chieftains were affected. However, Native American response was not unanimous; out of nine Federally recognized tribes in the state, two voiced opposition to the statewide ban on the basis of tribal sovereignty. Leaders said that there might have been an opportunity for developing an educational program for all students to learn about true native culture. In 2014 a state law was passed allowing schools to consult with nearby Native American tribes on acceptable names and imagery. While some Native Americans support such relationships with their local schools, Native American students who compete in athletics with these schools state that they are sometimes uncomfortable with the imagery used, and some groups maintain that the use of Native mascots needs to end everywhere. \\"These mascots undermine the educational experience of all students, particularly those with little or no contact with indigenous or native Alaskan peoples,\\" said Se-Ah-Dom Edmo, interim president of the Oregon Indian Education Association. In May 2015 the Board of Education unanimously voted down an amendment that would have allowed schools to retain their current names and mascots, maintaining the 2017 deadline for change. However, in January 2016 the board decided to grant exemptions to schools if they work out agreements with local tribes. Two schools have decided not to seek the approval of any tribe, citing the difficulty of doing so. The Fort Vannoy Elementary \\"Indians\\" (now the \\"Nobles\\") and Fleming Middle School \\"Rogues\\" (now the \\"Cavaliers\\"), both in the Three Rivers School District have changed their mascots. Rather than seek approval from any of the many tribes in the area, The Dalles High School decided to change from the \\"Eagle Indians\\" to become the Riverhawks in 2014. Warrenton High School now uses a generic sword and shield logo while retaining its Warriors name. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde entered into negotiations with four high schools on the conditions of removing some imagery and implementing a native history curriculum: Banks High School Mohawk High School, Molalla High School and Scappoose High School. However, after further consideration, Mohawk High School in Marcola, Oregon will drop its \\"Mohawk Indian\\" name because its imagery refers to an east coast tribe, the only connection being the local Mohawk Valley. In 2019, the school board is considering changing the name of the school and the school district in addition to removing a mural using Native American imagery. The Marcola school board has tentatively select \\"Mustangs\\" as the new mascot. The agreement with Banks High School includes replacement of the old logo featuring a Native American in profile with one using inverse Bs in the shape of an arrowhead, which was designed with assistance from Nike marketing and graphics employees. The Department of Education Government and Legal Affairs Manager recommended acceptance of the agreement at an initial hearing on February 23, 2017. It is estimated that removal of the old Braves logo from the building and uniforms will cost $95,000 over the next five years. The Oregon State Board of Education approved the Philomath School District's five- year agreement with the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians for the continued use of the high school's Warriors and the middle school's Braves. Also approved was an agreement with the Amity High School Warriors. The Siletz were one of the tribes that opposed the original 2012 ban, and wants the Siletz Valley Charter School in the town adjacent to the Siletz Reservation to remain the Warriors. Rogue River High School has eliminated their image of a Native American, using instead a spear. In exchange for retaining their Chieftains mascot, Rogue River will add a curriculum on true Native American history, and specifically, the Siletz tribal history. Roseburg High School would remain the Indians with the agreement of the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians. The Reedsport Community Charter School Braves sought tribal approval. However, three local tribes; the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw, the Coquille, and the Siletz do not agree that the \\"Reedsport Braves\\" is honorable way to represent their tribes. In an effort to retain part of their tradition, some in the community are thinking of changing to \\"Brave\\" and eliminating all Native American imagery. At a meeting of the residents and the school's Native American Name and Image Committee, one of the committee members asked how many preferred no change, with an overwhelming majority of those present agreeing. However, it was stated that was not an option. Schools with the Warrior team name may keep it by removing any Native American imagery: Lebanon High School and Oakridge High School. At Lebanon, only Native images deemed to be artwork not associated with the team will remain. However, the state has issued a notice of non-compliance to North Douglas High School, although the school superintendent has stated that all Native American references have been removed. South Dakota In January 2016 the South Dakota High School Activities Association passed a resolution asking all schools in the state to drop Native American nicknames and mascots. A bill was introduced in the South Dakota Legislature \\"to prohibit school districts from using school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames that are determined to be racially derogatory or discriminatory\\", but failed to pass by a vote of 22 to 46. A bill to ban discriminatory mascots was introduced in 2020, but failed in committee. Tennessee Opposing the trend for change, in response to the Tennessee Commission of Indian Affairs (TCIA) seeking a ban on certain race- based mascots in the state through the Tennessee Human Rights Commission, the 2007 Tennessee Legislature passed a law that: \\"state agencies may not require, prohibit, or impair the right of any public or private institution to continue to honor certain persons or cultures through the use of symbols, names, and mascots.\\" Public Chapter 371, 2007. One of the dissenting legislators characterized the law as protection for bullies who want to continue to insult and degrade Native Americans. The TCIA also opposed the law, stating in their testimony that it denies Native Americans equal protection under the law and the right to defend their sacred ceremonies and artifacts from misuse and caricature. Texas In December 2013 the Houston Independent School District by unanimous vote passed a preliminary plan to eliminate all ethnically sensitive names and mascots, one of which is the Lamar High School Redskins. The Washington Redskins issued a statement repeating its position that such names are not offensive to many Native Americans, but rather are a source of pride. In April 2014 the schools affected by the policy announced new names: the Lamar High School Redskins will become the Texans, both the Hamilton Middle School Indians and Westbury High School Rebels will be the Huskies and the Welch Middle School Warriors will be the Wolf Pack. The initial cost of the change was $50,000 for new fall uniforms, and there will be additional costs such as changing names and logos on facilities. The total cost is estimated to be $250,000. However it was noted that team uniforms are periodically replaced anyway, so the cost is not due only to the name changes. \\"The moral cost to our reputation as a diverse district -- where we care about the sensitivities of every single individual -- would be incalculable if we were not to do this,\\" HISD superintendent Terry Grier said.  Washington  On September 24, 1993 the Washington State Board of Education (WSBE) passed a resolution encouraging all state schools to end the use of Native American mascots This was reiterated by a similar resolution in 2012. In the absence of mandatory regulations, change has come only as individual schools have addressed the issue. Bellingham High School had a Native American mascot until it was closed for renovation. When it reopened in 2000, the mascot was changed to a bird of prey, but the name \\"Red Raiders\\" was retained. The Seattle-area Issaquah School District adopted a policy banning symbols based on racial stereotypes; resulting in a change of the Issaquah High School team from the \\"Indians\\" to the \\"Eagles\\" in 2003 over the protest of some students. The \\"Indian Head\\" logo used by the Clover Park High School \\"Warriors\\" has been replaced by a block \\"CP\\" with a spear. Wisconsin In 2010 a law was passed in Wisconsin to eliminate race-based nicknames, logos and mascots in schools; but allowing retention if they have the permission of local Native American tribes. Many mascots were changed either voluntarily or in response to complaints. However, in October 2013 the law was changed to make it more difficult by requiring the complainant to collect signatures of 10% of the school district's population and prove discrimination, while under the 2010 law only one petitioner is needed, and the burden of proof was on the school to disprove racism. Although now allowed to do so, some schools that have already made a change have decided not to restore their prior mascots. Native American groups opposed the change in the law. Delivering the State of the Tribes address to the Wisconsin legislature in March 2015; Mole Lake Sokaogon Chairman Chris McGeshik stated: \\"We believe the recent decision to override the progress made with the state in regard to the school mascots to be a mockery of the indigenous people in the state and around America.\\" In his 2019 State of the Tribes address, Oneida Nation Chairman Tehassi Hill proposed amending Wisconsin Education Act 31, which requires instruction on the history, culture and tribal sovereignty of the federally recognized tribes located in the State, to focus on the removal of Native American imagery in public facilities; stating \\"Teach respect, not racism\\". Prompted by the concerns of Native Americans, the Madison Metropolitan School District in Wisconsin has implemented a policy banning student clothing having \\"words, pictures, or caricatures based on negative stereotypes of a specific gender, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation or disability\\", which would ban all sports apparel displaying Native American mascot names, images or logos. However the ban may not pass the legal test that freedom of speech does not allow for a ban on expression unless there is a \\"substantial disruption of the educational mission\\". Visiting athletic teams will also be asked to leave behind Native American mascots and logos, otherwise the game could be canceled. A 2019 resolution to ban Native mascots statewide was addressed to the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. The resolution has the support of the Appleton Area School District, Madison Metropolitan School District, the Wausau School District and the Lacrosse School Board, with additional school boards scheduled to add their support.

He was one of the first to introduce the scholastic disciplines of history of art and architecture and urbanism to Turkey. He pioneered a unique \\"Turkish art\\" and pioneered the acceptance of the Turkish art concept.Celel Esad Arseven ve Turk Sanati Kavrami His 5-volume Art Encyclopedia is his most recognizable work.  Early life  Arseven was born in Istanbul in 1876, the son of Ahmed Esad Pasha (father) from the Grand vizier of Sultan Abdülaziz period and Fatma Suzidil (mother). His father died when he was young. His primary education started in Beşiktaş Taşmaktep. Beginning in 1888, he studied at Hamidiye Mektebi, Galatasaray Mekteb-i Sultânisi and Besiktas Military Rushdiyesi. In 1889, he entered the Faculty of Political Sciences and graduated while still studying in high school. In 1894, he graduated from the Military Academy as an infantry officer. During his studies, he took watercolor lessons from Hoca Ali Riza Beyden and Zonaro.  Career  In 1908, with his friend Selah Cimcoz, Arseven released a comic magazine called Kalem. In the same year, he was sent to Europe by the Ministry of War to expose the works of Turkish painters and to give concerts with the Mabeyn orchestra. In 1910 he wrote the play \\"Selim-i Salis\\" with Selah Cimcoz. The play, which received great interest, was published in 1958 as \\"Selim III\\" and was staged at the State Theater. In 1917 he wrote and directed Koruyan ölu and in 1918 he wrote Alemdar Mustafa Paşa (play). During World War I, he was at Kadıköy Municipality Branch Directorate, and then organized exhibition arrangements for artists in Europe. Also during World War I, while in Germany he and his friends founded a company called Transorient Film. In 1917, a contemporary adaptation of Goethe's Faust was filmed in Munich in the name of \\"Die Tote Wacht.\\" A renowned historian, researcher, and writer Ekrem Isin described Celal Esat Arseven as an inquisitive individual with adequate technical intelligence. “He was capable of expressing the collapse and transitional periods. Transition refers to the actual crisis when the masks of peoples’ faces drop and everything shows. Decadence is the period of teaching.\\" Arseven is the creator of said eras. The artist also served as administrator of Kadikoy District in Istanbul, Turkey. He was instrumental in rebuilding the place by taking away the asymmetrical construction between the port and marketplace. From 1921 to 1941, Arseven gave courses in architectural history and urbanism at the Fine Arts Academy. In addition to his duties at the Academy, he served at the Darülbedayi Directorate after 1923. He worked along with Hermann Jansen as an architectural consultant in Ankara between 1925 and 1927. He attended the First History Congress in 1932, and between 1933 and 1937 he served as Kadıköy Community House President. In 1942, he entered the National Assembly of Turkey as deputy for Istanbul. In 1946, he was elected as deputy for Giresun. On October 25, 1971, he received the National Award for Culture from Minister of Culture, Talat Halman.  Death  He died in Istanbul on November 13, 1971, at the age of 95, and was buried at Sahrayi Cedid cemetery in Erenköy.

He left his parental home at the age of 14, went to Dortmund and reportedly became a boilermaker. He went to sea and might have had contact with tattooists in the US. He got married in 1914 in Hamburg and opened a pub at Kieler Straße 44 (today Clemens-Schultz-Straße) around 1919. There was a separate area where he tattooed. His grandson and Theodor Vetter, a close friend of the family, worked as a business tout for Warlich.Marcel Feige: Das Tattoo- und Piercing Lexikon, Page 346–347. Research project Nachlass Warlich at Kaiserstadt Tattoo Expo Aachen, 2017 According to his own account Warlich tattooed „everything the male body should express […] politics, eroticism, athleticism, aesthetics, religion, in all colours, at every location.“ Though, in the context of a legal dispute about a face tattoo which was done by a competitor, Warlich claimed „a decent tattooer does not tattoo a face.“Schlange auf der Stirn Der Spiegel 10/1951 In over 40 years of working as a tattooist he had more than 50.000 customers, also Prince Axel and Prince Viggo from the Danish Royal family. Warlich died at work in his pub. After Warlich’s death Theodor Vetter (Tattoo Theo) took care of a part of the estate, the second part, including the famous flash book (Vorlagealbum) and photos, was sold to the Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte in 1965. So it was possible to show Warlich’s flash book in the exhibit „Wohin mit der Stadt“ in 2013. The Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte is planning to re-publish the Vorlagealbum, which was previously brought out by Stephan Oettermann. In 1981, he published the album with an accompanying text in cooperation with the museum. Although, over the next ten years, three editions of the volume were published, it is no longer available today. Oettermann’s publication was a groundbreaking and pioneering work. However, the low reproduction quality of the images do not entirely do justice to Warlich’s work. The quality of the original designs deviates strikingly from that of the reproductions. Therefore, a completely new and appropriate edition is planned.

He drew the original plans for the City of Adelaide and was later responsible for the design and execution of some of its significant buildings, including several churches in a Gothic style. History Thomas was the eldest son of newspaperman Robert Thomas, and was articled as a draftsman to George Strickland Kingston, who was appointed by the South Australian Company to accompany Colonel William Light to South Australia. Light's brief was to select and survey a site for the city of Adelaide, and survey it ready for sale to speculators and prospective residents. They were part of the \\"First Fleet of South Australia\\" of 1836: Light was on the Rapid, but Thomas was with Kingston, aboard Cygnet, which arrived in South Australia a month after Rapid, much to Light's annoyance. The sixteen-year-old Thomas was confusingly also listed as a passenger on the Rapid. His parents and brother Robert Kyffin Thomas were also in the \\"First Fleet\\" aboard , to set up the colony's first newspaper, the South Australian Register, and print the Government Gazette. It was Thomas, a \\"very clever penman\\" who drew the first map of Adelaide and North Adelaide. Light left the employ of the South Australian Company in 1838 and founded a private firm, Light, Finniss & Co., with Thomas as a partner, to act as purchasing agents and surveyors and to provide expert assistance to prospective landowners, and to Local Government bodies. The company was dissolved on the death of Light in October 1839. Thomas then worked as secretary for Kingston, who succeeded Light as Surveyor-General, at the same time working as architect on the original Adelaide Hospital. Although he had no formal training as an architect, he demonstrated considerable aptitude and gained experience in 1845 designing business premises, then in April 1846, he left with fellow architect W. P. James aboard the Cleveland for Britain, where the recent boom in railway construction had put a premium on experienced architects. James and Thomas had worked together on the design of a bridge, whose failure was blamed on their design, and the resulting controversy may have precipitated their departure. Thomas worked as surveyor and architect in Newport, Monmouthshire; he designed the Gothic entrance to the Cardiff Cemetery, and its Mortuary Chapels. He married Charlotte Tuckett in 1856, and they had several children while still in Britain. They returned to Adelaide aboard the Eizabeth Ann in June 1861, after a rather long passage of 101 days, towards the end of which Mrs. Thomas gave birth to a boy. During his absence from the colony he had qualified as Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and lost no time in establishing a practice on King William Street at the Gresham Street corner. Thomas's first big contract was for design and oversight of the new Flinders Street Baptist Church, where the first service was held in April 1863. He designed another Baptist chapel, completed the following year, in Alberton. His next major project was the Stow Memorial Church (now Pilgrim Uniting Church), where the first services were held in April 1867. Thomas was appointed Assistant Government Architect in June 1866 as deputy to the Government Engineer William Hanson. Shortly after, the department was reorganized and he was designated Government Architect at a salary of £600 per annum. The position was abolished in September 1870 and Thomas returned to private practice. His achievements during this time include the Supreme Court building, the Magill Orphanage, Mount Gambier Hospital, the Sailors' Home at Port Adelaide, and the Parkside Lunatic Asylum and oversaw construction of the General Post Office, designed by Wright, Woods & Hamilton.. Thomas was obliged, as a cost saving measure, to redesign the tower at a reduced height. He resumed private practice, but the only substantial buildings for which he was responsible in this period were St. Augustine's (Anglican) church in Unley, which he designed in 1864, and the Port Adelaide Institute on Commercial Road, Port Adelaide in 1875. Lack of finance meant the foundation stone for St. Augustine's was not laid until August 1869, and its supervising architect was the Hon. Thomas English MLC. Thomas served as Secretary to the Central Board of Health from 1874 and died at home in Unley after a protracted illness. Other interests He was a fine amateur artist, with watercolors his specialty. Recognition *He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institution of British Architects in December 1866.

It protects the headwaters of the Taquari River in an area in the transition between the cerrado and pantanal biomes. Location The Nascentes do Rio Taquari State Park is divided between the municipalities of Alcinópolis (82.7%) and Costa Rica (17.3%) in Mato Grosso do Sul. It has an area of . The buffer zone covers . The park contains parts of the Paraguay and Paraná river basins, and is near the watershed of the Araguaia River. It is between the chapadão and the pré-pantanal regions on the border between Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso and Goiás, and protects the sources of the Taquari River, considered the most degraded river in the pantanal basin of Mato Grosso do Sul. The park contains six large canyons formed over millions of years in the Chapadão de Baús on the western edge of the Brazilian central plateau. The park has archaeological sites that date back 11,000 years, with traces in caves of ancient rock paintings and petroglyphs. The park has great scenic beauty, and high potential for ecotourism, environmental education and research. The management plan, published in June 2009, defined zones of usage for the park. About 50% is defined as having minimal human intervention, with restricted visitation. The Nascentes do Rio Taquari State Park is in the Pantanal Biosphere Reserve, which also includes the Pantanal, Chapada dos Guimarães, Emas and Serra da Bodoquena national parks, and the Serra de Santa Bárbara and Pantanal de Rio Negro state parks. It protects an important ecological corridor between the cerrado and the pantanal. Vegetation is in the cerrado biome, and includes seasonal forests and cerradão. Conflicting activities include plowing with intensive use of agrochemicals, mining, roads, transmission lines and homes in the park. History The Nascentes do Rio Taquari State Park was created by state decree 9.662 of 9 October 1999 with the objective of preserving the ecosystems, flora and fauna of the area, maintaining the watershed, cultural heritage and landscape, and supporting recreation and tourism in contact with nature. Implementation of the park was made as a compensatory measure by the railway company Ferrovia Norte-Brasil (FERRONORTE) for engaging in work that had an environmental impact in the state. Decree 9.663 of 9 October 1999 provided for expropriation of privately owned lands in the state park, with the expense of compensation to be born by FERRONORTE. Before the park was created all the land was privately owned. The process of acquiring the properties did not begin until 2007, with indemnification starting in March 2008. As of 2010 only 10% of the area of the park had been formally acquired by the state. The landowners were continuing activities such as cattle raising while negotiations over land value continued.

PFS is neurologically different from the other types of imagination, such as simple memory recall and dreaming. Unlike dreaming, which is spontaneous and not controlled by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), PFS is controlled by and completely dependent on the intact lateral prefrontal cortex. Unlike simple memory recall that involves activation of a single neuronal ensemble (NE) encoded at some point in the past, PFS involves active combination of two or more object-encoding neuronal ensembles (objectNE). The mechanism of PFS is hypothesized to involve synchronization of several independent objectNEs. When objectNEs fire out-of- sync, the objects are perceived one at a time. However, once those objectNEs are time-shifted by the lateral PFC to fire in-phase with each other, they are consciously experienced as one unified object or scene. History of the term The earliest reference to mental synthesis is found in the doctoral dissertation of SJ Rowton written in 1864. Paraphrasing Cicero’s description of nature that can only be unified in someone’s mind, SJ Rowton writes: “... there cannot be one thing unless by a mental synthesis of many things or parts ...” In the 20th century the term mental synthesis was often used in psychology to describe the experiments of combinatorial nature. In a common experimental setup, subjects are instructed to mentally assemble the verbally described shapes in various ways. For example, the shapes may have been the capital letters ‘J’ and ‘D’, and the subject would then be asked to combine them into as many objects as possible, with size being flexible. A suitable answer in this example would be: an umbrella. The performance in this task is then quantified by counting the number of legitimate patterns that participants construct using the presented shapes. As the neurobiological study of imagination advanced in the 21st century, there was a need to distinguish the neurologically distinct components of imagination: first in terms of their dependence on the lateral PFC and second in terms of the number of involved neuronal ensembles. As a result, “mental synthesis” was adapted to describe the active process of assembling two or more independent objectNEs from memory into novel combinations. The term \\"prefrontal synthesis\\" was later proposed for use in place of \\"mental synthesis\\" in order to emphasize the role of the PFC and further distance this type of active imagination from other types of spontaneous imagination, such as REM-sleep dreaming, day-time dreaming, hallucination, and spontaneous insight. There is evidence that a deficit in PFS in humans presents as language which is \\"impoverished and show[s] an apparent diminution of the capacity to 'prepositionize'. The length and complexity of sentences are reduced. There is a dearth of dependent clauses and, more generally, an underutilization of what Chomsky characterizes as the potential for recursiveness of language\\" Neuroscience of prefrontal synthesis The mechanism of PFS is hypothesized to involve synchronization of several independent object-encoding neuronal ensembles (objectNEs). When objectNEs fire out-of-sync, the objects are perceived one at a time. However, once those objectNEs are time-shifted by the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) to fire in-phase with each other, they are consciously experienced as one unified object or scene. The synchronization hypothesis has never been directly tested but is indirectly supported by several lines of experimental evidence. Furthermore, it is the most parsimonious way to explain the formation of new imaginary memories since the same mechanism of Hebbian learning (“neurons that fire together wire together”) that is responsible for externally-driven sensory memories of objects and scenes can be also responsible for memorizing internally-constructed novel images, such as plans and engineering designs. In the process of formation of novel receptive memories, neurons are synchronized by simultaneous external stimulation (e.g., light reflected from a moving object is falling on the retina at the same time). In the process of formation of novel imaginary memories, neurons are synchronized by the LPFC during waking or spontaneously during dreaming. In both cases it is the synchronous firing of neurons that wires them together into new stable objectNEs that can later be consolidated into long-term memory.

Young lads under the age of eighteen with their own bikes were employed by local police forces with the primary role of taking messages during and after air raids if telephone communication was not practicable. The police during WW2 The police had a critical part to play as part of the civil defence arrangements during World War 2 for the UK. In addition to their normal duties they were responsible for enforcement of the blackout restrictions, monitoring enemy aliens, finding and arresting deserters, and dealing with drunken servicemen.British Civilian Life – Civil Defence and Home Guard – Wearcam.org They also attended all air raid incidents and depending on local civil defence arrangements would co-ordinate the response to a bombing. Most forces set up new sub-stations throughout their area.Memories of Thomas Renton Gordon – document deposited at South Tyneside Local History Library At the outbreak of War working in the Police was not regarded as a reserved occupation, although this changed in 1940, and many of the young constables joined up voluntarily or were conscripted; many constables were ex-servicemen who were called up as part of the forces reserve. The Police were also subject to a freeze on recruiting. They made up their numbers by recalling their own pensioner reservists, and by increasing the number of special constables (mainly men in reserved occupations). These were supplemented by War Reserve Police who were men over the age of conscription but who were not doing work that was considered essential for the war effort.Police Firearms Officers Association - the Wartime Years 1939-1945 Police Auxiliary Messenger Service =Establishment of the service= The Home Office had foreseen that communications would become difficult in the event of an air raid when it was likely that telephone communications would be cut either by wires coming down, by a power failure or where a telephone link could not be established. Civil Defence committees set up their own messenger services in 1939, in some cases pressing entire troops of Boy Scouts into service. This enthusiasm had to be tempered at the prospect of boys, and in some cases girls, of 14 out riding bikes with bombs flying around. A UK wide scheme was then set up in 1941 for volunteers over 18 – those under 18 were used post raid only.Put That Light Out – Britain’s civil defence services at War – (1939 – 1945) Mike Brown – Sutton Publishing Ltd. - 1999 The Police however needed their own messengers and from 1940 they took on lads below the age of 18, with their own bikes, (some forces recruited at the age of 15, others at 16). The PAMs, as they were universally called, were to act as messengers during and after raids. They were issued with uniforms – army surplus dyed black - and wore berets, or tin helmets during raids. They were employed full-time although it is thought that some Police Authorities also took on volunteer PAMs who only worked when the sirens went off.BBC The Peoples War – the Police Auxiliary Messenger Service – the PAMs =Training= PAMs were given a basic training in first aid and in the use of stirrup pumps. They had to know where all the civil defence and Police out-stations were – they would often be riding their bikes at night in the black out and would not always be able to see such street signs as there were; during or after an air raid streets could be blocked with rubble and debris.BBC The Peoples War – the Police Auxiliary Messenger Service – the PAMs =PAMs at work= From the firsthand account of those who served as PAMs it seems that in some areas where there was little enemy bombing, e.g. Oxfordshire, that PAMS were used as extra pairs of hands to make up for lack of manpower particularly in the headquarters offices.Fred’s Memories – Episodes in my life – Police duties – Fredsmemories.wordpress.com In areas targeted by the enemy the PAMs filled their primary role of taking messages during air raids but would also help the rescue services when needed. This was clearly the case in Coventry where PAMs proved their worth during the heavy bombing raids. George Frederick Barratt of the Coventry PAMs was awarded a British Empire Medal in June 1941 – his citation reads “Police Messenger Barratt, who was in the lower corridor of a building when it received a direct hit from a H.E. bomb, was blown by the blast for some distance. When he recovered he immediately made his way to report to the Main A.R.P. Control Centre and was sent out with a message. On the way he was blown off his cycle by blast. He remounted and continued his journey but ran into some broken telephone wires and sustained injuries to his neck. He delivered the message and returned with the reply. First aid treatment was obtained for him and although he was badly shaken again he went out through the rain of falling bombs to deliver other vital messages.”London Gazette -20 June 1941 p 3491 Another Coventry PAMs' citation for the B.E.M. reads: \\"Howard George Miles, Police Messenger, Police auxiliary Messenger Service, Coventry. During a severe enemy air attack Police Messenger Miles rendered great assistance by delivering urgent and important messages. He dealt with many incendiary bombs and, at grave risk to himself, helped to rescue a baby who was trapped in the wreckage of a house. Miles showed courage and devotion to duty.”London Gazette – 20 June 1941 p3493 Discontinuation of the service During War time, Police officers and their auxiliary support were not allowed to resign. In June 1945, in response to a question in the House Sir D Somervell, Secretary of State for the Home Department announced the discontinuation of this restriction on PAMs: \\"Yes, Sir. I am glad to say that the war-time restrictions on the liberty to resign of part-time special constables and part-time members of the Women's Auxiliary Police Corps and the police auxiliary messenger service will come to an end on the 1st July.\\"Hansard - HC Deb 14 June 1945 vol 411 cc1757-81757 This effectively resulted in the disbandment of the Police Auxiliary Messenger Service and its replacement with Police Cadets. PAMs in literature The Police Auxiliary Messenger Service is little known in literature but a recent book, Blitz PAMs, by John Orton,Blitz PAMs – John Orton – UKBookPublishing 2016 gives a semi-fictional account of the early years of the blitz on South Shields through the eyes of a 16 year old PAM. Although the story line (as told by Mossie Hamed, a grocery delivery boy of mixed Yemeni/Shields blood, which includes his ill-fated love for Jackie Hansen, a girl who pretends to be a lad to become a PAM) is fictional, the accounts of the air raids on South Shields are as near fact as possible, based on the photographic archive held by South Tyneside Local Library Service.SouthTyneside Historic Images – online PAMs archive material The Metropolitan Police Force's records of their Police Auxiliary Messenger Service is now deposited at The National Archives.

It was built in 2014, replacing a Parker through truss bridge built in 1931; the latter bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Setting The bridge is set just north of Jeffersonville, and carries Vermont Route 108 across the Lamoille River, providing access to Bakersfield via Vermont Route 108 and Waterville via Vermont Route 109. On the south side of the bridge it is connected to a rotary forming the junction of Vermont Route 108 and Vermont Route 15, which runs generally east-west parallel to the river. Historic bridge The 1931 Jeffersonville Bridge was a Parker through truss structure, with steel girder approaches at both ends. It rested on concrete abutment, and was long, carrying two lanes of traffic and a pedestrian walkway; the latter was cantilevered on the outside of one of the trusses. The total length of the bridge was about . It had a deck of concrete laid on steel I-beam stringers. The bridge was built in 1931 by the American Bridge Company, and was built using standards and practices adopted by the state after its devastating 1927 floods. Although the bridge rebuilding program after that flood formally ended in 1930, this bridge was built applying the same principles for selection of bridge type (based on the length of the span) and construction practices. with The bridge was replaced in 2014 by the present structure.

Background  Veteran James Barr appealed a Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) decision denying service connection for varicose veins. In October 1996, he filed a claim for service connection for varicose veins. He claimed at the time that the condition was due to physical training in service. He also provided lay testimony that he had been treated at a field hospital in service and that he received private treatment since separation from service in 1967. A January 1997 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with varicose veins and venous insufficiency of the legs. There was no medical opinion provided regarding etiology. The VA Regional Office denied the claim and the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement. In December 1997, the Veteran provided a statement that his condition started in 1966 but only started causing him pain 30 years after service. He also stated that in his unit there were medical professionals that looked at his condition but did not feel that surgical intervention was required. During a hearing he also reported seeing several private physicians that he had seen since discharge from service, to whom he had mentioned his varcosities. BVA denied the decision, finding that the preponderance of the evidence was against the claim. In its denial, BVA stated that there was no competent evidence to confirm that the varicose veins were due to service. The Board also stated that the Veteran was a layman and therefore was not competent to confirm a medical diagnosis or provide causation.  Analysis  The Court first acknowledged that generally a lay person is not competent to opine as to medical etiology or render medical opinions. The Court, however, pointed out that a lay person is competent to observe symptomatology and identify medical conditions in certain circumstances. In the present case, the Court held that the Veteran was able to identify varicose veins that are unnaturally distended or abnormally swollen and tortuous. The Court explained that because varicose veins may be diagnosed by their unique and readily identifiable features, determining the presence of varicose veins is not “medical in nature” and can be made through lay observation. Essentially, competency in this regard depends on the disability claimed.  Decision  The Court vacated and remanded the Board decision for further adjudication.

The park covers a hilly region to the north of the Amazon River. It is known for its caves and prehistoric rock paintings, among the oldest archaeological remains in the Amazon region. Efforts have been made to get the local people involved in supporting sustainable tourism. Location The Monte Alegre State Park is in the municipality of Monte Alegre, Pará. It has an area of . The park is entirely contained within the Paytuna Environmental Protection Area. The park covers an area of mountains and valleys that contains caves with rock paintings and archaeological sites relevant to scientific studies of the occupation of the Amazon and the origin of humans in the Americas. The sulphur-breasted parakeet (Aratinga maculata) is endemic to the region. History The park was the first conservation unit in Pará where the local community was involved in its creation. It was the outcome of studies by the Pará Institute of Economic, Social and Environmental Development (IDESP) at the end of the 1980s. The Monte Alegre State Park was created by law 6412 of 11 November 2001 with an area of . The objective was to preserve the natural ecosystems, reconciling full protection of natural resources, cultural, historical and scenic beauties with use for scientific, cultural, educational, recreational and ecotourism purposes. The members of the consultative council were named by ordinance 3717 of 29 December 2009. The management plan was approved by decree 3.553 of 22 November 2010. In November 2012 it was reported that researchers from the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi (MPEG) had recently found 19 sites in the lower part of the park with rock paintings and ceramic pieces. They were the work of ancient inhabitants of the region. Law 7692 of 3 January 2013 rectified the limits of the park, transferring to the Paytuna Environmental Protection Area. The park was now reduced to an area of . In April 2013 the Peabiru Institute said that five initiatives had been chosen to help local women and young people provide ecotourism services. The Monte Alegre Ecotourism Agents project would be supported by TAM Linhas Aéreas.

The paintings have been widely reproduced on the internet, in postcards and in tourist brochures. Most visitors only view the most accessible panel, with red and yellow figures that can be seen from the foot of the hill. The Gruta da Pedra Pintada (Painted Rock Cave) is deep, above sea level on the eastern flank of the Paytuna Range. It has several corridors and halls. This cave is in a region that was studied by the archaeologist Anna Curtenius Roosevelt and was widely publicized, so attracts the most tourists. The Pedra do Mirante is a rock that may be climbed to reach a panoramic 360 degree view of the area. The Painel do Pilão has cave paintings and a beautiful view of the region. The Gruta do Pilão is a cave with paintings that is one of the oldest archaeological sites in the Amazon. The Pedra do Pilão provides a lockout over the beautiful landscape. It has a few rock paintings of low visual impact. The Gruta Itatupaoca, or Gruta da Capela, is deep, about above the Amazon River in the south slope of the Ererê Range. The entrance is about high, divided in the lower half by a rocky column. The Gruta do Miritiepé is deep, above the Amazon on the northwest flank of the Paytuna Range.

Bounded by Main, Pine, College, and St. Paul Streets just west of City Hall Park, the architecture on this one city block represents nearly a century's worth of development. It is dominated by the former plant of the Wells-Richardson Company, a highly successful maker of patent medicines in the late 19th century. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The city block just west of City Hall Park in Burlington has long been seen as a desirable commercial area. It is located at the former northern terminus of a stagecoach route (now United States Route 7), and is near to the civic center of the city and of Chittenden County, located across St. Paul Street to the south of the park. The oldest surviving building in the block is a brick building at the northern end of the St. Paul Street block, built in the 1820s as a three-story building and renovated and enlarged in 1870 and 1910, when it was part of the Burlington Steam Laundry. Other buildings facing the park across St. Paul Street were built as hotels between 1872 and 1910, and exhibit Colonial Revival and Commercial Italianate style. with The dominant elements of the rest of the city block include five buildings historically associated with the Wells-Richardson Company. Under the direction of General William Wells, this company was highly successful in selling Paine's Celery Compound, a patent medicine which it marketed as far away as Sydney, Australia. The company survived on other products for thirty years after federal legislation in 1906 effectively ended the distribution of patent medicines. Its main manufacturing plant was the brick four-story building occupying the center of the block, and the company also occupied 125 College Street, where it had a retail space, showrooms, and offices. It eventually expanded into other buildings on the block, occupying five in all at its economic height.

It was cited by Vasari in his biography of Sarto, who would die of the plague the next year. However, in 1580, the painting was sold by monsignor Antonio Bracci to Jacopo Salviati, and it became part of the collections of the Colonna and later Barberini, until it was purchased by the Italian State in 1935.

The Irish Defence Forces are small and recruitment is entirely voluntary. Irish neutrality means they have never fought in a war, though they have participated in United Nations peacekeeping missions. History Impressment of Irish sailors into the English and British Navy was practised in the 17th and 18th centuries. It occurred in Cromwell's Commonwealth and under Charles II; after the Williamite War it stopped, but recurred in later wars. The ranks of the Irish Militia, formed in 1793 for defence during the Napoleonic Wars, were supposed to be filled by local \\"ballots\\" (lotteries), but widespread violent opposition prompted an amendment to allow \\"fines\\", levied by parish and used to pay volunteer replacements.; The Irish Volunteers founded in 1913 took the name of the 18th-century Irish Volunteers; both militias saw the free choice of their members to participate as a source of pride. The term \\"volunteer\\" is used as a title for members by physical force Irish republican paramilitary groups descended from or inspired by the Irish Volunteers, like the Irish Republican Army. The Conscription Crisis of 1918 arose when Lloyd George's UK government attempted to extend to Ireland the conscription which was already in place in Great Britain because of the First World War. The Mansion House Conference to oppose conscription was organised by Irish nationalists, including Sinn Féin, the Irish Parliamentary Party and the Catholic hierarchy. Sinn Féin's perceived leading role helped it to win most Irish seats in the 1918 general election. During the Second World War, the Irish state remained neutral and under a state of emergency. The Emergency Powers Act 1939 gave the government sweeping powers to bypass the Oireachtas (parliament) and the Constitution for the duration of \\"the Emergency\\". However, both military conscription and industrial conscription were excluded from the scope of the act by a section added at committee stage. In May 1941, there were reports that Churchill's UK government was considering extending to Northern Ireland the conscription which was already in place in Great Britain because of the Second World War. On 26 May, the 10th Dáil was recalled for a special sitting to protest. On 27 May, Winston Churchill told the House of Commons \\"it would be more trouble than it is worth\\" to introduce it. Contemporary debate Many supporters of Irish neutrality oppose the deepening of the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union. Supporters of EU integration have accused opponents of stirring rumours about conscription into a European army. Such claims were made regarding the Treaty of Lisbon by some fringe groups during the 2008 referendum campaign and believed by \\"48% of 'no' voters and remarkably 26% of 'yes' voters\\".

It is the first publication to mention (and illustrate) Santa's reindeer and sleigh, as well as being the first to describe his arrival on Christmas Eve. The accompanying illustrations are the earliest published artistic depictions of a Santa Claus figure. Publication The poem, with eight colored engraved illustrations, was published in New York by William B. Gilley in 1821 as a small paperback book entitled The Children's Friend: A New-Year's Present, to the Little Ones from Five to Twelve. The names of the author and the illustrator are not known. The illustrations were reproduced lithographically, the first instance of lithography in the United States. Published in the same city as Washington Irving's earlier portrait of Santa Claus in Knickerbocker's History of New York, the poem may have directly inspired another New Yorker, Clement Clarke Moore, to create the modern Santa in \\"'Twas the Night before Christmas\\". Development of the Santa Claus figure Gilley's book includes some important elements in the early development of Santa Claus: his connection with the northern winter, the reindeer and sleigh, and his arrival on Christmas Eve rather than on 6 December (the traditional feast day of Saint Nicholas). The accompanying engravings are the earliest images of a Santa figure. They show Santeclaus dressed in a red outfit and are the first reference to his being dressed in that color. Although red had been traditionally associated with bishop's robes, such as those that Saint Nicholas might have worn, the outfit shown is not that of a bishop, nor does it represent the old Dutch clothing of Saint Nicholas as described by Washington Irving and James Kirke Paulding. Santeclaus leaves presents as rewards only for \\"good\\" children. \\"Naughty\\" children receive a \\"long, black, birchen rod\\" whose use for parental punishment is endorsed as a \\"command of God\\". The poem Old SANTECLAUS with much delight His reindeer drives this frosty night, O’r chimney tops, and tracts of snow, To bring his yearly gifts to you. The steady friend of virtuous youth, The friend of duty, and of truth, Each Christmas eve he joys to come Where peace and love have made their home. Through many houses he has been, And various beds and stockings seen; Some, white as snow, and neatly mended, Others, that seemed for pigs intended. To some I gave a pretty doll, To some a peg-top, or a ball; No crackers, cannons, squibs, or rockets, To blow their eyes up, or their pockets. Where e’re I found good girls or boys, That hated quarrels, strife and noise, I left an apple, or a tart, Or wooden gun, or painted cart; No drums to stun their Mother’s ear, Nor swords to make their sisters fear; But pretty books to store their mind With knowledge of each various kind. But where I found the children naughty, In manners crude, in temper haughty, Thankless to parents, liars, swearers, Boxers, or cheats, or base tale-bearers, I left a long, black, birchen rod, Such as the dread command of GOD Directs a Parent’s hand to use When virtue’s path his sons refuse.

Following a year coaching high school, Collins became the linebacker coach for Fordham in 1996 before becoming the defensive coordinator at Albright College from 1997 through 1998. Collins would leave Albright to become a graduate assistant at Georgia Tech under George O'Leary for the 1999 and 2000 seasons. Following two years in the GA position, Collins was promoted to tight ends coach at Georgia Tech for the 2001 season. Collins would return to his alma mater to become Western Carolina's defensive coordinator from 2002 through 2005 before returning to Georgia Tech in 2006 as the Director of Player Personnel. After a year at Alabama as the Director of Player Personnel, Collins would reunite with O'Leary at UCF as linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator from 2008 through 2009. =FIU (2010)= Collins served as the defensive coordinator for Florida International during the 2010 season.

During that time, Collins coached All-American Fletcher Cox, who was drafted in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft. Upon being promoted to defensive coordinator in 2013, Collins helped lead a Bulldogs team that finished in the Top 5 in the SEC in total defense, rushing defense and passing defense. In 2014, Collins' Mississippi State defense led the SEC in sacks and had the conference's No. 1 Red Zone defense en route to a 10-3 record. = Florida (2015–2016) = Collins spent two years as the defensive coordinator at Florida underneath Jim McElwain. While with the Gators, Collins oversaw a defense that ranked No. 6 in scoring defense in 2016 and No. 11 in 2015.

These hypogea have their chamber excavated into the rock, whereas the access or corridor was built with vertical stone slabs, which form a megalithic façade. These two tombs were excavated several years ago by an archaeological team sponsored by the Museum of Menorca.GÓMEZ, J.L. «Memoria de excavación del Monumento nº 2 de Biniai Nou (Campañas 1997-1998)». These tasks shed light into their chronology and let the team recover objects that formed part of the grave goods that accompanied the dead: ceramic vessels, awls, radiolarite fragments (a type of rock that was used to make tools). The tombs date from the Chalcolithic or Bronze Age. The importance of the Biniai Nou site lies on the fact that one of the human bones located in one of the hypogea was C14 dated and offered the oldest dating available in Menorca’s Prehistory (2290-2030 BC).  Hypogeum 1  Biniai Nou's Hypogeum 1 Monument 1 has a slightly concave façade with an entrance towards its centre. This entrance leads to a corridor which is covered by a doubled-slab system. The chamber has an oval layout and a stone bench to the left. There is a “capada de moro” or artificial depression cut through the rock 50 meters away from this hypogeum.  Hypogeum 2  Biniai Nou's hypogeum 2 Monument 2 also has a slightly concave façade with a central entrance which leads to a short corridor. The chamber is circular and is deteriorated due to a roof collapse, which was restored after the excavation process. Archaeological tasks determined that 81 individuals in primary burials were placed inside this hypogeum. When the roof collapsed the hypogeum was in full use.  Analysis  Even though Biniai Nou has offered the oldest evidence of human presence on the island (between 2300 and 2000 BC), it cannot be known for sure that this was the moment when the first settlers arrived, since they could have done so in earlier dates. Notwithstanding it seems that the first human beings who arrived to Menorca to stay on a permanent basis were already farmers and herders. These people carried animals inside their boats, which were bred on the island: goats, sheep, pigs and cows. The funerary traditions of these first communities included the construction of collective tombs of large slabs, which are known as dolmens or megalithic tombs. Some of them were completely built, such as the dolmen of Ses Roques Llises. Others, such as Biniai Nou, consisted in a chamber cut into the rock, whereas the entrance was built using the megalithic technique.

It was likely a companion piece to the Banquet of Absalom now hanging in the Museo di Capodimonte. The subject of this painting derives from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus found in the gospel of Luke 16: 19-31. The name Epulone has been attached in Italy to the rich man, but also generically refers to a feaster (with pejorative gluttonous suggestion). The etymology of the word comes from a banquet sometime prepared in honor of the gods. The painting depicts a rich man after completion of his meal, with empty plates, surrounded by servants, while in the background, is the beggar Lazarus.

After completing her studies at the University of Copenhagen in 1952, she opened a practice as an eye specialist in Hillerød.  Biography  Born as Liss Wognsen on 20 February 1924 in Copenhagen, the only child of a marine engineer and a seamstress. Raised on Amager, she matriculated from Christianshavns Gymnasium in 1943 and went on to study medicine at Copenhagen University. Her early work in connection with the Dansk Samling party prepared her for involvement in the resistance movement from August 1943 when the Danish government ceased cooperating with the Germans. Initially, she distributed illegal newspapers and books, kept guard at sabotage sites and tracked suspected informers. As time went by, she was trained to shoot and take care of weapons and ammunition. In February 1945, her colleagues in the Holger Danske group were arrested at a watchmaker's shop where they regularly met. Mellemgaard was not among them as she had stayed at home with laryngitis. They were taken to police headquarters, beaten and imprisoned. Most of them were executed three weeks later. After the war, she completed her medical studies in 1952 and married a doctor the following year. Together they had three children. She had her own practice as an eye specialist in Hillerød from 1952 to 1970. For many years she did not discuss her involvement in the resistance but in 1998 she wrote an autobiography: Pige i modstandskampen (Girl in the Resistance).

At once he finds himself with a different past, a different wife, and a different fate. *\\"Golden Bell, Seven, and the Marquis of Zeng\\" (from Black Gate, v. 1, no. 1, Spr. 2000) - Seven, a young man of Zeng, falls in love from afar with Jia Jin, a concubine intended for sacrifice when the ruling Marquis dies.

This practice is also known as Dispersed Water Management by the South Florida Water Management District, and as Water Farcing by critics. History In 2005, the South Florida Water Management District created a new program for water farming called the \\"Dispersed Water Management Program\\" with eight farmers. The program uses shallow-water storage on existing lands to hold water. Lobbying In 2014, Alico dispatched lobbyists to the Florida legislature to try to get funding for the project. When asked about this effort, Alico spokeswoman Sarah Bascom is reported to have said that Alico was just helping a state agency in need by lobbying for the SFWMD who was not permitted by law to lobby. Prior to this effort, funding was provided by the South Florida Water Management District. Though $31.8 million was appropriated for the project in the 2015 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott vetoed the funding. The largest contract entered into by the South Florida Water Management District -- for 11 years and $122 million -- went to Alico, which would use approximately 35,192 acres of ranchland for water farming. The return on the investment for Florida taxpayers for $122 million invested is about a 1.5 inch reduction in the Lake Okeechobee water level. Controversy Much controversy surrounds the use of water farms due to their cost and hard to quantify benefit. A state audit found that the cost of a water farm on public land would be approximately $25 per million gallons, while the cost using privately owned land can be as high as $418 per million gallons. As such, the audit makes clear that the programs costs tens of millions of dollars more than it should. =Contract Termination= Another concern about the contracts by the South Florida Water Management District with the water farmers is the District is paying for capital improvements to the land owned by the water farmers, but the water farmers can terminate the contract at will. This could make the investment by the District a very poor one if the water farmers decide to plant as solutions to citrus greening emerge.

After the cricket team vacated the ground it was converted into a football stadium on the south side of Victoria Park (Hartlepool) which was the home of West Hartlepool R.F.C.. Greyhound racing A greyhound track was constructed around the ground in 1938. The first meeting was held on 14 September 1938 drawing an attendance of 4,000 and the first winner was a greyhound called Arran Beg. During the war the track suffered considerable bomb damage. Owned by the Hartlepool Greyhound Racing Company Ltd (HGRC) the track had a small 365 yards circumference and race distances of 266, 460 and 640 yards. There was a covered stand, a restaurant, 35 kennels and an 'Inside Sumner' hare system was used. There were seven on course bookmakers and the principal event was the Vaux Tankard. Facilities included a licensed bar and cafe. The racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body). Rugby union West Hartlepool played at the stadium from the 1920s until the 1970s.

Early life and education Walsh was born in Brooklyn, New York on October 14, 1875 to Michael Kavanagh Walsh and Catherine Farrell Walsh. He lived with his brothers Frank M. Walsh and Edward Maris Walsh, and sisters Lorna Walsh and Lydia Walsh, in the family's Brooklyn home. Walsh was educated at Columbia University, Georgetown, Notre Dame, and Marquette University, from which institutions he received degrees in law, philosophy, and literature. He graduated from Georgetown in 1892, during which year he wrote the class poem, \\"Columbus.\\" He also composed the Georgetown alumni ode \\"The Crusaders\\" in 1901, and read an ode for the dedication of the university's monument to John Carroll in 1912. Career as poet and translator Walsh was well known in Brooklyn for having composed an ode which he read at the formal unveiling of the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park on November 14, 1908. He was the occasion's poet laureate. During his lifetime, Walsh published four books of poetry: The Prison Ships and Other Poems (1909), The Pilgrim Kings: Greco, Goya and Other Poems of Spain (1915), Gardens Overseas and Other Poems (1918), and Don Folquet and Other Poems (1920). Walsh was an editor of the Catholic Encyclopedia and an anthology of translated Spanish poetry, the Hispanic Anthology (1920). According to John Bunker, \\"it is beyond question that his versions of many of the Spanish and Spanish-American poets introduced them to their first North American audience.\\" He also served as an editor of Commonweal magazine from its founding in 1924 until his death in 1928. In addition to editing, Walsh also wrote many short articles and reviews, including several for the New York Times. Death Walsh died suddenly of heart disease on the morning of October 29, 1928 on the steps of his home. A posthumous collection of his poems, Selected Poems of Thomas Walsh, was published in 1930. The volume \\"embodies about one-half of his entire poetic product\\" and includes a memoir of Walsh written by friend and fellow writer John Bunker and \\"appreciations\\" of Walsh by his friends Edward L. Keyes and Michael Williams. In his memoir, Bunker writes, \\"it is no exaggeration to say that he was one of the most noteworthy of our modern American ambassadors of culture.\\" Awards and honors Throughout his career, Walsh received many awards and honors for his work. He was given honorary memberships in the Royal Academy of Letters of Seville (\\"a distinction he shared with only one other American\\"), the Academy of Colombia, and the Hispanic Society of America. He also received the Grand Cross of Isabella Catolica, and the Honorary Medal of the Society of the Army of the Potomac.

Studies on the relationship between religion and disability vary widely, with some postulating the existence of ableism and others viewing religion as a primary medium through which to assist disabled people. Religious exhortation often prompts adherents to treat people with disabilities with deference, however when the disability constitutes a mental illness such an approach may be slanted with an acknowledgement of the latter's naivete.Bryant, M. Darrol. \\"Religion and disability: Some notes on religious attitudes and views.\\" Perspectives on Disability. 2nd ed. Palo Alto, CA: Health Markets Research (1993): 91-96. In religions with an eschatological belief in divine judgment, there are often traditions promulgating an exemption from judgement in the afterlife for the mentally disabled, as well as for children who die before reaching maturity due to both lacking an understanding of their actions in a manner analogous to the insanity defense. Regarding the rationale behind God's creation of disabled people, some religions maintain that their contrast with the able-bodied permits the able- bodied to reflect and God to subsequently assess the level of gratitude shown by each individual for their health. Buddhism =Buddhist religious texts= In the book, The Words of my Perfect Teacher by Patrul Rinpoche, the author states that the presence of a disability that impedes an understanding of the concept of dharma will prevent a person from being able to practice Buddhism. =Contemporary Buddhism= Most Buddhists believe that bad karma (which arises from immoral actions) is the cause of disability. Buddhists also believe in showing compassion towards people less fortunate than themselves (known as songsarn), including towards the disabled, which is believed by Buddhists to help build their own good karma. This has mixed consequences for people with disabilities living in predominantly Buddhist societies. In societies where Buddhism is the main religion practiced, Buddhists with disabilities have reported that other people have condescending attitudes towards them. The emphasis on compassion has been linked with a reluctance to encourage independence and social participation in people with disabilities.In Thailand, the World Bank reports that because of Buddhism's teachings on showing compassion towards the weak, people often donate money to beggars with disabilities or charities that help the disabled. The World Bank argues that while this kindness can be admirable, it does not promote equality for people with disabilities. Christianity Throughout the history of Christianity, attitudes towards disability have varied greatly. =The Bible= In parts of the Bible physical disability is portrayed as a punishment for sinners. In the New Testament, Jesus is often shown performing miraculous healing those with disabilities, although some believe Jesus still referred to sin as the cause of physical disability. The Bible makes no reference to intellectual disability Contrast this perspective to Christ healing the man born blind (John 9:1-12), where Jesus challenged the view that disability was punishment for sin. “His disciples asked him, \\"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\\" Jesus replied: Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\\" said Jesus, \\"but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.” =Early Christianity= In the Middle Ages, there were two prevailing approaches to those with disabilities. Some priests and scholars took the view that disability was a punishment from God for committing sins, as is often described in the Bible. Others believed that those with disabilities were more pious than non-disabled people. Furthermore, Martin Luther held the view that disability was caused by sin, and is recorded to have recommended to the Prince of Dessau that a young boy with disabilities be drowned. When this suggestion was rebuked, Luther told the prince that Christians should pray for the Devil to be removed from the boy every day. =Contemporary Christianity= Disability is still linked with sin in some denominations of the church and in some cultures where Christianity is the predominant religion. In Ghana, people with mental illnesses and neurological disorders are routinely sent to prayer camps that are linked with Evangelical and Pentecostal churches, to try to overcome their disorder. Prayer camps have been condemned by Human Rights Watch because of the way that people in prayer camps are often treated. Human Rights Watch reports that people living in prayer camps are subject to being chained to objects for prolonged periods, being deprived of food and poor sanitation. Christians with disabilities also report feeling unwelcome when attending church. Many families of children with disabilities in the USA report feeling excluded from Church services because of the attitudes of other members of the congregation. On the other hand, some Christians feel that their faith means they have a duty to care for those with disabilities. As well as this, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has called for the church to become more accepting of those with disabilities. Hinduism =Hindu texts= Ashtavakra who had eight physical deformities, was said to be the author of the Hindu religious text Ashtavakra Gita and was a revered Vedic sage. He is shown to have triumphed over the scholars in King Janaka's court, who mocked his disabilities. The 16th-century Hindu poet and singer Surdas, who was said to have composed more than 125,000 songs, is similarly revered as a great religious figure. In ancient and medieval Hindu society, individuals with disabilities were considered for special employment jobs where their disability would be beneficial for their work; for example, kings who would hire persons with hearing and/or speech impairment to copy confidential government documents. The Bhagavad Gita emphasises detachment from the world and coming to view pain and suffering as neither positive or negative. In the case of suffering, while it brings discomfort, it can also be seen as a positive phenomenon, because it advances a person's spiritual development. Hindu texts advocate that disable people feeling hopeless should go forward in life with a positive manner and attitude by following Dharma. =Contemporary Hinduism= As with Buddhism, Hindus also believe that disability is caused by negative karma, but this is not imposed by an outside punitive force or God. Hinduism also views charitable actions, such as giving money to those in need, as a positive action that will help build a person's good karma for their next life. Although disability can be treated as something that is very shameful societally, with some families confining disabled family members to the home, Hinduism stipulates that it is the Dharmic duty of all able-bodied individuals to care for those with a disability and extend charity to them. In society, people with disabilities can also be pitied for their condition. Islam =Qur'an, Hadith and Sharia Law= In Islam, the cause of disability is not attributed to wrongdoing by the disabled person or their parents. Islam views disability as a challenge set by Allah. The Qur'an urges people to treat people with intellectual disabilities with kindness and to protect people with disabilities. Muhammed is shown to treat disabled people with respect. =Early Islam= In the early Islamic caliphate, Bayt al-mal was established to provide for money for people in need, which included the disabled, which was funded by zakat. In the 16th century, the Islamic scholar Ibn Fahd's book al-Nukat al-Zirâf argued that disability could be caused by disobeying a prophet and also be healed by prophets, although the books faced a widespread backlash at the time. =Contemporary Islam= In Saudi Arabia, there is a strong focus on equality for children and adults with special needs, which is based on Islam's views on disability. Despite the Qur’an’s teachings on treating disabled people with respect, some Muslim due to colonialism doctrine of dawarism families report feelings of shame around having a disabled relative and refuse to allow a disabled person to participate in key aspects of Islam, such as attending the Mosque and fasting for Ramadan. however this is now been changed through awareness of many Islamic disability Organizations Judaism =The Torah= In the Torah, disability is caused by Yahweh, as a punishment for transgressions. Although, God also commands Jews in Israel to \\"not insult the deaf, or place a stumbling block before the blind\\". As well as this, Halakha states that people should support sick people. =Contemporary Judaism= A poll of American Jews with disabilities found that less than 1 in 5 Jews felt that Jewish institutions were doing \\"very well\\" or \\"extremely well\\" in including disabled people in community activities. As well as this, Jewish day schools are exempt from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In Israel, a study on the Haredi community found strong support for integrating children with disabilities into mainstream schools.

Background  Alva Jandreau served in the U.S. Army from May 1957 to May 1959. In 1997, the Veteran filed a claim for residuals of a right shoulder injury. He provided a statement that his right shoulder condition started while in basic training, when he had dislocated his shoulder. He submitted numerous statements on his own behalf, including a statement from a fellow serviceman supporting his claim. He also submitted a medical report from a doctor that opined that his condition was \\"[r]ight shoulder pain, most likely sequelae of his dislocation of the shoulder.\\" Lastly, he submitted medical reports showing a history of a right shoulder dislocation and pain. The VA Regional Office denied the claim, citing that there was no evidence of continuity of symptomatology since service. The Board of Veterans' Appeals upheld the denial, reasoning that the report from his doctor simply transcribed Jandreau's own lay history. The Board also found that the statements provided by the Veteran and his fellow service member were not competent, as diagnosing a medical condition, it reasoned, is beyond the range of common experience and knowledge. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ultimately affirmed the Board's decision, holding that competent medical evidence is required when the issue at hand deals with medical etiology or a medical diagnosis.  Analysis  The Federal Circuit, relying on the holding of the Buchanan vs. Nicholson case, found that the Court had erred in its holding. In its analysis, it provided the following framework for when lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis: # A layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, # The layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or # Lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional  Decision  The decision was reversed and remanded.

Despite concerted effort, Boudewijn Hendricksz was unable to overcome the fortress. Boudewijn Hendricksz (died 1626) (also known as Hendrikszoon, Bowdoin Henrick to the English, and Balduino Enrico to the Spanish) was a Dutch corsair and later Admiral. He is most famous for his role in the Battle of San Juan (1625) during the Eighty Years' War, in which he tried but failed to capture San Juan from Spanish forces. In the same year, prior the assault on San Juan he attempted to recapture Bahia, Brazil after the Spanish overcame Dutch forces in the city. (Spanish) He was at one point also one of the burgemeesters of Edam. Military campaigns In 1625 the Dutch West India Company ordered Hendrijks to rescue Bahia, which was held by the Dutch hands but had been attacked by the Spaniards. He was given 34 ships with good artillery and 6,500 men, but by the time he arrived in Brazil the Spanish had already expelled the Dutch from the town. Hendricksz 1625 attack on San Juan, Puerto Rico Several days after the Dutch surrender, a relief fleet of 33 ships under Admiral Boudewijn Hendricksz, seconded by Vice Admiral Andries Veron, bearded down upon the bay divided in two columns.Marley p.110 Toledo, who was warned about its arrival, disposed 6 galleons to lure them to a murderous crossfire. However, seeing the large Spanish-Portuguese fleet anchored inside, Hendricksz decided to withdraw to open sea. Spanish warships attempted to pursue him but a galleon ran aground and the chase was abandoned.Marley p.110 Hendricksz divided his fleet in three groups. One of them returned to Holland with the supplies and ammunition for the garrison of Salvador; the other two attacked respectively the Spanish Caribbean colonial town of San Juan de Puerto Rico and the Portuguese African trading post of the Castle of Elmina but were both decisively defeated. The Dutch fleet then sailed to Paraíba where it was split into two. Half of the ships, commanded by Veront, sailed to Africa. The other 17 ships were commanded by Hendrijks himself, and went to Puerto Rico with the intention of capturing it. On 24 September 1625, Hendrijks arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men and sent a message to the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haro, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haros refused; he was an experienced military man and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.Historias de Puerto Rico by Paul G. Miller, (1947) pgs. 221–237. Seventeenth-century Spanish painting commemorating Hendricksz's defeat at San Juan de Puerto Rico; by Eugenio Caxés, Museo del Prado De Haro realized that an invasion was inevitable and ordered Captain Juan de Amézqueta, plus 300 men stationed at \\"San Felipe del Morro Castle\\" (also known as \\"El Morro\\") and the city of San Juan evacuated. He also had former governor Juan de Vargas organize an armed resistance in the interior of the island. On September 25 Hendrijks attacked San Juan, besieging El Morro Castle and La Fortaleza (the Governor's Mansion). He invaded the capital city and set up his headquarters in La Fortaleza. The Dutch were counterattacked by Captain Juan de Amézqueta and 50 members of the civilian militia on land and by the cannons of the Spanish troops in El Morro Castle. The land battle left 60 Dutch soldiers dead and Hendrijks with a sword wound to his neck which he received from the hands of Amézqueta, who is considered as one of the best swordsman of the island.\\"DON JUAN DE HARO Y LOS HOLANDESES\\" (24 de Septiembre de 1625) \\"El Morro, testigo inconquistable; Colección Espalda\\"; Author José Morales-Dorta; Publisher: Isla Negra Editores, 2006; pages 60-73; , 9781932271799 The Dutch ships at sea were boarded by the Puerto Ricans who defeated the Dutch in the land battle. After a long battle, the Spanish soldiers and volunteers of the city's militia were able to defend the city from the attack and save the island from an invasion. On October 21, Enrico set La Fortaleza and the city ablaze. Captains Amézqueta and Andrés Botello decided to put a stop to the destruction and led 200 men in an attack against the enemy's front and rear guard.

He then tried to invade the island by attacking the town of Aguada. He was again defeated by the local militia and abandoned the idea of invading Puerto Rico. The privateer then went on to Santo Domingo, where he engaged another fort, and later sailed on to Margarita. On 22 February he arrived at Pampatar, which he took easily, and disembarked in a village now called Porlamar. But these limited successes did not recompense the outlay made in the equipping of his fleet. He then decided to head to Havana, whose defenses he studied for some time, until he ultimately decided that it was folly to try to take it.

Several of the manga's prominent characters hold Go titles. The title holder is then called by a combination of their name and the title they hold. In the case of a multiple title holder the most prestigious title they hold is used. The 7 major titles mentioned are Kisei, Meijin, Honinbō, Jūdan, Tengen, Ōza, and Gosei. Main characters =Hikaru Shindo= ; Hikaru is the Main Protagonist of Hikaru no Go and a sixth grader in elementary school. An important factor in the development of Hikaru's passion for Go is an encounter early on in which Hikaru becomes the rival of Go prodigy Akira Toya. At first, he thinks that Go is just for old folks and he is annoyed at Sai's demand to play, but little by little his passion for Go increases as he plays more and more. From being a member of a school Go club to becoming an Insei and finally a professional Go player (at 14 years old) a year after Akira, Hikaru matures throughout the course of the series. Throughout the series, Hikaru gets older in age as the series follow him from 6th grade to high school. Hikaru is often portrayed wearing clothing having the numeral \\"5\\". This is a pun on the Japanese word for five: 五, which is pronounced go. Part of his strength is his ability to read far into the game very fast, and to make seemingly stupid moves, which, in fact, lure the opponent to playing what looks like the obviously correct move, which Hikaru then uses against them. =Fujiwara no Sai= ; A spirit from the Heian era of Japan and mentor of Hikaru Shindo. Once the Go instructor to the Emperor, Sai continually plays Go, his goal being to one day play the divine move. Sai's ghost had previously possessed the real-life figure Honinbo Shusaku who became a renowned Go player. Sai holds a rivalry towards Koyo Toya and through Hikaru persuades Koyo to have a game with him; with his wish realized when they play a game through the Internet. After the legendary match that ends with Sai's triumph by the narrowest margin (a ½ point), Hikaru discovers another move which would have turned the game around. Witnessing Hikaru's maturity, Sai comes to feel that his one-thousand-year time in the world is going to end without his fulfilling his wish of obtaining the divine move; but he reasons that perhaps he was fated to awaken and teach Hikaru, who might obtain it in the future. A few days after the game with Koyo, Sai suddenly disappears as he feared he would. Hikaru was dozing during their last game, so he could neither terminate his last match with Hikaru nor say goodbye to him. Sai is gone, leaving Hikaru depressed and wanting to quit the game. When Hikaru plays Isumi, Hikaru realizes that he will continue to play Go, for Sai lives on in Hikaru's Go. Extremely effeminate by today's standards, Sai is often drawn with traditionally feminine features and mannerisms. Yumi Hotta has joked about fans mistakenly calling him a \\"she\\" in the \\"intermission\\" pages of the manga. Sai's extremely emotional behavior is also proper for a Heian male; he sometimes cries copiously in chibi style, soaking his long sleeves with tears, which in his own time would be respected as a sign of intelligence and sensitivity. His name Fujiwara suggests that he is related to a noble family of extremely high prestige in the Heian period, the Fujiwara clan. Sai has a high sense of honor, abhorring cheating and bullying. =Akira Toya= ; Hikaru's biggest rival and Kaio Middle School student. The son of Koyo Toya, Akira is already playing Go at a professional level when Hikaru first begins playing. Akira is amazed by Hikaru's seemingly impossible ability and becomes obsessed with discovering the secret behind Hikaru's strength. Meanwhile, Hikaru is impressed with how serious and focused Akira is on the game despite only being a 6th grader like him. As the series goes along, the plot brings these two characters together to play each other under different circumstances, each time adding to the mystery. Haze Middle School =Akari Fujisaki= ; Hikaru's childhood friend. She learns a little bit about Go, when Hikaru becomes interested, and she later joins the Haze Middle School Go club, serving as vice captain of the girls' team, despite her being a weak player. She loves Hikaru, as noted by her two friends and various other characters. Hikaru shows interest in her only little by little, though. The two remain friends throughout the course of the series. =Kimihiro Tsutsui= ; Captain and founder of the Haze Middle School Go Club. Initially he relies on a strategy book, though he has excellent Yose (end game) skills. Kaga persuades him to abandon the book in favor of trusting his strength. When he founded the Haze Middle School Go club he is the only member, but through the efforts of Hikaru and Akari the club grows. Kimihiro graduates from Haze Middle School before his dream of defeating the Kaio Middle School Go club can be realized. =Tetsuo Kaga= ; President of Haze Middle School's Shogi club. Kaga hates Go and prefers Shogi because his father forbade it and forced him to play Go from an extremely early age, and he could never please the old man no matter how well he did, because he always lost to Akira Toya. In a flashback to Kaga's childhood, he is not only defeated by Akira, he feels disrespected by Akira's detached attitude towards his opponents. He still plays Go from time to time to keep his skills limber. During the course of the series, he (along with Kimihiro Tsutsui) graduates from Haze Middle School. =Masako Kaneko= A player at the Go Club who is also a member of the Volleyball Club =Yuki Mitani= ; A player at the Go Club at Haze Middle School who overcomes his cheating habit. He is angry at Hikaru for choosing to be an Insei rather than stay at the school Go club when they have a tournament around the corner. Yuki and Hikaru are no longer seen as friends. When After Sai leaves and Hikaru said he wants to stop playing go, Yuki got mad at him because he left the club and got so far he became a pro to catch up to Akira Toya, and now he wants to quit. Yuki remains in the Go club, but only after much convincing. =Kumiko Tsuda= : Kumiko Tsuda is one of Akari Fujisaki's friends and student in Haze Middle School. =Natsume= =Hitoshi Koike= Insei =Yoshitaka Waya= ; : Hikaru's \\"big brother\\" Insei. Like Kaga, he has a dislike for Akira Toya because he can never defeat him and because of what he perceives as Akira's disdain for his opponents. He has once faced Sai in internet Go using the nickname 'zelda.' He becomes a pro (at age 15) in the same year as Hikaru. He is also known to be very reckless and short-tempered, even punching former Insei Mashiba in the face because the latter rattled his friend Isumi. =Shinichiro Isumi= ; : Another Insei friendly with Hikaru, Isumi is the eldest in Hikaru's peer group, turning 18 during the series. He appears to be doing very well in the first pro exam shown, going undefeated until his match with Hikaru. During that match, rumors about Hikaru's incredible strength add to the pressure of time constraints, and he misplaces a stone; his attempt to move the stone after letting go of it prompts his honorable resignation before Hikaru can accuse him of cheating. The match weighs on his mind and he loses his next two games and the chance to become a pro. He later goes to study Go in China in one of the few character arcs in the series that does not center on Hikaru. There, he learns to control his emotions and passes the next year's pro exam without a single loss. Isumi also unknowingly helps Hikaru get over his grief for Sai when their practice game makes Hikaru realize that by playing, he can find Sai within his moves, the Go that Sai passed on to Hikaru. =Kosuke Ochi= ; : Yet another Insei in the same group as Hikaru, Ochi is one of the youngest (12 years old when introduced), yet very outspoken about his ability. His bragging about his strength hides his insecurity; after each loss he is known to disappear into the restroom for long periods of time. Akira tutors him to find out about Hikaru's current strength. Ochi is unnerved by Hikaru because Akira's obsession about him seems to suggest there is more to Hikaru than what Ochi knows. Ochi is also angry that Akira acknowledges Hikaru as a rival, but not Ochi himself. He demands that Akira view him as a rival if he can defeat Hikaru in the pro exam. Ochi loses to Hikaru, but does pass the pro exam. He comes from a wealthy family, as evidenced by the number of pros that come to his household to tutor him privately in Go. =Yuta Fukui= ; : Nicknamed , an Insei and classmate of Waya who is known for his extremely fast-paced style of play. Although Waya is the stronger player, he cannot seem to defeat Fuku. Hikaru loses one game to him during the pro exam. =Asumi Nase= ; : The only female Insei that has a prominent role in the series. She is able to defeat Honda in the pro exams. =Toshinori Honda= : Toshinori Honda (本田敏則 Honda Toshinori) is a strong insei who almost makes the top three players in the professional exam. He eventually became a Professional along with Isumi and Kadowaki. =Ryo Iijma= : Ryo Iijima was an insei who notices Hikaru's growth. Iijima was outraged when he learns from Waya that Waya's group helped Hikaru by taking him to Go salons, because of the fact that Hikaru was the whole group's \\"competition\\" for obtaining the status of a Go professional. Iijima later decides to quit. Professional =Koyo Toya Meijin= ; Akira Toya's father and professional Go player, known as ; Meijin being one of the titles he earned. He rivals Sai and like Sai he also pursues the divine move. Following his defeat by Sai he retires from the Japanese Go circuit and plays in China. He has an interest in Hikaru and requested to play him in the Beginner Dan series after Hikaru becomes a pro. =Kuwabara= ; : An elderly professional and current holder of the Honinbo title. Kuwabara is friends with Toya Meijin, but rivals Ogata, whose challenge he defeats. In his title defence next year, he defeats the young fast-improving Kurata. He is able to vaguely sense Sai's presence, and develops an interest in Hikaru. Kuwabara bets on Hikaru in his Beginner Dan series game. Kuwabara was Shusaku's real family name. =Shigeo Morishita= ; Also known as Morishita Sensei or Mr. Morishita, is a 9-dan pro who is Waya's go teacher and leader of the study group which Hikaru also frequents on Waya's invitation. He considers Koyo Toya a rival, since the two of them became pros at the same time. Morishita also mentors Michio Shirakawa (7-dan), the community Go leader. =Seiji Ogata= ; : A Go professional who recognizes Hikaru's talent when he comments on a Go move during a children's tournament that even professional Go players would take some time to see (although this is Sai's insight - Hikaru had not yet attained much skill by this time). He is also a student of Koyo Toya and soon takes the Judan and Gosei titles when Koyo Toya retires. =Shinoda= Is a Professional Go Player and the Insei Instructor for the Insei Classes =Zama Oza= Zama (座間), a.k.a. Zama Oza (座間王座 Zama Ōza) - The current holder of the Oza title. He play Akira Toya in Shinshodan Series and beat him. =Michio Shirakawa= : A 7-dan Go player and the community Go leader.

He later become the manager for Japan Team for the Hokuto Cup and let Hikaru play as Japan first against Korea First Ko Yongha. Kaio Middle School =Kaoru Kishimoto= ; : Kaio Middle School Go club president and former Insei who did not become a professional. He played Akira in a game, and had to resign early and admitted he was outclassed and right not to pursue professional play. Later he plays a match against Hikaru to gauge his strength, and defeats him easily. His dismissive attitude to Hikaru's plan to rise to Akira's level while playing in the school club spurs Hikaru on to register as an Insei. His liking for black coffee allows Hikaru to realize that he is the failed Insei that the others are discussing shortly after Hikaru becomes an Insei. =Mr Yun= ;Mr. Yun : Yun is Akira's Middle School teacher who is in charge of the school Go club. He is originally from Korea. He worked as a go instructor for children in Korea, and was initially disappointed in young Go players in Japan, until he joined the Kaio faculty. =Yuri Hideka= ; : A 3rd year Kaio Middle School student who stands up for Akira when he gets bullied by three other members of the Go club who resent his presence in the club. She hates bullying of all kinds, but this does not stop her from bullying others. =Ito Kojima and Okumura= ;, Three students who dislike Akira Toya's presence in the Kaio Middle School Go club, and try to humiliate him into quitting the club by making him play \\"blind Go\\" (i.e. calling out the moves without looking at the Go board, like blindfold chess). Yuri Hidaka catches them in the act and puts a stop to the bullying. Other characters =Harumi Ichikawa= ; Ms. Ichikawa is the cashier of the Go salon owned by the Toyas. She feels saddened when Akira frequents the club less often because of his pro schedule, and refuses to start calling him \\"sensei\\" when he goes pro, preferring to keep calling him by the nickname \\"Akira-kun\\". She frequently drives him to different places and he sometimes tutors her in Go. =Shu= ; The owner of a Go salon where Hikaru finds Yuki Mitani. Shu recognises that Mitani is cheating, so he hires Dake-san to teach him a lesson. =Dake= ; A Go hustler hired by Shu to teach Yuki Mitani not to cheat. He poses as a regular at the Go salon and hides his strength. He bets money on the game and wins 10,000 yen (about $110 US) from Yuki. Hikaru and Sai later win the money back, and Hikaru uses this to persuade him to join the school Go club. Dake sings romantic songs while playing Go as part of his act to appear like a harmless buffoon, and plays with his right hand (although he is left-handed) to appear clumsy. =Heihachi Shindo= ; Hikaru's grandfather, a regional Go champion, who owns the board where Hikaru first discovered Sai. He claims his brother bought the board in an antique shop, intrigued by the rumor that a \\"ghost in a tall hat\\" would appear from it sometimes.

Hikaru, Waya, and Isumi travel to Go salons to sharpen their skills while they are Insei. In one of them they meet Suyong, whose uncle runs a Go salon, while Su-Yong is on vacation from Korea. At the time, Su-Yong is a Yeon'gusaeng (the Korean equivalent of an Insei), but is disillusioned with playing Go.

The film features Samuthirakani himself in the lead role, with Vikranth, Sunaina, Arthana Binu, Gouri Nair, and Namo Narayana amongst others in pivotal roles. The music is composed by Justin Prabhakaran with editing by A. L. Ramesh. The venture began production in December 2016 and had a theatrical release on 26 May 2017.  Plot  Narayanan (Namo Narayana) is the son of Central Minister Pandiyanar (G. Gnanasambandam). Narayanan uses his father's name to make money by corruption, much to the latter's dismay. One day, some goons try to kill a man in daylight, as instructed by Narayanan. The man is lying in a pool of blood, and a local person witnesses this and informs this to the ambulance. The ambulance driver is Maha Vishnu (Samuthirakani), a kindhearted man who has never let anyone whom he has taken in his ambulance die. Vishnu admits the man in the hospital, and he is saved. Narayanan is angry with Vishnu for saving his enemy, for which he replies that saving the lives of people is his duty. Vishnu is married to Bagalamugi (Sunaina). He has a father (Vela Ramamoorthy) and sister Mahishasuramardini (Arthana Binu). The latter is stalked by Vicky (Vikranth), a drunkard and jobless youth who happens to be a friend of Vishnu. Vishnu convinces Vicky to reform and attend the medical technician course. Vicky completes it successfully and saves people's lives, earning the love of Vishnu and his family. Mahi has a friend named Gowri (Gouri Nair), who is stalked by Narayanan's brother Chinna Pandi (Soundararaja), and she beats him in a bus. Insulted by this, Chinna Pandi beats Gowri up with a wooden log. Enraged, Mahi and the students kill him. Vishnu arrives with his ambulance to admit Chinna Pandi to the hospital. To avoid traffic, he takes the outer bypass, infuriating Narayanan. Chinna Pandi succumbs to the injury. Narayanan blames Vishnu for this and beats him up, but he is saved by the public. Narayanan vows to kill Vishnu. Vishnu gets mad after his father loses his hearing ability and his wife suffers a miscarriage. Deeply saddened by this, he confronts Narayanan, who pleads that he is innocent. Vishnu believes that being a common man, he cannot do anything against a powerful man who has political support. Narayanan bribes Inspector Uthaman (Anil Murali) and three government officials and has them under his control. Vishnu is helped by Sub-Inspector Rahman (Poraali Dileepan). Vishnu plans to destroy Narayanan and bring him to justice. He gathers all the details of the properties owned by Narayanan and a video footage of him insulting Uthaman and the government officials while bribing from Narayanan's auditor, who helps Vishnu because he once saved his wife's life. Vishnu realizes that Narayanan used Pandiyanar's name to earn huge amounts of money and buy so many properties by corruption. Vishnu sends the evidences them to IT, Vigilance, and other departments. He also sends the video footage to Uthaman's wife and the government officials' wives, who lose respect among their family. Uthaman and the government officials decide to stop supporting Narayanan for his further actions. The IT department raids Narayanan's house, confiscates all of his belongings, and arrests him. Narayanan tries to escape but meets with an accident. While he is struggling, Vishnu comes with his ambulance and saves him.

He stated that production would begin by the end of the year, with Allari Naresh also selected to play a role. However Jayam Ravi's busy schedule during 2016 and 2017 meant that the pair could not eventually work together. The film re- materialised during December 2016, with Vikranth signed on to portray the role originally assigned to Naresh, while Samuthirakani himself would play the lead role. Vikranth revealed that he would star in the project alongside commitments to work in Suseenthiran's ventures Vennila Kabaddi Kuzhu 2 and Nenjil Thunivirundhal. Samuthirakani stated the film would be about \\"simple men, their lives, problems and pain\\" and \\"these are people who provide a service to the society; they might earn a less salaries, but they definitely get more satisfaction out of life\\". He added that the film would tackle several social issues in India including demonetisation, corruption in politics, the farmers' plight, jallikattu and the harassment of women. Production began during early December 2016, with Sunaina added to the cast after Samuthirakani was impressed with her performance in Neerparavai (2012).  Soundtrack  The film's music was composed by Justin Prabhakaran and featured five songs. The album was released on 9 April 2017 through Yuvan Shankar Raja's U1 Records label.  Release  The film had a theatrical release across Tamil Nadu on 26 May 2017, alongside Radha Mohan's Brindavanam (2017 film), and earned mixed to negative reviews. The satellite rights of the film were sold to Zee Tamil. Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion wrote \\"All of which would be okay...if there was a grain of good filmmaking. But the utterly generic bring-down-the-bad-guy story is preposterous, and scenes go on and on.\\" Reception Anupama Subramaniam of the Deccan Chronicle wrote Thondan is an \\"interesting film sans entertainment values\\" and \\"all is well and good, but things do become a bit self-righteous and annoying when a fictional film begins to give you lessons on ethics and morality\\". India Today's review stated that \\"Thondan is Samuthirakani's TED Talk in Tamil that runs for more than two hours\\", adding that it is \\"an uninteresting social commentary\\". On a positive note, film critic Santhosh Mathevan wrote, \\"Kani documents a lot of true events, and he also comes out with some real time and cinematic references in his screenplay.\\" He also criticised, \\"Usually, the mercury level of preaching would always touch the peak of thermometer in every of Kani's movie. But, Thondan has let the mercury bulb burst, as the film seems to be a 138 minute-tight-pack of loads of moral values to teach.\\" Sify.com stated the film was \\"filled with a plethora of messages in an over preachy tone\\". A critic from The New Indian Express wrote the film was \\"a basket of moral lectures\\", concluding \\"Thondan is what you feared would happen once Appa (2016) did as well as it did\\". Baradwaj Rangan rated the film 1 out of 5 and wrote, \\"As expected, actor and director Samuthirakani, delivers yet another sermon disguised as a movie\\". The film took a lukewarm opening at the Chennai box office and fared averagely commercially.

Background  Yan Xu was born in 910, during the reign of Yang Longyan the Prince of Wu. His father Yan Keqiu was a prominent politician serving under Wu's regent Xu Wen. In or around 918, when Xu Wen was faced with the issue of whether to have his older, but adoptive, son Xu Zhigao continue to serve as the junior regent under him, or displace Xu Zhigao with a younger biological son, Xu Zhixún, Yan Keqiu was advocating for Xu Zhixún. Xu Zhigao tried to expel Yan out of the Wu central government to serve as the prefect of Chu Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu), but Yan was able to persuade Xu Wen to let him remain. Xu Zhigao thereafter tried to make peace between himself and Yan Keqiu by agreeing to give a daughter in marriage to Yan Xu, although it was unclear whether the marriage occurred that year or not.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. When Yan Xu was in his teenage years, Yan Keqiu was serving as a chancellor. As the chancellor's son, Yan Xu was made a guard officer for then-Wu emperor Yang Pu (Yang Longyan's brother and successor), and then later Mishu Lang (秘書郎, an assistant at the Palace Library). While Yan Xu's household was rich and honored in his youth, he was nevertheless humble and diligent. After Xu Zhigao seized the throne in 937, ending Wu and starting Southern Tang (and subsequently changing his name to Li Bian),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Yan Xu was made the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang) and Shangshu Zuo Cheng (), one of the secretaries general at the executive bureau of government (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng).  During Li Jing's reign  Li Bian died in 943 and was succeeded by his oldest son Li Jing.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. Subsequently, Yan Xu was made minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu), and then Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎, deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). At that time, many of the politicians at the Southern Tang court were allies of the senior chancellor Song Qiqiu. Both Yan and the imperial scholar Chang Mengxi () were known for their independence and faithfulness. Li Jing once spoke to Chang, stating, \\"Among the key officials, only Yan Xu is fair and independent, but he lacks abilities. I am afraid he cannot overcome the partisans. You, sir, should help him.\\" However, not long after, Chang was relieved of his duties of being in charge of the Xuanzheng Hall (), where he drafted edicts for Li Jing (albeit remaining as imperial scholar), and Yan was sent out of the imperial government to serve as the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Chi Prefecture (池州, in modern Chizhou, Anhui), such that Chang became distressed and no longer involved himself in affairs of state.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Subsequently, the official Jiang Wenwei () publicly stated at an imperial gathering, \\"Yan Xu is a highly decorated relative of the emperor and is an important official. Now, because he does not join the party of the wicked, he gets expelled. Of course, we will know what will happen to the rest of us.\\" As a result of this public declaration, Song's partisans felt compelled to have Yan recalled back to the imperial government to again serve as Zhongshu Shilang and the director of the three financial agencies (taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies). However, he was later again sent out of the imperial government to serve as the military governor of Fenghua Circuit (奉化, headquartered in Jiujiang, Jiangxi). After Yan served for several years at Fenghua, he was again recalled to the imperial government to be Zhongshu Shilang and acting head of the executive bureau (尚書省, Shangshu Sheng). In 955, Li Jing made him chancellor and Menxia Shilang (門下侍郎, deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng)).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292. In 958, after Southern Tang was forced to cede territories north of the Yangtze River to its northern rival Later Zhou and submit as a vassal state to Later Zhou, Li Jing demoted the titles of most of his high-level officials to show humility to Later Zhou, and Yan was made Taizi Shaofu (), an advisor to Li Jing's son, Li Hongji the Crown Prince. Shortly after this, Yan's political rival Chen Jue, after returning from a diplomatic mission to Later Zhou, falsely claimed that Later Zhou's emperor Guo Rong blamed Yan for resisting Later Zhou and ordered Li Jing to put him to death. Li Jing knew of the enmity between Chen and Yan and therefore did not believe the order. He had another official, Zhong Mo (), go to the Later Zhou court to verify with Guo; Guo replied that, based on what Li Jing had informed him, Yan was a faithful Southern Tang subject, and he would surely not want Yan put to death. After Zhong reported back to Li Jing, Li Jing realized of the Song party's treachery. He thus had Chen put to death, and forced Song and another Song partisan, Li Zhenggu (), put to death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. In 960, the Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin overthrew Guo Rong's son and successor Guo Zongxun, establishing Song dynasty (as its Emperor Taizu), to which Southern Tang continued to be a vassal state. When Guo Rong's cousin Li Chongjin rose against the Song emperor at Yang Prefecture (揚州, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), the Song emperor defeated him quickly, and he committed suicide. With the Song emperor just north of the Yangtze from the Southern Tang capital Jinling, Li Jing, in fear that the Song emperor had more designs than just to destroy Li Chongjin, sent Yan (and later his son Li Congyi () and the official Feng Yanlu) to pay tribute to the Song emperor, who subsequently, after demonstrating his troop strength, withdrew.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. Still, Li Jing decided to move the capital from Jinling to Nanchang, which he did in 961, leaving then-crown prince Li Congjia (as Li Hongji had died by that point) in charge at Jinling as regent, with Yan, then carrying the title of You Pushe (), serving as the acting chief of staff, assisted by Tang Yue ().Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2.  During Li Yu's reign  Li Jing died later in 961, and after his casket was returned to Jinling for burial, Li Congjia took the throne, changed his name to Li Yu, and decided to keep the capital at Jinling rather than Nanchang. Li Yu gave Yan Xu the title of Sikong (司空, one of the Three Excellencies) and again made him chancellor. Not long after, there was a controversial proposal by the official Han Xizai, who advocated that iron be used for coins, as the supply of old Tang coins, made of copper, was being depleted, and Southern Tang's then territory lacked copper for new coins. Yan vehemently opposed Han's proposal, but Li Yu approved of Han's proposal — which led to high inflation, as the people, lacking trust in the new iron coins, continued to use copper coins and trading them at over 10 times the value of iron coins, much to Han's regret.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 3. It was said that as chancellor to Li Yu, Yan was honest and loyal, but lacked knowledge, such that the people he entrusted with responsibilities lacked the proper abilities. Someone — possibly Jiang Wenwei — wrote a poem entitled Ode to a Crab to satirize Yan. Further, at that time, because there were many military matters, it ended up that main decisions were made at the office of the chief of staff (in charge of military matters), and Yan's words were not often listened to. Sometime in or prior to 965, at Yan's request, he was made the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (鎮海, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). He was at Zhenhai for more than a year, when he, due to illness, requested to return to his mansion (probably at Jinling), and he died there, shortly after new year 967. He was given posthumous honors.

It was built in 1911 over Egyptian prime minister Boutros Ghali's tomb. History The church was built in 1911 over the tomb of Boutros Ghali, Egypt's prime minister from 1908 until his assassination in 1910. Its building process was supervised by Ghali's family. His grandson, Boutros Boutros Ghali, sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations and former Egyptian minister of foreign affairs, was also buried in the crypt beneath the altar in February 2016. Originally named Saint Peter and Saint Paul's Church, it became known over the years as the Botroseya Church, the first church to be named after a political family. On 11 December 2016, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the church, killing up to 25 people, mostly women and children, and injuring many others. Design The church is considered by local historians to be of high religious and artistic value. It was designed in the basilica style by Italo-Slovene architect Antonio Lasciac, Khedive Isma'il Pasha's designated chief architect, with 28 meters in length and 17 meters in width. The central nave is separated from the aisles by a row of marbled columns on each side, above which are a series of Italian paintings depicting the life of Jesus, his apostles and a number of saints. At the end of the central aisle is a two-step plate of black marble containing Boutros Ghali's supposed final words. Venetian mosaics can be found on the walls, including one depicting the baptism of Jesus on the Jordan River, and another one behind the sanctuary showing Jesus above a dome, with the Virgin Mary to his right and Mark the Evangelist to his left.

It is based on the mechanical arcade game Ice Cold Beer and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on MacOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a tepid critical reception for the game's slow sales, but were proud of their work.  Gameplay  TumbleSeed begins in a quiet forest village disturbed by angry creatures creating holes in the ground. A seed is tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles to reach the top of a mountain. With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing the momentum of the seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life (\\"heart\\") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: A seed that falls into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns to the bottom of the mountain to try again. While ascending the mountain, the player activates helpful power-up abilities by collecting and planting minerals in marked plots. While there are over 30 abilities in total, the player starts with the basic four: Flagseed creates an additional checkpoint (in lieu of regressing further down the mountain upon losing a heart), Heartseed creates additional hearts from minerals, and the Crystal ability generates minerals from multiple plots. Thornvine's single-use, protective thorny vine can hurt enemies if aligned correctly, though some enemies require more than one hit to die, and the player forfeits all thorns upon losing a heart. As the game progresses, the player collects additional abilities, such as Flailflower, which turns the seed into an anchor for a spiky flail, and Floodfruit, which fills surrounding holes with water for easy passage. Thus the player constantly weighs whether to use minerals offensively (to eliminate enemies), defensively (to bypass difficult sections), or at all. After completing a portion of the mountain, the player reaches a basecamp intermezzo with multiple opportunities for collecting new abilities. The player can trade minerals for abilities in the store, and choose between two abilities to receive for free. The basecamp also contains minigames, such as a shooting range, a gambling device, and optional sidequests, which reward the player with shortcuts to later stages in subsequent playthroughs for completing challenges such as finishing a level within a time limit or without receiving damage. Some enemies move in predictable patterns and others hunt the player. They range in resemblance from larvae and vultures to spiders. While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as a forest, a desert, and snow, and each section of the mountain introduces new enemies that force the player to modify their strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped creatures who occasionally have hats. Their dialogue is visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges. The Four Peaks patch adds several elements to make the game friendlier, including training levels, a Weekly Challenge, and benefits that persist between playthroughs. The Battle Mode, exclusive to the Nintendo Switch release, is a King of the Hill-style mode for two players to compete to hold a set region for the longest.  Development  TumbleSeed development staff The game is based on Ice Cold Beer, a mechanical arcade game in which the player controls the ends of a metal rod to raise a rolling, metal ball vertically in a wooden cabinet while avoiding holes cut into the wood. The Chicago-based indie development team found the machine at an arcade where they competitively played the 2013 video game Killer Queen. Developer Benedict Fritz later prototyped a version of Ice Cold Beer in the Unity game engine with a simple white background and black, circular holes. His friend, designer Greg Wohlwend, who had previously worked on Threes and Ridiculous Fishing, saw a short, online video of Fritz's prototype and the two began to work together on the project by adding enemies, an in-game world, and procedurally generated levels. Their prototypes included dungeon crawl and open world, action-adventure genre explorations. They spent two years designing the title and wanted to honor and contribute to the legacy of Ice Cold Beer. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production: David Laskey, Jenna Blazevich, and composer Joel Corelitz. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree \\"as indie as indie gaming gets\\". The team released a promotional trailer in August 2016 ahead of a demo at the PAX West game show. With the announcement of the Nintendo Switch, the development team sought to become a \\"flagship\\" demonstration of the console's HD Rumble feature, in which the player proprioceptively \\"feels\\" in-game textures through the controller's fine-tuned vibrations. The developers thought that the Switch's \\"high-fidelity vibration\\" afforded players a greater sense of in-game detail with better perception about the seed's speed and direction. They cold-called Nintendo and began work together in June 2016, prior to the Switch's announcement. Designer Greg Wohlwend saw the game as sharing classic Nintendo attributes, including a wide color palette, accessibility, and difficulty. Nintendo, at the time, was thawing its relations with indie developers by removing restrictions for development on their consoles. Wohlwend said that their partnership was positive and the port of the game's code to the Switch platform was painless. Originally planned for release in 2015, TumbleSeed was released on May 2, 2017, on Nintendo Switch, MacOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The Nintendo Switch release includes an exclusive King of the Hill-style Battle Mode.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers recommended the game, in particular, for short bursts of play with the portable Nintendo Switch. Reviewers considered the Nintendo Switch's HD Rumble a good fit for the game's core rolling mechanic and aesthetics. Nintendo Life said HD Rumble made the Switch's portable mode \\"the definitive way to play\\" TumbleSeed. Its haptic sensation approximated how it felt to play the mechanical Ice Cold Beer. Reviewers additionally compared the Ice Cold Beer conceit to the core mechanic of Shrek n' Roll (2007) and portable, plastic maze puzzles. Multiple reviewers commented on the gameplay's chafing difficulty and uneven difficulty progression. TumbleSeed stops short of the \\"masocore\\" genre of punishingly difficult games, but its imprecise controls nevertheless demand patience to develop proficiency and mastery. At a fundamental level, Eurogamer found the controls \\"maddening and mesmerizing\\", and Polygon, out of frustration, wanted to directly control the seed. The multitasking player is made to \\"never feel safe\\" between balancing encroaching enemies, unpredictable enemy spawns, precarious controls, and easy deaths, all while managing crystal resources. Polygon considered the game's strategic elements, such as deciding whether to go on offense or defense, to be its most interesting aspect. Others focused on TumbleSeed art and movement mechanics, as Wired reviewer appreciated the slow process of learning how it is best to navigate the game and additionally found a new aspect to appreciate each time she played it. Some disagreed as to whether the game's challenge was appropriate and never malicious, or often unbalanced and frustrating compared to its rewards. The randomness of each basecamp's power-up offerings also contributed to uneven difficulty between playthroughs. Metro contended that though TumbleSeed was marketed as a roguelike, apart from its procedurally generated levels, it was closer in genre to traditional arcade games. Though like roguelikes, player mistakes are costly and unforgivingly punished by returning the player to the beginning of the game. Polygon wrote that while this mechanic is acceptable, the act of losing all equipped upgrades upon losing a single heart was harsh. The Guardian saw \\"an obvious throughline\\" between designer Greg Wohlwend's prior work and the colorful, simple, and cute visuals of TumbleSeed. Reviewers wrote that \\"bright art and cheery music\\" made the environment inviting and lively, though not particularly memorable as to distract from the gameplay. Some critics struggled to visually distinguish between cosmetic and active objects. It visually recalled the art of Patapon, according to Nintendo Life. TumbleSeed was a honorable mention for \\"Excellence in Audio\\" at the 2017 Game Developers Conference.  Post-release  A month after release, the developers worked to make the game less difficult, in response to criticism from reviewers. In a postmortem released alongside a set of updates, TumbleSeed designer Greg Wohlwend credited the game's slow sales to the title's tepid critical reception and stigma of high difficulty. Critics, he wrote, considered the game unfair and unforgivingly hard, as reflected in lukewarm scores from major gaming websites. Players were expected to withstand an overwhelming amount of simultaneous elements and as such, few reached the end of the game. The \\"4 Peaks Update\\" added four new areas and abilities to simplify the game, such as reducing incoming damage or increasing stealth near enemies. The game was unlikely to recoup its costs, Wohlwend wrote, and the update was doubtful to change that course, but he felt proud of their development effort and considered the update to be therapy. The June 2017 update was released for Windows and was anticipated for consoles soon after.

Background  The Veteran appealed a Board of Veterans Appeals decision that determined that new and material evidence had not been submitted to reopen his claim for right ear hearing loss and that denied his claim for service connection for tinnitus. The Veteran served on active duty from December 1943 to September 1945. The VA Regional Office denied his original claim for service connection for hearing loss of the right ear in 1945 on the basis that the condition was not found on his discharge examination and there was no in-service treatment for the condition. In 1998, the Veteran filed a reopened claim and a new claim for tinnitus. He was scheduled for an examination in April 1999 and diagnosed with hearing loss and tinnitus. He attended a hearing at the Regional Office in May 1999 and testified regarding his in-service noise exposure and experience of having had ringing in his ears during and since service. The VA Regional Office ultimately did not reopen the finally denied claim for hearing loss, as it held that new and material evidence had not been submitted. The VA Regional Office also denied the claim for tinnitus as being not well grounded. While the claim was pending, the Veterans Claim Assistance Act of 2000 was passed. A Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) was completed and denied the tinnitus as not being incurred in service. The Board of Veterans Appeals upheld the decision, stating that the Veteran had not identified post-service treatment records that VA could obtain on his behalf. The Board stated that the duty to assist had been met. In regards to the hearing loss claim, the Board did not reopen the hearing loss claim because it stated that the Veteran had not provided evidence of a nexus to service. In regards to the tinnitus claim, the Board stated that there was no evidence of a medical nexus and there was no evidence that this condition was incurred in or aggravated by service.  Analysis  The Court stated that in regards to the tinnitus claim, the VA failed to fulfill its duty to assist. The Court pointed out that tinnitus is capable of lay observation. Since the Veteran provided competent and credible lay evidence that the condition “may be associated with [his] active service”, VA’s duty to assist requires that a medical nexus opinion be ordered.  Decision  The Court vacated the 2001 Board decision and the case was remanded for readjudication.

The first recorded Count of Homberg, Rudolf, appears in a record in 1082 when he married Ita von Habsburg. In 1225 the Homberg line died out and the castle was inherited by the Counts of Frohburg. Over the following years a cadet line of the Frohburg family took the name Neu-Homberg and established a new castle Neu-Homburg near Läufelfingen. In 1323 the last Count of Neu- Homberg, Werner III, died and the castle was inherited by Countess Maria von Oettingen. She sold it on 8 August 1351 to Duke Albrecht of Austria for 400 Marks.

In Suriname there certain groups have long adhered to belief in treef, especially among the African descendants.

These prohibitions can vary individually, but it is inextricably related to conditions in the family. A treef is inherited from the father's side, but it can be revealed in a dream, often by a woman. In addition, a woman must take into account special food taboos during pregnancy.

Until the 1950s, lacework was one of the key sources of revenue to the island's economy. The handicraft is still practiced and is a feature of tourism for the island, having been the focus of two books on the subject, as well as a winner of the Prince Bernhard Caribbean Culture Prize. History With few educational opportunities available for women in the 19th century on Saba, Mary Gertrude (née Hassell) Johnson was sent to study at a Venezuelan Catholic convent and learned the intricate craft. She returned in the 1870s and taught others how to make the drawn-thread patterns, made by pulling and tying threads from cotton cloth into lacework designs. When mail service with the outside world was established in 1884, the women of Saba turned their craft into a mail-order industry. Without initial client lists, the women created their own, by writing letters to American companies each time merchandise from the United States was received on the island. By the era of World War I, when the island population was around 2,000 people, 250 women were working in the cottage lace craft. By 1928, Saba lace sales were garnering $15,000 annually from the U.S. alone and had an established reputation for fine craftsmanship. Through the 1950s lacework was one of the leading sources of income for the economy. Cultural significance In 1995, a graduate student from the University of Texas, Eric A. Eliason, came to Saba to research Saban nationalism for his graduate thesis. He recognized that for the women of the island, Saba lace was a large part of their cultural heritage and spoke to their ethic for hard work and passing on tradition. Urged by local women to document the craft, he gathered samples of the lace, making copies of the work on a photocopy machine, which was made available by the tourism department. In 1997, he published The Fruit of Her Hands: Saba Lace, History & Patterns. Publication of the book revitalized both interest in the craft and a desire for preserving its heritage. Women began using the book to learn new patterns. In 2010, with the help of students at Brigham Young University, Eliason prepared a second book, Saba Lace Patterns, which documents both the creators of designs themselves and their signature patterns. Throughout the island there are establishments which sell clothing and table linens which feature Saba lace, which has become an important cultural icon driving tourism. Means and ways to protect Saba lace has been part of consultations held by the Netherlands in their implementation of UNESCO's initiatives to protect and preserve iconic cultural treasures. In 2014, Saba lace and the \\"lace ladies\\" were awarded the Prince Bernhard Caribbean Culture Prize.

He is a former KO-D Openweight Champion, BJW Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion and BJW World Strong Heavyweight Champion. Early life Ishikawa was friends with fellow professional wrestler Takashi Sasaki as a teenager, whom he met through judo. Professional wrestling career =DDT (2003–2018)= Ishikawa (far left) as part of Damnation After meeting Sanshiro Takagi, Ishikawa was invited to a tryout for DDT Pro Wrestling in 2002. Despite failing the tryout, Ishikawa was invited to work for the company anyway and served as an accountant and receptionist for DDT between 2002 and 2003, while occasionally training as a wrestler. When DDT moved into JWP's dojo in 2003, Ishikawa began training more regularly. As the DDT roster was running short due to older wrestlers retiring and others sustaining injuries, Takagi bought Ishikawa up to the main roster with limited training in May 2003. He made his debut at the age of 27 in a loss to Seiya Morohashi. Early in his career and due to his size Ishikawa wore red trunks, red knee pads and black boots as an homage Giant Baba. In 2004, Ishikawa was paired up with Poison Sawada Julie, joining his Serpent Council stable. After achieving little success in his early career, Ishikawa began competing more sporadically in DDT, instead becoming a regular in DDT's sister promotion Union Pro Wrestling, where he gained considerable popularity due to his size. In 2007, Ishikawa officially became recognised as the ace of UPW after Poison Sawada Julie left the promotion. Ishikawa competed in high-profile feuds with Style-E's Kyosuke Sasaki and Pro Wrestling Zero1's Yoshihito Sasaki, as well as regularly competing in DDT once again under a mask as Koo in the Hawaii Army stable. On June 3, 2007, Ishikawa defeated Harashima to capture the KO-D Openweight Championship for the first time. He held on to the belt until October, where he was defeated by Harashima in a rematch. Ishikawa began his second reign in late 2009, defeating Kota Ibushi on November 29, holding it until February 2010, when he was defeated by Daisuke Sekimoto at a Union Pro event. On March 27, 2011, at DDT's 14 Anniversary Show, Ishikawa won a battle royal, giving him the right to a KO-D Openweight Championship match in the future. Ishikawa captured the championship for a third time on May 4, 2011, defeating Dick Togo. Ishikawa held the championship until July, when he was defeated by Kudo at Ryogoku Peter Pan. In 2016, Ishikawa won the KO-D Tag Team Championship for the first time in his career, teaming with Daisuke Sasaki to defeat Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo on March 21. On July 3, Ishikawa and Sasaki lost the title to Ken Ohka and Kai. In May 2016, Ishikawa formed the Damnation stable along with Sasaki, Mad Paulie and later Tetsuya Endo. Ishikawa captured the KO-D Openweight Championship for a fourth time in August 2016, defeating Konosuke Takeshita at Peter Pan. Ishikawa held on to the belt until December, when he was defeated by Harashima at Osaka Octopus.

Irie and Ishikawa held the title until July of that year, when they were defeated by Shinobu and Yuji Okabayashi. Ishikawa defeated longtime rival Abdullah Kobayashi to become the BJW Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion on January 2, 2013, four years after competing in his first ever deathmatch.

After the loss to Kodaka, Ishikawa announced that he would no longer be competing in deathmatches, and would instead be focusing on the strong division. In 2014, Ishikawa achieved his first major success in BJW's strong division, defeating Daisuke Sekimoto to win the Ikkitosen Strong Climb tournament. Later that year, Ishikawa began teaming with Kohei Sato as the \\"Twin Towers\\" with much success, defeating the team of Yuko Miyamoto and Isami Kodaka on May 31, 2014, to win the BJW Tag Team Championships. Ishikawa and Sato successfully retained the championships for 516 days, until they were defeated by Yuji Okabayashi and Daisuke Sekimoto on October 29, 2015. In 2016, Ishikawa won the Ikkitosen Strong Climb Tournament for a second time, defeating Daichi Hashimoto and Hideyoshi Kamitani in the semi-final and final respectively on the same night to win. Ishikawa and Sato once again captured the BJW World Tag Team Championships on May 30, 2016, defeating Hideyoshi Kamitani and Ryota Hama. = All Japan Pro Wrestling (2015–present) = Ishikawa debuted for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in 2015, and in September of that year, took part in the Ōdō Tournament, making it to the semi-final where he was eliminated by Akebono.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=137546 In December, he teamed with Hoshitango in the Real World Tag League, finishing with six points but failing to advance past the group stages.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=142614 On March 27, 2016, Ishikawa and Hoshitango unsuccessfully challenged Zeus and The Bodyguard for the World Tag Team Championship.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=149787 In April 2017, Ishikawa took part in his first Champion Carnival, finishing first in his block and highest of anybody in the tournament with 9 points.

Having previously worked on the Kingdom Hearts series, among various other titles, Final Fantasy XV was her first project for the series. Shimomura was brought on board the project in 2006, when it was a spin-off title called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, and stayed in her role during the game's ten-year development cycle. Her music, based around themes of \\"friendship\\" and \\"filial bonds\\", incorporates multiple musical genres, such as orchestral, bossa nova, and American blues. Several tracks, including the main theme \\"Somnus\\", feature Latin lyrics written by the game's original director Tetsuya Nomura. Final Fantasy XV was expanded into a multimedia project dubbed the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\", for which other composers were hired; John R. Graham composed the music for the film Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, with additional tunes from Shimomura. Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki of Righttrack wrote the music for the original net animation Brotherhood, while a team from the music studio Unique Note, who also worked on the base game, handled the mobile spin-off title Justice Monsters V. English indie rock band Florence and the Machine collaborated on three songs for the game, including a cover of Ben E. King's \\"Stand by Me\\", which acted as the official theme song. Later contributors to the soundtrack, via downloadable content packs, were Keiichi Okabe, Naoshi Mizuta, Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu, Tadayoshi Makino, and Taku Iwasaki. Multiple albums have been released containing music from Final Fantasy XV and its spin-off media. Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack released in December 2016 in multiple versions, including a four-disc CD release, a Blu-ray release with additional tracks, and a special edition. The standard four-disc release was published internationally in 2017 by Sony Classical Records. The score for Kingsglaive released in September 2016 as a two-disc CD. Other releases include a digital album for Justice Monsters V in September 2016, and limited digital albums for both Kingsglaive and Platinum Demo, a commercial demo acting as a prequel to Final Fantasy XV. The songs from Florence and the Machine were released in August 2016 as digital singles under the banner title \\"Songs from Final Fantasy XV\\". Reception of the albums was generally positive, with the main soundtrack album and Welch's tracks reaching high positions on music charts. Creation and development =Final Fantasy XV= Yoko Shimomura served as the lead composer for Final Fantasy XV, writing around 80% of the soundtrack. The musical score for the action role-playing game Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off game called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, was composed primarily by Yoko Shimomura, whose previous work included Parasite Eve, Legend of Mana, and the Kingdom Hearts series. Final Fantasy XV was her first time composing for the Final Fantasy series, so she took a more tentative approach than her Kingdom Hearts projects. Shimomura was involved with the project when XV was still titled Versus XIII, being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year development cycle. In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into an image that seemed wrong. Her work over the time prior to its rebranding as Final Fantasy XV was fairly sporadic. Shimomura worked on around 80% of the music: the rest were variations on her work and other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack. Other composers who worked on the game were Tetsuya Shibata, Yoshino Aoki, Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements. The first track created by Shimomura for the game was \\"Somnus\\", at that time the official theme song. \\"Somnus\\" was sung by Aundréa L. Hopkins; its lyrics were written by original director Tetsuya Nomura, which were translated and adapted into Latin by Taro Yamashita and Kazuhiro Komiya. According to Nomura, the title, which translates from Latin to \\"Sleep\\", reflects the subject matter and real-world themes. An instrumental version was also created for use in Final Fantasy XV, having been recorded at around the same time as the vocal version. When Versus XIII was rebranded as XV, \\"Somnus\\" was retained as the game's main theme, though it was replaced as the official theme song. Another long-standing track was \\"Omnis Lacrima\\". Translating to \\"All the Tears\\", it was featured in trailers for both Versus XIII and Final Fantasy XV. The lyrics for both \\"Omnis Lacrima\\" and other Final Fantasy XV tracks using Latin vocals were written by Nomura and translated by Yamashita. Nomura credited the high use of Latin to his wish for a language that was no longer used on a daily basis and that people \\"won't be able to understand and yet appreciate\\", desiring a sense of general equality. The game's music was designed to encompass themes of \\"friendship\\" and \\"filial bonds\\". Initially, due to its status as a spin-off, Shimomura did not feel the same amount of pressure to conform to the legacy of previous composers. By the time the game changed from Versus XIII to XV, she had a clear idea of what the score would be like and so felt minimal reservations despite the game now being part of the main series. At the same time, she felt the need to respect the work of earlier composers such as Nobuo Uematsu while staying true to the series' legacy of musical variety. Despite the ten year development, the musical concepts Shimomura worked from did not change much: she constantly aimed at creating a darker score than other Final Fantasy titles. Ultimately, only a third of Shimomura's completed work for Versus XIII was carried over into Final Fantasy XV. New elements were added when the game became Final Fantasy XV, but that was to suit the new elements being introduced rather than overwriting previous work. In contrast to her work with Nomura, Shimomura's tracks were quickly approved by Tabata, who only later requested changes or revisions. The score combined multiple music genres: apart from Shimomura's typical classical style, she also incorporated other styles such as Bossa nova and American Blues for certain locations. For his work on the game, Suzuki drew on his work on the Metal Gear series, though he watched gameplay videos rather than cutscenes for his work on Final Fantasy XV. The music was performed and recorded in Boston by the Video Game Orchestra, a North American orchestra specializing in video game music whose first Final Fantasy project had been Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII in 2013. The orchestra's founder Shota Nakama helped with orchestration and arrangements for the soundtrack, in addition to composing the track \\"Bros on the Road\\". Nakama began working on the game in 2014, first working on tracks for promotional trailers. During development, Shimomura discussed her music with the game's other developers so it fit the game's world, along with reading the story. Many of the tracks began as requests from the writers, and for some pieces there was a lot of consultation with staff including director Hajime Tabata while they were being written. Several tracks were meant to emote specific moods. For \\"Luna\\", the theme for the character Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, Shimomura used the character's beauty and strength as inspiration; for the titular theme of main protagonist Noctis Lucis Caelum, she chose to represent the weight of destiny upon him and his inner thoughts, creating a soft piece that portrayed his emotions. The theme \\"Apocalypsis Noctis\\" was intended to be both magnificent and intense, while the track \\"Melancolia\\" was meant to evoke sadness. The music had to include tracks for various times of day due to the game's day-night cycle. Uematsu's \\"Main Theme\\", a recurring theme within the Final Fantasy series, also appeared in an arranged form created by Shimomura and Nakama. Another recurring theme in the series, Uematsu's \\"Chocobo\\" theme, was remixed by Ohta for the tracks \\"Blues de Chocobo\\" and \\"Rodeo de Chocobo\\". Concerning tracks related to times of day and elements such as battle themes, Shimomura allowed the flow of gameplay to dictate the flow of her music, which required putting in a number of natural transition points within pieces so the break would be smooth. To help with this, a special software tool called MAGI (Music API for Gaming Interaction) was developed to manage the tempo and create sync points that allowed the music's flow to be interactive while keeping its \\"epic\\" sound and scope. When the game began development as Versus XIII it used the same sound environment as Final Fantasy XIII, but with the move to new hardware the sound team needed to design a new sound environment. To develop the sound software, the team partnered with CRI Middleware to integrate the company's CRI ADX 2 middleware into the game's native sound environment. The amount of sound data, which also included 300 tracks of standalone music and 150 tracks of environmental music, required for the game was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto the game disc alongside the rest of the game data. =Theme songs= Florence Welch (pictured 2015) sang the game's theme songs, while her band Florence and the Machine performed them. The game's theme song is a cover of Ben E. King's \\"Stand by Me\\", performed by the English indie rock band Florence and the Machine and sung by the band's leader, Florence Welch. It was used in all versions of the game. The cover used a full orchestra, including brass, strings and timpani. In addition, the recurring theme \\"Prelude to Final Fantasy\\" was incorporated as a backing player on the harp. Welch stated that she wanted to make a \\"mystical\\" contribution to the game. She also commented that \\"Stand by Me\\" was a difficult song to improve upon. When deciding upon an artist who had their own unique \\"world\\" that would fit with the setting of XV, Florence and the Machine was one of many bands Square Enix looked at. In the context of XV, \\"Stand by Me\\" was not intended as a love song, but rather as a message or prayer of gratitude from Noctis to all who had supported him on his journey, including Lunafreya, his father Regis and his three companions Gladiolus Amicitia, Ignis Scientia and Prompto Argentum. Welch's contribution is notable as Final Fantasy theme songs have traditionally been performed by Asian singers, with the exception of XIII which had the Leona Lewis single \\"My Hands\\" substituted for \\"Kimi ga Iru Kara\\" in its English release. In addition to the cover for \\"Stand by Me\\", Florence and the Machine created two original songs inspired by the world and story of XV, also sung by Welch: \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\" and \\"I Will Be\\". Not all of the theme songs were used in the base game, with some coming in future content. =Additional media= In addition to Final Fantasy XV, the game received additional media as part of a move to prevent the story spanning multiple games: this project was dubbed the \\"Final Fantasy XV Universe\\", and included Platinum Demo, the CGI feature film Kingsglaive, the original net animation series Brotherhood, and the mobile title Justice Monsters V. The music for Brotherhood was composed by Yasuhisa Inoue and Susumi Akizuki of Righttrack. For Justice Monsters V, the music was composed by a five-member team from the music production company, Unique Note. The music for Kingsglaive was composed by John R. Graham, with additional themes by Shimomura taken from her score for Final Fantasy XV. Suzuki also worked on the Kingsglaive soundtrack. Shimomura also composed the film's main theme. Graham had previously contributed to the score of Square Enix's Bloodmasque and the 2014 film The Forger. For a few of Shimomura's pieces used in the film, the arrangement was altered to make it darker and add scale. Some tracks, such as \\"Battle for the Crown City\\", changed a lot during the score's development based on the scene it was set to within the film. While both orchestral and electronic elements were used in the score, the film's director Takeshi Nozue insisted on keeping the electronic elements to a minimum and fuse those that existed with the score to create a distorted clash of elements. This was due to the story of the film revolving around Lucis' Crystal and the rules surrounding its magic, in addition to the story focusing on the differing reactions of people facing extraordinary circumstances. According to Graham, Nozue wanted a complex musical score. The harmonics and themes change throughout the score to create both an ambiguous atmosphere and a sense of impending tragedy and loss. Graham was brought on board to create a score that would fill the film's world and act as a counterbalance to Shimomura's music from the game, which was incorporated into the overall score. Due to the themes and events of Kingsglaive, Graham needed his music to reflect the weight, contradictions, and shifting \\"light and dark\\" perspectives of the characters and locations. He wrote more than 100 minutes of music. The score was recorded entirely in the United States in Nashville, Tennessee, with the Nashville Music Scoring Orchestra. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Eric Schmidt, and produced by Koyo Sonae. Daniel Kresco handled recording, mixing and engineering. The score was described by Nozue as \\"Shimomura meets Hollywood\\". This effect was reinforced by Graham's work. Graham also contributed to the game's soundtrack, creating arrangements for \\"Song of the Stars\\" and \\"Dawn\\". The original commercial demo Episode Duscae featured music both from earlier trailers and new tracks. The music for Episode Duscae was performed by the Video Game Orchestra. Selected tracks from the game were included in Platinum Demo, a commercial demo that acted as a prequel to Final Fantasy XV. Additional music from across the Final Fantasy series was included for players to listen to on the radio of the party's car Regalia: available tracks ranged from the mainline Final Fantasy games to spin-off titles such as Dissidia Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy Type-0. For the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo trailer, Square Enix collaborated with rap artist Afrojack to create a piece of music that would emulate the trailer's fast-paced action. Working together with editor Hidekazu Kato under the development title \\"Xtream\\", Afrojack was approached as the team wanted a trailer which would stand out at the event. The promotional trailer \\"Omen\\", produced by Digic Pictures based on the world and story of Final Fantasy XV, was set to \\"Endlessness\\", composed by dedicated trailer music company IMAscore. The music was composed by IMAscore's lead composer Andreas Kübler. =Downloadable content= Suzuki acted as main composer for the game's story- based downloadable content (DLC), along with Shibata and Aoki. The music for the Royal Edition, which included both released DLC content and added story sections, was composed by Shimomura and Suzuki. Suzuki and Aoki handled music for Monster of the Deep: Final Fantasy XV. Shimomura was also composing a new theme song for the 2019 DLC series Dawn of the Future prior to its cancellation in late 2018. A regular contributor to the DLC was Tadayoshi Makino, who had previously worked on Dragon's Dogma and Final Fantasy Record Keeper. Keiichi Okabe, the composer for Nier: Automata, was brought on to help with the DLC episode Episode Gladiolus. He worked on the theme song \\"Shield of the King\\" and an arrangement of \\"Battle at the Big Bridge\\", a battle theme associated with recurring character Gilgamesh. When writing \\"Shield of the King\\", Okabe wanted to portray the burden of responsibility and fate Gladiolus bore, which he compared to the burden of character 2B in Nier: Automata. \\"Battle at the Big Bridge\\" was initially going to have minimal work done due to its favored place among fans of the Final Fantasy series, but with encouragement from game staff Okabe arranged the track within his own musical style. To accomplish this, Okabe incorporated vocal elements similar to those used in Nier: Automata. The main theme and selected tracks for Episode Prompto were composed by Naoshi Mizuta, who had previously composed music for Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIII-2. While he had previously been told to compose his themes based on specific scenes within the game or on developer requests, Mizuta was instead given a comprehensive description of Prompto's backstory and life history. Mizuta built up his musical image from there; a central part of the DLC was showing Prompto's more serious side as opposed to his role in the main game as a mood maker. Mizuta was purposely not told what type of sound the team wanted, with them instead waiting to see what ideas he could come up with. For Episode Ignis, three new pieces were composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had worked with Square Enix staff on the music of games including Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross and Xenogears. Additional music was composed by Makino and Tomomichi Takeoka. Mitsuda decided to represent Ignis's character using a single violin, despite the risk of the more bombastic orchestral elements obscuring the violin work. Final Fantasy XV was his first Final Fantasy project. The pieces were performed by the Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra. An additional new track for Episode Ignis, \\"Apocalypsis Magnatus\\", was composed by Shimomura and arranged by Makino. The multiplayer expansion Comrades had its theme song composed by Uematsu. Titled \\"Choosing Hope\\", the theme was sung by Japanese vocalist Emiko Suzuki. When composing the theme, Uematsu drew inspiration from gospel music as he felt the tone would fit into the world's theme. Speaking about the recording session, Uematsu said it was the first time he remembered holding back tears. Additional music was composed by Suzuki, Makino, Tsutomu Narita, and Tomomichi Takeoka and Tai Tomisawa from Makino's company SpinSolfa. Makino contributed new battle themes and a medley of previous character themes to a later expansion of Comrades. The music for Episode Ardyn was co-composed by Kenji Hiramatsu, and anime composer Taku Iwasaki. Iwasaki was requested by scenario director Toru Osanai. Director Takefumi Terada described the main themes of the narrative and gameplay to Iwasaki before work began. The team wanted a modern sound to go with the villainous role of lead character Ardyn Izunia and the urban setting of the DLC episode. Iwasaki also composed the title screen track, which was based on the story's themes. In contrast to Iwasaki's other work, the title theme was dedicated to Aera Mirus Fleuret, a key character in Ardyn's backstory. It was written as the kind of theme Ardyn as a character would never be associated with. Rap sections for the track \\"Conditioned to Hate\\" were performed by Lotus Juice. The rap segments were decided upon in the middle of production, and the team approved them as they felt it was \\"unprecedented\\" within the series. Albums =Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack= The game's official soundtrack album, Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack, released first in Japan on December 21, 2016. The album was produced by Koyo Sonae. The soundtrack came in multiple editions. The standard four-disc CD and one-disc Blu-ray releases featured the entire in-game soundtrack with the exception of \\"Stand by Me\\", coming to ninety tracks of music. A limited edition featured two Blu-ray discs and a CD; the first Blu-ray featured the full game soundtrack, the second Blu-ray disc held the track selection from the party's car radio in addition to Welch's rendition of \\"Stand by Me\\", while the CD featured versions of selected tracks arranged for piano by Yui Morishita and Takuro Iga. The limited edition also had additional contents including behind- the-scenes footage concerning the recording of the soundtrack. The piano arrangements were performed by Yui Morishita, a noted Japanese pianist. Selected tracks were also included in a \\"Special Soundtrack\\" Blu-ray disc released as part of the Final Fantasy XV Ultimate Collector's Edition. The four-disc edition, which includes all available tracks from that version, was released internationally by Sony Classical Records in 2017. This version was released in Europe on February 24, and in North America on March 24. The Blu- ray and CD versions both entered the Oricon charts at #35, remaining in the charts for a further nine weeks. The album was nominated for the 2017 Game Audio Network Guild's \\"Best Original Soundtrack Album\\" award, though it lost to the soundtrack album for Abzû. Samar Farag of RPGFan was highly positive about the album and its mixture of tracks, saying that the shifts in style captured the game's theme of a road trip, with the exception of the track \\"Bros on the Road\\" which he said was \\"more appropriate in Sonic Adventure 2\\". The rest of the album was generally praised, with the last section's dark tones and use of leitmotifs from \\"Somnus\\", the environmental track \\"Valse di Fantastica\\", and the character track \\"Ardyn\\" earning particular praise. Video Game Music Online's Lucas Versantvoort gave the album a score of 3/5; while several tracks stood out as being good, he felt there was a lack of cohesive style present in other recent Final Fantasy scores, feeling that it was a lower-quality example of Shimomura's work than her earlier work on Kingdom Hearts. He also found the other contributors' work mixed, and disliked the mixture of different musical styles. Both reviewers praised \\"Somnus\\" as the album's best track; Farag said he could \\"easily call \\"Somnus\\" one of Shimomura's greatest songs\\", while Versantvoort felt that it was underused in the soundtrack as a whole. =Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack: Volume 2= A second album for CD and Blu-ray, Final Fantasy XV Original Soundtrack: Volume 2, was released on March 21, 2018. The album covers music from post- release DLC and the game's expanded Royal Edition. The five-disc CD release and first disc of the Blu-ray version contain the soundtracks from Episode Gladiolus, Episode Prompto, Episode Ignis, Comrades and the Royal Edition.

The album is also available for download from September 13 to November 29, 2016. It is exclusive to PlayStation Plus subscribers and requires the download of a special mobile application. Chris Greening of Video Game Music Online gave the score a rating of 4/5 stars, saying: \\"Overall, the grand scale of the score was effective. There is no question by the end of the album that the aim of the director – and composer – was to create a grand-scale orchestral epic. While some of the thematic content occasionally gets lost in the bombastic instrumentation, the score itself is heartfelt and authentic, and makes for an enjoyable listen. When compared to Advent Children, the score to Kingsglaive is darker and more cinematic, setting a refreshing precedent for any future Final Fantasy films\\". =Songs from Final Fantasy XV= The three songs by the English group Florence and the Machine, \\"Stand by Me\\", \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\", and \\"I Will Be\\", were released together under the banner title \\"Songs from Final Fantasy XV\\" as digital singles by Island Records on August 12, 2016. In addition to Florence and the Machine, the singles were produced with the help of Emile Haynie and Jeff Bhasker. In their first week of release, \\"Stand by Me\\" and \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\" both charted: \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\" broke the top 100 in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain; \\"Stand by Me\\" only succeeded in charting in the Brazilian charts, reaching #27. \\"I Will Be\\" failed to chart. KT Wong of Video Game Music Online gave the album a perfect score of 5/5 stars. Favorably comparing it to Welch's work on the band's album Ceremonials, he gave each track high praise: he felt \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\" successfully combined Noctis' journey with Welch's signature composition style, praised \\"Stand by Me\\" as a cover that was both respectful and suitable for use with Final Fantasy, and found \\"I Will Be\\" an excellent instrumental track backed up by Welch's vocals. He summed up by calling the album \\"a worthy purchase for all fans of Final Fantasy as well as of Florence and the Machine\\". Patrick Gann of RPGFan called \\"Too Much Is Never Enough\\" his personal favorite from the album, calling it superior to the use of \\"My Hands\\" or the work of Angela Aki. He also praised \\"Stand by Me\\", saying that the version in the \\"Uncovered\\" even trailer did not do the full piece justice. He called \\"I Will Be\\" the type of song it was easy to become absorbed in despite the lack of understandable lyrics. He called the overall album \\"a day-one purchase for [him]\\". =Other releases= A soundtrack album for Justice Monsters V, Justice Monsters V Original Soundtrack, released digitally on September 19, 2016, which consisted of eighteen tracks composed by members of Unique Note.

Despite being a tune from a game which had then been in development for six years, Theatrhythm producer Ichiro Hazama decided to include it as it was a widely known song among the fans by that point, and that its inclusion would add to Theatrhythms purpose as a celebration of the Final Fantasy series for its 25th anniversary. Nomura also approved of the song's inclusion. A live concert was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on September 7, 2016. It featured 12 tracks from the game, and featured a guest appearance by Shimomura.

Description The portrait of Henry Peirse is signed and dated at the base of the balustrade. The work derives from the collection of Sir Henry de la Poer Beresford Peirse, a descendant of the depicted gentleman. The portrait was commissioned by the gentleman during a visit to Rome. The painting was acquired by the state in 1970. Behind Peirse, to the right is the statue of the Ludovisi Ares and to the left, a large decorative urn. At his feet is an architectural fragment, and his pet dog angles for attention. Portrait of John Chetwynd-Talbot Batoni profited from painting a number of such portraits with similar elements for other travelers, including a Portrait of John Chetwynd-Talbot (1773) on display at the J.

Watson (1832 – March 13, 1892) was a druggist, doctor, and civic leader in Detroit, Michigan and Chatham, Ontario. In the late 1850s and early 1860s, Watson was a part of the Detroit-Chatham Underground Railroad and closely connected with William Whipper and George DeBaptiste. During the American Civil War (1861-1865), Watson settled in Detroit, where he would eventually become a city councilman. He was politically independent, and found himself on opposite sides of debates with DeBaptiste and other Michigan blacks, and he switched from the Republican to the Democratic party in the mid-1880s. Early life Samuel C. Watson was born a slave in 1832 in St. James Parish, South Carolina. When he was nine years old, his master died and he was sent with two brothers and two sisters to Washington, DC under the guardianship of Rev. William McLane, a Presbyterian preacher. He had already begun some education, and in Washington, he attended a school led by the wife of abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor, Leonard Grimes. He then attended Union Seminary led by John F. Cook. At the age of sixteen he enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts where he studied for three years, one year in the classical department, before dropping out. The next spring he joined the crew of the survey schooner USS Madison at Brooklyn Navy Yard where he took part in surveys between Delaware Bay and Portland, Maine. The ship returned to New York, and Watson was discharged. He then followed his brothers and moved to Ohio and enrolled at Oberlin College. He again did not finish his studies, opting instead in 1853 to transfer to the Medical Department at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He left that school in 1856, moving to Cleveland, Ohio to finish his studies at the Western Homeopathic College where he graduated in the winter of 1856,Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner.

Similarly, if a designer is forced by space constraints to use a very small cabinet, and they aim to get good, deep low-frequency sound, the sensitivity will be compromised.

Background  Leonardo Esteban appealed a Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) decision that denied entitlement to an increased rating for residuals of an injury to the right side of the face. Mr. Esteban served on active duty between July 1946 and April 1949. In January 1949, he injured his face during a motor vehicle accident in Japan. In 1977, he attended a VA examination. The examination noted that there were four scars on the right side of his face. The report also detailed that there was an injury to the facial muscles and that he was experiencing pain in the area. The Veteran was ultimately granted service connection under diagnostic code 7800 at 10% disabling. In 1988, while in the process of filing a claim for an increased evaluation, the Veteran provided medical evidence that he had paralysis on the right side of his face. BVA denied this claim for an increased evaluation. In June 1991, he filed again and provided medical evidence showing that he had impaired sensation on the side of his face and disfiguring scars. The report also showed that he had difficult with mastication and pain. The VA Regional Office denied a higher evaluation. The Board affirmed this decision, but conceded that the Veteran could be rated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7804 or 5325. However, the Board held that the Veteran was not entitled to multiple evaluations for the same disability. Therefore, the 10% disability was confirmed.  Analysis  The Court rejected the argument by the Board. The Court noted that the rating criteria under diagnostic code 7800 was entirely cosmetic in nature, while the rating criteria under 7804 dealt only with the pain associated with the scarring itself. Additionally, diagnostic code 5325 only dealt with facial muscle damage resulting in difficulty with mastication. Therefore, his symptomatology was distinct and separate, thereby not in violation of 38. C.F.R. §4.14. For these reasons, the Court held that the Veteran was entitled to separate evaluations under all three diagnostic codes, as none of the symptomatology for any one of the three conditions were duplicative or overlapping of the other two conditions.  Decision  The appellant's motion was granted, the BVA decision reversed, and the case was remanded.

Description The 220 mm howitzers were a compromise design for their time, with decent capability to destroy fortifications and yet mobile enough. Constructively, the design shared many features with the 149 mm Skoda Model 1928 Gun. The howitzer used only immobile, fully traversable siege mount which had to be offloaded from the transport platform into a shallow (0.5m deep) pit before firing. Typical preparation time was 3 hours. The Skoda 220 mm howitzer utilized a hydro-pneumatic recoil system. Loading was manual, with separate shell and the bags of the propellant allowing 9 different propelling charges. For transport, the howitzer was disassembled into three loads and each was towed by a separate 8-ton tractor. The maximal towing speed was . History The K-series was an entirely new design by the Škoda Works company of Czechoslovakia. Although the exact development schedule is unknown, the first contract to deliver 12 artillery pieces was signed with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1928. The howitzers were locally designated as M.28. In October 1929, a Polish delegation also evaluated the design. The contract to deliver 27 artillery pieces to Poland was signed in 1933, with actual deliveries happening circa 1934-1935. At least 14 Škoda 220 mm howitzers were captured by German forces from Poland in September 1939 and re-designated 22 cm Mörser 538(p). Also, some howitzers were captured in April 1941 from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and re-designated 22 cm Mörser 538(j). Finally, 7 howitzers were captured by the Soviet Union from Poland and were re-used against Finland during the Winter War. The Army of Czechoslovakia had also considered adopting gun, but the plans were abandoned. The fragmentation (anti-personnel) shell for the howitzer was developed in Poland by June 1939, and at least 60 fragmentation shells were produced under German occupation. =Known German coastal batteries using 22 cm Mörser 538= *Battery 47/977 in Kroken and Hetlefloten, 6 pieces *Battery 6/975 in Klinga, 3 pieces *Battery 4/974 in Reitan, 3 pieces  References  Bibliography * Chamberlain, Peter & Gander, Terry.

Recreated Map of the Benalla Migrant Camp. The Benalla Migrant Camp, formally known as the Benalla Holding Centre and the Benalla Migrant Accommodation Centre, was one of 23 similar camps established by the Australian government to provide temporary housing for non-British new arrivals in post-World War II Australia.Pennay, B. Benalla Migrant Camp: A Difficult Heritage, Benalla Migrant Camp Inc., Benalla, 2015, p.1; Victorian Heritage Database Report, Former Benalla Migrant Camp, 2016, p.3. The Camp occupied the former Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) No.11 Elementary Flying Training School (1941-1944), adjacent to a small aerodrome on the outskirts of Benalla in north east Victoria. Opening in 1949, the Benalla Migrant Camp was a modest-sized holding centre, accommodating 200 – 400 people. It survived national reviews of migrant accommodation needs in 1953 and 1959, but by 1967, the number of residents had diminished sufficiently for the Camp to close. By that time, over 60,000 people — mainly of Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, German and Estonian origins, as well as other nationalities — had been accommodated there.  Benalla Migrant Camp  P-type huts at Benalla Migrant Camp. Migrant family outside a Nissen Hut. (Source: Freda Meiers) Initially, the Benalla Migrant Camp was intended as a ‘holding centre’ to provide short-term accommodation for the dependent families of new arrivals, all of whom had been processed at the larger Bonegilla Migrant Reception Centre. The migrants arrived in Australia as a part of a large-scale immigration programme launched to increase Australia's population, and hence its labour force. Contracted to work in government allocated employment as a condition of their migration, the breadwinners of migrant families were dispatched to various places of employment. If they were unable to find family accommodation close to their work, their dependants were put into a holding centre like Benalla. In this way, the Benalla Camp was initially associated with family separation — a system which received widespread criticism.Pennay, pp.5-6. The Camp also took in supporting mothers and was equipped with child care facilities so the women could work, which was highly unusual for the time. Camp accommodation at Benalla comprised basic ex-military ‘P-type’ corrugated iron huts (initially unlined and without power-points), with separate communal cooking and washing facilities, and other facilities such as a kindergarten, school, hall, hospital, shops and a gymnasium. In the first few years of camp operation, Nissen Huts were also added to the camp to increase capacity. Camp residents received medical checks, and attended courses in English language and the Australian way of life.Pennay, p.5. Generally residents were expected to stay at the Holding Centre between four and six months. Some stayed until they had completed their migration agreement obligations to the Australian Government, which was 2 years’ labour contract. A number stayed much longer — in some instances up to 15 years. Residents were required to pay a tariff for their accommodation. The first years at the Benalla Migrant Camp were the busiest, with a peak occupancy of 1063 migrants in 1951. The number of migrant arrivals decreased markedly when the displaced persons scheme drew to an end in 1952 and a number of holding centres closed. In 1953 a gradual change in policy meant that Benalla ceased to be solely a holding centre taking in only dependants.Pennay, ibid., p.7. In 1958, it had a formal name change to the Benalla Migrant Accommodation Centre. Facilities were improved, and the Camp provided accommodation to breadwinners and their families if the breadwinner worked in the Benalla district and could not find private accommodation.Pennay, p.8. Although the official Camp capacity was 500, throughout the 1950s the resident population at Benalla remained around 400 with an average of 200 people moving in and out each year. By the mid-1960s the occupancy did not exceed 250 with an annual turnover of about 240.Victorian Heritage Database Report, 2016, p.6. In 1967 there were only 135 residents at the Camp, and after a Department of Immigration inquiry found it economically unviable, the Camp was closed that year.Victorian Heritage Database Report, 2016, p.6; Pennay, p.12.  The Benalla Experiment  Migrant women were employed at Latoof and Calill. (Source: Freda Meiers) Migrants were also employed at the Renold Chains factory. The Benalla Holding Centre also fulfilled a distinct role within the national migrant camp system, in that it received supporting mothers with children (at the time, dubbed ‘unsupported mothers’ or ‘widows and unmarried mothers’). As a humanitarian gesture, Australia's immigration scheme had admitted large numbers of supporting mothers at the request of the International Refugee Organisation, to help it empty the Displaced Persons Camps in Europe. At the time, Harold Holt, the Minister for Immigration, explained, ‘It was fully realised that their employment and accommodation would present a problem’.Pennay, B., 'Remembering Benalla Migrant Camp: The reception of supporting mother immigrants in post- war Australia', unpublished paper, Charles Sturt University, 2016, p.1. From late 1951 on, many of these supporting mothers were directed to the Benalla Holding Centre, which was close to two newly built factories (the Latoof and Callil clothing and Renold Chains factories). These factories offered the women employment. The Camp also employed some of the women as cooks, hygiene workers and in administration; while others were employed locally as ‘domestics’. At any one time, about a third of the resident population of the Benalla Migrant Camp was made up of supporting mothers.Pennay, B. Benalla Migrant Camp: A Difficult Heritage, p.8. Initially, what some social workers dubbed the ‘Benalla experiment’ seemed to work well, especially after Camp facilities were improved and adequate childcare for working mothers was provided. Women were given English language training and homemaking classes, to increase their prospects of marriage and assimilation into the wider community. Benalla was intended only as a short term solution for accommodating supporting migrant women, and initially, with the turn-over of 30-50 Camp residents each month, the system seemed satisfactory. However, the jobs open to supporting mothers did not pay enough for them to accumulate sufficient savings to establish their own homes. For most of these women, their best prospects for leaving the Camp lay in marriage or by moving into accommodation with their eldest child once he or she was working and could establish a home; but where these opportunities did not exist, there was a problem.Pennay, ibid., p.10. Living under temporary conditions for long periods was demoralising for both women and children,Pennay, p.11. and yet by 1956, social workers found that Benalla had many ‘long stayers’ who had little prospect of leaving, and some who were even fearful of leaving the protection of the Camp.Pennay, pp.12, 27. As the Camp closed in 1967, a psychiatric social worker, Mrs K. Patterson, was appointed to recommend ways that remaining residents could be ‘absorbed effectively into the community.’Pennay, p.13. One former social worker later recalled that, far from the ‘Benalla experiment’ being a success, ‘Benalla was a sad and tragic camp where widows and single mothers were sent… The morale of the women was low and assimilation into the community poor.’Sluga, G. Bonegilla ‘A Place of No Hope’, Melbourne: University of Melbourne, 1988, p.27.  State Heritage Listing  Today, Hut 11 houses the Benalla Migrant Camp Exhibition. Recreated Migrant Accommodation in Hut 11. On 19 May 2016, the Benalla Migrant Camp was listed as a site of significance at the State level on the Victorian Heritage Register. According to historian Bruce Pennay, two developments led to this listing: ‘first, the compilation of an exhibition by Sabine Smyth; and second, the proposed redevelopment of the airport,’ which potentially threatens the site.Pennay, p.44. In 2012, local resident Sabine (Burczik) Smyth began collecting names, memories, artefacts and photographs relating to the Camp, in order to launch a photographic exhibition for Australia Day 2013 in celebration of that year's theme ‘We Are One’. The Benalla Migrant Camp Exhibition was held in Hut 11, one of the disused camp huts that had subsequently become vacant. The following April, the Benalla Migrant Camp Inc. formed as a volunteer group with the broad aims of continuing the collation of historical material and establishing a permanent memorial exhibition. The exhibition has since remained open to visitors on a regular basis, with Smyth continuing to gather photographs and stories from ex-Camp residents. In January 2014 Smyth (Benalla Migrant Camp Inc.) lodged an application for nomination of the former RAAF Base and Migrant Camp to Heritage Victoria. This was initially rejected but eventually accepted on the 7 March 2014. Independently from this application, Heritage Advisor Deborah Kemp (employed as a consultant by Benalla Rural City) assessed the site's historical significance as part of the Benalla Airport Redevelopment Plan, ahead of the World Gliding Championships to be held on the site in 2017, and found it to be of local, and most likely also state heritage significance. She found that while most of the original Camp has been demolished or sold and removed to make way for the expansion of an aged care facility,Pennay, p.42. nine of the original P-type huts remain, including six buildings still in situ — two toilet blocks and four huts, two of which were school buildings and another which served as the camp chapel and the other most likely the crèche/kindergarten.Pennay, p.45. Additional remaining historic fabric includes concrete gate posts at the intersection of BARC (abbreviation of Benalla Accommodation and Recreation Centre) Avenue with Samaria Road, a remnant below-ground cistern, BARC Avenue itself, and related infrastructure.Victorian Heritage Database Report, 2016, p.3. A petition lodged in 2015, to preserve the remains of the Camp helped prompt Heritage Victoria to undertake a cultural heritage assessment of the site in July 2015.Pennay, p.48. The assessment recommended that the site not be included on the Victorian Heritage Register, partly on the basis that its historical connections with post-WWII migration were ‘more clearly demonstrated at the more extensive and intact camp at Bonegilla (VHR H1835) and at the former Maribyrnong Migrant Hostel (H2190).’Heritage Victoria, Assessment of Cultural Heritage Significance and Executive Director Recommendation to the Heritage Council, Former RAAF Base and Migrant Camp, Samaria Road, Benalla, July 2015, p.4. In February 2016, Heritage Victoria held a Registration Hearing in Benalla to consider this recommendation. The hearing attracted around 100 community members over two days, and took into account eighteen submissions rejecting this recommendation, and in doing so, determined that the site was of heritage significance and should be included on the state Heritage Register (VHR Number H2358). The site was deemed significant on a state level as an example of one of only a small number of surviving post-World War II non- British migrant accommodation centres, and as Victoria's longest-lasting holding centre, which played a distinctive role in settling vulnerable groups of non-British migrants in the post-war years. It was also deemed socially significant for its connection with former residents and their families, and its ability to interpret the experiences of post-World War II non-British migrants to the broader Victorian community.Victorian Heritage Database Report, 2016. Historian Bruce Pennay has described the Benalla Migrant Camp as a site with a ‘difficult heritage’, partly because it does not fit easily into the post-war migrant success stories that form a part of Australia's historical nation-building narratives.Pennay, p.3. ‘All holding centres…’ Pennay contends, ‘raise embarrassing questions about the cruel and discriminatory policy of family separation, forced movement, assimilation, and the adequacy of support services.’Pennay, pp.14-15.

At this time, Kirchner painted several different street scenes that illustrated the chaos of city life and the relationship between men and women. Visual Analysis In Street, Berlin (1913), Kirchner depicts a busy street scene as men and women walk down the sidewalk. Kirchner paints two women in the central foreground and their figures take up a large portion of the canvas, making them the focal point of the piece. The woman on the left wears a purple dress, a pop of color which contrasts with the mostly black clothing of the men that surround the pair. The mass of men in the background do not have any identifying features, but instead appear as a copy of each other. Their clothes flow into one another and their non-distinct facial features cause you to connect with the women because they are the only two with a sense of identity. Kirchner uses some anti-naturalistic color in this piece including the skin of the figures which varies between shades of pink and orange as well as the blue and pink shades in the scenery. The anti-naturalistic tones are common in the German Expressionism and his other work during this time period. Kirchner paints with loose and visible brushwork. The brushwork creates a sense of motion, allowing for an aspect of hustle and bustle to be added to the street scene. The tilting downward of the perspective and the opposing diagonals in the brushwork create distortion and a sense of motion. The viewer feels confronted with the people in the street, as if they about to spill off the canvas and into our space. This stylistic choice also makes you feel closer to the women while farther away from the anonymous male figures in the background. Ideas of expression within German art carry all the way from Grünewald to Kandinsky, and Kirchner builds upon the idea of expressive brushwork and movement in his own pieces. Die Brücke and Personal Struggles Kirchner had been a founding member of the German Expressionist painting group Die Brücke. The artists banded together in 1905 in Dresden and with the goal of promoting an avant- garde artistic style and saw themselves as an avant-garde group that bridged the gap between the classical past and their perception of art of the future. Die Brücke developed \\"a common style characterized by compositions of flat areas of unbroken colour, a radical simplification of form, and the use of glowing, unmixed colours applied with fluidity.\\" The group sought to apply this stylistic approach to painting, printmaking, and architecture, though Kirchner focused almost solely on painting. Kirchner claimed to have artistic independence in the style of his work, but influence from earlier avant-garde movements is visible. The choice of bright and unnaturalistic colors resembles the work of Matisse during his Fauve period, which he also painted a number of figures like Kirchner does. Matisse was known throughout his career for painting female figures, a trend that Kirchner also adopts in his own work. Along with other members of the group, Kirchner moved to Berlin from Dresden in 1911. The move to Berlin proved to be troublesome for the group and rifts began to form. In 1913, several months before Kirchner painted Street, Berlin, the group formally dissolved due to artistic differences and disagreements about the direction of the group. Kirchner held a grandiose attitude to his own artwork and his attitudes toward showing outside the group context were major factors in the group's dissolution.

Since 2004 he has been professor of particle physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Manchester. He is the co-author of 5 books, including the popular science books Why Does E=mc²?, The Quantum Universe and Universal: A guide to the cosmos, co-written with physicist Brian Cox. He has also written over 100 peer reviewed papers published in scientific journals and speaks at international science festivals for children and adults. He frequently acts as science consultant to the BBC and other media and is a columnist for The Observer. Forshaw is a recipient of the Maxwell Medal and Prize for his contribution to particle physics, and the Kelvin Prize from the Institute of Physics for his contribution to the public understanding of physics.Professor Jeff Forshaw at University of Manchester School of Physics and AstronomyAuthor Jeff Forshaw at Observer Science pagesTED Studies: Physics – The Edge of Knowledge Education Forshaw attended Hesketh Fletcher High School and studied A levels at Wigan and Leigh College where he considered his teachers, Jim Breithaupt, Alan Skinner and Jean Wadsworth an important influence on his future career. He went on to study physics at Oriel College, OxfordJeff Forshaw graduating with a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in physics in 1989, followed by a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Manchester in 1992 for research on the parton content of the photon and photon-induced minijets. Career and research From 1992 to 1995 he worked as a postdoctoral research scientist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Didcot in Oxfordshire, in the group led by noted particle physicist Frank Close. While studying he intended to become a school teacher but began lecturing at university level after his PhD. He began his friendship and eventual collaboration with Brian Cox around 1995 when he was Cox's lecturer in Advanced Quantum Field Theory as they were the same age, despite being student and teacher. In 2004 he became professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester School of Physics and Astronomy at the relatively young age of 36. At Manchester he is engaged in experimental and theoretical research in the field of particle physics, with particular interest in the behaviours of particles in high energy colliders as at the ATLAS experiment and Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiments, part of the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator research at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. He has said of his theoretical physics research, He has written over 100 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals, including papers on ordering gluon emissions, quantum field theory and holographic wavefunction of mesons. Forshaw and his frequent co-author Cox have stated the peer review process of science results publishing is important because it ensures that minimum standards are met in the scientific community and gives due attribution to all associates working on the piece who are finalising the presentation of the paper, and blogging research before it is published should be avoided. QED: Question, Explore, Discover conference, 2017 As an educator Forshaw is keen to encourage the idea that basic principles and theories in particle physics should be introduced to children in school in order to encourage understanding of the scientific method and use of evidence-based thinking at a young age. In 2008 he added his voice to the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) campaign against spending cuts to UK physics budgets in a letter to the then Secretary of State at the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, John Denham, which was signed by around 350 prominent physicists from the UK theoretical particle physics community. The letter pointed out the adverse effects the cuts would have, not only to physics research in the UK, but also in discouraging future students of astronomy, particle physics and science in general. When asked whether investment in physics could potentially contribute to the UK economy he pointed out, He also encourages people to see the relevance of quantum physics in everyday life and not purely as an academic discipline, using solar panels and lasers as examples of practical everyday applications. In his many public lectures he has been described as \\"deeply enthusiastic about his subject\\" and \\"entertaining and informative.\\" Forshaw often visits schools and colleges to speak in front of young people about aspects of his work and has appeared on children's television in the UK explaining concepts such as the Higgs boson on BBC television programme Newsround for children aged six to twelve. He is an ambassador for educational charity Potential Plus UK which aims to support the emotional and learning needs of gifted and exceptional children. Forshaw also regularly contributes at SciBar events (literally science in a bar) and Café Scientifique events in the UK. He has supervised several PhD students and postdocs. =Publications and media= Forshaw writes frequent popular science articles explaining complex concepts in physics for the press and magazine publications. He has written on subjects such as matter and antimatter, the Big Bang, the existence of the Higgs boson, quantum computers, supersymmetry, the Planck satellite, dark matter and the technology of nuclear fusion. He has also co-authored a set of physics talks with educational support materials for TED Studies entitled Physics – The Edge of Knowledge which is designed to be used online by teachers and students. It explores the relationship between the laws of nature and quantum physics from subatomic particles to the wider universe. Other popular science publications include: *QCD and the Pomeron is a text book written with Douglas A. Ross (1997) written for theoretical and experimental particle physicists and those in the field of applied mathematics and investigates the pomeron, an object in high energy particle physics. It was described as the \\"First book on the physics of the pomeron, fills a gaping hole in the literature.\\" *Dynamics and Relativity written with Gavin Smith (2009) is an undergraduate level text book on the physics behind classical mechanics and relativity. *Why Does E=mc²? written with Brian Cox (2009) is a popular science book exploring Einstein's Theory of relativity and what it means in relation to topics such as the Big Bang and the Large Hadron Collider. The book received very positive reviews for being easy to read and entertaining, despite dealing with complex physical theories and mathematics, from newspapers such as The Guardian, New York Journal of Books and New Scientist, and was shortlisted for the Royal Society science book prize in 2010. *The Quantum Universe written with Brian Cox (2012) is a popular science book that attempts to explain quantum physics. Economist magazine listed it as one of its 'Books of the Year' for 2011. It received favourable reviews from The Guardian and the Economist while The Daily Telegraph described it as enjoyable but \\"not an easy read,\\" and The Independent found the theoretical sections stodgy. *Universal, a guide to the cosmos written with Brian Cox (2016) explores fundamental questions about the universe and the science of astronomy as it attempts to understand it. Universal was also well received, with the New Scientist listing it as one of their Great Christmas books, describing it, \\"Rarely has a difficult subject been rendered so accessible.\\" The Guardian referred to it as a magnum opus and The Big Issue focussed on the book's encouragement of critical thinking. Universal was featured by Symmetry, the particle physics journal funded by the US Department of Energy and described as a beautiful book which excels on many levels. *Forshaw is series editor of the Manchester Physics Series of textbooks aimed at university undergraduates and postgraduates. Forshaw was science consultant for several BBC Television series and programmes including the following: *The Science of Doctor Who, documentary, 2013 *Wonders of Life series, 2012 *Wonders of the Universe series, 2010 and 2011 *A Night With The Stars, documentary, 2011 *Wonders of the Solar System series, 2009 and 2010 *Horizon:- What on Earth is wrong with Gravity? 2009 *Horizon – Do You Know What Time It Is? 2008 *Naked Science: Time Machine for National Geographic channel, 2008 *Equinox: The Big G, 1998 Of his writing and efforts to bring physics to the wider public he said, =Awards and honours= In 1999 Forshaw was awarded the Maxwell Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics for his outstanding contribution to particle physics. In 2013 Forshaw received the Kelvin Medal from the Institute of Physics for his outstanding contribution to making complex physics accessible and understandable to the public. In 2010 Cox and Forshaw's book Why Does E=mc²? was shortlisted for the Royal Society science book prize. Personal life Forshaw lives in Manchester and has two daughters.

It is about a future in which eggs unlock the secrets of the universe. The player's goal in the game is to make the most profitable egg farm.  Gameplay  alt=The gameplay consists of a red button that can switch sizes and has a chicken on it. When the button is pressed, chickens are released and therefore, money is made from their eggs that they produce. This money can be used to further upgrade the egg farm by doing lab research which increases the value of the eggs, the speed that they are produced, and the size of the player's distribution fleet. To increase the profitability of the farm, the player can construct bigger spaces (called hen houses) to house more chickens, buy bigger trucks to transport more eggs and more grain silos to allow the farm to run by itself for longer periods of time. There is also epic research which is purchased with golden eggs and is permanent (does not reset when the player upgrades their egg or prestiges). This includes decreasing the price of buildings and research and increasing the size of the hatchery. Egg, Inc also allows the player to earn currency by watching advertisement videos. Every few minutes, a white truck will come by and drop off a package containing money (the value of which is scaled up as the farm value increases). When the player's farm has higher income, and the production rate is higher, the player can upgrade to a different egg, restarting, but with each egg selling for a higher base price. Later egg types, trucks, and hen houses are themed as being futuristic. There are also drones which when clicked on will give the player cash. Sometimes, the player may get a few golden eggs instead. Golden eggs are the premium currency; while they can be earned while playing, they can also be bought with real money, and they do not reset when upgrading the egg type or starting over. With the aforementioned currency, the player either buy temporary power-ups, like unlimited chickens when you tap for ten minutes or double revenue for 2 hours, or can get epic research, which is used to upgrade other aspects, such as the chance of getting a rare drone, or increasing the amount of time for double revenue. When the player's farm reaches a certain value based on the egg, the player can upgrade the type of egg their farm sells to one with greater value and start over. There is also an option to \\"prestige\\". This sends the player back to the first egg, losing all cash, but keeping golden eggs and epic research. However, when the player prestiges, the player earns soul eggs which each gives the player a % increase in their farm's earnings.  Reception  Gamezebo gave the game 4 out of 5 stars praising the game as being \\"satisfying to say the least\\", \\"ideal for short or long bursts of gaming\\" and \\"slow burning soon turns into compelling\\" while criticizing it as \\"ultimately a little pointless\\" and being a little plain.

Previously, the building served as a livery stable, and was built to house the Baker Players (operated by George Luis Baker).

Description The painting celebrates a semi-historic event occurring in Rome at the end of the Second Punic War. Rome, stymied in its pursuit of outright victory, and assailed by poor harvests and other misfortunes, had sought the blessings of a new mother goddess (Cibele) by purchasing a venerable sculpture in Phrygia (Asia Minor). However, as narrated in the Fasti by Ovid, the omens became nefarious when the ship porting the statue up the Tiber to Rome became grounded in a sandbar of the river. Claudia Quinta, a Roman Matron, later identified as a Vestal Virgin, prayed to Cibele for prodigious strength, and was able to wrench the boat from its marooned state, and tow the boat to the city, which the new goddess showered with fortune. Such classical conceits were common artistic subjects in the court of Ferrara of this period, where il Garofano worked. The artist is known for painting allegories and classical scenes.

The nutrients are consumed through plant growth, and captured by accumulation of dead plant material in a layer of sediment. STAs were introduced around the Everglades National Park in an effort to reduce nutrient levels in water flowing towards the park. STAs have been estimated to reduce phosphorus levels by about 80%. Description Agricultural and urban runoff water containing excess Phosphorus is channeled through pump stations into shallow marshes that have been planted with a selection of plants with useful characteristics for water purification, like cattails, submerged aquatic plants and algae. These plants species absorb phosphorus, storing it in their roots, stems and leaves. When they die, they decompose creating a sediment layer that continues to absorb and hold decades worth of phosphorus. Water that flows out of the STAs into Everglades National Park has significantly lower levels of phosphorus than it did when it first entered. History of phosphorus in Everglades National Park The Everglades is a delicate ecological system with a naturally low level of existing phosphorus, resulting in a landscape of sawgrass, wet prairies and tree islands that were well adapted to the low nutrient environment. Increasing levels of nutrients such as phosphorus can encourage the growth of invasive species, smothering and crowding out the natives. STAs have been implemented in key positions at the northern edge of the Everglades to help keep phosphorus laden water from reaching the park, but concerns remain that the already elevated phosphorus levels in both Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades Agricultural Area (both heavy contributors to nutrient laden runoff) are so high that phosphorus loads into the park could continue for many decades.

He has made portraits of burlesque performers and drag queens; and street photography in New York City’s Times Square and the Bowery in the mid-1970s, eighteen of which are in the collection of the Museum of the City of New York. Career After two years at the New Division at Nasson College (an experimental college in Springvale, Maine), Bobbé graduated from the State University of New York at Binghamton with a major in sociology in 1970. He then moved into New York City to pursue a career as a musician. He immediately bought his first 35 mm camera, and became obsessed with photography. His band City Lights was part of the CBGB scene in the mid-1970s and was the first such band to sign a recording contract. After signing to Sire Records, the band put out an album and toured. Bobbé photographed the Ramones, Patti Smith, Blondie, and Television among others. During this time he lived downtown below Chinatown in what was then the Fulton Fish Market, and supported himself by driving a taxi. He started to make photographs on the streets of New York City, focusing on seedy Times Square and the down and out men living on the Bowery. After deciding to concentrate upon photography, Bobbé got a full-time job assisting Robert Farber, a fashion and fine art photographer, which he did for two years. In 1980 he went freelance. While working as an assistant, he started his first themed project, \\"Stormy Weather,\\" black and white photos of discarded umbrellas on the streets of Manhattan. He showed them to the photo editor at Popular Photography and this became his first published personal project.Engel, Nancy T. \\"Stormy Weather.\\" Popular Photography, Mar. 1983: 80-83. In the later half of the decade Leland picked up his drum sticks once again and was the drummer in a rock trio called Johnny Jewel with frontman John Berenzy, releasing one album on 3rd Rail Records. During this time he was working mainly as a beauty photographer, but after about 10 years he became disillusioned by the fashion scene and began to integrate his personal work into his commercial portfolio. This involved shooting real people geared to the advertising market with color, motion and blur that was present in his color street photography. Also during this time, Bobbé sought to have more control of his income so he became involved in the then booming business of stock photography, creating images for top agencies such as Getty Images, Corbis and Photonica. He served as president of Stock Artists Alliance from 2003-2004, a large advocacy group of professional stock shooters. He also began to concentrate on shooting real people portraits to get away from the lifestyle photography that he was producing for stock. Influences Bobbé’s inspirations for his photographs come from many places, both internal and external. As with most artists, he is influenced by other artists working both within and outside his discipline – in Bobbé’s case, photographers such as Harry Callahan, Steve Pyke, and Richard Avedon, as well as painters like Mark Rothko and Edward Hopper; he has also alluded to his inspirations coming from other art forms as well as from within himself: “All of my images reflect who I am as a person in some way. I’m still fueled by that state of mind created by listening to certain types of music,\\" and saying in another interview, \\"I am influenced by music and film more than anything. For me it is about a state of mind rather than a specific photographic influence.\\" Bobbés hometown of New York City has also undoubtedly played a major role in his work: “NYC is unlike anywhere else I’ve ever been. I’ve been saying for years that every time I go outside I’m liable to see something unique that captures my attention. Everything here is so accessible. The energy, the mix of people…as a photographer who is fascinated by people I couldn’t ask for anything more.” Projects =Portrait= * Neo-Burlesque (2009–2011) — studio portraits of New York City neo-burlesque performers in stage costume.

Background Russian interest with regard to the Ottoman Empire centered on the Balkan Peninsula region and the Dardanelles in particular. Ottoman control of this straight left the potential, despite past treaties, to cut off a significant portion of Russian trade and access to the Mediterranean Sea. A weakened Ottoman military in the wake of Sultan Mahmud II's reformation of the armed forces and the recent destruction of their navy during the Greek War of Independence gave the Russian military the opportunity to seize control of straight, as well as some additional territory. There is also reason to believe that Tsar Nicholas I desired to further reduce the resurgent Ottoman army. The Balkans were the main focus of Russian attention at this time, but there was a significant interest in the Caucasus as well. Russian aspirations there centered on the creation of a better or more defensible military border with the Ottoman Empire. Though this was not the main objective of this war, the opportunity provided by a weakened Ottoman position in Europe allowed Russian forces the chance to make these goals a reality. Prelude The Russian invasion of Ottoman territory in the Balkans was stalled at the end of 1828 by the fortress of Shumla in modern Bulgaria and other similar garrisons. Some of these forces, however, had been pulled up from the Balkan mountains, leaving the path south open to further Russian incursion. Diebitsch decided to bypass the forts after leaving small forces behind to contain the garrisons. This allowed him to approach Adrianople uncontested, but the journey through the mountains was hard on his army, and they were not in the condition to besiege the city. Rather than show weakness to the enemy, Diebitsch pushed his soldiers onward, hoping to bluff the defenders into believing a fresh Russian army had appeared on their doorstep. Battle In this case, the label \\"battle\\" is misleading as no actual combat took place. The Turkish defenders, surprised and frightened by the appearance of the Russian army at their gates, surrendered without a fight. The Russian bluff paid off and resulted in their occupation of the European capital of the Ottoman Empire. It is possible that there was a reason beyond fear that prompted the bloodless surrender of one of the Ottoman's most important European cities. Many members of the Adrianople garrison were former Janissaries who deserted almost immediately after the Russian forces' appearance. A number of these men were later arrested and killed for planning to instigate an uprising in Constantinople against the Sultan. Aftermath Though the Sultan desired to continue the war, his advisors convinced him to opt for peace following the loss of Adrianople. Turkish envoys arrived in the city on August 17 to begin working on the peace treaty, which was finalized and signed on September 2. The treaty affected Russian and Ottoman territorial holdings in both Europe and the Caucasus. Though there were no large border shifts, the implications for a number of the affected areas were substantial. In the Caucasus, Russia gained a handful of strong points and a small port. All other territory gained there was returned to the Ottomans. The more significant changes took place in the Balkans region with far-reaching implications for some provinces, especially Moldavia and Wallachia, though most of the land conquered by the Russian army, including Adrianople itself, was returned to Ottoman sovereignty. These two regions had previously been governed by the Ottomans with very little in the way of autonomy. After the Treaty of Adrianople, they had some ability to govern themselves and were even considered Russian protectorates despite being nominally labeled Ottoman territory. Serbia was likewise granted more autonomy and more or less freed of Ottoman governance. Additionally, the Balkan forts that had once acted as a first line of defense for the Ottomans along the Danube River were razed, further liberating these areas of Ottoman influence. Russian access to the Dardanelles was also changed significantly. Their commercial ships were now to be granted unlimited access, as would the ships from any other nation trading with Russia. This gave Russia much more of an assurance that their commercial access to the Mediterranean would continue and effectively opened them to trade with all other nations. As a result of the Battle of Adrianople the Ottoman Empire lost control of large portions of its European holdings in all but name, gave up territory in the Caucasus, and lost ability to use the Dardanelles as a bargaining chip. Russia gained influence in the Balkans and assured their ships' access to trade. =Post-treaty fighting= Some Caucasus commanders were not informed of the treaty until several days later due to slow communications, which led to several small skirmishes in the region after the official end of hostilities.

It is located in the Hallertau, the largest continuous hop-planting area in the world, in the German state of Bavaria. The institute is run by the German Hop Research Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Hopfenforschung) and the Bavarian state. History The Hop Research Society was founded in 1926 in response to an endemic of downy mildew in Germany. It was endowed with a land grant of 71 Ha in Hüll for the conduction of hop breeding experiments to generate mildew-resistant hop cultivars. In 1962, a research institute was built on the site. Originally named the Hans-Pfülf-Institut after the then president of the German Brewers Federation, it was later renamed to the current Hopfenforschungszentrum Hüll. Under its first research director, Hugo Hampp (from 1926 to 1944), the institute focussed on countering the Peronosporaceae infections of the hop plants, which were causing downy mildew, primarily by means of pesticides. Hampp's successor, Friedrich Zattler (from 1944 to 1970), shifted the focus towards breeding of mildew-resistant hop varieties. This resulted in the new varieties Hüller Anfang (1962), Hüller Aroma (1962), Hüller Fortschritt (1964), Hüller Bitterer (1970), and Hallertauer Gold (1974). The Hop Research Center's third director, Johann Maier (from 1971 to 1973), expanded the field of research to hop chemistry and hop oils. Under his presidency, the Bavarian ministry of agriculture joined the Hop Research Society, and the Hop Research Center became a subsidiary of the Bavarian state. Today, the institute is run in public–private partnership between the Hop Research Society and the Bavarian state. Hop varieties In addition to the above-mentioned mildew-resistant hop varieties, the institute developed a number of aroma hop varieties, including Hallertauer Tradition (1991), Opal, Perle, Saphir, Spalter Select, and Smaragd, as well as the high alpha varieties Hallertauer Magnum (1980), Hallertauer Merkur, Hallertauer Taurus, and Herkules (2005). In response to the global craft beer movement, the institute developed several \\"special flavor hops\\": Hallertau Blanc, Huell Melon, Mandarina Bavaria, and Polaris were released in 2012, and Ariana and Callista were released in 2016.

He belonged to the Banu 'Amir's preeminent household, the Ja'far ibn Kilab. He succeeded his father as head of the tribe in its wars with the Khath'am tribe until his injuries and battlefield setbacks forced him to step down. He was reinstated as leader following the death of his uncle Abu Bara. Life 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl belonged to the Malik ibn Ja'far family, the younger line of the Ja'far clan of the Banu Kilab, itself part of the larger tribe of Banu 'Amir.Caskel, p. 442. During the 590s and into the early 7th century, he participated in numerous raids by the Banu 'Amir, sometimes leading his own band. He took over military leadership of the tribe after his father al-Tufayl ibn Malik was slain in combat against the Khath'am in south Arabia. After losing an eye in a battle against the Khath'am at Fayf al-Rih, he was considered unsuitable to command the Banu 'Amir. Moreover, he lost eight or nine close relatives during these engagements, while the Banu 'Amir also suffered significant losses. 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl was held responsible for these losses by other elders of the tribe and a legal struggle ensued for leadership between him and Alqama ibn Ulatha ibn 'Awf, the head of the Ja'far's clan eldest line, the Rabi'a. Arbitration did not result in a conclusive decision, but 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl nonetheless regained his good repute during the suit, partially due to the support of the poet al-A'sha. This proved essential to his reinstatement as leader of the Ja'far clan, and by extension the Banu 'Amir, when his uncle 'Amir Abu Bara ibn Malik died in 624/25. According to Islamic tradition, 'Amir was the worst Bedouin enemy of the prophet Muhammad and violated the protection covenant established between Muhammad and Abu Bara by leading an expedition of Sulaymi tribesmen that massacred dozens of Muslim missionaries at Bi'r Ma'una. He is also said to have plotted the assassination of Muhammad. While these events are ascribed to tradition, it is known that 'Amir died a pagan, having never converted to Islam. Poetry Fragments of 'Amir ibn al-Tufayl's poetry has been collected into a diwan (volume). The English translation is found in The Dīwāns of 'Abīd ibn al-Abraṣ of Asad and 'Āmir ibn aṭ-Ṭufail of 'Āmir ibn Ṣa'ṣa'ah, ed. CJ Lyall (1913 and 1980).Montgomery, p. 77, n. 133.

Allen is known for her urban landscapes and, in particular, scenes depicting post-war rebuilding in London. Biography Allen was born in the Chiswick area of London and, due to a prolonged childhood illness, was home-schooled until she was 14 years old, when she attended Bromley Country School for Girls between 1920 and 1924. Eventually she enrolled in the Royal College of Art. Upon graduating from the RCA in 1928, Allen taught art in a number of schools in London and the Midlands before spending time painting murals in Kent and Warwickshire. In 1936 she returned to London to set up a studio in Fetter Lane and to study at the Slade School of Art. During World War II, Allen lived in London and as well as teaching art, spent one day a week sketching scenes in factories undertaking work for the war effort. Most of her war pieces, and her earlier work, was lost when her studio was destroyed in the Blitz. The War Artists' Advisory Committee purchased one of her surviving watercolours entitled Tacking Boots which is now in the Imperial War Museum. The work depicts a woman in a black dress behind a tacking machine, working on a black boot. In October 1959 her work was featured in the Some Women Artists Exhibition at the Imperial War Museum. From 1938 until 1948 Allen served as a committee member and exhibition secretary of the Artists' International Association. After the war, Allen was appointed as a senior lecturer at Goldsmiths' College and worked there until 1966 when she retired from the post of principal lecturer and head of art and design to concentrate on painting full-time. In 1954, Allen was elected a member of the Worshipful Company of Painters and Stainers. Allen's work is part of a number of public collections, including the Museum of London, University of Liverpool, Leamington Spa Art Gallery and Museum, Morley College, and Goldsmiths, University of London.

Its core purpose is to teach coding in two widely used languages, Python and JavaScript, through music composing and remixing. This learning environment was developed first at Georgia Institute of Technology (from 2011) under Prof. Jason Freeman (School of Music) and Prof. Brian Magerko (School of Literature, Media, and Communication). EarSketch is web-based, which means users can access it with their web-browsers, and with no installation. No account is required to create projects or view existing projects. EarSketch comprises different elements: a curriculum, a digital audio workstation (or DAW), a code editor and console, and a sound browser. EarSketch's sound library was created by Young Guru, Jay Z's sound engineer, and famous sound designer Richard Devine.  Purpose  EarSketch has two main goals: to make computer science more engaging for students, and to diversify the population of students interested in computer science. = Engagement in computer science at school = The US has a shortage of computer science students, not only because not all schools are offering CS classes, but also because students do not enroll in such classes. A study published in 2009 states: \\"The percentage of U.S. high school students taking STEM courses has increased over the last 20 years across all STEM disciplines except computer science where it dropped from 25% to 19%\\".http://www.exploringcs.org/resources/cs-statistics, consulted in November 2016 Considering this, and the fact that all fields of the economy incorporate computing in their operations, EarSketch proposes to motivate students to enroll in CS classes and to pursue CS studies in higher education. EarSketch attempts to reach this goal by adding a musical side to coding. This strategy is a STEAMs approach to education that integrates arts into STEM teaching. A study conducted at Georgia Tech showed statistically significant results in this domain: students who study with EarSketch have been shown to make progress both in content knowledge and attitude towards CS (self-confidence, motivation, intent to persist, etc.).Magerko, B., Freeman, J., McKlin, T., Reilly, M., Livingston, E., Mccoid, S., Crews-Brown, A.

IEEE. partly because of the focus on popular genres of music such as dubstep, and because EarSketch provides a creative, expressive, and authentic environment (since students compose their own music).  History  = Origin of the name EarSketch = The name EarSketch originated in a different project from co- creators Freeman and Magerko focused on collaborative composition and music analysis via drawing. That project never came to fruition, but the idea of collaborative music-making (and the name) remained in a new project focused more on coding and computer science education. Though sketching is no longer a focus of EarSketch, the environment does offer drawing and animation features through P5. = First version: Reaper-based desktop application = The initial version of EarSketch, released in 2012, was built inside of REAPER, a commercial digital audio workstation with extensive support for coding via the ReaScript API for Python and the JavaScript plugin authoring architecture. As the project grew, the Reaper-based version of EarSketch was eventually retired due to its dependence on commercial software, the inability of the team to create an integrated user interface to author code, view musical results in the DAW, find sounds, and challenges installing the software in school computer labs. = Current version: web application = The project then evolved to become a website in 2014. This allowed students to start coding without having to download software. The website uses the web audio API and runs on a private server. New versions are release approximately once per month. EarSketch is not just a software: the EarSketch team works hand in hand with teachers to build the curriculum, and trains teachers every year in summer professional development workshops. = Funding = EarSketch received funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) (CNS #1138469, DRL #1417835, DUE #1504293, and DRL #1612644), the Scott Hudgens Family Foundation, the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, and the Google Inc. Fund of Tides Foundation.  Sections  EarSketch is a web application, and when opening a session, users see different sections: the curriculum, the code editor, the console, the Digital Audio Workstation, and the browser. EarSketch sections = The curriculum = The curriculum is aligned with AP Computer Science Principles but can be used in any introductory programming course. Each chapter has several sections, a summary, a quiz, screencasts, and associated slides. The curriculum is positioned in the right side of the window. It is a textbook for EarSketch that includes chapters about major computing principles, Python and JavaScript, as well as an introduction to computer science. The curriculum is divided in the following sections: * 3 units, namely: ** Unit 1 is an introduction to EarSketch, computing and to basic musical concepts (tempo and pitch, effects...), ** Unit 2 focuses on loops, string operations, musical form and beat, ** Unit 3 introduces conditionals, data structures, and randomness, * Optional more in-depth chapters, * The API documentation, which describes all the functions that are specific to EarSketch, * A university-level introduction to computer science section, * Teacher materials, which include lesson plans, examples, slides, and evaluation tools. * An Hour of code tutorial: Hour of code is a worldwide initiative to engage students in computer science, by providing 60 minute-long ludic introduction tutorials (for instance with Minecraft or frozen components).https://code.org/learn, consulted in November 2016 This particular tutorial is an introduction to computer science where students compose their first song with EarSketch. The units are divided into chapters. Each chapter has several sections, a summary, a quiz, and associated slides. The curriculum contains Python and JavaScript example code that can be pasted into the code editor. = The code editor and console = EarSketch's code editor is located in the window at the center of the page. When the code is executed, it will create the music in the Digital Audio Workstation. If there is an error in the code, a message explaining the error will appear in the console, located under the code editor. = The digital audio workstation = A digital audio workstation (DAW) is a tool used by a majority of music producers which helps manipulate audio samples (or audio files), add effects, and accomplish other tasks in the composition process. EarSketch's DAW is located in the top center section, above the code editor. It contains tracks: each line is a track, and corresponds to an instrument. With code commands, the user will add sound samples in these tracks, as well as effects, such as volume changes, reverberation, delay, etc. When the code is executed, the DAW will be filled with the sound samples, and the user can play the music they just coded. = The browser: scripts and sounds = In order to compose music, EarSketch coders can use samples. Audio samples are located in the sound browser, in the left window, which allows for sound file search, and personal sound file upload. In the left section, users can also show the script browser. A script is a code file, and different scripts will create different music in the DAW.  Main feature examples  Although the code written in the code editor will be either in Python or JavaScript, there are EarSketch-specific functions that allow for the user to accomplish music related tasks. Here are some examples: * One of the basic functions of EarSketch is fitMedia(), which places a sample sound in the Digital Audio Workstation. * Another important function is MakeBeat(), that takes as input a string and a file name. The string corresponds to times when the file should be played, sustained, or when there should be silence. This is a common way of creating percussive lines in music programming languages. For instance, in EarSketch, '0' indicates that the file should play, then '-' means a silence, and '+' means keep playing the sample. So if we use the string \\"0-000+++\\", it means play the audio file on the first sixteenth note, then there is a silence, then the file is played three times in a row, and finally, the file keeps playing through the three last sixteenth notes. * Another example would be setEffect(), which adds effects to a track. Effects are common in Digital Audio Workstations as they are an indispensable element of music production. Here are some examples of effects: ** Volume: this modifies the loudness of a track. It can be used to emphasize a particular track compared to the rest of the instruments. It can also be used to fade in and fade out the music to have a smoother beginning and end. ** Reverb: this makes the samples sound like they were being played in a room that echoes the sounds. ** Delay: this produces an artificial echo. ** Frequency filters: these will modify the sound by either attenuating or highlighting certain frequencies.

She was the first woman in Virginia to publish a volume of poetry entirely her own. Early years Little is known of Lomax's early life save that she was a member of a prominent Virginia family, the daughter of Thomas and Anne Lomax of Portobago, and lived on her father's plantation until his death in 1816. Her mother was a member of the prominent Tayloe family. Career Judith suffered a financial reverse in 1815 which led to her estrangement from a number of her relatives. She spent much of the last fourteen years of her life supporting herself while living in Port Royal, Virginia. Poor health led her to move, in 1827, to live with a sister in Fredericksburg, where she died early the following year and where she was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Episcopal Church. Lomax never married. She is said to have preferred the company of Methodists and Baptists to that of her fellow Anglicans; her own personal faith mixed elements of the three denominations, though she remained a self-described member of the Anglican communion. She supported the activities of the American Colonization Society. She often led services in her own home, and frequently attended funerals, even if the deceased was poorly known to her, as she felt that such attendance sharpened and focused her own faith; she kept up a correspondence with missionaries in Africa, and read religious tracts in French. Ecumenically, she expressed her hope that eventually all Christians would be united under one all-encompassing church without denominations. Beginning in 1819 Lomax kept a notebook of religious writings which traces her efforts, and those of her sister, to aid in the rebuilding of the Episcopal Church in Virginia after the American Revolutionary War. The book indicates that she was of evangelical bent, and illustrates both her piety and her beliefs. She viewed it as a tool of evangelization, sharing it with young divinity students and others to whom she felt it might be of some use; she viewed her writing, both of letters and of her journal, as an important way to practice her own faith. The book was published in 1999 as The Sabbath Journal of Judith Lomax. As a poet, Lomax is known to have exchanged lines with fellow poet Margaret Lowther Page, the wife of Governor and U.S. Representative John Page; the couple were her aunt and uncle by marriage. She was a self-declared admirer of the works of Ossian. Her book of verse, Notes of an American Lyre, was published in Richmond, Virginia in 1813, with a dedication to Thomas Jefferson. She is known to have visited Jefferson, a former acquaintance of her father's, at Monticello and written verse about the house during her career. Eleven of her poems were sent by her father to St. George Tucker for criticism; they are today held in the special collections library of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg.

It was built for Commodore Elbridge Thomas Gerry, a grandson of statesman Elbridge Gerry. History Elbridge Thomas Gerry (1837–1927) hired architect Richard Morris Hunt to design a French Renaissance chateau. Gerry specifically told Hunt that he needed space to house his collection of 30,000 law books. Plans for the house were formally announced in The New York Times on May 15, 1892. Construction began by 1895, and after a reported $3,000,000 in construction costs, the residence was opened officially in 1897.

Led by dancer/choreographer Melaku Belay, they operate a venue, tour, record, and perform under the name Fendika. History The Ex in 2008 Born in 1980 in Ethiopia, Melaku Belay lived as an orphan on the streets of Addis Ababa. As a child Belay earned a living shining shoes and taught himself to dance through participation in folk traditions and religious festivals. He worked for seven years as a dancer for tips in Addis Ababa's Kazanchis neighborhood at a local azmari bet—a tavern that hosts azmari story-songsters who accompany themselves on the masenko (a one-stringed violin) or krar (a type of lyre). Each night after work, the young Melaku slept under the bar and eventually saved enough money to buy the club, Fendika Azmari Bet, from its owners. When not working at the azmari bet, Melaku traveled extensively through Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, and South Sudan to learn as many dances as he could from more than 80 tribes around the Horn of Africa, including the traditions of Gurage, Wolaita, Tigray, Wollo, Konso, Gonder, and Gojam, as well as dances from Somali and Afar regions. Melaku also became a nationally celebrated artist in eskesta, a shoulder dance style whose movements share roots with hip hop's traditions of locking and popping. With Ethiopia's capital city being a nexus of culture, music, and dance from other nations, Melaku incorporated these into his repertoire as well, gradually assembling a 13-piece ensemble called the Ethiocolor Cultural Band. Combining tribal dances and folk instruments with jazz, rock, theater and elaborate costumes. The group became a staple at Fendika, rooted in the azmari tradition but with amplified versions of its instruments. In 2009 Melaku assembled a smaller group out of the larger Ethiocolor ensemble, featuring three musicians, two dancers, and one singer. With a more portable acoustic sound and azmari folk aesthetic, the group named themselves Fendika in tribute to the establishment from which they originated. Fendika performing with Debo Band in 2010 Through the Fendika venue's hosting touring artists from all over the world, the ensemble has established an international network enabling them to travel and collaborate with musicians from around the globe. They have toured the United States and eastern Africa with Boston-area Ethio-jazz orchestra Debo Band, and in 2010 the two groups released a joint live recording from a concert given at the Sauti za Busara African music festival in Zanzibar. Fendika has also toured throughout Europe with Dutch post-punk band The Ex and released records through the band's label. In 2018 Fendika toured Scandinavia in collaboration with Paal Nilssen-Love's free jazz orchestra Large Unit before embarking on their first U.S. solo tour, performing as headliners to Ethiopia Fest Chicago and Boston's Global Music Fest. In their home city of Addis Ababa, Fendika have collaborated with many of their nation's most well-known musicians, including singer Mahmoud Ahmed, begena player Alemu Aga, and saxophonist Getatchew Mekuria. Educational work Fendika musicians at PhilaMOCA in 2018. Fendika often leads workshops in traditional Ethiopian music and dance. The group also supports a school for migrant children which aims to prevent youth homelessness and child labor by providing cultural education for these children and their families. At the azmari bet, Belay supports a dozen young azmaris with room and board plus stipends to support their work. Fendika has also collaborated with members of The Ex, Instant Composers Pool, and others to bring electronic, punk, and improvised music education to Ethiopia. Awards and tributes In 2011 Melaku Belay won the Alliance Ethio-Francaise award for dance excellence and in 2015 was named Chevalier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. In 2011 Los Angeles rock group the Red Hot Chili Peppers released the song \\"Ethiopia\\" for their album I'm with You based on band members' time spent at Fendika.

The painting depicts the Mystical marriage of Saint Catherine, a vision of a chaste union with Jesus, in which the saint has forsaken terrestrial marriage in order to live a consecrated life. Jesus is depicted as an infant or child in the ceremony. The mystical marriage of St Catherine was echoed in the sacrament of consecration of nuns into a religious order.

The building is located at the corner of Pakenham and Collie Streets in the west end conservation area of the city. Description Funeral cortege of Thomas Edwards, who was killed in the 1919 Fremantle Wharf riot Fremantle Trades Hall from Collie Street Fremantle Trades Hall The two storey building was originally tuck pointed, is now painted and was designed in the Federation Free Classical style of architecture. It was constructed using flemish bond brick and has a corrugated iron roof. The ground floor at the centre of the façade is a frontispiece projection acting as an entryway supported by pillars which both have stone plaques and archivolt front and sides. Atop the second floor is a decorative parapet featuring a symmetrical pediment with an \\"888\\" decorative motif. Above the timber framed windows is a string course that joins the stucco arches. The entire building is set back slightly diagonally from the street and pavement. The \\"888\\" motif on the façade pediment means \\"8 hours work, 8 hours leisure and 8 hours sleep\\", which was a core belief of the union movement. History In 1900 a delegation of about 30 trade union officials representing the engineers, lumpers, railway workers, carpenters, engine drivers and boiler makers accompanied by local members of Parliament Alfred Kidson, John Higham, Elias Solomon, Joseph John Holmes and Denis Doherty met with Premier John Forrest to discuss the Government providing a site for a hall, or, if no site were available, providing a monetary grant for the purchase of one. Three sites were inspected later the same month including the current site, which was the site of the Government Analysts, and Stock Inspectors offices, at the corners of the Esplanade, Collie, Packenham, and Henry Streets. The site was granted by the Government to the labour bodies of Fremantle for use as a Trades Hall. The ground was also known as the Old Customs House site. The foundation stone was laid on 26 March 1901 by John Forrest. Also in attendance were F. Gates, the chairman of the building committee and J.J. Cooke, the committee secretary, who presented Forrest with a silver trowel and a jarrah mallet, the former bearing the inscription: The building was opened on 23 January 1904 before a large crowd in a ceremony led by the mayor of North Fremantle, E. Gilleland. The newly elected member for Fremantle, William Carpenter, unveiled both the existing foundation stone and a newly laid stone commemorating the victory of the Labour Party at the last federal election. The building had been constructed at a cost of £2,564, but by the time all extras were paid it would be found that the building would cost closer to £3,000. It had been built using entirely union labour. An opening ceremony was held on 4 March 1904 in the form of a smoke social. Over two hundred guests were at the ceremony including the premier, Walter James. The building was then used as the headquarters for the Fremantle Labour and Trade Union movement, particularly the 50 maritime and other unions associated with the Fremantle Port, until the 1960s. By 1962 the building stood empty and was eventually sold by auction in 1968 for 21,000. It was later used as a theatre named the Old Trades Music Hall and in 1974 became a restaurant. The Rajneesh movement acquired the lease in 1981 and opened a restaurant Zorba the Buddha. By 1992 it was being used as a convention centre by the Esplanade Hotel.

History  The Military Security Shield Forces were formed in January 2016 as a distinct paramilitary unit for the Military Intelligence Directorate's branch 223 of Latakia Governorate, probably in an attempt to further the latter's influence and to compensate for the widespread manpower shortages from which the government suffers since the civil war's beginning. The new unit's first major engagement occurred during the 2015–16 Latakia offensive aiming at driving rebel forces completely from the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range. In March 2016, the militia deployed its forces to eastern Homs Governorate to participate in the government offensive to recapture Palmyra from ISIL. After the city's reconquest, some Military Shield fighters went on to post images of them posing with the severed head of an ISIL fighter. Most of the militia remained in the area around Palmyra for the remaining summer, though some of its fighters joined the Ithriyah-Raqqa offensive in June, which was ultimately a failure. Since July 2016, the Military Security Shield Forces became very active in northern Latakia, helping to repel a local rebel offensive, and thereafter assisting in holding the local frontline, thereby cooperating closely with another new pro-government militia, Saraya al-Areen. Meanwhile, the Military Security Shield Forces also joined a major government campaign to encircle the rebel-held parts of Aleppo. In course of the fighting at Aleppo, the local Military Shield fighters under Mudar Makhlouf began to coordinate their operations with the Syrian Resistance and the Republican Guard- affiliated Popular Security and Support Forces. Soon after, one Military Shield contingent under Hassan Mahfoudh was also sent to Hama Governorate to bolster the local defences against a large-scale Jihadist-led rebel offensive. Notably, the militia also joined Operation Dawn of Victory that saw the fall of the rebel strongholds in Aleppo, and therefore the end of the four-year- long battle for the city. In course of this offensive, images emerged that showed the group being advised by Russian military personnel. Military Shield militiamen on patrol in eastern Syria, September 2017. A Military Shield detachment was present at the Palmyra frontline in December 2016, when ISIL launched a large-scale offensive in the area. This unit was later accused by the Tiger Forces to have fled in disarray after the first serious Islamist attacks, leaving Palmyra and Tadmor's remaining pro-government defenders to their fate. Soon after, Palmyra fell to ISIL, and the Military Security Shield Forces were among the pro-government units that sent reinforcements to help defend the nearby Tiyas Military Airbase from the next Islamist attack. The unit was also involved in the following government counter-offensive in the area. On 23 February 2017, al-Masdar News reported that over 900 Syrian Marines had joined the Military Security Shield Forces in order to avoid being drafted into the regular army. In June 2017, the Military Shield Forces took part in an anti-ISIL offensive in eastern Hama. Later that year, the militia took part in the battle to retake all of Deir ez-Zor city from ISIL. Afterwards, Military Shield militiamen began to garrison towns in eastern Syria which had been retaken from ISIL, such as Mayadin. The pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights accused the militia of requisitioning food from local civilians during this time. As the civil war increasingly turned in favor of the Syrian government, the latter began to gradually demobilize various loyalist militias. The Military Security Shield Forces were among those units that were scheduled in June 2018 to be eventually disbanded.  Organization  Military Security Shield Forces have been accused of being financed by Syrian Sunni businessman Samer Foz, and of acting as the latter's private army. =Notable commanders= The Military Security Shield Forces have several commanders, two of whom are particularly notable: *Abu Ismail, nicknamed \\"al-Khal\\" (\\"The Uncle\\") is from Qardaha, home village of the Al- Assad family, and was a companion of the famous Republican Guard commander Ali Khazzam, who was killed in 2012. Abu Ismail is a veteran of battles in Aleppo, Latakia, Idlib, Hama, Damascus and Daraa, and reportedly also leads several other units besides the Military Security Shield Forces, among them the Martyr Ali Khazzam Battalion of the Republican Guard. He commanded the Military Shield troops that were involved in the Palmyra offensive in March 2016, and was among the militiamen who posed with a killed ISIL fighter. *Mudar Makhlouf is a long-standing Military Intelligence commander and personal acquaintance of Issam Zahreddine. Before joining the Military Security Shield Forces, he won some renown leading several Military Intelligence units in Deir ez-Zor against ISIL in 2014 and 2015.

It is a Grade II listed building. History In the early 20th century Watford Urban District Council operated from municipal offices at Upton House in The Parade. The council sought a proper town hall after it achieved municipal borough status in 1922. The site proposed for the new building in Rickmansworth Road had previously been occupied by an old mansion known as \\"The Elms\\". The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Rigby Taylor, the Mayor, in 1938. The new building, which was designed by Charles Cowles-Voysey in the Neo-Georgian style, was completed in 1939. It was officially opened by the Countess of Clarendon on 5 January 1940. The facility also included a large public venue at the south west end of the complex initially known as \\"Watford Town Hall Assembly Rooms\\" but now referred to as the Watford Colosseum. During the Second World War, William Joyce, who as Lord Haw-Haw broadcast Nazi propaganda from Germany to the UK, criticised Watford Borough Council for the fact that the town hall clock was always two minutes slow. Meanwhile British military forces carried out defensive exercises in case German invading forces ever stormed the town hall. In 1971 the Watford Peace Memorial, which had originally been constructed outside the Peace Memorial Hospital, was moved to a location on the Parade just outside the building. The town hall remains the headquarters of Watford Borough Council which, in August 2019, initiated a consultation on a rejuventation plan which could see the area around the town hall being turned into a \\"cultural hub\\" and the town hall itself being converted into a hotel. The council indicated that, while the rest of the building might be redeveloped, the council chamber and committee rooms would be kept in their current use.

Biography  Abram was the son of a doctor, Vladimir Borisovich Pinkenson, and his wife, Feni Moiseevna. His family had a long background in medicine, and one of his ancestors was the first physician of the Bălți district hospital at its inception in 1882. At a young age, Abram learned to play the violin, and when he was five years old, a local newspaper described him as a violin prodigy. In 1941, Vladimir Pinkenson was assigned to a military hospital in Ust-Labinsk in the USSR. In the summer of 1942, after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the town of Ust-Labinsk was overrun by invading German troops, and there was no time to evacuate the hospital. Soon afterwards, Pinkenson and his family – who were Jewish – were arrested. In November 1942, they were taken to the banks of the river Kuban to be executed. While waiting to be lined up for execution, Abram began to play The Internationale on his violin. He was promptly shot to death by a German soldier. After the end of World War II, Abram Pinkenson became widely known through articles in the Soviet press and radio. In particular, an article describing his deeds and heroic death was published in the newspaper Pravda in 1945. It was picked up not only in many parts of the Soviet Union, but also in Europe and America. At the place of the execution of the young violinist, an obelisk was erected. It was replaced by a concrete monument in the late 1970s.  Commemoration  Concrete monument to Abram Pinkenson in Ust-Labinsk. * Writer Saul N. Itskovich (1934-1988) wrote a book about Pinkenson entitled «Расстрелянная скрипка» (\\"Shot Violinist\\"). * The book «Муся Пинкензон (о пионере-герое)» (\\"Musya Pinkenson (Pioneer-Hero)\\") was published by Soviet publisher Маlysh in 1967. Subsequently, this book has been translated into several languages. * The Pioneer squad of Ust-Labinsk School № 1 was named after Musya Pinkenson.In the 2000s, the school itself was renamed in honor of Alexander Suvorov.

The tramway was not built and with the locomotives considered unsuitable for railway use, they were stored. Per Queensland Railway's classification system they were designated the 6D11½ class, 6D representing they were a tank locomotive with six wheels, and the 11½ the cylinder diameter in inches. In 1884 one was assembled at North Ipswich Railway Workshops and operated a trial from Ipswich to Brisbane. This confirmed its unsuitability for main line use, and it was instead employed as a shunter in Ipswich and South Brisbane. The other two were assembled and despatched to Maryborough in 1888.

People who participate in making often call themselves \\"makers\\" of the maker movement and develop their projects in makerspaces, or development studios which emphasize prototyping and the repurposing of found objects in service of creating new inventions or innovations. Culturally, makerspaces, both inside and outside of schools, are associated with collaboration and the free flow of ideas. In schools, maker education stresses the importance of learner-driven experience, interdisciplinary learning, peer-to-peer teaching, iteration, and the notion of \\"failing forward\\", or the idea that mistake-based learning is crucial to the learning process and eventual success of a project.  Influences  Maker education is an offshoot of the maker movement, which Time magazine described as \\"the umbrella term for independent innovators, designers and tinkerers. A convergence of computer hackers and traditional artisans, the niche is established enough to have its own magazine, Make, as well as hands-on Maker Faires that are catnip for DIYers who used to toil in solitude\\". Dale Dougherty, founder of the Maker Faire and Make magazine, stated in his 2011 TED Talk that \\"We are all makers. We are born makers. We don't just live, but we make.\\" In the same TED Talk, Dougherty also called for making to be embraced in education, as students are the new generation of makers. Another central contributor to the maker movement, Chris Anderson, who was once the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and is now the CEO of 3D Robotics, wrote a manifesto of the maker movement in 2012, called \\"Makers\\". His third book, Makers: The New Industrial Revolution (2012), emphasizes the role that making has to play in the renaissance of American manufacturing. Mark Hatch, formerly the CEO of TechShop, also published \\"The Maker Movement Manifesto\\". In addition to these contributions, seminal texts include, Invent To Learn: Making, Tinkering, and Engineering in the Classroom by Sylvia Libow Martinez, and The Art of Tinkering, by Karen Wilkinson and Mike Petrich, founders of The Tinkering Studio at the Exploratorium. In the United States, hands-on learning through making has roots in the nineteenth century, as a result of the influence of educators such as Calvin M. Woodward, who established the Manual Training School of Washington University on June 6, 1879. Unlike later vocational education that would take hold in 1917 through the Smith-Hughes Act that had the aim of reducing the United States reliance on foreign trade, the impetus for the Manual Training School was to provide students with training in making and craftsmanship that had \\"no immediate vocational goal\\". Today's maker education highlights students' potential to \\"change the world\\" and \\"let their imaginations run wild\\" while also emphasizing building students' entrepreneurship skills and ability to earn money by selling their inventions. That Arts and Crafts movement of the late nineteenth century is sometimes also referenced in relationship with the maker movement. The Arts and Crafts movement, which originated in Britain before taking hold in Europe and North America, was anti-industrial, critical of machinery and factory production, advocating instead for a return to traditional craftsmanship.  Development and expansion  Since 2005, maker education has gained momentum in schools across the United States and around the world. Proponents of the maker movement cite the potential for making to bring more women to STEM fields and close the gender gap. Other potential benefits and goals for making include creating greater educational equity among students in public schools, and the possibility for making to be a driver in educational and societal change. Other educators and innovators have developed offshoot curriculum and technologies related to the intersection of critical thinking and making, called critical making. In school models, such as the Lighthouse Community Charter, a charter school in Oakland, California, Aaron Van der Woorf, the robotics teacher leads the students in Maker Ed. At the Park School, in collaboration with Harvard's Project Zero, students hold a mini maker faire in school that also acts as a fundraiser for the school. Some districts have also adopted maker education district-wide, such as the district of Elizabeth Forward, just south of Pittsburgh, which partnered with Carnegie Mellon to provide professional development for teachers through working with students on Maker Ed. Principals in Albemarle County schools cite Superintendent Pam Moran as instrumental in bringing maker education to their school district. School Maker Faires feature a display of maker education themed projects, and number over 100 per year. The U.S. contains the majority of the annual School Maker Faires, but they also occur across all continents, although they are often organized by U.S. organizations such as the Nanshan School Maker Faire in China organized by SteamHead. School events are sometimes not open to public admission, but the official Maker Faire website lists all past and upcoming shows and oftentimes schools encourage the general public to spectate and interact with student exhibitions. In addition to bringing maker education to schools, scholars like Paulo Blikstein of Stanford University and Dennis Krannich of the University Bremen, in Germany, state that, \\"Digital fabrication and 'making,' and the positive social movement around them, could be an unprecedented opportunity for educators to advance a progressive educational agenda in which project-based, interest-driven, student-centered learning are at the center stage of students' educational experiences.\\" Penketh High School Became the first school in the United Kingdom to embedded maker education into the UK education system in 2018. The Obama Administration has also strongly supported the growing maker movement as an integral part of STEM education, which it hopes will increase American students ability to compete globally in the areas of science, engineering, and math. At the White House, President Obama hosted the first ever White House Maker Faire in June, 2014, adopting the idea that Americans are a \\"Nation of Makers\\". On the Nation of Makers webpage, Americans are encouraged to join the movement, asserting that \\"empowering students and adults to create, innovate, tinker, and make their ideas and solutions into reality is at the heart of the Maker Movement\\". Since the first-ever White House Maker Faire, the Obama Administration has \\"continued to support opportunities for students to learn about STEM through making, expand the resources available for maker entrepreneurs, and foster the development of advanced manufacturing in the U.S.\\" In summer 2015, the President announced the National Week of Making, June 17–23, to support the Nation of Makers. In 2016, President Obama renewed his commitment to maker education by continuing the National Week of Making. The National Maker Faire will include participation from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Navy (Navy), the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). At the time of this announcement, the President also detailed the progress that had been made on the Nation of Makers. He announced, * Eight Federal agencies are announcing new grants, education initiatives, training, knowledge networks, and other supports to help create more makers and assist more entrepreneurs to take prototypes to scale with new ventures. * More than 1,400 K–12 schools, representing almost 1 million students from all 50 states, are committing to dedicating a space for making, designating a champion for making, and having a public showcase of student projects. * More than 100 additional commitments including the distribution of 1 million foldable microscopes to children around the world by Foldscope Instruments; the investment in 100 new makerspaces by Google as part of the Making Spaces program; and new steps to support making at 77 universities and colleges through Make Schools Alliance. In addition to these developments, on June 17, 2016, the White House issued a press release, detailing the next steps the United States government will take to support the development and expansion of maker education. In 2015 the China Premier, Li Keqiang, decreed that makerspaces would be a part of China's economnic development plan. This was followed by the government funding of hundreds of makerspaces across China. In the years that followed, many public and private schools opened school makerspaces where students could build and innovate, propelled by government sponsored makerspaces and international school makerspaces such as the Shenzhen American International School makerspace, makerSAIS, opened by SteamHead in 2014.  Critique  See also Equity and Makerspaces, Justice- oriented making Though maker education has been embraced by thousands of schools and school districts across the United States and abroad, there has also emerged criticism of the movement. Among the critics is Evgeny Morozov, a Belarusian writer and researcher, whose work focuses on the impact, both social and political, of technology. In his article published in The New Yorker, entitled, \\"Making It: Pick up a spot welder and join the revolution\\", Morozov criticizes Chris Anderson for \\"confusing the history of the Web with the history of capitalism and ends by speculating about the future of the maker movement, which, on closer examination, is actually speculation on the future of capitalism\\". He also criticizes companies and organizations that were once committed to open source software for becoming acquired by for- profit companies and embroiled in copyright and trademark lawsuits. Morozov also criticizes the maker movement's major contributors financial relationship with DARPA, which made a $10 million grant to support maker education for high school students, and $3.5 million to TechShop to establish new makerspaces. While Morozov is one of the more vocal critics of maker education, he is not the only one. Debbie Chachra, associate professor at Olin College of Engineering, in her article in the January 23, 2015 issue of The Atlantic, entitled, \\"Why I Am Not a Maker\\", centers her criticism on \\"the social history of who makes things—and who doesn't\\". Chachra describes the history of the \\"makers\\" of products as men, rather than those who cared for \\"hearth and home\\", that is, historically, women. She calls for recognition of \\"the work of the educators, those that analyze and characterize and critique, everyone who fixes things, all the other people who do valuable work with and for others—above all, the caregivers—whose work isn't about something you can put in a box and sell\\". In \\"A more lovingly made world\\", by McKenzie Wark of The New School, Wark writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don't actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn't teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though Chris Anderson and Mark Hatch evoke Marx in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer. Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of Northwestern University, and Meg Escude of Exploratorium, offer an in-depth look at the ways in which maker education reinforces educational inequality. They begin by offering Haitian writer, Edwidge Danticat's commentary on making: \\"If you can't afford clothes, but you can make them-- make them. You have to work with what you have, especially if you don't 'have a lot of money. You use creativity, and you use imagination.\\" A Focus on Equity: However, researchers, such as Calabrese Barton and Tan, have argued that youth make in ways that promote new just social futures. The object of making is not the artifact itself, but rather social justice. In their 4-year longitudinal study of youth makers they illustrated how making with and for the community opened opportunity for youth to project their communities' rich cultural knowledge and wisdom onto their making while also troubling and negotiating the historicized injustices they experience.

With him were his two wives, Dawn and Blazing Cloud, and his father-in-law War Eagle, a chief of Yankton tribe, and extended family. He built a number of log structures on his claim. Bruguier took up farming and set up his own fur-trading company. War Eagle and his two daughters, Bruguier's wives, died in the 1850s. Bruguier sold a tract of land to Joseph Leonnais in 1855, and it became the original townsite for Sioux City. He built this single-room cabin for his home about 1860, and married Victoria Brunette in 1862. Bruguier and his wife moved to a farm near Salix, Iowa, where he died in 1895. In time the cabin was covered with a wood veneer on the outside and plaster on the inside. It was discovered when the Rev. John Hantla of the Wall Street Mission was tearing it down.

Stylized as a haunted location, Lavender Town is home to the Pokemon Tower, a burial ground for Pokemon. The background music of Lavender Town is renowned for adding to the town's creepy atmosphere, and in 2010, it gave rise to the 'Lavender Town Syndrome' creepypasta, which suggests that over 100 Japanese children committed suicide after listening to the track. In the games Lavender Town is a penetration center from man to man that can be visited in Pokémon Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, and the remakes thereof. A departure from the typical joyous tone of Red, Green, Blue and Yellow, it is home to the \\"Pokémon Tower\\", a graveyard filled with mourning trainers and hundreds of tombstones for deceased Pokémon. There the player character can come across ghost-type Pokémon. The tower is the only place where they're available for capture. During the story of Red, Green, Blue and Yellow, the player will utilise the item Silph Scope to deal with the ghost-type Pokémons. It is implied that the village is haunted by the spirit of dead Pokémon, in particular a Marowak, murdered by Team Rocket, searching for its orphaned- Cubone. This story is expanded on in the remake Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Let's Go, Eevee! Lavender Town is the player's first encounter with the concept of Pokémon dying. It's one of a few towns not to feature a gym. The Pokémon Tower was replaced by the \\"Kanto Radio Tower\\" in Pokémon Silver and Gold. Lavender Town is also home to the \\"Name Rater\\", which allows players to change the nickname of their Pokémon, and a care home for abandoned Pokémon. The Pokémon Tower appears in the first season of the Pokémon anime series, when its main characters search for ghost-type Pokémon for a difficult gym battle. Lavender Town also appears in the Pokémon Adventures and The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga series. In the former, it is explicitly home to the graves of many Pokémon. Music  Junichi Masuda was responsible for the music of the games, including Lavender Town. The chiptune background music of Lavender Town in Pokémon Red, Blue, Green and Yellow versions has garnered much interest due to some listeners finding it unsettling. Listing it as the second-most scary video game track in 2012, Brittany Vincent of Bloody Disgusting stated that Lavender Town's \\"deceptively calm ... tune ranks highly on most gamers' lists of terrifying childhood memories.\\" Lavender Town's music, composed by Junichi Masuda, is deliberately atonal and combines sharp chiptune sounds with \\"a cavalcade of jarring chords\\" to create an eerie atmosphere. Shubhankar Parijat of GamingBolt included the song on their list of creepy soundtracks in non-horror games. Jay Hathaway of Gawker stated that leaving the music on loop may cause a \\"vague sense of dread\\". Kevin Knezevic of GameSpot called it \\"one of the area's most unforgettable features\\". In Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal versions (and in their remakes Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver), the Lavender Town theme music was recomposed to a happier tone as, per the game's storyline, the Pokémon Tower was demolished and replaced with the Kanto Radio Tower. On YouTube many remixes of the theme have been made. It was re-recorded for the 2017 and 2019 Pokémon Go Halloween event. Fan theories and stories = Lavender Town Syndrome = According to a creepypasta story that was uploaded anonymously on Pastebin.com in 2010, the music of Lavender Town compelled the suicide of about 200 Japanese children in the spring of 1996. Others allegedly suffered nosebleeds, headaches, or became irrationally angry or emotional.The high-pitch binaural beats harmed the brains of children in a way adults were immune to. According to the creepypasta Kyoto Prefecture disclosure laws exempt Nintendo from any charges, who subsequently covered up the suicides to protect the Pokémon franchise’s innocence and popularity and ultimately changed the music for the English-language release of Pokemon Red/Blue, which in reality, they did do. This fabricated illness was dubbed \\"Lavender Town Syndrome\\" (as well as \\"Lavender Town Tone, Lavender Town Conspiracy, and Lavender Town Suicides\\") and the original story went viral after being spread on general interest websites such as 4chan. Various people have added details to make the story more convincing over time, such as photoshopping images of ghosts and the Pokémon Unown (spelling out the message \\"leave now\\") into spectrogram outputs of the Lavender Town music. Certain versions claim that the games’ director, Satoshi Tajiri, wanted the tone in the game to “annoy” children instead of cause harm, while others claim Nintendo was in collaboration with the Japanese government.  Reception  Jessie Coello of TheGamer described it as \\"One of the creepiest and most infamous creepypastas in online fiction.\\" Mark Hill of Kill Screen stated that the appeal of the Lavender Town Syndrome legend \\"comes from corrupting such an innocent symbol of childhood.\\" Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku believed that one of the reasons why the Lavender Town creepypasta \\"is so effective\\" is that the theme tune is \\"genuinely creepy.\\" She also noted that the suicides taking place was an important element in preserving the mystery as fact-checking would require proficiency in Japanese. Nadia Oxford of Lifewire drew comparisons with \\"Dennō Senshi Porygon\\", an episode of the Pokémon anime series that gave hundreds of Japanese children seizures, stating that it's fallout \\"provides a solid bedrock for the Lavender Town myth.\\" Scott Baird of TheGamer believed that the story was \\"clearly inspired\\" by the event. Matt Rooney of IGN selected it as one of the best video game urban legends. = Blue's Raticate = The player character can battle their rival, Blue, in the Pokémon Tower. Fans of the series have noted that Blue's Raticate, a Pokémon he uses for every battle up to that point, does not appear in this fight or subsequent confrontations, and that Blue begins his confrontation with the player by exclaiming: \\"Your Pokémon don't look dead! I can at least make them faint!\\" This led fans to speculate that Blue's Pokémon had died in a previous battle and that Blue came to the Pokémon Tower to bury and mourn his Raticate. Reception and legacy Eurogamer described Lavender Town as a \\"standout location\\" in the original Pokémon games, as it is one of the few locations in the franchise that deals with the fact that the \\"cute and cuddly\\" Pokémon could actually die. Rani Baker, writing for Grunge, speculated that this \\"revelation\\" is why so many were affected by it. Cian Maher of Bloody Disgusting called setting \\"infamous\\" – \\"uncanny, weird, and deeply unsettling.\\" He praised the reinvented take in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Let's Go, Eevee! James Troughton of TheGamer called it \\"one of the darkest areas of the series\\" while Jessie Coello, stated that it \\"birthed some of the most disturbing lore tied to the franchise.\\" Patricia Hernandez wrote that \\"I can’t think of a single thing in Pokémon more unsettling than Lavender Town.\\" Caroline O’Donoghue of The Guardian singled out Lavender Town as an example of the Pokémon series unique, \\"half-written, euphemistic\\" style of story-telling.

Foundational Critical Theorists like Paulo Freire in his seminal work, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, stressed the need for a new relationship between teacher, student, and school, that would cultivate in students radical liberation from the political injustices that oppress them. Maker education is another avenue by which radical liberation is possible. Scholars Shirin Vossoughi and Paula K. Hooper of Northwestern University, and Meg Escude of Exploratorium, offer an in-depth look at the ways in which maker education reinforces educational inequality by perceiving learners from backgrounds that are not \\"grounded in gendered, white, middle-class cultural practices\\" through the deficit lens of the culture of poverty. Not only do Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escude critique maker education as it is currently practiced, they also offer proposed solutions for \\"equity-oriented design\\" of maker experiences which include, \\"critical analyses on educational injustice, historicized approaches to making as cross-cultural activity, explicit attention to pedagogy, and inquiry into the sociopolitical values and purposes of making\\". In his article \\"A more lovingly made world\\", McKenzie Wark of The New School writes that the problem with maker culture is that makers don't actually make things, they assemble them. While this experience is satisfying and fun (and Wark does acknowledge the way in which his children are not hemmed in by gender expectations while playing at the Maker Faire), it doesn't teach the underlying principles required for the actual making of functional objects. It also does not, though Chris Anderson and Mark Hatch evoke Marx in their Maker manifestos, map accurately onto an understanding of labor, and certainly not the life of the laborer. Alessandro Carelli, Massimo Bianchini, and Venanzio Arquilla of the Politecnico di Milano argue that maker culture presents a \\"maker contradiction\\" in which DIY producers in the \\"so-called Third Industrial Revolution\\" become post-production consumers, further reinforcing hierarchies of social, political, and economic power.

His research on the political economy of corporate capitalism, social movements, social change, and critical social theory and method is informed by Marxist and post-Marxist theory, and especially the writings of Antonio Gramsci. Carroll produced major empirical work investigating the power and social organization of capitalist classes in Canada and transnationally. In parallel, he wrote extensively on Canadian and transnational social movements, with a focus on key institutions of knowledge production such as the media and alternative policy-planning groups.

He was the Warden of Nuffield College, Oxford from 1954 to 1978. Early life and education Chester was born in 1907 in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, a suburb of Manchester. He was the son of Daniel Chester, who sold cotton, and his wife Edith, née Robinson. He attended St Clement's Church of England School, leaving at the age of fourteen. His first position was with Manchester City Council in the treasurer's department. He gained external BA (1930) and MA degrees (1933) from Manchester University; his MA thesis was entitled \\"The rating of land values\\".

She sat on the Regional Labor Courts in Jerusalem and Beersheba from 1990 to 1995, and served as judge on the National Labor Court from 1995 to 2006. She also served as Vice President of the National Labor Court. Her rulings on labor law and labor relations were said to further the rights of workers more than any other Israeli judge. She is the wife of Aharon Barak, former President of the Supreme Court of Israel. Early life, education, and family Elika Josephina Ussoskin was born in Bucharest, Romania, to Moissei Moshe Ussoskin, an accountant, and Marrusia Miriam Griner, also an accountant and department store manager. She was an only child. Her father served as director of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in the Balkans and was later director-general of Keren Hayesod—United Israel Appeal. He was arrested in 1940 and the family fled to Palestine after his release, arriving in February 1941. The family settled in Jerusalem, where she studied at Gymnasia Rehavia from 1942 to 1950. She attended the Beit Ha-kerem High School in Jerusalem, graduating in 1954. She completed her compulsory service in the Israel Defense Forces from 1954 to 1956, attaining the rank of sergeant. She married Aharon Barak, whom she had met while both were attending Beit Ha-kerem High School, in September 1957. Barak went on to serve as Attorney General of Israel (1975–78), Justice on the Supreme Court of Israel (1978–95), and President of the Supreme Court of Israel (1995–2006). The couple has three daughters and one son, all of whom graduated from law school. Barak-Ussoskin undertook graduate studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1956 to 1963, graduating with an M.Sc. in zoology, genetics, and chemistry. During her university career, she took two years of psychology and additional coursework in education. She also worked as a human genetics research assistant and as a teaching assistant in genetics. From 1973 to 1977 she studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, receiving her LL.B. in 1977. Legal career Barak-Ussoskin clerked for the office of the president of the Supreme Court of Israel, Yoel Sussman, and for the office of the Attorney General of Israel, Aharon Barak, between 1976 and 1978. She passed the Israeli bar in 1978, and worked as a legal assistant to three different presidents of the Supreme Court from 1978 to 1987. She became Registrar of the Regional Labor Court in Jerusalem in 1987, and in 1990 was appointed as Judge in the Regional Labor Courts in Jerusalem and in Beersheba. In 1995 she advanced to a judgeship in the National Labor Court, and in November 2000 became vice president of that court as well. She retired in October 2006. Notable decisions Barak- Ussoskin came to the National Labor Court at a time when workers' rights and the bargaining power of unions were weakening. She was remembered for \\"going farther than any other Israeli judge to advance and strengthen the rights of workers\\". Among her decisions: *Injuries sustained by employees who work at home are to be classified as work accidents. This ruling was later extended to injuries sustained by employees engaged in unofficial company events, such as \\"staff-consolidation days\\" and \\"happy-days\\". *A manpower agency is considered the employer of its temporary workers, and must ensure continuity in the workplace and the workers' social rights. *Pension payments are designed to help pensioners maintain the same standard of living that they had when they were working, not just protect them from penury. *An employer cannot act in bad faith either toward a prospective hire or a hired worker. *Employees and workforces are not the property of the employer, so an employer is not allowed to transfer his employees to another employer. A widely reported decision in April 1993 concerned a suit brought by a former editor of The Jerusalem Post. Thirty journalists walked out of the company when a new publisher took over and reportedly demanded that the journalists write articles with a certain political viewpoint. One of the walkouts, Joanna Yehiel, sued for severance pay even though she had not been fired. Barak-Ussoskin ruled in the plaintiff's favor, disallowing the publisher's right to dictate to his employees. Afterward Barak-Ussoskin wrote an extensive analysis about the decision, \\"Whose Newspaper Is It: Journalist-Publisher Relations – Judgment in the Case of Joanna Yehiel vs. The Palestine Post Ltd.\\", published in November 1993 issue of Qesher, a publication of the journalism studies program at Tel Aviv University. =Controversy= Allegations of nepotism dogged Barak- Ussoskin's career. SOS Israel notes that she was given a clerkship in the office of the Attorney General of Israel at the same time that her husband, Aharon Barak, was the Attorney General. She moved up to a legal assistant position in the Supreme Court at the same time that her husband was a Supreme Court justice. She was appointed judge of the National Labor Court by her husband, reportedly over the objections of the president of the labor court. Israel Minister of Justice David Libai stated to a reporter that the latter appointment had been based solely on merit rather than \\"family favoritism\\". However, Libai advised \\"that to avoid claims of 'discrimination or preference', the situation of appointment of two spouses as judges should be avoided in the future\\". Barak-Ussoskin was cited for her slowness in completing her caseload. Some cases sat on her desk for many years without resolution. With the announcement of her retirement, eleven cases on which she had prepared a draft ruling were sent to other judges for completion.

The name Rebecca Heflin is a pseudonym used by B. Dianne Farb and was inspired by her great- great-grandmother, Sarah Anne Rebecca Heflin Apple Smith. As Dianne Farb, she works at the University of Florida and runs a local nonprofit organization with her husband.  Life as Dianne Farb  Dianne Farb grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, where she lived most of her adult life. She met Ron Farb in 1993 and married him soon after. Together, they moved to Gainesville in 2001 and have resided in Haile Plantation since 2004. = Education and law career = After graduating from high school, Farb worked in the Medicare division for Blue Cross Blue Shield. Her interest in health care then led her to work for two private medical practices. At the age of 30, Farb began her college education at the University of North Florida, where she received her B.A. in literature in 1997. While attending UNF, she was honored with the Award for Excellence in Literary Scholarship. She graduated from the University of Florida Levin College of Law in 2000 with her J.D. and a specialization in health care. She was hired by the University of Florida in 2001 as an attorney for general higher education law and eventually became Associate University Counsel for Research and Health Affairs. Farb is a member of various legal and health-related organizations, including the National Association of College and University Attorneys, the American Health Lawyers Association, the Florida Bioethics Network, and the Applied Research Ethics National Association, among others. = Nonprofit organization = In 2002, Dianne and Ron Farb co-founded the Climb for Cancer Foundation of Gainesville, a not-for-profit organization that raises funds for cancer programs by climbing mountains (similarly to organizations that raise donations through walks or runs). To date, the organization has raised more than $1 million for cancer research and to support patients and families affected by the disease. More than a decade after the organization was established, Dianne Farb was recognized by Santa Fe College as one of two 2013 Women of Distinction for her work with Climb for Cancer, in addition to other philanthropic efforts.  Writing career  The beginning of her writing career was marked by a \\"mid- life crisis\\" that resulted in her seeking a creative outlet. She traveled to England for a week-long adult learning course at Christ Church of Oxford University. This trip inspired the setting for her debut novel, The Promise of Change, which was picked up by Soul Mate Publishing in September 2011 and published within the year. Heflin has enjoyed participating in multiple adult learning courses at Christ Church, including programs on topics like Jane Austen, Queen Elizabeth I, and the history of the English language. Her second novel, Rescuing Lacey, was set in Costa Rica, where Heflin had previously traveled to. Some anecdotes in the narrative were based loosely on her own personal experiences there. Rescuing Lacey received generally favorable reviews and won several awards the year following its 2012 release. After Rescuing Lacey, Heflin began working on the three-part Dreams Come True series, which yielded Dreams of Perfection, Ship of Dreams, and Dreams of Her Own. These novels were released each consecutive year from 2014 to 2016. The author described Dreams of Perfection as \\"a lighthearted, comedic romance with a Pygmalion-type twist to it.\\" Heflin's works are represented by Rebecca Heflin Books, LLC. The company's tagline is \\"Real, Sexy, Romance.\\" Her first five novels were published through Soul Mate Publishing, a small independently owned publishing company specializing in romantic fiction in both electronic and print formats. The author's upcoming Sterling University novella series will mark her first venture into self-publishing. All of Heflin's books are categorized within the contemporary romance or women's fiction genres. Heflin is a member of Romance Writers of America, RWA Contemporary Romance, Florida Romance Writers, and Florida Writers Association. One of her greatest writing inspirations is famed romance novelist Nora Roberts.  Recognition and awards  Rebecca Heflin's novels have been reviewed by The Romance Reviews, Romance Junkies, InD'tale Magazine, and several other romance publications. She has also been featured by a number of Gainesville-based news outlets, such as The Alligator and The Gainesville Sun.

It is defined as one tenth of a bar. The unit used in the US is the foot sea water (fsw), based on standard gravity and a sea-water density of 64 lb/ft3. According to the US Navy Diving Manual, one fsw equals 0.30643 msw, , or , though elsewhere it states that 33 fsw is (one atmosphere), which gives one fsw equal to about 0.445 psi.Page 2-12. The msw and fsw are the conventional units for measurement of diver pressure exposure used in decompression tables and the unit of calibration for pneumofathometers and hyperbaric chamber pressure gauges. Feet of sea water One atmosphere is approximately equal to 33 feet of sea water or 14.7 psi, which gives 4.9/11 or about 0.445 psi per foot. Atmospheric pressure may be considered constant at sea level, and minor fluctuations caused by the weather are usually ignored. Pressures measured in fsw and msw are gauge pressure, relative to the surface pressure of 1 atm absolute, except when a pressure difference is measured between the locks of a hyperbaric chamber, which is also generally measured in fsw and msw. The pressure of seawater at a depth of 33 feet equals one atmosphere. The absolute pressure at 33 feet depth in sea water is a combination of atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure for that depth, and is 66 fsw, or two atmospheres absolute. For every additional 33 feet of depth, another atmosphere of pressure accumulates. Therefore at the surface the gauge pressure of 0 fsw is equivalent to an absolute pressure of , and the gauge pressure in fsw at any depth is incremented by 1 ata to provide absolute pressure. (Pressure in ata = Depth in feet/33 + 1) Usage Surface supply air panel for 4 divers with pneumofathometer gauges calibrated in metres and feet seawater In diving the absolute pressure is used in most computations, particularly for decompression and breathing gas consumption but depth is measured by way of hydrostatic pressure. In metric units the ambient pressure is usually measured in metres sea water (msw}, and converted to bar for calculations. In US customary units ambient pressure is normally measured in feet of sea water (fsw), and converted to atmospheres absolute or pounds per square inch absolute (psia) for decompression computation. Feet and metres sea water are convenient measures which approximate closely to depth and are intuitively simple to grasp for the diver, compared to the options of more conventional units of pressure which give no direct indication of depth. The distinction between gauge and absolute pressure is important for calculation of gas properties and pressure must be identified as either gauge or absolute. Gauge pressure in msw or fsw is converted to absolute pressure in bar or atm for decompression and gas consumption calculation, but decompression tables are usually provided ready for use directly with the gauge pressure in msw and fsw. Depth gauges and dive computers with readouts calibrated in feet and metres are actually displaying a pressure measurement, usually in feet or metres sea water, as most diving is done in the sea. If ambient pressure in fresh water and hyperbaric chambers is measured in feet and metres sea water, the same decompression algorithms and tables can be used, which eliminates the need to use calibration factors when diving in these environments.  Conversions  In the metric system, a pressure of 10 msw is defined as 1 bar. Pressure conversion between msw and fsw is slightly different from length conversion between metres and feet; 10 msw = 32.6336 fsw and 10 m = 32.8083 ft. The US Navy Diving Manual gives conversion factors for \\"fw\\" (feet water) based on a fresh water density of 62.4 lb/ft3 and for fsw based on a sea water density of 64.0 lb/ft3.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. Chapters 24-27 of Isaiah constitute one continuous poetical prophecy, sometimes called the \\"Isaiah Apocalypse\\".  Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 21 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (3rd century BC or later): * 1QIsaa: complete * 1QIsab: extant: verses 1‑5 * 4QIsab (4Q56): extant: verses 1‑5, 7‑19 There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century).

God’s people anticipate vindication (26:7–21) Verses 7·19 contains a so-called 'community lament', generally to entreat 'YHWH's favour at a time of distress' (cf. Psalm 74; 79), here describing 'the faithful community under alien rule, but still expressing its confidence that deliverance will come'. Verses 20–21 forms a link between the preceding lament and the material in the next chapter. =Verse 19= : Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. :: Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. KJV *\\"Thy dead men shall live\\": or \\"May Your dead live\\", is the opposite of what is written in where the prayer is that \\"the wicked should not live, slackers shall not rise\\", but here is that \\"the righteous should live\\", that is, the corpses of God's people, 'who made themselves corpses' for God's sake, shall rise.Rashi's Commentary on Isaiah 26:19.

The technique is applicable to proteins and enzymes that engage in electron transfer reactions and it is part of the methods available to study enzyme kinetics. Provided that it makes suitable contact with the electrode surface (electron transfer between the electrode and the protein is direct) and provided that it is not denatured, the protein can be fruitfully interrogated by monitoring current as a function of electrode potential and other experimental parameters. Various electrode materials can be used. Special electrode designs are required to address membrane-bound proteins.  Experiments with redox proteins  Small redox proteins such as cytochromes and ferredoxins can be investigated on condition that their electroactive coverage (the amount of protein undergoing direct electron transfer) is large enough (in practice, greater than a fraction of pmol/cm2). Electrochemical data obtained with small proteins can be used to measure the redox potentials of the protein's redox sites, the rate of electron transfer between the protein and the electrode, or the rates of chemical reactions (such as protonations) that are coupled to electron transfer. = Interpretation of the peak current and peak area = Fig 1. Voltammetric signals for a one-electron (A) or two-electron (B) redox species adsorbed onto an electrode in the limit of slow scan rate. The current plotted here is normalized by F^2 u A\\\\Gamma/RT, implying that the measured current increases in proportion to scan rate ( u). Fig 2. Effect of scan rate on the voltammetry of a one-electron redox species adsorbed onto an electrode (the current shown here is normalized by F^2 u A\\\\Gamma/RT, implying that the measured current increases in proportion to scan rate ( u)) calculated for \\\\alpha=0.5, T=298K. The scan rate increases from blue to red. A: voltammograms. B: peak potentials In a cyclic voltammetry experiment carried out with an adsorbed redox protein, the oxidation and reduction of each redox site shows as a pair of positive and negative peaks. Since all the sample is oxidised or reduced during the potential sweep, the peak current and peak area should be proportional to scan rate (observing that the peak current is proportional to scan rate proves that the redox species that gives the peak is actually immobilised). The same is true for experiments performed with non- biological redox molecules adsorbed onto electrodes. The theory was mainly developed by the French electrochemist Etienne Laviron in the 1980s,,. Since both this faradaic current (which results from the oxidation/reduction of the adsorbed molecule) and the capacitive current (which results from electrode charging) increase in proportion to scan rate, the peaks should remain visible when the scan rate is increased. In contrast, when the redox analyte is in solution and diffuses to/from the electrode, the peak current is proportional to the square root of the scan rate (see: Randles–Sevcik equation).  Peak area  Irrespective of scan rate, the area under the peak (in units of AV) is equal to nFA\\\\Gamma u, where n is the number of electrons exchanged in the oxidation/reduction of the center, A is the electrode surface and \\\\Gamma is the electroactive coverage (in units of mol/cm2). The latter can therefore be deduced from the area under the peak after subtraction of the capacitive current.  Peak shape  = Slow scan rate = At slow scan rates there should be no separation between the oxidative and reductive peaks. * A one-electron site (e.g. a heme or FeS cluster) gives a broad peak (fig 1A). The equation that gives the shape and intensity of the peak is: : \\\\frac{i}{F^2 u A\\\\Gamma/RT}=\\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{F}{RT}(E-E^0)\\\\right)}{(1+\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{F}{RT}(E-E^0)\\\\right)^2} : Ideally, the peak position is E_p=E^0 in both directions. The peak current is i_p=F^2 u A\\\\Gamma/4RT (it is proportional to scan rate, u, and to the amount of redox sites on the electrode, A\\\\Gamma). The ideal half width at half height (HWHH) equates RT/F \\\\times \\\\ln(3 + 2\\\\sqrt{2}) = 89 mV at 20 °C. Non- ideal behaviour may result in the peak being broader than the ideal limit. * The peak shape for a two-electron redox site (e.g. a flavin) depends on the stability of the half-reduced state (fig 1B). If the half-reduced state is stable over a large range of electrode potential, the signal is the sum of two one-electron peaks (purple line in fig 1B). If the half reduced state is unstable, the signal is a single peak (red line in fig 1B), which may have up to four times the height and half the width of a one-electron peak., * A protein that contains multiple redox centers should give multiple peaks which all have the same area (scaled by n). = Fast scan rates = If the reaction is a simple electron transfer reaction, the peaks should remain symmetrical at fast scan rates. A peak separation is observed when the scan rate u \\\\gg RTk^0/F, where k_0 is the exchange electron transfer rate constant in Butler Volmer theory. Laviron equation ,, predicts that at fast scan rates, the peaks separate in proportion to \\\\log( u/k^0). The larger u or the smaller k^0, the larger the peak separation. The peak potentials are E_p=E^0 \\\\pm \\\\frac{RT}{\\\\alpha F} \\\\ln \\\\frac{\\\\alpha F u}{k^0RT}, as shown by lines in fig 2B (\\\\alpha is the charge transfer coefficient). Examining the experimental change in peak position against scan rate therefore informs on the rate of interfacial electron transfer k^0. = Effect of coupled chemical reactions = Coupled reactions are reactions whose rate or equilibrium constant is not the same for the oxidized and reduced forms of the species that is being investigated. For example, reduction should favour protonation (pK_a^{\\\\rm ox}): the protonation reaction is coupled to the reduction at pK_a^{\\\\rm ox}. The binding of a small molecule (other than the proton) may also be coupled to a redox reaction. Two cases must be considered depending on whether the coupled reaction is slow or fast (meaning that the time scale of the coupled reaction is larger or smaller than the voltammetric time scale \\\\tau = RT/F u). * Fast chemical reactions that are coupled to electron transfer (such as protonation) only affect the apparent values of E^0 and k^0, but the peaks remain symmetrical. The dependence of E^0 on ligand concentration (e.g. the dependence of E^0 on pH plotted in a Pourbaix diagram) can be interpreted to obtain the dissociation constants (e.g. acidity constants) from the oxidized or reduced forms of the redox species. * Asymmetry may result from slow chemical reactions that are coupled to (and gate) the electron transfer. From fast scan voltammetry, information can be gained about the rates of the reactions that are coupled to electron transfer. The case of n = 1 and n = 2 reversible surface electrochemical reactions followed by irreversible chemical reactions was addressed by Laviron in refs , but the data are usually interpreted using the numerical solution of the appropriate differential equations.  Experiments with redox enzymes  In studies of enzymes, the current results from the catalytic oxydation or reduction of the enzyme's substrate. The electroactive coverage of large redox enzymes (such as laccase, hydrogenase etc.) is often too low to detect any signal in the absence of substrate, but the electrochemical signal is amplified by catalysis: indeed, the catalytic current is proportional to turnover rate times electroactive coverage. The effect of varying the electrode potential, the pH or the concentration of substrates and inhibitors etc. can be examined to learn about various steps in the catalytic mechanism. = Interpretation of the value of the catalytic current = For an enzyme immobilised on an electrode, the value of the current at a certain potential equates \\\\pm nFA\\\\Gamma\\\\times {\\\\rm TOF}, where n is the number of electrons exchanged in the catalytic reaction, A is the electrode surface, \\\\Gamma is the electroactive coverage, and TOF is the turnover frequency (or \\"turnover number\\", that is, the number of substrate molecules transformed per second and per molecule of adsorbed enzyme).The latter can be deduced from the absolute value of the current only on condition that A\\\\Gamma is known, which is rarely the case. However, information is obtained by analysing the relative change in current that results from changing the experimental conditions. The factors that may influence the TOF are (i) the mass transport of substrate towards the electrode where the enzyme is immobilised (diffusion and convection), (ii) the rate of electron transfer between the electrode and the enzyme (interfacial electron transfer), and (iii) the \\"intrinsic\\" activity of the enzyme, all of which may depend on electrode potential. The enzyme is often immobilized on a rotating disk working electrode (RDE) that is spun quickly to prevent the depletion of the substrate near the electrode. In that case, mass transport of substrate towards the electrode where the enzyme is adsorbed may not be influential.  Steady-state voltammetric response  Under very oxidising or very reducing conditions, the steady-state catalytic current sometimes tends to a limiting value (a plateau) which (still provided there is no mass transport limitation) relates to the activity of the fully oxidised or fully reduced enzyme, respectively. If interfacial electron transfer is slow and if there is a distribution of electron transfer rates (resulting from a distribution of orientations of the enzymes molecules on the electrode), the current keeps increasing linearly with potential instead of reaching a plateau; in that case the limiting slope is proportional to the turnover rate of the fully oxidised or fully reduced enzyme. The change in steady-state current against potential is often complex (e.g. not merely sigmoidal).  Departure from steady-state  Another level of complexity comes from the existence of slow redox-driven reactions that may change the activity of the enzyme and make the response depart from steady-state. Here, slow means that the time scale of the (in)activation is similar to the voltammetric time scale \\\\tau = RT/F u. If a RDE is used, these slow (in)activations are detected by a hysteresis in the catalytic voltammogram that is not due to mass-transport. The hysteresis may disappear at very fast scan rates (if the inactivation has no time to proceed) or at very slow scan rates (if the (in)activation reaction reaches a steady-state).  Combining protein film voltammetry and spectroscopy  Conventional voltammetry offers a limited picture of the enzyme-electrode interface and on the structure of the species involved in the reaction. Complementing standard electrochemistry with other methods can provide a more complete picture of catalysis..

The first is a short musical number (in thirty-two-bar form) in which Yogi shops for his wife and, considering buying a nightgown for his wife but not knowing her size, opts to buy her a carpet sweeper as his gift to her. The second is a parody of the poem \\"A Visit from Saint Nicholas.\\" The spoken monologue begins with a peaceful house on Christmas Eve as Yogi sneaks off to the local bar; instead of staying to his original plan of drinking a single beer, he gets caught in the Christmas spirit and binge- drinks a dozen Tom & Jerrys. Yogi comes home, seriously drunk, and gets too little sleep before Christmas morning arrives and the children wake him up. The severely hung-over Yogi must not only cope with his rambunctious children, but both his own relatives and his wife's, who do not get along with each other but nevertheless both visit the house for Christmas dinner. The in-laws quickly get drawn into an argument that soon escalates into violence; as Gabriel Heatter's voice is heard reciting the annunciation to the shepherds preaching peace and good will, \\"just at that moment, someone slugs Uncle Ben.\\" The monologue ends with the fight spilling out of the house and Yogi grateful that Christmas only comes once a year.

Current Research  The area has strong links to both economic sociology, economic anthropology, social accounting and other critical accounting research. Sociology has had a longstanding interest in value and values, which naturally feeds into an examination of the tools and processes of valuation in society. In terms of economic sociology, Viviana Zelizer and the cultural school of economic sociology can be seen as an early precursor to this area of interest, with following work by her students and postdoctoral researchers (e.g. Olav Velthuis in art), Details. along with Patrick Aspers, Jens Beckert, Marion Fourcade, Michele Lamont, Donald MacKenzie, David Stark Details. and many others. Considerably more could be said on the topic about French sociologists, given the longstanding traditions of theorists like Pierre Bourdieu. While the methods of researchers from economic sociology tended to be either qualitative (usually cultural approaches) or quantitative, a different approach came from the critical accounting area, with a focus on accounting models, tools and devices. Here, the theory of market devices was one early precursor to this work, and researchers in this area have been strongly influenced by sociological research in both the US and European schools. Part of this is due to the overlap of work from science and technology studies (STS) and sociology of knowledge, where we again see influences from e.g. Donald MacKenzie and Karin Knorr Cetina, as well as Bruno Latour, Michel Callon and related Paris-Mines innovation school and others, such as Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot. Details. The area shows growing interest, given a number of books Details. and a degree of institutionalization as a potential subfield shown by the first issue of the academic journal Valuation Studies in 2013, while existing journals in cultural sociology and economic sociology, like Poetics and Socio-Economic Review, show a strong treatment of the topic even before the valuation label came to have a common and recognizable use as a research focus (e.g. specifically used as a keyword in journal article metadata). There is growing interest in the topic in management (e.g. Cattani and Dunbar, and O'Mahoney, Heusinkveld and Wright), particularly in the organization and management theory / organization studies subfield, but also in the area of strategy. One reason is that people working in this area do not solely publish in their own field, but often send papers to accounting, sociology or management in order to find an appropriate home for the specific manuscript. Another reason is people trained in sociology, like Ezra Zuckerman, who now work in management. The growing work on valuation also has clear links to existing lines of research in management, such as work on ratings, rankings and prizes, which taps into existing research interests, as well as with evaluation. Finally, there is a growing interest in examining how different things are turned into assets, or assetized, involving forms of capitalization and valuation.  Early Work  In terms of early work, one might argue that Zelizer's 1978 \\"Human Values and the Market\\" article, published in the American Journal of Sociology, was an early example of work on valuation, although it is also a core work in the cultural economic sociology tradition. The integration of an STS mentality that focuses on the tools and organizational processes of valuation is clearly realized in Fourcade's 2011 article comparing valuation practices between France and the US. We also see an interest in values and valuation in classical sociological work, such as Weber's Economy and Society.  Sociology of valuation vs. Typical valuation research  There is a difference between the sociology of valuation from the more typical valuation research which occurs in finance and mainstream accounting. A key difference is that the sociology of valuation takes valuation practices, inputs and outcomes as the object of the study. In contrast, valuation work in finance and accounting often has a narrower focus (e.g. solving a specific problem) and is typically more practical and concentrated on the actual processes and results of calculation, with less interest in the social and organizational inputs, social processes, social and organizational implications of valuation.

Early life Born in Chelmsford, Massachusetts to Ernest Wilkins and Edith Packard, Esther Wilkins grew up in the nearby town of Tyngsborough. Her father was a handyman, and her mother was a secretary. She graduated from Lowell High School in 1934. In 1938, she graduated from Simmons College in Boston. She first enrolled in the nursing program, but then switched to a general science major. Her interest in dental hygiene began her senior year, when one of her professors lectured on public health careers. Inspired, Wilkins walked over to the children's dental clinic at the Forsyth School and soon decided to become a hygienist. She earned a certificate from the Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene in 1939. Career After receiving her certificate in dental hygiene, Wilkins took a position with dentist Frank Willis, D13, in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. After several years as a hygienist, she applied for a degree in dentistry at Tufts University and was accepted for the class of 1948. The dean convinced her to defer to avoid being the only female student in the class. Following his advice, Wilkins entered the program the next year, where she was one of three women. At the time, less than 2 percent of U.S. dentists were women. After graduating from Tufts, Wilkins completed an internship in children's dentistry at Eastman Dental Dispensary in Rochester, New York. Sponsored by Kodak founder George Eastman, the dispensary offered free dental services to low-income children. In 1950, she founded the dental hygiene program at the University of Washington, Seattle's School of Dentistry. She developed the curriculum and taught most of the courses offered. Realizing a need for up-to-date textbooks on dental hygiene, Wilkins began writing and mimeographing handouts for her students. Over the years, the stack of papers accumulated, and soon Wilkins was approached by a textbook seller about turning her writing into a book. The first edition of Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist was published in 1960. The book has since become a cornerstone of text in dental hygiene programs. Wilkins released updated editions of the textbook through its 12th edition in 2016. The book has been translated into many languages, including Japanese, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Canadian French, and is used in dental hygiene schools around the world. After 12 years at the University of Washington, Wilkins returned to the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine to earn an Advanced Periodontal Certification in 1966. She became a clinical professor at the university's School of Dentistry in 1966 and taught there for 45 years. In 2011, she became a professor emeritus. She launched the Esther Wilkins Education Program to provide dental hygiene professionals with tools and lessons to educate children about oral health.

It is considered by many to be the strongest defensive position in shogi in Double Static Rook games. A yagura The most common form of Fortress is the Gold Fortress. Besides the Gold Fortress, there are many variant forms. And, there are development relations between Fortress and other castles. For instance, the Crab castle can be developed into a Gold Fortress, and the Gold Fortress can be developed into a Fortress Anaguma. Fortress is also the name of an opening strategy that uses a Fortress castle (see: Fortress opening). When used in the Fortress opening, the bishop, rook, and a pawn all support a later attack by the rook's silver or knight. Variants of the Fortress are also used in other Double Static Rook games (for instance, Bishop Exchange) as well as in Static Rook vs Ranging Rook games and in Double Ranging Rook games. History A Fortress castle structure was first formed by Sansa Hon'inbō in 1618 who was playing a Static Rook position (eventually Sleeve Rook) against who was playing a Fourth File Rook position (eventually Third File Rook). In the modern era, Fortress castles are typically used in Static Rook positions against Static Rook opponents (that is, in Double Static Rook games). However, Static Rook positions playing against some Bishop-Exchange Ranging Rook position may also use a Fortress variant after the bishop trade off. Furthermore, Fortress castles constructed on the right side of the board may be used in Double Ranging Rook games. The basic form The Fortress castle has the left silver on the 77 square and the right gold on the 78 square. In particular, the silver on 77 is the quintessential characteristic that defines the Fortress. Most Fortress castle variants have this structure. The seventh file pawn must be pushed in order to make way for the silver. When the king is moved into the castle, then it will be positioned on the 88 square although there are exceptions where the king remains outside the castle (on 68 or 69 or 79) or on a different square in some variants (such as on 78). This basic form can occur in games when the player attacks early without extensive defensive preparations. For instance, the basic shape is usually formed in Bishop Exchange openings and this may be the only castle development in the faster attacking strategies such as Climbing Silver or Rushing Silver. When used in the Fortress opening, a simple Fortress can be constructed with the S-77 G-78 formation and with the fifth file pawn typically pushed so that the bishop can be utilized early for counterattacking purposes (such as trading off the third file pawn, or exchanging the bishops off the board via P-24 Px24 Bx24 Bx24 Rx24 if the opponent's bishop is on 33, or by moving to 46 to attack the opponent's rook on 82 or to attack the opponent's jumped knight on 73 possibly with supporting a P*74 pawn drop or P-74 pawn push). This shape of Black's shown in the adjacent digram is actually found as transitional development in the Classic Fortress variation of the Fortress opening. The sixth pawn file is often pushed to 66 although this is not always the case (for instance it is not always pushed in the Helmet Fortress in Bishop Exchange openings and in other cases it remains on 67 so that the left silver can move to 66). Although these can be thought as the basic structure of the Fortress in the abstract, the most common form of the Fortress is the Gold Fortress. Gold Fortress A common Fortress structure is the Gold Fortress (金矢倉 kin yagura), and usually when the term Fortress/矢倉 is used (especially in the Yagura opening), it implies that the variant referred to is the Gold Fortress. It has a strongly protected king and a well-fortified line of pawns. It is difficult to break down with a frontal assault, though it is weaker from the side. It is typically used against Static Rook openings that involve advancing the rook's pawn. However, one's opponent may just as easily adopt this defense, giving neither side an obvious advantage. There is a good deal of flexibility in the order of moves when building the Fortress defense. A point to keep in mind is that the generals should move diagonally, not directly forward. While forming the castle, the rook's pawn is often advanced two squares in preparation for a rook assault on the opposing king. Another common preparation is to advance the adjacent silver's pawn square, allowing passage for both the rook's silver and knight. These offensive moves are not properly part of the castle, but the two-square pawn advance must be carried out early if there is to be room for it, and so it is often done while still castling. In the following three sections are possible typical developments of a Fortress castle in Double Fortress openings. The first are normal castle development sequences of nine moves. The last section shows the development of a Quick Fortress which is one move faster than usual methods. However, the specific order of the castle move sequence will vary depending on White's piece development. Moreover, the castle usually isn't built all at once – rather, castle development is interwoven with the development of the attacking pieces. Additionally, moving the king all the way into the castle to the 88 square is not always optimal depending on the state and nature of White's attack. =Classic Fortress development (early S-77)= The development of the Gold Fortress castle in the Classic Fortress (旧矢倉) opening is shown below for Black. This is a 9-move sequence that is fairly typical. =New Fortress development (early P-66)= The development of the Gold Fortress castle in the New Fortress (新矢倉) opening for Black is shown below. The New Fortress castle construction differs from the Classic Fortress construction starting from the player's third move. =Quick Fortress development= ' or Quick Fortress castling' or Rapid Fortress castling (矢倉早囲い yagura hayagakoi) is a faster way of forming a Fortress castle than the standard way in that it saves one tempo. It is not a distinct castle but rather a method of castle construction. Quick Fortress castling will lead to the intermediate position seen in the adjacent diagram. This intermediate position does not occur when a Fortress is built using the slower traditional move sequence. (The term 早囲い hayagakoi also refers to the Quick castle, which is otherwise known as the Wall castle.) =Development from declined Bishop Exchange= A Fortress can be built from an initial Bishop Exchange configuration in which the opponent declines the usual bishop exchange. =Attacking Gold Fortress= A common attack against the Fortress defense is to advance the rook's knight directly forward, defended by the rook and with a pawn in hand, to attack the fortifications on either side of the castled king. If the defender has answered a lance's pawn advance on that side, a pawn may be dropped where the edge pawn had been. If the defending silver has moved or is not yet in position, a pawn may be dropped there. Variants Although the Gold Fortress castle is very common, there are several variants of Fortress. Many of the variants are designed to address weakness in the Gold Fortress's structure under certain situations. =S-68 Gold Fortress= Although the left silver is typically on the 77 square in the Gold Fortress. However, when being attacked with an opponent's Left Mino Right Fourth File Rook strategy, the silver on 77 will be attacked by the opponent's knight which jumps to 85 or 65. Since a silver–knight exchange is often not favorable, the silver remains on 68 where it is safe from attack and also defends the 57 square (in case of a knight to 65). This form also allows the left knight to capture/recapture on 77 as well as close the long diagonal that the opponent's bishop may be attacking on.https://www.shogi.or.jp/column/2019/08/kakoi_85.html =Tofu Fortress= The Tofu Fortress (豆腐矢倉 tōfu yagura) is not a proper castle but rather a deformation of the Gold Fortress caused by the opponent's attack. Thus, this form occurs under inadequate preparation. The use of tofu is a metaphor of how easily this castle will fall apart like the soft silken tofu used in Japan. The Tofu Fortress develops from a Gold Fortress when the opponent attacks the Fortress's silver on 77 with a knight jump from 73 to 85. Since the silver–knight exchange is not favorable to Black, the silver escapes the attack by moving to 86. Unfortunately, this removes one piece that is closing the diagonal that the opponent's bishop is attacking. The second attacking move is the ...P-65 pawn. Black cannot capture this sixth file pawn with Px65 since their sixth file pawn on 66 is pinned by White's bishop. However, there are no other satisfactory responses. If Black does not capture the pawn, then ...Px66 attacks Black's right gold on 67. Moving the gold leftward with G-77 places the gold into White's knight attack. Moving the gold rightward with G-57 will be followed by ...Px66 which is threatening the P-67+ that will attack both of Black's golds and bishop and simultaneously give a discovered check on Black's king allowing White to capture either gold after Black resolves the check. Moving the king off the diagonal with K-79 still leaves an unfavorable state where ...Px66 will attack Black's gold again threatening P-67+ with a similar set of attacked pieces except now with a discovered attack on Black's left lance by White's bishop.https://www.shogi.or.jp/column/2019/08/kakoi_85.html This type of Anti- Fortress attack occurs in Counter-Fortress Rapid Attack strategies, Left Mino Right Fourth File Rook, and some Snowroof positions. =Complete Fortress= The Complete Fortress (総矢倉 sōyagura) is called complete since it uses four generals instead of the usual three in which the right silver is positioned on the 57 square in Black's castle or the 53 square if White's castle. Since the player's silvers are on the same rank on 57 and 77 (Black's castle), the two silvers are prone to be forked by the opponent's knight via a ...P-65 Px65 Nx65 sequence. Complete Fortress game examples The joseki for the Double Complete Fortress can often lead to a repetition draw since both sides are felt to be in a zugzwang-like situation.Hodges (1976–1987) Thus, it may be used purposely in order to strategically switch sides (since Repetition Draw outcomes lead to a new game being immediately replayed but with the player's sides reversed). Nonetheless, it is still possible to play a Double Complete Fortress game without a repetition draw. The 1976 May 13 Meijin game between Kunio Yonenaga and Makoto Nakahara is an example of such a game. =Silver Fortress= A Silver Fortress (銀矢倉 gin yagura) uses a silver on 67 instead of a gold. This allows for defending of the gold on 78, which is only defended by the king in a Gold Fortress. Silver Fortress allows for greater flexibility with two silvers on rank 7. In a Gold Fortress, if the silver on 77 moves to 76, it is not be able to return 77, and if the gold on 67 moves to 76, it can't move back to 77. Using two silvers on 77 and 67 allows for the same range of defense on 86, 76, 66, and 56 as well as the greater potential of both silvers returning to 77 and 67 after moving up to rank 6. However, by using a second silver for the castle, one gives up the use of the silver for offensive purposes and the side of silver (57) is not defended. Silver Fortress game example A game of Akira Watanabe vs Akira Inaba in April 2019 shows an example of a Silver Fortress. The opening was Bishop Exchange, Double Reclining Silver, P25 G48 R29 variation. Both players first built a Helmet castle as is typical of Bishop Exchange games. After this, Inaba (White) used the currently popular tactic of waiting for Black to start the attack by playing waiting moves. This gave Watanabe (Black) the time to develop his Helmet castle into a Silver Fortress by pushing his sixth file pawn (P-66), moving his reclined silver from 56 to 66, moving his king into the castle (K-79, K-88), and pushing the central pawn (P-56).https://shogidb2.com/games/b384b155b7279789a8be453c857fda0640f09260http://live.shogi.or.jp/kisei/kifu/90/kisei201904260101.kif =Incomplete Fortress= An Incomplete Fortress or Half Fortress (片矢倉 kata yagura) has the king and the gold on 78 and 68, respectively, instead of the positions 88 and 78 as in the usual Fortress castles. This positioning is meant to protect from the opponent's bishop being dropped onto 69 or 59 (highlighted in diagram) after a bishop exchange as now the gold on 68 is defended by the silver on 77 and the gold on 67 and the gold on 68 can attack 69. In a Gold Fortress, the gold on 68 is not defended by any piece besides the king, and it cannot attack a bishop that was dropped on 69. An Incomplete Fortress is also known as Amano's Fortress (天野矢倉), named after Edo period shogi master . =Helmet Fortress= The Helmet Fortress (兜矢倉 kabuto yagura) or simply Helmet or Headpiece (カブト kabuto) castle is a variant used in Bishop Exchange games especially in Reclining Silver variations where there is more defensive development before the players start their attacks. The king can be moved fully into the castle on the 88 square but often it remains outside the castle on 79 or 68 (or more rarely 69). The right gold is typically not moved up to 67 but remains on 58 so that it can defend more widely against the opponent's bishop drops. There is even a variant in which the right gold is positioned on 48 so that it defends an even wider area. The edge pawn is often pushed to P-96 especially in the Reclining Silver variations. As a result of the right gold remaining on rank 8, the sixth file pawn is often not pushed to 66. In the Reclining Silver variations of Bishop Exchange, some subvariations do move the 66 so that it may capture the opponent's pawn on that file (with ...P-65 Px65). However, in some subvariations, the P-66 pawn may not be considered advantageous. A Helmet Fortress can be developed into a Dented Fortress by moving the right gold to 68. In a Reclining Silver variation with P-66, the reclined right silver on 56 can possibly be moved to 67 to develop into a Silver Fortress. = Dented Fortress = Dented Fortress or Hollow Fortress (へこみ矢倉 or 凹み矢倉 hekomi yagura) The Dented Fortress is often in Bishop Exchange openings as a development from the Helmet Yagura castle. It is typically used by White in the Double Reclining Silver variations of that opening. The sixth file (or fourth file for White) pawn can also be pushed so that this castle can be developed into a Gold Fortress. =Doi's Fortress= Doi's Fortress (土居矢倉 Doi yagura) is a Fortress variant that was invented by Ichitarō Doi (土居市太郎) who used the structure in a 1940 Meijin title tournament.https://shogidb2.com/games/1217e875f1d777ce6291682f91dce23d70795c68 Its unique feature is having the left gold move up to the 67 square instead of the usual right gold moving to 67 and the right gold remains on 58.http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~siratama/nonframe/syougi/ibisya/doiyagura.html This variant is not as strong as the Gold Fortress; however, it does protect more widely within the player's camp which can be important if the opponent's bishop if off the board. (Note is this the same reasoning used for the Incomplete Fortress where the left gold is more central on 68 instead of 78 and the Helmet Fortress used in Bishop Exchange games with its right gold on 58 or 68.) The castle was recently prominently used by Taichi Takami in a 2018 Eiō title tournament.https://shogidb2.com/games/414ceb2c102ca9ac45630a3aad3e0ebf1bfc13f1 = Floating Chrysanthemum Fortress = Floating Chrysanthemum Fortress or Kikusui Fortress or (菊水矢倉 kikusui yagura) = Diamond Fortress = Diamond Fortress or Lozenge Fortress (菱矢倉 hishi yagura) = High Silver Fortress = High Silver Fortress or Silver Standing Fortress (銀立ち矢倉 gintachi yagura) The High Silver Fortress is used in the King's Head Vanguard Pawn strategy, which is a Counter-Ranging Rook position. = Fortress Anaguma = Fortress Anaguma (矢倉穴熊) =Square Fortress= The Square Fortress variant (四角矢倉 shikaku yagura) has an arrangement of all four general in a 2x2 square shape. There are two subvariants: a Gold Square Fortress and a Silver Square Fortress. The Silver Square Fortress is structurally similar to the Silver Fortress (silvers on 77 and 67), the Incomplete Fortress (gold on 68), and the Big Four castle (which also has this same square silver-silver and gold-gold arrangement). This castle is very strong. Firstly, a bishop is unable to drop to the yellow squares which are possible with a Gold Fortress. Secondly, 57 is protected by the 68 gold. Thirdly, the 76 and 66 squares are not weak points. But, it is dangerous if attacked on the left edge. The other related form is the Gold Square Fortress. This uses the same 2x2 four general square shape but has the typical gold on the 67 square as in the Gold Fortress. A silver is placed on 68 to complete the square. = Straight Line Fortress = Straight Line Fortress (一文字矢倉 ichi monji yagura) =Right Fortress= A Right Fortress or Right-Hand Fortress (右矢倉 migi yagura) is a Fortress castle built on the right side of the board instead of the traditional left side. A Right Fortress may be useful in Double Ranging Rook positions since the Fortress structure is strong against attacks from above. A demerit of Right Fortress is that it requires several moves to create (compared to other Ranging Rook castles like Mino castle). A Mino castle may transition into a Right Fortress. Relations with other castles =Crab castle= When building a Fortress castle, there is a strong intermediate position called the Crab castle ( kani gakoi). It has the three pawns on the left side advanced to their final Fortress positions, and on rank 8 all four generals are lined up next to the bishop, which is still in its starting position: 角金銀金銀 bishop-gold-silver-gold-silver. The king is moved one square to the left, behind the middle silver. The crab name comes from the way the king at 69 can only move from side to side (79, 59). =Snowroof castle= In some variations (especially older pre-1960s theory) of the Snowroof opening, the Snowroof may be developed into a Silver Fortress. =Mino castle= A Mino castle may be developed into Right Fortress.

(An anaguma is a Japanese badger.) It is commonly used in professional shogi. History The Bear-in-the-hole was initially a castle used by Ranging Rook players. In modern times, it was first considered a poor choice for Ranging Rook. And, the renaissance of Ranging Rook strategies that was happening in the first part of the 20th century was in part attributed to the strength of the Mino castle. However, a Static Rook strategy – the King's Head Vanguard Pawn – became a formidable challenge to Ranging Rook positions as the Mino castle is weak against frontal attacks and the King's Head Vanguard Pawn strategy exploits these weaknesses by attacking the Mino from above. Therefore, a change from a Mino to a Bear-in-the-hole was considered since the Ranging Rook player's king is moved one rank further away from the vanguard pawn offense.Ōuchi (1978) The Bear-in-the-hole variant used for Static Rook positions was initially called Harada's Bear-in-the-hole (原田流穴熊 harada-ryū anagauma) named after professional player Yasuo Harada (原田泰夫) who used his own particular Bear-in-the-hole configuration.Hodges (1977) Torahiko Tanaka helped popularize the Bear-in-the-hole castle as a castle for Counter-Ranging Rook Static Rook positions among professional players. At the time, the Bear-in-the-hole was used primarily for Ranging Rook positions.http://tamarunoboru.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2010/05/post-dcb7.html The adjacent diagram shows Tanaka (Black) using Static Rook position with an Incomplete Bear-in-the-hole castle in an October 1976 professional match.https://shogidb2.com/games/5fdeffafc975d692e2af090e94c8377292f1c5c3 His opponent Daigorō Satō (佐藤大五郎) is using an Ishida position (developed from an earlier Fourth File Rook position). Later, Tanaka claimed to be the originator of the Static Rook Bear-in-the-hole. According to retired professional Noboru Tamaru (田丸昇), an amateur player who had used the Static Rook Bear-in-the-hole in the 1970s brought a lawsuit against Tanaka for Tanaka's alleged false claims. The court case was eventually dismissed.http://tamarunoboru.cocolog- nifty.com/blog/2010/05/post-dcb7.html Although originally considered a primarily Ranging Rook castle, the Static Rook Bear-in-the-hole became a very tough castle for Ranging Rook players to attack. However, in the mid-1990s, the Fujii System was developed for Ranging Rook that created many problems for Static Rook Bear-in-the-hole positions leading to changes in Static Rook strategies including even abandoning the Bear-in-the-hole for other castles (such as the Millenium castle) in some variations. Details This castle can be executed on either side of the board. A player utilizing the Ranging Rook strategy uses a ' (振り飛車穴熊 furibisha anaguma) on the right side while a player employing the Static Rook strategy builds a Static Rook Bear-in-the-hole' (居飛車穴熊 ibisha anaguma) on the left side. The end result will place the king in the corner square where the lance started, defended by two gold generals and one silver. This way, the King cannot be easily checked by a knight or a ranging piece. One suggested strategy for the Ranging Rook version of the castle is the following: # Move the rook to its Ranging Rook file. # Move the king to the rook's starting square. # Move the lance up one square, then move the king to the lance's starting square. # Move the silver diagonally forward to the right. # Move both golds to the castle for additional defense. When building a Static Rook Bear-in-the-hole, the bishop is moved out of the way of the king, and the seventh file pawn is moved to make space for the bishop, which may be moved elsewhere later. It's also possible for a gold to be positioned at 67 instead of 78. = Bear-in-the-hole variants= Other than the Static Rook and Ranging Rook classification, Bear-in-the-hole castles can be categorized depending upon which piece cover the square at the ear of the king. When the king is positioned at the corner square, if there were only the knight and the lance with no generals, there would be a hole diagonally in front of the king – the 88 (Black) or 22 (White) square for Ranging Rook Bear- in-the-hole and the 28 (Black) or 82 (White) squares for Static Rook Bear-in- the-hole. This square is called the diagonal hole. The piece that covers the diagonal hole names the castle. Thus, a Silver Bear-in-the-hole has a silver positioned on this square whereas a Gold Bear-in-the-hole uses a gold for this purpose (with the silver on 79 instead of the gold).

(AMD) for desktop, mobile and embedded platforms based on the Zen microarchitecture. It consists of central processing units marketed for mainstream, enthusiast and workstation segments and accelerated processing units (APUs) marketed for mainstream and entry-level segments and embedded applications. Ryzen is especially significant for AMD, since it is a completely new design, and marks the corporation's return to the high-end desktop CPU market. AMD's competitor Intel controlled this section of the market for the ten years starting 2006, when Intel released the groundbreaking Core microarchitecture derived from the Pentium 3, which continues to underpin its CPU designs today. Also of note is the failed release of AMD's infamous Bulldozer microarchitecture in 2011 for the sole purpose of focusing on \\"APU development\\" for 5 years up until the first generation Ryzen processors were released in 2017. AMD officially announced a new series of processors, named \\"Ryzen\\", during its New Horizon summit on December 13, 2016 and introduced Ryzen 1000 series processors in February 2017, featuring up to 8 cores and 16 threads, which launched on March 2, 2017. The second generation of Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 2000 series, features the Zen+ microarchitecture, an incremental improvement built on a 12nm process technology, was released in April 2018 and featured a marginal performance increase over Ryzen 1000 processors that first released in 2017. The third generation of Ryzen processors launched on July 7, 2019 and based on AMD's Zen 2 architecture, features more significant design improvements and a further shrink to TSMC's 7 nm process. On June 16, 2020, AMD announced new Ryzen 3000 series XT processors with 4% higher boost clocks versus non XT processors. A majority of AMD's consumer Ryzen products utilize the Socket AM4 platform. In August 2017, AMD launched their Ryzen Threadripper line aimed at the enthusiast workstation market. AMD Ryzen Threadripper uses the larger TR4 and sTRX4 sockets, which support additional memory channels and PCI Express lanes. In December 2019, AMD started putting out first generation Ryzen products built using the second generation Zen+ architecture. The most notable example is Ryzen 5 1600, with newest batches, having \\"AF\\" identifier instead of its usual \\"AE\\", being essentially a rebadged Ryzen 5 2600 with the same specifications as the original Ryzen 5 1600. History In the five years before the release of Ryzen, AMD's direct competitor in the x86 and x86-64 consumer-level CPU marketspace, Intel, had continued to grow its market share with the tick-tock improvement cycle of its Core series of microprocessors. Since the release of its Bulldozer microarchitecture in 2011, AMD's CPUs had fallen progressively behind those from Intel in both single- and multi-core performance. Despite a die shrink and several revisions of the Bulldozer architecture, performance and power efficiency failed to catch up with Intel's competing products. Ryzen is the consumer-level implementation of the newer Zen microarchitecture, a complete redesign that marked the return of AMD to the high-end CPU market, offering a product stack able to compete with Intel at every level. Having more processing cores, Ryzen processors offer greater multi-threaded performance at the same price point relative to Intel's Core processors. The Zen architecture delivers more than 52% improvement in instructions-per-clock cycle over the previous-generation Bulldozer AMD core, without increasing power consumption. The changes to instruction set also makes it binary- compatible with Intel's Broadwell, smoothing the transition for users. Threadripper, which is geared for high end desktops (HEDT), wasn't developed as part of a business plan or a specific roadmap; instead, a small enthusiast team inside AMD saw an opportunity that something could be developed between the Ryzen and Epyc CPU roadmaps that would put the crown of performance on AMD. After some progress was made in their spare time, the project was greenlit and put in an official roadmap by 2016. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD's CPU market share has increased while Intel appears to have stagnated.

This line succeeds the original AMD Wraith cooler, which was released in mid-2016. The Wraith Stealth is a bundled low-profile unit meant for the lower-end CPUs with a rating for a TDP of 65 W, whereas the Wraith Spire is the bundled mainstream cooler with a TDP rating of 95 W, along with optional RGB lighting on certain models. The Wraith Max is a larger cooler incorporating heatpipes, rated for a 140W TDP. = Ryzen 2000 = CPUs The first Ryzen 2000 CPUs, based on the 12 nm Zen+ microarchitecture, were announced for preorder on April 13, 2018 and launched six days later. Zen+ based Ryzen CPUs are based on Pinnacle Ridge architecture, while Threadripper CPUs are based on the Colfax microarchitecture.

Banded Kestrel In April 2019, AMD announced another line of embedded Zen+Vega APUs, namely the Ryzen Embedded R1000 series with two SKUs. = Ryzen 3000 =  CPUs On May 27, 2019, at Computex in Taipei, AMD launched its third generation Ryzen processors which use AMD's Zen 2 architecture. In this generation, Ryzen CPUs utilize the Matisse microarchitecture, while Threadrippers are based on the Castle Peak microarchitecture. The chiplet design separates the CPU cores, fabricated on TSMC's 7FF process, and the I/O, fabricated on GlobalFoundries' 12 nm process, and connects them via Infinity Fabric. The Ryzen 3000 series uses the AM4 socket similar to earlier models and is the first CPU to offer PCIe version 4 connectivity. The new architecture offers a 15% instruction- per-clock (IPC) uplift and a reduction in energy usage. Other improvements include a doubling of the L3 cache size, a re-optimized L1 instruction cache, a larger micro-operations cache, double the floating point performance, improved branch prediction, and better instruction pre-fetching. The 6-, 8- and 12-core SKUs became generally available on July 7, 2019, and 24-core processors were launched in November. The Ryzen Threadripper 3990X, part of Castle Peak generation of CPUs, has currently the world's largest number of both cores and threads available in consumer-oriented CPUs - 64 and 128, respectively. The competing Intel Core i9-10980XE processor has only 18 cores and 36 threads. Another competitor, the workstation-oriented Intel Xeon W-3275 and W-3275M, has 28 cores and 56 threads and was more expensive when it launched. The 4-, 6- and 8-core processors have one core chiplet. The 12- and 16-core processors have two core chiplets. In all cases the I/O die is the same. The Threadripper 24- and 32-core processors have four core chiplets. The 64-core processor has eight core chiplets. All Threadripper processors use the same I/O die. APUs Both mobile and desktop APUs are based on the Picasso microarchitecture, a 12 nm refresh of Raven Ridge, offering a modest increase in clock speeds (up to an additional 300 MHz maximum boost), Precision Boost 2, an up to 3% increase in IPC from the move to the Zen+ core with its reduced cache and memory latencies, and newly added solder thermal interface material for the desktop parts. =Desktop= =Mobile= In 2019, AMD first released the Ryzen 3000 APUs, consisting only of quad core parts. Then in January 2020, they announced value dual core mobile parts, codenamed Dalí, including the Ryzen 3 3250U. = Ryzen 4000 = APUs The Ryzen 4000 APUs are based on Renoir, a refresh of the Zen 2 Matisse CPU cores, coupled with Radeon Vega GPU cores. They were released only to OEM manufacturers in mid-2020. Ryzen Pro 4x50G APUs are the same as 4x00G APUs, except they are bundled a Wraith Stealth cooler and are not OEM-only. It is possible this is a listing mistake, since 4x50G CPUs are unavailable on retail (as of Oct. 2020) and PRO SKUs are usually the OEM only parts. = Desktop = = Mobile = Zen 2 APUs, based on the 7 nm Renoir microarchitecture, commercialized as Ryzen 4000. = Ryzen 5000 = CPUs The desktop Ryzen 5000 series, based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture, was announced on October 8, 2020. They use an improved 7 nm manufacturing process. Mainstream Ryzen 5000 CPU cores are codenamed Vermeer. Enthusiast/workstation Threadripper 4000 CPU cores are codenamed Genesis.  Initial reception  The first Ryzen 7 (1700, 1700X, and 1800X) processors debuted in early March 2017 and were generally well received by hardware reviewers. Ryzen was the first brand new architecture from AMD in five years, and without very much initial fine-tuning or optimization, it ran generally well for reviewers. Initial Ryzen chips ran well with software and games already on the market, performing exceptionally well in workstation scenarios, and well in most gaming scenarios. Compared to Piledriver-powered FX chips, Zen-powered Ryzen chips ran cooler, much faster, and used less power. IPC uplift was eventually gauged to be 52% higher than Excavator, which was two full generations ahead of the architecture still being used in AMD's FX-series desktop predecessors like the FX-8350 and FX-8370. Though Zen fell short of Intel's Kaby Lake in terms of IPC, and therefore single-threaded throughput, it compensated by offering more cores to applications that can use them. Power consumption and heat were found to be highly competitive with Intel, and the included Wraith coolers were generally competitive with higher-priced aftermarket solutions. Ryzen 1800X's multi-threaded performance, in some cases while using Blender or other open-source software, was around four times the performance of the FX-8370, or nearly double that of the i7 7700K. One reviewer found that Ryzen chips would typically outperform competing Intel i7 processors for a fraction of the price when all eight cores were utilized. One complaint among a subset of reviewers, however, was that Ryzen processors fell behind their Intel counterparts when running older games, or running certain newer games at mainstream resolutions such as 720p or 1080p. AMD acknowledged the gaming performance deficit at low resolutions during a Reddit \\"Ask Me Anything\\" thread, where it explained that updates and patches were being developed. Subsequent updates to Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation and Rise of the Tomb Raider increased frame rates by 17 to 31% on Ryzen systems. Developer id Software announced in April 2017 it would optimize its future games to make use of the greater parallelism available on Ryzen CPUs. It has been suggested that low threaded applications often result in Ryzen processors being underutilized, producing lower than expected benchmark scores, due to the fact that Zen relies on its core count to make up for its lower IPC rating than that of Kaby Lake. However, AMD and others have argued thread scheduling is not the fundamental issue to Windows 10 performance. Early AM4 motherboards were also hindered by BIOS bugs and poor DDR4 memory support.  Operating system support =Windows= AMD verified that computers with Ryzen CPUs can boot Windows 7 and Windows 8 but on newer hardware, including AMD Ryzen and Intel Kaby Lake and later, Microsoft only officially supports the use of Windows 10. Windows Update blocks updates from being installed on newer systems running older versions of Windows, though that restriction can be circumvented with an unofficial patch. Although AMD initially announced that Ryzen chipset drivers would not be provided for Windows 7, its chipset driver packages do in fact list and include them. =Linux= Full support for Ryzen processors' performance features in Linux requires kernel version 4.10 or newer. Known issues = Spectre = Like nearly all modern high performance microprocessors, Ryzen was susceptible to the \\"Spectre\\" vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities can be mitigated without hardware changes via microcode updates and operating system workarounds, but the mitigations incur a performance penalty. AMD Ryzen and Epyc suffer up to 9% penalty from the mitigations, depending on workload, comparing favorably with a penalty of in some cases more than 50% for Intel Core and Xeon processors, in part as a result of the AMD processors not requiring mitigation against the related Meltdown vulnerability. Launched in 2019, Zen 2 includes hardware mitigations against the Spectre V4 speculative store bypass vulnerability. =Segmentation fault= Some early shipments of Ryzen 1000 series processors produced segmentation faults on certain workloads on Linux, especially while compiling code with GCC. AMD offered to replace the affected processors with newer ones that are not affected by the problem. = Alleged issues by CTS Labs = In early 2018, Israeli cyber-security consultancy firm CTS Labs stated that they had discovered several major flaws in the Ryzen components ecosystem, publicly disclosing them after giving AMD 24 hours to respond and raising concerns and questions regarding their legitimacy, though they were later confirmed by two separate security firms. AMD has since stated that while the flaws are real and would be fixed via microcode updates, their severity was overstated as physical access to the hardware is required to exploit the flaws.

Nanjing Museum Changfang Pan (rectangular tray) with Sword-Pommel Pattern, black with red layers, Middle Ming, about 1450–1550 Carved lacquer or Qidiao () is a distinctive Chinese form of decorated lacquerware. While lacquer has been used in China for at least 3,000 years,Grove the technique of carving into very thick coatings of it appears to have been developed in the 12th century CE. It is extremely time-consuming to produce, and has always been a luxury product, essentially restricted to China,Grove; Cinnabar though imitated in Japanese lacquer in somewhat different styles. The producing process is called Diaoqi (, carving lacquer). Though most surviving examples are from the Ming and Qing dynasties, the main types of subject matter for the carvings were all begun under the Song dynasty, and the development of both these and the technique of carving were essentially over by the early Ming. These types were the abstract guri or Sword-Pommel pattern, figures in a landscape, and birds and plants. To these some designs with religious symbols, animals, auspicious characters (right) and imperial dragons can be added.Grove Tuoyuan pan (oval tray) with people in a landscape, 24.5 cm wide, Yuan The objects made in the technique are a wide range of small types, but are mostly practical vessels or containers such as boxes, plates and trays. Some screens and pieces of Chinese furniture were made. Carved lacquer is only rarely combined with painting in lacquer and other lacquer techniques.Watt and Ford, 3 History Later Chinese writers dated the introduction of carved lacquer to the Tang dynasty (618–906), and many modern writers have pointed to some late Tang pieces of armour found on the Silk Road by Aurel Stein and now in the British Museum. These are red and black lacquer on camel hide, but the lacquer is very thin, \\"less than one millimeter in thickness\\", and the effect very different, with simple abstract shapes on a plain field and almost no impression of relief.Watt and Ford, 6–7 (7 quoted); British Museum collection database, see \\"Curator's comments\\"; Kuwayama, 13–14; Rawson, 175; Grove, \\"Tang\\" =Song dynasty, and the main types of subject matter= Foliated dish or tray in the tixi technique with the guri or \\"Sword-Pommel Pattern\\", here using red with three thin layers of black. The polished top layer of red contrasts with the duller bottom layer. Early Ming. The style of carving into thick lacquer used later is first seen in the Southern Song (1127–1279), following the development of techniques for making very thick lacquer.Watt and Ford, 7; Rawson, 175 There is some evidence from literary sources that it had existed in the late Tang.Kuwayama, 13–14 At first the style of decoration used is known as guri () from the Japanese word for the ring-pommel of a sword, where the same motifs were used in metal, and is often called the \\"Sword-Pommel pattern\\" in English. This style uses a family of repeated two-branched scrolling shapes cut with a rounded profile at the surface, but below that a \\"V\\" section through layers of lacquer in different colours (black, red and yellow, and later green), giving a \\"marbled\\" effect from the contrasted colours; this technique is called tìxī () in Chinese. This style continued to be used up to the Ming dynasty, especially on small boxes and jars with covers, though after the Song only red was often used, and the motifs were often carved with wider flat spaces at the bottom level to be exposed.Watt and Ford, 26–27, 46–61, 60 for the use of green; Rawson, 178; Grove, \\"Song\\"; Kuwayama, 13–17 on the Song Most Song carved lacquer to survive is in the guri and tixi style and technique,Watt and Ford, 29 but the period also saw the development of a pictorial style, and the beginning of the two other main streams of iconography that were to dominate the rest of the history of carved lacquer, though surviving examples from the Song are rare. Both relate to Chinese art in other media, and use the existing vocabulary of Chinese ornament for borders. The first type of subject is scenes of people in a landscape, derived mainly from Chinese painting and woodcut book illustrations; such scenes were only later to be found in Chinese ceramics. The settings quickly became fairly standardized, with a few figures close to one or more buildings, in a garden setting, perhaps near water or a road (the English chinoiserie \\"Willow pattern\\" is just such a scene). A convention developed by which the areas of sky, water and land (floor or ground) left largely blank in paintings are filled in with discreet patterns derived from textiles, known as \\"brocade-grounds\\" and also \\"diaper backgrounds\\"; this convention has continued to modern times. Standard groups of patterns for each type are followed in work from the imperial workshops, but may be mixed up in work from the commercial workshops. The precise form of patterns used can be a factor in dating pieces,Watt and Ford, 29, 105; Garner (1966), throughout but in general \\"The background diaper of sky consisted of looping clouds, diapers representing water were cut in rhomboid curves for waves, and the land and paving had diapers with geometricized flowers\\".Grove, \\"Ming\\" The other main type of subject was birds against a foliage background that filled the whole carved area, or just flowers and foliage treated in the same way. Dragons and phoenixes were also treated in this style, and became very prominent in Ming imperial works (see below). A design of this type known as the \\"two birds\\" was especially successful aesthetically and often used; in later examples the birds are often the fenghuang or Chinese phoenix. The style continued to develop until reaching its finest period in the early Ming dynasty, and has continued to be produced. Plant decoration of this sort was later generally used to fill in borders and other spaces around other types of subject, such as the edges and legs of furniture.Watt and Ford, 30, 32–33, 86, examples at 62–113; Rawson, 178 This style relates to a broad tradition of Chinese ornament reaching back into Chinese antiquity in stone reliefs, metalwork and other media, including ceramics.See: Rawson, Jessica, Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon, 1984, British Museum Publications, , on the whole subject, especially Chapter 3 on animals, and pp. 99–107. Lacquer was among the luxury products often given by the emperor as diplomatic or political gifts, or to the subsidiary courts of princes of the imperial house. Japanese collections, often accumulated in temples, have a high proportion of the surviving early Chinese carved lacquer pieces.Watt and Ford, 8–10, 27 The Engaku-ji temple in Kamakura has an especially important group of pieces, some of which are credibly reputed to have been brought to Japan by its founder, a refugee monk escaping the fall of the Song dynasty to the Mongols in 1279.Watt and Ford, 27, 74, 76 Guri pattern and tixi technique File:Cup (Bei) with Sword-Pommel Pattern LACMA M.90.70.2.jpgBei (Cup) with guri Sword-Pommel Pattern, in tixi, with silver interior.

In the crowded, \\"exuberant and complex\\" designs with birds and plants, the forms overlap and curl in a more sculptural fashion, allowed by slightly thicker lacquer.Watt and Ford, 28 (quoted); Grove By the late Yuan the reputation of individual masters has come down to us, although few pieces are signed and even these cannot be very confidently assigned to an artist, as the signatures may not be genuine. Yang Mao and Zhang Cheng were the most famous masters, both from Jiaxing in the southern province of Zhejiang.Watt and Ford, 28, 54–55, 68–69; Grove is more confident Bird and plant designs File:Circular Box with Camellias.jpgBox with Camellias, Song File:Tray (Pan) in the Form of a Plum Blossom with Birds and Flowers LACMA M.86.330 (1 of 2).jpgTray with two birds against a background of plum blossum and flowers, 19 cm wide, late Song, 13th century (oblique view).

Red over rather faded buff yellow lacquer Chinese diplomatic gifts to the Japanese government in the early Ming are especially well-documented on the Japanese side, at a time when the Ashikaga shogunate was enjoying a period of improved relations with China. In 1403 a consignment of luxury goods, also including Chinese silks and lacquered Chinese furniture, had 58 pieces of carved red lacquerware in a range of shapes. Lists with descriptions and measurements that allow some surviving pieces to be identified also survive from 1406, 1407, 1433 and 1434. These confirm that carved red lacquer was already \\"the favored type of lacquer for court use\\" by this point.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 267; Watt and Ford, 30–31 (30 quoted) Most early production of lacquer had been in the more suitable hot and moist climate of the south,Grove, \\"Qing and after (from 1644)\\"; Map in Watt and Ford, 5 but from the early Ming onwards the finest work was often from official workshops in Beijing, and the best early Ming work is \\"technically ... as near perfection as has ever been possible\\".Watt and Ford, 86 The \\"Orchard Factory\\" was founded around 1416 in Lingjing hutong in Beijing, near the Forbidden City. It used imported workers from the south, the masters from Jiaxing in Zhejiang province, and other workers from Yunnan and Sichuan.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 As part of the internal tax or tribute system, about 5,000 workers from the south were required to work in the imperial workshops for terms of four years.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 107 The raw lacquer was also imported from the south, as the Chinese lacquer tree will not grow as far north as Beijing. But the Orchard Factory closed in 1436, after only some 20 years of operations.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 The production of imperial wares seems to have lapsed between 1436 and 1522, after another Mongol invasion, from which lacquer production took longer to recover than Jingdezhen porcelain.Watt and Ford, 32 Ming table in the Victoria and Albert Museum, 1425–1436 In the Ming period the dragon became a key imperial symbol, very often appearing on lacquer from the imperial workshops for the use of the court, or made to be given by the emperor.Watt and Ford, 31–32 Initially the dragon's head was seen in the traditional profile but in the middle of the 15th century the \\"frontal\\" dragon, seen looking out full-face at the viewer, was introduced and soon became the norm in lacquer as in other media.Watt and Ford, 104 By at least the Ming dynasty carved lacquer was being used all over the visible surfaces of pieces of furniture, a dauntingly expensive proposition. One of the best known pieces is a desk-sized table with three drawers in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, whose top has a typical imperial Ming design with a central dragon and phoenix, symbolizing the emperor and empress respectively. The table-top measures 119.5 cm by 84.5 cm and it was produced between 1425–1436 in the \\"Orchard Factory\\", and is the only piece of its size to survive from their production, the best period of Ming workmanship. As with many other pieces, the ground of the relief was originally a yellow that contrasted with the red of the upper layers, but has now faded to a dark colour.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 107; Watt and Ford, 86; \\"Summary\\" and \\"More information\\" on the V&A; page on the table (use the tabs); see Garner (1966), 184–185 on yellow backgrounds Black grounds under red carved layers were also common from this period, but in some cases what now appears black may originally have been green.Watt and Ford, 92 A less common type, often of very high quality, has black upper layers on a red ground.Watt and Ford, 81–82 From about 1400, the \\"brocade-ground\\" patterns already used for floors and sky in scenes of figures in a landscape were also used in depicting plant designs, both on the backgrounds and on the leaves or fruits of the plants themselves, \\"a curious development\\". More logically, they were also used for the background of non-representational designs such as characters of Chinese script.Watt and Ford, 105 Though sometimes used earlier,\\"Cinnabar polychrome carved lacquer dish, Yuan dynasty, 14th century, China\\", A&J; Speelman polychrome carved lacquer in a variety of the tixi technique was only prominent during the period between the Jiajing Emperor and Wanli Emperor (1521–1620). This involved carving different parts of the image down to expose a layer in a different colour, so building up a coloured image.Watt and Ford, 34, 95 Landscape and figure designs File:Carved lacquer wooden box, Ming Dynasty.jpgThe palace of Chang'e, goddess of the moon, in black over red, 1490s File:Dish (Pan) in the Form of a Flower with Children Playing in a Garden LACMA M.85.153.2.jpgPan (Dish) with Children Playing in a Garden, a popular subject.

Adilnor Collection, Sweden. By the Qing period the repertoire of subjects for carved lacquer was essentially complete, but one addition in the Qianlong reign was a few pieces showing foreigners, mostly Central Asians bearing tribute though landscapes.Christies, see Lot Essays: A RARE PAIR OF LARGE CARVED FOUR-COLOR LACQUER CIRCULAR BOXES AND COVERS, Lot 591, Sale 2269, \\"Fine Chinese Ceramics & Works of Art Including Jades from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco\\", 19 March 2009, New York; A VERY RARE IMPERIAL CARVED THREE-COLOUR LACQUER FLORAL-SHAPED BOX AND COVER, Lot 1667, Sale 2389, \\"Important Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art\\", 27 November 2007, Hong Kong. Combination techniques of other techniques sometimes included carving, but more often slightly raised areas built up by applying fillers to the base surface before the lacquer was applied.Grove After the death of the Qianlong Emperor both the quality and quantity of imperial production sharply declined, and has never reached the previous standard again.Watt and Ford, 37; Grove Manufacturing process He (box) with a Scholar and Attendants in a Garden, Early Ming. About halfway-up a \\"horizon\\" can be seen as the diaper background pattern changes from water to sky. \\"Two birds\\" tray in black lacquer, Yuan (1260–1368) The lacquer, sap from the Toxicodendron vernicifluum lacquer tree that is native to China, is mixed with colourings, with the usual colours being red from cinnabar, by far the most common, black from carbon (probably Chinese ink and soot),Burmester, 178 and a yellow or buff from orpiment,Burmester, 175; \\"The conservation of Oriental lacquer\\", V&A; Conservation Journal; Cinnabar which is liable to fade to a dark colour and is often now hardly apparent. There appears to have been a change in the early Ming from using red from natural mineral cinnabar to synthetic vermilion.Burmester, 176–177; Garner (1963), 90–92 Some time after this, the colouring of the red changed from the previous brownish-red shade to a \\"bright scarlet\\", for reasons that remain unclear.Garner (1963), 93–96 The chemistry of other common pigments known to the Chinese at this period appears to have made them unsuitable for use in lacquer.Burmester, 178; Garner (1963), 90 The base is usually of wood, though other materials may be used. Often the base of flatter pieces is made of two pieces of wood glued one on top of the other, with their grains running at right angles to each other. This helps the finished piece withstand stresses from different directions. Nonetheless, early pieces often show some warping and cracking.Watt and Ford, 62–63, 70 The wood was often covered with a glued-on coarse cloth made from ramie or hemp before the lacquer was applied.Garner (1963), 87, 96–97 The base is coated with a succession of coats or layers of lacquer, each of which must be allowed to dry and harden slowly in a warm temperature of with high humidity (75% to 85%) before the next is applied.Watt and Ford, 7 The drying time for each coat has been said to take weeks,Rawson, 175 (\\"each coat taking weeks to dry and harden thoroughly\\") \\"several days\\",Garner (1963), 88 48 hours,Watt and Ford, 7 or a day.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 (\\"up to twenty-four hours\\"); Grove It has been noted that \\"there is a great diversity in the literature .... about the numbers of layers involved. Estimates ...vary between a few and over 300\\".Burmester, 176 It is often stated that the number of coats in the best quality pieces reaches into the low hundreds,Watt and Ford, 7; Rawson, 176 (\\"Chinese lacquer usually consists of hundreds of layers\\"); Grove (\\"Carved lacquerware of the early Ming had well over 100 layers of extremely thin lacquer, sometimes less than 0.05 mm thick.); Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 (\\"some of the palace items having up to one hundred layers\\"), repeated 107, specifically referring to the V&A; table; Garner (1963), 88 (\\"may exceed one hundred\\") though it has also been said that microscopic examination of pieces does not support such high numbers,Webb, 43 google books; see Garner (1963), 92–96 on the study of the layers under a microscope The lacquer is then carved with knives and other metal tools. Usually the general large areas of the composition were carved down to the right level first, then the main forms followed by the details, and lastly the patterns in the backgrounds. Finally any polishing needed is done; the best pieces had also been polished after each coat was hard. Modern works often use a number of shortcuts, including starting with carving most of the design in relief on the base wood, so greatly reducing the depth of actual lacquer required (this has been also been done in the Japanese kamakura-bori technique since around the 15th century Watt and Ford, 179 (Japan)). Additives are also added in large amounts to the lacquer, or cast resin or other materials used instead.Webb, 43; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 Nowadays there are less than 20 diaoqi masters who can still perform the craft.Today, there are probably less than 20 people who are still living with the lacquer carving skill. Probably less than 4 people who can really pass the skill to next generation.

Uses Lacquerware has been described as \\"not unlike modern plastic in that it is light, durable and clean\\".Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 Other types of lacquerware were widely used as tablewares, but the pictorial style of carved lacquer is less suitable for this, with intricate sunk corners that would be hard to clean of wet food remains. Partly for this reason, wide flattish shapes that are called dishes in other media, such as ceramics, tend to be rather more flat and to be called \\"trays\\" when in lacquer. Nonetheless there is evidence that carved lacquer was used for serving food. Ming paintings of court scenes show food for \\"imperial picnics\\" being carried by court eunuchs in round lidded boxes in carved lacquer, a common shape that can reach nearly 40 cm across.Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101; Watt and Ford, 149 The interior of these is almost always plain lacquer, greatly reducing the problem of keeping them clean, and the food itself may have been wrapped or in ceramic containers. A Yongle reign dish or tray 35 cm wide, probably made at the Orchard Factory and now in the British Museum, has a rare inscription indicating the use of the piece, as it declares it the property of the \\"Imperial Household Department of Sweetmeats and Delicacies\\".Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 102 Lacquer was more often used for cup-stands (or bowl- stands), a sort of saucer with an integral raised hollow tube at the centre to hold the cup,Watt and Ford, 86; Rawson, 176; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 267 than actual cups, but sometimes the exterior of these is carved lacquer, especially in the guri style, while the interior lacquer is smooth. As in other materials, there is a considerable overlap between the pieces used for serving and drinking tea, wine, and other drinks.

Specific episodes from the history of famous literati or literature may be intended; in paintings such subjects are likely to be made clear by inscriptions, but not on lacquer.Clunas 2, 57–69 In addition to presentation pieces, boxes in all types of lacquer were used in elite society as containers to send gifts of food, where the recipient was intended, after admiring the container, to send it back containing another gift.Kerr, 158 File:Brush (Bi) with Carp and Dragon LACMA M.80.152.1.jpgBi (Writing brush) and cap with Carp and Dragon, Middle Ming File:WLA brooklynmuseum Four Tiered Box Ming Carved Lacquer.jpgBox with four tiers, 15th century File:Official's Scepter (Ruyi) with Deer, Cranes, and a Bat LACMA M.83.89.jpgRuyi (sceptre of office) with Deer, Cranes, and a Bat (and a swastika background pattern), Qing File:Carved table at shanghai museum.jpgTable and chair set, Qing Notes  References  *Burmester, A., \\"Technical Studies of Chinese Lacquer\\", in N.

Mino castle is a very commonly used defensive formation that may be used within both Ranging Rook and Static Rook positions against both Ranging Rook and Static Rook opponents. The castle has several variants and may be the initial springboard for other further castle developments (such as the Silver Crown castle variants and the Right Fortress). Due to its popularity, several methods of attacking the Mino castle have been well studied. History The Mino castle was first developed for White in Lance handicap games by , the 10th Lifetime Meijin. The adjacent diagram shows the first recorded example of a Mino castle by Sōkan III in 1765. A major innovation was the adaption of Mino for use in even games by (1795–1839), who was a student of the 9th Lifetime Meijin, , and the second strongest historical player of his time as evaluated by today's standards. The adjacent diagrams show Ryūgetsu's first recorded example of a Mino in an even game with a Fourth File Rook position that switches to Opposing Rook with even a development into a High Mino castle a few moves later. Development Mino castle is a defensive position that is considered easier for beginners but still popular with professionals. (Mino is a historical province of Japan.) The king is placed in a safe position on the 28 square (or the 82 square if used for White) while the three generals work well to back each other up. A Mino castle is often used when a player chooses a Ranging Rook. However, it is also possible to build a Mino castle on the left side of the board with a Static Rook position as well. There are many variants of Mino. A Mino castle can be used as is, but it is very common for the basic Mino castle to be developed into one of its variants, which are chosen depending on the opponent's formation. It is also possible that a Mino castle can transition into a different castle such as a Right Fortress castle. =Basic Ranging Rook Mino= The Mino castle takes five steps to complete, not necessarily in this order: # Move the rook to the left side of the board. This move is almost always first in Ranging Rook Minos. # Move the king to where the rook started, three moves. # Move the right-side silver up one space, so it is now adjacent to the king. # Move the left-side gold diagonally up and right so that it is protected by the other gold general, which has not moved. # (Optional) Move the first file edge pawn one square forward. This move, known as 懐 tokoro \\"(king's) inside pocket,\\" gives the king an escape route in the endgame. There are two major considerations in move order with respect to moving the king. The first pattern moves the king before moving the right silver via K-48, K-38, K-28 (and thereafter, S-38). The second pattern moves the right silver up via S-38 preventing K-38, which gives a king movement path of K-48, K-39, K-28. This first pattern of moving the king to 28 in a straight path keeps open the possibility of constructing an Anaguma castle (with L-18, K-19) as well as a Mino (with S-38). The second pattern prevents an Anaguma development since the Anaguma requires S-28, but it does allow the 38-silver and the 49-gold to mutually defend each other immediately as well as giving the king a relatively safer resting spot after 3 moves on the 39 square, and also, this may be vulnerable to bishop drops on 28. Furthermore, in modern shogi against a Static Rook position, the preferred order (as in the Fujii System) is to push the edge pawn (P-16) and build the castle first (with S-38 and G69-58) before moving the king. If the Static Rook opponent chooses an Anaguma castle (which takes several moves to construct), then a Ranging Rook player has the option of using a rapid attack strategy while leaving the king on its initial square. If Static Rook chooses one of the rapid attack strategies himself, then Ranging Rook will start moving their king into the Mino castle.  Mino game examples  The first adjacent diagram shows a July 2009 Asahi Cup game between Norihiro Yagura (Black) and Takayuki Yamasaki (White). Black is playing Third File Rook, Normal (closed bishop diagonal) variation while White is playing Static Rook. After moving his rook to the Third File Rook position (R-78) and making other offensive and defensive developments on the left side of the board, Black moves his king to its castle position via 5.K-48, 6.K-38, ... 8.K-28. After moving his king, Black then constructs the intermediate Incomplete Mino castle with 9.S-38. After more attacking piece development, Black completes his Mino castle with 14.G69-58 and opens an escape hatch for the king with 15.P-16. White's castle is still being developed into an Anaguma castle – at this stage, an Incomplete Anaguma.https://shogidb2.com/games/ddb926ee9497ab94d2449a7f59393c9c1596cb73 The first adjacent diagram shows a November 1993 Ryūō game between Katsuhiko Murooka (Black) and Takeshi Fujii (White). White is playing a Fourth File Rook, Fujii System variation against Black's Static Rook. White is using a Mino castle with the left pawn edge pushed (P-94) and the sixth file pawn advanced (in preparation for a High Mino castle development). His king has moved to the 71 square where it remained for several moves. The second diagram shows further development of White's Mino castle into a High Mino castle with the left gold fully developed to the 63 square and an advanced knight on the 73 square (for attacking purposes) as well as an advanced eighth file pawn (P-84) while his king still remains on the 71 square. Black is using a Boat castle which eventually developed into another Mino castle variant, Castle Tower Mino (see below).https://shogidb2.com/games/a248e84e8e46737aad7f612db03dab677e567ad5 =Incomplete Mino= Incomplete Mino or Half Mino (片美濃 kata Minō) is a Mino with the leftmost gold is missing. This is commonly seen as a transitional state when building a regular Mino since the leftmost gold is usually the last piece to move in the formation sequence. However, an Incomplete Mino is also built for strategies (such as Opposing Rook) that use the gold on the other side of the board (near where the rook is initially positioned). Another case is in Central Rook when the gold cannot move to the square that the rook is on (on 58 or on 52 for White).  Incomplete Mino game examples  The first examples show the use of an Incomplete Mino castle as stepping stone to building the regular Mino. Here Yoshiyuki Kubota (Black) is playing Fourth File Rook against Kōichi Fukaura (White) who is using a Static Rook position.https://shogidb2.com/games/d4a46df5c57b2e6b569000eb23d081b7f13dad96 After making an early declaration of a Fourth File Rook opening, Black starts his castle development by moving his king with 3.K-48 and preparing an escape path for the king with 4.P-16. And, since White did not respond with a complementary first file pawn push, Black pushes his edge pawn once more with 5.P-15 putting pressure on White and restricting White's castle development to what will probably be an Anaguma (since a Boat or Mino castle with a rapid attack strategy is now unlikely for White). Next, Black moves his king rightward in a straight path to its castled position on the second file with 6.K-38, 7.K-28 as shown in the second diagram. After this, Black makes several developing moves on the left side of the board toward his Fourth File Rook, Normal variation position. And then, with 10.S-38 Black has constructed an Incomplete Mino castle to protect his king. Since the Incomplete Mino castle is only a transitional castle in this game, after making more offensive developments on the left side of the board, Black finally converts his Incomplete Mino castle into a Mino castle with 14.G69-58 as shown in the fourth diagram. White at this point has completed a Boat castle and appears to be transitioning this into an Anaguma as expected. =High Mino= The High Mino (高美濃 taka Minō) castle is a natural development from Mino castle when wanting to put pressure on a Static Rook opponent's castle or when being attacked from above as in a Double Ranging Rook game. Compared to a regular Mino, it allows the player a greater potential for offense on the right side of the board and is stronger at the top although somewhat weaker from the side. It is developed from Mino by pushing the 4th file pawn up to 46 to make way for the gold that moves from 58. This strengthens the castle against attacks from the front by reinforcing the king's temple, the 37 square, from a bishop attack or defends from a knight being positioned on 55 also attacking the king's temple. P-46 also makes way for a gold to develop to 47 (a 'high' position) for the characteristic High Mino shape. Another variation of the High Mino form is having the 37 pawn also move up to 36 to allow space for the knight. Moving the knight to 37 is optional but common. It is also possible to advance the fifth file pawn, which is defended by the 46 gold. =Silver Mino= A Silver Mino (銀美濃 gin minō) castle replaces the leftmost gold of a regular Mino castle with a silver. When the leftmost silver is moved up from 58 to 47 as like the gold in a High Mino castle, this is also known as a Silver Mino. In this variant, the 38 is defended better, but the 58 square is now weaker. As with the regular Mino, it's also standard to make an escape hatch for the king by advancing the first file pawn. =Silver Crown= The Silver Crown castle (銀冠, ginkanmuri) is often a further development from High Mino. From a High Mino structure, the pawn above the king moves to 26 allowing the silver to position itself at the head of the king (27). Then, the gold on 49 moves to 38 to take the silver's former square. It is also typical for the knight to advance. Silver Crown is stronger than both Mino and High Mino from above. Silver Crown can develop the king and lance appears in the endgame when the king escapes to 17, forming a third-rank king castle. This is useful against attacks from behind the king. For example, in the diagram to the left, black can move the lance to 18. If the rook promotes on 19 and checks, the king can escape to 17. Then, if the second rook promotes on 29 (aiming to take the gold on 38), moving the gold from 47 to 48 can protect the gold on 38, and prevent mate. Silver Crown variants A Silver Crown can also be built on the left side (Left Silver Crown 左銀冠 hidari ginkanmuri) for Static Rook positions. A Left Silver Crown may also transition into a Left Silver Crown Anaguma (居飛車銀冠穴熊 ibisha ginkanmuri anaguma). An Edge King Silver Crown (端玉銀冠 hashi gyoku ginkanmuri or hashi gyoku ginkan) has the king moved to the edge file. It is structurally similar to the Yonenaga King castle. =Kimura Mino= Yoshio Kimura The Kimura Mino (木村美濃 kimura minō) castle was invented by player Yoshio Kimura. In this variant, a gold 金 is positioned on 38 where the silver 銀 usually is and the silver is positioned where the gold usually is in a High Mino castle. A Kimura Mino can be used with a Central Rook Silver Horns (ツノ銀中飛車 tsuno gin nakabisha) attacking formation. =Left Mino= Left Mino or Reverse Mino (左美濃 hidari minō) can be formed in a similar way to the right-side Mino with the king on 88. Castle Tower Mino There is also a common Left Mino variant known as Tower Mino (天守閣美濃 tenshukaku minō) that positions the king above the bishop's head, which allows the king to stay out of the diagonal of the opponent's bishop as shown to the right. Another reason for this 87 king position is because it is faster to create: the usual right- side Mino castle has the king positioned on the second file from the edge. However, on the left side this position is occupied by the bishop, so extra moves are required to move the bishop out of the king's way.

The cave passage is mostly a two to three foot wide fissure that follows a stream downward through over 40 rappels. In 2014 a team of nine cavers explored new passage pushing the cave to a depth of 1629 feet and in doing so passed New Mexico's Lechuguilla Cave to become the deepest known limestone cave in the United States. Exploration continued in 2016 when teams returned to push the cave to its current known depth of 1659 feet. On those trips the difficulty necessitated establishing camp in the cave for the first time. This, along with the technical rope work, 39 degree temperature, and remote location of the cave make continued exploration difficult. A return trip is currently planned for 2019.

The Ashram runs a charitable hospital, a senior secondary boy's high school, a library beside other charitable works. History The founder of kanpur \\"Ramakrishna seva sadan\\" (off late known as Ram Krishna mission Ashram) was, \\"Nepal maharaj\\", Popularly known as \\"Nepalda\\" alias \\"Master moshai\\".He was a revolutionary too. His family name was \\" Shri. Nepaleshwar Banerjee\\". He settled in Kanpur along with his two younger brothers, \\"Gangadhar Banerjee\\" a renounced architect and civil engineer, (very popularly known as Gangada. And the youngest brother \\"Shri. Khagendra Nath Banerjee (a technocrat) popularly known as Khagen babu. At a stone throw distance to the R.K.Mission ashram at R.K.Nagar Kanpur, Gangadhar babu constructed their residential house at 110/204, G.T.Road, R.K.Nagar. Nepal maharaja was the only founder of Kanpur Ram Krishna Seva sadan and he was the founder Secretary of Kanpur Ram Krishna mission and no one else as claimed by some other people. The Ashrama at Kanpur started modestly at Raja Manzil, Birana Road, in the 1920s. The Ashrama was called ‘Ramakrishna Seva Sadan’ and Srimat Swami Vijnanananda, a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, first visited this group. With the increase of activities, Ramakrishna Seva Sadan was moved to a new address at Aga Kothi, Ram Narayan Bazar, and was affiliated to the Headquarters at Belur Math in 1931. The Ashrama was now officially ‘Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama’. Location The Ashrama was transferred then to a new place in Raja Manjil of Ram Narayan Bazar. In 1931, it got affiliation to Belur Math. Owing to financial constraints, the Ashrama was shifted first to Anwarganj, and, then to the present site on 13 August 1937 in Gumti No. 5 on the piece of land measuring 1.5 acres, donated by Kanpur Improvement Trust. The locality in which Ashrama is situated, was later on named ‘Ramakrishna Nagar’. Activities * Govt. Aided Senior Secondary High School for boys - The Ashrama used to run a School named ‘Vivekananda Vidyapith’ in a small dilapidated building. In 1947, construction started on a new building just across the main campus, and this became the Ramakrishna Mission School. In 1983-4, because of its continuous outstanding performance in academics, the School was designated ‘Best School’ by the Uttar Pradesh State Government. At present the Senior Secondary High School is affiliated to the U.P. Board having 800 students. The medium of instruction is Hindi. The Ashrama also conducts Free Coaching for poor students in the evening. *Charitable Medical Dispensary - Responding to the health needs of the poor, the Ashrama started a charitable dispensary in a small ramshackle room. It later became known as ‘Baba ka hospital, Hospital of the sadhus’. Today, the Ashrama has Allopathic as well as Homeopathic sections.

In 2014, the U.S. Department of State cited Ecuador's corruption as a key human-rights problem. According to Freedom House, “Ecuador has long been racked by corruption” and the weak judicial oversight and investigative resources perpetuate a culture of impunity. According to one report, “institutionalized graft has become a driving force” of Ecuador's economy, and that this graft “is flourishing in a vacuum of transparency or accountability.” The same report indicated that “the entire business class of Guayaquil” owns offshore bank accounts. David Rosero, a member of the opposition party and Ecuador's Council for Citizen Participation, has said that $2 billion is lost every year to corruption. Indicators Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 120th place out of 176 countries. A 2014 report by the Organization of American States urged the Ecuadoran Prosecutor’s Office to remove barriers to processing corruption complaints and prosecutions. Background President Rafael Correa with Bolivian president Evo Morales When Rafael Correa took office as president in 2007, he announced a “revolution against corruption.” Only five weeks into his tenure, Correa undermined the Civic Anti-Corruption Commission, formed in 1998, by establishing the National Anticorruption Secretariat, which gave public officials the job of investigating the corruption of public officials. Ten months later, he abolished the commission entirely and replaced it with the Council for Citizen Participation and Social Control. This council, which was entirely under his personal control, was placed above the National Anticorruption Secretariat and diluted its powers. During its first six years, the Secretariat reportedly refused to say how many corruption complaints it had processed. In 2011, the Secretariat stated that it was aware of 1412 active cases, 442 within the Secretariat's jurisdiction and 970 under the jurisdiction of other government sectors, and that there was also a three-year backlog of 3,500 cases. According to one source, the Council for Citizen Participation does not, in practice, actually investigate corruption charges. Moreover, it has had the power since 2009 to appoint the Attorney General and other top government officials, and its appointees have included persons accused of corruption, such as Attorney General Galo Chiriboga, who was charged with forgery. A 2011 referendum approved constitutional changes to increase Correa's powers over media and the judiciary The vote temporarily replaced the Judicial Council, an independent body that appointed, promoted, and fired judges, with a transition council appointed partly by the president, which fired scores of judges in August and September 2011. In 2013, Correa instituted something called the National Plan for the Prevention and Fight Against Corruption 2013-2017, which has been called “a complete nonstarter\\" by critics. Government President Correa meets with former Secretary Hillary Clinton Observers have characterized Ecuador's government as lacking any transparency. It is alleged that Ecuadoran officials engage in corruption with impunity. Many officials have been accused of corruption and never been cleared, or have undergone “unconvincing trials” at the end of which they go unpunished. Leading officials who have been at the center of corruption scandals in recent years have included Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño; Pedro Delgado, a cousin of the president; and Patricio Pazmiño, President of the Constitutional Court, who despite corruption charges was appointed to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. In 2008, Sports Minister Raul Carrion was accused of illegal enrichment and was charged with twelve counts of embezzlement. In 2014, the Riobamba mayor, Juan Salazar Lopez, stole over USD 13 million from the city's bank account. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for embezzlement. In 2015, Congressmember Maria Esperanza Galván was arrested for requesting an $800,000 bribe from a company in exchange for public contracts from her district. Correa blamed opposition-party members of the Council for Citizen Participation of not fighting corruption adequately. Correa's older brother Fabricio, an engineer and president of Aplitec SA, is alleged to have received government contracts on which he collected about $700 million and overcharged by about $140 million. Fabricio sued the journalists who broke the story, and the president, who claimed he was unaware of the contracts, formed a special commission to investigate the case. When the commission concluded, in February 2011, that the president had known about the contracts, the president sued four members of the commission, two of whom ended up being charged with perjury by the Attorney General, who is also Correa's cousin. In the end, those two commission members were found guilty of perjury and imprisoned. The so-called Panama Papers that were leaked in April 2016 showed that Correa and his brother owned an offshore company that was apparently being used for corrupt purposes. The Panama Papers also showed that the Attorney General “used offshore accounts to buy houses and properties.” Public access to official information is officially guaranteed, yet this guarantee is not enforced. = Presidency of Rafael Correa = In 2016, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (OHCHR) ruled that the former Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa violated the civil rights of two prominent bankers, Roberto and William Isaias. Correa’s government confiscated the brothers’ businesses, which included one of the most successful banks in the country, and did not afford the two brothers any due process. OHCHR ordered Ecuador to fully restore the seized properties to the Isaias brothers. The ruling brings to light the depth of Correa’s corruption and abuse of power. After seizing their businesses, Correa even went so far as to pass an amendment to the country’s constitution openly directed at the Isaias men. The amendment (Mandate No. 13) made it expressly illegal for the brothers to file legal actions. It also said that any judge who even heard such a case would be dismissed. OHCHR ruled that Mandate No. 13 violated Isaias’ rights. = Government-led demise of Filanbanco = In 2010, author and professor Alberto Valencia Granada published a book called When Success is a Crime: Filanbanco: A Case of Violation of Human Rights in Ecuador. In the book, Valencia examines Ecuador’s financial crisis of 1998–1999 and the subsequent actions by the Ecuadorian state to seize the Isaias family’s businesses and persecute Roberto Isaias and William Isaias for false charges stemming from a false narrative that the brothers had caused the economic crisis through their bank, Filanbanco.https://www.amazon.com/When-Success-Crime-Violation- Ecuador/dp/1514220741 =Judiciary= The Ecuadoran judiciary is allegedly subject to political interference, bribery, and other forms of corruption. Judges do not act independently, and judicial proceedings can be lengthy, confusing, and inconclusive. The system is compromised by the fact that the Judicial Council, the judiciary's governing body, is run by an intimate of Correa's, Gustavo Jalkh, who was the president's private secretary. “Corruption, inefficiency, and political influence have plagued the Ecuadorian judiciary for many years,” stated Human Rights Watch in 2012. In 2011 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights accused Ecuador of violating the due process of 27 Supreme Court justices dismissed by Congress in 2004. In 2015, U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) stated that “judicial independence is seriously compromised” in Ecuador. U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled in 2014 that an $18 billion pollution judgment against Chevron by an Ecuadoran court in 2011 had been the product of corruption. Attorney Steven Donziger and his legal team, according to Kaplan, had “used bribery, fraud and extortion” to win the case for his clients, a group of Ecuadoran villagers. Evidence showed that the ruling issued by Ecuadoran judge Nicolas Zambrano had in fact been copied word for word from internal documents held by the plaintiff's lawyers. Kaplan's decision blocked the plaintiffs from collecting the award in the U.S. In outtakes from a film submitted to the court by Chevron, Danziger was shown saying that in Ecuador, “there are a thousand people around the courthouse; you will get whatever you want,” his point being that many courthouse employees were prepared to take bribes in exchange for a favorable verdict. =Police= Ecuador's police has been accused of corruption. In 2008, after the U.S. Embassy in Quito concluded that then commander of the National Police, Jaime Aquilino Hurtado, had “used his power...to extort, accumulating money and property, facilitate human trafficking, and obstruct investigations against corrupt peers,” the U.S. State Department revoked U.S. the entry visas of Hurtado and his family. These alleged corrupt activities began before Hurtado was named commander, and U.S. authorities believed that Correa was aware of them when he appointed Hurtado to that position. The help Hurtado gave to human traffickers was believed to have enabled criminals and terrorists to enter the U.S. Among Hurtado's accomplices was a police chief, Bolivar Villota, whom he hired to develop a resort he owned. Villota was arrested in 2007 for extortion but Hurtado managed to keep him in office. Two other police officers, Milton Raul Andrade and Manuel Fernando Basantes, were found to be involved in smuggling immigrants, mostly Chinese, into the U.S. Hurtado, who was also a part of this racket, protected those officers, too. =Customs= Ecuador's customs system has been criticized by the Business Anti Corruption Portal as highly corrupt, especially when importing rather than exporting, and irregular payments are common. =Public services= According to the Business Anti Corruption Portal, the public services sector suffers from major corruption, marked by bribery and facilitation payments. Burdensome regulations and inefficient bureaucracy abound. =Public procurement= Ecuador's public procurement sector is also accused of corruption, with a high level of favoritism and kickbacks, and with funds often being diverted irregularly to connected companies and individuals, according to a report by the Business Anti Corruption Portal. The major recent public-procurement case during the Correa years involved the awarding of government contracts worth $167 million to Correa's brother Fabricio. =National resources sector= The natural resources sector supposedly involves a rather high risk of illegal activity. The extractive industries, which make up more than half of Ecuador's exports, have been characterized by a lack of transparency in regard to money and environmental impact data. A June 2016 report indicated that Ecuador's government-owned oil firm, Petroecuador, was the center of “a thriving culture of corruption” involving “oil executives, middlemen, and government officials,” who were enriching themselves through illegal “commissions” on oil being shipped to PetroChina in exchange for loans and credit. “The China-Ecuador loan deals,” noted the report, “have created a climate of corruption on all sides.” =Taxation= Ecuador's tax system can reportedly make it difficult to do business in the country. The system has been considered untrustworthy, the tax laws change frequently, many companies evade taxes, and filing taxes is unusually time- consuming. =Property rights= Although Ecuadoran law guarantees property rights, in practice they are often unprotected, and the government is alleged to threaten embargo or nationalization to pressure companies. =NGOs= Correa has been accused of seeking to increase his power over domestic and international NGOs. He expanded the executive's authority over them in a 2011 presidential degree, and shortly afterwards used his new authority to expel 16 foreign NGOs from the country. Media In 2014, the Superintendency of Information and Communication (SUPERCOM) ordered changes in a cartoon in El Universo criticizing government corruption, and fined the newspaper as well. Businesses are reported to avoid association with opposition media for fear of government reprisals. Business Corruption has been reported as a major problem for businesses investing in Ecuador. The public services and procurement sectors are characterized by endemic corruption, with bribery and “facilitation payments” being widespread, according to the Business Anti Corruption Portal. About a third of Ecuadoran companies are not registered, and thus operate outside regulatory framework, which exacerbates corruption. =Petty corruption= In 2016, Kathleen Peddicord wrote in U.S. News that small-scale corruption is widespread in Ecuador. “I've been short-changed in Ecuador dozens of times over the years,” she wrote. “Each time, the wrong change was politely explained as an honest mistake, but the mistake has never been in my favor. On the other hand, in Uruguay, Chile and Colombia, I've never been short-changed in all the years I've spent time in those countries.” Anti-corruption efforts Ecuador has many laws against corruption and several bodies that are tasked with fighting it, but these laws and bodies are criticized as having been weakened during the Correa presidency, with only a tiny percentage of Ecuadorans consider the government's anti-corruption agencies effective. Officially, bribing government employees, influence peddling, embezzlement, illicit enrichment, and extortion are banned by the Comprehensive Organic Criminal Code, Chapter 5, section 3, and by the Ecuadorian Constitution. The Constitution requires Ecuadorans to report acts of corruption. Laws are technically in place to sanction public officials who request or receive gifts, privileges, or advantages with their power. The Comptroller General and other government entities are empowered to probe and prosecute cases of corruption involving public contracts. The Criminal Code, passed in 2014, contains anti-corruption language. Both this code and the Ecuadorian Constitution (article 233) criminalize bribery, influence peddling, embezzlement, and illegal enrichment and extortion. Facilitation payments are banned under article 280 of the Criminal Code. Bribery is punishable under that article by up to seven years in prison. Under article 278, embezzlement is punishable by up to 13 years and by a lifetime ban on seeking public office. Under articles 285 and 286, influence peddling is punishable by three to five years. Under article 279, unlawful enrichment is punishable by up to 10 years. Under article 281, extortion is punishable by up to seven years. Corporations are not subject to punishment for corruption. The Public Prosecutor’s Office is in charge of enforcing anti-corruption laws and prosecuting corruption. The Comptroller General controls, supervises, and audits acts by government employees, and in principle has the power to remove and sanction corrupt individuals and report them to the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The Counsel of Citizen Participation and Social Control is tasked with promoting transparency, investigating corruption, and requesting judicial actions against corrupt individuals. The Counsel exercises its anti-corruption efforts through the Secretariat for Transparency and Fight against Corruption. The Technical Secretariat for Transparency Management coordinates and executes transparency policies in the executive branch, and “create[s] strategies for investigating, processing and reporting corruption issues to the relevant public entities.” There is a Law for the Control of Money Laundering and there are financial disclosure laws as well. There are no laws against bribing foreign officials. Ecuador has ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) and the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC), though it has not enacted the chief requirements of the IACAC. In addition, Ecuador is a participant in the Andean Plan of Action Against Corruption. In December 2014, Ecuador, along with other Latin American and Caribbean countries, issued the Quito Declaration, which emphasized the importance of combatting corruption more seriously. Ecuador has also signed reciprocal corruption-fighting agreements with Belgium, Cuba, Mexico, and other countries.

He is the co-founder with Paula Swain and Harry Rhoads Jr. of Washington Speakers Bureau,Washington Speakers Bureau a lecture agency which represents many prestigious authors, politicians, journalists, athletes, and business leaders.  Early life and education  Bernie Swain was the first in his family to attend college. His mother and her family were farmers who grew up in central Virginia. His father, with six siblings, grew up in the poorest of mining towns in a West Virginia. When his grandmother could not always take care of his father, he spent part of his childhood in an orphanage. Inspired by a teacher, John C. Youngblood, Bernie attended George Washington University earning a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Education.  Professional life  After graduation, Swain worked as the assistant athletics director at George Washington. In 1980 he came across an article about the Harry Walker Agency, which was at the time the largest speakers bureau in the world. Swain's interest was piqued by founder Harry Walker's claim that he had no competitors. Swain left his job to found the Washington Speakers Bureau with his wife Paula and friend Harry Rhoads. Business was slow the first year, in part because Walker's claim about a lack of competition in the speakers bureau business was false. Washington Speakers Bureau signed its first client, Good Morning America anchor Steve Bell, on a handshake. Other journalists began to sign with the agency, attracted by the ability to work with them without signing a contract. In 1989, former President Ronald Reagan selected Washington Speakers Bureau to represent him. More prestigious clients soon followed, including Margaret Thatcher, General Norman Schwarzkopf, and President George H.W. Bush.  Publications  In 2016 Savio Hill published Swain's book What Made Me Who I Am, a collection of interviews with 34 successful leaders Swain met through Washington Speakers Bureau. The book explores the formative experiences and turning points in the lives of its subjects. People featured in the book include Tom Brokaw, Colin Powell, Terry Bradshaw, and Condoleezza Rice. Swain published an article in the Harvard Business Review in September 2016, \\"Successful Leaders Know What Made Them Who They Are\\". He has been covered by The Washington Post, Fortune magazine, Entrepreneur magazine, WNYC's Brian Lehrer show, and more.

It was served by the Union Pacific Railroad from its 1901 construction to 1971, and Amtrak from 1971–1983 and 1991–1997. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993, as the Union Pacific Railroad Depot. History The San Francisco Zephyr at Rawlins in June 1983, shortly before it was rerouted as the California Zephyr The station was built in 1901 to a design by the Union Pacific's engineering department. The one-story brick structure is a typical railroad depot, with a rectangular plan paralleling the railroad tracks, a hipped roof and a projecting bay affording a view up and down the line. The Rawlins depot is larger than most, with brick in lieu of frame construction, and extra detailing in the form of projecting hipped bays, an entrance tower and stepped gables. It measures by with deep bracketed overhangs under the flared hipped roof. The depot's interior housed separate men's and women's waiting rooms, toilets, a lobby and a ticket desk along with a telegraph office and a freight office. The public spaces were entered under a low tower structure. A neighboring 1916 structure called the Eating House housed a dining room and kitchen, connected to the main building by an arcade. After a fire in the 1920s the Eating House was converted to offices. The interior of the main depot was remodeled in the 1940s and was stripped of much of its woodwork. with Amtrak took over intercity service on May 1, 1971, with its City of San Francisco running until June 1972, when it was replaced by the San Francisco Zephyr. The California Zephyr replaced the San Francisco on a more southern route on July 16, 1983, ending passenger rail service to Rawlins. The interior was subsequently converted entirely to office use. Amtrak service was restored with the rerouting of the Pioneer via Rawlins on June 17, 1991. In the 1990s the depot was given by the Union Pacific Railroad to the city of Rawlins. It is used as a community center. The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1993. Amtrak service ended for a second time on May 10, 1997, when the Pioneer was discontinued.

Known in Mexico as Queen of the Blues  Biography  Betsy Pecanins was born to a Catalan mother and an American father and grew up in an art-conscious family. For example, her mother Ana María Pecanins and her aunt Teresa founded the Galería Pecanins art gallery in Mexico City and Barcelona. She spent her first years in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. In 1977 she emigrated to Mexico to pursue her artistic career, where she settled. In 1980 she recorded her first album, Viendo tus ojos. Throughout her career she suffered the consequences of the culture of machismo prevalent in Mexico, and the lack of belief in a woman being able to be a credible musician in her own right. The musical style of Pecanins was described by blues singer Papa John Creach as \\"unique. You must have black blood hidden in your body,\\" he commented to her. Her music was employed in such films as; La reina de la noche (about the singer Lucha Reyes, where she performed the soundtrack), Hasta morir, Dos crímenes, Cilantro y perejil and Asesino en serio. On August 29, 2015, she received a tribute to her artistic career at Teatro de la Ciudad Esperanza Iris in Mexico City, where singers such as Iraida Noriega and Regina Orozco participated, among others. Pecanins had stayed away from the stages until that date due to complications caused by the spasmodic dysphonia affecting her vocal cords. Pecanins died of a stroke at the age of 62 on December 13, 2016.

The species is endemic to East Asia. E. ijimae feeds exclusively on the eggs of coral reef fishes, which makes them an important predator for maintaining a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Etymology The specific name, ijimae, is in honor of Japanese zoologist Isao Ijima (1861–1921).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Emydocephalus ijimae, p. 129). Geographic range E. ijimae is found on the coasts of China, Japan (including the Ryukyu Islands), and Taiwan.  Sex & Growth  E. ijimae exhibit sexual size dimorphism with males reaching a snout-vent length (SVL) typically less than 750 mm and females sometimes exceeding 800 mm. Females also have a larger body weight ranging from 170 to 600 g compared to the male that weighs in at 70 to 350 g. The female BW also experiences greater fluctuations than males. Adult males typically see an increase in BW from early spring to late summer and females occasionally undergo a rapid BW decrease from late autumn to early spring followed by a steady weight regain. SVL in newborn E. ilijmae is between 266 mm and 342 mm. Neonate males have been reported to grow 0.27 mm/day while neonate females grow 0.36 mm/day. The snakes reach maturity around the same age. Between 19-28 months for males and 19-26 months for females. Reproduction E. ijimae is viviparous. Neonates begin reproductive activity in the second or third summer and third spring after birth. Studies have suggested that E. ijimae are income breeders that rely on temporal energy intake to produce offspring.

During his career for the American government he completed 109 paintings depicting historic transportation methods in the United States. Early life and education Rakeman was a native Washingtonian (D.C.) born to German-American artist Joseph Rakeman. He was educated at the Corcoran Art School and art academies in Düsseldorf, Munich, and Paris. His art expression was not confined to any one medium. He was an etcher and a painter in watercolors, oils, and frescoes. He also worked in the field of mural decoration. Career A painting by Rakeman, that depicts the construction of the first macadamized road in the United States (1823).

During his career BPR, he painted exhibits for the Good Roads meetings, state fairs, and expositions such as the Brazilian Exposition (1922), the Century of Progress in Chicago (1933), an Overseas Exposition in Paris, the Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco (1939) and the New York World's Fair (1940). In addition, he completed the series of 109 paintings depicting historic American roads, trails, and highways. Mr. Rakeman early in his career was singled out by E. F. Andrews, founder and first director of the Corcoran School of Art (and an established artist in the District of Columbia), as the most qualified artist to copy the White House portraits of President and Mrs. Hayes, referring to him as \\"a young man of great talent.\\" It was his first commission. =Corpus= Important Rakeman works can be seen in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere throughout the country, such as in the U.S. Soldiers Home (Tennessee), the Ohio State House (Columbus), and the Hayes Memorial Museum (President Rutherford B. Hayes' home), Fremont, Ohio. He is extremely well represented at the latter, having worked continually for Colonel and Mrs. Hayes, painting numerous portraits of the entire Hayes family, and also restoring fine old paintings already hanging in the former President's home. Among his most notable works are his murals in Washington, particularly the one adjoining the Senate Committee Room on Appropriations in the Capitol. The ceiling was frescoed by Constantino Brumidi, the highly regarded Italian-American artist. However, the lunettes over the windows, doorway, and fireplace were not decorated, and this work was placed in the hands of Carl Rakeman. In each lunette Mr. Rakeman placed the portrait of a famous American general: George Washington, Anthony Wayne, Joseph Warren, and Horatio Gates. He framed each with an oval laurel wreath. Flanking each of the portraits are flags of the Colonial period, draped over contemporary helmets and arms. It is the only design in the Capitol showing the Colonial flags. Retirement Mr. Rakeman retired from the Bureau of Public Roads in 1952, and died at the age of 87, in 1965, at Fremont, Ohio.

It was initially isolated from patients in Colombia and two key patients in Panama. Two individual serotypes of PTV were isolated from these patients, PTV-Adames (A) and PTV-Balliet (B), with PTV-A appearing to be more virulent. PTV is considered to be relatively contained to the Americas with no cases being reported outside of this region. Along with a few other human pathogenic Phleboviruses, PTV is considered to be a significant virus in terms of public health as little information is known about its clinical effects and with further research underway, PTV could have unforeseen impacts on health and virology.  Structure  As a member of the order Bunyavirales, PTV possesses many of the type virus structural characteristics. PTV has a helical nucleocapsid as well as an outer envelope. On the viral envelope PTV has two major glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, that function in host-cell binding and entry. Within the genus Phlebovirus, these glycoproteins form a characteristic icosahedral lattice with a triangulation number of T=12. Due to this structure, PTV appears as a relatively spherical particle when viewed in an electron micrograph with a diameter from 80 to 120 nm.http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/252.html  Genome  The genome structure of PTV is negative sense, linear segmented RNA genome. The genome consists of three individual segments or varying length: S (1.7kb), M (3.2kb), and L (6.4kb) that encode for a total of six viral proteins. In terms of gene expression, PTV operates by using a strong hairpin sequence on the terminal end of each segment, coupled with the use of ambisense for the S segment and leaky scanning for the M segment. The process of transcription takes place in the host cell cytoplasm with the use of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and enters replication after enough nucleoprotein has built up to form new intact virus particles.  Clinical  PTV is a member of the phlebotomus fever subgroup of Phleboviruses, and as the name suggests, causes an acute febrile illness. Acute febrile illness in humans is characterized by a rapid onset of fever that is often accompanied by secondary symptoms such as a headache, chills, myalgias and arthralgias. This illness will last for about 2–5 days and is not considered to be highly virulent in humans, however, testing in Syrian hamsters has revealed high virulence for the PTV-A serotype and a low virulence for the PTV-B serotype. Although relatively low numbers of human infection with this virus have been reported, the virus is of public health interest and further research will need to be conducted.

Description The house was built in 1908 for Mrs. Lydia M. Willis in Encampment, Wyoming as a house of prostitution and the headquarters for her family's business network. Mrs. Willis had previously operated a similar business in Encampment in a house next to her husband's saloon. The Willises managed a number of similar operations, with two brothels in Rawlins, one each in Saratoga and Encampment, and probably one in Rock Springs. Mr. Willis bred race horses and managed saloons. The house is notable as one of the most prominent houses in Encampment and the only masonry house in town. with The Willis House is described as a modified American Foursquare of two stories, built in molded concrete block. The house is fronted by a masonry-pillared porch on the short west side, with a half-story elevation above with deep flared eaves and a clipped gable. The interior detailing is somewhat plain. The upper level was subdivided into five rooms suited for the planned use, three of which have bed alcoves. All share a single toilet. The property includes a log barn to the rear. History Lydia M. Propst was born in about 1846 in Pendleton County, Virginia (now West Virginia). Following the death of her husband Edward after the American Civil War Lydia and her son Lee, another son and a daughter moved to Rawlins around 1886, where she married S.L. (Jerry) Willis. The Willises settled in Encampment, which was near the center of the Grand Encampment copper mining boom of the early 20th century, with a ready supply of miners seeking entertainment. The Willises traveled throughout Colorado and Wyoming, starting a number of businesses, many involving prostitution. Extensive correspondence has been preserved documenting Mrs. Willis's business and her relationship with her girls. Despite their business activities, which occasioned editorial complaints in the town newspaper, Mr. Willis was Encampment Justice of the Peace in 1915 and Town Marshal in 1916. The end of the copper boom in Encampment apparently caused the house to remain largely unfinished within, and the Willises left Encampment sometime between 1916 and Lydia's 1926 death in Brighton, Colorado. Her son Lee operated a gas station in Encampment until his death in 1941. The house changed hands 18 times before 1931, until it was purchased by rancher, merchant and miner Charles Deo Terwilliger. Terwilliger had made his fortune in Nevada by selling supplies to miners. After some setbacks to his ranching business he and his wife Laura bought the Willis House for $800 in 1931, adapting the house as a boarding house for teachers. The house remained in the hands of Terwilliger's descendants into the 21st century. The Willis House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 29, 2001.

It is a shrub with hairy, glandular stems, stalkless, flat leaves and fragrant, off-white, bell-like flowers with purple stripes inside the tube. Description Pityrodia byrnesii is a shrub which grows to a height of about and which has its branches densely covered with glands and hairs. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three along the branches and are long, wide. They are sticky due to glandular secretions, smooth on top with a distinct mid-rib on the lower surface. pdf The flowers are fragrant and are arranged singly on a sticky, hairy stalk less than long. The flowers are surrounded by leaf-like bracts and bracteoles which are oblong to lance-shaped, long and wide. The sepals are long and joined to form a bell-shaped tube with five lance-shaped lobes on the end. The lobes are lance-shaped, long, hairy and sticky outside, and hairy inside. The tube is and sticky and hairy outside, glabrous inside. The five petals are joined to form an almost cylindrical tube long with five lobes on the end. The tube is off-white in colour with deep purple streaks on the upper lip. The lobes form two \\"lips\\" - the upper one with two lobes and the lower one longer with three lobes. The lower central lobe is the largest, long and about wide. The four stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the tube, one pair slightly shorter than the other. Flowering occurs in most months and is followed by an oval-shaped, hairy, sticky fruit. Taxonomy and naming Pityrodia byrnesii was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir from a specimen collected near the East Alligator River crossing in the Northern Territory. The description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The specific epithet (\\"byrnesii\\") honours Norman Byrnes, an Australian taxonomist.

This was the opening attack of the Brusilov Offensive under the overall command of Alexei Brusilov. The Russian 8th Army made a decisive breakthrough in the defenses of the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army in the area of the city of Lutsk in Ukraine. Battle On the night of June 4, General Alexei Kaledin opened an artillery barrage against Archduke Joseph Ferdinand's Austro-Hungarian defenses. Lasting through the night and into the morning, the Russian artillery broke gaps through the barbed wire trenches. This allowed the infantry to commence a surprise attack in the vicinity of Olyka. The complete surprise of the Russian attack caused many of the Austrians to be taken prisoner. Some entire units surrendered without resistance while others fled in panic. A counter-attack briefly secured the first line of trenches, but overwhelming numbers of Russian infantry pressed the attack and took the second and third line of defenses. Within days, 130,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers were lost. The influential German high- command requested the dismissal of Archduke Joseph, which was subsequently granted. The success of the Russian breakthrough caused Austria to halt its attacks in Italy and convinced Romania to enter the war.

Richard K. Harrison , 2008 although already the 17th century book The Man in the Moone describes the language of the Lunars, consisting \\"not so much of words and letters as tunes and strange sounds\\", which is in turn predated by other invented languages in fictional societies, e.g., in Thomas More's Utopia. Understanding alien languages As the science fiction genre developed, so did the use of the literary trope of alien languages. Some science-fiction works operate on the premise that alien languages can be easily learned if one has a competent understanding of the nature of languages in general. For example, the protagonist of C. S. Lewis's novel Out of the Silent Planet is able to use his training in historical linguistics to decipher the language spoken on Mars. Others work on the premise that languages with similarities can be partially understood by different species or could not understood at all. * Stanislaw Lem's novel His Master's Voice describes an effort by scientists to decode, translate and understand an extraterrestrial transmission. The novel critically approaches humanity's intelligence and intentions in deciphering and truly comprehending a message from outer space. * The 2014 novel Lamikorda by D. R. Merrill not only deals with differences in verbal communication, but gestures and other \\"body language\\", pointing out the inextricability of language with cultural and social norms. A number of long-running franchises have taken the concept of an alien language beyond that of a scripting device and have developed languages of their own. * Examples include the Klingon language of the Star Trek universe (a fully developed constructed language created by Marc Okrand) * The Zentradi language from the Macross Japanese science-fiction anime series * The DC Comics, Kryptonese (for which there exists an alphabet and language glossary) * For his 2009 science fiction film Avatar, creator and director James Cameron constructed the fictional Na'vi language (with the aid of college professor Paul Frommer) for his fictional alien Na'vi race in the film The existence of alien languages and the ease or difficulty of translation is used as a plot device or script element in a number of franchises, sometimes seriously, and sometimes for comedic value. * In Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, the crew is forced to speak (broken) Klingon without the universal translator. * In the film Mars Attacks!, the language spoken by the Martians appears to consist only of the words \\"ack!\\" and \\"rack!\\" spoken at different pitches and volume. The film's universal translator consistently translates these as being offers of friendship despite the fact that the aliens' actions are anything but friendly. * In one episode of Babylon 5, Commander Susan Ivanova gives orders to a Minbari crew in their language, and exclaims \\"Ah Hell!\\" in frustration, inadvertently giving the command \\"continuous fire\\" in Minbari. This is identical phonetically to \\"ahel\\" the Minbari translation of \\"continuous fire\\". * In Dragon Ball Z, Bulma speaks in her usual language (Japanese) and thereby involuntarily activates some functions of an alien starship, as her words are identified by the ship's computer as Namekkian orders. * C. J. Cherryh's Chanur series of books relies heavily on linguistic and psychological problems of communication between various alien races. Some examples include usage of obscure languages and cultural references to conceal information from others, imperfections of computer translation, use of pidgin and linguistic barriers, psychological concepts which do not have matches in other races' languages, and a race so alien that it cannot be understood at all without a translation by another race which itself can barely be understood due to manifold meanings in each message. In the Foreigner universe, Cherryh explores the interface between humans and Atevi, whose language relies on numerical values, causing the main character, Bren Cameron, to constantly calculate as he speaks the Atevi language, Ragi. * Conversely, in The Simpsons, the fact that English is mutually understood by the show's human and alien characters is noted as being \\"an astonishing coincidence\\". * Some stories, however, have alien beings speak near-unpronounceable tongues. Clark Ashton Smith, in one tale, has the sorcerer Eibon struggle to articulate the name of an alien, Hziulquoigmnzhah. * In Mary Doria Russell's philosophical/sci-fi novel The Sparrow, a linguist who travels to an alien planet as part of a Jesuit mission discovers a language with unique and (at first) incomprehensible tenses and conjugations. * In Carl Sagan's novel Contact (and the subsequent film adaptation), a broadcast from an extraterrestrial source is discovered to contain multiple layers of encrypted messages. * Ted Chiang's short story \\"Story of Your Life\\" describes attempts to communicate with a technologically advanced alien species that has no apparent understanding of basic mathematics and physics. * Sheila Finch published a collection of short stories about first contact and alien communication, The Guild of Xenolinguists, (Golden Gryphon Press), in 2007. * In 2008, the game Dead Space introduced a form of alien language known as Unitology, for the religion that mainly uses it. Unitology is only shown to be written with no example or indication of a verbal dialect. * In Futurama, a language exists called Alienese, which originates from an unspecified extraterrestrial source. At least one character has achieved an academic degree in xenolinguistics, which gives her the apparently rare skill of knowing how to translate between English and Alienese. * In the 2016 science- fiction movie, Arrival, a linguist is tasked by the U.S. Army to try and understand an alien language of complex symbols. The film received significant media attention for its unique and detailed portrayal of what human communication with aliens might resemble. Film production went as far as employing several linguistic professors from McGill University, including Jessica Coon, who serves as Canada Research Chair in Syntax and Indigenous Languages, and Wolfram Research Founder and CEO, Stephen Wolfram and his son, Christopher, to analyze the symbols which served as the language used in the film. * Various works from the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft present short sentences, excerpts and text fragments in the language of the Old Gods, referred to as \\"R'lyehian\\" or \\"Cthuvian\\" by the fan base. Lovecraft provided translations for some of the texts and denoted Cthuvian as a thick, guttural language, but he never published any details on pronunciation and grammar, so it is not possible to communicate in Cthuvian. Based on the limited text resources, only few grammatical rules and vocabulary could be worked out by fans, which are mostly guesswork. There is no evidence that Lovecraft even had a concept for the structure of the language when writing it. * Robert Sheckley's novelette \\"Shall We Have a Little Talk?\\" describes a language that mutates so drastically and so frequently that it completely defeats an attempt of an Earth emissary, a professional intuitive linguist, to arrange a \\"peaceful\\" takeover of the planet: to buy some property, then to bring troops to protect the property, etc. But the first step is to learn the alien language in order to write ironclad contracts, which turns out to be impossible: the language changes faster than the Earthling can learn it. Bypassing the issue of language =Universal translators= In some cases, authors avoid linguistic questions by introducing devices into their stories that seamlessly translate between languages, to the point that the concept of different languages can largely be excluded from the narrative. Notable examples include: * Douglas Adams's babel fish * The TARDIS from Doctor Who * The translator microbes in Farscape * The universal translator from Star Trek =Universal language= In some cases, the question of language is dealt with through the introduction of a universal language via which most, if not all, of the franchise's species are able to communicate. In the Star Wars universe, for example, this language is known as Basic and is spoken by the majority of the characters, with a few notable exceptions. Other alien species take advantage of their unique physiology for communication purposes, an example being the Ithorians, who use their twin mouths, located on either side of their neck, to speak in stereo. In some franchises this universal language is an intermediary language; one that different species can easily translate to and from their own languages, thus allowing simple communication between races. Examples of this approach include Interlac from the Legion of Super- Heroes, Babylon 5, and the Uplift Universe, where numerous sapient species use at least twelve \\"Galactic\\" languages (each version is used in communication between species that can articulate it, and that find it useful in expressing their concepts). Not all of these universal/intermediate languages take the form of spoken/written languages as is recognized in the human world. In the film and book Close Encounters of the Third Kind scientists use Solresol, a language based on musical tones, while in the film and book Contact, aliens send the instructions to build a machine to reach them using mathematics, which the main character calls \\"the only universal language\\". Similarly, in Stargate SG-1, the protagonists encounter a galactic meeting place where different races communicate with one another using a language based on atomic structures which is \\"written\\" in three dimensions rather than two. =Telepathy= Some science fiction stories imagine communication through telepathy. * There is for example the Vulcan mind meld in Star Trek. * In the novel Ender's Game, the \\"Buggers\\" are an alien species in which their queen can telepathically communicate with every member of her species, but no humans except Ender.

Cooper (February 21, 1934 – February 26, 2016) was an American painter, writer, illustrator, muralist, printmaker, and art teacher who spent most of his life in Buffalo, New York. His artwork combines an influence of his African heritage and his personal experience in America. Using symbolism, metaphors, color, and line, Cooper illustrates literal concepts in his works. Jazz music and famous African-American people are prominent themes in his art. He produced a young adult novel and a children's play later in his life, but is known for his numerous decorated murals exhibited within the United States and Ghana. Cooper was recognized in 2013 as a \\"Living Legacy Artist\\" by the Burchfield Penney Art Center. Biography =Early life= William Y. Cooper was born in Birmingham, Alabama on February 21, 1934. He moved to Buffalo, New York in 1954, where he remained for the rest of his life. Beginning at age four, Cooper showed a strong talent in arts. His grandmother urged him to stop pursuing the arts and focus on his math, science, and literature. Cooper continued to follow his artistic talent throughout his formal education. =Education= Before moving to Buffalo when he was 20, he studied art at Alabama State University for two years. His education was interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Army when World War II broke out. Despite being drafted, he was able to continue his artistic endeavors while serving for 18 months because he was the author and illustrator of the training brochures to be handed out to the U.S. Army Command stationed in Europe. Using the benefits from his G.I. Bill, Cooper traveled to Buffalo where he continued his professional education at the University at Buffalo. He received a degree in the Bachelor of Fine Arts and became a NYS Certified Art Teacher. Career =Professional career= Prior to 1995, Cooper owned an African art importing business called Bora Sanaa for fifteen years. He oftentimes traveled to West Africa during the summertime to gather antiques and artifacts from East and West Africa for his store. He was forced to close his business due to health complications in 1995. The Buffalo Arts Studio then provided Cooper with a studio from 1995 until his death in 2016. There he produced many works and mentored hundreds of aspiring artists during his lifetime. The former art director of the studio stated \\"he always had a long line of steady visitors to his studio.\\" He also taught at the Buffalo public schools for twelve years and was an art teacher in the Education Department of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. =Art locations= African and American history and culture were the main influences of Cooper's art. His works have been widely presented within the art community of the United States and around the world since 1969. Locations such as Niagara Falls, Buffalo, Birmingham, Atlanta, Albany, Washington D.C., Ontario, and Ghana are examples of places where his art was and is exhibited. He exhibited his art in five solo shows since 1971 in Niagara Falls, Buffalo, and Ghana, West Africa. Cooper was one of only ten artists who were chosen to be a part of the project called \\"Art Across Borders\\" for the Pan American Exhibition. Five large murals were produced for the Women's Pavilion to celebrate historical African-American women such as Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and Ida B. Wells. Several of his pieces are in the Castellani Art Museum in Niagara Falls, New York as part of its permanent collection. =Recognition= Throughout his career, Cooper earned several awards for his artistic endeavors. The Arts Council in Buffalo & Erie County honored Cooper for two consecutive years. He earned a New York State Council on the Arts DEC Grant in 1996, and then the Annual Professional Artist Award in 1997. That same year, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority gave him a Community Artist Recognition Award. The Burchfield Penney Art Center selected Cooper to be a \\"Living Legacy\\" artist in 2013. He was chosen two times to be a part of the Annual Atlanta Life African American National Art Competition/Exhibition in Atlanta, Georgia. Cooper was a member of the National Conference of Artists and of the Alliance of African American Artists in America. He is also credited with founding and running the Afrocentric Artists' Collective for three years until 1981. Artwork =Self-definition= Cooper's art is known for its African and American influences. He defines himself as \\"an Afrocentric artist. My world view is rooted in an African frame of reference and a deep, abiding sense of the creator from whence I draw my inspiration, strength and a sense of who I am. Thematically and stylistically, my works are a fusion of two cultures: my American experience and my African heritage…My work is conceptual, subjective and highly metaphorical. The use of symbols allows me to explore literal ideas. I believe that art is the creative expression of our experiences, and probably the noblest expression of the human spirit. If so, then art must embody the highest ideals and aspirations of humankind.\\" He states that \\"my work is not as much about the subject as it is about how I render the subject. I use symbols to express ideas and concepts. Color, which is never haphazardly selected, shapes the mood of the composition and creates rhythm and harmony.\\" =Composition= Cooper's art is alive with movement, illumination, and color. They are pieced together with many elements and symbols. Cooper was not focused on what the subject is, but rather on how he crafted it. African-American contributions to American culture, like jazz music, and West African influences form his works. He used line, color, and form to generate harmony and rhythm like that of music. The composition forces the viewer to think about what he believes Cooper created, however, each person interprets his works differently according to their own experiences and lives. He believes \\"meanings change as each person views the work through the lens of their own experience.\\" Pursuing imagination, creativity, expression, and ingenuity are Cooper's intentions for his art. =Murals= Although he worked in several mediums like watercolor and acrylics, and on multiple surfaces like murals and canvases, Cooper preferred to work with oils because he believed it gave him a wider freedom to make the paint do what he wanted. He is known for assisting students with 40 murals as a part of the Buffalo Art Studio's mural project. There are three of his murals in the Buffalo area that were commissioned by the city: a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Branch of the Public Library in Buffalo titled \\"I Have a Dream\\" completed in 1982; a Centennial Mural done in 1991 for the Buffalo Federation of Neighborhood Centers; a mural on the walls of the Colored Musicians Club Museum in the Michigan Street African American Heritage Corridor; and a mural placed in the Tri- Main/ArtSpace. One of his last murals was painted on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. Cooper was also commissioned to create portraits of influential Western New York African-Americans such as James Bell and Geneva B. Scruggs. Additional work Cooper believed \\"all the arts call for the imagination\\" and \\"the tools might be different but the expression is the same.\\" He published two books in his career. Cooper's coming-of-age novel titled, 77 Jackson Street, Rear was published in 2010. It takes place in 1955 Alabama when a young boy named Denmark and his friend are kidnapped during the famous bus boycott in Montgomery while on a mission to find his father. Denmark uses the lessons he learned about the Jim Crow era from his grandmother to try to find a way to escape. His children's book that later became a children's play, called Nakai and the Red Shoes was produced in 2007. A nine-year-old girl named Nakai living in Africa found an American Sears catalog with a pair of red shoes she craved to have, but could not afford. She continues on adventures to try to raise money to buy them herself. Both 77 Jackson Street, Rear, and Nakai and the Red Shoes were illustrated by one of Cooper's sons, Joel Cooper. Family Cooper married and had five children. His wife, Glendora Johnson-Cooper, is a native of Buffalo and a tenured librarian at the University at Buffalo. She is the youngest of eight siblings. The couple remained in Buffalo and raised their family among the community. Cooper and his wife had four sons named Michael Stubbs, Yancy Cooper, Joel Cooper, Juan King, and one daughter named Sharelle Bennigan. He has four grandchildren; Erik, J.C. (deceased) Jaxon, and Christina; and one great- grandchild named Taylor. Cooper died in his home in Buffalo on February 26, 2016 at the age of 82.

Belle Mitchell Jackson (December 31, 1848 – October 6, 1942) was an American educator, activist, small business owner, and abolitionist from Danville, Kentucky. Mitchell was one of the founders of the Colored Orphans Industrial Home in Lexington, Kentucky. Early life and education Eliza Isabelle (Belle) Mitchell was born on December 31, 1848 in Perryville, Kentucky to Monroe and Mary Mitchell. Her father was a carpenter. Her parents were former slaves who bought their own freedom before her birth. Prior to her early teaching positions, she attended private school in Danville, KY and Xenia, Ohio. Later, she completed her education at Berea College. Mitchell met Rev. John Gregg Fee, an American Missionary Association (AMA) minister and abolitionist, in fall 1865 at her church in Danville. Fee hired Mitchell for her first teaching position as the first African American teacher at Camp Nelson. Educator Though her employer, the American Missionary Association strongly advocated abolitionism, members’ view toward full equality differed substantially. Rev. Fee was a strong voice for full equality, a view not shared by the other teachers who were white. Thus, her hiring led to controversy. Camp Nelson was first established in 1863 as a Union depot during the United States Civil War. By mid-1864, the site had become a major United States Colored Troops (USCT) facility, training 10,000 of Kentucky’s 23,000 USCT. With the troops came others fleeing slavery, mostly their families, who were referred to as refugees, totaling over 3,000. The emancipation of enslaved males in Kentucky upon enlistment was authorized in June 1864, six months after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation which was limited to the 11 rebellious states in the Confederate States of America. Kentucky was among the four slaveholding Union states. By December 1864, the military authorized the construction of the Home for Colored Refugees which paved the way for the school, teachers’ quarters, a mess hall, and a dormitory Included were 16 by 16 foot duplex cottages for families, a mess hall, barracks, a school, teachers’ quarters and a dormitory. March 1865, a Congressional Act was passed that freed the wives and children of the U.S. Colored Troops. When Mitchell began teaching at Camp Nelson, enrolled at the school were 600 refugees, women and children who recently had obtained their freedom through the 1865 act. However, Mitchell's time at Camp Nelson was cut short. Military officers and ten of the 12 teachers refused to dine with her in the mess hall. Rev. Fee rejected the teachers’ protest. However, during his brief absence, the camp superintendent forced her to leave. After leaving Camp Nelson, Mitchell was immediately invited to teach at The Missionary Free School of Color. The school was opened by the black First Baptist Church of Lexington, KY. The AMA paid the teacher, but the school struggled with both a serious lack of supplies school and a shortage of warm clothing which hampered winter attendance. By March 1870, Mitchell had an enrollment of 95, mostly between the ages of six and 16. Despite the scarcities, Mitchell stated she has “reasonable hope” that her students had made progress out of their “untutored state.” She also taught in Frankfort, Louisville, Nicholasville, and Richmond, Kentucky. Activism Mitchell was a founder of the Colored Orphans Industrial Home in Lexington, Kentucky. One of the 15 local black women listed as the board of directors in the incorporation filed in Sept 1892, she was elected board president. Originally the institution was a home for elderly African American women without family to care for them. Eventually, the home became an orphanage and school for homeless African American children. The large brick home on two acres was on Georgetown Street. Business In 1871, Mitchell married Jordan Jackson, a successful businessman in Lexington, Kentucky. Jackson was an undertaker and livery owner. After her marriage, she owned a millinery shop in Lexington, located at 9 South Mill Street. The couple adopted two children. Jackson and Mitchell worked together on political efforts to advance the lives of the African- American community in Kentucky.

Raheja has been writing on cinema for over 30 years. In his long and prolific career as a writer, he has worked as the Editor of Movie magazine (1988-1999), Channel Editor of India Today’s online film section and Editor of Bollywood News Service. He has been a regular columnist for rediff.com and Sunday Mid-day for over a decade and his articles have been published in The Times of India, The Indian Express, The Hindustan Times, India Today and Outlook. Raheja is a committed film historian and has authored five books: The Hundred Luminaries of Hindi Cinema (1996), Indian Cinema, The Bollywood Saga (2004), Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam: The Original Screenplay (2012), Chaudhvin Ka Chand: The Original Screenplay (2014) and Kaagaz Ke Phool – The Original Screenplay (2015). Raheja also writes for TV (Just Mohabbat (fiction), Kasamh Se (fiction), and the BBC World TV show, Film India) and pens poems in English and Hindi, which have been published in several magazines and newspapers. In 2017 Raheja initiated THE DINESH RAHEJA WORKSHOP in which he teaches Bollywood aspirants everything related to the media including the art of image building and giving interviews. In August 2017, he has also released his first book of poems, '101 Haiku by Dinesh Raheja'. Education and early career Raheja was born to a Sindhi business family in Mumbai. His father Bhagwandas Raheja was a finance broker and his mother Janki a housewife. Raheja graduated from Palm Beach High School, Napean Sea Road, in December 1973 and from HR College of Commerce in 1978. Raised on a staple diet of two films a week, he showed a proclivity for the arts from an early age and, while still a reader, began writing about films for magazines such as Filmfare, Star and Style and Cine Blitz. He often won small sums of Rs 100 in contests for the Best Letter of the Month. Interviews with Hema Malini and Zeenat Aman were published, based on his questions as a reader. After a half-hearted attempt at pursuing chartered accountancy, Raheja embraced the true calling of his life in 1982 and embarked on a career in film journalism. He began writing on films first for the monthly magazine, Cine Blitz, though this was preceded by a short stint as a reporter with The Daily newspaper. Milestones as an editor Rising quickly through the ranks, he was the Chief Reporter of Cine Blitz by the time he left in September 1988. Thereafter, he became the Editor of Movie magazine at the young age of 31. He has conducted analytical, in-depth interviews with most of the leading lights of the Hindi film industry including Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Rishi Kapoor, Mithun Chakraborty, Anil Kapoor, Jackie Shroff, Sunny Deol, Rekha, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Dimple Kapadia, Ram Gopal Varma, Mahesh Bhatt, Mukul Anand and Subhash Ghai. Over the next decade, Raheja had a golden run at the magazine, and embarked on several innovative ventures. Recognising the demand for high-quality visuals of the stars, Raheja simultaneously edited several issues of Postermag and Classic Postcards. These were released by the stars who featured in them (Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan etc.). The innovative features in Movie magazine included the 'Dial A Star Scheme' (you could talk to your favourite film star on a pre-advertised date; Juhi Chawla was the first to speak to her fans and was followed by Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit among several others) and 'Movie Goes Mad' (a cartoon series that became hugely popular). Raheja's witty spoofs on films, which were then illustrated, included a takeoff on the superhit Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Raheja's most famous covers for Movie magazine include his first cover that featured then rising star Aamir Khan alongside contemporaneous box-office queen Sridevi; a body-painted picture of Pooja Bhatt, and the momentous cover when two megastars Amitabh Bachchan and Rajesh Khanna came together for a photo-session and a joint interview that ran into reams of print. His annual feature for the magazine, 'The Movie Opinion Poll,' which let the public vote for ‘The Best Actor’ and ‘The Best Actress’ among 40 categories, inspired many clones. Raheja also conducted an auction of star paraphernalia, 'Forever Yours,' which included Shammi Kapoor's chess set, Raj Kapoor's tweed coat, Juhi Chawla's pillow and Madhuri's dhak dhak outfit from Beta, the proceeds of which were handed over to Cheshire Homes, an old-age home. Books on cinema In 1996, after a cover story on The Hundred Luminaries Of Hindi Cinema, he was asked by Padmini Mirchandani of IBH, the publisher of Movie magazine, to give it the shape of a book. Amitabh Bachchan launched the book in Mumbai, and subsequently Rekha, Anil Kapoor and Sridevi launched it in other places. Raheja has collaborated with Jitendra Kothari on four other books on cinema: Indian Cinema, The Bollywood Saga (Roli Books), Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam: The Original Screenplay, Chaudhvin Ka Chand: The Original Screenplay (2014) and Kaagaz Ke Phool – The Original Screenplay (Om Books). Creative pursuits Ayaz Memon, the editor of Mid-day in the mid '90s, enthused Raheja to write a personalised column for the Sunday paper; and later, an analytical box-office think piece on a weekday. Raheja remained a columnist with Mid-day for an unbroken stint of 13 years (1996 to 2009). For television, Raheja has written the concept for Tony And Deeya Singh's Just Mohabbat and was one of the prominent writers on Ekta Kapoor's Kasamh Se (2006). UTV asked him to write two seasons of the BBC show, Film India (hosted by Victor Banerjee). He is married to Anita whom he met in December 1982. Anita Raheja is a popular food columnist and author of two bestselling books, Simply Sumptuous Sindhi Cooking and High Tea And Kitty Party Recipes. They have a daughter, Nikita Raheja, better known as Nikita Mohanty in the film industry for her work as a costume stylist for films such as English Vinglish, Two States, Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania and Kapoor & Sons. Raheja has initiated a debate group 'Let's Talk Over Chai,' in which professionals from all strands of life—writing, modelling, playback singing, photography, film direction – participate. In consonance with his belief in the need to connect, Raheja, in his spare time, teaches English to the less privileged.

Botswana opened its embassy in New Delhi in 2006. Botswana President Festus Mogae has visited India twice in May 2005 and December 2006. During the second visit, India agreed to provide a line of credit of US$20 million and a grant-in-aid of 50 million to develop Botswana's health and education sectors respectively. The two nations have signed several agreements related to bilateral trade, taxation, cultural exchanges, and science and technology. Botswana is also a part of India's Pan African E-Network Project. In September 2014, the two sides concluded an agreement under which the Indian Army will provide training to the Botswana Defence Forces. Citizens of Botswana are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. Economic relations Bilateral trade between Botswana and India totaled US$1.1 billion in 2014-15. The primary commodity imported by India from Botswana is diamonds. The major commodities exported by India to Botswana are items manufactured goods, metals, machinery and equipment, cotton yarn, fabrics, ready-made garments, pharmaceuticals, and transport equipment. Botswana's large reserves of diamonds are of great interest to the Indian diamond industry, particularly in Surat. Surat is a major centre for cutting and polishing of rough diamonds. Indian firms Shrenuj, Blue Star and KGK Diamonds have offices and factories in Botswana. In 2008, the Indian Diamond Institute signed an agreement with the Government of Botswana to establish an India-Africa Diamond Institute in the country. The institute will be staffed with Indian faculty who will teach courses on diamond cutting, polishing and grading along with jewellery manufacturing. Jindal Steel & Power Limited (JSPL) acquired Canadian-firm CIC Energy which is involved in coal mining and power production in Botswana. JSPL intends to establish two 300 MW coal power plants in the Mamambula coal blocks areas where huge coal deposits have been found. Botswana opened a trade office called the Botswana Export Development and Investment Authority (BEDIA) in Mumbai in 2010. The office was subsequently renamed the Botswana Investment and Trade Centre (BITC). Following a meeting between BITC and CII in July 2010, Botswana's Assistant Minister of Trade and Industry Maxwell Motowane declared \\"Botswana has found the Indian business environment compatible and seeks to benefit from expertise in areas such as information technology, health care, transport and education.\\" The Bank of Baroda began operating in Botswana in 2001.

He is reported to have conducted extensive studies on the tectonics of the Himalayas and is an elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India, The World Academy of Sciences, Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences in 1979.  Biography  Banaras Hindu University V. K. Gaur, born on 11 July 1936 in Varanasi, a temple town in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, completed his master's degree at Banaras Hindu University with gold medal in 1955 and proceeded to the UK for his doctoral studies at Imperial College, London. After securing a PhD from the University of London in 1959, he did his post-doctoral work at Paris-Sorbonne University and started his career by joining National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) as a scientific officer in 1960. A year later, he returned to India and joined University of Roorkee (present-day Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee) as a reader where he spent 21 years, serving as a professor and the dean of research from 1978 till he moved to National Geophysical Research Institute as the director in 1983. After a service of 6 years, the Government of India appointed him as the secretary to the Department of Ocean Development of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, a post he held till 1992 when he joined CSIR Forth Paradigm (then known as CSIR Centre for Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulation-CMMACS) as a Distinguished Professor. He served CMMACS till his superannuation in 1996, but continues to be associated with the institute as a CSIR Honorary Scientist. He also holds the position of a Distinguished Professor at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. In between, he held the directorship of Deccan Gold Mines from 2006 to 2011.  Legacy  Indian Astronomical Observatory One of the first contributions of Gaur to the science of geology came during his doctoral studies at Imperial College when he discovered the host rock effect in geo- electromagnetics, which had been unsuspected till then and this discovery assisted him in earning his PhD. His later studies covered the fields of geodesy, seismology and electromagnetics and his studies on the tectonics of Himalayas assisted in estimating the plate under-thrusts and understanding the micro-earthquakes in the region. He is credited with the discovery of the thick Deccan lithosphere which he accomplished using the seismic tomography experiments for the first time in India. He is reported to be the first scientist to use Global Positioning System Geodesy to measure the Indian plate velocity quantitatively in comparison to the Eurasian plate velocity and as well as the first to conduct an experiment to constrain global carbon fluxes in India and Central Asia through inversion of ultra-high precision atmospheric concentration data. His studies have been documented as several peer-reviewed articles, the article repository of the Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 61 of them. On the infrastructure development front, his contributions are reported in the implementation of Marine Satellite and Ocean Information Services and in the establishment of a CO2 laboratory at Indian Astronomical Observatory, Hanle. It was during his tenure as the professor, academic programs on signal analysis, inverse theory and computational geophysics were introduced at the University of Roorkee and the University Grants Commission of India subsequently extended the courses designed by him to other universities. His involvement is also known in the preparation of science texts for higher secondary studies of the Central Board of Secondary Education. He was one of the propagators of the Science to People programs and also sat in the councils of the Indian National Science Academy (1985–87 and 1994–96) and the Indian Academy of (Sciences 1992-97).  Awards and honors  Gaur, a recipient of doctorates (honoris causa) from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad, Andhra University and Banaras Hindu University, received the Khosla Research Award of the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee in 1971. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1979.

It was taken from her album, Feel This Free (2005). At the 35th annual Country Music Awards of Australia in January 2007, the song won three Golden Guitars for 'Song of the Year','Female Artist of the Year' and 'Single of the Year'. Cole performed \\"Poster Girl\\" at the MCG on ANZAC day in 2007 in front of a crowd of 100,000. Background and release Between December 2005 and January 2006, Cole travelled to Iraq and The Middle East to do a series of concerts for Australian Defence Force. Upon her return, she received a letter from a fan objecting to her Tour de Force appearances, mistakenly thinking her singing overseas to Aussie troops amounted to her supporting the war. Cole said the criticism stung, \\"To be accused of supporting some sort of ridiculous war on terror – which was not what I was doing at all – hurt.\\" Cole explained; \\"I was incredibly inspired by the whole experience of going over to the Middle East to entertain the Aussie troops, but also getting to know them and understanding what they're all about. I was like a proud mother hen over there, so I really did want to come back and sing their praises. I wanted to write a song, but I didn't know what angle. That's when I received the criticism.\\" Cole continued saying \\"You can support the troops without supporting the war. You can recognise that they do an amazing job, that they put their lives on the line and put themselves in danger because we need a Defence Force. Wonderful, wonderful people.\\" In October 2006, the song went viral after there was a short passage about the song in Defence Direct and was picked up by Melbourne blogger, Andrew Llanderyou, which was the source of Andrew Bolt's Herald Sun article which in turn was the source for American blogs like Blackfive and even the Toronto Sun.

They are also known as Baiame's Ngunnhu, Nonah, or Nyemba Fish Traps. The Brewarrina Aboriginal Cultural Museum, opened in 1988, adjoins the site. The fish traps were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 August 2000 and to the Australian National Heritage List on 3 June 2005.  History  =Aboriginal land= The traditional custodians of the fish traps are the Ngemba Wayilwan (or Wailwan) people. Nearby Aboriginal groups include the Baranbinja, Morowari, Kula, Naualko, Ualarai, Weilwan, Kamilaroi, Kamu and Paarkinlji people. It has been estimated that the region supported a population of about 3,000 people prior to European settlement. The river people generally settled along the main rivers in summer and moved to regular campsites located in drier country during the winter months. While the rivers acted as important travel and trade routes, each tribe had a clearly defined territory, the boundaries of which were commonly marked by prominent physical features. Evidence of the occupation and use of these places survives across the landscape in the form of open campsites, middens, scarred trees, stone quarries, stone arrangements, burial grounds, ceremonial sites and rock art. Archaeological remains are especially concentrated along riverine corridors, reflecting the intensive occupation of these areas. In 1829 Charles Sturt came across what he considered to be a permanent camp of 70 huts each capable of housing 12-15 people beside the Darling River near present-day Bourke. Similarly, Thomas Mitchell reported the existence of permanent huts on both banks of the Darling River above present-day Wilcannia in 1835. Before the British came, thousands of people visited these fish traps for large corroborees in which each group's use of the fish traps was controlled by strict protocols. Brewarrina retains a rich collection of Aboriginal sites consisting of axe grinding grooves, burial grounds, open campsites, knapping sites, scarred trees, ceremonial sites, middens and stone quarries. Prior to European disturbance, both banks of the river at the fish traps were lined by almost continuous middens with an accumulation of shells and other objects more than a metre deep. In 1901, the anthropologist Robert Hamilton Mathews noted more than two dozen axe grinding places along the river banks at the fish traps. The Barwon Four Reserve on the northern bank of the Barwon River contains 250 recorded sites including two known burial grounds. =Creation story= The creation of the Ngunnhu is enshrined in ancient tradition. Many Aboriginal people believe that the fish traps were designed and created by Baiame, a great ancestral being who is respected by numerous cultural groups in western NSW, including the Ngemba Wayilwan, Morowari. Walkwan, Wongaibon, Ualarai, Kamilaroi and Wlradjuri. The creation story is well known to Aboriginal people of the region, having been passed down by word of mouth from generation to generation. Elements of the story have also been recorded by various European visitors to the fish traps, from Robert Hamilton Mathews in 1903 through to his granddaughter-in-law Janet Mathews in 1985. According to legend, Baiame camped at a granite outcrop called Bai near present-day Byrock. A rock-hole located here was dug by him and the small depression nearby is where Baiame and his wives did their cooking. On the rock at Bai are impressions of a number of Baiame's weapons and utensils including his fighting club or \\"bunid\\" spear and dilly bag. He moved from here to Cobar where he camped in a large cave. The visible copper at Cobar is said to have been formed by the excrement of Baiame. From Cobar he traveled north. Baiame reached the site where the Ngunnhu now stands during a time of drought. The Ngemba Wayilwan people were facing famine as Gurrungga (the deep waterhole at Brewarrina upstream of the rock bar) had completely dried up. Upon seeing their plight, Baiame conceived of a gift for the Ngemba Wayilwan - an intricate series of fish traps in the dry river bed. He designed the traps by casting his great net across the course of the river. Using the pattern of their father's net, Baiame's two sons Booma-ooma-nowi and Ghinda-inda-mui built the traps from stones. Baiame then showed the Ngemba Wayilwan men how to call the rain through dance and song. Days of rain followed, filling the river channel and flooding Baiame's net which filled with thousands of fish. The old men rushed to block the entry of the stone traps, herding fish through the pens. Baiame instructed the Ngemba Wayilwan people in how to use and maintain the Ngunnhu. Although they were to be the custodians of the fishery, Baiame declared that the maintenance and use of the traps should be shared with other cultural groups in the area. People from all of the groups that came to use and rely upon the fish traps had deep feelings of gratitude to Baiame. Two large footprints made by Baiame remained at the Ngunnhu. One was located opposite the rock called Muja, the other was some 350m downstream of the traps on the southern bank of the river. One of these imprints is still visible. It is a strong belief that wherever Baiame camped, some of his spirit remains at the site. This applies to the Ngunnhu. After creating the Ngunnhu, Baiame's family group travelled further to the east. Their path is now the winding course of the Barwon River. The tracks of his spirit dogs who moved separately across the landscape formed the tributary streams of the Warrego, Culgoa, Bokhara and Bogan Rivers. Before rejoining Baiame at a camp between Cumborah and Walgett, the dogs camped together on an arid plain, transforming it into Narran Lake. The Ualarai people call Narran Lake \\"Galiburima\\" which means Wild Dog Water. The story of Baiame as creator of the fish traps was reported by Kathleen Langloh Parker in her 1905 book, The Euahlayi Tribe: 'Byamee is the originator of things less archaic and important than totemism. There is a large stone fish-trap at Brewarrina, on the Barwan River. It is said to have been made by Byamee and his gigantic sons, just as later Greece attributed the walls of Tiryns to the Cyclops, or as Glasgow Cathedral has been explained in legend as the work of the Picts. Byamee also established the rule that there should be a common camping-ground for the various tribes, where, during the fishing festival, peace should be strictly kept, all meeting to enjoy the fish, and do their share towards preserving the fisheries.' The travels of Baiame are only one of the many creation stories set within the landscape of the Brewarrina district. Others include the stories of the kurrea serpent living in Boobera Lagoon on the Barwon River, the great warrior Toolalla, an eminent man called Yooneeara, and Mullian, the eagle, at nearby Cuddie Springs. The linkages between landscape features through long-distance creation stories means that many of them, including the fish traps, are important to Aboriginal people from distant places, as well as local communities. =Age of the fish traps= It has been suggested that these fish traps may be the oldest human construction in the world. The age of the fish traps is currently unknown. Given the location in the bed of a river, the fish traps would have been a dynamic structure, constantly changing. The river flow itself would have modified the fish traps which would also have been continually added to or altered by Aboriginal people over the course of hundreds or thousands of years. This constant reworking of the construction means that it is difficult to assign an original date to it. An indication of when the Brewarrina fish traps were constructed may possibly be gauged by considering changes in the flow of the Barwon River. Construction of the fish traps would only have worked if low water levels were relatively frequent and regular in the river. Evidence from the lower Darling River indicates that during the past 50,000 years prolonged periods of low flow occurred between 15,000 and 9,000 years ago, and then from about 3,000 years ago up until the present time. Whether or not these dates also apply to low flow periods in the Barwon River is currently unknown.Hope and Vines 1994 quoted in Rando, 2007, p21 =Early European descriptions= The earliest known reference to the fish traps by a European was made in 1848 by the then Commissioner of Crown Lands at Wellington, W. C. Mayne. His observations, albeit brief, were made within the first decade of European settlement of the district: :In a broad but shallow part of the head of the River where there are numerous rocks, the Aborigines have formed several enclosures or Pens, if I may use the word, into which the fish are carried, or as it were decoyed by the current, are there retained. To form these must have been a work of no trifling labour, and no slight degree of ingenuity and skill must have been exercised in their construction, as I was informed by men who have passed several years in the vicinity, that not even the heaviest floods displace the stones forming these enclosures. A second, equally brief description was published in 1861 by William Richard Randell, the captain of the river boat Gemini, who had navigated the upper reaches of the Darling River as far as the \\"Nonah\\" in 1859. His report in the Journal of the Royal Geographic Society states: :The obstacle presented to the navigation at Nonah is a fall at low water and a very swift rapid at the time of the Gemini's visit; the descent being about 8 feet in 200 or 300 yards, and the water boiling and foaming over rocks for that distance. It is called the Black's fishing-grounds in consequence of their having (assisted by natural facilities) built a great number of circular walls of stone in the bed of the river extending from below the falls to a distance of half a mile above. The first known detailed studies of the fish traps were made in the early years of the 20th century. The surveyor Robert Hamilton Mathews, one of the pioneers of Australian anthropology, visited the fish traps in 1901. He prepared the first detailed documentation of the fish traps, relying heavily upon the knowledge of Aboriginal people he had met. In 1903, Mathews described the construction and layout of the fish traps in a paper published in the journal of the Royal Society of New South Wales. Five years after Mathews' visit, A. W. Mullen, a surveyor with the Western Lands Board of New South Wales, also surveyed the fish traps. Two versions of his plan survive. The most detailed of these is drawn in his field notebook. The second plan, dated 15 June 1906, is based upon the first but has been simplified. When Mathews and Mullen surveyed the fish traps there were already far fewer traps than in pre-European times because of disuse or disturbance from the activities of early settlers. The key features of the construction of the fish traps as described by Mathews and Mullen are summarized in Hope and Vines (1994). About the same time as the first surveys of the fish traps were being conducted in the early 20th century, numerous photographs were taken of the fisheries. These are held in the Tyrell Collection in the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney. =Disruption and decline= The appearance of Europeans on the banks of the Barwon River heralded the beginning of a prolonged period of dramatic, and often violent, disruption of Aboriginal society. It also marked the start of the deliberate and sometimes inadvertent degradation of Baiame's Ngunnhu. Introduced diseases ravaged Aboriginal populations in advance of the first European explorers and settlers. During the 1820s and 1830s, smallpox epidemics spread along the important travel routes of the Murray and Darling River systems causing many deaths.Dargin 1976 quoted in Rando, 2007, p37 The first European explorer to visit the region, Captain Charles Sturt, reached the Darling River in 1829 by which time much disease prevailed throughout the tribes.Sturt 1833 quoted in Rando, 2007, p37 By 1836, white settlement had reached the junction of the Barwon and Castlereagh Rivers. Within three years, settlers had occupied land at Baiame's Ngunnhu. The first legal title to land at Brewarrina was granted to the Lawson brothers in 1839. Their run, named \\"Moheni\\", extended along the southern bank of the Barwon River adjacent to the fish traps. The opposite bank was included in Quantambone station which had been established by Major George Druitt. Within a decade, river frontage properties were occupied along the length of the Barwon River.Dargin 1976 quoted in Rando, 2007, p38 With the concentration of settlers and their stock along the rivers of the region, Aboriginal people were dispossessed of many of their important waterholes, hunting grounds, camping areas and ceremonial sites, disrupting the traditional life of the Ngemba Wayilwan, Kamilaroi and Ualarai people. The twenty years that followed the initial pastoral invasion of Aboriginal lands were characterized by violent clashes. According to Dargin it was a time of \\"many killings, retaliatory raids, punitive expeditions, revenge or fear killings, or more euphemistically, grazing or property management or sport. For the first decade of white settlement, guerrilla warfare prevailed\\". In addition to the loss of their tribal lands, a key grievance was the abduction and abuse of Aboriginal women. Frontier life was considered to be too harsh for white women, leading to an imbalance between the numbers of men and women in the settler population. As a result, the abduction of Aboriginal women by white settlers became a common practice. In one recorded incident in 1859 a stockman at Walcha Hut on the Lawson run was warned by Aborigines to release one of their women. He refused, and both he and the woman were killed. In retaliation, the settlers shot a large number of Aboriginal men, women and children in what became known as the Hospital Creek Massacre. The rock bar across the Barwon River at the fish traps quickly became a common watering and camping place for teamsters and drovers moving mobs of cattle. This appropriation of the fish traps angered the Ngemba Wayilwan people, as evidenced by the recollections of William Kerrigan: \\"My father and his two brothers, Bob and Andrew, came to Brewarrina when the blacks were bad, my father had someone with him when he used to cart water from the rocky crossing, each one used to take turn about with the rifle in case a wild black showed his head in the scrub on the bank\\". Prompted by the loss of access to the fish traps for Aboriginal people, the then Commissioner of Crown Lands at Wellington, W. C. Mayne, attempted to have the area around the fishery reserved for Aboriginal people in 1848. Nothing came of Mayne's recommendation. Large gatherings of Aboriginal people came to be viewed with suspicion. A policy of detribalisation was introduced, in which family groups were separated from each other at different pastoral stations. The effects of this policy and the ongoing violence on the use of the fish traps by Aboriginal people were catastrophic. The last time the fish traps were fully utilised and regularly maintained was probably during the 1850s or 1860s. =Township of Brewarrina= European occupation of the Brewarrina district not only made the traditional use and maintenance of the fish traps difficult but resulted in much active destruction of them. The rock bar at the fish traps provided a ready-made river crossing for settlers establishing stations to the north. The abundant stones of the fish traps were used to fill in holes in the crossing to make a ford suitable for bullock drays. But it was the arrival of Captain William Randall in his riverboat the \\"Gemini\\" in 1859 that dramatically hastened the demise of the traps. As the head of navigation on the Darling River, the site had great potential to be developed as a port to service the riverboat trade. The township of Brewarrina was surveyed in 1861 and formally proclaimed on 28 April 1863. As the town developed, rocks were removed from the fish traps for use in building foundations and to upgrade the ford across the river into a causeway. Randell, in an 1861 report on his pioneering trip, had noted that: :I believe that a passage may be very easily made through these rocks [the fish traps], so that steamers could ascend the rapids with the assistance of warps in seasons of moderate flow.Rando, 2007, p40 His suggestion was acted upon and rocks that formed parts of the fish traps were removed to create a passage for steamers and barges. Additional rocks were removed or displaced to free riverboats that periodically became trapped in the fish traps at low water levels. In 1872 a pontoon bridge was constructed across the river just downstream of the fish traps for the crossing of sheep, wool and other goods. Two years later a public punt was established nearby for the ferrying of light vehicles. At this time, some 300 Aboriginal people lived at Brewarrina. But with the arrival of Sergeant Steele in 1878, Aboriginal people were forced to camp away from the town on the northern bank of the Barwon River adjacent to the fish traps. They were instructed to only visit town during daylight hours and at 6pm each evening Steele enforced a curfew with a horsewhip.Dargin 1976 quoted in Rando, 2007, p40 The \\"problem\\" of Aboriginal people camping around Brewarrina was deemed by the first Protector of Aborigines to be one of most pressing issues in NSW.Heritage Division, 2006 In 1885 the Aborigines Protection Board moved the Aboriginal people to a reserve on the northern bank of the river two miles from town. In the following year they were moved again, still further from town, to the Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission, a mission established by the Aborigines Protection Association. This new mission was located ten miles out of town on a 5,000 acre reserve. On the mission, people were prevented from eating their traditional foods. Instead they were served rations of sugar, tea, coffee and refined flour. They were also forbidden to speak their own language or participate in any of their cultural practices or customs. Despite this segregation and the forced abandonment of their cultural traditions, a report in the Sydney Mail in 1888 claimed that: \\"The blacks still adhere to their old habit of frequenting the Fisheries at proper seasons, when they rejoice in high living, coupled with corroborees\\". But by then, the great corroborees of earlier times were no more, with gatherings attracting hundreds rather than thousands of people. By 1897 the Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission was home to about 43 Aboriginal people. According to A.W. Mullen writing in 1906: \\"there is a woman at present at the Mission station called Murray or Nelly Taylor whose husband (now dead) for years back helped to keep these Fishery in repair and told the younger members of the tribe that the aborigines built the Fishery - this woman is now about 70 years of age and her husband was much older than she was\\". During the early years of the 20th century, the fish traps continued to receive some use and parts of the system were kept in repair by the small community of Ngemba Wayilwan and Morowari people living at the mission. Doreen Wright of the Ngemba Wayilwan people recalled: 'Old King Clyde, he was the boss of the stone fish traps here in the river at Brewarrina. When the old people wanted to get fish down at the traps the old King would tell them all to stand out on the banks. The old King would dive down into the fish going into the stone fish traps. The old people wouldn't have to spear the fish, they would just walk into the river and catch them under the gills and fill their bugguda, their dilly bags, up with them'.Wright, 1965 quoted in Rando, 2007, p41-42 Some of the traps were still being maintained by people from the mission in 1912. They replaced smaller fallen rocks and frequently diverted the water flow to cut away deposits of silt. In 1915 just one man, Steve Shaw, was working the traps. He would block the entrance to a trap with an iron wheel covered with wire and wade through the trap disturbing any fish with a length of wire and driving them into the shallow end where he caught them in a small wire net. Between World War I and World War II, the fish traps, then known as \\"The Rocks\\" became a place for Aboriginal people to drink alcohol. With police patrols searching for drunks, many Aboriginal people stopped visiting the area during this period.Rando, 2007, p42 During the 1920s and 1930s, many people were brought to the Brewarrina mission from places such as Tibooburra, Angledool, Goodooga, Culgoa, Collarenebri and Walgett as Aboriginal settlements in those towns were closed down. This centralisation of Aboriginal communities resulted in the Brewarrina mission becoming the largest such institution in Australia until it was closed in 1966.Bell and Herring 2001 quoted in Rando, 2007, p42) Dray loads of stone continued to be taken from the fish traps during the 1920s, with even larger quantities of stone removed in later years for roadworks. Still at this time, the custom by which members of another tribe could only catch fish at the fish traps after gaining permission from a Ngemba Wayilwan elder was still recognized.Mathews 1985 quoted in Rando, 2007, p42 Floods also took their toll on the fish traps. Two large floods in the 1950s caused large parts of the fisheries to be covered in silt. Construction of the Brewarrina Weir, which was opened in 1971, resulted in the destruction of the remaining parts of the upstream set of fish traps. As part of the weir development, a 90m-long channel was built from the original fishway at the weir to the middle of the river course. This involved the removal of additional stones and the pouring of concrete in the river channel in order to back water up to the fishway.Mallen-Cooper 2002 quoted in Rando, 2007, p42 A single Aboriginal man, Cassidy Samuels, protested against the construction of the weir, chaining himself to the safety nets erected at the site during blasting works. For more than 160 years, the fish traps has endured deliberate and inadvertent destruction and suffered from the loss of traditional management and maintenance. Yet despite this, substantial elements of the fish traps and its significance to Aboriginal people have survived. =Recent years= Two attempts to reconstruct or repair sections of the fish traps have occurred in recent times. In the early 1970s the Brewarrina Council obtained a grant from the Directorate of Aboriginal Welfare to employ local Aboriginal people to restore parts of the fish traps. The work undertaken was not documented, though there are theories about which structures were possibly associated with this early reconstruction exercise. More of the contemporary stone wall structures may be the result of building work reportedly undertaken in recent years by children and adults wishing to privately reconstruct the fish traps.Rando, 2007, p52 Despite their imperfect condition, the Brewarrina Fish Traps / Baiame's Ngunnhu remain an inspirational destination for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike. Beyond its role as a tourism drawcard, the fish traps are also viewed by Aboriginal people as a teaching place, one that can contribute to cultural renewal, understanding and tolerance.Rando, 2007, p46 The Brewarrina Aboriginal Cultural Museum has been constructed on the south bank of the river near the fish traps, a free-form curvilinear building consisting of a series of earth-covered domes that represent traditional shelters or gunyas. Funded by a bicentennial grant, the museum was designed by the NSW Government Architect's office under project architect Olga Kosterin and officially opened in 1988. It won an Australian Institute of Architects Balcakett Award for regional architecture in 1991. The mission statement for the museum stated: :To preserve, develop and promote our ancient culture, heritage and tradition. To enlighten the broader community and most importantly our own young. To let them be made aware of their ancestors, let them be proud of their descendants, and let them know how they struggled, suffered and created happiness, so that we still survive in the driest continent on earth - knowing that through different governments and policies over the last 150 years we still have our own identity. This project Is about Aboriginal pride. In 1996, rebuilding to some of the walls that had been neglected over time took place by members of the Aboriginal community, particularly through Community Development Employment Projects. In 2000 the Brewarrina Fish Traps were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register (SHR) and in 2006 they were listed on the Australian National Heritage List (called by their Aboriginal name, 'Baiame's Ngunnhu\\"). In 2008, federal funding was announced for interpretation works, with $180,000 for \\"keeping place\\" works, alongside fish traps. Between 2006 and 2012, the NSW Department of Fisheries underwent an extensive local consultation process to build a new fishway in the Brewarrina weir just east of the fish traps to allow more indigenous fish to navigate the river upstream. In its final form as a curving rock stairway adjoining the weir and next to the south bank of the river at Weir Park, the fishway should not be confused with the traditional fish traps located some metres further downstream from the weir.  Description  Fish traps, 1893 The Brewarrina Aboriginal Fish Traps, also known as Baiame's Ngunnhu, consists of a series of dry-stone weirs and ponds arranged in the form of a stone net across the Barwon River in north west NSW. They occupy the entire length of a 400m-long rock bar that extends from bank to bank across the river bed. Here, the river is fast-flowing and shallow, descending 3.35m over a set of four low rapidsDargin 1976 quoted in Rando, 2007, p21 In 1994 Hope and Vines summarized the known characteristics of the fish trap construction. The construction methods display sophistication and economy with rocks placed tightly together, often with their length across the wall rather than along it. The result is a knitting of the courses together, a method that provides greater strength. Further stability is gained by the technique of placing large stones along the tops of the walls, like capping stones on a dry stone wall. The curved forms of individual traps are also probably designed to enhance stability. The teardrop-shaped curves act as arches against the weight of the water with the tail sections following the lines of the currents.Hope and Vines 1994 quoted in Rando, 2007, p32 =Natural context= The fish traps are located in the Darling Riverine Plains Bioregion, a semi-arid area characterised by a hot and dry climate. The bioregion has undergone significant modification since the commencement of European occupation in the first half of the nineteenth century. Extensive areas within the bioregion have been cleared and the combination of droughts, overstocking of properties, the spread of weed species and changes to fire regimes have contributed to widespread land degradation. The poor state of the Barwon River, no different to the condition of most rivers in the bioregion, has impacted upon the integrity of the fish traps. The Barwon River Catchment occupies part of a large Cainozoic basin where flood plain sediments deposited by ancient rivers have buried the underlying bedrock in all but a few places, one of which is the fish traps. Light grey clay stained with the yellows and reds of iron oxide extends as a low cliff along the southern bank of the river downstream of the fish traps. This clay exposure was an important source of ochre for bodily decoration and other use by the Ngemba people. =Barwon River= The fish traps are situated at the southern edge of the Great Artesian Basin, the groundwater of which sustains the base flows of the rivers of the region. The Barwon River originates in the Great Dividing Range in south-east Queensland, north east of Brewarrina. Its headwaters feed the Macintyre River which marks a section of the Queensland / New South Wales state border. The Macintyre is known as the Barwon River downstream of the town of Mungindi. The river changes names once again at its confluence with the Culgoa River, some 80 km downstream of the fish traps, to become the Darling RiverCrabb 1997 quoted in Rando, 2007, p44 The Barwon River is classified as a controlled river with reduced flow. The reduced flow volumes and variability are primarily due to upstream harvesting and extraction of surface water and groundwater for agricultural purposes. Key water quality problems in the river include contamination with agricultural pesticides, high concentrations of nutrients and salt, the large quantity of suspended sediments present and the occurrence of algal blooms.Breckwoldt et. al. 2004 quoted in Rando, 2007, p54-55 The degraded state of the Barwon River is reflected in the listing of the aquatic ecological community of the natural drainage system of the lowland catchment of the Darling-Barwon River as an endangered ecological community.Rando, 2007, p55 Sources of river impairment exist within the curtilage itself. The Brewarrina sewerage plant outfall pipe discharges into the river near the ochre beds while the concrete form of the Brewarrina Weir dominates the upstream end of the traps. =Modification of natural context= Sections of the southern bank have been highly modified through the construction or placement of a range of soil stabilization and flood mitigation measures. These include the: * formation of earth banks; * laying of rows of sandbags (filled with sand and cement); * use of rock-filled gabions; * covering of an entire section of slope with imported rocks (wire- covered with concrete edges); * installation of steel section and concrete retaining walls at river level; * use of rows of concrete blocks; * laying of geotextile sheeting; * placement of granite boulders in the river channel; * construction of a concrete flood levee wall running along the top of the bank.Rando, 2007, p54 and * construction of a fishway largely constructed of stone boulders through on the southern end of the weir. Little archaeological material is likely to remain in situ on the southern bank of the river due to the highly disturbed nature of this area. Parts of the southern bank within the curtilage have previously served as a rubbish tip and a landscaped park, while a series of major bank stabilisation works has resulted in the importation of new material and the removal or burial of the original soil layer. =Weir= The Brewarrina Weir, or Darling Weir Number 15, is a 1.2m high fixed crest structure built at the head of the rock bar upon which the Fish traps are situated. Officially opened on 20 August 1971, the weir was built to provide a domestic water supply for the township of Brewarrina. Sixteen irrigators also extract water from the weir pool which extends upstream for a distance of approximately 100 km. The weir has adversely impacted upon the integrity of the fish traps, and on the ecology of the river. Apart from the direct physical damage to the upstream set-of fish traps, construction of the weir has altered the flow of the river and the natural processes of sediment erosion, transportation and deposition. The weir evenly distributes water flow across the river channel except at low flows when the fishway installed at the time of construction channels water to the northern side of the river.Mallen-Cooper 2002; NSW DPI 2006 quoted in Rando, 2007, p55 By contrast, the natural, low-flow of the river followed a channel near the southern bank. This change of flow patterns has resulted in the formation of silt banks that have buried portions of the fish traps. The presence of the weir has also reduced the occurrence of small river height rises that naturally flush the system. The rocks of the fish traps are often covered with algae and the trapping of fine sediments and nutrients behind the weir has led to an increased incidence of blue-green algal blooms in the weir pool. The still water habitats created by the weir are more suited to introduced fish species, such as carp, than native fish. The Brewarrina Weir was constructed with a submerged orifice fishway which proved to be too steep for native Australian fish to negotiate. A new fishway with a less steep design, resembling a stairway of rocks, was installed on the weir in 2012. =Built context associated with the fish traps= The recreational and educational centrepiece at the fish traps is the Brewarrina Aboriginal Cultural Museum. The building, designed by the NSW Government Architect's Office with project architect Olga Kosterin, won a Blacket Award for regional architecture in 1991. The design of the Brewarrina Aboriginal Cultural Museum precinct is empathetic and commensurate with the significance of the place. The red soil and granite rocks within the precinct were imported in order to establish a bush tucker educational area. Various other visitor facilities are also located along the southern bank of the river within the curtilage. A large number and variety of signs have also been erected along the southern bank of the river. Most of this infrastructure is situated in Weir Park and was installed by the Brewarrina Shire Council during the 1970s and 1990s. An old tractor is also located in the park.Rando, 2007, p47 The tractor and most of the signage may be considered intrusive to the significance of the place. Much of the northern bank of the river is owned by the Brewarrina Local Aboriginal Land Council, which has built several residences there. The northern bank has been damaged through clearing, grazing and the movement of livestock, vehicles and people. Despite this, surveys of the Barwon Four Aboriginal Reserve have revealed 250 archaeological sites including burial grounds, open campsites, scarred trees and middens. The two traditional burial grounds located here are surrounded by protective fences, though bone fragments and stone artefacts are scattered throughout the area. Visitor facilities are not provided on the northern bank of the river.Rando, 2007, p48 = Condition = As at 23 July 2013, the fish traps have been considerably damaged in the past. In the mid 1860s a crossing was built by European settlers at the upstream end of the fish traps by filling holes with stones from the traps and moving other stones to provide the ford that bullock drays could use. Stones from the traps were also moved to enable navigation of river craft, and in the 1920s dray loads of stone were removed for building foundations of buildings in the town. Construction of the Brewarrina weir on the Barwon River in the mid 1960s further disturbed the remains of the fish traps at the upstream end. The weir has adversely impacted on the cultural integrity of the fish traps and on the ecology of the river. The weir, and the fishway that was included in the original construction, also changed the flow pattern through the traps. The weir evenly distributed flow across the river where beforehand it followed a channel near the south-east bank. The fishway also channelled low flows to the north side of the river. Prevention of fish migration by weirs and dams is a major reason for the decline in native fish populations in the Murray-Darling river system. Surveys of the remaining structures of the fish traps were conducted in 1991 and 1993 as part of the conservation planning study-undertaker by Jeanette Hope and Gary Vines (1994). The first of these surveys revealed that there were significant distortions in the plan of the fisheries prepared by Mullen in 1906, due to him apparently drawing in details of the walls and traps by eye. High water levels during the 1993 fieldwork prevented the second survey from being completed. Utilising these two surveys and low level aerial photographs dating from 1980 and colour and infrared photographs taken in 1991, Hope and Vines made the following observations concerning the remaining early structures of the fisheries: * Many walls and traps shown on the 1906 plan no longer exist; * Of the four original sets of traps, evidence of three sets remains visible (No evidence remains of the upstream set); * Of the original 1.8 km of walls (of traps, yards and connecting walls), 750m survive in some form; * Only 5 per cent of the original system survives in a substantially intact form, that is, the stone structures are still standing on their original alignments and possibly to their original heights; and * Some traces of approximately 50 per cent of the traps and walls shown on the early plans and photographs remain.Rando, 2007, p48-49 There is unlikely to have been significant changes to the condition of the early structures of the fish traps since the early 1990s, as most of the surviving walls appear to be in a stable state of collapse. That said, minor displacements and rearrangements of rocks are likely to have occurred, largely through the activities of children playing and fishing in the river. Conversely, some of the silt banks currently found at the fish traps are relatively recent formations and it is possible that additional parts of the fish traps still exist beneath these deposits. However, despite these impacts much of the fish traps remains, particularly at the downstream end. There is great potential to rehabilitate the individual traps to their original condition.  Heritage listing  =NSW= The traditional Aboriginal fish traps at Brewarrina, also known as Baiame's Ngunnhu [pronounced By-ah-mee's noon-oo], comprises a nearly half-kilometre long complex of dry-stone walls and holding ponds within the Barwon River in north west NSW. The fish traps are the largest group recorded in Australia and are arranged in an unusual and innovative way that allowed fish to be herded and caught during both high and low river flows. According to Aboriginal tradition, the ancestral creation being, Baiame, generated the design by throwing his net over the river and, with his two sons Booma-ooma-nowi and Ghinda-inda-mui, building the fish traps to this design. Ngemba people are the custodians of the fishery and continue to use and have responsibilities for the fish traps. It is said that Baiame instructed these responsibilities to be shared with other Traditional Owner groups who periodically gathered in large numbers at the fish traps for subsistence, cultural and spiritual reasons. The place is extremely significant to the Aboriginal people of western and northern NSW for whom it is imbued with spiritual, cultural, traditional and symbolic meanings. The creation of the fish traps, and the laws governing their use, helped shape the spiritual, political, social, ceremonial and trade relationships between Aboriginal groups from across the greater landscape. The site was one of the great Aboriginal meeting places of eastern Australia. The bedrock outcrop upon which the traps are built is a rare geological exposure in an expansive alluvial basin. Study of the outcrop has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the Australian landscape. Brewarrina Aboriginal Fish Traps was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 August 2000 having satisfied the following criteria: The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Brewarrina Aboriginal fish traps is the largest system of traditional fish traps recorded in Australia. Its unusual, innovative and complex design demonstrates the development of a highly skilled fishing technique involving a thorough understanding of dry stone wall construction principles, river hydrology and fish biology. It is evidence of a distinctive way of life that is no longer practised today. Baiame, an ancestral being, is understood by many Aboriginal people from NSW to be responsible for the design and traditional use of these fish traps. According to Aboriginal tradition, Baiame generated the design by throwing his net over the river and, with his two sons Booma-ooma-nowi and Ghinda-inda-mui, building the fish traps to this design. Neighbouring tribes were invited to the fish traps to join in great corroborees, initiation ceremonies, and meetings for trade and barter. The fish traps indicate how a common understanding of this ancestral being influenced the social, cultural and spiritual interactions between a number of Aboriginal groups in relation to a major built structure on one group's land. Because of the fish traps, this place was one of the great Aboriginal meeting places of eastern Australia. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The fish traps are significant for their technical, creative and design excellence as well as for technical achievement. They are an unusually large and innovative construction from pre-European Aboriginal technology. The stone-walled pens, designed to withstand the high water flows of the Barwon River, are tear-drop shaped with the convex wall facing upstream. Some of the pen walls are higher than others enabling their use during both low and high water flows. This is combined with pond gates set at different locations enabling fish to be caught as they migrated both upstream and downstream. The structure of the fish traps demonstrates the development of an efficient method for catching fish involving a thorough understanding of dry stone wall construction techniques, river hydrology and fish ecology. The fish traps are an essential landmark in this Aboriginal community's sense of place. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place is extremely significant to the Aboriginal people of western and northern NSW for whom it is imbued with spiritual, cultural, traditional and symbolic meanings. While the Ngemba people are the custodians of the fish traps, it is understood to have been Baiame's wish that other tribes in the region, including the Morowari, Paarkinji, Weilwan, Barabinja, Ualarai and Kamilaroi should use it in an organised way. It is said that particular traps were allocated to each family group who were then responsible under Aboriginal law for their use and maintenance. The spiritual influence of the fish traps on the Aboriginal people who built and used them is demonstrated across western NSW through story association as well as related artwork. The fish traps were and remain an important meeting place for Aboriginal people with connections to the area. The fisheries are also valued by contemporary Aboriginal community as a highly visible symbol of traditional life and ownership of country. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The fish traps offer great potential for researching how Aboriginal people occupied this part of the country before colonisation. The place is understood to have been an important meeting place and ceremonial site for different Aboriginal groups in the region. The fish traps provide an important opportunity for Aboriginal children, visitors and researchers to understand and appreciate the culture of Aboriginal people of western NSW. Aside from the obvious Aboriginal significance, the Fisheries are built on a bedrock outcrop which is a rare geological exposure along the Darling River system which reveals evidence of past landscape history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Aboriginal fishery at Brewarrina (Ngunnhu) is rare in being a dry-stone fish trap located on a large river system and the largest fish trap recorded in NSW and Australia. It features a complex design that exploits an unusual location. Aboriginal people used the unusual combination of a large rock bar, seasonal river flows and suitable local rocks to develop the fish traps, nearly half a kilometre long. The size, design and complexity of these fish traps is exceptional in Australia. The role of an ancestral being (Baiame) in creating built structures is also rare in Aboriginal society and adds to the significance of the fish traps. There are only four other fish traps recorded in NSW of which three are only exposed in drought conditions and are eroded almost to invisibility. =National= The fish traps were added to the Australian National Heritage List on 3 June 2005.

He helped to establish the Tonantzintla Observatory and he later directed it. He received the National Prize for Arts and Sciences in 1970. Biography Graef Fernández was born in Guanaceví, Durango, where his father was a mining engineer. He had two younger siblings; his brother Hermann became an accomplished physician. He attributed an early interest in science to a physics book that his mother gave him as a child. Graef Fernández first studied at a German school in Mexico, then went to Technische Hochschule Darmstadt (today Technische Universität Darmstadt) in the German city of Darmstadt for a couple of years before returning to Mexico. He completed his undergraduate education at UNAM, and he was influenced by UNAM scientists Manuel Sandoval Vallarta and Sotero Prieto, who each mentored several successful Mexican scientists. Awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and other assistance, including a stipend awarded by Mexican president Lázaro Cárdenas, Graef Fernández went to MIT. Around that time, he married Alicia Sánchez Castell and they later had three children. He completed a doctorate at MIT in 1940 and worked at Harvard University. At Harvard, Graef Fernández met Luis Enrique Erro, who invited him to join the effort to found the Tonantzintla Observatory in the Mexican state of Puebla. In The Skin of the Sky, Graef Fernández is described as \\"small, round and prone to a cordiality that made him lovable\\"; he seemed an unlikely partner for Erro, who was a slender, elegant man with a hearing aid. Ultimately, Graef Fernández was more interested in studying gravitational issues than astrophysics, so he sought an academic position. He joined the UNAM faculty, where he directed the Institute of Physics and the Faculty of Sciences. Graef Fernández organized the meeting that led to the establishment of the Mexican Mathematical Society in 1943. He was also a founding member of the Mexican Physical Society in 1951.

He was a graded stakes winning, three-time champion jockey who competed in North American horse racing from 1982 to 2012. In 1983, he was the top apprentice jockey in the U.S. for wins, and was second in the nation for earnings with over $2 million in purse money. As an apprentice, Vega won back to back riding titles at the (Keystone Park Winter-Spring meet (55 wins) & Monmouth Park Racetrack (134 wins), the first rider in Monmouth Park history to win 100 races in a season, the first apprentice jockey to win the riding title at Monmouth, the first jockey to lead the standings at three different racetracks at the same time (Keystone Park, Monmouth Park & Meadowlands Racetrack), and the first jockey to win six races in one day at Monmouth. Vega also broke twenty records that year, and became the first jockey to win the New Jersey Sports Writers Association's \\"Pro Rookie of The Year\\" award, along with being awarded the 1983 New Jersey Racing Writers \\"Apprentice Jockey of The Year\\" and being honored as Thoroughbred racing's representative at the 18th annual Philadelphia Sports Writers Association's awards ceremony. He finished second that year in the voting for the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey, and was ranked 7th overall for wins in the U.S. and 29th on the list for earnings. Tony Vega had never landed any mounts in any of The American classic races such as The Kentucky Derby, Triple Crown or, Breeders Cup but, Vega did compete in some of the most prestigious races in American horse racing during his time, Such as, “The 1983 Sapling” & “The Sorority stakes at Monmouth Park (Major stakes preps for 2yr old horses), “The 1984 “Black Eyed Susan” (Pimlico) Major Grade 1 stake race for fillies in the U.S. run annually the day before The Preakness Stakes, “The 1985 United Nations Handicap (Atlantic City Racecourse) A key turf race in the U.S. won by Several American Turf Champions, The 1988 Grade 1 inaugural running of “The NYRA MILE” (Key Triple Crown prep for 3yr old’s on the derby trail, Now known as The Cigar Mile) (Aqueduct Racetrack), and, “The 1993 Young America Stakes Gr.2(Meadowlands Racetrack). Early life Vega was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey to Carmen and Pedro Vega, who moved to New Jersey from Puerto Rico in the 1950s. Tony Vega was a top wrestler at New Brunswick High School in the late 1970s and a champion amateur boxer before becoming a jockey. He did not have a racing background and had planned to become a professional boxer before he started his professional riding career in 1982. Vega trained under Marty Fallon at Pennsylvania's Keystone Racetrack. Vega was also a self-taught martial arts student who studied Jeet Kune Do, an eclectic hybrid martial art, heavily influenced by the philosophy of Bruce Lee. He was very active in the community and is remembered as tough, tiny, but tenacious kid who knew nothing about horse racing or becoming a jockey, until the day he met liquor salesman at the Uptown Cafe in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Vega shined shoes and worked as a dishwasher at the pub where one day, On the first Saturday in May, fans packed the pub to watch legendary jockey Angel Cordero Jr. guide Bold Forbes to victory in the 1976 Kentucky Derby. Vega made an idle boast while watching Cordero celebrate after his derby victory saying, \\"I could be just as good as him if I had the chance\\". A liquor salesman overheard him and took him seriously, introducing Vega to trainer Martin L. Fallon, who was known for bringing up young contract riders and teaching them everything there was to know about being a horseman before he allowed them to gallop horses in the morning and then become jockeys. Career =1980s= Vega won his first race aboard Laudo at Keystone Park in Pennsylvania (now known as Parx Casino and Racing) on April 12, 1982, before going on a tear and winning 55 races en route to winning his first riding title during Keystone's winter-spring meet in 1983. Vega then moved his tack to New Jersey, taking Monmouth Park by storm. He became the winningest rider in Monmouth Park with 134 wins in a season, surpassing Don MacBeth's mark of 99 wins in a season, and breaking Jimmy Edwards record of 123 victories in a season established during an extended meet in 1975. Vega became the first apprentice jockey ever to win Monmouth's riding title and, the first jockey to win 100 races in a single meet. Vega also won six races in a day on May 18, 1983 (five wins at Monmouth and one at Atlantic City Race Course later that night, and five races in a day twice in 1983. He was one of the first ever to do so. Vega also won three or more races in a day at Monmouth more than twenty times that summer, something that had only been done three times before. In 1983, the Philadelphia Inquirer described Vega as the \\"leading apprentice\\" at Pennsylvania's Keystone Racetrack. He had the most wins of any apprentice jockey in the U.S., and was second in the nation for earnings. Vega finished 7th in the \\"U.S. Top 100\\" jockey standings for wins that year, and by the end of the season, finished second in the Eclipse Awards voting for \\"Outstanding Apprentice Jockey of The Year\\", edged for the national award in a split decision to Declan Murphy. Vega was honored as Thoroughbred Racing's representative at the 18th annual Philadelphia Sportswriters Association's awards, won the 1983 New Jersey Racing Writers \\"Apprentice Jockey Of The Year\\" award and, the 1984 New Jersey Sports Writers Association's \\"Pro Rookie of The Year\\" award, becoming the first jockey ever to win the award. In 1984, after winning back-to-back riding titles and breaking twenty records as an apprentice, Vega began his career as a journeyman and one of the most promising jockeys in the nation. He was the leading jockey at Keystone Park for part of the meet before he moving his tack to Maryland after his falling out with his mentor, trainer Marty L. Fallon. Vega also had constant issues with the Monmouth Park Racetrack stewards, and felt that he was being targeted by Sam Boulmetis Sr., because of his reputation off of the racetrack. In addition to becoming one of the nation's top riders, Vega was known as a no-nonsense kind of guy, with swift hands on a horse, and quick fist's in the jockey's room. He had been nicknamed \\"The Baby Animal\\" as a teenager because of his size and attitude, and on the racetrack he was nicknamed \\"Tony Vee, The Honey Bee\\" because of his rendition of Muhammad Ali's famous poem, \\"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\\" moniker that he used around the racetrack. Vega was a popular figure and fan favorite on the East Coast racetrack's, known for his charismatic personality and his strong and stylish finishes during races. Vega won the majority of his races aboard long shots and cheap horse's, rarely riding stakes race caliber horse's. Vega had a deft touch, and an uncanny ability to get horses to run the race of their lives's whenever he was aboard. Down the stretch, Vega out rode some of the greatest jockeys of all time from the quarter pole home very often. In 1985, Garden State Park Racetrack re-opened, and Vega, who was also riding regularly at Bowie Racetrack, Timonium, Laurel, and Pimlico, began working double duty and driving back and forth to New Jersey to ride at Atlantic City, the Meadowlands, and Garden State Park at night. He did this after working horses in the mornings, and riding races during the afternoon in Maryland, and on certain day's driving to New Jersey to ride the night cards. Vega won races at every track that he competed at that year. Although his business had slowed down, Vega continued to win races at a steady clip and made the best of every opportunity presented to him. On June 17, 1985, Vega was called on to replace veteran Jockey Craig Perret on a mare named Forest Maiden at Garden State Park Racetrack. Vega and Forest Maiden went on to win the race that night in impressive fashion. On June 22, 1985, Vega was named back on Forest Maiden and scored another victory on the mare, squeezing through on the rail for a come from behind victory in the \\"Ambassador Of Luck Handicap\\" at Monmouth Park Racetrack in New Jersey. After winning several races aboard Forest Maiden and several other horses for trainer Joe Pierce, Vega was named on a horse named Evzone in the first running of the All- American Handicap at Garden State Park. Vega and Evzone went on to win, establishing a new track record in the process, and finishing the 1 1/16 miles (Turf) in 1:41 1/5 seconds. On July 13, 1985, Vega scored his third victory aboard Forest Maiden in the first running of the 1 1/16 mile Philadelphia Handicap at Garden State Park, finishing the race in 1:42 1/5 seconds. His success on the racetrack continued until the passing of his younger brother, Reynaldo Vega, who was only 24 years old at the time, which forced him to eventually quit riding at the peak of his career to take care of his family. In 1988, Vega returned to the saddle at Calder Race Course in Florida, before moving his tack to New York to compete against a riding colony which included some of the best jockeys in the country. Days before opening day at Aqueduct Racetrack, the New York jockeys decided to go on strike after fellow jockey Mike Venezia was killed during a racing accident at Belmont Park. Vega rode and won at Aqueduct during the strike. Riding against the strike upset several of the country's top riders including Jerry Bailey, Jean Cruget, Jorge Velásquez and other's, but by riding during the strike, Vega picked up mounts that gave him the two biggest wins of his career. Vega won the 1988 Ashley T. Cole Handicap aboard Tinchens Prince by a nose in dramatic fashion for owner Albert Fried, and The Grade 3 Martha Washington aboard timely Business. Vega also won an allowance race during the strike on a filly named Timely Business, and was asked by trainer John O. Hertler to ride the filly back, because he'd never seen the horse respond to a rider the way she did when Vega rode her. On November 12, 1988, Vega decided to take off all of his other mounts that he was scheduled to ride that day, and flew to Laurel Park in Maryland with trainer John O. Hertler to ride just one race aboard Timely Business. Timely Business was an unaccomplished filly who had just came back off a layoff due to a fracture, and was entered in the 1988 Martha Washington Handicap at Laurel Park after her impressive allowance victory at Aqueduct two weeks prior. Another jockey who rode in The Martha Washington, was Hall of Fame Jockey Jean Cruget, best known for winning the Triple Crown aboard Seattle Slew. Cruget tried to intimidate Vega in the jockey's room before the race, but Vega did not back down and had the last word by winning the race easily, paying $58 to win. Other prominent riders who rode in the race were Hall of Fame jockeys Julie Krone and Kent Desormeaux, Greg MacCaron, Vincent Braciale (rider of champion filly Ruffian), Nick Santagata, Mario Pino, and others. =1990s= In the early 1990s, Vega teamed up with trainer Gene Lotti and had a great run up and down the East coast, winning races wherever they competed. In 1993, Vega picked up a mount named Shanannies Boss, who was a tough, and rambunctious chestnut horse who liked to run off with riders in the mornings during training. That was until Vega began to gallop him in the mornings. Vega made a deal with owner Frank Generazio, that he would tame the horse and help get him ready for the races, only if he would be allowed to ride him come race time. Vega went on to win \\"The World Appeal Stakes\\" at Meadowlands Racetrack (October 9, 1993) for owner and trainer Patricia and Frank Generazio. After Vega's last winning season in 1993, he gradually moved away from the racetrack, riding occasionally to stay in shape, and to please his wife, children, and fans who had always encouraged Vega to continue riding. =2000s= Vega made several comebacks, winning at Atlantic City Racecourse in 1996, at Garden State Park in 1998, and in 2005 at Monmouth Park (NJ), and at Aqueduct Racetrack (NY). Vega won several races before he stopped riding to take care of his family, and spend more time with his children. In 2010, Tony Vega launched his final comeback and had a few heartbreaking losses, before coming back to win, and visit the winners circle for the last time at Monmouth Park on July 4, 2010, aboard Machismo for trainer Andrew Amonte. It was a special win for the Vega family as, Tony Vega's two son's worked with Machismo in the mornings, along with former jockey, and close friend of Vega's, Andy Amonte (Trainer of Machismo) and his son, who ran the family operation in New Jersey, and claimed/ trained Machismo during Monmouth Park Racetrack's Summer Elite Meet in 2010. Tony Vega was Machismo's regular exercise rider in the mornings leading up to his huge upset victory that day. On the morning of November 11, 2013 (Veterans Day), while preparing for work, Vega suffered a heart attack and died in his home in New Jersey.

It was the first union to represent unskilled workers formed in Western Australia. The union was formed in 1889 to represent unskilled workers on the Fremantle wharves when the Adelaide Lumpers' Union started a recruiting drive to the west. Many workers joined, thought to be inspired by the London Dock strike of 1889 and the solidarity shown between the workers. The inaugural secretary of the union was Mr. Clifford. The president of the Union in 1890 was Arthur James Diamond, the vice-president was T. Smith, and the secretary was J. Scott. Diamond left the union in 1891 to head to the eastern states of Australia. J.P. Rasmussen was the secretary of the union in 1895. The lumpers went on strike in 1899 as a result of non- union labour being used on the wharf; the strike lasted for over four weeks. Rasmussen remained as secretary until 1899 when he left the position. The union was involved in the 1919 Fremantle Wharf riot when the state had been isolated by an outbreak of the influenza virus and a waterside workers strike. Premier Hal Colebatch, had intervened in a dispute involving the unloading of a coastal trader, . The violence escalated when Lumpers Union members threw missiles at a launch carrying Colebatch and strikebreakers who were attempting to start unloading the vessel. Police retaliated and shots were fired. During the violence a lumper named Tom Edwards was fatally injured and died three days later. In 1910 the Lumpers Union joined the Waterside Workers' Federation but broke way again in 1933 following a dispute with the Federation executive over collection of union dues. They reaffiliated in 1946. In Fremantle Cemetery there are 39 headstones that were erected by, or with assistance from, the Union.

Senile plaques are extracellular aggregations of amyloid-b (Aβ) protein. Neurofibrillary tangles are collections of hyperphosphorylated tau protein associated with microtubules found within neurons. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are widespread throughout brain tissue and mirror other pathological changes associated with AD.  Alzheimer’s Disease and the Cell Cycle  Neurons typically remain in G0, a nondividing, nonreplicating phase of the cell cycle. Neurons subject to loss of synaptic connections, chronic exposure to oxidative stress or stress hormones like glucocorticoids will exit G0 and reenter into a cell cycle that is abortive and leads to cell death through apoptosis. The G0 to G1 transition in neurons is normally only observed for stressed neurons about to undergo apoptosis. Upon entering G1, these stressed neurons will be arrested at the G1 checkpoint by the absence of cyclin E1 and/or the inhibition of the cyclin-E1–CDK2 complex by p21, p27, and p53. Next, the absence of cyclin A1 commits the neuron to division, but the cell lacks the ability to re-differentiate. Since the cell is unable to complete the cell cycle, it dies via apoptosis (Meikrantz et al., 1995). In the past decade, research has shown that neuronal cell cycle reentry plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of AD. The cell cycle hypothesis of AD proposes that the disease is caused by aberrant re-entry of different neuronal populations into the cell division cycle, following a 2-hit hypothesis (Nagy et al. 1998). The cell cycle hypothesis of AD also attempts to explain for the characteristic senile plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles of AD pathology. The intracellular accumulation of highly phosphorylated tau is linked to the cell cycle and cell cycle dependent kinases (McShea et al., 2007). Other aberrations in cell cycle dynamics influence cell senescence, oxidative stress, and misregulated apoptosis (Franco et al., 2006). In particular, it is clear that oxidative stress is a pervasive feature in AD at all stages (Zhu et al., 2005). Thus, the cell-cycle hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease considers AD as a disease of deregulation of the cell cycle in neurons.  The 2-hit hypothesis of AD  The cell-cycle hypothesis of AD proposes a 2-hit hypothesis that results in neuron “immortality,” and continual production of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles to cause AD. # Neurons are able to leave G0 quiescence and enter a permanent, steady-state G1 phase # Neurons lose the ability to undergo apoptosis. = Hit One: Abnormal G0 to G1 transition in AD neurons = Many subscribers to the 2-hit hypothesis of AD argue that the best strategy towards AD prevention appears to be the prevention of neurons from leaving G0 phase and entering the abnormal G1 associated with AD. They propose targeting upstream mitogenic pathways prior to the G0/G1 transition to prevent pre-AD neurons from more vulnerability to additional insults capable of triggering excessive Aβ and tau production in AD neurons.  Abnormal localization of G0/G1 transition markers  Cell cycle markers cyclin D, Cdk4, and Ki67 are found in elevated levels in AD neurons, signifying the transition to G1 (McShea et al. 1997; Zhu et al. 2007). These markers are normally found in the nucleus, where they are needed for expression of key genes that allow the diseased neuron to continue to G1, and eventually, apoptosis (Vincent et al. 1997). However, these markers are found in high levels in the cytoplasm of AD neurons rather than the nucleus, suggesting prevention of the normal apoptotic pathway.  Abnormal response to oxidative injury  Acute oxidative injury in most mature neurons will induce the neurons to enter G1 along an apoptotic pathway. However, in the AD brain, neurons do not show signs of apoptosis as would be expected under conditions of acute oxidative stress (Perry et al., 1998). Instead, it is proposed that after being subjected to oxidative injury, AD neurons possess genetic defects which allow them to enter and stay in G1 instead of proceeding towards apoptosis. This adaptive response produces an “oxidative steady state” in the AD neuron, characterized by relatively low intracellular concentrations of oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide which explains the reduced levels of neuronal apoptosis (Wiese et al. 1995). Persistent oxidative stress in pre-AD and AD cases may result in an irreversible oxidative steady state, in which neurons which have neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) can survive for decades (Morsch et al., 1999). AD NFT-bearing neurons have been shown to under or over-expression of over 225 genes which have protein products involved in oxidative stress (Dunckley et al., 2006). Chronic oxidative stress also inhibits the downstream propagation of caspase-mediated apoptotic signals, which is the second hit in the 2-hit hypothesis of AD (Hampton et al. 1998). There is evidence that Aβ has antioxidant properties (Hayashi et al. 2007; Nakamura et al. 2007; Moreira et al. 2008). Therefore, oxidative damage and subsequent “stuck” AD neurons could be induced to activate a compensatory response involving activation of a- and g-secretases to produce more Aβ for neutralization of future free radicals (Tamagno et al. 2002, 2005; Kim and Shen 2008). Increased density of Aβ plaque deposition in the AD brain is associated with decreased levels of neuronal oxidative damage, suggesting a compensatory role of Aβ in response to oxidative injury (Pratico et al., 2001). = Hit Two: Lost apoptotic ability in AD neurons = Several studies presently indicate that apoptosis might occur in, and contribute to, AD onset and progression. Stimuli for apoptosis in AD include increased oxidative stress, dysregulation of ion homeostasis, growth factor deprivation, accumulation of Aβ, metabolic impairment, reduced clearance of toxin, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, protein aggregation. Despite a growing number of studies underlying caspases and apoptosis involvement in AD, no direct role of apoptotic death in AD etiology has still been proven although the presence of apoptotic bodies, DNA fragmentation, granulated and marginated chromatin and shrunken and irregular cell shapes have been largely reported in tissue sections of brains from affected patients.  Reduced caspase activation  AD neurons which exit G0 and enter G1 do not activate the full set of caspases required for neuronal apoptosis (Raina et al. 2001). Instead, AD neurons have increased expression of upstream caspases 8 and 9 while keeping control levels of downstream caspases 3, 6, and 7 (Raina et al. 2001). This result suggests that AD neurons often result in “abortosis,” the concept of apoptotic avoidance and neuronal survival. This “abortosis” may be due to AD neurons receiving apoptotic signals but failing to propagate these signals to downstream caspase effectors (Raina et al. 2000, 2001). Staining of neurons from AD brain autopsy tissue shows that 5-10% of neurons are incompatible with a cell death process that is apoptosis-like, suggesting loss of apoptotic ability compared to control and resulting neurons being stuck in the cell cycle (Yang et al., 2003). The same study also detected hundreds of times the levels of these “stuck” neurons compared to a control, suggesting that these abnormal neurons have aggregated and built up over a period of several months up to one year. This aggregation of AD neurons exacerbates production of Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau.  Liberation of E2F1 localization  Additionally, the E2F1 transcription factor in the AD brain is found primarily in the cytoplasm rather than its normal location in the nucleus. E2F1 normally regulates neuronal cell death induced by DNA damage, suggesting that the liberation of E2F1 from the nucleus exacerbates the loss of apoptosis in the AD brain (Scuitto et al. 2002).  Proposed relationship between the cell- cycle hypothesis of AD and Aβ and Tau  There is some evidence that cell cycle re-entry depends upon tau hyper-phosphorylation. Studies using mouse models have shown that tau mislocalization to the cytoplasm induces abnormal cell cycle alterations. In particular, studies using a tauopathy mouse model confirmed that disease-causing tau mutations can cause cell cycle abnormalities in mammalians (Delobel et. a, 2006). Genetic studies in Drosophila models also demonstrate that tau defects cause neuronal cell cycle activation (Khurana et al., 2006). There is also evidence of Aβ serving a function in cell cycle control (Zhu et al., 2004). AD may be an outcome of extreme compensatory adaptations in pre-AD neurons, which have Aβ mutations and extensive changes in expression of genes involved in neuronal outgrowth and energy metabolism and nucleotide and protein synthesis. Consequently, pre- AD neurons are more vulnerable to additional insults (Vercauteren et al. 2004). However, there is still controversy regarding the role of Aβ in the neuronal cell cycle, since a previous study with Aβ mutant mice did not detect any neuronal cell cycle abnormalities (Gartner et al., 2003).

A controversial figure, Zwane became the Minister of Mineral Resources on 23 September 2015 after succeeding Ngoako Ramathlodi. Zwane is also a member of the Portfolio Committee on Small Business Development and a Member of Portfolio on Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Zwane resigned on 25 February 2018 following allegations of state capture and in particular his role in the Vrede Dairy Project, which helped bankroll the Gupta Family wedding. Zwane is currently the chairperson of the parliamentary committee on transport. Career Born in Vrede, South Africa, Zwane got involved in political career in the early 1980s as a member of the Thembelihle Youth Congress. He later joined the Thembelihle African National Congress (ANC) branch. Zwane also served in the regional executive committee of the Frankfort region in the early 1990s. He became the first secretary of the Frankfort region that became the Thabo Mofutsunyana region, preceding the amalgamation of local councils. Mosebenzi Zwane became a regional executive committee member of the Thabo Mofutsunyana region and subsequently its chairperson. Zwane has been the regional chairperson of the Thabo Mofutsunyana ANC region since 2006. Zwane was a Member of Free State Legislature (provincial legislature) since 21 May 2014. He has previously served as MEC in the Portfolio of Agriculture and Rural Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs in the Free State provincial government. In 2015 Zwane was appointed by President Jacob Zuma to succeed Ngoako Ramathlodi as Minister of Mineral Resources. As for his Academic cursus, Mr Mosebenzi attained his secondary teacher's diploma from the South African Teachers College in Pretoria. He also holds a certificate in Executive Leadership Municipal Development from the University of Pretoria. Allegations of involvement in State Capture In August 2017, Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse laid charges of treason, corruption, extortion, fraud and theft against Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane in light of his unofficial, unethical and illegal relationship with the Gupta Family. Zwane‚ charged under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, was among the first of the known Gupta Family allies to have criminal charges laid against him. Zwane is accused of allowing the Gupta family to loot nearly R2-billion from South Africa's state coffers via the Vrede Dairy Project and two mine rehabilitation funds. Zwane is also accused of abusing his position of power as minister to the benefit of the Gupta family and their associates in the landing of their wedding guests at Air Force Base Waterkloof in April 2013. The Democratic Alliance laid criminal charges include racketeering, money laundering, assisting another to benefit from the proceeds of unlawful activities, and acquiring, possessing or using the proceeds of unlawful activities in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act (No 121 of 1998); and submitting false, or untrue, tax returns in terms of the Tax Administration Act (No 28 of 2011) against Zwane Zwane, Atul Gupta, Ajay Gupta, Rajesh Gupta and their business associates Ronica Ragavan and Kamal Vasram. In January 2018, the Hawks unit of South Africa's Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation seized R220 million that the Free State Department of Agriculture under Zwane had paid to the Gupta family in connection with the Vrede Dairy Project, calling it a \\"scheme designed to defraud and steal monies\\" from the Free State Department of Agriculture. The UK NGO Shadow World Investigations (formerly Corruption Watch UK) claimed that Mosebenzi Zwane, as MEC for agriculture in the Free State at the time, allegedly received benefits worth R500 000 from Gupta companies a month after a 99-year lease was signed with the Guptas for the Estina farm.

Kazuhisa was previously the drummer of the Japanese noise band Boredoms and is currently with the British electronic/post-rock band Seefeel. The duo cut a raw blend of drums, noise and organic visual work, featuring in their performances an eight-foot white sphere that hangs above Kazuhisa’s drum kit and which Dickinson maps videos on to; her work was described by William Barns-Graham of Fluid Radio as ‘cosmological and transcendental, drawing attention to the wonder of the earth and our sensuality on it’.  Career  Their debut was at the International Festival of Projections in early 2016, and they have since performed at the End of the Road Festival, Supernormal Festival, Fort Process Festival, Zorofest in Leipzig, Splice Festival and other shows across the UK and Europe with Acid Mothers Temple and members of Wire and Bo Ningen. In 2016, the pair completed a short film, Man on the Hill, which features Kazuhisa playing drums on fire in the mountains. The film has since been featured on the British Council Film website. In 2016 the film was nominated for the BFI London Film Festival, the Encounters Short Film and Animation Festival, the BAFTA qualifying Aesthetica Short Film Festival, The London Experimental Film Festival, Vienna Independent Short Film Festival and the London Short Film Festival. The film was also featured in i-D Magazine Japan, naming Dickinson as one of the five most watched filmmakers in Japan at the time. After completing Man on the Hill, they went on to release their first music video Toy, premiering on the Ransom Note in 2017 and following that appeared at various shows across the UK and Europe alongside the likes of Damo Suzuki (Can) and Immersion and Snapped Ankles, where their performance was described by Loud and Quiet as \\"it looked like a planet, a marble, the inside of a brain, or was filled by trapped insects and humans. The effect was transfixing, and comes highly recommended.\\" They are featured as one of Cafe Oto's artists, accompanied by a review from Gavin Burrows of the blog Lucid Frenzy which reads \\"The centre of the stage was taken up by projections which, always simple and often semi-abstract, never stole the limelight from the music. It was more like watching a trio, just one at work on different senses to the others. Pretty soon you weren't taking in the sights and sounds as separate elements at all, but hand been induced into a kind of synaesthesia. And if that seems like we're reverting to Sixties terminology like 'trip' we might as well go with it.... it felt like a trip (man), like being taken through some other reality then dumped back in ours at the end.\\" In January 2018 they performed 'Movements of a Nebulous Dawn' for the opening night of the London Short Film Festival at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, presenting a one-off audiovisual collaboration with a 360-degree nebulous orb defying the conventions of theatrical presentation as musicians performed in-the-round beneath multiple circular projections created by Dickinson. The improvised live set curated by Adrena Adrena featured guest musicians Damo Suzuki (Can), Geraldine Swayne (Faust), Colin Newman (Wire), Malka Spigel (Minimal Compact) and Kenichi Iwasa (Krautrock Karaoke).

The unit was based in the camp north-west of the white compound of Oshakati, but not part of the Sector HQ compound. It was surrounded by the familiar bulldozed soil walls. About all that could be seen of the 10 Armoured Squadron camp from the road was the steel hall building. Most of the troops seemed to be accommodated in tents. There were some brick buildings, which included a chaplain's work space and coffee bar. The senior officers had prefabricated offices. =Attack on Calueque Dam= The Cubans opened a second front on 27 June 1988 against the South Africans and launched a ground offensive in the direction of Calueque Dam in Southern Angola.

The first two parts of the film are lost. Plot The film's plot is based on the real murder of the Soviet diplomatic courier Theodor Nette abroad. The pouch of the Soviet diplomat, which is stolen by British spies, is taken away by the sailors of a ship sailing to Leningrad who deliver it to the authorities. The intelligence agents make every effort to retrieve the bag. Production Dovzhenko was invited to stage the film because of his knowledge of the diplomatic sphere; he also used to work as a diplomatic courier. Under the influence of the German cinema school, he fills the movie with clichés borrowed from German crime fiction: a brawl in the compartment of an international express train and on its steps, a fight on the deck of the ship, a steamer pursuing the boat, and so on. Many of the genre's stock characters appear: spies, prostitutes, police agents, visitors of port pubs, and jazz bands. At this time, cinematographer Nikolai Kozlovsky introduces Dovzhenko to cropping techniques. The film features images with a lot of unusual angles, night shooting and expressionistic effects (using optical prisms). Dovzhenko appears on screen, for the only time in his career, as a ship's stoker. In the film there is a scene where inspector White offers money to the stoker, who throws it back into his face. A very similar thing happened in Dovzhenko's life: once a man came to him for an appointment at work, who wanted monetary help because he suffered under the Bolsheviks. He even had with him a letter of recommendation written by the Empress Maria Feodorovna. After reading, Dovzhenko \\"neatly folded the sheets and threw them in the face of the degenerate\\", then banged his fist on the table and screamed. Reception \\"The Diplomatic Pouch\\" was made with high production values at the level typical of 1920s adventure films. It was well received by the audience, who watched it with pleasure and the film was in the cinemas for a long time and was also shown abroad. But Dovzhenko had not yet found his signature style; he called the film \\"a pathetic attempt at writing.\\" Cast *M. Buyukli as Embassy Secretary *A.
