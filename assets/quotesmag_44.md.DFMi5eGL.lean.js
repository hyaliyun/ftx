In 2005 the United States Congress granted the Department of Energy the authority to create these regions in an effort to speed the creation of more transmission capacity. Should state and local governments fail to issue permits allowing construction of new transmission, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) the authority to issue a federal permit empowering a project director to exercise the right of eminent domain to purchase property needed to complete the project. Background In the United States, electricity generation is growing four times faster than transmission, and energy sources that would make the U.S. more energy independent cannot be built because there is no transmission capacity to carry the power to consumers. Because United States energy independence is a national priority, this problem has attracted considerable federal attention. Historically, local governments have exercised authority over the electricity grid and have little incentive to take action that would benefit other states, but not their own. States with cheap electricity have a disincentive to make interstate commerce in electricity easier, since other states will be able to compete for local energy and drive up rates. Further, vocal local constituencies can block or slow permitting by pointing to visual impact, environmental, and perceived health concerns. Large transmission upgrades require coordination of multiple states, a multitude of interlocking permits, and a significant portion of the 500 companies that own the grid. From a policy perspective, the control of the grid is balkanized, and the former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson refers to it as a \\"third world grid\\". To address to the U.S. national security interest in significantly growing transmission capacity, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave the Department of Energy the authority to approve transmission if states refuse to act. However, soon after using its power to designate two national corridors, fourteen senators signed a letter stating the DOE was being too aggressive. Legislation Recognizing the impacts of transmission congestion, the inter-state nature of transmission needs, and the need to provide avenues for the facilitation of transmission capacity development, the US Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which added Section 216 to the Federal Power Act (FPA; New Deal era legislation) which directs the US Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct a transmission congestion study every three years. Based on the results of these studies, the Secretary of Energy may designate \\"any geographic area experiencing electric energy transmission capacity constraints or congestion that adversely affects customers as a national interest electric transmission corridor\\". Designation of a NIETC emphasizes that the DOE considers the congestion problem in question to be of a national concern and enables FERC to approve the siting of transmission projects within the corridor. 2006 National Electric Transmission Congestion Study The first study conducted by the Department of Energy was completed in 2006. The study developed and compiled metrics of electricity transmission performance related to the magnitude and impact of congestion (e.g. the number of hours per year where the transmission constraint is loaded to its maximum safe operating level, etc.). Based on this data, the DOE identified three categories of congested areas which have higher levels of transmission congestion for the Eastern Interconnection and the Western Interconnection (ERCOT is excluded from these studies as the system is not under the purview of federal authority; no interstate commerce). The study classified areas of concern into three categories: Critical Congestion Areas, Congestion Areas of Concern, and Conditional Congestion Areas. A Critical Congestion Area is an area which is \\"critically important to remedy existing or growing congestion problems because the current and/or projected effects of the congestion are severe.\\" Congestion Areas of Concern are areas where a \\"large-scale congestion problem exists or may be emerging, but more information and analysis appear to be needed to determine the magnitude of the problem and the likely relevance of transmission expansion and other solutions.\\" Conditional Congestion Areas are areas where there is \\"some transmission congestion at present, but significant congestions would result if large amounts of new generation resources were to be developed without simultaneous development of associated transmission capacity.\\" As a result of this study, the DOE moved forward with consideration of designating the two areas identified as Critical Congestion Areas (The Atlantic coastal area from metropolitan New York Southward through Northern Virginia; and in Southern California) as National Corridors in order to facilitate relief of transmission congestion. In order to begin the process, the DOE posed three initial questions to key transmission system stakeholders: # Would designation of one or more National Corridors in relation to these areas be more appropriate and in the public interest? # How and where should the DOE establish the geographic boundaries for a National Corridor? # To the extent a commenter is focusing on a proposed transmission project, how would the costs of the facility be allocated? Based on these discussions, the Secretary of Energy declared two National Corridors: the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest Area National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors in October 2007. Corridor designations of 2007 NIETC corridor designated for the Southwest Area in 2007 In 2007, the DOE designated two corridors, the Mid-Atlantic Area national corridor, and the Southwest Area corridor. Using a source-and-sink approach, the DOE determined areas of significant transmission network congestion and electricity demand (sink), then examined likely areas of nearby generation (source). The possible paths between these sources and sinks defined the highest priority regions where transmission lines need to be built. In designating an NIETC corridor, the DOE does not specify preferred routes for projects, just the general region where such projects are eligible for federal permits. Further, DOE did not exclude federal or state lands from the regions since right of eminent domain by a FERC permit would not apply to them. Although Congress did not specify that national corridors expire, the Secretary of Energy set a limit of 12 years for the Southwest and Mid-Atlantic corridors, subject to revision at any time after giving notice and opportunity for public comment. Project approval Approval of routes for specific projects will continue to be the responsibility of state authorities. However, FERC may issue a permit if a proposed project will significantly reduce a transmission constraint in the national corridor. According to the DOE, NIETC permit process should not disrupt existing activities of state authorities, and will investigate allegations that an applicant has acted in bad faith in state proceedings. When a specific route is chosen for a project, FERC will conduct an environmental impact statement (EIS) prior to groundbreaking. The DOE did not conduct an EIS for either NIETC region, arguing that the designation does not authorize any specific projects or routes. Piedmont Environmental Council v. FERC, 2009 In 2009, the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals considered FERC's interpretation of Section 216 of the FPA as a result of the designations of the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest National Interest Transmission Corridors. Here, the court reversed FERC's interpretation of FPA that reserves the right to overturn a state's denial of a permit application under the FPA's granted authority to assume permitting jurisdiction if a state has \\"withheld approval [of a permit application] for more than 1 year.\\" The court found that the interpretation of the authority to approve denied applications for permits was incorrect and limited FERC's authority to grant approval of applications withheld for more than one year. The result of this decision is that the FERC's power under the FPA with respect to permitting approvals was limited to a specific category of applications. Provided that a state permitting agency clearly denies a permit application within one year of the petition, FERC has no authority to grant those permits. Further, this interpretation was largely reaffirmed by subsequent proposals for energy policy legislation in Congress which excluded clear expansion of FERC's authority over denied permit applications. 2009 National Electric Transmission Congestion Study In 2009, DOE conducted its second transmission congestion study. The data gathering and analysis process differed significantly from the 2006 study in that rather than relying on internal sources of data gathering and analysis, existing research and studies were leveraged from key stakeholders to develop the study. Additionally, in accordance with the Recovery Act of 2009, DOE specifically reviewed those transmission constraints which had, or were projected to have, a negative impact on the development of renewable energy capacity development. As part of this requirement, DOE added two subcategories of Conditional Congestion Areas: Type I - An area with large availability of renewable resources which could be developed using existing technology if sufficient transmission were available; and Type II - An area with renewable resource potential that is not yet technologically mature but shows promise due to its quality, size and location. DOE concluded that both the Mid-Atlantic and Southwestern Critical Congestion Areas had not shown significant positive development and recommended that National Corridors were still valid designations. Additionally, the 2009 report re-affirmed that the San Francisco, Seattle- Portland, and the Phoenix-Tucson Congestion Areas of Concern were still valid classifications. The New England Congestion Area of Concern classification from the 2006 report was rescinded however, as the region had i) shown significant development in utility and small scale capacity, ii) developed aggressive demand response systems which were effective in making timely load reductions, and iii) shown success with energy efficiency programs across the affected area. California Wilderness Coalition v. US Department of Energy, 2011 In 2011, the 2006 Transmission Congestion Study and the 2007 designations of the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors were vacated by the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California Wilderness Coalition v. US DOE. The decision to vacate the 2006 Transmission Congestion Study was made on the basis that DOE did not adequately consult with the states in the conduct of the study as required under the FPA making specific mention that \\"there was the likelihood that proper consultation would have produced different results.\\" The Ninth Circuit Court also vacated the NIETC designations made in 2007 based on DOE's failure to adequately consider the environmental impacts of such designations as required under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). 2012 National Electric Transmission Congestion Study Largely as a result of California Wilderness Coalition v. US DOE, the 2012 National Electric Transmission Study has been delayed. Over the course of 2012, DOE conducted research and hosted three internet based \\"webinars\\" with key transmission stakeholders in the electricity industry do discuss DOE's preliminary findings. Following these webinars, DOE released a preliminary summary of its findings in August, 2012, which are summarized below: * The study will not draw broad conclusions about large geographic areas (i.e. DOE will not identify or update Critical Congestion Areas, Congestion Areas of Concern, or Conditional Congestion Areas); * The study will rely entirely on public data and analyses ‚Äì no DOE modeling; * The study will not analyze the economics of alternative methods to address specific congestion problems; * The economic slow-down that began in 2008 has resulted in a reduced rate of electricity demand growth and concomitantly, less of an increase in transmission congestion; * Low natural gas prices have resulted in lower congestion due to i) increased generation from gas-fired generators which are often located nearer to demand centers, and ii) lower fuel costs translating to lower congestion costs; * State Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) are resulting in increased congestion along specific transmission corridors; * Transmission development since 2009 has helped to reduce congestion; * The North-East region has experienced a decline in congestion costs relative to total electricity costs. * The data collected from the West and Mid-West regions generally aligns with the North-East region. * The DOE identified a strong need for the improvement of transmission data and is working with key stakeholders to define and collect consistent data regarding transmission development, utilization, reliability, and operating practices. The DOE did, however, release a report titled: Transmission Constraints and Congestion in the Western and Eastern Interconnections in January 2014 which examines many of the same topics that the official National Electric Congestion Study will eventually address. In February 2014, the DOE submitted a consultation draft of the 2012 National Electric Transmission Congestion Study to the chairs of the State Public Utility Commissions and the heads of the regional reliability entities, requesting written comments no later than April, 2014.

For example, taking the case of a patient whose headache had been alleviated by taking aspirin, an ex juvantibus line of reasoning would state that the headaches were caused by low levels of aspirin in the brain. Obviously, the fact that aspirin cures headaches does not prove that headaches are caused by the absence of aspirin. In \\"The 21st-Century Brain\\"The 21st Century Brain 2005, Steven Rose, (2006), Steven Rose applies the term to the use of psychoactive drugs to \\"cure\\" depression, implying that the underlying cause of depression is not simply low levels of certain chemicals in the brain (such as serotonin) that these drugs treat. The phrase does not necessarily connote a fallacy. For example, a patient presents with retrosternal pain which is not relieved by sublingual nitrates (a standard remedy for angina pectoris) but is relieved with antacids (a standard remedy for heartburn). In such a case, a physician may hypothesize ex juvantibus what the underlying problem may or may not be, until a definitive diagnosis is established.

Panamaram River Panamaram River is a tributary of the Kabani River along with Mananthavady, Bavali, Noolpuzha and Nugu Rivers. Kabani and its tributaries play a key role in the enhancement of the landscapes of Wayanad District. About 6 km north of Panamaram, the Kabini takes birth. It is the confluence of the Panamaram river, originating in the Western Ghats near Pookode Lake, a perennial lake near Lakkidi, 4,500 ft above sea level, and the Mananthavady river, springing from the 5,000 ft Tondarmudi. The Kabini is, perhaps, the most feminine of Kerala rivers. The flow of life on its banks is incredibly peaceful and dream-like. The confluence of these rivers is Kabani River and it after entering the state of Karnataka merges with the Kaveri River. Panamaram Fort Panamaram has great significance in the history of Indian freedom struggle as it witnessed one of the first freedom struggle in South India. On 11 October 1802 Pazhassi Raja's followers like Thalakkal Chanthu and Edachena Kunkan Nair captured the Panamaram Fort which was manned by the infantry units of Bombay. Commanding officer Capt. Dickinson and Lt. Maxwell were killed in action along with 25 soldiers. And this victory brought a new vigor to the resistance movement. Panamaram Heronry According to the annual heronry count of the Malabar Natural History Society (MNHS), the Panamaram Heronry is the largest heronry in Malabar in terms of number and diversity of birds breeding there. It is a small (1 acre) island in the river Kabani, an elevated sand bank. Government has issued orders to take apt measures to conserve the Panamaram Heronry. The massive destruction of bamboo groves on the heronry and unbridled sand mining are the two vital issues the heronry is facing. It has been observed that, many birds of the foreign origin also migrate to Panamaram during the nestling season. The cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) was also observed breeding here in 2010, the breeding of the bird is reported in the state after 62 years. Other main species are little egret, Ardeola (pond heron), night heron, intermediate egret, purple heron, and black-headed ibis.http://www.surfbirds.com/birdingmail/Mail/KeralaBirder/740662 Transportation Panamaram town comes in the exact middle of Wayanad district.

The region was known as Mayakshetra (Maya's land) in the earliest records. Mayakshetra evolved into Mayanad and finally to Wayanad.

Major characters (currently active)  *John Avery Whittaker, voiced by Hal Smith (1987-1994), Paul Herlinger (1996-2008), and Andre Stojka (since 2009), often known as \\"Whit,\\" is the main fictional character of Adventures in Odyssey and the namesake of Odyssey's most famous attraction, Whit's End. He is viewed as a spiritual Christian leader to the children, and adults also, in Odyssey. He was originally voiced by Hal Smith, but after Smith's death in 1994, the character of Whit left Odyssey to lead an archaeological mission in Israel for the Universal Press Foundation. Whit returned to Odyssey in 1996; he had been voiced by Paul Herlinger until 2008. Andre Stojka took the role following Herlinger's retirement. This is the second character voiced by Stojka that was previously voiced by Hal Smith (the first being Owl from Disney's Winnie the Pooh franchise, with Stojka having voiced the character from 1997 to 2006). *Connie Kendall (since 1987), voiced by Katie Leigh, is probably the second-most major character in Adventures in Odyssey, appearing in more episodes than any other character except John Avery Whittaker. Connie has been voiced by Katie Leigh since her arrival in Odyssey in episode #4: \\"Connie Comes to Town.\\" *Eugene Meltsner (since 1988), voiced by Will Ryan, is a longtime employee at Whit's End. He is very intelligent, having a reputation for erudition and a fondness for trivia. Major plot arcs involving Eugene include his conversion to Christianity and his courtship, engagement, and then marriage to Katrina Shanks. Another major storyline about Eugene is the rediscovery of his father, whom he had believed dead since he was seven years old. *Buck Oliver, voiced by Robby Bruce (since 2011), is a 16-year old who was once involved in a conspiracy to spread counterfeit money across America. He then served time in Juvenile Detention, after which he was released to Eugene and Katrina Meltsner as a foster child. He is a not a Christian. Major story arcs include the counterfeit money conspiracy called the Green ring Conspiracy, and Buck's quest to learn about his family (which were both wrapped up in the episode titled, \\"The Long End\\"). He also seems to have a relationship with Jules. *Katrina Shanks-Meltsner, voiced by Pamela Hayden (1994‚Äì2002) and Audrey Wasilewski (since 2005), is the wife of Eugene Meltsner. She is the daughter of wealthy father Armitage Shanks and mother Millie. She also has two brothers that have never been named. *Jules Kendall, voiced by Shona Rodman (since 2013) who is Connie's younger half-sister. Her name is short for July, since her father Bill has an odd fascination with marrying women with names of the months. She wears thick black eye liner and is annoyed by awkward situations. Jules is not a Christian, and believes that life is just a part of the \\"food chain.\\" She is used to her father's strange situations such as being unknown to her sister. Her first appearance was in \\"Life Expectancy, Part 2.\\" In \\"The Ties That Bind,\\" she was also the Perilous Pen's informant. She also sings with the Westcott girls. *Jason Whittaker (since 1994), voiced by Townsend Coleman, is Whit's son and former National Security Agency agent. He ran Whit's End while Whit was in the Middle East. Jason came very close to marrying his longtime sweetheart, Tasha Forbes, but they broke up while parked in front of the Justice of the Peace's house. Jason currently runs the Triple J's Antiques shop. *Wooton Bassett (since 2001), voiced by Jess Harnell, is an Odyssey mailman who is also the author of several comic series including Power Boy, Captain Absolutely, and Sleuth Family Robinson. In some ways, he seems to have not grown up yet (example: he collects Smiley Meal toys and has a slide going out of his house), although he occasionally shows his mature/serious side. He currently has a strained relationship with his father and his twin brother Wellington because Wooton is a Christian. At the end of Album 58, \\"The Ties That Bind,\\" he proposed to his long-time girlfriend, Penny Wise, and got married in the album \\"Without a Hitch\\". *Chris (since 1987), voiced by Chris Anthony, is the show's announcer from the first episodes until the present time. It was made clear in early episode introductions that she is also a resident of Odyssey. * Penny Bassett (since 2011), voiced by Kimmy Robertson is very cheery. She is easily entertained by the small things in life, though she can become easily distracted. She is a Christian, but she can be swayed by false teachings if she doesn't know better. She is quite eccentric and a fairly abstract thinker, which helps her with one of her principle talents‚Äîart. Penny is also Connie's best friend and used to be her roommate. In the album \\"Without a Hitch,\\" she married Wooton Bassett. * David Parker (since 2010), voiced by Marc Evan Jackson, is the father of the Parker family. He has three kids (Olivia, Matthew, and Camilla), and is married to his Hispanic wife, Eva. His mother- in-law is Lucia, and his sister-in-law is named Rosalita. David is also an architect. * Eva Parker (since 2010), voiced by Amanda Troop, is the wife to David Parker and mother of Olivia, Matthew, and Camilla. She is a sensible mom who works part-time as a nurse at a local clinic. She has to find the right balance between raising her family and dealing graciously with her mother, who wants to make sure their Hispanic heritage doesn‚Äôt get lost. Major characters (currently inactive) =Adults= *Jack Allen (1994‚Äì2012), voiced by Alan Young, is a childhood friend of Whit, former manager of \\"Whit's End\\" when Whit was in the Middle East, and owner of the J & J Antique Gallery, along with his wife Joanne Allen. He last appeared in Album 50 in 2008, and a couple of Darien's Rise episodes in 2009. His final appearance was in Album 56 in 2012, with the announcement that he and Joanne would be traveling to Scotland in their retirement, and handing over management of the antiques shop to Jason Whittaker. Young died in 2016. *Bart Rathbone, (1987-2008) voiced by Walker Edmiston and Robert Easton, is the schemish manager of the Electric Palace. Bart's character often attempts publicity stunts, such as a television game show, and ran as an unfocused, ill-informed candidate for mayor, against Tom Riley and later Margaret Faye. Both Edmiston and Easton have since died. *Bernard Walton (1990‚Äì2008), voiced by Dave Madden is Odyssey's window-washer. Though kind-hearted, Bernard is somewhat cynical and grumpy, but is most widely known for his metaphorical humor and penchant for storytelling. He hosts B-TV, a Christian television show in Odyssey. He is also Eugene's distant relative. The character was retired from the show upon the retirement of Dave Madden, who has since died. *Tom Riley (1987‚Äì2008), voiced by Walker Edmiston, is a local farmer and good friend of Whit. Edmiston died shortly before the recording of album 50, so Tom's character has recently been retired as well. Tom is said to be a longtime conservative member and chairman of the Odyssey City Council, as well as a one-term mayor of the town. An episode Album 62 in 2017 revealed that Riley had been dead \\"for years\\". * George Barclay (1988‚Äì1997, 2003‚Äì2004), voiced by Chuck Bolte, A family man, George eventually left Odyssey with his wife and kids for Pokenberry Falls to become pastor at local church (which served as the basis for a spoof of the film It's a Wonderful Life in album 31). He returned for several episodes in 2003 and 2004 to perform Connie and Mitch's wedding, which ultimately never happened. He also came by town for the unreleased 2009 episode/live event \\"BTV Live: God's Calling.\\" (Barclay's name shares a pronunciation with that of Bishop George Berkeley, the 18th century philosopher after whom the University of California, Berkeley is named.) Each member of the Barclay family was named after characters and actors from It's a Wonderful Life. * Mary Barclay (1989‚Äì1997), voiced by Patricia Parris and Carol Bilger. Mary is the wife of Pastor George Barclay and mother of three children, Donna, Jimmy, and Stewart Barclay. * Dr. Regis Blackgaard (1989, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1999, 2000), voiced by Earl Boen is Whit's nemesis. Dr. Blackgaard was supposedly killed in an explosion of his own making in 1995. However, he left behind a virus in the Imagination Station that was destroyed a few years later after attempting to gain a corporeal form from Aubrey Shepard. Some of Dr. Blackgaard's biggest fans refuse to admit he was killed in the explosion, saying he's still alive but biding his time before returning to Odyssey again, if he ever does. * Robert \\"Mitch\\" Mitchell (2001‚Äì2003, 2012), voiced by Steve Burns is Connie's boyfriend and an FBI agent also known as AREM (phonetical spelling of RM, his initials). Mitch's relationship with Connie was a turbulent one, plagued by misunderstandings and Connie's reluctance to trust him because of the secrecy of his work. Mitch was placed in witness protection during the Novacom Saga and was presumed dead until Connie discovered the truth. After the Novacom Saga, he proposed to Connie, but the two decided to call off the wedding at the last minute and temporarily separate. He briefly returned to Odyssey in album 55 in an FBI investigation, with his partner Maureen, who was his new fianc√©. * Dale Jacobs (1989‚Äì1998, 2012‚Äì2014), voiced by Phil Lollar, is the editor of The Odyssey Times. He had two daughters, Robyn and Melanie; Robyn (1989‚Äì92) was one of the more popular kid characters during her time on the show. * Richard Maxwell (1989‚Äì2000), voiced by Nathan Carlson, debuted in the episode \\"An Encounter with Mrs. Hooper\\", and returned as a manipulative bully who worked as a counselor at Campbell County Community College and victimized his young charge, Nicholas Adamsworth in the episode \\"Eugene's Dilemma\\". After the truth about Richard's actions was revealed and he was dismissed from the college, Richard entered the employment of Dr. Regis Blackgaard, but had a change of heart after one of Blackgaard's schemes landed Lucy Cunningham- Schultz in the hospital. Having burned down Tom Riley's barn (for which Tom refused to forgive him for years afterward) and hacked into John Avery Whittaker's computer on Blackgaard's orders, Richard served two years in the Campbell County Detention Center before being released on parole. He foiled a number of Blackgaard's plans as part of his quest for personal redemption. * Peter Bourland (2002‚Äì2003), voiced by Keith Silverstein, was an FBI Agent who helped investigate the Novacom case. * Arthur Dent (2000‚Äì2002), named after the character from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and voiced by Christopher Snell, was an employee of Andromeda. Arthur Dent was driven to temporary paranoia by the realization of the corporation's goals and apparent power. He later destroyed a radio tower with fertilizer explosives, thinking that it was the tower from which Andromeda would be broadcasting its mind- control signals. After a court trial, he did not make any further appearances in Odyssey. * Armitage Shanks, voiced by Bernard Erhard (1995‚Äì1998) and Brian Cummings (2002), was the father of Katrina Shanks; now deceased (allegedly murdered by poisoning during the Novacom Saga). He was a bit overprotective of his daughter, and was frequently at odds with Eugene during the early stages of Eugene and Katrina's relationship; however, he was motivated more by love of his daughter than by malice toward Eugene. =Children= * Rodney Rathbone (1989‚Äì2007), voiced by Steve Burns, the son of Bart Rathbone, is a mischievous local bully and head of The Bones of Rath, a gang of teenagers who cause mischief. Since the character of Bart was retired with the death of Walker Edmiston, Rodney is no longer a resident of Odyssey as well. * Aubrey Shepard, voiced by Camilla Belle (1998-1999) and Danielle Judovits (1999-2005), was a creative and introspective girl who loves books and poetry. She has a tendency to act impetuously, which often gets her into trouble. Aubrey lived in Tom Riley's Timothy Center with her father Ben, mother Ellen, and younger sister Bethany. She was initially unhappy about her parents' newfound Christianity and often made a point to rebel against it, but became a Christian herself during the Novacom Saga. She later left for college. * Sam Johnson (1991‚Äì1996), voiced by Kyle Ellison, was a good-hearted boy who also tended to be somewhat naive. * Lawrence Hodges (1992‚Äì1995, 2008), voiced by Gabriel Encarnacion, is a hyper-active kid with a run-away imagination to the point where he was having trouble separating his make-believe world and the real world, He was briefly heard over a phone-interview in the two part 2008 episode \\"The Triangled Web\\" (He is working at a laundromat as he has been kicked out of NASA.) * Lucy Cunningham-Schultz (1988‚Äì1996, 2008), voiced by Genni Long, was a pre-teen reporter for both her middle school's newspaper The Odyssey Owl and The Odyssey Times. She reappeared as a college student in \\"The Triangled Web\\" and married Jack Davis. * Donna Barclay (1988‚Äì1997), voiced by Azure Janosky. Daughter of George and Mary, older sister of Jimmy; often portrayed as a typical teenage girl who liked boys and shopping. Donna had a rebellious streak and could be somewhat temperamental also, but had a good heart and moral compass. Her best friend was Dale Jacobs' elder daughter, Robyn Jacobs (voiced by Sage Bolte, 1989-1992), who was herself the central character in many episodes. * James (Jimmy) Barclay (1988‚Äì1996, 2004, 2008), voiced by David Griffin. Probably the most popular child character in the show's history. He and his family were in numerous episodes. He was the only child star kept after the death of the 1st Whit and was kept after his voice changed (it was common practice for AIO to drop actors when their voice changed). He has the second most appearances for a child character, behind Lucy. Jimmy lived in Washington, D.C. for a while, working as a reporter for a tabloid, but eventually admitted to his dad that he wasn't in the best of places and returned to Pokenberry Falls. Returned for \\"The Triangled Web\\". * Grady McKay (2004‚Äì2008), voiced by Jordan Orr, is a friend of Wooton. * Tamika Washington (2003‚Äì2008), voiced by Courtney Brown, is the daughter of Ed and Elaine. * Digger Digwillow (1988), voiced by Chad Reisser, was the first person to experience the Imagination Station, and the founder of \\"Wonderworld.\\" Oddly enough, he was only in three episodes (The Imagination Station I & II, Heatwave). * Isaac Morton, (1989‚Äì1993) voiced by Justin Morgan, is a friend of Lucy, although before Curt. He was a good-hearted but cowardly kid who had a lot of run-ins with a bully named Rodney Rathbone, leader of the \\"Bones of Rath\\" gang. * Jack Davis, (1988‚Äì1989, 1992‚Äì1994, 2008) voiced by Donald Long, is another of Lucy's acquaintances. Most known for the being the \\"coolest\\" kid. He later became engaged with Lucy in \\"The Triangled Web\\". * Curt Stevens, (1990‚Äì1992, 2008) voiced by Fabio Stephens, had a relationship with Lucy and was always getting into trouble. He also returned for \\"The Triangled Web\\". * Jenny Roberts, Voiced by Natalie Babbitt, was the show's second of two blind characters. Despite her disability, she never let it get her down and fit in quite easily in Odyssey. In the three-episode The Perfect Witness, she was kidnapped from Holstein's Bookstore and made use of her heightened senses of smell and hearing to help catch the criminals. She was also the longtime pen-pal to Melanie Jacobs, as seen in the Episode \\"Pen Pal.\\" * Liz Horton, (1998‚Äì2007) voiced by Lauren Schaffel, was the reporter for Odyssey Owl and best friend of Mandy Straussberg. Also, it was revealed that she has a crush on Alex Jefferson in \\"Slumber Party\\". * Jared DeWhite (1997‚Äì1999, 2001‚Äì2004, 2008), Voiced by Brandon Gilberstadt, was a trouble maker and conspiracy theorist who moved away after a few seasons. He returned during the Novacom saga (he and his family had been placed in Witness Protection) and tipped off Sarah and Mandy to the activities of Novacom. * Dwayne Oswald, (1997‚Äì1999) voiced by Kris Kachurak, is best known as a foil for Jared DeWhite, Dwayne began as a character who was no good at anything and turned into an honor student later on. * Alex Jefferson, (1999‚Äì2003) voiced by Travis Tedford, played a pivotal role in the Novacom saga with his cousin Cal. * Marvin Washington, voiced by Kyle Massey (2003), Jordan Colloway (2003‚Äì2004), and Kendr√© Berry (2004‚Äì2008, 2017) was a child character and an African American; lives with his parents Ed and Elaine and his sister Tamika. While the Washington family were not the first African-American characters on Adventures in Odyssey, they are arguably the first to be considered \\"major\\" characters. * Nick Mulligan (1997‚Äì2005), voiced by Christopher Castile, (the nephew and adopted son of Mike and Tracy Mulligan) was portrayed early on as a brash, tough-talking street kid from New York City who smoked and frequently clashed with his cousin/adopted sister Lisa, but eventually he quit smoking and became an employee at Whit's End, and his character mellowed slightly. * Mandy Straussberg (1998‚Äì2008), voiced by Aria Curzon, is very gifted in writing stories and plays, and in the episode \\"The Present Long Ago\\", it is revealed that she will one day marry the middle school's other top student, Trent DeWhite. * Rusty Gordon (1993‚Äì1995), Voiced by Shawn Svoboda, is a member of Rodney's gang, the Bones of Rath. He later wrote a book that painted a very negative portrait of Odyssey, which inspired Connie to write her own book. In \\"The Ties That Bind,\\" he is revealed to have criminal connections. * Trent DeWhite (2003‚Äì2008), voiced by Corey Padnos, is Jared's little brother. Possessing a toned-down version of his brother's vivid imagination, Trent has been known to overreact and daydream at times. He is a top student at Odyssey Middle School, and at one point developed a crush on Mandy Straussberg, who he will one day marry as revealed in \\"The Present Long Ago\\". * Shannon Everett (1992‚Äì1994), is a rich and popular cheerleader who often resorted to bullying tactics and/or deception to get her way. Minor characters * Officer Patrick O'Ryan, voiced by Will Ryan, is a slightly goofy Irish-accented Odyssey police officer who replaced Officer David Harley because Harley was perceived as a disrespectful portrayal of police officers for children. He originally appeared on June 16, 1990, in the episode \\"An Act of Mercy,\\" which was a remake of the Harley episode \\"The Quality of Mercy.\\" * Edwin Blackgaard (1992‚Äì2008), voiced by Earl Boen, is the twin brother of Dr. Regis Blackgaard and owner of the Harlequin Dinner Theatre. Despite being a little full of himself, he means well and wishes to bring culture to Odyssey. * Walter Shakespeare (1992‚Äì2008), voiced by Corey Burton, is the assistant to Edwin at the Harlequin Dinner Theatre. * Doris Rathbone (1993‚Äì1998), voiced by Pamela Hayden and Diane Hsu (2007‚Äìpresent), is Rodney's mother. * Harlow Doyle (1992‚Äì2000, 2005, 2008, 2010), voiced by Will Ryan.

Jason almost married her before deciding against it because she wasn't a Christian. * Joe Finneman (1991‚Äì1994), voiced by Parley Baer, was Connie's great uncle, owner of \\"Finneman's Market\\". * June Kendall (1988‚Äì1996, 2002‚Äì2003), voiced by Maggie Malooly, is the mother of Connie. She eventually became a Christian, unlike her ex-husband Bill Kendall, and died in album 57. * Agnes Riley, voiced by Julia Kazarian (1988) and Susan Silo (1996, 2002‚Äì2005) is Tom Riley's wife, also known to her close friends as \\"Rose\\" (her middle name). Agnes, an artistic woman who enjoys painting and music, suffers from dementia and resides in an assisted-living facility. She was so infrequently seen by Odyssey residents that the first time Rodney Rathbone saw Tom talking to her (and being unaware that they were married), he assumed Tom was having an illicit affair with her. * Margaret Faye (1997‚Äì1998, 2006, 2008), voiced by Alexandra Kenworthy, ran for Odyssey Mayor against Bart Rathbone and won. She had feelings for Mr. Whittaker and asked him to marry her as well as manage her campaign, but Whit, not agreeing with many of the issues she supported, declined, which infuriated her. Connie later worked on her campaign. * Phillip Glossman (1988‚Äì1990, 1992, 1994‚Äì1995, 2008), voiced by Paul McCusker, is a state Congressman who harbors a personal vendetta against John Avery Whittaker dating back to the founding of Whit's End. * Leonard Meltsner (2006‚Äì2007), voiced by Phil Proctor is the father of Eugene. He returned to America for a while and then returned to Africa to minister to the local natives with Eugene's brother Everett.

(\\"Mistaken for Good\\") She dislikes Wooton with a passion.

His maternal grandfather was Solomon Townsend, a prominent merchant in Albany, and his siblings were Henry Townsend Martin (d. 1915), Bradley Martin (1841‚Äì1913), who married Cornelia Sherman, Howard Townsend Martin, and Alice Townsend. His niece, Bradley's daughter, Cornelia Martin (1877-1961), married William Craven, 4th Earl of Craven (1868‚Äì1921).

The game was documented as Terh√ºch√º by John Henry Hutton in The Angami Nagas, With Some Notes on Neighboring Tribes (1921). According to Hutton, Terh√ºch√º means \\"Fighting-eating\\" because the two opposing pieces are fighting and eating each other. There are a few variations of the game under the term Terh√ºch√º, and all of them are similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them; they are most similar to Alquerque as a standard Alquerque board is used instead of a checkered square board, and in one variant eight triangular board sections are attached to the four sides (specifically to the middle vertex of each side) and the four corner vertices of the Alquerque board. Each triangular board section is a triangle that is cross-sliced yielding an additional 48 intersections or vertices (or \\"points\\") to the 25 points of the standard Alquerque board which yields a total of 73 points on the board. Each triangle is adjoined to the Alquerque board at one of its three vertices. Each triangle is cross-sliced in such a way that a line segment is drawn from the adjoining vertex to the base of the triangle with the other line segment drawn across the breadth of the triangle. As in Alquerque, pieces can move and capture in any available direction at any time during the game following the pattern of the board. Hutton describes three variants that are termed Terh√ºch√º. The first two use a standard Alquerque board only. The first variant has each player having 10 pieces (this is in contrast with standard Alquerque which has 12 pieces for each player) with each player's pieces distinguishable from the other player. At the beginning of the game, the 10 pieces are placed on the first two ranks of each player's side of the board thus occupying all 10 points of the first two ranks. The second variant has each player having 8 pieces, and they also occupy the first two ranks of each player's side of the board, but on the second rank the two outermost points are left empty. For the third variant (with the eight additional triangular board sections attached to a standard Alquerque board) each player has 9 pieces; the first rank of the Alquerque board has 5 pieces and the second rank has 3 pieces leaving the two outermost points empty (as in the second variant previously described), and the remaining piece is placed inside one of the triangular board sections nearest the player diagonally adjacent to the left of the adjoining vertex. All variations termed Terh√ºch√º follow the following rules with exceptions noted for the variant with the additional eight triangular boards.  Rules  * Players alternate their turns. * A player may only use one of their pieces in a turn, and must either make a move or perform a capture but not both. * A piece may be moved to a vacant adjacent point along a line.The piece may also move in any direction provided it is available unlike in most variants of draughts where pieces are initially restricted to the forward direction * A piece may capture an opposing piece by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The piece must be adjacent to the opposing piece, and leap over it onto a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. The captured piece is removed from the board.It is unknown if the same piece can continue to capture within the same turn since Hutton does not mention it. Nor does he mention about captures being obligatory. * The player who captures all of the other player's pieces wins. * This rule only applies to the variant of Terh√ºch√º with eight additional triangular boards. Hutton writes \\"Inside these corners the piece may skip one junction of lines and move straight to the next but one.\\" The rule is a bit vague especially the portion \\"...but one\\". But the rule may mean that a piece may move two points in a turn thus skipping the point (\\"one junction\\" as Hutton writes it) inbetween; Hutton does not mention if such a move can be performed if there is a friendly or opposing piece on the point to be skipped over. This type of move must be completed completely within the triangular board it seems.  Variants  Terh√ºch√º is related to Sixteen Soldiers, Peralikatuma, and Kotu Ellima which are also from the Indian subcontinent. Another Naga people called the Sumi Naga have a very similar game that was documented as the War Game by John Henry Hutton (the same person who documented Terh√ºch√º) in The Sema Nagas (1921).. The Sumi Naga are also from the state of Nagaland of Northeast India. The Sumi were referred to as Sema in the past. Hutton provides no indigenous name for the game, or an explanation for the lack of one. The game is very similar to Terh√ºch√º (especially the first two variants described above) and Alquerque with only one obvious difference. It uses a standard Alquerque board, but with each player only having 11 pieces. In the beginning of the game, the pieces are placed similarly to that of Alquerque except only one piece from each player occupies the middle row (also known as the common third rank of each player) and they are placed on the outermost points leaving three vacant points at the beginning of the game.

Description CMS is a general framework for electronic signatures for various kinds of transactions like purchase requisition, contracts or invoices. CAdES specifies precise profiles of CMS signed data making it compliant with the European eIDAS regulation (Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market). The eIDAS regulation enhances and repeals the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC. EIDAS is legally binding in all EU member states since July 2014. An electronic signature that has been created in compliance with eIDAS has the same legal value as a handwritten signature. An electronic signature, technically implemented based on CAdES has the status of an advanced electronic signature. This means that * it is uniquely linked to the signatory; * it is capable of identifying the signatory; * only the signatory has control of the data used for the signature creation; * it can be identified if data attached to the signature has been changed after signing. A resulting property of CAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny the validity of the signature. A CAdES-based electronic signature is accepted in a court proceeding as evidence; as advanced electronic signatures are legally binding. But it gets higher probative value when enhanced to a qualified electronic signature. To receive that legal standing, it needs to be doted with a digital certificate, encrypted by a security signature creation device (\\"qualified electronic signature\\"). The authorship of a statement with a qualified electronic signature cannot be challenged - the statement is non- repudiable. The document ETSI TS 101 733 Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) ‚Äì CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES) describes the framework. Evolution of the framework The main document describing the format is ETSI TS 101 733 Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) ‚Äì CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES). The ETSI TS 101 733 was first issued as V1.2.2 (2000‚Äì12). The current release version has the release number V2.2.1 (2013-04). ETSI is working on a new draft of CAdES. All drafts and released documents are publicly accessible at . The ETSI TS V.1.7.4 (2008-07) is technically equivalent to RFC 5126. RFC 5126 document builds on existing standards that are widely adopted. These include: * RFC 3852 : \\"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\\" * ISO/IEC 9594-8/ITU-T Recommendation X.509 \\"Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Authentication framework\\" * RFC 3280 \\"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\\" * RFC 3161 \\"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)\\". Profiles  ETSI \\"TS 101 733\\" specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on CMS (CAdES). It defines a number of signed and unsigned optional signature properties, resulting in support for a number of variations in the signature contents and processing requirements. In order to maximize interoperability in communities applying CAdES to particular environments it was necessary to identify a common set of options that are appropriate to that environment. Such a selection is commonly called a profile. ETSI \\"TS 103 173\\" describes profiles for CAdES signatures, in particular their use in the context of the EU Services Directive, \\"Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market\\". There are four profiles available: *CAdES-B: Basic Electronic Signature, the simplest version, containing the SignedInfo, SignatureValue, KeyInfo and SignedProperties. This level combines the old -BES and -EPES levels. This form extends the definition of an electronic signature to conform to the identified signature policy *CAdES-T: B-Level for which a Trust Service Provider has generated a trusted token (time-mark or time-stamp token) proving that the signature itself actually existed at a certain date and time. *CAdES-LT: are built by direct incorporation to CAdES-T signatures conformant to the T-Level, a long-term-validation attribute containing values of certificates and values of certificate revocation status used to validate the signature. *CAdES-LTA: a signature conformant to LT-Level to which one or more long-term-validation attribute with a poeValue has been incorporated. By using periodical timestamping (e.g. each year) it is prevented the compromising of the signature due to weakening algorithms during long time storage periods. This level is equivalent to the old -A level See also * European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) * Cryptographic Message Syntax * XAdES, XML Advanced Electronic Signature * PAdES, PDF Advanced Electronic Signature * ASiC, Associated Signature Containers (ASiC) * Trusted timestamping References External links *RFC 5126 CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures (CAdES) *RFC 3126 Electronic Signature Formats for long term electronic signatures *All versions of ETSI TS 101 733 CAdES *SecureBlackbox : Cross-platform library for creating and manipulating CAdES, XAdES, PAdES and ASiC Signatures *XolidoSign desktop (Free.

Bassist Bruce Moreland had departed the group again by this stage, and in order for Charles Gray to play bass in addition to his normal keyboard duties, the group took on guest keyboardist Roger Mason from popular Australian band The Models. Two of the album's tracks, \\"Living in the Red\\" and \\"The Heart Never Can Tell\\", were recorded at Big Joe's Bar 'n' Grill in Bullhead City, Arizona. The CD issue included another two tracks from Bullhead, \\"The Grass is Greener\\" and an idiosyncratic cover of Woody Guthrie's \\"Pretty Boy Floyd.\\" It was dedicated to renowned German producer Conny Plank, who had died in December 1987, and who never recorded with Wall of Voodoo, but whose productions for such German progressive/experimental bands as Kraftwerk, Neu!, Cluster, Harmonia and Guru Guru were an influence on the group's music. The album title makes reference to the bestselling 1958 expose The Ugly American by Eugene Burdick and William J. Lederer.

Early life Johann was born into a Bernese noble family of the Ancien R√©gime of Switzerland. He was the son of Baron Johann Rudolf de Steiger and Elizabeth von Tavel, and born in Karlruhe, Germany in 1778. His father was a Lt. Colonel, and bailiff of Grandson, Switzerland, who resided for some time at Grandson Castle. Johann himself would be a captain of the guards for Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden,Family History, ¬∂ 15-18 as well as a business owner. =French invasion= In 1798, the French under Napoleon would invade Switzerland. The Swiss aristocracy was indecisive in dealing with this threat, but Johann's cousin, Niklaus Friedrich von Steiger was not. He was the most prominent political figure in Switzerland at the time, and leader of the political party and Bernese senate which supported the resistance against Napoleon and the French.EncyclopediaThe History of the Invasion, p. 115 Niklaus would participate in the battle of Grauholz in 1798 in an attempt to push back the French invasion.Historic Studies, p. 809 The Swiss aristocracy would be overthrown by Napoleon, however, and much of the de Steiger fortune usurped to pay for Napoleon's expeditions into Egypt. In 1803, the Austrians and Russians would invade Switzerland, which led to the Act of Mediation. =Marriages= Johann would marry a German woman named Wilhelmina Muller, in which they would have three children, John, Elizabeth, and Wilhelmina. The couple would divorce. Johann, who would own a flour mill, fell in love with an employee's daughter, Magdalena Stalder. However, Bernese law prevented the intermarriage of Swiss nobility and lower classes. He would leave Bern, Switzerland to immigrate to the United States with dreams of creating a Swiss colony, and to marry Magdalena.Family History, ¬∂ 19, 20 Immigration to America In 1819, Johann sold his family's possessions, including his business, gathered his children, Magdalena, and some Swiss colonists, and began a journey to America. They traveled to Amsterdam, where he married Magdalena, to board a ship for America. They arrived in America, journeyed to Philadelphia, then to Pittsburgh, and boarded a boat down the Ohio river.Family History, ¬∂ 20-25 They would disembark in southern Ohio, where Johann then purchased along the Federal creek in Athens, Ohio, for his family and fellow colonists. Ohio by this time was already a state of the United States, and the dreams of a Swiss colony were not realistic. The colonists were an urban group, and had troubles in the American frontier, but nonetheless survived. Johann would build a cabin initially for his family, and eventually a Swiss-style cottage, which still stands as an historical landmark in Athens. He would die in 1834, and is buried in Boaz, Wood County, West Virginia. A descendant of Johann's was Louis R. de Steiguer, who was the grandson of John.Athens County History, p. 412, 163Family History, ¬∂ EpilogueFamily History, Genealogy Baron Johann Rudolf de Steiguer grave.

Original premises In 1998, Sasha Regan took the initiative to convert a disused paper warehouse on Union Street near Southwark station into a functioning theatre. Set beneath railway arches, it was one of the more distinctive theatrical spaces in London. When its landlord, the publicly owned infrastructure body Network Rail, wished to redevelop the site for offices, a campaign was started to save the theatre, and also other small businesses nearby which were given just 12 weeks notice to relocate. The Union Theatre was given a stay of execution. Relocation In 2016, after almost twenty years in its original premises, the Union Theatre moved into new Network Rail premises just across the road from its original site.Union Theatre website. Accessed 14 August 2016 The theatre's new home, which \\"will keep the heart of the Union intact,\\" offers a restaurant, rehearsal room, and some offices to let. Enhanced facilities include tiered seats and an increased seating capacity. Production history The Union has a reputation for staging musicals in its tiny studio space. Some of its productions include Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd and Assassins, Adler and Ross' The Pajama Game, Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado (an all-male version) and HMS Pinafore.

She was renamed Noyo in 1935 and in 1940 was sold to Thailand, being renamed Nang Suang Nawa, being seized in 1942 and renamed Empire Adur. She was sold to Thailand in 1948, reverting to Nang Suang Nawa and was lost at sea in 1955 while being towed to Hong Kong for scrapping. History Griffdu was built by J F Duthie & Co, Seattle, Washington. She was the 37th and last ship built by Duthie. Griffdu was launched on 20 September 1920, and completed the following month. Her original owner was the Universal Steamship & Barge Co, Seattle. In 1925, Griffdu was sold to The Charles Nelson Co, San Francisco, serving with them for ten years. In 1935, Griffdu was sold to the Union Lumber Co, San Francisco, who renamed her Noyo. She served for five years before being sold to the Thai Niyom Panich Co, (Thai Navigation Co Ltd) Bangkok, who reflagged her and renamed her Nang Suang Nawa. In 1942, Nang Suang Nawa was seized, and passed to the Ministry of War Transport and renamed Empire Adur. She was placed under the management of the Singapore Straits Steamship Company. Empire Adur was not a popular member of convoys due to the condition of her boilers, and the fact that she would belch black smoke and flames from her funnel. The convoy escorts threatened to ask Empire Adur to leave the convoy or sink her. Another of her faults was that the nut holding the steering wheel on often came loose, with the result that the wheel came off in the helmsman's hands. Empire Adur joined Convoy KMS 21 at Gibraltar on 29 July 1943, arriving at Port Said on 9 August. Empire Adur had a final destination of Tripoli and Alexandria. In 1948, Empire Adur was sold to the Thai Maritime Navigation Co, Bangkok and regained her former name of Nang Suang Nawa. She served for a further seven years but went missing under tow by the Philippines registered tug Albacore to Hong Kong for scrapping. Both vessels were presumed lost. Her last reported position was north of the Paracel Islands at on 23 November 1955. Official number and code letters Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers. Griffdu and Noyo had the US Official Number 220755. Nang Suang Nawa and Empire Adur had the UK Official number 166215. Griffdu and Noyo used the Code Letters KJLP.

The overall design of the ensign is a modification of the national flag, with the ratio of the width to the length extended to 1:2. The ensign was created by law in 1966. The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port. History In 1966, a year after Singapore's independence from Malaysia, a document entitled Singapore Merchant Marine Ensign and numbered Misc. 5 of 1966, was laid before Parliament on 6 September 1966 by the Deputy Prime Minister. The document created a civil ensign that was to be used on ships registered in Singapore. The Red Ensign has been in use since then.Misc. 5 of 1966 is on file at the National University of Singapore Central Library under the call number V305.12Ssm 1966: see . Design According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the background of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three.. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than to the left of the stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag.. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032. =Construction sheet= The MPA's 1999 circular includes a construction sheet with detailed dimensions for the manufacture of the flag. The sheet is in inches and centimetres. The overall dimensions of the flag are by . The space between the top of the ensign to the top of the ring, and the bottom of the ring to the bottom of the ensign, is . The outer diameter of the ring is , and the ring itself is in thickness. The outer curve of the crescent has a radius of . Each star fits within a circle with a diameter of , and the centres of the five stars are positioned 72¬∞ from each other along the circumference of an imaginary circle with a radius of . The centre of the imaginary circle is from the lowest point of the inner curve of the crescent. . Regulations Members of a boat's crew standing in front of a Red Ensign Section 36(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 empowers the relevant Minister to prescribe an ensign for Singaporean ships, which shall then be the \\"proper colours for a Singapore ship.\\". Section 36(2) goes on to state that the master of a ship, the ship's owner if he is on board, and any other person hoisting colours may be fined up to S$1,000 if, instead of the Red Ensign, any other \\"distinctive national colours\\" are hoisted on board any Singapore ship without the Minister's consent. Under section 37 of the Act, if a Singapore ship fails to hoist the Red Ensign on entering or leaving any port, the ship master may be fined up to $1,000. The MPA's 1999 circular calls the attention of owners, masters and officers of Singapore ships to sections 36 and 37 of the Merchant Shipping Act.

The church is notable for polychrome decorations that partially decorate the ground floor of the exterior, similar to that see in the church San Giovanni Fuorcivitas. History Jesus Giving the Keys to St Peter above entrance portal A church here was putatively erected circa 798 by a Lombard patron, by the name of either Ratperto di Guinichisio or Retnato di Guillichisio. It came to be under the ownership of an order of Benedictine nuns, and later Franciscans. In underwent a few expansions and refurbishment, a major restoration in 1263, from when the Romanesque exterior derives. The central portal's architrave is attributed to the workshop of Guido da Como, and depicts a \\"Jesus Giving the Keys to St Peter, with the Virgin and the Apostles\\". The fa√ßade has maintained the original Romanesque appearance, and, like the nearby church of San Bartolomeo in Pantano, is divided into five compartments with bichrome decoration. In 1640, under Jesuit ownership, the interior was largely restored and enriched with Baroque-style decorations.Guida di Pistoia per'gli amanti delle Belle Arti, by Francesco Tolomei, Pistoia (1821): pages 59-61. Today the church is deconsecrated, the interior artwork has been moved, and the former convent now houses a State Institute of Arts, the Liceo Artistico Petrocchi. In the matronaeum are exhibited work by the Pistoiese sculptor Andrea Lippi. Of historical interest is that a newly appointed bishop to Pistoia, arriving to town via Porta Lucchese, in a ceremony in this church, would have a mystical marriage to the abbess of the Benedictine convent, and then move to the Cathedral to take his post.F.

It was started on 23 October 1923 by one of the most militant sections of the Hamburg district Communist Party (KPD), the KP Wasserkante. Rebels stormed 24 police stations, 17 in Hamburg and seven in Schleswig-Holstein Province in Prussia. From a military point of view, the attempt was futile and over within three days. Without support from the rest of Germany and the Soviet Union, the communist insurgency disintegrated. Some 100 people died during the uprising. The exact details of the rebellion, as well as the assessment of its impact, are controversial to this day.  Background  Between 1919 and 1923, the Weimar Republic was in crisis and there were many violent conflicts between left- and right-wing elements. The economic situation of the population was rapidly deteriorating and by autumn 1923 hyperinflation was at its peak, which brought gains in popularity to the Communist Party. The Occupation of the Ruhr region further radicalized the political disputes. In August 1923, there was a wave of nationwide strikes against Reichskanzler Wilhelm Cuno. At the end of September, the government declared a state of emergency. On 1 October, the Black Reichswehr attempted the K√ºstrin Putsch. Two weeks later, on 13 October, the Reichstag adopted an enabling act that was to facilitate a de jure dictatorship by Chancellor Gustav Stresemann. A demonstration of several thousand unemployed stormed the \\"forbidden zone\\" around the city hall, an action which, during this period, risked death at the hands of the police and right-wing paramilitaries. In Saxony and Thuringia, coalition governments were formed that included the KPD, which saw this as an opportunity to take over. Within the international Communist movement, there was discussion of an attempted armed rebellion in Germany. Leon Trotsky and other influential members of the Soviet Politburo and the Comintern advanced the idea, but Heinrich Brandler, head of the KPD, felt it was premature. The exact motives of the small Hamburg group led by Hugo Urbahns and Hans Kippenberger, who planned the uprising, remain unknown.  Uprising  Late on 22 October 1923, the military leader of the KP Wasserkante received orders via the regional party leadership to begin the rebellion. Only 1,300 took an active part in the rebellion from the beginning, although the Hamburg KPD numbered some 14,000 members. No more than 5,000 workers had participated by the end of it. On 23 October at 5:00 a.m., they stormed 26 police precincts and took weapons from 17 of them.Stadtteilkollektiv Rotes Winterhude (2003), p. 11 There was also activity in Altona and the urban district of Stormarn, where the police stations in Schiffbek\\"Schiffbek im Hamburger Aufstand\\" Geschichtswerkstatt Billstedt and Bramfeld were attacked and weapons taken. In Bad Oldesloe, Ahrensburg and Rahlstedt, train tracks and streets were blockaded. In the town of Bargteheide, insurgents arrested local government leaders and proclaimed the \\"Soviet Republic of Stormarn\\". In Schiffbek, where the KPD had support, placards were posted to calm residents and to urge support for the uprising, declaring \\"Long live Soviet Germany! Long live the Federation of Soviet states of the world! Long live the world revolution!\\" Most of the uprising was quelled in a few hours. In Schiffbek, it lasted till just past noon. Only in Barmbek, where the KPD had received some 20% of the vote in the previous election, the insurgents were supported by residents, who helped them build barricades and brought them food. The rebels were able to maintain their position during the entire day, despite the continuous exchange of gunfire. At night, however, convinced of the hopelessness of their situation, they snuck away. The next day, the police launched a major offensive against empty barricades.  Aftermath  The Uprising claimed the lives of 17 police officers, 21 rebels and 61 innocent bystanders. Sixty-nine police officers were wounded, along with 175 rebels. There were 1,400 people arrested, with 443 tried in a special court. In Schiffbek alone, 191 people were arrested and later, in February 1925, had to be tried at the Altona Landgericht because of unrest in Schiffbeck, where the KPD had garnered 32.4% of the vote in the May 1924 election. This was the largest of the trials against the Uprising insurgents. (Hamburg wharf worker), 1928 painting by Heinrich Vogeler The Uprising contributed to the deteriorating relationship between the two working class political parties. After the Uprising, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) refused to work with the KPD and even intensified the repression of the KPD by reinforcing the government's positions. Rejection by both the Republic and the SPD strengthened the Communists. Within the KPD, the Uprising became a heroic legendErich Wollenberg, \\"Der Hamburger Aufstand und die Th√§lmann- Legende\\" (1964) (PDF) Papiertiger‚ÄìKollektiv.

The defeat of the Uprising was interpreted as the consequence of too little centralization and too little obedience to party-oriented structures and evidence that these must be increased. Sections of the middle class saw in the Uprising their fears of a Bolshevik Revolution confirmed and became more attracted to anti-communist politics. As a result, in the 1924 Hamburg Reichstag election, the German National People's Party saw their share of the votes rise from 12% to about 20%, though it quickly dropped back to around 12% in 1928.Hamburg election results Die Freie und Hansestadt Hamburg Reichstagswahlen 1919‚Äì1933.

The sculpted architrave of the portal. San Bartolomeo in Pantano is a Romanesque and Gothic style, Roman Catholic church in Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy, dedicated to St. Bartholomew the Apostle. The pantano of the name refers to the once marshy area in which the building was located. History The church and the adjacent Benedictine abbey were founded during the Lombard domination of Italy, between 726 and 767, by the Lombard physician Gaiduald or Guidoaldo. The Benedictines were established under the protection of the Marquises of Tuscany. In 1001, the Marquis Ugo the Great died in the abbey.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni : guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Pistoia (1853): page 190. The complex was first restored in the 12th century by Abbot Buono. In 1433 the Benedictines, whose numbers had dwindled, were replaced by Canons Regular of the Lateran, which were related to the Augustinian canons. These were derived from the monastery associated with San Frediano. In the 17th-century, the monastery was given to the Vallumbrosan Order, which remained here in 1810, the church then becoming a parish church.Tigri, page 191. Description The church gained its present appearance at the time of Buono in 1159, rebuilt in the Pistoiese Romanesque style. Characteristic of this style is the fa√ßade, divided into five compartments with arches supported by slender columns, and with a marble bichrome decoration. The portal in the facade is graced with notable Romanesque sculptures; the architrave has a row of standing individuals in togas, depicting \\"Jesus with the Twelve Apostles\\" (dated to 1167). Above are two male lions, one atop a guarding a recumbant man, the other atop a bird. Above the portal is a latin script. The interior was much changed over the centuries, but a restoration held in 1951-1961 brought it to the original appearance. In the apse was found a Christ in Majesty between Saints and Angels from the late 13th century, attributed to Manfredino d'Alberto. The pulpit sculpted in the mid 13th century by Guido da Como was also restored. The wooden crucifix in the high altar is from an unknown sculptor with a style resembling that of Giovanni Pisano.

Wildlife-friendly overpasses and underpasses have helped restore connectivity in the landscape for wolves, bears, elk, and other species. Rewilding is large-scale conservation aimed at restoring and protecting natural processes and core wilderness areas, providing connectivity between such areas, and protecting or reintroducing apex predators and keystone species. Rewilding projects may require ecological restoration or wilderness engineering, particularly to restore connectivity between fragmented protected areas, and reintroduction of predators and keystone species where extirpated. The ultimate goal of rewilding efforts is to create ecosystems requiring passive management by limiting human control of ecosystems. Successful long term rewilding projects should be considered to have little to no human-based ecological management, as successful reintroduction of keystone species creates a self-regulatory and self-sustaining stable ecosystem, with near pre- human levels of biodiversity. Origin The word rewilding was coined by members of the grassroots network Earth First!, appearing in print by 1990,Jennifer Foote, \\"Trying to Take Back the Planet,\\" Newsweek, 5 February 1990. and was refined by conservation biologists Michael Soul√© and Reed Noss in a paper published in 1998. According to Soul√© and Noss, rewilding is a conservation method based on \\"cores, corridors, and carnivores.\\" The concepts of cores, corridors, and carnivores were developed further in 1999. Dave Foreman subsequently wrote the first full-length exegesis of rewilding as a conservation strategy. More recently, anthropologist Layla AbdelRahim offered a new definition of rewilding: \\"Wilderness is ... a cumulative topos of diversity, movement, and chaos, while wildness is a characteristic that refers to socio-environmental relationships\\". According to her, because civilization is a constantly growing enterprise, it has completely colonized the earth and imperiled life on the planet. Therefore, rewilding can start only with a revolution in the anthropology that constructs the human as predator. History Rewilding was developed as a method to preserve functional ecosystems and reduce biodiversity loss, incorporating research in island biogeography and the ecological role of large carnivores. In 1967, The Theory of Island Biogeography by Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson established the importance of considering the size and isolation of wildlife conservation areas, stating that protected areas remained vulnerable to extinctions if small and isolated. In 1987, William D. Newmark's study of extinctions in national parks in North America added weight to the theory. The publications intensified debates on conservation approaches. With the creation of the Society for Conservation Biology in 1985, conservationists began to focus on reducing habitat loss and fragmentation. Elements required for successful rewilding Rewilding aims to restore three key ecological processes: trophic complexity, dispersal, and stochastic disturbances. Rewilding is important on land but perhaps more important is where land meets the water. Dam removal is the first of many steps in the process of rewilding in the riverine ecosystems. However, there are problems that should be addressed before, during, and after the dam removal. The problems are the sediments that have built up and wash out filling in spawning beds should be controlled and directed, then eliminating any and all clear cutting of trees near river banks as it raises the temperature of the water, and stopping industrial discharges for obvious reasons. At 90 different dam sites it has been confirmed that after a dam is built the ecosystem does rebound. However, the trend will eventually slow, stop and in some cases decline. This is often due to anthropogenic chemical, light, and noise pollution as the large bodies of water draw human activity and recreation. Nemecek writes that, \\"researchers found that the number of species within any given area dropped by 50%. Lastly, food sources for native animals and fish need to be introduced so as to improve the long-term sustainability of native species and curtail and/or eliminate the introduction of invasive species. Key species The beaver is by far the most important element of a riverine ecosystem. Firstly, the dams they build create micro ecosystems that can be used as spawning beds for salmon and collect invertebrates for the salmon fry to feed on. The dams, again built by beavers, create wetlands for plant, insect, and bird life. Specific trees, alder, birch, cottonwood, and willow are important to beaver's diets and must be encouraged to grow in areas accessible by the animals. In terms of seeding the birds can do much of the rest. These animals have a trickle down effect as they create ecosystems that have the potential to grow exponentially. Major rewilding projects Between 800 and 1150 wild koniks live in the Oostvaardersplassen, a over 56 km¬≤ rewilding project in the Netherlands. The horses were reintroduced together with heck cattle and red deer to keep the landscape open by natural grazing. This provided habitat for geese who are key species in the wetlands of the area. The grazing of geese Made it possible for reetlands to remain and therefor conserved many protected birds species. This is a prime example how water and land ecosystems are connected and how reintroducing keystone species can conserve other protected species. Both grassroots groups and major international conservation organizations have incorporated rewilding into projects to protect and restore large-scale core wilderness areas, corridors (or connectivity) between them, and apex predators, carnivores, or keystone species (species which interact strongly with the environment, such as elephant and beaver). Projects include the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative in North America (also known as Y2Y) and the European Green Belt, built along the former Iron Curtain; transboundary projects, including those in southern Africa funded by the Peace Parks Foundation; community-conservation projects, such as the wildlife conservancies of Namibia and Kenya; and projects organized around ecological restoration, including Gondwana Link, regrowing native bush in a hotspot of endemism in southwest Australia, and the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, restoring dry tropical forest and rainforest in Costa Rica. European Wildlife, established in 2008, advocates the establishment of a European Centre of Biodiversity at the German‚ÄìAustrian‚ÄìCzech borders. In North America, another major project aims to restore the prairie grasslands of the Great Plains. The American Prairie Reserve is reintroducing bison on private land in the Missouri Breaks region of north-central Montana, with the goal of creating a prairie preserve larger than Yellowstone National Park. Dam removal has led to the restoration of many river systems in the Pacific Northwest. This has been done in an effort to restore salmon populations specifically but with other species in mind. \\"These dam removals provide perhaps the best example of large-scale environmental remediation in the twenty-first century. This restoration, however, has occurred on a case-by-case basis, without a comprehensive plan. The result has been to put into motion ongoing rehabilitation efforts in four distinct river basins: the Elwha and White Salmon in Washington and the Sandy and Rogue in Oregon.\\" An organization called Rewilding Australia has formed which intends to restore various marsupials and other Australian animals which have been extirpated from the mainland, such as Eastern quolls and Tasmanian devils.. = Projects in Europe = European bison (Bison bonasus); Europe's largest living land animal. The European bison was driven to extinction in the wild in 1927; in the mid-20th century and early 21st century, the bison has been re-introduced into the wild. The bison stands nearly 2 metres tall and weighs as much as 1,000 kg. In the 1980s, the Dutch government began introducing proxy species in the Oostvaardersplassen nature reserve in order to recreate a grassland ecology. Though not explicitly referred to as rewilding, nevertheless many of the goals and intentions of the project were in line with those of rewilding. The reserve is considered somewhat controversial due to the lack of predators and other native megafauna such as wolves, bears, lynx, elk, boar, and wisent. Since the 1980s, 8.5 million trees have been planted in the United Kingdom in an area of the midlands around the villages of Moira and Donisthorpe, close to Leicester. The area is called The National Forest.The Guardian - How Millions of Trees Brought a Broken Landscape Back to Life Another, larger, reforestation project, aiming to plant 50 million trees is beginning in South Yorkshire, called The Northern Forest.The Woodland Trust - The Northern Forest, Our Vision Despite this, the UK government has been criticised for not achieving its tree planting goals.BBC News - FactcheckThe Guardian - Tree Planting in England Falls 71% Short of Government Target Knepp Castle and Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation have overseen reintroductions of extinct bird species in the UK.The Guardian - Storks are Back in Britain In 2011, the 'Rewilding Europe' initiative was established with the aim of rewilding 1 million hectares of land in ten areas including the western Iberian Peninsula, Velebit, the Carpathians and the Danube delta by 2020, mostly abandoned farmland among other identified candidate site.http://www.rewildingeurope.com/about-us/the-foundation/ The present project considers only species that are still present in Europe, such as the Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx, wolf, European jackal, Brown bear, chamois, Spanish ibex, European bison, red deer, griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, Egyptian vulture, Great white pelican and horned viper, along with a few primitive breeds of domestic horse and cattle as proxies for the extinct tarpan and aurochs. Since 2012, Rewilding Europe is heavily involved in the Tauros Programme, which seeks to recreate the phenotype of the aurochs, the wild ancestors of domestic cattle by selectively breeding existing breeds of cattle. Many projects also employ domestic water buffalo as a grazing proxy for the extinct European water buffalo.. thumbHistoric range of the European bison. In 2010 and 2011, an unrelated initiative in the village of San Cebri√°n de Mud√° (190 inhabitants) in Palencia, northern Spain released 18 European bisons (a species extinct in Spain since the Middle Ages) in a natural area already inhabited by roe deer, wild boar, red fox and grey wolf, as part of the creation of a 240-hectare \\"Quaternary Park\\". Three Przewalski horses from a breeding center in Le Villaret, France were added to the park in October 2012. Onagers and \\"aurochs\\" were planned to follow. On 11 April 2013, eight European bison (one male, five females and two calves) were released into the wild in the Bad Berleburg region of Germany, after 300 years of absence from the region. In 2014 the German government built a 3 km road tunnel to remove an Autobahn from the Leutratal und Cospoth nature reserve.Zeit - An Autobahn Disappears In 2016 and 2018, the True Nature Foundation reintroduced in total 7 European bison of the Lowland-Caucasian breeding line in Anciles Wildlife Reserve in the Parque Regional de Picos de Europa in the Cantabrian mountains in northern Spain. Pleistocene rewilding Saiga antelope are one of the animals which are proposed to be reintroduced in Pleistocene Park, a massive proposal of Pleistocene rewilding in Siberia. Once possessing a natural range from Alaska to France, Saigas are now extinct in Europe and North America, as well as a critically endangered species. Pleistocene rewilding was proposed by the Brazilian ecologist Mauro Galetti in 2004. He suggested the introduction of elephants (and other proxies of extinct megafauna) from circuses and zoos to private lands in the Brazilian cerrado. In 2005, stating that much of the original megafauna of North America‚Äîincluding mammoths, ground sloths, and sabre-toothed cats‚Äîbecame extinct after the arrival of humans, Paul S. Martin proposed restoring the ecological balance by replacing them with species which have similar ecological roles, such as Asian or African elephants. A reserve now exists for formerly captive elephants on the Brazilian Cerrado. A controversial 2005 editorial in Nature, signed by a number of conservation biologists, took up the argument, urging that elephants, lions, and cheetahs could be reintroduced in protected areas in the Great Plains. The Bolson tortoise, discovered in 1959 in Durango, Mexico, was the first species proposed for this restoration effort, and in 2006 the species was reintroduced to two ranches in New Mexico owned by media mogul Ted Turner. Other proposed species include various camelids, equids, and peccaries. In 1988, researcher Sergey A. Zimov established Pleistocene Park in northeastern Siberia to test the possibility of restoring a full range of grazers and predators, with the aim of recreating an ecosystem similar to the one in which mammoths lived. Yakutian horses, reindeer, snow sheep, elk, yak and moose were reintroduced, and reintroduction is also planned for bactrian camels, red deer, and Siberian tigers. The wood bison, a close relative of the ancient bison that died out in Siberia 1000 or 2000 years ago, is also an important species for the ecology of Siberia. In 2006, 30 bison calves were flown from Edmonton, Alberta to Yakutsk and placed in the government-run reserve of Ust'-Buotama. This project remains controversial ‚Äî a letter published in Conservation Biology accused the Pleistocene camp of promoting \\"Frankenstein ecosystems,\\" stating that \\"the biggest problem is not the possibility of failing to restore lost interactions, but rather the risk of getting new, unwanted interactions instead.\\"  See also  *Conservation biology *Conservation movement *Great Green Wall *Involuntary park *Natural landscape *Reintroducing *Panthera Corporation *Wildlife management  References  Further reading *Foreman, Dave (2004).

The church is medieval dating from the 13th century.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner In 1883, restoration of the church was carried out by A.R. Barker, at the instigation of the vicar Rev. Alfred Dicker.J. C. Cox (1911) Isle of Wight: its churches and religious houses The simple layout of the church consists of a nave, a chancel, northern and southern aisles, and a tower. It was built on the site of an older structure which was donated by William FitzOsbern to the Lyre Abbey. Subsequently, the church came under the control of the Beaulieu Abbey. When this religious authority was dissolved, the control of the church was entrusted by Henry VIII to the Bishop of Bristol (now Gloucester and Bristol). The church was one of the seven parishes on the Island when it was built, but now is part of several others. The unique white timber clad tower contains a small peal of six bells with a tenor weighing just 7 cwt or 350 kg. Geography All Saints' Church is located at the north end of the village of Newchurch. On the west side of the church, the road has a steep descent which gives the impression that the church is on a bluff. The geographic setting has been described by Venables, a poet as: \\"To the north the gazes embraces the whole of the vale of Newchurch with the undulating ridge of the chalks down beyond, ending towards the valley of the Medina in the abrupt Slope of the St.George‚Äôs Down. The white cliffs of Culver‚Ä¶\\" History All Saints' Church is an ancient cruciform structure. Although it was one of the six churches given by William FitzOsbern to an Lyra Abbey in Normandy, Henry VIII was later to give it to the See of Bristol. Living quarters are in a vicarage which included 3 acres of glebe. Architecture =Exterior= The church of All Saints' is a 13th-century cruciform structure with a south porch. The exterior features a red-tiled roof, walls of rough sandstone, a weatherboarded tower, a south porch, and a short spire. The nave's roof and the exterior of the north aisle appear barn-like. =Interior= The earliest building must have been of the 12th century, as there is evidence of 13th century additions. The transept piers do not bond into the east wall of the nave, which, with its thick wall, probably formed part of the original church. The eastern arches of the aisles spring from plain-splayed imposts, and the starting pier of the south aisle does not bond into the west wall. The 13th century builders practically remodelled the whole structure, leaving it much as it is today‚Äîa nave of three bays, a fourth being formed by the transept arches, north and south aisles, a long chancel, north and south transepts and a south porch supporting a wooden tower containing six bells. The massive piers at the entrance to the transepts suggest a central tower. Both transepts are singularly deep and must have been original features, though the south one has been lengthened , probably in the 16th century when the east window was inserted. The aisles must have been undertaken later in the century, as they are not in alignment with the transept piers. They both end in pointed arches, that to the north being splayed inwards for some ritual purpose, while the south one was rebuilt when the way to the rood-loft was cut through in the 15th century. The south wall of the nave is lighted by 14th century windows with cusped heads, and has been raised to admit of their insertion. The north wall is pierced by two windows and a door of the 13th century, the westernmost window having been converted into a single round-headed light in the 17th century. The entrance to the roof-loft still remains, with its steps on the aisle side. It has a semicircular head, from which springs the cross arch of the aisle with its two rings of voussoirs. In the south wall is a priest's door. For some structural reason, its east and south walls have been rebuilt in the 16th century, and it is probable that at this time, the south transept was lengthened and the porch widened eastward to form the sub-structure of a wooden tower containing the three bells mentioned in the inventory of 1553. The west wall of the nave appears to be all of one date‚Äîc. 1200‚Äî and is pierced with three original windows, a small narrow lancet in each aisle, a circular window with simple cusped filling in the centre of the gable. The crown of the west entrance has been lowered to admit of the insertion of a large 'churchwarden' window and the external jambs have been replaced with plain cut stone. 250px It is probable that the Dillingtons were responsible for the churchwarden creations in the north transept, and the west wall, and the final remodelling of the tower. There are two small chapels succeeding the two transepts. Over the gable of the south transeptal chapel, a \\"singular SAINTS or SANCTE BELL turret\\" has been erected (the bell was first struck when the image of the Saint was deified). In the porch, there are inscriptions in Latin on two tablets that record the generous contribution made by Richard Gard to establishing a grammar school which was founded by Richard Andrews, in 1595. The oak pulpit with its quaint sounding-board and canopy, as also the carved 'Pelican' lectern said to have been brought from Frome, belong to the Dillington period. There are memorials (eight inscriptions) in the north transept to the Dillington family, 1674 to 1749, wall tablets to Lieutenant General Maurice Bockland (Member of Parliament from Yarmouth; d. 1765), W. Bowles (d. 1748), an author, and William Thatcher, 1776. Over the south door is a panel with the royal arms of William III, dated 1700. ;Chancel The chancel, unusually long for its width, is lighted on the north by the three blunt lancets already referred to, on the east and south by three-light 16th century windows. The original north wall of the chancel still remains with its blunt-lancet, ungrooved window openings. Over the chancel arch is a wide splayed lancet window or opening of early 13th century detail. The transept and chancel arches are very massive in appearance, with pointed heads and triple-splayed orders springing from slightly curved abaci, forming a continuous moulding round the piers. This responds in clumsy square bases the whole thickness of the wall, as if intended for a stop to some feature since removed. A chancel roof space is of unknown purpose. ;Vaults In the 17th and 18th centuries, a certain amount of renovation was done by the Dillingtons, then owners of Knighton Gorges Manor. Both transepts appealed to them as excellent places for family vaults, so in 1688, Sir Robert Dillington (ca. 1664‚Äì1689) obtained a faculty to build a vault in the north transept. In 1725, the south transept received their attention as a further burial place for the family, the Dillington baronetcy having become extinct four years earlier. Fittings There are six bells, four of which were founded in 1810 by Thomas Mears of London; the other two are inscribed 'ANNO 5189 [1589]. ANTHONY BOND MADE ME 1626.' The ancient communion pieces consist of a chalice high and in diameter, with the date 1620 pricked on the cover. The alms-dish is inscribed 'The gift of Mrs. Dillington to the Parish of Newchurch anno 1737.' There is also a Sheffield plate flagon, probably given at the same time, inscribed 'DEO ET ALTARI SACRUM.' A register has records of many events since 1582, and which includes information of a Chichester earthquake that occurred on 30 November 1811 at 3.20 am, which was felt in Portsmouth at Rydes and in many other parts of the Isle of Wight. The church has a pipe organ by Bevington dating from 1857. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Fresco of the Blessing Christ. Sant'Andrea (Pieve di Sant'Andrea) is a church in Pistoia, Tuscany, central Italy that served as a pieve or place that congregations from surrounding village churches use for baptism. It is dedicated to St. Andrew the Apostle, and includes the famous Pulpit of Sant' Andrea by Giovanni Pisano. The church probably dates from as early as the 8th century, though in a smaller size. In the 12th century it was extended in length. The fa√ßade shows the typical bichrome marble decoration of the Pistoiese Romanesque style, executed in the mid-12th century by Gruamonte and his brother Adeodatus, who was also responsible for the sculptures and for the portal's architrave. The latter depicts the \\"Journey of the Magi\\", a rare theme whose use here derives from the fact that the church was located on the Via Francigena, by which, in the Middle Ages, the pilgrims reached Rome from France. The decorated capitals are by a Master Henry, while the small statue of St. Andrew in the lunette over the portal is reminiscent of Giovanni Pisano's style. In the late 15th century the upper fa√ßade was finished and the central nave was vaulted. The frescoes in the apse date to 1506, executed by Bernardino del Signoraccio. Today only the central part, with the Father supported by Four Angels, survives. The altars in the aisles were added in the 17th century, with paintings by artists such as Cristofano Allori, Alessio Gimignani, and Girolamo Scaglia.

Created in response to feedback and suggestions from the Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) and Teen Fans of Lego (TFOL) communities, the sets in this series are generally intended for more advanced builders. Most sets contain more than 2,000 total pieces and make use of unorthodox building techniques not usually utilized in previous official Lego sets. In contrast to most Lego sets aimed at children and adolescents, the suggested age of most sets in the Modular Buildings series is 16 years or older. The Modular Buildings sets have been received with positive reviews and are considered by Lego designers and fans as \\"toys for adults\\". History In 2006, a poll was taken, aimed at the AFOL community. Adult fans were asked to share their ideas and opinions about what concept they would like to see for a future model from the Lego Group. Some of the common ideas submitted were more town and everyday buildings, structures with more architectural detail, realistic buildings, minifigure scale buildings, solid and enclosed buildings. These ideas were taken into consideration and a year later the first set in the Modular Buildings series, Caf√© Corner, was released. Some LEGO fans were invited to provide feedback and suggestions during the design of the set. All sets in the series can also be joined together to form a larger neighborhood layout of several buildings standing adjacent to each other. Connectors at the base of the models are aligned for easy connection with other models in the series. Sets =Caf√© Corner= Caf√© Corner (set number: 10182) was the first of the Modular Buildings series sold exclusively through Lego shops. It was originally released in April 2007 at a MSRP of US$139. The set contains 2056 pieces and is recommended for builders 10 years of age or older. Some of the set features include a three floor building set on a street corner, a vertical 'Hotel' sign, opening doors and windows, caf√© tables and umbrellas, a striped awning and three minifigures. Many unusual building techniques were incorporated, such as annexes, fanned minifigure-sized skis as decoration, angled corner, and a 3D fa√ßade. Fanned minifigure skis During development of this first set in the series, the designer team led by Jamie Berard considered the cost of several options. One more expensive version had additional caf√© features, dark green interior walls, a bike and an additional minifigure. In contrast, a lower cost version of the set was considered which lacked rear exterior walls, interior stairs, and extra interior walls on the second floor, and had only two minifigures but no bike. Lego fans could suggest improvements to the initial prototypes such as adding color to the roof, which was originally gray, and translucent elements to the hotel sign. = Market Street = Market Street (set number: 10190) was the second of the Modular Buildings series and designed by Dutch Lego fan Eric Brok under the Lego Factory theme, a theme composed of sets primarily designed by fans of Lego and not by the Lego design team. It was originally released as a follow-up to Caf√© Corner in 2007 and priced at MSRP of US$89. The set contains 1236 pieces and is recommended for builders 10 years of age or older. It was one of the first leading buildings. The set features include opening doors and windows, a gate, a striped awning, and three minifigures. Advanced construction techniques used in Market Street include: curved staircases, \\"stripped paint\\" sections on the walls, interchangeable floors, Dutch/Belgian stepped roof, a basement, offset windows, and wrought iron-look decoration and gate. Market Street is a unique set in the Modular Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and is recommended for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller than the others was to provide a lower cost entry point into the Modular Buildings series. Prior to 2018, this was the only Modular Building set to have minifigures that did not all have the Lego classic smile face. Market Street is the only set in the series to be released with Lego Factory branding on the box ‚Äî and as such is sometimes questioned how official it was intended to be as a Modular Buildings entry as it was designed by a fan rather than a Lego designer. Eric Brok, a fan from the Netherlands, designed the set working closely with LEGO designers. =Green Grocer= Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was the third of the Modular Buildings series. It was originally released in 2008 at a MSRP of US$149/¬£99. The set contains 2352 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Some of the set features include a blue and white awning, opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and four minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and hinges to make a bay window. Green Grocer differs from the previous two sets in the series because it has a greater level of detail inside. Whereas Caf√© Corner and Market Street had bare interiors, each floor in Green Grocer contains a prop such as a radiator or some furniture. The first floor is fully furnished as a grocery store with refrigerated shelves with opening doors and cartons of food. The assortment of Lego food pieces in the grocery includes carrots, apples, and bananas. There is also a stairway to the apartment above and a mailbox set with letters. =Fire Brigade= Lego Modular - Set 10197 Fire Brigade Fire Brigade (set number 10197) was the fourth set in the Modular Buildings series released in September 2009. The set contains 2231 pieces, was priced at MSRP US$149/‚Ç¨149, and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a 1930s style fire truck, and four minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular to come with a vehicle, the 1930s-style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding garage door. New building techniques introduced with this set include a method of creating numbers built into the structure using standard Lego bricks. On the front of the building the year 1932 appears, which is a reference to when Lego was founded. The number 3 also appears on the pavement of the set representing that this is the third set on the series from Lego set designer Jamie Berard, who had previously designed Caf√© Corner and Green Grocer. =Grand Emporium= Lego Modular - Set 10211 Grand Emporium Grand Emporium (set number 10211) is the fifth set in the Modular Buildings series and second corner building released in March 2010. The set contains 2182 pieces, was priced at MSRP US$149/‚Ç¨149, and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. Modeled to look like a realistic early 20th century department store, the set includes an exterior with an ice cream stand, store window displays, window washer platform, and rooftop billboard. Interior details for the three-floor building include an escalator, dressing room, and a wide assortment of merchandise. It is built as a block corner building, similarly to Caf√© Corner, Palace Cinema, Brick Bank, and Corner Garage. There are seven minifigures, including two that are decorated with blank faces to look like mannequins. =Pet Shop= Lego Modular - Set 10218 Pet Shop Pet Shop (set number 10218) is the sixth set in the Modular Buildings series released in May 2011. The set contains 2032 pieces, was priced at MSRP US$149/‚Ç¨149, and is recommended for builders 16 years of age or older. It is the first set in the series that is actually two buildings that separate using the same Technic pins that link the rest of the modular buildings together. They can be reversed or separated and wrapped around another building. The brown building is a brownstone-style town house with elevated ground floor atop a crawl-space and the sand blue building is the Pet Shop. The brown building was the second building after Market Street that had a basement. There is a feature on the Pet Shop on the ground floor where the staircase can be folded away for more access room for playing as this was an issue with Market Street. There are four minifigures, two parrots, one dog, one cat, and a fish tank with goldfish. The set also includes three dog bones, a ball, a frog toy, a birdhouse, a bucket, and a brush. Until the Brick Bank, this was also the shortest set by height and stands at just over 25 cm. The next tallest modular is Market Street at 33 cm. The set includes a full interior including a toilet, bed, kitchen, and fireplace. =Town Hall= Lego Modular - Set 10224 Town Hall Town Hall (set number 10224) was released in March 2012 and is the seventh set in the Modular Building line. The set contains 2766 pieces and is recommended for builders 14 and over. It is the tallest Modular set, taking the title from the Green Grocer, having three floors with generally higher ceilings than the norm, plus a clock and bell tower on the roof. It contains many interior details, such as a working elevator, along with board tables and balconies to look to the floor below. Along with the many interior decor details, the building features the pilastered portico and brick fa√ßade treatments of United States Colonial Revival architecture. The 1891 date on the building represents the birth year of the founder of Lego and when reversed, it is the birth year of the designer, Astrid Graab√¶k (1981). The set was priced at ¬£149.99/US$199.99/‚Ç¨179.99 when released by Lego on 16 February 2012. There are eight minifigures in the set including a wedding couple. The set had a global discontinuation date of 31 December 2014 and had a much shorter lifespan than its predecessors. =Palace Cinema= Palace Cinema (set number 10232) was released in March 2013 at a MSRP of US$149/‚Ç¨139. It is the eighth set in the Modular Building line and the third corner building. The set contains 2194 pieces and features architectural homage to the Egyptian Revival architecture of the early 20th century, albeit with Chinese-like cultural appropriations similar to Hollywood's Grauman's Chinese Theatre. As such, it also features Hollywood Walk of Fame type printed star tiles for the outer sidewalk, LEGO elements that returned to decorate the walls in 2018's Downtown Diner. Palace Cinema is the first Modular Building set to be released with the Lego Creator Expert branding on its box and was the first to include stickers. Some of these are movie posters containing Lego in-jokes such as the ubiquitous brick separator tool used to disassemble (Godzilla-like \\"The Brick Separator\\"), the time-consuming sorting of Lego elements (\\"Forever Sorting\\"), and Lego's iconic 1990 red Airport Shuttle #6399 set (\\"Mystery On The Monorail\\"). Also, Palace Cinema was the first of the Modular Building sets to have only two floors (albeit with higher ceilings than the norm) instead of the usual three and the second to include a vehicle: a black car styled loosely on a convertible Buick. The ground floor is the ticket and concessions area leading up to the theater floor housing a reel-to-reel projector showing a black and white motion picture to a maximum seating of six. This floor also has stairs accessing the roof, atop which the two brick-built promotional searchlights can be placed. The set includes six minifigures. =Parisian Restaurant= Parisian Restaurant (set number 10243) is the ninth set in the Modular Building line and was released in January 2014 at a MSRP of US$159/‚Ç¨149. This set contains 2469 pieces and has a fully stocked, blue and white tiled kitchen with tableware serving two interior tables, two street-side tables (on a patio tiled in a subtle design with the word \\"CHEZ\\"), and two upper terrace tables. On the first upper floor (terrace level) is as an apartment with pull-down Murphy bed, kitchenette and fireplace. On the top floor is the artist's studio that includes a cast iron heater, easel, paintbrush, and two works of Mondrian-style Modernist art. This is a nod to the fact that the original Lego brick color palette of red, blue, yellow, black, and white were chosen based on Mondrian's art.\\"Lego\\" The Toys the Made Us Outside the upper floor stairs lead down to the roof terrace for diners lined with hanging lanterns and flowers. This set also includes hard-to-find white croissants and brick elements in olive green, dark blue, and dark red. Advanced exterior details include fa√ßade with croissant detailing, sidewalk, bench, scooter, and a dumpster and trash can at the back. =Detective's Office= The Detective's Office (set number 10246) is the tenth set in the Modular Building line and was released 1 January 2015 at a MSRP of US$159/‚Ç¨149. This set contains 2262 pieces. It contains a detective's office, a barbershop named \\"Al's\\", a billiards table \\"pool\\" room, and an upstairs detective's office with a corridor. The \\"Al's\\" sign resembles the various brick-built lettering signs from the Pet Shop, Town Hall, and Fire Brigade. The featured \\"Pool\\" sign uses a building technique never used before. The interior of the pool room features a fan, a pool table, and a dart board. The detective office features clues, a cabinet, and a secret storage space behind a picture. The barbershop features a mirror, scissors, lights, and chairs for customers. The apartment holds an old-style toilet and a small kitchen. This Modular varies from previous buildings in that it introduced play features of a secretive or \\"illicit\\" nature: it has secret compartments that allow cookie smuggling throughout the building. It also is different because it is the first Modular to have two buildings on the same baseplate. The front of the building features a newspaper stand, a tree, and two balconies. It includes six minifigures. =Brick Bank= Brick Bank (set number 10251) is the eleventh set in the Modular Building line and is the shortest Modular in height, the fourth block corner building, and the first corner building to not feature a direct-corner entrance. It was released on 1 January 2016 and priced at MSRP US$169/‚Ç¨149. This set contains 2380 pieces. Like the Palace Cinema it contains only two furnished floors although it also had higher than normal ceilings like the Cinema. The Brick Bank features a bank, secretary's office, bank manager's office, laundromat, and a detailed fa√ßade and sidewalk. The bank features an atrium foyer with wide, arched entrance, triangular-patterned floor tiling, ornate chandelier, oxidized-copper colored skylight, transaction counter with hidden alarm buttons and security glass, and a bank vault with safe deposit boxes and a large round door. The laundromat features a printed window, tiled floor and four laundry machines‚Äîone of which contains an play feature for \\"laundering money\\": placing Lego money bills or coin elements through this machine will fall into a special deposit box inside the bank's vault. The rooftop also has another play feature for a robber to descend the chimney by rope and exit through a special entrance atop the bank vault. The secretary's office features a wall clock, desk, typewriter, cabinet with opening drawers, fireplace, and an espresso machine. The bank manager's office features a large desk with banker's lamp and approval stamp, leather-look chair, printed portrait, statue, and a cabinet. It includes five minifigures. The Brick Bank also introduced some rare elements such as a metalized-paint gold ingot and coins, and the less-common colors of Sand Blue and Sand Green. =Assembly Square= Lego Assembly Square Interior Assembly Square (set number: 10255) is the twelfth set in the Modular Building line. It was released on 1 January 2017 at a MSRP of US$279/‚Ç¨239. This set contains the most pieces of any previous Modular set at 4002 pieces as well as the most minifigures: nine when including an infant figure. The Assembly Square ground level features a bakery with counter, cash register, shelves, opening oven, wedding cake and assorted buildable pastries and treats; a florist's shop with counter, cash register, garden tools, flower arrangements, bouquets and a blue and yellow macaw parrot element; and a caf√© with an espresso machine, counter, bench seating and pie elements. The middle level features a music store with a buildable drum set, two guitars and saxophone element; photo studio with an \\"antique\\" large-format bellows camera atop an adjustable tripod; and a dental office with buildable reclining chair, waiting area, telephone and a sink. The upper level features a dance studio with buildable piano and reflective mirror element; an apartment with buildable foldout sofa bed, detailed kitchen, toilet, micro Lego train, modular buildings and Eiffel Tower, and access to a rooftop terrace with buildable barbecue, table and a neglected plant. This set marked the tenth anniversary of the Modular building sets and contains numerous \\"easter egg\\" references in the set's use of brick elements, colors, and architectural details used in Modular sets released over the previous years. =Downtown Diner= Downtown Diner (set number: 10260) is the thirteenth set in the Modular Building line. It was released on 1 January 2018 and contain 2,480 pieces with a MSRP of US$169/‚Ç¨149. This building reintroduces the teal color (what Lego calls Bright Blueish Green) that had not been in production since 2008. The first level of this building is a 1950s-style diner. It has a curved front window, red bar stools, a classic bubbler-style jukebox, soda fountain-equipped counter, and an open-plan kitchen. The middle level has a gym with boxing ring, punching bag, and weight training room. The upper level houses a recording studio, complete with vocal booth, mixing desk, and a cabinet for refreshments. The fa√ßade of the building features pink-and-teal 20th century Art Deco styling with a large pink \\"DINER\\" sign. Though Streamline Moderne style architecture first emerged in the 1930s, this modular has a more 1950s-style color treatment than the general era of previous Modulars (~1930s). Other external features include arched linteled windows, balconies, a wrought iron-style exterior staircase, and a detailed sidewalk complete with mailbox, parking meter, flower pots, and the iconic white streetlamp of the Modular collection. It is the third Modular set to include a vehicle: a 1950s-style convertible automobile recalling an homage to Elvis Presley's pink Cadillac. One of the minifigures also features an Elvis-style of pompadour hairstyle. For the first time since 2007's Market Street, the included six minifigures have individual, varied faces rather than the classic Lego smiley faces used in the previous sets. Subsequent Modular Buildings continued to use these stylized faces. =Corner Garage= Corner Garage (set number: 10264) is the fourteenth modular building and fifth corner building, released in January 2019. It became the third biggest set in the series, trailing the Town Hall and Assembly Square, with 2569 pieces and a price of US$200. The building resembles that of a 1950s-style American building, much like the Downtown Diner. Its bottom floor is made up of the garage, the middle floor has a veterinarian's office owned by a character named \\"Dr. Jones\\", and the top floor is an apartment with roof access. The set has six minifigures and, instead of the usual blocky-structure corner buildings offer, the set produces a 45-degree angle cut at the front. =Bookshop= Bookshop (set number: 10270) is the fifteenth set in Modular Building line, released in January 2020. The set comes with 2,504 pieces, retailing at US$179.99. The set consist of two separate buildings akin to the Pet Shop, making it the second set in the series that is actually two buildings that separate. The model features the \\"Birch Books\\" bookstore and an accompanying townhouse. The set is a return to more classical and European architecture from the last two more modern-American modular designs, Downtown Diner and Corner Garage. An autumn setting is portrayed throughout the set through the use of warm-colored leaves and the attire of the minifigures. The Bookshop was created by Lego designer Wes Talbott, who said the model was inspired by the houses of Amsterdam and the dollhouses that were built by his mother. The Bookshop's ground floor features a birch tree with several new colors of foliage elements, as well as a display window and store in medium nougat and light grey colors. The first floor features decorative white windows, a reading room with a grandfather clock, lamp, and sitting chair. The top floor of the bookshop has a dark red roof with light grey architectural details. The townhouse is built above a crawl-space basement with a staircase, garden, and lamp post. The first floor is teal with white accents and features a bay window, dining table and living area, while the roof has a complex build involving a varied roof-line, dark blue tiling, and dark grey top. The back part of the roof of each building breaks away to reveal two small bedrooms. The Bookshop comes with five minifigures and several mini-builds featuring a bookshelf with a printed \\"Moby Brick\\" book cover, four-poster bed, lamp, grandfather clock, and toy plane, as well as a bluebird and chameleon element in new colors. The five minifigures include a shopkeeper with glasses, an older man with grey hair, a young boy in a flannel jacket and lime green scarf, a woman with a purple top, and a man with suspenders and a tie.https://www.brothers-brick.com/2019/12/06/lego- creator-expert-modular-for-2020-revealed-as-10270-bookshop-news/#more-192665 Related sets =Mini Modulars= Lego Designer Jamie Berard created many Modulars Buildings and decided to make a mini version of his set for fun. Five of these were then released as a single set 10230 containing 1,356 pieces, each one on an 8x8 baseplate, making them quarter-scale with respect to the original buildings. Initially, this set was for Lego Group VIPs only, but it later became available for general sale. In October 2014, four sets similar to the Mini Modulars were released as Toys \\"R\\" Us exclusives. They are 40180 (Bricktober Theater), 40181 (Bricktober Pizza Place), 40182 (Bricktober Fire Station) and 40183 (Bricktober Town Hall). Despite the similarity of names, they are not mini versions of existing modular buildings; they are new designs. They are simpler builds than the original Mini Modulars, based on 6x8 plates, and each one includes two vehicles; the target age is given as 7 and up. In October 2015, four new sets were released for Toys \\"R\\" Us Bricktober. They are 40141 ‚Äì Bricktober Hotel (204 pcs), 40142 - Bricktober Train Station (180 pcs), 40143 -Bricktober Bakery (234 pcs), 40144 - Bricktober Toys \\"R\\" Us store (165 pcs). This time the base is 8x8 and 8x10 (and the boxes are thicker, but otherwise same size). As last time they each include two vehicles. =Ninjago City= Ninjago City (set number 70620), a large 4867 piece set, was released in late August 2017 at a MSRP of US$299/‚Ç¨299 to coincide with the release of the Lego Ninjago Movie. Although not advertised as a modular building, it features the same structure as the regular modulars with a 32√ó32 stud baseplate, building connectors and a river matching the same dimensions as the sidewalk. It is a huge multi-level model with levels themed differently. The bottom levels contain the \\"old world\\" with an old fashioned fish market; the middle levels contain \\"the street\\" with a modern comic store, crab restaurant and a retail store; and the top levels ‚Äìnamed \\"high rise\\"‚Äì contain a sushi restaurant topped with a \\"Dragon Gate\\" (see Feng shui) and communications assembly‚Äîas well as a small living apartment for the title \\"Green Ninja\\" character Lloyd Garmadon and his mother. The set comes with 16 different minifigures. =Ninjago City Docks= Ninjago City Docks (set number 70657) is a set with 3553 pieces, and was released in July 2018. It connects to the regular modulars and fits the Ninjago City, with which it shares the basic layout of river, bottom-leveled \\"old-world, and middle-leveled \\"street\\". Unlike its predecessor it does not feature the \\"high-rise\\"-levels, but extends over an enlarged baseplate of 48x32 studs. The bottom levels contain the \\"old world\\" with a harbour, a grocer, and a sculptor's workshop, as well as a dojo, a map room, and a small home. The \\"street\\"-levels host a tea room and an arcade. Challenges A challenge faced by the designers of these sets is that they are not able to work with the full palette of Lego bricks and colors ever produced when designing. Instead, they are limited to the bricks and colors currently in production by Lego at the time of the product design. As an example, for Caf√© Corner, the designer wanted to include a bicycle piece in the set, but at the time, the machine that made bicycle pieces was broken. It had to be fixed in order for the designer to be able to include the piece in his design. With Market Street, the fan designer was limited to only the bricks and color combinations available as 'active components,' meaning bricks that were already in production. No new bricks could be introduced. There have been scheduling challenges faced in the design of the Modular Houses sets. For the Green Grocer set, the designer believed that the set could have benefited from another design iteration before release. The detailed nature of these sets requires a greater amount of design time than a normal Lego set. It is expected that future sets in the series will not suffer from such schedule pressures. During the design of Caf√© Corner (and presumably with the other sets in the series), the designer had to work closely with the building instructions team due to some of the \\"unorthodox techniques\\" that he used \\"which have not been tried before in official Lego sets.\\" The reason interiors were not included in the first two models in the series, Caf√© Corner and Market Street, was because they could not be seen in the pictures included on the packaging. Once the success of Modular Buildings sets had been proven with these first two sets, for the third set, Green Grocer, the designer was allowed to include interior details in each of the floors. As a result, many of the interior details of later sets, such as Green Grocer, are not visible on the box and are only discovered while building the set. However, the boxes of each set feature some of the interior details such as the escalators inside Grand Emporium and pool table inside Detective's Office. Reception The Modular Buildings series is viewed by Lego designers and fan sites as \\"toys for adults\\". Product reviews have been very positive with the biggest criticisms being price and degree of difficulty. With Caf√© Corner, one reviewer complained that the interior of the building was bare of any finishing. This complaint was addressed in later models such as Green Grocer, which had finished interior details included in each of its three floors. When the first set in the series, Caf√© Corner, was released, the designer indicated that more sets would follow in the series only if sales of the first set were successful. In a later interview in 2008 covering the third set in the series, Green Grocer, the designer indicated that sales had been strong enough to support four sets in the series (referring to the planned 2009 release of Fire Brigade as the fourth set).

The pulpit in the pieve of Sant'Andrea, Pistoia, Italy is a masterpiece by the Italian sculptor Giovanni Pisano. The work is often compared to the pulpits sculpted by Giovanni's father Nicola Pisano in the Baptistery of Pisa and the Duomo of Siena, which Giovanni had assisted with. These very advanced works are often described in terms such as \\"proto- Renaissance\\", and draw on Ancient Roman sarcophagi and other influences to form a style that represents an early revival of classical sculpture, while also remaining Gothic, and drawing on sources such as French ivory carvings.Pope-Hennessy, 1-3; Olson, 11-24; White, Chapter 5 History According to an inscription running between the pulpit's arcades and parapets, it was commissioned by Canon Arnoldus (Arnoldo) and supervised by the treasurers Andrea Vitelli and Tino di Vitale. Vasari says the commission was given in 1297, and the inscription records its completion in 1301. There is no false modesty: \\" Giovanni carved it, who performed no empty work. The son of Nicola, and blessed with higher skill, Pisa gave him birth, endowed with mastery greater than any seen before\\".White, 122 (quoted); Olson, 19 Giovanni was approaching the age of fifty when he began the work, and had worked on his father's projects, and possibly visited France. Description The structure is similar to the pulpit in Pisa: a hexagonal plan with seven columns (one in the middle), two of which are supported by lions and one by a stooping figure of Atlas, while the central one rests on three winged gryphons and the remaining ones on plain bases. The organization of the parapet's reliefs is inspired by the pulpit in Siena. The iconographic program is also inspired by Nicola's work, with \\"Allegories\\" in the pendentives of the arches, \\"Sibyls\\" and \\"Prophets standing on the capitals' tops, and the five parapets with the following scenes from the Life of Christ: *\\"Annunciation\\", \\"Nativity\\" with the apocryphal detail of the midwives bathing the baby Christ and an \\"Annunciation to the Shepherds\\" *\\"Dream of the Magi\\" *\\"Massacre of the Innocents\\" *\\"The Crucifixion\\" *\\"Last Judgement\\" The sixth parapet is missing, as its side provides access to the pulpit; the original stairway has now been removed. Style The scenes are as crowded and dramatic as those of the Sienese pulpit. Most notable is the scene of the \\"Massacre of the Innocents\\", for which it has been supposed that Giovanni took inspiration from German models, or even from the Trajan column in Rome. One of the Sibyls, portrayed in the sudden gesture of fleeing towards an angel, is also of particular distinction. For the first time Pisano tilted the reliefs, with the upper parts projecting further than the lower, to allow for the position of the viewer below.Olson, 19 File:Giovanni pisano, aquila dal pulpito di sant'andrea di pistoia 01.JPGThe lectern, in the form of the Eagle of St John File:Pistoia chiesa san andria 007.JPG \\"Massacre of the Innocents\\" File:Pistoia 200310 038 Crucifixion crop.JPGThe Crucifixion File:Giovanni pisano, pulpito di sant'andrea 10 crop.JPGThe Sybil and the Angel Notes References Henderson, George.

In the 14th century the chancel was rebuilt and the south porch was added. In the 15th century a chapel was added south of the chancel and east of the south aisle, and a four-centred arch was inserted in the south wall of the chancel to link it with the chapel. The north aisle was demolished, its arcade filled in and two-light Perpendicular Gothic windows inserted in each of the filled-in arches. The Perpendicular Gothic west tower was added towards the end of the 15th century. The square-headed windows in the south aisle were inserted in the 16th century and the spire was added to the tower probably early in the 17th century.

It has been placed in the \\"trimerophytes\\", a strongly paraphyletic group of early members of the lineage leading to modern ferns and seed plants., pp. 259-261 Description Pertica quadrifaria (the type species of the genus) was described in 1972 from compression fossils found in the Trout Valley Formation of northern Maine, USA. It was an upright plant which grew to perhaps as much as a metre (3 ft) in height. It comprised a main, straight stem (axis) with side branches which developed dichotomously, branching many times at increasingly shorter intervals. Some of the terminal branchlets bore masses of erect paired, ellipsoidal sporangia in distinctive tight clusters. The branches were arranged in a spiral pattern, forming four vertical rows. The specific epithet quadrifaria refers to this growth habit. Pertica varia was described in 1976 from the Devonian of Eastern Canada. It was considerably taller than P. quadrifaria, reaching a height of nearly 3 m. The sporangia were similar to those of P. quadrifaria, although there were fewer in each cluster. Pertica dalhousii was described in 1978 from fossils of Early or Middle Devonian age found in New Brunswick, Canada. The plant appears to have been similar to P. quadrifaria (only part is known), comprising a central stem (axis) with spirally arranged dichotomous side branches, some of which terminated in erect clusters of between 32 and 128 sporangia. Further specimens from the same rocks possibly belonged to another species of Pertica, but were not sufficiently well preserved to be named. Phylogeny The clear differentiation between a main stem (axis) and lateral branches in Pertica, as in other \\"trimerophytes\\", has been considered to represent an early stage in the development of a growth pattern that later led to the evolution of megaphylls (large true leaves). Consistent with this, a cladogram published in 2004 by Crane et al. places Pertica in a paraphyletic stem group basal to the seed plants (spermatophytes) which have such leaves. Other researchers have produced rather different analyses. Rothwell's analysis separates \\"trimerophytes\\", like Pertica, from progymnosperms, like Tetraxylopteris, with only the latter being closely related to seed plants.

It is the sole species in the genus Terlinguachelys and is classified in the family Protostegidae along with other extinct marine turtles. As an early sea turtle, Terlinguachelys already showed several characteristics typical of modern sea turtles. These included a dorsoventrally-flattened body, a comparatively large head with a short neck and the iconic flattened paddle-like arms that sea turtles distinctly possess. However, some anatomical differences identify the turtle as a more basal member of the sea turtle superfamily. The posterior portion of Terlinguachelys' mandible for example has several elements that are reduced in later forms. Whereas the posterior portions of modern sea turtles' mandibles are smoother and streamlined, that of Terlinguachelys has prominent fossae. The plates that comprise the carapace of the lone specimen exhumed were analyzed and somewhat indicated that they were not completely ossified, suggesting that this taxon is closer in relation to the leatherbacks rather than other modern marine turtles. Also, this particular species has a comparatively longer femur in proportion to its humerus than other species of marine turtle, extant and otherwise. The species was discovered in 1987. A lone specimen was unearthed from rocks located in the Aguja Formation of Texas, dated to be from Campanian deposits of the Late Cretaceous period. The type specimen, labeled as TMM 43072-1, consists of an incomplete turtle skeleton including parts of the skull, carapace and limbs. The turtle was named for the nearby town of Terlingua, Texas, just kilometers away from where the specimen was discovered.

Initially assaulted by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the Serbian Volunteer Guard (SDG), the town was encircled by the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) in May 1992, starting a brutal siege which was to last for the majority of the Bosnian War. In June 1995, the commander of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) in the enclave, Naser Oriƒá, left Srebrenica and fled to the town of Tuzla. He was subsequently replaced by his deputy, Major Ramiz Beƒáiroviƒá. In July 1995, Srebrenica fell to the combined forces of the Republika Srpska and numerous paramilitary formations which included hundreds of Greek and Russian volunteers in what was codenamed Operation Krivaja '95 (, –û–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –ö—Ä–∏–≤–∞—ò–∞ '95). The subsequent massacre of the town's male population led to the deaths of more than 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, and is considered the largest act of mass murder in Europe since the end of World War II. It was judged to have been a crime of genocide by international criminal courts. As a result, VRS General Radislav Krstiƒá was found guilty by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of murder, persecution and aiding and abetting genocide, while VRS General Zdravko Tolimir was also convicted of genocide. Both men were sentenced to life imprisonment. One of the indictments against Ratko Mladiƒá, the commander of the VRS during the war, is for the massacre in Srebrenica. The commander of Bosniak forces in the enclave, Naser Oriƒá, was found guilty of failing to prevent the mistreatment of VRS prisoners held in Srebrenica between September 1992 and March 1993. However, his conviction was overturned in 2008.  Background  Srebrenica is a small mining town in eastern Bosnia about fifteen kilometers from the Serbian border. According to a census held in 1991, 36,000 people lived in the municipality of Srebrenica, including 25,000 Bosnian Muslims (or Bosniaks) and 8,500 Serbs. This figure shows that about 75 percent of the municipal population was Bosniak and about 25 percent was Serb. The town of Srebrenica itself was inhabited by 9,000 people when Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. That January, a Bosnian Serb state was declared, ahead of the 29 February‚Äì1 March referendum on independence. Later renamed the Republika Srpska, it developed its own military as the JNA withdrew from Croatia and handed over its weapons, equipment and 55,000 troops to the newly created Bosnian Serb army. By 1 March, Bosnian Serb forces set up barricades in Sarajevo and elsewhere and later that month Bosnian Serb artillery began shelling the town of Bosanski Brod. By 4 April, Sarajevo was shelled. In May 1992, the ground forces of Bosnian Serb state officially became known as the Army of Republika Srpska (, VRS). By the end of 1992, the VRS held seventy percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the outbreak of the war, eastern Bosnia, a Bosniak-majority territory before the war, was subjected to ethnic cleansing operations and numerous atrocities involving murder, rape on a massive scale, plundering, and forced relocation by Serb forces and paramilitary gangs. Taking place throughout the municipalities of Srebrenica, Vlasenica, Rogatica, Bratunac, Vi≈°egrad, Zvornik and Foƒça, the purpose of these operations was to create in eastern Bosnia a contiguous Serb- controlled land having a common border with Serbia. Located in the heart of what Bosnian Serbs considered their territory, Srebrenica was seized by the paramilitary Serb Volunteer Guard (, or SDG) on 18 April 1992. According to a witness, \\"organized killings of the Muslim population began\\" on 21 April. On 6 May, a two-day battle between Serb and Muslim forces erupted in the town. Naser Oriƒá, a one-time member of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs and former bodyguard of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, then assumed control of Srebrenica after helping local Bosniak forces drive the SDG and other Serb paramilitary units from the town by 8 May. Goran Zekiƒá, the leader of the Serb population in the municipality, was killed in the fighting. In June, the Muslim population of Srebrenica established a local \\"war council\\". By December 1992, they had managed to gain control of up to 95 percent of the Srebrenica municipality and half of the neighbouring Bratunac municipality. By this time, Oriƒá's forces had established a sixty-kilometer-long Bosniak enclave which stretched from ≈Ωepa in the south to the village of Kamenica in the north, however only to be surrounded and in dire need of food by February 1993 while the population of the enclave grew to almost 40,000 as refugees from the surrounding ethnically cleansed towns and villages sought refuge in the town. Indeed, most of the enclave's residents were not originally from Srebrenica, but from all around eastern Bosnia or Podrinje.  Siege  In the words of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY): In his ICTY testimony, VRS Intelligence Chief Momir Nikoliƒá recounted how Bosnian Serb forces were instructed to make life in Srebrenica unbearable in order to induce its civilian population to \\"leave en masse as soon as possible, realizing they cannot survive there.\\" As part of this, Nikoliƒá conceded that civilians were targeted and humanitarian aid blocked while fuel, food and other supplies for UN peacekeepers were halted so that \\"they could not be ready for combat\\". While the Bosnian Serbs enjoyed military superiority, they were outnumbered by the Bosniaks who adopted a type of guerrilla warfare, which in the second half of 1992 and up to early 1993 was quite successful. In an attempt to press outward, Oriƒá and his men conducted a series of raids against outlying Serb villages, or from which Bosniaks had formerly been expelled, ostensibly to seize food, weapons, ammunition and military equipment, but also to exact punishment on the local Serb population for the VRS's harassment of the enclave. During these events, Bosniak forces committed apparent violations of humanitarian law against the Bosnian Serb inhabitants, especially from May 1992 to January 1993. The most notable of these violations occurred on 7 January 1993, when Oriƒá's men attacked the Serb village of Kravica, which bordered the Srebrenica enclave. Forty-three Serbs were killed in the attack, including 13 civilians. Oriƒá's forces destroyed many of the villages that fell into their hands during the siege, killing perhaps 1,000 Serb soldiers and civilians: while the number of Serb soldier fatalities is unknown, the Research and Documentation Center (RDC), an organisation that compiled the most comprehensive record of deaths during the Bosnian War, established that 158 Serb civilians died in the Srebrenica municipality during the war, while a further 127 died in the Bratunac municipality. In an earlier report, it concluded that 119 Serb civilians and 424 soldiers were killed in the Bratunac municipality. Thousands of others were displaced by such attacks, which resulted in the destruction of at least 50 Serb settlements, according to the ICTY. In addition, the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was shelled by the ARBiH. In January 1993, ARBiH soldiers machine-gunned dozens of Serb civilians fleeing the village of Skelani. In February 1993, a Srebrenica delegation visiting Sarajevo proposed that one Sarajevan Serb be killed for every Bosniak killed in Srebrenica. At this time, the Srebrenica enclave had reached its peak size of 900 square kilometers, although it was never linked to the main area of Bosnian-held land in the west and remained \\"a vulnerable island amid Serb-controlled territory.\\" In response, the VRS launched numerous operations against the town. In March 1993, General Ratko Mladiƒá of the VRS ordered the Bosnian Serb forces besieging the town to launch a large-scale counterattack. The attack resulted in the Bosnian Serbs capturing 80 percent of the territory of the Srebrenica enclave once held by the 28th Division of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). However, the VRS was forced to stop its offensive after the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 819, which called for talks between the Bosniak and Bosnian Serb military leadership and the de-militarization of Srebrenica which was declared a \\"safe-area\\". However, because of differing interpretations of the resolution, Srebrenica was never disarmed. Instead, it was surrounded by a force of approximately 2,000 men from the VRS Drina Corps, which continued its stranglehold of the enclave. Areas of military control in Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 1994; eastern Bosnian enclaves near the Serbian border The VRS shelled Srebrenica on 12 April 1993, killing at least 56 people and wounding 73. Within weeks, the town's population swelled from 9,000 to 40,000 as Bosniak refugees fled from the surrounding countryside. However, neither this counterattack nor the United Nation's designation of the town as a \\"safe area\\" ended Oriƒá's raids against neighbouring Serb villages, which persisted at a rate of 3‚Äì4 per week as Bosniak forces searched for food to steal from the surrounding countryside. As a result, the VRS warned the UN peacekeeping units in Srebrenica that Bosnian Serb forces would retaliate against the town's civilian population if Bosniak forces continued attacking Serb villages. The situation in Srebrenica subsequently worsened, with the refugees and townspeople running out of food and water. Despite this, the VRS only occasionally permitted humanitarian aid to the besieged town. In one instance, the VRS permitted the evacuation of about 5,000 Bosniak women and children from Srebrenica. During these evacuations, six children were crushed to death while clambering to board a bus destined for Tuzla. Afterwards, the VRS made an offer that would allow the UN to send in any number of trucks and buses into the enclave to evacuate its Bosniak population. However, this offer was rejected by many in the United Nations, the United States and the Bosnian government, who claimed that arranging an evacuation would \\"assist the process of ethnic cleansing.\\" In 1994, the Canadian peacekeeping battalion (CANBAT) in Srebrenica was replaced by a battalion of Dutch peacekeepers (DUTCHBAT). With the VRS outnumbered and overextended countrywide in the winter of 1994, Mladiƒá reasoned that it would be necessary to consolidate Bosnian Serb forces by eliminating one or more of the UN \\"safe areas\\" and the ARBiH garrisons located within them. Although attacking them would violate UN resolutions, Mladiƒá believed that international forces would not confront the VRS as long as UNPROFOR units were vulnerable to suffering heavy casualties and hostage takings. A subsequent hostage crisis in which UN personnel were seized and used as human shields to prevent NATO airstrikes destroyed the credibility of UN deterrence in Bihaƒá and Sarajevo. Mladiƒá then turned his attention to Srebrenica, Gora≈æde and ≈Ωepa, whose seizure would release considerable VRS forces for redeployment against an expected Croatian Army‚ÄìARBiH offensive in western Bosnia, while strengthening the Bosnian Serb claim to the entire Drina valley in case of a future peace settlement. Due their location, Srebrenica and ≈Ωepa were the most vulnerable of the UN \\"safe areas\\" in Bosnia, in stark contrast to Gora≈æde, where UN forces had resisted the VRS before being enforced by the ARBiH. Bosniak raids from the town intensified in the beginning of 1995, with Oriƒá's forces being ordered by the ARBiH to \\"reconnoiter, disrupt, divert and demoralize\\" VRS soldiers, who subsequently retaliated with counterattacks of their own. In March 1995, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá, President of the Republika Srpska, issued Directive 7, setting out the long term strategy for VRS forces surrounding Srebrenica and ≈Ωepa. The aim of the VRS was to be to \\"complete the physical separation of Srebrenica from ≈Ωepa as soon as possible, preventing even communication between individuals in the two enclaves. By planned and well thought out combat operations, create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of Srebrenica.\\" During this time, Oriƒá ordered the murder of many political opponents and profited from smuggling supplies on the black market. At night, his men would break out from the enclave and participate in illicit trade with Bosnian Serb villagers and would also often loot the Serb countryside. In the last two weeks of June, a VRS unit was ambushed twenty kilometers northwest of the Srebrenica enclave. By this time Oriƒá had already fled to the Bosniak-held town of Tuzla, ostensibly to participate in a \\"command training\\" exercise. He was replaced by his deputy, Major Ramiz Beƒáiroviƒá, who had been seriously injured in a helicopter crash two months earlier and was barely able to walk. Oriƒá's departure effectively left Srebrenica without effective leadership. Despite this, ARBiH headquarters ordered another attack against Bosnian Serb units on the Sarajevo-Zvornik road for the evening of 25‚Äì26 June. With a force of 150 men, Bosniak forces inflicted forty casualties VRS casualties and seized weapons, radios and livestock. Mladiƒá then contacted the UN headquarters in Sarajevo and indicated that he would no longer tolerate Bosniak incursions into the Bosnian Serb countryside. Bosnian Serb forces retaliated by shelling Srebrenica, prompting the Bosniaks to respond that the VRS was again shelling a UN safe area.  Fall of Srebrenica  = Operation Krivaja '95 = Operation Krivaja '95 (, ) was the codename of a military operation launched by the VRS against formations of the ARBIH in the UN enclave of Srebrenica. Launched on 6 July 1995, the operation ended the three-year-long siege of the town and was followed by the Srebrenica massacre, which has been ruled a crime of genocide by international courts of law. In late-June 1995, Ratko Mladiƒá made the decision to launch an attack on Srebrenica, which evidence indicates was always part of his long-term strategy. However, the Serbs did not expect Srebrenica to be an easy conquest. With 100 members of the Greek Volunteer Guard, together with 2,000‚Äì3,000 reinforcements and 200‚Äì300 members of the Serb Volunteer Guard, the Bosnian Serbs could hardly muster 4,000‚Äì5,000 men for the offensives against Srebrenica and ≈Ωepa. Of these, it was estimated that only 2,000 would take part in the thrust to capture Srebrenica in July 1995. The Bosniaks, not as well-armed as their opponents, had a military force of 6,000 men within the town, about one-third or one-half of whom were armed. 1,500 of these were professional soldiers and 1,500 were armed militiamen. Also in the town were the 570 lightly-armed peacekeepers of the Dutch battalion (DUTCHBAT). Potoƒçari. On 2 July, Major General Milenko ≈Ωivanoviƒá, then commander of the Drina Corps of the VRS, signed two orders laying out the plans for an attack on the UN protected area at Srebrenica codenamed Krivaja '95. The objective of the operation was for the VRS to attack the enclave, and effectively eliminate it. Alongside police and paramilitary units from both the Republika Srpska and Yugoslavia, as well as Greek and Russian volunteers, the VRS began attacking various points at the southern edge of the Srebrenica enclave on 6 July. The forces of the VRS, numbering 1,500 in the initial stages of the attack, then shelled a series of Dutch observation posts in the southern portion of the enclave, forcing the Dutch peacekeepers stationed there to flee. On the other hand, the few thousand remaining Bosniak soldiers of Srebrenica offered little resistance as their best-trained units had already abandoned the town. To make matters worse, Dutch peacekeepers had confiscated their weapons. When the Bosniaks demanded that their weapons be returned to them, the Dutch refused. As a result, Bosniak troops attempted to block the Dutch withdrawal in the face of the Bosnian Serb onslaught and more than 100 Dutch soldiers were taken hostage by the Bosniaks in a desperate attempt to stop them from leaving. Subsequently, a Dutch peacekeeper was killed after a hand grenade was thrown at his APC by a Bosniak soldier. The Dutch then demanded that NATO bomb Serb positions around the town, but their requests were ignored. With virtually no Bosniak resistance, the VRS relentlessly pounded Srebrenica with artillery on 9 and 10 July. On 11 July, the VRS entered the town. As it did, Mladiƒá had about thirty Dutch soldiers taken hostage. About 3,000-4,000 Bosniak civilians then fled to the UN compound in Potoƒçari where all men between fourteen and seventy were segregated by the VRS, the great bulk of which were trucked to neighboring Serb-held Bratunac. DutchBat personnel who attempted to follow them were seized by the VRS, together with their UN vehicles and some uniforms, weapons and other equipment. Whereas Mladiƒá had expected the ARBiH 28th Division to regroup near Potoƒçari, the men of this division chose instead to flee to Bosnian-held territory. On 12 July the Serbs learned that the majority of the town's men had indeed fled the enclave, with 700‚Äì900 fleeing east to Serbia, 300‚Äì850 fleeing south to ≈Ωepa, and 10,000‚Äì15,000 fleeing north to Tuzla. Of these 10,000‚Äì15,000, approximately 6,000 were fleeing Bosniak soldiers, of whom 1,000‚Äì1,500 were armed. By the time the VRS had been redeployed, about 3,000 soldiers of the column's better-armed vanguard had successfully escaped to Tuzla. The 9,000‚Äì12,000 Bosniaks who remained were encircled by VRS units and attacked by artillery, armor and small arms fire. The relatively few who survived the experience recounted how many panic-stricken Bosniak men committed suicide, killed each other in the dark, or drowned while attempting to cross the Jadar river, but by far the greatest portion of the men surrendered, some unwittingly to VRS soldiers equipped with stolen UN vehicles, helmets and uniforms. At midday on 11 July, Dutch NATO planes arrived from Italy and struck a Bosnian Serb tank, before being forced to cease operations after General Mladiƒá threatened to \\"destroy\\" both the Dutch soldiers and the Bosniak population of Srebrenica unless airstrikes were called off. That afternoon, Mladiƒá, accompanied by General ≈Ωivanoviƒá (then Commander of the Drina Corps), General Krstiƒá (then Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff of the Drina Corps) and other Bosnian Serb officers, took a triumphant walk through the deserted streets of the town of Srebrenica. The moment was captured on film by Serbian journalist Zoran Petroviƒá Piroƒáanac. Mladiƒá posed for television cameras, before declaring that Srebrenica had been \\"returned forever to the Serbs.\\" Later, Thom Karremans, the commander of the Dutch troops in the town, drank a toast with Mladiƒá which was filmed for Serb television. Off-camera, however, Mladiƒá warned Karremans that the UN compound in Potoƒçari, where thousands of Bosniak refugees had gathered, would be shelled by the VRS if NATO planes reappeared.  Aftermath  = Srebrenica massacre = Potocari, Bosnia and Herzegovina. July 2007. On 12 July, buses began arriving to take Bosniak women and children to Bosniak-held territory while Dutch troops helped Bosnian Serb forces in separating all men from the ages of 15 to 65. Some of the men were killed or beaten on the spot, while women were raped. The fall of the town was followed by a massacre of prisoners taken by the VRS forces and civilian refugees who had been handed over to the VRS by Dutchbat troops after they had sought shelter on the Dutchbat base at Potoƒçari. The ICTY Trial Chamber was satisfied that the total number executed was likely to have been within the range of 7,000 to 8,000. The bodies were disposed of in unmarked mass graves which were subsequently reopened and the contents mingled and relocated. The killings and their concealment, carried out in an organised and systematic manner, were subsequently confirmed by the ICTY to have been a crime of genocide pursuant to the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. For example, on 14 July 1995, prisoners from Bratunac were bussed northward to a school in the village of Pilica, north of Zvornik. As at other detention facilities, there was no food or water and several men died in the school gym from heat and dehydration. The men were held at the Pilica school for two nights. On 16 July 1995, following a now familiar pattern, the men were called out of the school and loaded onto buses with their hands tied behind their backs. They were then driven to the Branjevo Military Farm, where groups of 10 were lined up and shot systematically. One of the survivors recalled: Dra≈æen Erdemoviƒá ‚Äì who confessed to killing at least 70 Bosniaks ‚Äì was a member of the VRS 10th Sabotage Detachment (a Main Staff subordinate unit) and participated in the mass execution. Erdemoviƒá appeared as a prosecution witness and testified: \\"The men in front of us were ordered to turn their backs. When those men turned their backs to us, we shot at them. We were given orders to shoot.\\" Erdemoviƒá said that all but one of the victims wore civilian clothes and that, except for one person who tried to escape, they offered no resistance before being shot. Sometimes the executioners were particularly cruel. When some of the soldiers recognised acquaintances from Srebrenica, they beat and humiliated them before killing them. Erdemoviƒá had to persuade his fellow soldiers to stop using a machine gun for the killings; while it mortally wounded the prisoners it did not cause death immediately and prolonged their suffering. Between 1,000 and 1,200 men were killed in the course of that day at this execution site. Aerial photographs, taken on 17 July 1995, of an area around the Branjevo Military Farm, show a large number of bodies lying in the field near the farm, as well as traces of the excavator that collected the bodies from the field. Erdemoviƒá testified that, at around 15:00 hours on 16 July 1995, after he and his fellow soldiers from the 10th Sabotage Detachment had finished executing the prisoners at the Branjevo Military Farm, they were told that there was a group of 500 Bosniak prisoners from Srebrenica trying to break out of a nearby Dom Kultura club. Erdemoviƒá and the other members of his unit refused to carry out any more killings. They were then told to attend a meeting with a Lieutenant Colonel at a caf√© in Pilica. Erdemoviƒá and his fellow-soldiers travelled to the caf√© as requested and, as they waited, they could hear shots and grenades being detonated. The sounds lasted for approximately 15‚Äì20 minutes after which a soldier from Bratunac entered the caf√© to inform those present that \\"everything was over\\". There were no survivors to explain exactly what had happened in the Dom Kultura. Over a year later, it was still possible to find physical evidence of this atrocity. As in Kravica, many traces of blood, hair and body tissue were found in the building, with cartridges and shells littered throughout the two storeys. It could also be established that explosives and machine guns had been used. Human remains and personal possessions were found under the stage, where blood had dripped down through the floorboards. ƒåanƒçari Road 12 was the site of the re-interment of at least 174 bodies, moved here from the mass grave at the Branjevo Military Farm. Only 43 were complete sets of remains, most of which established that death had taken place as there result of rifle fire. Of the 313 various body parts found, 145 displayed gunshot wounds of a severity likely to prove fatal. = Casualties = After the Bosnian War, the Bosnian Book of the Dead documented 9,377 violent deaths amongst combatants and civilians of all ethnicities that occurred in the Srebrenica municipality from 1992 to 1995. The RDC established that at least 5,233 Bosnian-Muslim civilians were killed in Srebrenica during the war. Most estimates put the number of Bosniak men and boys killed in the July 1995 massacre at 7,000‚Äì8,000; the list of Bosniaks killed during this period compiled by the Bosnian Federal Commission of Missing Persons contains 8,373 names. In 2003, Serbs comprised 95 percent of the population of the Srebrenica municipality. = Indictments and trials = At his trial, VRS General Radislav Krstiƒá was found by the ICTY to have been the person primarily directing Krivaja '95 from 6 July onward, at least until the arrival of Ratko Mladiƒá on 9 July. The ICTY determined that the initial objective of Krivaja '95 had been to \\"reduce the United Nations-protected safe area of Srebrenica to its urban core\\" as a step towards \\"the larger VRS goal of plunging the Bosniak population into a humanitarian crisis and, ultimately, eliminating the enclave\\", and that after the surrounding area had fallen the VRS forces were then ordered to take the town itself. The ICTY found Krstiƒá guilty of participating in two criminal plans, initially to ethnically cleanse the Srebrenica enclave of all Bosniak civilians and later to kill the military-aged men of Srebrenica. He was found guilty of murder, persecutions and aiding and abetting genocide. On 31 May 2007, Zdravko Tolimir, a long-time fugitive and a former general in the VRS indicted by the Prosecutor of the ICTY on genocide charges relating to Srebrenica was arrested. On 12 December 2012, Tolimir was convicted of genocide and sentenced to life imprisonment. Ratko Mladiƒá during the trial at the Hague Tribunal In May 2011, VRS General Ratko Mladiƒá was arrested in a village in northern Serbia by three special units of the Serbian security forces. The next year, his trial began before the ICTY in The Hague on charges relating to his participation as VRS commander in the criminal conspiracy to perpetrate the Srebrenica genocide. In 2010, seven high level VRS commanders were convicted of various crimes related to the genocide in Srebrenica including, Ljubi≈°a Beara, and Vujadin Popovic who were found guilty of Conspiracy to commit, and Committing Genocide. Dragan Nikolic, was found guilty of Aiding and Abbetting Genocide. Former Presideny of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic was also charged with genocide in a number of Bosnian municipalities including Srebrenica. Commander Naser Oriƒá, pictured here in 2007, led Bosniak forces in the enclave of Srebrenica from 1992 to 1995 In 2016, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá was found guilty by the ICTY for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in the Srebrenica enclave, and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Momir Nikoliƒá, who served as Assistant Chief of Security and Intelligence for the Bratunac Brigade, Drina Corp of the VRS, pleaded guilty for crimes against humanity in front of the ICTY and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Together with another former VRS soldier who pleaded guilty, Dra≈æen Erdemoviƒá, he testified in front of the ICTY against Karad≈æiƒá, Mladiƒá and Beara, providing valuable information about the execution and timeline of the massacre. Finally, on 22 November 2017, general Ratko Mladiƒá was sentenced to a life in prison. Bosniak commander Naser Oriƒá was arrested by SFOR in April 2003, and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), who indicted him for the \\"murder and cruel treatment\\" of Bosnian Serb prisoners, as well as burning and plundering about fifty Serb villages from 1992 to 1995. In 2006, Oriƒá was found guilty of failing to prevent the mistreatment of VRS prisoners held in Srebrenica between September 1992 and March 1993. But the former Bosniak military commander was acquitted of all other charges, including direct involvement in the killings and responsibility for the \\"wanton destruction\\" of Serb homes and property as the ICTY could not establish that Oriƒá himself exercised sufficient control over the raids to justify convicting him of command responsibility for the atrocities. He was sentenced to two years in jail, but was freed immediately as he had already spent three years behind bars. Oriƒá's two-year conviction was also subsequently overturned in July 2008 by the appeals chamber which ruled that \\"the legal requirements to prove Oriƒá's criminal responsibility had not been met.\\"  Notes   References  ;Books      ;News articles   ;ICTY documents  * ;Other documents and sources Conflicts in 1995 Bosnian War Battles of the Bosnian War Military operations of the Bosnian War 1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina ","title":"Siege of Srebrenica"},{"id":"20691052","text":"Dala is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Sudan, and played especially by the Baggara tribes. The game is also called Herding the Cows (or Herding the Bulls). It is an alignment game with captures similar to that of the game Dara. Players first drop their pieces onto the board, and then move them (herding the cows) orthogonally in an attempt to form 3 in-a-rows which allows a player to capture any of their opponent's piece on the board.  Goal  The player who reduces their opponent's number of pieces to two is the winner. The opponent can no longer form a 3-in-a-row with two pieces or fewer.  Equipment  A 6x6 square board is used. Each player has a set of 12 pieces of which one set is black, and the other is white. Traditionally, the board was played on a raised soft mud, and the lines of the board were drawn onto it and marked by holes called \\"Nugar\\". Each player had 12 sharpened sticks that would be placed into the holes during play. To differentiate the sticks, the bark was removed on one set of the sticks, while the other set would retain its bark.  Game play  Players decide who will play the black and white pieces, and who will start first. A 3 in-a-row is defined as exactly three pieces of the same color adjacent to one another in an orthogonal direction. The player who forms the 3 in-a-row is allowed to capture one of their opponent's piece from anywhere on the board. This is known as a \\"ta'na\\". 4 in- a-rows or more are allowed to be created, but do not allow the player forming it to capture a piece from their opponent. The 3 in-a-row must be in an orthogonal direction, and therefore, diagonal 3 in-a-rows do not count also. Two or more 3 in-a-rows can be formed in a single move by a player, however, it may only allow that player to capture a single piece from their opponent. No source clearly clarifies this matter. The Drop Phase is the first stage of the game. Players alternate their turns placing each of their 12 pieces, one piece per turn, onto the board. However, the four central squares of the board must first be filled. Afterwards, players may place their pieces on any vacant square on the board. During the Drop Phase, players can form 3 in-a-rows which allows for that player to capture an enemy piece from anywhere on the board. After each player has dropped their 12 pieces, the Movement Phase begins. Players alternate their turns moving one piece orthogonally onto a vacant adjacent square. The piece can form a 3 in-a-row by either moving onto a row or column of two adjacent pieces of its color, or leaving a row or column of four adjacent pieces of its color and thus leaving behind three adjacent pieces in-a-row.

Variety; October 15, 1941, p. 8. The film was released by United Artists. Against a World War II backdrop, Sundown's adventure story, set in British East Africa, was well-received by critics, earning three Academy Award nominations, but it was a failure at the box office.Film review: 'Sundown'. Harrison's Reports, October 25, 1941, p. 171. Plot An aircraft lands in Kenya near Rhino Rock, and Zia (Gene Tierney), disembarks and is met by a caravan, her caravan. In Manieka, British East Africa, Bill Crawford (Bruce Cabot), District Commissioner, contacts the governor at Nairobi, requesting a month-long furlough to study the Senshi, a local tribe. His colleague, Lt. Roddy Turner (Reginald Gardiner), sends a message to the governor to cancel the furlough as the Senshi are becoming hostile. Two aircraft land at Manieka, bringing both rifles and Major Coombes (George Sanders), the Governor's agent. Coombes tells Crawford that he is taking control of the outpost. When he finds Pallini (Joseph Calleia), officially an Italian prisoner of war, but unofficially the chef, Coombes wants Pollini put into restraints. He then asks Crawford why he wants a furlough, saying that someone is smuggling rifles to the Senshi. Dutch engineer Jan Kuypens (Carl Esmond), working with the Italian government, is making a mineral survey of the area. Coombes suggests that Kuypens instead file his report with the British; he agrees. A local trader named Abdi Hammud (Marc Lawrence) sets up an ambush of the British troops, but Crawford and his men are able to stop the attack. Zia, the daughter of the late Abu Kalli, who now runs the family network of trading posts in East Africa, arrives at the outpost. Pallini has known Zia for many years, and on Pallini's birthday, the outpost decides to throw him a party. The men make sure they invite Zia, but when she arrives, she must sit at a segregated table because by native custom she is considered a half-breed. Crawford sits with her and discovers that she is African. The locals believe that one of the six white men will die that night. But there are only five of them at the party. When the white hunter, Dewey (Harry Carey), arrives, everyone else suddenly disappears. Two locals shoot at Crawford, but they miss, while Zia is grazed by a bullet. One of the attackers is killed and turns out to be the trader Hammud, responsible for the earlier ambush. The suspicious Coombes orders Zia to leave the outpost, despite her slight wound. Kuypens confronts Zia in her quarters, who quickly recognizes his German accent. Kuypens is a Nazi agent who is bringing in rifles to arm the Senshi. She agrees to go with him, but passes a warning message to Pallini to give to Crawford. Before Pallini is able to deliver it, Kuypens kills him. Pallini becomes the one (of the six) fated to die that night. The men find his body and Crawford decides to pursue Kuypens. Crawford confers with Dewey on where Kuypens will go. His rock samples, being volcanic, lead Crawford and Dewey to a geographic area they know. Their armed reinforcements follow shortly behind. Zia is taken to a large cave complex where the rifles are being prepared. Crawford and Dewey find one of the arms stores and manage to blow up some rifles and ammunition. They also find the large cave complex; Dewey goes back to bring up their reinforcements. Kuypens informs Zia that he knows that she is actually the daughter of Graham Fletcher, who, along with her mother, died when Zia was just two years old. Abu Kalli adopted her and raised her as an Arab. Crawford is captured, and is placed in a large cell with Zia, who tells him that the Senshi will attack Marieka the following day. Crawford suspects that she is working with Kuypens, but she finally convinces him that he is wrong. The two escape by tricking their guards, but a shoot-out between them, Kuypens, and the guards ends with Zia being captured. Crawford plays dead, then overpowers the guard sent to finish him off. Coombes and Dewey arrive with the British reinforcements, foiling the attack on Marieka. During the battle, Coombes is able to shoot Kuypens, but not before the Nazi agent fatally wounds him. Later in London, Zia and Crawford are married before attending a large memorial service for Major Coombes. Afterward, they make their plans to return to Africa.

He led the Nandi resistance against British colonial rule. Early life Samoei was born to Kimnyole Arap Turukat at Samitu in Aldai. He was the last of four sons and belonged to the Kaplelach age-set. Even though he was the youngest, he was reportedly close to his father and displayed the greatest ability in understanding prophetic signs. Kimnyole, who is said to have predicted his death, reportedly summoned his four sons as he saw his time approach and asked them to consult traditional brews in a pot. Samoei upon gazing into the pot, drew his sword in protest having perceived the coming of the Europeans. Kimnyole sensed danger in his sons bravery and out of concern for his safety, sent Koitalel's three siblings to live among the Kipsigis while Samoei was asked to go and live among the Tugen.The Standard, October 19, 2013; Too., T., Koitalel Samoei: Nandi legend who fought colonialists.

Factions formed around the two aspirants and minor skirmishes took place between their supporters but this did not extend to full scale war.

Assassination To end the resistance, the British Col. Richard Meinertzhagen invited Koitalel to negotiate a truce. The peace meeting was to be held at 11:00AM on October 19, 1905. Suspecting that he would be killed as his father Kimnyole had feared, Samoei instructed the British Colonel to come with five companions to meet him at Ketbarak (present day Nandi Bears Club). Samoei was to come with five foretellers. Contrary to the agreement, Meinhertzhagen marched from the fort at Kaptumo with 80 armed men, 75 of whom hid near the venue of the meeting. It is reported that when Koitalel stretched his hand to shake Meinhertzhagen's, the British Colonel murdered him with a shot at point blank range.

The building is a landmark of the Island, the spire being visible from many places around the Isle of Wight - and indeed from the mainland - projecting beyond the skyline. All Saints' is sometimes referred to as the \\"Cathedral of the Island\\" It is a Grade II* ecclesiastical listed building. Architecture The church was built between 1868 and 1872 by the architect George Gilbert Scott.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner The spire was an addition of 1881/82. The spire is climbed early on the Feast of the Ascension to sing an Ascension hymn. All Saints' is listed as a 'large' church in ornate Second Pointed style, constructed of stone-rubble with ashlar dressings. There are six bay- pointed arcades with naturalistic capitals. The chancel walls were painted by Clayton and Bell. The vestry - now the choir song school - was added by C Pemberton-Leach in 1891. There are two side chapels: The Warrior Chapel in the north aisle - which is a memorial chapel \\\\- and The Chapel of The Good Shepherd in the south aisle, which was the original sacristy. The pulpit, reredos and font are all typical Scott features, The pulpit is made of Derbyshire alabaster on polished marble columns, and appeared in The Great Exhibition of 1851, winning 1st prize in its class. The tower contains a ring of eight bells cast by Messrs Taylor and Co of Loughborough in 1866. There are some fine examples of stained glass windows but these are mostly confined to the north aisle and sanctuary areas, the other windows having been destroyed by enemy action during the Second World War.

Jim Lee, the seventh Image founder, who is now affiliated with DC Comics, is contributing covers to the series.

Whilce Portacio‚Äîwhose first Image Comics series Wetworks is now owned by DC Comics via their buyout of Wildstorm‚Äîcreated a new character for the series, Baxter Montgomery, code- named Fortress. The villain has been revealed as the original Spawn, Al Simmons, now known as Omega Spawn. Plot The story begins with Fortress appearing unsure of his new powers and still adjusting to them. This leads to a run-in with Savage Dragon, who assumes the worst about Fortress, and Fortress accidentally knocks Dragon to the ground. Before the altercation can continue, they both run into Doc Seismic, and a fight ensues, resulting in Fortress finally taking down Seismic after absorbing all his energy. Dragon then thanks Fortress for his help, but after trying to bring him in, Fortress flies off unable to handle the amount of energy he absorbed. He then crashes down onto the ground and passes out after having a vision of all the Image Comics characters standing together.Image United #0 Issue #1 begins with Fortress continuing to have his vision of the Image Universe characters. In said vision, they are facing an evil they cannot possibly stand against and they are all systematically taken down. Fortress snaps out of it to find himself on a roof in Chicago, before he can get his bearings, he sees Overt- Kill down in the street causing mass destruction while Youngblood arrive on the scene to face down Overt-Kill. Dragon sees the commotion and joins the fray, teaming with Youngblood to stop Overt-Kill. Meanwhile, at Cyberforce HQ, Cyberforce are seeing violent incidents rising all over the country. Unsure of where to assist first, they conclude that all these incidents arising at the same time can be no coincidence and there must be a larger force at work. At that point Velocity runs in and informs them of big mess in downtown New York City, and they decide to go there first. Back in Chicago, Dragon and Youngblood are still fighting against Overt-Kill and not having much success. Fortress, tired of standing by, joins the fray, just in time for Diehards' current body to be destroy by Overt-Kill. He uploads himself into a new body, and as he departs Youngblood HQ, Troll informs him that a new recruit is waiting before he runs out. Fortress, Shaft, Badrock and Dragon continue to engage Overt-Kill in Chicago. At Youngblood HQ, Eddie Collins, Shadowhawk, is waiting to audition for the team with his father. Troll runs in and informs him Shaft is out in the field, and that he will be handling the final evaluation. Eddie suits up and says that he is ready. Back in Chicago, Badrock gets the upper hand on Overt-Kill and destroys his body. Overt-Kill launches his head off, but Shaft grounds him before he can escape. Fortress sees the battle is over, but cannot help but feel that worse things are coming and he must gather more forces. Diehard returns and takes Vogue to a hospital to be treated for her wounds. Dragon starts to leave but Fortress stops him by slamming him into a wall and starts screaming that the world needs them and terrible danger is coming. Dragon punches him down unsure of what Fortress is talking about, Shaft steps in and says that Youngblood will take him into custody. Back at Youngblood HQ, Shadowhawk has apparently passed all evaluations with flying colors and Troll tells him that he's as good as in. Cougar runs by and tells Troll that Girth, Quantum and Crypt are all active in different locations and that Youngblood is splitting into three teams to assist. Troll tells Shadowhawk that while he must stay to coordinate the effort, they could use Shadowhawk in the field. Shadowhawk agrees with almost no hesitation. In New York City, Jim Downing is sitting in a room when a voice tells him to rise, and that he is a piece of a plan that has already been set into motion. Jim is unsure of who it is and transforms into Spawn, demanding to know who it is and what they want. Al Simmons then reveals himself as the Omega Spawn, and says that he wants it all, and that Jim Downing is going to help him get it. Back in Chicago, Dragon arrives back home to find Malcolm watching TV and Angel attempting to help with the chaos. Dragon forbids her before he is called in by the Police Department. His only comment being, \\"What in the world is going on...?\\" At Youngblood HQ, Shaft goes to visit Fortress in his cell, once there Shaft demands to know what he was going on about to Dragon earlier. Fortress says he only knows bits, but that it's going to get worse, and if they do not gather everyone against the coming threat, they will all die.Image United #1 In New York, Jim Downing comes face to face with Al Simmons, where Al Simmons makes all his plans clear to end the world, and he asks Jim to help him. Jim refuses and engages Omega Spawn in a battle, where Al easily gains the upper hand. Omega Spawn makes it very clear that he is superior, and informs Jim that he will never truly know what he was a part of, and he will never have the answers his sought, as he attempts to deliver a final blow Jim teleports himself to a hospital. He attempts to warn them of the coming threat, but is too weak. He is taken into care by Ann Stevens. Coincidentally enough this is also the hospital Diehard brought Vogue too after their fight with Overt-Kill. Vogue appears to be sleeping or passed out, and as Diehard attempts to tell her how he feels about her, the hospital is attacked. Diehard rushes to get Vogue to safety, as Ann changes into Mighty Man to assist against the attack. Shaft continues to speak with Fortress, with Fortress explaining everything, only for Shaft to doubt his story. Shaft rushes off to assist in the fights as Fortress yells that they need all the help they can get. In New York Sara Pezzini sees Youngblood and Shadowhawk engaged in a fight with more villains, and rushes in to assist with the Witchblade. In Chicago SuperPatriot is attempting to fight off even more villains as Dragon enters the fray. After defeating them, they are called in to assist at the hospital where Mighty Man and Diehard are still engaged in battle. Dragon and SuperPatriot enter the fray to assist, but are interrupted by the timely intervention of Spawn who dispatches the villains with ease as the other heroes assist in evacuating the Hospital. Over in Hartford, Cyberforce is still engaged in battle, which is ended due to the intervention of apparently newcomer, Barricade, who apparently also got his powers from Cyberdata. Cyberforce decides to keep Barricade with them, and check in with Youngblood to see if they have a better understanding of what is going on. Flashes are shown of Seattle, Huntington, St. Louis. Orlando, Detroit and Los Angeles, showing The Darkness amongst others engaged in battle with multiple villains who all appear to be getting the upper hand. In Chicago, Spawn is explaining the situation to Diehard and Dragon, and reveals Al Simmons, the Omega Spawn as the villain to them. At that moment, Youngblood arrives to pick up Diehard, who takes Dragon and Spawn with him for any help and information they can provide. Back at Youngblood HQ, Fortress continually tells himself that it's too late. The New York Youngblood team has defeated their villains and Shadowhawk is telling his dad that is fine. Shaft and his father are at the HQ, and await their return. In New York a massive group of villains has assembled, poised to destroy New York City, under the orders of the Omega Spawn. They run towards the Statue of Liberty in a group attack.Image United #2 Reception The first issue selling just over 42,000 copies,\\"November 2009 Comic Book Sales Figures\\". The Comics Chronicles.

Opened in 1845, consecrated the following year and parished in 1863, it became the rapidly growing town's first parish church. A \\"fine, gracious\\" and \\"imposing\\" structure with a spire, it is visible for miles as a landmark at the northern end of the island, along with nearby All Saints Church. The building has been used as a community centre since it closed for worship in 2014. Historic England has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. The town of Ryde, which developed in the late 18th and early 19th century, was originally in the large parish of Newchurch, whose parish church was a long way to the south. Private chapels were built in Ryde, but it was only in 1839 that the new vicar of Newchurch set up a committee to found a conventional parish church in the town. Rapid population growth led to the construction of a \\"large and lofty\\" stone church capable of holding 800 worshippers. It was designed in the Early English Gothic Revival style by one of the island's most prolific architects, Ryde resident Thomas Hellyer. History The ancient parish of Newchurch was vast: it stretched from the north to the south coast of the Isle of Wight and was the largest on the eastern half of the island (the East Medine). The village itself is small and well inland, but the area around the manor of Ryde, on the north coast of the island opposite Portsmouth, developed rapidly as a resort and high-class residential area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. All Saints, the parish church of Newchurch, was south of the developing town, so two private proprietary chapels were built in Ryde to provide some accommodation for Anglican worshippers: St Thomas's in 1719 (rebuilt in 1827) and St James's (1827‚Äì29). St Thomas's and St James's were not parish churches‚ÄîSt Thomas's was a chapel of ease to Newchurch and the vicar there was responsible for services, while St James's was unconsecrated and sat outside the parochial system‚Äî so the town was still formally served by All Saints at Newchurch. In 1839, its new vicar, Rev. W. Spencer Phillips, started a project to build a conventional parish church in Ryde, whose population had grown from 1,600 to more than 5,800 in 30 years. He appointed a fundraising committee, and by 1841 ¬£6,806 had been raised through grants and voluntary contributions. Of this, ¬£1,500 came from the Lind family, who also donated the site on Dover Street southeast of the town centre. (Originally surrounded by fields, the area around the church became built up with villas after 1850.) The foundation stone was laid on 16 October 1841 in the presence of the Bishop of Winchester by Elizabeth Lydia Lind, widow of the late John Lind, The church was designed by the local architect Thomas Hellyer and built by Langdon and Denham, a local construction firm. Work was delayed for a year by financial problems, and another local builder Thomas Dashwood had to finish the project. The tall spire is \\"a prominent landmark when approaching Ryde from The Solent\\". Most construction work took place between 1844 and 1846, and the building was still unfinished when it was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester, Rt. Revd. Charles Sumner on 28 October 1845: the transepts and spire had yet to be added. The following year, by Order in Council, a district called The Chapelry District of the Holy Trinity, Ryde was assigned to the new church. Although it was still part of Newchurch parish, Holy Trinity Church was now ecclesiastically responsible for a large part of Ryde town and was licensed for burials, baptisms and the solemnisation of marriages. A separate parish was created for the church in 1863. At this point Holy Trinity became Ryde's first Church of England parish church. The parish was the first to be created from the territory of Newchurch; subsequently, separate parishes were also formed for Ashey, Ventnor and Wroxall. The first service was held on the day of consecration, 28 October 1845; at that time, 500 of the 800 sittings were free and 300 were subject to pew rents, although all seats were later made free. Rev. Arthur John Wade, , the first incumbent, was responsible for making the return for the 1851 United Kingdom census, which included for the first time a census of religion. In response to the question about the endowment of the living and other sources of income, he wrote \\"I will not answer these inquiries\\"; and added in the remarks section that the question \\"is quite inquisitive and impertinent ... [and] the Act does not require it, as it is officially but most incorrectly affirmed on [this document]: it is partial and unfair\\". The spire was added to the tower in 1846. Two years later the south transept was built, and the church took on its final appearance in 1860 when a north transept was added. This work cost ¬£1,300. An organ chamber was added inside in 1871 at a cost of ¬£286, also designed by a local architect (Francis Newman). The spire was damaged in a storm in 1900, and its distinctive corner pinnacles had to be renewed at a cost of ¬£430; and during repair work in 1963, they were found to be no longer structurally safe and were removed. Replicas were installed five years later as part of a programme of work for which ¬£5,000 was raised. A small bell was hung in the tower in 1846. On 31 October 1852 it suddenly cracked without warning while being rung during a service. Rev. Arthur Wade, who belonged to the Isle of Wight Philosophical and Scientific Society, reported the events at a meeting the following day, noting that the crack had occurred \\"without any unusual violence taking place\\". This was then reported in the Isle of Wight Observer the following week. A letter appeared in the next edition of that newspaper, written by \\"The Cracked Bell of Trinity Church\\" of \\"The Belfry, Trinity Church, Ryde\\". It noted that the Society had been \\"mightily puzzled at\\" what had happened, and went on to say \\"please ... tell him ... I die of a broken heart, brought on by hearing myself outdone by the silvery tones from a neighbouring steeple. [...] I was never fit for my place; and ... I warn my successor [with my] expiring groans\\". A larger replacement bell was hung in 1854; it was moved to an \\"unusual position\\" below the spire in 1863, from the original bell-chamber in the tower. It was cast by George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. A community facility was created in the crypt in 1992. The Bishop of Portsmouth opened the Crypt Centre, which included a playroom, a refectory serving meals to the public, quiet space for reflection and a chapel. By the start of 2014 the number of regular worshippers had declined to 12, and the church closed for worship in January of that year. The remaining congregation moved to St John's Church in the Oakfield area of Ryde, but Holy Trinity Church has not been deconsecrated or declared redundant. Shortly after closure, a community group acquired the building and converted it into a community centre and events venue with the name \\"Aspire Ryde\\". It is a registered charity. The church was listed at Grade II on 24 October 1950. Such buildings are defined as \\"nationally important and of special interest\\". Architecture and fittings Thomas Hellyer, who was based in Ryde, was a prolific architect on the Isle of Wight. He designed many churches there and on the mainland, as well as other buildings, and his output has been described as \\"remarkable\\" and \\"very individualistic\\". Holy Trinity was the largest of his churches on the island, although it was not built fully to his original design: cost constraints meant that a small apse at the east end had to replace the large sanctuary he intended. Consideration was given after World War I to demolishing the apse and building the sanctuary as originally planned, as a war memorial, but this was not done. Holy Trinity Church is built of rag-stone dressed with ashlar; the roof is of slate. It is a cruciform building in the Early English Gothic Revival style, and has an aisled nave, chancel with an apse, north and south transepts, an entrance porch and a tall, prominent west tower with buttresses and a stone spire which rises to . Despite its size, it has a \\"delicate\\" form and elegant proportions matched with detailed architectural features, and has been called a \\"masterpiece\\" and the church's \\"crowning glory\\". It is one of two spires (along with that of All Saints) visible for miles around as landmarks of the town. The nave was restored in the 20th century, and screens were installed to separate it from the transepts. The aisles are demarcated by arcades of seven bays. A new altar was placed in the nave in the 1970s, but the original high altar remains. The windows are all lancets: narrow pairs in the aisles, a triple window in the tower, and single lights in the apse. A side chapel dedicated to St Martin, the patron saint of soldiers, is dedicated as a war memorial. The church contains stained glass windows by James Powell and Sons and Francis Skeat. The Powell glass was installed in the apse in 1913 to replace the original Victorian stained glass; Skeat's window is in the south chapel. The church clock was installed in April 1856 by Messrs. John Moore & Son, of Clerkenwell, London. Money was raised for this in 1855, and was installed that year at a cost of ¬£250. A further ¬£50 was spent the following year to install a second clock face on the Melville Street elevation of the tower.

The medal was established by the Dutch minister of defence, Wim van Eekelen, on 16 April 1987. The award was created by ministerial decree and is therefore a medal of the Netherlands Ministry of Defence and not a royal decoration. Defence ministries in Germany and the Czech Republic award similar decorations. This way chivalric orders keep their exclusivity. The ministerial decree requires four criteria for granting: *exceptional merits towards the armed forces which are incidentally of nature, *individual courage in life- threatening situations, *brave action in conflict situations in peace time, and *particular merits of Dutch and foreign civil and military authorities. In 2002, minister Benk Korthals added a fifth criteria for granting the medal: *exceptional activities for the Netherlands Armed forces. The award is granted in silver or gold. The medal is the sixth highest military decoration, after the Medal of Recognition, still being awarded for bravery. Design The medal has the shape of an old Dutch fortresses in the style that was introduced in the late 17th century by the Dutch fortress builder Menno van Coehoorn. The moat of the hexagonal fortresses has been reflected in blue enamel. In the middle of the depicted fortresses the symbols of three of the four branches of the Netherlands armed forces are displayed. These are the \\"climbing lion with sword and arrows\\" of the Royal Netherlands Army, the \\"anchor\\" of the Royal Netherlands Navy, and the \\"flying eagle\\" of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. The \\"burning grenade\\", the symbol of the fourth branch, the Royal Marechaussee, is absent. On the reverse side, the words KONINKRIJK DER NEDERLANDEN (English: Kingdom of the Netherlands) and MINISTER VAN DEFENSIE (English: Minister of Defence) are engraved in a circle. The medal is worn with a Nassau blue ribbon that has narrow red and white borders. Recipients may wear a ribbon bar on their uniform with the same composition (although on the ribbon bar of the golden medal has a golden palm branch added to it). American sergeant posthumously awarded On 12 September 2007 American sergeant Alexander van Aalten, (a descendant of Dutch ancestors) posthumously received the Decoration of Merit in gold. On 20 April 2007 Van Aalten, while in Afghanistan, volunteered to assist in the recovery of the body of a fallen Dutch Corporal Strik who had been killed by an improvised explosive device. Van Aalten was however himself killed by a land mine while attempting to retrieve the body of Strik. The golden Decoration of Merit was presented by Netherlands Minister of Defence Eimert van Middelkoop to the widow Shana van Aalten. The family of sergeant Van Aalten chose to have their son buried at Arlington National Cemetery. The presentation was at Arlington. Van Aalten was a member of the 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, an American airborne infantry division. The 82nd Airborne played a large role in the liberation of the Netherlands during the Second World War. During the Battle of Arnhem this division suffered heavy losses.

Harmondsworth: Penguin Books The church was consecrated on 18 July 1843 by Charles Richard Sumner the Bishop of Winchester. Successive enlargements to the building were made in following years as the local population grew, and on 3 December 1870 the enlarged church was re-consecrated. At the same time St John's became a parish church, until that time having been a chapel-of-ease in the parish of St Helens. A Lady chapel was added in 1914 in memory of the 7th Lord Calthorpe whose family lived at nearby Woodlands Vale, and were regular worshippers at the church. The chancel of the church was enlarged in 1954. The churchyard contains Commonwealth war graves of 13 service personnel from World War I and two from World War II.

In 1970 a church hall was added as an extension of the church building, the previous hall having been situated some distance away at the junction of St John's Hill and St John's Avenue. The church hall was refurbished in 2006 and was used for a number of years as The Park Centre, a community resource.

History The church was established by immigrants from England, Scotland, and Ulster. Makemie Memorial is generally regarded as being the first church in America to issue a call to a pastor, although others say that the call was actually issued through an Anglican, William Stevens, and that Rev. Francis Makemie (1658 ‚Äì 1708) actually first preached near Stevens' home parish, Coventry Parish further south in Rehoboth and established Rehobeth Presbyterian Church before this community. The original church building was a log structure located within a block of the Pocomoke River, which in 1683 was the main means of travel in the area given the vast wet-lands in Worcester County. The second structure was a frame building built on the current property on West Market Street, but it was built close to the center of the grave yard on the top of the little rise. That building burned and was replaced by a brick structure on the same spot. That building served for a number of years until it too was damaged by fire. In 1883, for the 200th anniversary of the organization of the church, it was resolved to build a Makemie Memorial Church in honor of Reverend Makemie. The present building designed by noted Philadelphia architect Isaac Pursell. It was started in 1887 and dedicated on June 29, 1890. Two other churches with similar names were established around the same time in Accomac, Virginia near where Rev. Makemie spent his final years and died. It is a Gothic Revival structure built of red brick with red sandstone trim. There are five beautiful memorial windows in the sanctuary and the vaulted ceiling is supported by hand-hewn, exposed wooded arches. It has two unequal tall towers. Maryland Senator Ephraim King Wilson II (1821 - 1891) is buried in the adjacent graveyard, as are former Governor John Walter Smith (1845-1925) and his wife.

One of its founding members was the poet Anna Haava. On 27 April 1923, the association began the publication of the monthly magazine Looming (\\"Creation\\"), which is one of the most important literary magazines in Estonia. In 1927 the association expanded to Tartu with the opening of a branch there. With the Soviet occupation of Estonia, the Estonian Writers Union was dissolved on 19 October 1940. The occupation authorities launched the Estonian Soviet Writers Union (Eesti N√µukogude Kirjanike Liit), on 8th or 9 October 1943 in Moscow. From 1958 it was called Writers Union of the Estonian SSR (Eesti NSV Kirjanike Liit) and was active until the end of the Soviet Union. During the German occupation of Estonia during World War II from 1941 to 1944, the original Estonian writers' association unofficially continued its work. In 1945, the International Estonian Writers Union (V√§lismaine Eesti Kirjanike Liit) was founded in Stockholm as the organization of exiled Estonian writers as a counter organization to the Soviet Estonia Writers Union. With the restoration of Estonian independence came the restoration of free expression and press freedom in Estonia, the association in Estonia was renamed Estonian Writers Union in 1991. The International Association merged with the Estonian Writers Union in October 2000. Currently, the Estonian Writers Union has 302 members (as of July 2007).

History A priory at St Helens was founded after the Norman Conquest by French Benedictine monks. The previous Saxon church was rebuilt in Norman style to serve both the local parish and the new priory. The church was dedicated to St Helena, and the nearby village in due course was known by this name. The tower was added in the 13th century during the reign of Henry III. The Benedictine priory was dissolved in 1414. Henry VI granted the priory lands to Eton College on its foundation in 1440, and the college owned it until 1799. Remains of the old church Plaques on the wall of St Helen's Old Church, Isle of Wight, describing the history of the structure and a local story about Nelson. The original church of St. Helens was in a bad state as far back as the 16th century, according to the presentment of George Oglander, the centoner of St. Helens. By the 18th century it had become so ruinous that a new church was built and the old church allowed to go to ruin. The tower, a 13th-century structure, was the only part left standing, and can still be seen today. The garden at the rear of the old Church tower was the parish burial ground from the time of the first church until the 18th century. The tower was bricked up and painted white as a seamark for Navy ships in 1719. Apocryphal tales suggest that stones from the old church were often taken to be used to clean the decks of sailing ships, giving rise to the practice known as ‚Äòholy- stoning‚Äô the decks. Cromwell's Commissioners reported in 1656 that the \\"Church is washed by the sea to the foundations; fearing the fall thereof there have been endeavours to secure it with great charge\\". They recommended that \\"it be taken down ere it fall and set up in the midst of the Parish.\\" It was sixty years before the new church was finally constructed safely inland.

He studied painting under N. S. Bendre and K.G. Subramanyan at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Maharaja Sayajirao University (M.S.U.), Baroda. Later he studied fresco and mural painting at Banasthali Vidyapith in Rajasthan, and in the early 1960s went on to study at the Academia di Belle Arti in Naples, Italy, as well the Pratt Institute in New York.Amrita Gupta Singh, Jyoti Bhatt: Parallels that Meet, Delhi Art Gallery, 2007 He was awarded the Padma Shri in 2019.  Biography  Bhatt moved from a cubist influence in his early work to a lighthearted and colorful Pop art that often drew its imagery from traditional Indian folk designs. Though Bhatt worked in a variety of mediums, including watercolors and oils, it is his printmaking that ultimately garnered him the most attention. In 1966 Bhatt returned to M.S.U. Baroda with a thorough knowledge of the intaglio process that he had gained at the Pratt Institute at Brooklyn in New York. It was partially Bhatt‚Äôs enthusiasm for intaglio that caused other artists such as Jeram Patel, Bhupen Khakhar and Gulammohammed Sheikh, to take up the same process. Bhatt, and his compatriots at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda, soon came to be known as \\"The Baroda School\\" of Indian art.Nilima Sheikh, Contemporary Art In Baroda, Tulika Publishers, 1997, Late in the 1960s, Bhatt was asked to take photographs of Gujarati folk art. Initially, this work was done for a seminar, but it soon became one of the artist‚Äôs passions to document traditional Indian craft and design work. The disappearing arts of rural Gujarat became a focus. Though Bhatt‚Äôs investigations into a village and tribal designs certainly influenced the motifs he used in his printmaking, Bhatt considers his documentary photographs to be an art form in themselves. His direct and simply composed photographs have become valued on their own merit.Amrita Jhaveri, A Guide to 101 Modern and Contemporary Indian Artists, India Book House, 2005 Throughout Bhatt‚Äôs long career as a teacher at the M.S.U. Faculty of Fine Arts, he has photographed the evolution of the university, the artistic activities of its faculty and students, and the architecturally significant buildings of Baroda. This huge body of work is perhaps the best assembled photographic documentation that pertains to \\"The Baroda School\\" of Indian art.Contemporary Art In Baroda, Tulika Publishers, 1997, It is Jyoti Bhatt‚Äôs prints, however, that are most associated with the artist. His etchings, intaglios, and screen prints have explored and re-explored a personal language of symbols that stem from Indian culture: the peacock, the parrot, the lotus, stylized Indian gods and goddesses, and unending variations on tribal and village designs. Recently he has explored digital printing and holography. His work is in numerous international collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, The Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C., The British Museum, London.Jyoti Bhatt: Parallels that Meet, Delhi Art Gallery, 2007 and the Museum of Art & Photography, Bangalore.  Personal life  Jyoti Bhatt met Jyotsna Bhatt, a potter, during her college years and they married later. They lived in Vadodara. They had a daughter, Jaii.

They are also often used on social networking pages. They are used as a mark of recognition or individualism, or to convey emotion, sentiment, or sometimes support for the illustrated concept. Sig tags are often personalised with the user's name by manipulation in a graphics software package. Sig tags are particularly popular with teenage computer users, and those who are socially active online. A sig tag is generally used below or at the end of a message, in contrast to an avatar, which is generally used next to the name of the poster on a forum.  Subjects and types  Popular subjects for sig tags are smileys, dollz, popular media figures from music, or TV shows, signs, cute animals, flowers and seasonal greetings. A small image with a generalised, non-customised slogan, used in the same way, is generally just known as a graphics tag, or a snag (because they are 'snagged' or downloaded quickly from an originating website). Sig tags are sometimes animated, using the .gif file format. Graphics software programs such as GNU Image Manipulation Program, Corel Paint Shop Pro and Adobe Photoshop are popular choices for the manipulation of digital images in creating sig tags.  Creation  A complex custom sig tag may consist of a number of amalgamated elements, which may be obtained online from popular sig tag community resources. These elements may include a mask (grid or background), a tube (image or figure on a transparent background), embellishments (additional decorative objects), and textures. These elements are normally used subject to copyright restrictions similar to those imposed on the use of dollz (dollz netiquette).  Community  The creation of sig tags is a widespread online hobby, regarded as a subsidiary of graphic art. It has been a long-lived phenomenon in internet terms, with little recorded history, and obscure, non-specified origins. This is largely due to its collaborative nature, and the disappearance of various websites important in the development of the hobby. The sig tag community is notable by its emphasis on sharing, mutual support, advice and appreciation. In fact, a conventional classing system (Novice, Moderate, Intermediate, Semi-Professional, Professional) is sometimes used to rank people on their skills in making sig tags. Many sig tag websites feature a busy forum and tutorials and users are encouraged to download images. Increasingly, these sites tend to be membership-based. More recently the tagging community has been dying. This may be due to the fact that tagging is often regarded as the lowest skilled form of computer graphics and the least profitable on many large forums.  Commercial sites  Some graphic artists have developed their skills or moved into the production of sig tags as a business. They generally offer user- licences, customisation of their sig tags, and purchaseable downloadable elements to be used by the user in building personal sig tags.

To achieve this, it will generally be made of a soft material, lubricated, and sometimes heated. There are different types of artificial vaginas. They may be designed for medical research purposes, animal breeding, or as a sex toy for erotic stimulation. Strokers and sleeves are sex toys usually designed as a handheld way to simulate a sex act, while an artificial vagina installed in a sex doll can be used hands-free. TOC Veterinary use A breeding mount with a built-in artificial vagina used to collect semen from horses for use in artificial insemination Artificial vaginas are widely used by farms in cattle artificial insemination programs and semen collection centers for collecting animal sperm and its further application. An artificial vagina designed for collecting semen will imitate some or all of the anatomical features and behaviors of an animal's vagina. There are several types of collecting apparatus, but the general design uses a tube with a normally sterile inner liner and hard outer shell. The walls of the tube may be hollow and filled with warm water to mimic a natural body temperature for better results, and may contain a filter to separate the semen. Human use Artificial vagina An artificial vagina, stroker, masturbation aid, masturbator, or pocket pussy is designed to simulate the sensation of sexual intercourse on the erect penis and to induce orgasm and ejaculation. It will often have moving parts such as vibrators that increase stimulation rather than accurately simulate a woman's vagina. Usually the artificial vagina has a realistic or close to realistic appearance with a sleeve, where the penis can be inserted. The sleeve, or as it is also called \\"vaginal tunnel\\", measures in average from 10 to 20 centimetres (4 to 8 inches) and can have an open end for inserting a vibrating bullet, if the user wishes. =Types= Realistic This type of artificial vagina is modeled on female genitals. For marketing purposes many manufacturers design the vagina like the exact replica of some famous pornographic actress' vulvas. Realistic vaginas are made to simulate the natural physiology: pubic bones, hair, labia, all natural creases and dimples, etc. Moreover, the male masturbators also come in many shapes and styles for many purposes; such as mouths for oral sex, or several realistic vaginas are manufactured with a narrower anal orifice (or anus) for those users who also like to simulate anal sex. The natural vagina has a series of ridges called rugae, and manufacturers often add nubs or ribs into artificial vaginas to simulate the rugae and enhance pleasure. In Japan, onacups are popular disposable artificial vaginas that simulate various sex acts and come with lubricant already inside. Vibrating These artificial vaginas superficially resemble the previous one, but they have the added feature of a vibrating element ‚Äî usually a removable vibrating bullet that can be easily inserted into a hole into the bottom or the end of the sleeve. For more intensive sensations there are a variety of functions: vibrating, pulsating, surging, rotating, multi-speed, etc. Vibrating bullets are usually controlled by a panel connected by a wire. Some kinds of vibrating artificial vagina are designed effect, replicating the role of a penis pump‚Äîwith a bulb squeezed by the user. Strokers Strokers are generally more discreet than other male masturbators. The inside of a stroker features a textured canal that stimulates the penis while the outside is often ridged to ensure a good grip during use. Some automatic strokers are powered by electric motors to simulate the sensations of sexual movements. Improvised In prison slang, a \\"fifi\\" refers to an artificial vagina usually made by rolling a trash bag or condom inside of a towel, and using some sort of lubricant such as hand lotion. These are also referred to as \\"fifi towels\\" or \\"fifi bags\\". Transgender In 2016, Buck Angel partnered with a sex toy company to release the Buck-Off FTM Stroker. It's designed \\"for [the] t-cock/enlarged clitoris\\" of a transgender man on hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It was the first such product, and won both an XBIZ Award and an AVN Award. Later, a smaller variant for people not on HRT called the Kiss-X was released. =Materials= The artificial vagina as a sex toy is designed from materials that imitate the feel of natural skin. The materials used in manufacturing artificial vaginas are stretchable and elastic to accommodate different penis sizes. * Cyberskin, Ultra realistic or Futurotic (mixture of PVC and silicone) and some other patented materials - natural-feeling materials that are quite porous, therefore requiring special care before and after use. These materials from the trademarked lines are also sensual and plush. * Plants (fruits and vegetables) - hollow cucumbers, banana skins, papayas and other produce are widely available, low cost, and have a flesh-like texture. * Rubber (elastic hydrocarbon polymer) - a flexible and resilient material with high durability. The porous rubber makes it hard to clean. * Soft plastics (Poly vinyl chloride) - popular material for sex toys that has a jelly-like feel, though it has a plasticizer odor. * Latex (natural rubber derived from plants) - flexible material that may cause allergic reactions in some individuals. * TPE (Thermoplastic elastomers)- Most common and can be used to make dolls more cheaply than silicone. The above materials are all porous and therefore require special care and cleaning to avoid bacterial accumulation. Manufacturers recommend protecting them by applying a condom during use. This is less of a concern with artificial vaginas made from silicone, which, while generally more expensive, is non-porous and can be disinfected after cleaning with a bleach solution or heat. = Medical usage = Masturbators are sometimes used for medical research. For example, Kobori et al. at Dokkyo Medical University have applied a Japanese onacup for ejaculatory dysfunction studies.

Early life  Born in Warley Edge, Halifax, West Yorkshire, the son of a stonemason and builder, and youngest of three children, Walker (always known as 'Blondie') was educated at Heath Grammar School but left school early, aged 15, to join his father's building firm; he did however continue to study three nights a week at technical college for the national building exam. However, at the age of 18 his father died, leaving Blondie in charge. At the outbreak of war, construction was deemed a reserved occupation, but he was \\"mad keen on flying\\"Walker, Arnold. A Fighter Pilot's Reminiscences and immediately volunteered for the Royal Air Force.  RAF career  Walker undertook pilot training in Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. On completion of his training he was a sergeant. He was then commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Service No 115919) as a pilot officer on probation on 1 December 1941. He returned to the UK and converted to the Hurricane. He was then sent to the Middle East, sailing to Freetown in Sierra Leone before flying across the desert to Khartoum and on to Port Said where he was mostly protecting convoys. His first kill was a Junkers Ju 88. In August 1942, Walker joined No. 94 Squadron, which soon received four Hawker Hurricanes donated by Lady MacRobert, whose three sons had died while serving in the RAF, one of them with No. 94 Squadron. Their names and coat of arms were painted on the nose of the aircraft, and Walker was allocated \\"Sir Roderic\\", which he flew during the North African campaign. He was promoted war substantive flying officer on 1 October 1942. After his experiences flying with No. 94 Squadron, Walker was offered an instructor's job. He did not want this, so volunteered to transfer to No. 6 Squadron RAF who were preparing to join the war in Italy. He was promoted to war substantive flight lieutenant on 1 December 1943. On 8 August 1944, he was awarded an \\"immediate\\" Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), which is a field award; the citation read: On 14 November 1944 he was awarded a bar to his DFC. However, on his return from operations in October 1944, Blondie was posted as an instructor on the Hawker Typhoon, based in the New Forest. He was released from RAF service in 1946.  Postwar career  Walker returned to Halifax to re-establish the family building company, Joseph Walker & Son, which had been shut down during the war. He wrote a short memoir of his wartime experiences with the dedication: \\"To my two ground crew ‚Äì without your fabulous service of my aircraft I would not be alive today\\". Immediately after the war, Joseph Walker & Son built more than 2,000 council houses and 1,000 private houses. He continued to build houses in the Calderdale area of West Yorkshire for the next half-century. He also had building interests in Perth, Western Australia, where he would later move to. He was a Liberal councillor for Warley Ward in Halifax during the early 1950s and was elected president of the Halifax Building Trades Council.  Personal life  Walker was known to be a fierce competitor in sport, business and life. He played golf off a handicap of four, was captain of West End Golf Club, Halifax and also made an honorary member of The Royal Perth Golf Club. He skied virtually every year in Kitzb√ºhel from 1948 until he was 80 years old. He was known in Kitzb√ºhel as \\"Halifax\\", some locals even assuming he was the Earl of Halifax. He married three times. He married Maisie, who he had known since he was 18 before being sent to the Middle East in 1941. He had a son, Johnny who predeceased him in 2007, a daughter, Diana, three stepsons and two grandchildren, Melissa and Daniel. In later life, Walker lived nine months of the year in Perth, spending the remainder in his hometown of Halifax, West Yorkshire.

T. Walsh, and Kiefer Sutherland in supporting roles. It was adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin from his 1989 play of the same name and includes contributions by William Goldman. The film revolves around the court-martial of two U.S. Marines charged with the murder of a fellow Marine and the tribulations of their lawyers as they prepare a case to defend their clients. Plot U.S. Marines Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private First Class Louden Downey are facing a general court-martial, accused of murdering fellow Marine William Santiago at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Santiago had poor relations with his fellow Marines, compared unfavorably to them, and broke the chain of command in an attempt to get transferred out of Guantanamo. Base Commander Colonel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson) and his officers argue about the best course of action: while Jessup's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson (J. T. Walsh), advocates that Santiago be transferred, Jessup dismisses the option and instead orders Santiago's commanding officer, Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland), to \\"train\\" Santiago to become a better Marine. While it is believed that the motive in Santiago's murder was retribution for naming Dawson in a fenceline shooting, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) largely suspects Dawson and Downey carried out a \\"code red\\" order: a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway wants to defend the two, but the case is given to Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) - an inexperienced and unenthusiastic lawyer with a penchant for plea bargains. Galloway and Kaffee instantly conflict, with Galloway unsettled by Kaffee's apparent laziness whilst Kaffee resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee and Galloway travel to Guantanamo base Cuba to question Colonel Jessup and others. Under questioning, Jessup claims Santiago was set to be transferred the next day. When Kaffee negotiates a plea bargain with the prosecutor Ross, Dawson and Downey refuse to go along, insisting that Kendrick had indeed given them the \\"code red\\" order and that they never intended Santiago to die. Dawson shows outright contempt for Kaffee, refusing to salute or acknowledge him as an officer because Dawson sees him as having no honor by choosing a plea bargain over defending their actions. Lt. Col Markinson disappears. Kaffee plans to have himself removed as counsel as he sees going to trial as pointless. At the arraignment, Kaffee unexpectedly enters a plea of not guilty, explaining to Galloway and Weinberg that he realized the reason he was chosen to handle this case was because it was expected he would accept a plea, and the matter would be kept quiet. After the case begins, Markinson later reveals himself to Kaffee and states, unequivocally, that Jessup never ordered a transfer for William Santiago. The defense manages to establish that Cpl Dawson had been denied promotion for smuggling food to a Marine who had been sentenced to bread and water: clearly disobeying a direct order. However, the defense then suffer two major setbacks: Downey, under cross-examination, reveals he was not actually present when Dawson received the supposed \\"code red\\" order, and Markinson, after he tells Kaffee that Jessup never ordered the transfer, but, ashamed that he failed to protect a Marine under his command, commits suicide before he can testify. Without Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost. He later returns home in a drunken stupor, lamenting that he fought the case instead of taking a deal. Galloway encourages Kaffee to call Jessup as a witness, despite the risk of being court-martialed for smearing a high-ranking officer. Jessup spars evenly with Kaffee's questioning, but is unnerved when Kaffee points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup stated his Marines never disobey orders and that Santiago was to be transferred for his own safety; if, Kaffee asks, Jessup ordered his men to leave Santiago alone, then how could Santiago be in danger? Irate at being caught in a lie and disgusted by what he sees as Kaffee's impudence towards the Marines, Jessup extols the military's importance, and his own, to national security. When asked point-blank if he ordered the \\"code red\\", Jessup continues with his self-important rant until, after repeatedly being asked the question, he bellows with contempt that, in fact, he did order the \\"code red.\\" Jessup tries to leave the courtroom but is promptly arrested. Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder and conspiracy charges, but found guilty of \\"conduct unbecoming\\" and ordered to be dishonorably discharged. Dawson accepts the verdict, but Downey does not understand what they did wrong. Dawson explains that they had failed to defend those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago. As the two are leaving, Kaffee tells Dawson that he does not need to wear a patch on his arm to have honor. Dawson sheds his previous contempt for Kaffee, acknowledges him as an officer, and renders a salute. The film ends with Kaffee and Ross exchanging kudos before Ross departs to arrest Kendrick.

She was going to Guantanamo Bay to defend a group of Marines who came close to killing a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior officer. Sorkin took that information and wrote much of his story on cocktail napkins while bartending at the Palace Theatre on Broadway. His roommates and he had purchased a Macintosh 512K, so when he returned home, he would empty his pockets of the cocktail napkins and type them into the computer, forming a basis from which he wrote many drafts for A Few Good Men. In 1988, Sorkin sold the film rights for his play to producer David Brown before it premiered, in a deal reportedly \\"well into six figures\\". Brown had read an article in The New York Times about Sorkin's one-act play Hidden in This Picture, and he found out Sorkin also had a play called A Few Good Men that was having off-Broadway readings. William Goldman did an uncredited rewrite of the script that Sorkin liked so much, he incorporated the changes made into the stage version. Brown was producing a few projects at TriStar Pictures, and he tried to interest them in making A Few Good Men into a film, but his proposal was declined due to the lack of star-actor involvement. Brown later got a call from Alan Horn at Castle Rock Entertainment, who was anxious to make the film. Rob Reiner, a producing partner at Castle Rock, opted to direct it. The film had a production budget of between $33 and 40 million. Nicholson would later comment on the $5 million he received for his role, \\"It was one of the few times when it was money well spent.\\"Jack Nicholson. IMDb The film starts with a performance of \\"Semper Fidelis\\" by a U.S. Marine Corps marching band, and a Silent Drill performed by the Texas A&M; University Corps of Cadets Fish Drill Team (portraying the United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon). Several former Navy JAG lawyers have been identified as the basis for Tom Cruise's character Lt. Kaffee. These include Don Marcari, now an attorney in Virginia; former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias; Chris Johnson, now practicing in California; and Walter Bansley III, now practicing in Connecticut. However, in a September 15, 2011, article in The New York Times, Sorkin was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúThe character of Dan Kaffee in A Few Good Men is entirely fictional and was not inspired by any particular individual.‚Äù Wolfgang Bodison was a film location scout when he was asked to take part in a screen test for the part of Dawson.Noted in the A Few Good Men DVD commentary Reception =Box office= The film premiered at the Odeon Cinema, Manchester, England, and opened on December 11, 1992, in 1,925 theaters. It grossed $15,517,468 in its opening weekend and was the number-one film at the box office for the next three weeks. Overall, it grossed $141,340,178 in the U.S. and $101,900,000 internationally for a total of $243,240,178. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 7.04/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"An old- fashioned courtroom drama with a contemporary edge, A Few Good Men succeeds on the strength of its stars, with Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, and especially Jack Nicholson delivering powerful performances that more than compensate for the predictable plot.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A+\\" on an A+ to F scale, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service to earn the score. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine said, \\"That the performances are uniformly outstanding is a tribute to Rob Reiner (Misery), who directs with masterly assurance, fusing suspense and character to create a movie that literally vibrates with energy.\\" Richard Schickel in Time magazine called it \\"an extraordinarily well-made movie, which wastes no words or images in telling a conventional but compelling story.\\" Todd McCarthy in Variety magazine predicted, \\"The same histrionic fireworks that gripped theater audiences will prove even more compelling to filmgoers due to the star power and dramatic screw-tightening.\\" Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic in the Chicago Sun-Times, giving it two-and-a-half out of four stars and finding its major flaw was revealing the courtroom strategy to the audience before the climactic scene between Cruise and Nicholson. Ebert wrote, \\"In many ways this is a good film, with the potential to be even better than that. The flaws are mostly at the screenplay level; the film doesn't make us work, doesn't allow us to figure out things for ourselves, is afraid we'll miss things if they're not spelled out.\\" Widescreenings noted that for Tom Cruise's character Daniel Kaffee, \\"Sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of Top Gun,\\" where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In Top Gun, Cruise plays Mitchell who is a \\"hotshot military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.\\" Sorkin and Reiner are praised in gradually unveiling Kaffee's potential in the film. Home media A Few Good Men was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993. The VHS was again released along with a DVD release on May 29, 2001 and later a Blu-Ray release followed on September 8, 2007.

A station where goods are not specifically received or dispatched, but simply transferred on their way to their destination between the railway and another means of transport, such as ships or lorries, may be referred to as a transshipment station. This often takes the form of a container terminal and may also be known as a container station. Goods stations were more widespread in the days when the railways were common carriers and were often converted from former passenger station whose traffic had moved elsewhere.  First goods station  Park Lane Goods Terminus at Liverpool's docks was the world's first station built entirely for freight. The world's first dedicated goods terminal was the 1830 Park Lane Goods Station at the South End Liverpool Docks. Built in 1830 the terminal was reached by a tunnel from Edge Hill in the east of the city. The station was a part of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was also a first being the first inter-city railway.  Location  Goods stations may be located: * next to a passenger station (either on the far side of the platforms as seen from the station building or immediately alongside it), * separately from the associated passenger station on one of the railway lines leading from it, * as an independent facility not connected with any particular passenger station. Where individual goods wagons are dispatched to specific goods stations, they are usually delivered to special shunting stations or marshalling yards where they are sorted and then collected. Sometimes there are combined shunting and goods stations.  Equipment  Goods station with fan of sidings and hump signals at Rostock, East Germany, 1986 A goods station is usually equipped with a large number of storage and loading sidings in order to fulfil its task. On the loading sidings there may be fixed facilities, such as cranes or conveyor belts, or temporary equipment, such as wheeled ramps for the loading of sugar beet. Stations where the primary purpose of the station is the handling of containers are also known as container terminals (CT). They are equipped with special cranes and fork-lift vehicles for loading containers from lorries or ships onto the railway vehicles, or vice versa. If only a small section of a station is used for the loading and unloading of goods, it may be referred to as the \\"loading area\\" or \\"loading dock\\" and has its own access and signposting. Often there are no facilities for loading and the individual firm has to organise its own loading equipment such as conveyor belts or lorry cranes. Such loading areas were mainly to be found on branch lines, narrow gauge railways and at smaller stations. Medium-sized and larger goods stations usually have marshalling or shunting sidings to enable trains to be divided amongst the various local loading and sorting sidings and industrial branches, at the same time performing the function of a small railway hub. In many European countries they are also equipped with a hump yard.  Changing nature of goods stations  Former goods station at Linz, Austria, shortly before its demolition (circa 2006) Due to the increasing amount of goods traffic that has switched from rail to road many goods stations and, in consequence marshalling yards, closed and were often eventually demolished, so that reviving rail services at the same location is no longer possible. In combined goods and hub stations with a hump yard, the latter was closed if the station lost its role as a railway hub, whilst the local goods function was retained. In addition, in most countries, part-load or parcel goods services have been entirely transferred to the roads, which has led to the closure of goods sheds as well as most of the public loading sidings and ramps used by smaller customers. As a result, most of the remaining goods stations today are just used as container or transshipment stations. European terminology In German-speaking countries, various terms for goods station are used including G√ºterbahnhof in Germany (abb: Gbf) and Switzerland (abb: GB), Frachtenbahnhof (Fbf) in Austria; Umschlagbahnhof (Ubf) for transshipment station and Containerbahnhof or Containerterminal (CT) for container station or terminal. In French : gare aux marchandises or gare de fret.

The song was released as a promotional single in 1964 during the height of Beatlemania. It was a tribute to The Beatles.Billboard (magazine): Cher (biography) The original vinyl is now a valuable rarity. In 1999 the song was covered by German electronic duo Stereo Total and released on their studio album My Melody. Song information \\"Ringo, I Love You\\" is the first solo song recorded by Cher. The single was released under the name of Bonnie Jo Mason because producer Phil Spector wanted American names for his singers, and Cherilyn La Piere was not a name he considered sufficiently American. The single failed to chart nationally, and did not pick up much local radio play, although it was a minor hit in Buffalo, New York.http://las- solanas.com/arsa/chart_view.php?sv=13535http://las- solanas.com/arsa/chart_view.php?sv=13616 It has been suggested that many radio stations would not consider playing the record because they thought Cher's extremely low vocals were a man's vocals, although the artist's female moniker and the fact that the singer explicitly identifies herself as a girl in the song makes this story open to question. Therefore, they believed it was a male homosexual singing a love song as a dedication to Ringo Starr (The Beatles). The track does not have Spector's usual Wall of Sound production techniques, instead featuring more of a crudely arranged \\"beat group\\" sound. Spector, if he did indeed produce the track, took no producer credit, and the record did not appear on Philles Records, Spector's usual label. \\"Beatle Blues\\" is on the single's B-side, a typical tossed-off Spector instrumental made so that the A-side would get all the attention. \\"Ringo, I Love You\\" has been released on compact disc on small indie record label, although not on Cher releases; these albums are \\"Bravo!

History Stepney Parish, as it was originally named, was one of the original 30 Anglican parishes in the Province of Maryland. It was built originally to serve the needs of Green Hill Town, a port of entry created as part of an Act of Provincial Assembly in 1706. However, the town never succeeded, although nearby Salisbury, Maryland, founded three decades later, for much of the 19th century became Maryland's second busiest port, known for its export of seafood as well as agricultural products. This original Stepney parish church was renamed after the apostle St. Bartholomew in the mid-19th century as chapels were built nearby. Current Stepney parish church The current Stepney parish church is St. Mary's Tyaskin, Maryland, about the same mid-19th century age and style and distance from this historic church as St. Philip's Episcopal Church in Quantico (deriving from a Native American word for \\"place of dancing\\"). Since Stepney parish extended up the Wicomico river watershed up the Delmarva Peninsula into what became Sussex County, Delaware, Stepney Parish helped found several other parishes, most of which began as chapels of ease. These included Spring Hill Church on Route 50 (built in 1776 and which arson recently burned down) in nearby Hebron, St. Peter's in Salisbury (founded 1758, burned down in 1860 and rebuilt), as well as Old Christ Church (Laurel, Delaware) (built in 1772, in wood but the same style as this building) and St. Luke's Protestant Episcopal Church (Seaford, Delaware) (built in 1843, incorporating St. Mary's congregation founded in 1704 but disestablished in the American Revolution). Architecture The single-story, Flemish bond gable-front brick church was built in 1733, as is shown in the restored brickwork on the end facing the water. The interior is spare, with box pews and several memorial plaques to long-serving rectors, as well as William Murray Stone who became Episcopal Bishop of Maryland. Adjacent to the church are several marked burials with 18th and 19th century stones, as well as agricultural fields and a golf course. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The church no longer holds regular services. It is opened at least once a year in August for a St. Bartholomew's Day worship service held by several local Episcopal churches.Wicomico Cemeteries Project - GREEN HILL (ST.

He was also a successful Australian rules football coach and acted as both reserves and under-19s coach at various clubs in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Universally known as \\"Slug\\", his nickname arose as a result of an incident during his National Service at Puckapunyal.Never a punch pulled Career Jordon took a total of 230 dismissals in the Sheffield Shield and 283 for all first-class matches. His tally at both Shield and first-class level remained a Victorian record until surpassed by his replacement Richie Robinson, who himself was later bettered by Darren Berry. In 1970/71 he managed a career best ten dismissals in a match against South Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. His only first-class hundred was an innings of 134, also against South Australia, in the 1963/64 Sheffield Shield. The South Australian bowling attack was led by Gary Sobers and while he ran through Victoria's batting lineup with six second innings wickets, Jordon resisted with a century before falling LBW to Neil Hawke. The wicket-keeper captained Victoria in five Sheffield Shield matches during his career, three of them in the 1968/69 season. Jordon came close to playing Test cricket, touring both India and South Africa in 1969/70 as a standby for Brian Taber. Although he appeared in four of Australia's first-class warm up matches in India and six in South Africa, Jordon was not required for any of the Tests. According to Ashley Mallett's biography of Ian Chappell, Chappelli Speaks Out, Bill Lawry was considering selecting Jordon to play in the fourth test instead of Taber because of the former's superior batting. Chappell said he would not play in the side if Jordon was picked because the wicketkeeper was a cheat. This was based on an incident during a game on the recent Indian tour when Australia was playing South Zone.South Zone v Australia Bangalore 20‚Äì22 December 1969 (3-day match) E. A. S. Prasanna was facing Alan Connolly with Jordon standing up to the stumps ‚Äì he appeared to miss the ball and his off stump was knocked forward. Jordon appealed and Prasanna eventually walked but Chappell believed the ball had missed Prasanna's stumps and rebounded off Jordon's pads to break the wicket ‚Äì and that Jordon knew this.Ashley Mallett, Chappelli Speaks Out, Allen and Unwin, 2005 p 38, 50 Jordon played his district cricket for Richmond (one season), Carlton (ten seasons) and Fitzroy (five seasons). He also was captain/coach of the Dandenong Cricket Club in the VSDCA in the early 1970s. Football During his early sporting years, Jordon was also an Australian rules football player, and he appeared in 96 matches for the Coburg Football Club in the Victorian Football Association, also serving as captain at the club for a time. He was a highly regarded player, and several Victorian Football League clubs were interested in recruiting him, but he retired from playing in 1962 to concentrate on cricket. He was later a higher successful minor grade coach. Jordon led clubs at under-19 and reserve level, spending time at , , , , as well as TAC Cup club Central/Prahran Dragons. Known for his colourful language and direct approach, Jordon had particular success with Melbourne's and Richmond's under-19s. He was credited with thirteen premierships from sixteen grand final appearances during his minor grade coaching career. While he was in charge of the reserves at North Melbourne he was called up to coach the seniors for a Victorian Football League game in 1976 because Ron Barassi was unavailable. A parody of Jordon, named Jay \\"Grub\\" Gordon, appears in the Specky Magee series of novels written by former Melbourne player Garry Lyon and author Felice Arena.

The College was founded in 1897 by members of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, a religious congregation founded by Father Jules Chevalier in France in 1874. The College provides a religious and general education for approximately 800 girls from Year 7 to Year 12. History and description The College was moved to the Kensington site in 1913 and until 1995 was administered by the Sisters. It is part of the system of schools under the auspices of the Catholic Education Office in the Archdiocese of Sydney. At its opening, the college was an impoverished Catholic school, with little or no support from the government. As a result, the schools oldest structure, the Fyfe Wing, was not completed immediately, and construction stalled during 1914 when funds dried up. In 1915, the Franciscan friar Tony Macfarlane was assigned to teach mathematics and science at the school. Friar Tony Macfarlane had a strong background in carpentry and a brief career as a Civil Engineer prior to taking his vows as a monk. Friar Macfarlane took it upon himself to complete the construction of the school's main building, in an effort to remove classes from the OLSH convent next door. The OLSH nuns were involved in administration and some minor laboring work, with many parishioners volunteering their knowledge and labour time to help. The college was thus completed. The Fyfe Wing was listed as a heritage site in 1984. Every year, the school celebrates this achievement on the Feast of St Francis. The school holds a bake sale, with all proceeds going to missionaries in Papua New Guinea and housing projects in the Northern Territory. The college's present location in Kensington makes it accessible from the city and close to the University of New South Wales. It draws most of its students from the immediate local area and from Brighton-Le-Sands/Sans Souci. It is surrounded by community resources and leisure facilities. The campus is adjacent to the OLSH Provincial House, OLSH Convent and St Joseph's Aged Care Facility. It is near the Sacred Heart Monastery, Chevalier Resource Centre, and the parish church and primary college of Our Lady of the Rosary.

Kumroj is a town in Khairhani Municipality in Chitwan District in the Narayani Zone of southern Nepal. The municipality was promulgated on 18 May 2014 by merging the existing Khairahani, Kumroj and Chainpur VDCs. Kumroj is 190 km south-west of the Kathmandu valley stationed in the Rapti valley, also known as the Inner Terai or Dun. The village is situated at an altitude of 1000 ft above the sea level surrounded by two mountain ranges; the mahabharat ranges of hills on the north and the churiya siwalik hills on the south. The main point of attraction is the Chitwan National Park which today stands as a successful testimony of nature conservation in south Asia Region. Historically it was established in 1973 as the first national park of the Nepal to preserve a unique ecosystems significantly valuable to the whole world en routing this area on the world heritage site list in 1984. In the near future, this town would be one of the potential Eco-tourism village destination. Kumroj is dedicated to protect the wild animals, community forest and the Chitwan national park. Once the Southern belt of Nepal was afflicted by malaria epidemics. Tharu, the native tribe, were able to thrive even in malaria. As malaria subsided, more and more people started migrating in this place in the search of arable land, which eventually made Kumroj as a multicultural and multiethinic place. Irrigated low land has been the main stud of agriculture, permitting Rice-Rice-Pulse cropping pattern feasible. Geography =Climate= There are three distinct seasons in this town. Winter starts from early November averaging 15-18 ¬∞ C day and 3-6 ¬∞ C night temperatures. Following winter comes the Summer from early April reaching 37-42 ¬∞ C day and 25-28 ¬∞ C night temperature, with around 40 % relative humidity. Third season is the monsoon, starting from July. During this time humidity is about 100% and on average we receive 100 mm of rain a day. =Vegetation= There are two main types of habitat in Kumroj: Tropical riverine forest and grass land which are important habitats for wild animals and birds. =Fauna= Kumroj community forest consists of 1,300 hectors of land which is connected to Chitwan National Park. In the community forest animal species including deer, sambar, chital, and barking deer, are found throughout the forest. The one-horned rhinoceros is commonly found and attracts many tourists to the community each year. Other mammalian species includes Bengal tigers, leopards, sloth bears, small Indian civets, and wild boars. Additionally, wild elephants are occasionally seen in the forest. Various reptile and bird species are also been found. Economy Kumroj is a largely agricultural-based community. The main crops are rice, wheat, maize, mustard and various kind of seasonal vegetables. Water buffalo, cattle and goats are common livestock in the community. Selling dairy milk is the second occupation for some community members, and nowadays there are more different kinds of businesses like grocery shops, agricultural supply depot, stationery stores, tailoring. Kumroj is gradually running community development and tourism development and infrastructure. Inside the community forest there are two watchtowers where visitors and tourists can spend the night to watch wild animals. The fee for staying overnight goes to community development and forest management. Elephant safaris are held in Kumroj community forest, along with jungle hiking. Kumroj declared Kumroj VDC as the first Model Biogas VDC at a special ceremony organized in Kumroj on June 2 on the occasion of World Environment Day, 2013. Around 80% of total households of the VDC have installed biogas plants with attached toilets. There is a dairy in Kumroj, with a milk cooling centre to preserve the milk in warm weather. There is also a co-operative bank, providing retail banking and personal loans.

Articled to Walter Bryan Wood, he later assisted Sir Edwin Lutyens and then Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, consulting architects to the First Garden City, Letchworth, arousing his interest in housing questions. Career Returning from the war of 1914-18, where he lost a leg, James went into partnership with Charles Murray Hennell in 1919, full of enthusiasm for the ideals of a new social order. He lectured on ‚ÄúHousing and Site Planning,‚Äù at the Architectural Association in 1921-22, and published a book Small Houses for the Community with photographs by F. R. Yerbury, in 1924. Both Hennell and James had worked at Letchworth, and much of their early work together was at Welwyn Garden City. They were also responsible for Swanpool Garden Suburb, Lincoln; government subsidy houses in Thorpe Bay, Essex; and the layout and design of housing schemes in other parts of the country. After Hennell's death much of James's work was done at Hampstead Garden Suburb, including his own house and several on a larger scale. In partnership with Stephen Rowland Pierce, F.R.I.B.A., James won competitions for three public buildings. Of these the most important was the City Hall, Norwich, on an elevated site between the ancient Guildhall and the Church of St. Peter Mancroft above the market place. A building on a grand scale, it combines James's neo-Georgian architecture with a reference to the then fashionable Swedish movement and the tower of Stockholm City Hall at Ostberg. Norwich City Hall is the most important of the public buildings by James, but the most characteristic is the Hertford County Building. Here he was most in sympathy with the Georgian architecture of the county. He also designed the municipal buildings at Slough, a library for the National Book League, and made additions to All Souls College, Oxford. James, active despite his war injury, was described as a tall man with soft, flexible, and rather boyish features, giving the impression of great sensibility. He had a good deal of quiet humour, affecting a robust attitude to life that contrasted with his appearance. He became A.R.I.B.A. in 1918 and F.R.I.B.A. in 1926, and served as R.I.B.A. vice president 1947-8. He was elected A.R.A. in 1937 and R.A. in 1946, and won the London Architecture bronze medal in 1949. He married the designer Margaret Calkin James in 1922.

Cargoes typically transferred via STS methods include crude oil, liquefied gas (LPG or LNG), bulk cargo, and petroleum products. The nomenclature STS transfer should be used in reference to techniques used by civilian merchant vessels, as differentiated from underway replenishment which is the term used by the US Navy for similar, but usually far more complicated, operations between naval vessels while underway. Most of cargo operations take place between a ship and a land-based terminal. Nevertheless, it sometimes can be useful to transfer cargo from one ship to another in the open sea and this is called a ship-to-ship operation. One vessel will act as the terminal whilst the other one will moor. The receiving ship is called the daughter vessel and the delivering vessel is called STBL (Ship to be lightered) or Mother vessel.  Reasons for  *Lightening a vessel prior to harbor entering or for re-floating *Bunkering operations *Earning time in a very tight schedule *Commercial reasons, i.e. the cargo changes ownership while the carrying vessel is at sea *Lightering a vessel for emergency reasons, usually after a grounding or similar incident Due Diligence Ship-to-ship transfer operations take place at open sea or at OPL (outer port limit). The involved parties are the 2 participating vessels and the Service Provider who provides the STS equipment and the qualified Mooring Master (Person in Overall Advisory Control, POAC). There is no direct contractual relationship among those parties and both Masters are responsible for ensuring safety. Thus the prudent exercise of due diligence prior to commencement of the STS Operation is the only feasible way that will allow the Masters and their ship operators in ensuring safety. Due diligence should take place in the following phases of the Ship-to-Ship operation: * Ship nomination and clearance requests * Appointment of Service Provider and POAC * Technical advice to the Master by his technical Operator * Risk Assessment procedure * Assessment of the STS location The level of due diligence exercised by technical operators and Masters is mainly governed by SOLAS chapter IX (the ISM Code) which mandates the assessment of \\"objective evidence\\" towards actions that will ensure safety. \\"Objective evidence\\" consists of past assessments of STS records, crew experience, lessons learned from past near misses/ incidents, past performance data of vessels, STS Service Providers, Mooring Masters (POAC), best industry practices, etc. There are relevant services that provided access to such data, some of the open-source. Although the term \\"due diligence\\" is vague, its application will be challenged either during an incident investigation, or relevant litigation. Technical operators should have the means to prove that they are in compliance with both commercial guidelines and statutory requirements.  Maneuverability Issues It is not easy to close two moving objects smoothly and safely. One should account prevailing weather conditions and most important the interaction forces exerted during approaching. Therefore, seafarers have established a few procedures which will be used regarding the sizes and maneuverabilities of the vessels involved. We can consider three configurations *Vessels making way, fast approach (1) *Mother vessel stopped (2) *Vessels making way, tactful approach (3) *Approaching with a tug assistance (4) = Vessels making way, fast approach = The small pilot boat considers this LNG as a stable reference This manoeuvre is designed for a vessel with a high maneuverability which approaches such a big vessel that it can be considered as a reference on its own. At that moment the mother vessel can maintain her course and slightly decrease her speed to reduce her bow-wave and the small vessel will approach to finally get on a parallel track. = Mother vessel stopped = When the maneuverability of the berthing vessel is not really high it is often less dangerous for her to approach a vessel stopped in the water so that there will be a protected side from the waves and wind and there will also not be any bow wave. At that moment the vessel approaches on the quarter of the mother ship and gets on a parallel heading at slow speed. In that case an artificial type wave can be created which can prevent the ship from stopping. = Vessels making way, tactful approach = It is of huge importance to maintain the heading of the ‚Äúterminal‚Äù and this is not possible with stopped vessels. That's why we will not consider a static reference system but one in translation because a ship needs some speed to maintain her heading. The biggest vessel will act has a terminal heading on a steady course at maneuvering speed. Then the second ship will come closer in the same direction but a bit faster. When the vessels are navigating side to side, they can be moored. First of all, the spring lines will be tensioned to maintain the vessels at the same speed. Then the breast lines will keep the vessels as close as possible. It is also possible to add head and stern lines to prevent any longitudinal motion. image:STS01.JPGVessels on a same course prior closing and exchanging lines image:Two_vessels_side_by_side.jpgFirst step of the mooring operation, securing the fore spring image:STS02.JPGPassing the connecting hose prior cargo operation Regulations STS Operations are part of vessel's operation. Until 2009 there were no international regulations that explicitly prescribe how these operations should take place. These operations are carried out in accordance with guidelines set out by the latest Oil Companies International Marine Forum and the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), with the strictest adherence to safety regulations. These are the industry guidelines which are part of the contractual commitment between the ship owner and the STS Organizer (Charterer, Cargo owner, Oil Major etc.) According to International Maritime Organization regulations vessels transferring OIL CARGO must have an approved STS operational manual that describes the procedure. Record Keeping, Assessment & Auditing According to IMO MEPC 186(59) records of STS Operations should be retained for 3 years. Although the records consist on STS checklists and Risk Assessment procedure those should be assessed after the completion of the STS Operation and the outcome of the assessment should be utilized in the Due diligence process.

Only a single aircraft was built, with the type not being chosen for production. Design and developmentBruce in Flight, 29 November 1957, p.846. Squadron-Commander J.W.Seddon RN, officer commanding of the Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot, realised that high-lift wings, as described by the National Physical Laboratory in 1916, had the potential to improve the lifting capacity of the Sopwith Baby seaplane. He instructed the Depot's Experimental Construction Depot to make and fit such wings to a Sopwith Baby, the resulting aircraft being named the P.V.1. The new wings had the same area as the thinner aerofoils used on the Baby but were mounted with greater stagger; larger floats were also fitted. The thicker wings, heavier floats and additional 300 lb. (136 kg) ballast added a total of 600 lb. (272 kg) to the weight of the Baby, but the P.V.1 was still able to reach a height of 8,000 ft. (2,438 m) and achieve a speed of 67 kt (77 mph, 124 km/h). While it successfully demonstrated the performance of the new high-lift wings, the Fairey Hamble Baby was placed in production instead.

Located just across Nepal's Chitwan National Park, Sukranagar is home to subsistence farmers who nominally live off the land using traditional farming practices. Being in the proximity of the national park, farmers here traditionally had a close relationship with the National Park. This relationship also invited some illegal transactions of forest products and livestock grazing in the park, and illegal hunting and fishing, all despised by the conservation authorities. Similarly crop damage by wild animals from the park have become a matter of concern for the local people. In various ways, there has been a reciprocal relationship between the park and local people. The people settled adjacent to the park are dependent on its resources primarily due to absence of convenient alternatives. This means that there is a tremendous opportunity for thoughtful and resourceful people to develop alternative economic and agricultural practices that can positively exploit the proximity of the park and the rich combination of plants and animals that exist in the park. There is an opportunity for conservation, environmental safeguard, and economic activities.

History The church is medieval.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner The dedication to St. Michael was made in 1964 as the previous dedication had been lost. It has a tower that was built in 1070. It originally had no ground level door, and the entrance was through a door on the roof. Parishioners had to access the room by climbing a ladder. The walls of the church are five feet thick and it was a refuge for residents during attacks by the French who had sailed up Newtown Creek. A \\"3 pound\\" parish gun which was inscribed 'Schawflet' was kept in the tower until 1779. The church had a steeple that was added around 1800, but the steeple was determined to be unstable and it was removed in 1912. The money for the steeple was raised by selling the parish gun and the church bells. This resulted in a local rhyme: ::\\"Shalfleet poor and simple people ::Sold their bells to build a steeple.\\" In 1889 the plaster was removed from ceiling and walls‚Äîthe latter a questionable proceeding‚Äîthe tower arch unblocked, a new door cut through the north face and the east window of the aisle reconstructed. The church is fortunate in having escaped late additions and thus remaining an excellent example, with the exception of the tower, of late 13th-century work. The entry is by the north door, bearing the date 1754 on its inner face, through the 12th-century opening with its primitive carved tympanum. The north wall is practically modern work, partly rebuilt on the old foundation and of the same thickness in 1812, when wooden mullioned windows with brick reveals took the place of what may have been 15th-century lights. The insertion of the wide arch in the 13th century, practically cutting away the whole eastern face of the tower at this stage, has resulted in a serious subsidence to the north and east, with a corresponding contortion of the arch. When this was blocked as a precautionary measure there is nothing to show, but its opening in 1889 and the cutting of a door in the northern face of the tower was an unwise and risky proceeding, probably resulting in the serious crack in the upper part of the north-east angle. A noticeable feature in the church is that the floor slopes down gradually to the east end without a break at the chancel arch. The two bells in the tower are inscribed 'May all whom I shall summon to the grave, The ransom of a well-spent life receive. Thos. Way, James Street, Churchwardens, 1815. T. Mears of London fecit.' The smaller bell has only the names of the churchwardens, J. Jolliffe and J. Cooper, and the date 1807.'Parishes: Shalfleet', A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5 (1912), pp. 272-278.

Career Menelaus entered service in 1810 under the command of Captain Peter Parker, and within weeks of commissioning was involved in the suppression of a mutiny aboard HMS Africaine. The notoriously brutal Captain Robert Corbet had been appointed to command Africaine and the crew had protested and refused to allow him to board. The Admiralty sent three popular officers to negotiate with the crew and ordered Menelaus to come alongside. If the crew of Africaine refused to agree with the appointment of Corbet, Parker had been ordered to fire on the ship until they submitted. The crew eventually agreed to allow Corbet aboard and Menelaus was not needed. In the summer of 1810, Parker was ordered to sail for the Indian Ocean to reinforce the squadron operating against √éle de France and participated in the capture of the island in December 1810. In 1812, Menelaus was part of the blockade of Toulon in the Mediterranean and operated against coastal harbours, shipping and privateers off the southern coast of France with some success. In 1813, Menelaus was transferred to the Atlantic for service convoying merchant ships to Canada in the War of 1812. On 23 March she captured Le Nouveau Phoenix. Menelaus was subsequently employed in raiding American positions along the Maryland coastline, destroying a coastal convoy in September. In 1814, Parker was ordered to operate against French ships in the Atlantic and recaptured a valuable Spanish merchant ship in January. Following the French surrender, Menelaus returned to service off the American seaboard. Menelaus 'was sent up the Chesapeake to divert the attention of the enemy in that quarter,' whilst General Ross's force was landed at Benedict. One of the ships crewman, Midshipman Frederick Chamier wrote ‚ÄúOur duty consisted in an eternal annoyance of the enemy, and therefore night and day we were employed in offensive operations...\\" Thereafter, Peter Parker was killed at the Battle of Caulk's Field in Kent County, Maryland, on 30 August 1814. He was among 14 British killed at the battle. From 13 to 15 September, Menelaus was present at the Battle of Baltimore, with one of her complement, William Pritchard, being hospitalised after losing two fingers. On 19 July 1815, Menelaus was in company with , , , Ferret and when they captured the French vessels Fortune, Papillon, Marie Graty, Marie Victorine, Cannoniere, and Printemps. The attack took place at Corrijou (Kor√©jou, east of Abervrach on the coast of Brittany), and during the action Ferret was able to prevent the escape of a French man- of-war brig that she forced ashore. Apparently, this cutting out expedition was the last of the war.Lee (1893), Vol. 35, p.403. Later career and fate Following Parker's death, command passed to Edward Dix and he remained on the ship until she was laid up at Sheerness in 1818. In 1820 she moved to Chatham and in 1832 became a hospital ship, becoming the quarantine ship at Sandgate Street. She was eventually sold 87 years after her construction, in 1897.

The text is available in Italian and Latin. On 28 October 1965, the bishops attending Second Vatican Council had asked Pope Paul to consider how the departments of the Roman Curia could \\"be reorganized and better adapted to the needs of the times, regions, and rites especially as regards their number, name, competence and peculiar method of procedure, as well as the coordination of work among them.\\" section 9. Early changes On 2 April 1964, Paul VI established the Pontifical Commission for Social Communications. As part of the preparations for the Second Vatican Council, Pope John XXIII has created the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity on 5 June 1960. Paul VI added two more secretariats to extend the Vatican's attempt to establish relationships with the non- Catholic world, with other religious groups and with the non-religious. On 19 May 1964, Paul VI established the Secretariate for non-Christians and named Cardinal Paolo Marella, a Vatican diplomat for forty years, fifteen of then stationed in Japan, to head it. The title of his decree, Progrediente concilio (\\"While the Council is proceeding\\"), hinted that this was a harbinger of a larger reform that would await the conclusion of the council. On 6 April 1965, Paul VI established the Secretariat for Dialogue with Non-Believers. He named Franz K√∂nig, Archbishop of Vienna, its president. Paul VI issued Integrae servandae on 7 December 1965, the eve of the ceremony marking the end of the Second Vatican Council. It accomplished one significant modification to that part of the Roman Curia that had proved most controversial during the council for its management‚Äìits critics would say manipulation‚Äìof the proceedings. With this letter, the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office temporarily lost its designation as \\"Sacred\\" and received a new title that specified its area of competence: the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It restricted the department's right to act secretly and provided rights to those accused of heresy. Authors of books acquired rights to notification and a hearing before the department could ban their work. It was instructed to coordinate its work with the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which meant that it would have to take account of new scholarly approaches to biblical texts, a movement it had long resisted. Its traditional autonomy and insularity were challenged by requirements to use consultors named by the pope and to consider the views of \\"congresses of the learned\\" and regional associations of bishops. Paul VI created the Council of the Laity and the Pontifical Commission Iustitia et Pax on 6 January 1967. To the latter, on 15 July 1971, he added the Pontifical Council Cor Unum for Promoting Human and Christian Development. He named Cardinal Jean Villot, his Secretary of State, as its president. Regimini Ecclesiae universae =Organization and responsibilities= With Regimini Ecclesiae universae, *The Sacred Consistorial Congregation became the Sacred Congregation for Bishops *The Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church became the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches, recognizing the existence of several Eastern Catholic Churches. It was also raised in rank ahead of the Congregation for Bishops. *The Sacred Congregation of the council, founded as the Sacred Congregation of the Council of Trent to implement that council's mandates, became the Congregation for the Clergy. *The Sacred Congregation of Religious became the Sacred Congregation for the Religious and Secular Institutes, making explicit its competence for institutes other than religious institutes in the strict sense). *The Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith became the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples *The Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities became the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education New bodies (largely taking over functions previously carried out, sometimes in less coordinated form, by earlier bodies) were founded by Regimini. They included two offices to manage and oversee financial affairs, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See and the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See. The functions of some offices that had already been severely reduced were abolished: the Sacred Ceremonial Congregation and the Apostolic Datary. The competencies of the Sacred Roman Rota and the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura were extended.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, eleventh preliminary paragraph =Procedures= Previously, only cardinals were members of the congregations of the Curia. Pope Paul VI decreed that the members could also be bishops who were not cardinals. With Regimini Ecclesiae universae he laid down also that appointments to membership of congregations and as heads of departments would be for five-year periods only, and that appointment for an additional five-year period would also be possible.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, eighth preliminary paragraph As before, the members of a congregation do not intervene in the day-to-day operations of the congregation, which is in the hands of the Prefect and the permanent staff, headed generally by the Secretary and the Undersecretary. Membership normally meet to discuss more general problems and to determine guidelines no more than once a year. The permanent staff is to be of international provenance, chosen from people with suitable preparation and with pastoral experience.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 3 These have no claim on promotion to the highest positions.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 4 Each congregation is to have consultors, who are appointed for five-year (renewable) periods.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 5 Account must be taken of the wishes of the episcopal conferences.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 8 The most widely known languages may be used, as well as Latin.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 10 Pope Paul also established that on the death of a pope the posts of heads of departments become vacant, with the exception of those of Cardinal Vicar for Rome, Camerlengo and Major Penitentiary.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, ninth preliminary paragraph A new pope is therefore free to name department heads of his own choosing. Periodic meetings of the heads of departments can be called by the Cardinal Secretary of State with a view to coordinating activities, providing information and gathering suggestions.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 18 Other meetings between officials of more than one departments are also held in accordance with needs.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 13-16 Meetings involving the Congregations for Bishops, for the Clergy, for Religious, and for Catholic Education are to be held at fixed times to deal with questions concerning the clergy in general.Regimini Ecclesiae universae, 17 Later changes The Sacred Congregation of Rites was divided into two on 8 May 1969 to become the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints with responsibility for managing cases of beatification and canonization and the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship with responsibility for liturgical practices. The later was combined on 11 July 1975 with the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments to form the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. The functions of the Apostolic Chancery, reduced by Pope Pius X in 1908 to little more than signing papal bulls were transferred in 1973 to the Cardinal Secretary of State.

He designed Magic Mountain theme park in Santa Clarita, California, the original Universal Studio Tours in California, Six Flags Over Texas, Marriott's Great America theme parks, as well as Opryland in Nashville, Tennessee.  Career  Duell was born on a farm in Russell County, Kansas, moved with his family to Los Angeles, California in 1912, and died of a stroke in Los Angeles, California. Duell attended the University of Southern California School of Architecture and graduated in 1925. Joining the Los Angeles architectural firm Webber, Staunton and Spaulding, Duell contributed to designs for notable building projects in metropolitan Los Angeles during the 1920s and 1930s, among them the Avalon Casino on Catalina Island, Frary Dining Hall and adjacent residence halls at Pomona College, and Greenacres, the estate of silent movie actor Harold Lloyd in Beverly Hills. He and architect Sumner Spaulding collaborated in the design of the Atkinson residence in Bel Air, which was modeled after the Petit Trianon at Versailes. As construction declined during the Great Depression, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Duell in 1936 to design the set of the Capulet home in Irving Thalberg's production of Romeo and Juliet. In 1937, he joined the MGM art department in a full-time capacity. During his career as a motion picture art director, he was nominated for three Academy Awards in the category Best Art Direction. He received screen credit for his work on 38 films, among them Ninotchka (1939), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946), Intruder in the Dust (1949), and Singin' in the Rain (1952). Additionally he worked on a number of motion pictures without film credit, among them The Wizard of Oz, 1939. He retired from MGM in 1959. During much of his career at MGM, Duell maintained an outside architectural practice and designed residential and commercial buildings in Southern California. Notable among his designs during this period is Casa de Cadillac, a car dealership in Sherman Oaks built in 1948 which is now considered a prime example of Googie architecture. Following his departure from MGM in 1959, he joined Marco Engineering and collaborated with C. V. Wood and Wade Rubottom in the design of Freedomland U.S.A. in The Bronx, the first of many theme parks he would design. At Freedomland, Duell designed many of the park structures and specified the color scheme for the Santa Fe Rail Road and other areas of the park. He is featured in the book, Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History (Theme Park Press, 2019). The following year, Duell left Marco Engineering and established R. Duell and Associates, a Santa Monica-based architectural practice which specialized in the design of theme parks. Marrying traditional architecture with stagecraft, the firm designed most of the country's theme parks. The list of projects included Six Flags Over Texas, Arlington, TX; Marriott's Great America parks in Gurnee, IL (now Six Flags Great America), and Santa Clara, CA (now California's Great America); the Universal Studios Tour, Universal City, CA; the Texas Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair in New York; Six Flags Magic Mountain, Valencia, CA; Opryland, Nashville, TN; Six Flags AstroWorld, Houston, TX; Hersheypark Hershey, PA; Carowinds, Charlotte, NC; and others. The Duell office employed the talents of a number of former motion picture art directors and theme park designers, among them Robert H Branham, Leroy Coleman, John DeCuir, John DeCuir, Jr., Roger Duell, Paul Saunders, Ira West, Harry Webster, Art Pieper, and Paul Groesse. Duell was inducted into the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Hall of Fame in 1993.

Early life and background Mary Sullivan was a doting mother who supported her only son Tommy throughout his professional boxing career. In Joseph Barboza's autobiography Barboza, Sullivan is wrongly identified as \\"Rocky\\", not \\"Tommy\\". Thomas was known in the neighborhood as a \\"tough puncher\\" who later went to work as a longshoreman in Boston, Massachusetts and lived with his mother on East Fifth Street. Even after his boxing career finished he remained physically fit from working as a longshoreman on the Boston waterfront and sparred at a gym to stay in shape. After his murder not far from the front steps of his house on East Fifth Street, Mary was overcome with emotional distress and shock and confined herself to her bed. She died soon afterward, at eighty-three. A newspaper quoted neighbors as saying that her son's murder would \\"kill her.\\" She was too grief-stricken and emotionally distraught to attend his funeral at Gates of Heaven Parish located at 615 East Fourth Street. Boxing career At the age of twenty, Tommy started his career as a professional boxer. He was a local celebrity in South Boston. On March 17, 1942 Tommy had his first professional boxing match against Johnny Lawless in Portland, Maine. During this match Lawless retired in his corner after the second round, due to a laceration over his eye that he received from Sullivan. On June 9, 1942 he fought Dave Hoblitzel in Portland, Maine. The bout with Hoblitzel was the boxing match that brought up allegations of corruption. On March 18, 1946 he fought against Jimmy Fields in Boston, Massachusetts. Fields fought the fight against Sullivan under the ring moniker \\"John Henry Eskew\\". Before a large crowd totaling 10,817, Eskew dropped Sullivan for a count of two in the second round. Following the knockdown, an angry Sullivan continued on and gave Eskew a brutal beating over the next two rounds. He left Fields draped over the ropes in the fourth round and won by a technical knockout. On October 14, 1946 he fought George Kochan at the Mechanics Building in Boston. During the fight he was knocked down twice before coming back to stop Kochan. This was considered \\"a savage slugging match.\\" On December 14, 1946 Tommy was matched up against Al Priest in Boston. This was the largest gate ever attracted at an indoor boxing match in Boston up to that time. 13,250 spectators attended the sport, the ring accumulated $59,944 in total. On July 15, 1946 Tommy fought Anthony Jones. The referee stopped the fight with Jones reeling about the ring helplessly. Jones was winning at the end of the sixth round, but Sullivan dropped him a 9-count in round seven, and launched a \\"hurricane attack\\" in the eighth which caused the fight to be stopped. On June 2, 1947 he fought against Coley Welch. He successfully knocked down Welch twice in the third round and one in the seventh round. His last professional fight was on January 21, 1949 against Johnny Carter in Worcester, Massachusetts. He fought with an orthodox stance and boxed 143 rounds over the span of his short career winning twenty of them with fourteen knock outs and two losses. Thomas was considered by many to be one of the more successful boxers that came out of Boston during that time period, more than Edward G. Connors, Anthony Veranis, Rocco DiSiglio and Americo Sacramone. Barroom brawl with Edward McLaughlin Thomas had resentment and anger towards the McLaughlin gang, and the gang leader George McLaughlin who had attempted to extort one of his close friends for money in early December. This infuriated him to no end. Two weeks before he was murdered, he made the mistake of getting into a vicious bar room brawl with Edward McLaughlin. By mob associates it was considered a good battle because both McLaughlin and Sullivan were ex-professionals, but Sullivan had a more successful bout than McLaughlin and had been a main event celebrity fighter. Edward hit Sullivan from behind with what may have been a length of iron pipe, knocking him to the floor. The fight played out in the barroom and then made its way out into the street. Edward, now badly beaten, finally gave up and rolled under a car parked in the street to get away. Tommy was relentless in his attack on the gangster, that much is certain. What is less certain is the claim that he lifted up one end of the car and propped one of the wheels up on the curb allowing him access to McLaughlin. Gangland slaying On December 22, 1957 Tommy was shot and killed on East Fifth Street as he was making his way back to work. During the initial murder investigation, homicide detectives became quickly convinced that his murder was related to disturbances on the waterfront that involved out-of-town racketeers. Two suspects, including Edward McLaughlin were brought in for questioning about the murder. One provided an airtight alibi clearing him of any suspicion in the murder while McLaughlin remained under suspicion. The case eventually went cold and no one was ever charged or convicted in the murder of Sullivan. Howie Carr states that Sullivan's killer was Harold Hannon. Hannon was later murdered in the ensuing Irish Mob wars. Harold was garroted with piano wire and had his corpse tossed into the Boston Harbor on August 20, 1964. Sullivan's bar brawling foe Edward McLaughlin was shot dead at a bus stop in West Roxbury, Massachusetts in October 1965.

A former member of Special Service Group, he was credited with masterminding the Angoor Ada operation in 2004, where many Arabs and Chechens based in the tribal areas were killed or arrested and turned over to the Americans.Hamid Mir. \\"How an ex-Army commando became a terrorist\\" The News, 20 September 2009 On 19 November 2008, while driving to work in his car in Islamabad, he was shot dead by three unknown gunmen. It was alleged that Ilyas Kashmiri, the chief of Jammu & Kashmir chapter of Harkat-ul-Jihad-al- Islami,Amir Mir. \\"Ilyas Kashmiri had planned to attack COAS\\" The News, 18 September 2009 was behind the murder of Maj-Gen Faisal Alavi at the behest of the Taliban in North Waziristan. Early life Alavi was born and raised in Kenya during his childhood (which at that time was a British colony) as a British national. His parents had migrated to the country from Pakistan. In 1966 at the age of 12, he moved to Pakistan to study at Abbottabad Public School where he studied from 1966 to 1971. Out of his love and zeal for the military he renounced his British nationality. He got his Pakistani citizenship when he wrote to then President of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to be granted citizenship in order to be able to join the Pakistan Army.\\"Maj-Gen Amir Faisal Alavi‚Äôs daughter remembers him\\" The News, 22 November 2008 He thus renounced his British nationality to join Pakistan Army. He was commissioned in the 49th PMA Long Course in 1974 in the 26th Cavalry Regiment of the Armoured Corps. Family Maj Gen Alavi has two daughters who live in with their mother but at the time of his death they were both in USA.

In August 2005, however, he was sacked by General Pervez Musharraf from his post as head of Pakistan's Special Service Group (SSG), for \\"conduct unbecoming.\\" Carey Schofield, writing for the British newspaper The Sunday Times, reported that there was a plot by Major General Faisal Alavi's enemies using an affair with a divorced Pakistani woman to discredit him. While having a conversation with his colleagues he was challenged on the issue, Faisal Alavi made a remark considered disrespectful to General Pervez Musharraf, then the president. Some of his enemies played the recording of this conversation to General Musharraf and Faisal Alavi was sacked.Carey Schofield. \\"UK may help find Pakistani general‚Äôs killers\\" The Sunday Times, 14 December 2008 Post-retirement years After his retirement he worked as CEO and Executive Director of REDtone Telecommunication Pakistan Ltd, a privately held telecommunications company in Pakistan. He, however, continued to make efforts to clear his name from the allegations made against him that lead to his sacking. He wanted his honour to be restored and to be given then Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Military) or the Crescent of Excellence, a medal he would have been given had he not been dismissed. Assassination On 19 November 2008, while driving to work in his car, he was shot dead by three unknown gunmen on Islamabad Highway near the PWD Colony in the Koral police precincts, close to his home in Bahria Town.Mohammad Asghar and Munawer Azeem. \\"Gunmen kill retired general in Rawalpindi shooting\\" Dawn, 19 November 2008 Earlier on 21 July 2008, General Faisal Alavi had sent a letter to the chief of Pakistan Army, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, requesting to restore his benefits and suggesting that two army general officers had plotted to get him expelled from the army because they wanted to hide their involvement in \\"a matter he was privy to\\". He had threatened to expose Pakistani army generals who he believed had made deals with Taliban militants and warned that he would \\"furnish all relevant proof.\\" In October 2008, risking his life, he gave a copy of this letter to Carey Schofield in Talkingfish Islamabad restaurant which was also his favorite. When he did not get a reply from General Kayani he was concerned for his life and mentioned that to Schofield in a conversation, \\"It hasn't worked, They'll shoot me.\\" Four days after his conversation with the British journalist while he was driving through Islamabad his car was halted by another vehicle and the gunmen opened fire from either side. He was shot eight times. His driver was also killed. The gunmen had used 9 mm pistols, a standard army issue, and the killings were believed to be \\"far more clinical than a normal militant attack\\" giving rise to speculation of involvement of Pakistani Army personnel in the murder. = Revelations to Carey Schofield and British SAS= In August 2005 while visiting Hereford, the home of the Special Air Service (SAS) he was keen to revive the SSG's relationship with British special forces and expressed unhappiness about the way some elements of Pakistan's army were behaving. He wanted kit, skills and training from the UK for the SSG. When he was bluntly asked by an SAS officer why the Pakistani army should be given all this help if nothing came of it in terms of getting the Al-Qaeda leadership, he replied \\"he knew that Pakistan was not pulling its weight in the war on terror.\\" He told Carey Schofield how one general had done a deal with Baitullah Mehsud, the 35-year-old Taliban leader. Mehsud, was the main suspect in the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. He was also believed to have been behind a plot to bomb transport networks in several European countries including Britain, which came to light when 14 alleged conspirators were arrested in Barcelona. He revealed that a senior Pakistani general came to an arrangement with Mehsud \\"whereby ‚Äì in return for a large sum of money ‚Äì Mehsud's 3,000 armed fighters would not attack the army.\\" Carey Schofield later reported that Faisal Alavi had suggested that two senior generals named in Faisal Alavi's letter to Kayani were in effect complicit in giving the militants free rein in return for refraining from attacks on the Pakistani army. =Role of Ilyas Kashmiri= The editorial in Daily Times claimed that Maj (Retd) Haroon Ashiq was the assassin of Maj-Gen Faisal Alavi \\"for Rs 150,000 given him by [Ilyas] Kashmiri.\\" This was consistent with Interior Minister Rehman Malik's statement on television in August 2009 that \\"officers of the rank of major\\" in the intelligence agencies with links with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had been arrested \\"because they wanted to target army generals.\\"\\"Second Editorial: Ilyas Kashmiri‚Äôs death\\" Daily Times, 18 September 2009 Ilyas Kashmiri was reportedly killed in a US drone attack in Waziristan on September 7, 2009, but survived and remains at large. He had reorganized 313 Brigade in North Waziristan (it was earlier active in Kashmir before 9/11) that was responsible for carrying out multiple terrorist attacks throughout the country. It had 3000 fighters in its ranks including many former Pakistan Army officers. Earlier Kashmiri was arrested after the twin attacks on President General Pervez Musharraf in December 2003, but was later released in February 2004 at the insistence of United Jihad Council led by Sayeed Salahudeen. Funeral He was buried at the army graveyard in Rawalpindi a few days after his assassination. Soldiers had come from across Pakistan to bury the general with military honours. Wreaths were laid on behalf of Kayani and most of the country's military leadership. After his death he was described by his daughter to a Pakistani newspaper as an \\"easy going, humble, compassionate, but very fearless\\" person.

Ernst Heinrich was the youngest son of the last King of Saxony, Frederick Augustus III, and his wife Archduchess Luise of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. From 1923 through 1945, Ernst Heinrich was Administrative Chief of the association \\"Haus Wettin ‚Äì Albertinische Linie e.V.\\". Life Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony spent his childhood in Dresden, Pillnitz, and Moritzburg under the parenting of his father. The loss of his mother, who left the family permanently in 1902, affected his father and siblings very deeply, according to their own statements. Ernst Heinrich, who was only six at the time, was possibly the child who felt this loss most. = World War I = Prince Ernst Heinrich in 1906 When World War I broke out, Ernest Heinrich was first lieutenant in the 1st Royal Saxon Leib-Grenadier- Regiment Nr. 100. In September 1914, he became batman in the General Kommando of XIX (2nd Royal Saxon) Corps at Reims and Lille. He did his Abitur during a four-month leave in 1916, then took part in the Battle of the Somme as a member of the staff of the 24th Reserve Division. On 30 August 1916, Ernst Heinrich received the Military Order of St. Henry for merit. In the spring of 1917, he took over the leadership of the 9th Company of Reserve-Infantry Regiment No. 104 in Berezhany (in eastern Galicia). He was in the hospital for two months in 1917, after which he commanded the 9th Battery of Artillery Regiment No. 115 in the area around Ypres. Beginning in May 1918, he led the 1st Squadron of Mounted Guard Regiments in Stary Bychow at Dnieper in Russia and, in August of the same year, he was in charge of the Saxon troops in Dorpat, Reval and Finland. In November and December 1918, Ernst Heinrich oversaw the return of Saxon troops to Germany. = 1920s = In 1919 and 1920, Ernst Heinrich learned to administer a manor in Silesia. During the Kapp Putsch in March 1920, he acted as a liaison between the putschists in Berlin and the Reichswehr in Wroc≈Çaw. After the failure of the putsch, he moved to Munich, where he joined the circle around the former Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria. He married on 12 April 1921 in the Nymphenburg Palace to Sophie (14 February 1902 - 24 May 1941), the youngest sister of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and of Rupprecht's wife Princess Antonia of Luxembourg. This was considered a happy marriage; they had three sons. Ernst Heinrich did not participate in the Beer Hall Putsch on 8 and 9 November 1923 in Munich. He rejected the Nazi ideology consistently and distanced himself from Hitler and Ludendorff. At his father's request, he took over the function of head of the administration of the association House of Wettin -- Albertinische Linie e.V. His father also gave him power of attorney to negotiate with the Free State of Saxony about the future use of the manors owned by the Wettin family and their art collection. On 25 June 1925, a treaty was signed between the Free State and its former ruling dynasty, regulating the relation between the House of Wettin and the Free State, within the context of the law on the subject of 9 July 1924. In subsequent years, Ernst Heinrich, who was an avid art lover, made several trips to Egypt with his wife and children. In 1928/29, he was approached by Gustav Stresemann of the DVP (the German People's Party), who wanted Ernst Heinrich to stand as a candidate for the federal presidency. Ernst Heinrich considered this a hopeless undertaking and declined. = Nazi era = Ernst Heinrich opposed the Nazis after they formed a government on 30 January 1933. However, he failed to read the political situation correctly. He believed that Hitler could be stopped by the conservative political opposition and, in the spring of 1933, he joined Der Stahlhelm, hoping he could escape the influence of the Nazis. On 1 July 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives, he was arrested. He was interned in the concentration camp in Hohnstein for five days. After his release, Ernst Heinrich retired to Moritzburg Castle in Saxony. He was an avid hunter and had to keep in touch with Nazi leaders such as Hermann G√∂ring, who, as Master of the Hunt, was interested in the forests owned by the Wettins, and Martin Mutschmann, the Nazi governor of Saxony. In 1938, he received King Carol II of Romania in his castle, and in 1939 he had extensive political discussions with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who had been mayor of Leipzig and was later active in the German resistance. A few weeks before the outbreak of World War II, Ernst Heinrich was drafted into the Abwehr group IV in Dresden. In 1943, he openly expressed doubts that the death of his brother Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony had been an accident. The Gestapo then arrested and questioned him. However, there were no further personal consequences, as the Nazis were still reluctant to confront a member of a former royal family. Ernst Heinrich was an admirer of the art of K√§the Kollwitz. After she lost her home when Berlin was bombed in 1943, he invited her to move to Moritzburg, where she lived and worked at the Rudenhof in the immediate vicinity of the castle, until she died in April 1945. In February 1945, nearby Dresden was bombed. In March 1945, Ernst Heinrich fled to Sigmaringen to escape the advancing Red Army. Before he left, Ernst Heinrich and his sons buried most of their valuables in 40 crates in the K√∂nigswald forest. Most of this treasure was found by the Red Army and carried off to the Soviet Union. However, three crates full of treasure were rediscovered in 1995. = After the war = In 1947, Ernst Heinrich married the actress Virginia Dulon (1910‚Äì2002), who styled herself Princess Virginia of Saxony after her marriage. Later that year, he purchased the Coolamber estate in Lismacaffrey (County Westmeath) in Ireland and moved there with his second wife and his sons from his first marriage. He died in Neckarhausen while visiting Germany in 1971. Marriages and issue Ernst Heinrich was first married to Princess Sophie of Luxembourg, sixth and youngest daughter of William IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and his wife Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, on 12 April 1921 at Schloss Hohenburg. Ernst Heinrich and Sophie had three sons: *Prince Albrecht Friedrich August Johannes Gregor Dedo of Saxony (born 9 May 1922 in Munich; died 6 December 2009 in Radebeul, Germany).Wettiner prinz Dedo ist tot Never married or had issue. *Prince Georg Timo Michael Nikolaus Maria of Saxony (born 22 December 1923 in Munich; died 22 April 1982 in Emden).

Some archaeologists have identified the Tilaurakot archeological site as the location for the historical site of Kapilavastu, while others claim it was 16 km away at Piprahwa in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Tilaurakot was discovered by PC Mukherji in 1899 tracing the journey of those two Chinese monks following the history, they were visited Tilaurakot in the 3rd and 6th centuries AD. Archeologists believe that it was the civic center from 9th century BC to 3rd Century AD. Experts have discovered the palaces, temples, monuments, sculptures, ponds, roads and it has already proved that the place was the capital of Shakya Kingdom and home town of Lord Buddha. Some of the objects found during the excavation are kept in Kapilvastu Museum near the Tilaurakot which is being displayed for the visitors. UNESCO Tentative Listed Site Archaeological excavation is still going on as of now at Tilaurakot but it has already proved that Tilaurakot was the ancient palace of King Suddhodhana, father of Lord Buddha. Three palaces are already explored by excavation and other palaces are under excavation which will discover more parts of the entire city and many more of Art, Architecture, life, and the pride of the ancestors. Furthermore, all the concerned parties are hoping this final excavation will help getting listed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites as it was already listed as a UNESCO tentative site in 1996 by the Nepalese government.

The film follows married couple Joanna Reed (Keira Knightley) and Michael Reed (Sam Worthington), who are tempted by different forms of infidelity when they spend a night apart following a fight. Joanna is emotionally drawn to her ex-boyfriend Alex Mann (Guillaume Canet) while Michael is physically attracted to his co-worker Laura Nunez (Eva Mendes). The cast includes Griffin Dunne, Daniel Eric Gold, Anson Mount, Stephanie Romanov, Scott Adsit, Justine Cotsonas, and Chriselle Almeida. Last Night was produced by Entertainment One in association with the Gaumont Film Company, and deals with questions about emotional and physical infidelity. The film was developed as a romance and suspense story before Tadjedin recognized its moral significance. After persuading Knightley to break a year-long acting hiatus to participate in the film, Tadjedin cast the other roles with consideration for the actors' chemistry. Mendes originally turned down the role of Laura but agreed to appear in the film after a conversation with Tadjedin. Scenes were filmed in SoHo, Manhattan, between 2008 and 2009 with Peter Deming as the director of photography. The soundtrack was composed by Clint Mansell, who received a World Soundtrack Award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year for his work. Miramax Films initially bought Last Night for a March 19, 2010 release, but it was delayed by the company's closure. The film was shown at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2010 Rome Film Festival. It premiered theatrically in France on February 16, 2011, and had a limited release in the United States on May 6, 2011. It was also released through video on demand. Critics were divided over the film's plot and its commentary on infidelity; Deming's cinematography and performances from Knightley, Canet, and Mendes received praise while Worthington and the scenes between Michael and Laura were the subject of criticism. Last Night grossed $7.7 million primarily from foreign markets.  Plot Joanna, a writer, and Michael Reed, a commercial real estate agent, are a married couple who share an apartment in New York City. During a party with Michael's colleagues, Joanna notices him spending time with Laura Nunez, an attractive co-worker, and wonders why he has not previously mentioned her. Joanna suspects Michael is having an affair and confronts him about it when they return home. They have an argument but reconcile later that night. The following day, Michael leaves on a business trip to Philadelphia with his associates Laura and Andy; Joanna stays behind to work on a novel. Joanna meets her ex-boyfriend Alex Mann; they go to a bar later that day, have a dinner with two of Alex's friends, Sandra and Truman, and they discuss their past relationship and Joanna's marriage to Michael; she has never told Michael about Alex. Joanna and Alex return to Andy's apartment, where they talk about their previous romance, having got back together after Michael briefly broke off his relationship with Joanna. She goes out to walk Andy's dog; he accidentally locks them outside. They go to a party with Sandra, Truman, and the dog. Joanna and Alex grow closer over the course of the night, and they eventually kiss. After the party, they return to Alex's hotel room. Joanna refuses to have sex with Alex and they instead spend the night embracing each other in bed. The next day, Joanna and Alex kiss before he leaves New York broken-hearted. Scenes depicting Joanna's night with Alex are interspersed with scenes showing Michael and Laura. After having dinner with a client, Laura invites Michael out for drinks at the hotel bar. Michael tells her he has never cheated on his wife. They go to the hotel pool, where they strip to their underwear and swim together. They return to Laura's room and have sex. The following morning, Michael discovers a note from Joanna in which she apologizes for their fight and says she trusts him. Feeling guilty, Michael leaves Philadelphia early. Laura and Andy give their presentation to their clients without him. Upon returning to their apartment, Michael finds Joanna crying. They make plans for the day in an attempt to resume their normal lives. They embrace and he says that he loves her. Joanna is puzzled by Michael's sudden show of affection and early return from work. Michael notices that Joanna left out a pair of expensive shoes from the night before and that she is wearing her sexiest underwear. The film ends as Joanna prepares to speak.  Cast  The cast includes: * Keira Knightley as Joanna Reed * Sam Worthington as Michael Reed * Eva Mendes as Laura Nunez * Guillaume Canet as Alex Mann * Daniel Eric Gold as Andy * Anson Mount as Neal * Griffin Dunne as Truman * Stephanie Romanov as Sandra * Scott Adsit as Stuart * Justine Cotsonas as Maggie * Rae Ritke as Barbara * Chriselle Almeida as Chris  Production  = Development = Massy Tadjedin wrote and filmed Last Night, which was her directorial debut after writing the screenplays for the films Leo (2002) and The Jacket (2005). She completed the script roughly four and a half years prior to its release; she developed the scenes out of sequence and wrote them with Microsoft Word. Tadjedin said she struggled with writing characters that \\"would come across as real people, that their struggle was believable\\". After a negative response from a Warner Bros. studio executive on the script's formatting, she realized Final Draft was the preferred software for screenwriters. In early drafts, the story was set between Los Angeles and New Mexico; the setting was later changed to New York City, which Tadjedin described as a \\"place where the diverse characters could come together\\". She clarified that the location change did not affect the plot. because she wanted to portray the characters' relationships in a more universal context rather than tied to a specific city. Requesting seven million dollars for production, she had difficulty with financing the film, and rejected a potential source for not understanding her \\"artistic vision\\". The Los Angeles Times partially attributed the difficulty in selling Last Night to a film studio to it being an adult drama, which it described as \\"endangered in Hollywood\\". Tadjedin initially pictured Last Night as a romance or a thriller film, but later realized its commentary on infidelity while assembling the cast and crew. Monogamy was also identified by some media outlets as a topic explored in the movie. Tadjedin likened Last Night to a slice of life story, a genre that she enjoyed in her childhood, while Griffin Dunne identified it more as a \\"moral thriller\\" due to its focus on \\"a universal passage in a long-term relationship\\". Critics compared the storyline and characters to those of a Woody Allen film, such as The Globe and Mail calling it \\"a New York morality play\\" set in Allen's \\"emotional and physical terrain\\". The Ottawa Sun described the tone as being \\"vaguely European-feeling\\" and \\"cosmopolitan\\". = Casting = alt=An image of Eva Mendes looking toward the camera while signing a paper. According to Tadjedin, the casting was \\"very chemistry dependent\\" to ensure each relationship felt authentic. She said the addition of Keira Knightley had \\"anchored the casting process\\". Knightley and Tadjedin became friends following their collaboration on The Jacket. When asked if she had written Joanna for Knightley, Tadjedin said she imagined the character as a cross between Natalie Wood and Julie Christie instead. Last Night was Knightley's first project after she had a mental breakdown at the age of 22 and took a hiatus in 2009; Knightley said her return to acting had helped improve her mental health. Tadjedin persuaded Knightley to be a part of Last Night while visiting her in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. Knightley said that she was drawn to the film's commentary on physical versus emotional infidelity. When asked about her approach to Joanna, she said that she relied on her imagination and empathy for the character, clarifying she was not a method actress. During a 2018 interview with Peter Travers, Knightley cited Last Night as one of four films that meant the most to her; she enjoyed it for the collaboration with the cast and crew and the more naturalistic style of acting. Tadjedin approached the male leads based on how their chemistry with Knightley. After watching Sam Worthington in the 2004 film Somersault, Tadjedin sent him the script for Last Night, and met with him on-set for the 2009 film Avatar. She hired the actor due to his \\"great sympathy for the character of Michael\\" and her impression that he would have a \\"a great married chemistry\\" with Knightley. Tadjedin approached Guillaume Canet about his role during a screening of his 2006 film Tell No One. Lines were cut from scenes between Knightley and Canet to focus on \\"their tension from looks\\". Tadjedin said that she wanted to represent the characters' anxiety through movement rather than dialogue. Eva Mendes was cast for Laura based on the warmth she brought to the character. Initially reluctant to join the project, Mendes worried the character would \\"lack originality\\" and be \\"too seductive\\". She agreed to the part after meeting with Tadjedin, and said: \\"It was great to connect with a female director and talk about this woman and not objectify her as the other woman but give her a real true life and make her honest‚Ä¶. Thank God I did.\\" Tadjedin emphasized that Laura was not written as a \\"homewrecker\\" or a \\"temptress\\". = Filming and post-production = Filming took place in SoHo, Manhattan and occurred between 2008 and 2009. During production, Last Night was known as Tell Me.Hischak (2015): p. 442 The location for Michael and Joanna's Tribeca apartment was found after a three-week search. Producers required a space with an elevator and enough room to accommodate a filming crew. Tadjedin wanted the apartment's furniture to represent the characters' personalities and the state of their relationship because the film does not depict their histories. She intended to portray Michael and Joanna as \\"a successful working couple\\" rather than \\"a very rarefied couple in New York\\", though she settled for the larger set due to time constraints. In reference to the film's overall look, she wanted to represent everyday life in downtown New York. The actors used their natural accents for the characters, a decision Worthington had attributed to New York's identification as a melting pot. He asked Tadjedin to remove a line referencing Michael and Joanna taking a flight home, saying, \\"Don't fuckin' have me explain why I'm from Australia\\". Tadjedin explained that the international cast was not intentional, but said that \\"it felt really organic\\". While the cast was composed of actors of multiple nationalities, the crew was entirely American. During production, the cast and crew discussed their views on infidelity and shared their personal experiences with each other. The film was developed by Entertainment One in association with the Gaumont Film Company; its final cut runs for 92 minutes. The Gaumont Film Company financed Last Night, helped to release it in France, and handled sales. Gaumont CEO Christophe Riandee said the company acquired the movie to prove its \\"determination to go forward with high-end English-speaking productions\\". Tadjedin produced the film with Nick Wechsler and Sidonie Dumas. Wechsler had previously attempted to put Tadjedin's other scripts into production. Christophe Riandee and Buddy Enright were the executive producers, and Satsuki Mitchell was a co-producer. Susan E. Morse edited the film and the production design was handled by Tim Grimes. Peter Deming worked as the movie's director of photography, and Ann Roth created the costumes.  Soundtrack  Clint Mansell composed the soundtrack for Last Night, and Peter Broderick wrote lyrics and provided vocals for certain parts. Following a request from Tadjedin, Broderick re-recorded his song \\"Not At Home\\" with Mansell for the film's final scene. Uncut described the music as \\"a step outside [of Mansell's] usual mixture of intense orchestral post-rock and intense moodiness\\"; according to Thomson the soundtrack is composed primarily of \\"melancholy piano pieces\\". Mansell said he felt the piano had a \\"sort of hypnotic\\" sound on the tracks. Milan Records and Warner Classics released the soundtrack on an audio CD and as a digital download on March 27, 2012. Critics praised to the soundtrack, and Mansell was nominated for a World Soundtrack Award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year. The nomination was also for his music for the 2010 films Black Swan and Faster. HuffPost wrote Mansell created \\"a haunting score\\" that \\"lingers long after the film is over\\". Uncut praised the soundtrack as \\"a slight collection, but excellent for all that\\", although IndieWire criticized it as \\"mostly played out in the forgettable background\\". The film also prominently features Explosions in the Sky's \\"So Long, Lonesome\\", which is not included on the soundtrack.  Release and box office  During the third week of its production, Miramax Films purchased Last Night for distribution. Originally set for a March 19, 2010 release, it was postponed following the company's closure. The Walt Disney Company, the parent company of Miramax Films, was initially \\"unwilling to do anything with the film for fear of stepping on the toes of Miramax's eventual buyer\\", but later allowed it to be shown at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, where it premiered as the closing film. Collider considered it to be \\"one of the more under-reported films\\". According to CinemaBlend.com, the film received a positive response from the festival's audience. The film's distribution rights were acquired by Tribeca Film. Last Night was shown as the opener for the 2010 Rome Film Festival; the cast was unable to walk the red carpet for the movie due to protests by the Centoautori movement. The protest was held in response to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's decision to stop tax exemptions for film productions and reduce funds for cultural events. As part of the festival, the film was one of sixteen nominated for the Golden Marc'Aurelio Award. A preview of the movie was released online in March 2011. Last Night first premiered theatrically in France on February 16, 2011, and was made available on video on demand on April 20, 2011. The film had a limited release in ten US theaters on May 6, 2011, where it received an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America due to language and sexuality. Prior to its theatrical premiere in 2011, Tadjedin and Deming received nominations for their directorial and cinematography work at the 2010 Camerimage awards. Grossing $29,505 on its opening weekend, Last Night went on to earn $7,743,923 worldwide; $98,986 in the US and $7,644,937 from foreign markets. The film was removed from US theaters on June 2, 2011; it was later released in other countries between 2011 and 2017 through different distributors. It grossed the most ($2,386,504) in France and the least ($3,026) in New Zealand, following its premiere there on October 12, 2017. Last Night was released on home video and streaming services on August 1, 2011; it was made available on iTunes and Netflix. The film was later packaged as part of the Echo Bridge Home Entertainment release Epic Romances with Anna Karenina (1948), As You Like It (1936), The Magic Sword (1962), and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946).  Critical reception  The film's commentary on infidelity received mixed reviews. Tadjedin was praised for not supporting or antagonizing Joanna or Michael. DVD Talk commended Tadjedin for not reducing the characters to \\"the monsters and angels normally created for cinematic takes on infidelity\\". In an Entertainment Weekly review, Owen Gleiberman liked that the film examined infidelity beyond only sex, and Den of Geek! said it avoided common pitfalls in the chick flick genre. Despite giving the film a positive review, Hot Press wrote that the effectiveness of its message was entirely \\"dependent on the viewer's own experiences\\". Other reviewers criticized the lead characters as boring, including some questioning why the plot was worth caring about. The Hollywood Reporter summed up the film's message by asking: \\"Although the real question, is who cares?\\". Slant Magazine panned Last Night as \\"a tale of two featureless, well-off nobodies\\", and Digital Spy criticized it as a \\"mostly hollow experience\\" with a \\"distinct lack of flesh on the plot's bare bones\\". Last Night's plot and characters were described as lacking the \\"appetite for lunatic adventure\\" of Woody Allen's works, or the emotional stakes of the 2009 film I Am Love. Despite their negative reviews of the overall film, The Japan Times and Politico praised its ending for its ambiguity; Politico described the final scene as an \\"unconventional and exciting moment\\" comparable to the jump cuts in the 1992 film Husbands and Wives. alt=An image of Keira Knightley smiling toward the camera. Deming's cinematography was praised. HuffPost described the film as set in \\"a dazzlingly stylish New York\\", and Den of Geek! said the \\"luscious and sensuous\\" cinematography matched the sexual tension throughout the movie. Despite its criticisms of the actors' performances, Politico praised Last Night for its \\"romantic atmosphere of the cobblestones of Tribeca\\". IndieWire commended Deming's direction, but said it is a \\"poor solution for what the narrative lacks\\". Critics highlighted Knightley, Canet, and Mendes for their performances. Filmmaker said Knightley provided \\"a layered portrayal of a woman at a crossroads she doesn‚Äôt know she‚Äôs at\\", and The A.V. Club likened it to a \\"Michelle Williams-style moodiness\\". Interview cited her delivery of the line \\"What I wouldn‚Äôt give to have tired of you\\" as an example of her \\"quietly devastating performance\\". Despite finding Joanna unsympathetic, The Japan Times praised Knightley's ability to convey pain on screen. Filmmaker singled out Canet and Mendes for creating \\"original beats in their roles as possible paramours\\"; The Hollywood Reporter preferred their characters over Joanna and Michael. Mendes was praised as \\"particularly appealing\\" by Variety, and for \\"resisting the urge to overdo (and overvamp) her role the way a lesser actress would\\" by DVD Talk. Some critics attributed Mendes' character and performance as her way of avoiding typecasting related to her appearance. On the other hand, Politico criticized Canet for appearing more \\"creepy and presumptuous rather than romantic and sad\\". Worthington received criticism for his performance. DVD Talk cited his \\"dull and lifeless\\" acting as the film's main problem, and Slant Magazine noted his \\"idea of underplaying is to go blank\\". Politico criticized both Worthington and Knightley for being too \\"tepid\\" and not realizing their roles' potential. Michael's storyline with Laura was also poorly received, particularly in comparison to the scenes between Joanna and Alex. IndieWire did not believe Tadjedin established enough why Michael and Laura have sex beyond a shared physical attraction. Criticizing Worthington and Mendes as lacking chemistry, The Globe and Mail wrote that the pool scene was \\"ridiculously prim\\" and Laura was too \\"tired and remote\\" with Michael. Other critics said the film was too unbalanced, preferring Joanna over Michael. Den of Geek! wanted the story to be \\"a little more even-handed towards Michael's character\\", and The Boston Globe wished Tadjedin was more \\"generous with the rest of the cast as she is with Knightley\\".

Screenplay was written by Alfred Hayes. It is based on the novel of the same name by A. B. Guthrie Jr. Filming took place in Sierra de √ìrganos National Park in the town of Sombrerete, Mexico The plot involves a sheltered rancher brought up under the stern gaze of his Bible-thumping father. Plot Albert Gallatin \\"Lat\\" Evans (Don Murray), an earnest young cowboy determined to better his situation, wins a job with a cattle drive by busting a wild horse. Befriended by cowhand Tom Ping (Stuart Whitman), Lat fantasizes about owning his own ranch and being rich one day, unlike his father, who died \\"broke, a failure.\\" When the drive reaches a small Wyoming town, the cowboys congregate at the saloon, where Jehu (Richard Egan), an unscrupulous rancher, proposes racing one of their horses against his swift steed. Lat accepts the challenge, and is in the lead when his opponent throws a blanket at his face, causing Lat to lose his balance and fall from his horse. Marshal Conrad (Albert Dekker), the town's upstanding banker, intervenes, however, and declares Lat the winner. That night, Tom and Lat celebrate with saloon girls Jen (Jean Willes) and Callie (Lee Remick). With their winnings, they decide to leave the cattle drive and hunt wolves for their hides. After bidding his cowhand friends goodbye, Lat, feeling melancholy, gets drunk and visits Callie. When Lat recalls a traumatic incident from his childhood in which his father beat him for being alone with a girl in the woodshed, Callie feels empathy. Restless and impatient to become successful, Lat asks Conrad for a loan to buy a ranch. After Conrad turns him down, Callie gives Lat her life savings to buy a piece of land, which he then uses as collateral for a loan from Conrad to purchase a herd of cattle. Lat makes Tom a partner in the venture, and after a hard winter, Lat prospers while the other ranchers falter, since he grew hay in the low lands to feed hay to the cattle in the winter. As his fortunes improve, Lat begins to shun Callie for Conrad's niece Joyce (Patricia Owens). When Tom tells Lat that he plans to marry Jen, Lat questions his decision and calls Jen a tramp, causing Tom to angrily renounce their partnership. One night, while Lat is dining at Conrad's, the banker proposes that he enter politics by running for the school board. Meanwhile, Callie, who has baked a cake for Lat, anxiously awaits his arrival, and when Jehu appears instead, she fights off his crude advances. After dinner, Joyce invites Lat to call on her if he is reputable. Lat goes to Callie's house and informs her that there is no place in his life for her. Soon after, Lat and Joyce are married and start a family. Jehu and Callie become lovers. When Lat decides to run for U.S. Senator, he is visited by Jehu and rancher Frank Chanault (Tom Greenway), who use the promise of their votes to coerce him into joining a group of rancher vigilantes on the trail of some horse thieves. The ranchers corner the thieves at their mountain hideout, and after a gun battle, the two surviving rustlers surrender, and Lat is shocked to discover that Tom is one of them. After Tom confesses, he accuses Lat of worshiping the tin god of money. Jehu sentences Tom to hang, and when Lat protests that he be allowed to stand trial, Jehu knocks him unconscious and then hangs Tom. Riddled with remorse, Lat returns home and Joyce hands him a distress note from Callie. Although Joyce jealousy forbids Lat to see Callie, Lat contends that he owes her a debt and proceeds to her house. There, Lat learns from her servant Happy (Ken Renard) that Jehu has savagely beaten Callie. Outraged, Lat goes in search of Jehu. After finding Jehu at the saloon, the two begin to fight and their brawl spills onto the street as the townsfolk watch in consternation. Pulling a rifle from a saddle, Jehu aims it at Lat just as a gunshot fired by Callie rings out, killing Jehu. Later, at home, Joyce forgives Lat, and when he informs her that he intends to testify at Callie's trial, she graciously gives her consent.

Variably deployable physiological processes relate mostly to processes that defend or clear infections as these are optional while also having high costs and circumstance linked benefits. They include immune system responses, fever, antioxidants and the plasma level of iron. Notable determining factors are life history stage, and resource availability. Immunity Activating the immune system has the present and future benefit of clearing infections, but it is also both expensive in regard to present high metabolic energy consumption, and in the risk of resulting in a future immune related disorder. Therefore, an adaptive advantage exists if an animal can control its deployment in regard to actuary-like evaluations of future benefits and costs as to its biological fitness. In many circumstances, such trade-off calculations explain why immune responses are suppressed and infections are tolerated. Circumstances where immunity is not activated due to lack of an actuarial benefit include: * Malnutrition * Old age * Hibernation * Parasitism (low or high risk) * Sexually transmitted diseases (low or high risk) * Light patterns associated with winter (probable resource shortage) Fever Cost benefit trade-off actuary issues apply to the antibacterial and antiviral effects of fever (increased body temperature). Fever has the future benefit of clearing infections since it reduces the replication of bacteria and viruses. But it also has great present metabolic (BMR) cost, and the risk of hyperpyrexia. Where it is achieved internally, each degree raise in blood temperature, raises BMR by 10‚Äì15%. 90% of the total cost of fighting pneumonia, goes, for example, on energy devoted to raising body temperature. During sepsis, the resulting fever can raise BMR by 55%‚Äîand cause a 15% to 30% loss of body mass. Circumstances in which fever deployment is not selected or is reduced include: * Aged individuals‚Äîthe burden of tolerating infection will exist for a short time which reduces the actuarial future benefits of clearing an infection compared to the costs of its removal. This change favors reduced or no deployment of fever. * When internal resources are limited (such as in winter), and the ability to afford high expenditure on increased metabolism is reduced. This increases the risks of activating fever relative to its potential benefit, and animals are less likely to use fever to fight infections. * Late Pregnancy Antioxidants Antioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin C, Vitamin E, and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) can protect against reactive oxygen species that damage DNA, proteins and lipids, and result in cell senescence and death. A cost exists in creating or obtaining these antioxidants. This creates a conflict between the biological fitness benefits of future survival compared with the use of these antioxidants to advantage present reproductive success. In some birds, antioxidants are diverted from maintaining the body to reproduction for this reason with the result that they have accelerated senescence Related to this, birds can show their biological capacity to afford the cost of diverting antioxidants (such as carotenoids) in the form of pigments into plumage as a costly signal. Hypoferremia Iron is vital to biological processes, not only of a host, but also to bacteria infecting the host. A biological fitness advantage can exist for hosts to reduce the availability of iron within itself to such bacteria (hypoferremia), even though this happens at a cost of the host impairing itself with anemia. The potential benefits of such self impairment is illustrated by the paradoxical effect that providing iron supplements to those with iron deficiency (which interferes with its antibacterial action) can result in an individual being cured of anemia but having increased bacterial illness.

It was founded in December 1995 and opened officially in November 1998. The premises are a former cinema that is a listed building. Operation The centre was founded in 1995 by the representative of the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ayatollah Sheikh Mohsen Araki, who was its first Director, and opened officially in November 1998. It describes itself as an educational centre for those who wish to increase their knowledge of Islamic principles and cultural values and therefore, helping to strengthen the social structure of the community. In addition to religious services, the centre provides counselling and support in all areas of family life. The Centre is run as a UK Private company limited by guarantee as Islamic centre of England Limited, notably its Governing Document requires that at all times one Trustee be a representative of an overseas government, the Supreme Leader of Iran. The financial accounts filed at Companies House show that as 31 December 2016 the Company has reserves (ie money in the bank or quickly accessible) of ¬£4.4M; and that during the year grants were passed to Islamic centres in Glasgow, Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds. Propagation of Islam is the main activity. The Islamic Centre of England has a daily congregation of 50-100 people. It is open 365 days a year and holds programmes in English, Arabic, Farsi and Urdu, while welcoming people who speak 57 languages. During major religious events the number of worshippers throughout the day exceeds 5,000. The Centre is led by 3 directors, one of whom is a woman. Abdul Hussein Mo'ezzi is a former director and imam. A representative of the church was involved with Benedictine-Shia inter-religious dialogue in 2017, and another presided over a Christian Muslim Forum that year. On 18 February 2018, the centre participated in the Visit My Mosque open day.Find My Mosque, Visit My Mosque. Building The centre is housed in the former Maida Vale Picture House, a 1,001-seat cinema designed by Edward A. Stone (one of his earliest works) which opened as the Picture Palace on 27 January 1913. The building has two copper-topped towers and a central dome; the auditorium, with oak walls decorated with gilded plaster, originally had a small circle with curtained boxes, and an entrance vestibule with a marble floor and an open fire, with a tearoom above it. Provincial Cinematograph Theatres acquired it in 1920 and renamed it the Picture House in 1923. It was in turn acquired in 1927 by Associated Provincial Picture Houses, who reopened it that September with a new organ, and in 1929 by Gaumont British Theatres, who closed it in November 1940 because of the Second World War. In 1949, after alterations, it was reopened by Mecca Dancing as the Carlton Rooms, a ballroom which was the location of BBC dancing broadcasts. It was converted again into a bingo club in 1961 and became a Grade II listed building in 1991. Jasmine Bingo, the then operator, closed it in 1996.

History The church dates from 1869 to 1905 and was designed by the architect Thomas Hellyer.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner The Foundation stone was laid on Ascension Day 1867. The first phase comprising the Nave, Chancel, Vestry, and Organ Chamber was completed at a cost of ¬£2,789. Bishop Vincent William Ryan, the first Bishop of Mauritius, consecrated it on 7 May 1869. The present Pulpit dates from 1903 and was designed and carved by Miss Editha Plowden. The original pulpit was taken to St John's Church, Bournemouth where it can still be seen today. The South aisle and Porch were added in 1871 and the North aisle and Church Hall in 1876. The Baptistry and the proposed Narthex in 1883 were added in 1905 and was the last of the major building work to take place. The church, rather surprisingly, survived the war years with only a few windows being damaged. The damage to these windows can still be seen in the East window of the Memorial Chapel and the West windows at the back of the church. Damage to one of the Baptistry windows is also visible. The Chancel Arch contains the only example of Victorian painted text work in the church. \\" Draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith\\" (Hebrews 10 22). The true glory of St Saviour's can be seen on the interior, which has been richly and generously furnished over the years. The full scale of Hellyer's church in the Early English style can be appreciated by standing at the entrance to the Galilee Porch and looking towards the High Altar. The tower and bells In 1883 the Vicar, the Revd Charles I Burland, announced that it was proposed to complete St Saviours by the addition of \\"a heaven-pointing Tower with its suitable furniture of pealing bells\\" By early 1887 the tower and spire were completed and the peal of eight bells was installed the following year. The bells were manufactured by Mears and Stainbank of Whitechapel of London. Their total weight is some 75 cwt, with the Tenor alone weighing 18 cwt. Sadly the initial optimism which greeted this project has not been sustained. By 1900 the tower and spire were shrouded in scaffolding to enable repairs to take place. The bells were hung too high, and this, along with the unsteady structure, led to the bells being chimed rather than rung from 1925 to 1985. In 1985 the pinnacles were removed at the junction of the tower, and following a structural report that the tower was indeed safe, much hard work started clearing sixty years of debris. By the 1980s the bells were in a very sorry state. They had hung still in a salt-laden air for a century. No less than 56 bags of pigeon guano were removed from the tower, and it was obvious that if the bells were to have a long-term future, a lot of hard work would have to be done. After 8 years of tireless fundraising, the bells were taken out of the tower to be restored with brand new headstocks, stays, wheels, clappers, pulleys and ball but hung in original frame. Organ The pipe organ dates from 1874 by the builder J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd. The organ is located in the chancel to the north side. It also has two keyboard manuals and 4 composite pedals. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

The festival starts from the first day of Bhadro, the fifth month in Bengali Calendar and continues till the end of the month.Folk Festivals of Bangladesh It has its origins in the story of a princess called Bhadravati (Bhadresvari) of Panchakote who committed suicide. Bhadravati's devotees make an image of her and sing and dance before it throughout the month. On the last day of Bhadra, they gather on the river bank and immerse the image in the water. Songs, mainly focussing on marriage, form the main attraction of the festival in which both professional groups and amateurs take part. Celebrations include fairs and cultural programmes. Location Bhadu festival is mostly celebrated in Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and Bardhaman districts of West Bengal. Folklore Bhadu was an orphan found by the chief (mukhya) of Lada village. Raja Nilmoni Singh Deo of Kashipur in whose kingdom Ladha is located has just introduced a new strain of rice‚ÄîBhaduyi‚Äîfor cultivation in Kashipur is fond of touring the kingdom in a disguise along with his minister, Dhruvachand, to see if his subjects are in favor of the new crop. In the course of his travels he hears that the chief of Lada village has a daughter who is the living embodiment of goddess Lakshmi. He decides to see her in person. He disguised as a Sanskrit pundit (scholar) and was wonderstruck by her beauty and grace and decides to adopt her as his daughter. However, her father, the village chief, will not let her go away and the king decides to let Bhadu stay in the village. He decides to provide her the benefits of a royal princess. Dhruvachand stays behind to oversee her education. Bhadu's new identity, as a royal princess, is kept secret. Bhadu is very popular among the village people because she works actively for their betterment. Then she meets Anjan, son of the doctor (kaviraj) in the neighbouring village. They fall in love, much to the dismay of Dhruvachand. In the meantime the British imprison the king because of his active involvement in the popular uprising of 1857. He is, however, later released. When he hears about Bhadu's involvement with Anjan, he orders the latter's capture and secret imprisonment. Bhadu is heartbroken and, together with two of her companions, travels across the kingdom singing songs at the gates of various forts in which Anjan may be imprisoned, hoping that he will recognize her voice and respond. The king relents and Anjan is released, but by then Bhadu has disappeared. Her companions report that one morning she seemed to fade away, merging with the sky.

The Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund, Whitwell is a parish church in the Church of England located in Whitwell on the Isle of Wight. History The church is medieval. The Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund in Whitwell is located on rising ground at the South end of the village and adjoins the rectory. Various parts of the church date back to different centuries. Various portions of the church were constructed in the 12th, 13th 15th and 16th centuries. However, the church has some more modern parts as well. The church consists of a nave which has a south aisle of three bays, a chancel with south aisle in alignment with the east wall, a western tower and a south porch. Looking at the church, it is evident that the original church did not have aisles, and had a narrow chancel, divided by an arch. A narrow south aisle was added in the 13th century which was later widened in the 16th century. When the church was originally formed, it was of two separate manorial chapels. The bells and clock were installed after the death of William Spindler who passed them on to the church, and is now buried in its graveyard. All the bells have the inscription \\"Cast by John Warner and Sons London 1889\\". In 2009 the bells underwent a refurbishment by Whitechapel Bell Foundry at a cost of more than ¬£30,000. The refurbishment came along with the 120th anniversary of their installation in 1889. The refurbishment was commemorated in the well dressing celebrations that occur annually in the Summer. The churchyard also contains the Commonwealth war grave of a Hampshire Regiment soldier of World War I. On Monday 16 April 2007 Whitwell's Post Office re-opened inside the church's bell tower. Although other post offices have been relocated to new locations on the grounds of local churches, it was the first of its kind in the country to be located inside the church. The idea to locate the new post office inside the church came from the church's vicar, after no other suitable location was found. After the Post Office's relocation into the church proved a success, the island's Rural Community Council (RRC) have stated they would like to see the model applied elsewhere where village amenities are under threat. Although the post office was hoped to also boost attendance numbers at Sunday church services, this has not happened, and the average congregation size remains at only 23.

History  =Early history= As Newcastle upon Tyne did not have a hospital for mentally ill patients of its own, a new asylum was proposed in Coxlodge, where a farmstead known as Dodd's Farm was purchased. In 1864 initial plans were drawn up, and William Lambie Moffatt was appointed architect. The facility opened as Newcastle upon Tyne Borough Lunatic Asylum in July 1869 and became the Newcastle upon Tyne City Lunatic Asylum in 1882. Some of the first patients were transferred from Bensham Asylum as Durham County Magistrates had refused to renew the contract of that facility. In 1884 permission was granted to extend the hospital, and the East and West Pavilions were completed in 1887. These allowed an additional 80 patients to be admitted. The asylum steadily grew, with more buildings were erected. During the First World War the patients were evacuated and the hospital became Northumberland No. 1 War Hospital for wounded soldiers, who were brought there by train. The facility reverted to serving as an asylum again in 1921. In 1948 the National Health Service took over the hospital and changed the name to St Nicholas Hospital. A new admissions unit called the Collingwood Clinic was opened in 1956. = Recent history = Work to build an extension, the Bamburgh Clinic, on the site of a former fish factory, at a cost of ¬£22 million started in November 2004 and was completed in April 2006.

It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on April 16, 2000. It was written by Steven Maeda and Greg Walker and directed by Kim Manners. The episode is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. \\"Brand X\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 6.8, being watched by 10.81 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is horrified when the witness who was due to testify against the Morley cigarette company dies mysteriously. After being called into assist, Mulder and Scully soon discover that a new brand of cigarette has a dangerous secret. Inspired by the 1999 film The Insider, \\"Brand X\\" was written by Maeda and Walker to be an exploration of the corporate evil inside the cigarette industry. The scenes featuring shots of beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects as well as real actors. In one particular scene, over 3,000 live insects were used. Those scenes took up to a full day to film. Plot In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) is charged with guarding the life of Dr. James Scobie, a former researcher who is testifying against his former employer, the Morley tobacco corporation. Prior to his trial, Scobie develops a cough, but shrugs it off. In the morning, Skinner and Scobie's wife find his body on the bathroom floor, with his face ripped away. Morley has created a form of \\"super-tobacco\\", which is inhabited by a genetically engineered tobacco beetle whose eggs can survive the process of cigarette manufacturing and are released in the smoke of the cigarettes. The cigarettes were tested on a range of subjects by Scobie and his colleague, Dr. Peter Voss. Of the four human test subjects, chain smoker Darryl Weaver is the only surviving participant. Prior to his death, Scobie agreed to give Weaver an unlimited supply of cigarettes in exchange for his silence; he subsequently pressures Voss into honoring his \\"arrangement\\" with Scobie. A chain of victims soon succumb to the eggs contained in the toxic smoke, all of whom are found with their bodies covered in the tobacco beetles. While interviewing Weaver, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is exposed to the smoke, later coughing up blood and needing his lungs invasively cleared as the beetles begin to hatch. Voss, who had until now been hiding behind his legal advisor, has a change of heart upon hearing of Mulder's condition and tells Skinner of the aforementioned testing. Skinner goes to Weaver's apartment after getting his name from Voss and finds a Morley employee tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth. When Skinner removes the gag, the man chokes and beetles begin crawling from his mouth. At the hospital, Mulder is in grave danger due to the eggs now hatching in his lungs, and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) attempts to find a way to save him, because he is now \\"too weak for thoracic surgery.\\" Meanwhile, Weaver attempts to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light one of the toxic cigarettes. As Weaver attempts to leave the building, Skinner shoots his shoulder and the pane of glass behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass. He drops his cigarette to the floor and Skinner snuffs it out with his shoe. Back at the hospital, Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder's life. She is correct in her solution, noting that the high level of nicotine in Weaver's system didn't allow the beetles to develop. Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore throat, as well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drives him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. Chided by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves. Production =Writing= right \\"Brand X\\" began as a script that explored \\"the horrifying aspects of over-eating\\". However, since an earlier season seven episode, \\"Hungry\\", had dealt with similar themes, the writing staff decided to take the story in a different direction and examine the \\"corporate evil that populates the cigarette industry\\". The episode's writers, Steven Maeda and Greg Walker, were both admitted fans of The Insider (1999), a film that examines the tobacco industry, and so the two decided to craft an episode with a similar feel.Shapiro, p. 227 Marc Shapiro, in his book All Things: The Official Guide to the X-Files Volume 6, notes that the episode's theme was \\"literally, torn from the headlines\\"‚Äîa rare occurrence for an X-Files episode.Shapiro, p. 226 Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were busy finalizing their own episodes (\\"Hollywood A.D.\\" and \\"All Things\\", respectively), the writers struggled with a way to create a convincing story that did not require Mulder and Scully to be in every scene. The two eventually decided that causing Mulder to get sick in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode. Walker noted, \\"Mulder getting sick in Act Two and being in a hospital bed for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time. It was easier to shoot a bunch of stuff of him in bed than having him have to be in a lot of different locations.\\" =Filming= To match the episode's smoking theme, production designer Corey Kaplan created an overall yellow and brown color scheme for the episode. In this manner, each scene was given \\"a perpetually smoky look\\". Kaplan, who worked closely with episode director Kim Manners, had the idea to \\"enhance\\" Morley Cigarette's corporate offices with \\"long hallways and sets heavy on texture and grit\\" in order to complement the aforementioned palate choice. The scenes of beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects as well as real actors. During one scene in which a victim's body is discovered, over 3,000 live beetles were shot crawling on the body of Mike Hungerford, the portraying actor. Producer Harry Bring later claimed that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because \\"bugs don't take directions very well, so you pretty much have to wait until they decided to get it right.\\" Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode, the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect. The sequences of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley's mouth and the shots of the bugs being sucked out of Mulder were created by combining CGI imagery with \\"dummy bugs\\". Reception \\"Brand X\\" first aired in the United States on April 16, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6.8, with a 10 share, meaning that roughly 6.8 percent of all television-equipped households, and 10 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 10.81 million viewers.Shapiro, p. 281 The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on July 16, 2000, and received 0.75 million viewers, making it the most watched episode that week. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e July 10‚Äì16, 2000\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Tonight the terror is inside. Deep inside.\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a moderately positive review. He wrote that \\"this wasn't the most riveting X-File I've ever seen and there wasn't a tremendous amount of heart-pounding tension from beginning to end [...] but that didn't bother me. Sometimes, just being entertained is enough.\\"Kessenich, p. 129-131 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris concluded that the episode was \\"not the series' most exciting episode, but a solid story with interesting characters used well in the service of the plot\\" Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying \\"'Brand X' benefits from a certain unpredictability in its plot and characters. The menace is unusual, and imaginatively conceived. The tobacco company and its employees display a degree of complexity, rather than merely serving as one- dimensional villains in a public-health morality play.\\" Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating. Wigmore noted that a \\"freshness surrounds the whole episode, presumably a result of the writing\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C\\". She called it a \\"hodge-podge of various elements that have worked in the past but feel beyond tired now\\". She was largely critical of the episode's story, which she felt was a rip-off of The Insider, as well as the make-up effects for the episode, which she called \\"fairly fake\\" looking. VanDerWerff, however, was complimentary towards Tobin Bell's performance, calling him \\"charismatic and interesting\\". Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote \\"Tobacco beetles, dismembered noses and some really bad second-hand smoke permeate this installment, but it gets snuffed out with a lazy payoff.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five.Shearman and Pearson, p. 222 Despite praising the plot, writing \\"it's a great premise, with lots of gore and larvae\\", the two lament its loss in direction: \\"halfway through, once the episode reveals what its concept is, the story is left with nowhere to go.\\" Footnotes Bibliography   External links  \\"Brand X\\" at TV.com 2000 American television episodes Television episodes set in North Carolina The X-Files (season 7) episodes Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

In the later part of her career, during the 1940s and 1950s, she became one of the country's most accomplished children's book illustrators. Biography =Early training= Hays was born on March 13, 1892 in Billings, Montana, where she was raised. After high school, where she was an illustrator for the school newspaper, she attended the Los Angeles School of Art and Design and then the Art Students League of New York.Hays' profile at lambiek.net She won a scholarship to the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, but the start of World War I derailed her studies there. At the time, Hays was on course to become a fine arts painter. She learned, in her words, \\"how to paint pretty pictures‚Äînever dreaming that I was no pretty picture painter.\\"Ethel Hays profile at cartoonician.com During World War I, she took on the task of teaching painting to convalescing soldiers in Army hospitals. After encountering a group of students much more interested in learning cartooning instead, she determined to learn that subject herself. She enrolled in the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course and, \\"keeping a couple of lessons ahead,\\" was able to instruct her class. In this environment, her style of drawing pretty women met with great approval. =Newspaper comics and illustrations= This experience with comic art changed the course of her career. Hays was subsequently offered work as a staff illustrator for the Cleveland Press, a job procured for her by the designer of the correspondence course himself, Charles N. Landon. Soon after, Landon would be touting Ethel Hays as among the \\"former students who are now successful comic strip artists\\" in his magazine ads of the 1920s.Popular Mechanics Magazine, September 1925 Hays' first work at the Cleveland Press was for a trendy feature called Vic and Ethel, which consisted of flapper-themed satire and social commentary‚Äîincluding stories of \\"steeple-climbing and swimming in ice-filled lakes\\" and interviews with visiting celebrities‚Äîaccompanied by Hays's cartoons. Her first comic strip for Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) was derived from that feature and was called simply Ethel. Here Hays continued to chronicle the era when women \\"bobbed their hair and took up active sports.\\" Even at the beginning of her career, Hays' style was \\"already polished and breathtakingly lovely.\\" Flapper Fanny Says (1926): \\"The shoe clerk is often successful because he starts at the foot.\\" Hays also drew the noted one-panel cartoon series Flapper Fanny Says, also for NEA and starting in about 1924, with a Sunday page following in 1928.100 Years of American Newspaper Comics: An Illustrated Encyclopedia, edited by Maurice Horn. New York: Gramercy Books, 1996, pp. 115, 405-06, 413; . In this panel, which featured a flapper illustration and a witticism, Hays \\"moved away from the fancy style of Nell Brinkley, drawing sleeker women with short hair‚Äîsome even wearing pants.\\"Funny Ladies: The New Yorker's Greatest Women Cartoonists and Their Cartoons by Liza Donnelly, Jules Feiffer, Lee Lorenz Contributor Jules Feiffer, Lee Lorenz. Published by Prometheus Books, 2005 , , p. 22. Her panel inspired competition for a time from Faith Burrows' similarly-themed Flapper Filosofy from the rival King Features Syndicate. Ethel Hays was married in 1925 to W.C. Simms of Kansas City, Missouri (she continued to use her maiden name in signing her art throughout her career). By 1928 she was a mother. After she had her second child, she found the daily workload becoming too heavy, and she turned Flapper Fanny Says over to promising newcomer Gladys Parker around 1931. Between 1931 and 1936, however, Hays did find time to illustrate at least 17 stories by noted and prolific author Ellis Parker Butler that were distributed to newspapers.Bibliography of Ellis Parker Butler material, illustrated by Ethel Hays Hays continued to produce a variety of other work for NEA, including full-page illustrations and montages for Every Week magazine, a Sunday newspaper supplement. Her final comic strip for NEA was Marianne, beginning around February 1936, which ran weekly. Comic strip historian Allan Holtz wrote, \\"While the art was vintage Hays, the gags were strictly jokebook material. You could tell her heart was no longer in it.\\" Her final installment ran on December 26, 1937, though the strip continued without her for another year or two.Profile at strippersguide.blogspot.com =Transition to children's book illustration= In 1938‚Äì1940, Hays worked for the Christian Science Monitor, drawing cartoons to accompany a series of poems called \\"Manly Manners.\\" An instructional children's book collecting the feature was published. During this time her work was also featured on a twelve-month calendar (1939). These painted illustrations of children at play presaged in style and content the work of the next stage of her career. Hays had created art for books early in her professional career. Leaving newspaper comic strips behind, she began to work more extensively for children's book publishers, illustrating a variety of nursery rhymes, Christmas stories and alphabet books. Some of her more notable art was Raggedy Ann and Andy material for the Saalfield Publishing Company of Akron Ohio. Saalfield had secured the license from the Johnny Gruelle Company in 1944 to produce Raggedy Ann storybooks, coloring books, paper dollsOpdag.com and booklets. Most of the artwork fell to Hays, \\"whose exuberant, curvilinear style perfectly captured the whimsy and energy of Gruelle's characters\\". Having been trained in painting, she was well-suited for this type of full-color artwork.Raggedy Ann and More: Johnny Gruelle's Dolls and Merchandise (hardcover) by Patricia Hall. Pelican Publishing Company, January 2000. ; ; p. 144 In the 1930s and 1940s, Hays illustrated Puzzle Pages for the publisher McCormick-Mathers of Wichita, Kansas. Puzzle Pages has been described as \\"a reading seatwork series\\" for schoolchildren. The workbook pages included sections for reading and writing, as well as words and pictures for cut-and-paste activities. Students might do coloring in Hays' illustrations.Prairie Bluestem blogsite The copyright on the series was renewed until at least the 1970s.The Catalog of Copyright Renewal Records (1972) by United States Copyright Office, United States Copyright Office Staff. Published by Kessinger Publishing, 2007. =Assessment and legacy= Ethel Hays has been called \\"one of the more successful women cartoonists of the 1920s.\\" Comics historian Trina Robbins wrote that Hays was \\"without a doubt the most brilliant of the women cartoonists influenced by Nell Brinkley.\\" Russell Patterson and John Held, Jr. have also been numbered among her early influences. The artist Roy Crane was influenced by Hays, especially in the drawing of beautiful women. Hays' ubiquitous newspaper illustrations helped promote the idea of the 1920s and 1930s fashion style known as the flapper. She continued to produce newspaper and book illustrations for many years. One source says she retired from commercial art in the 1950s, while at least one other references work into the 1960s. She died in 1989, aged 97.

Facts Phil Collins released Serious Hits‚Ä¶ Live! with 15 tracks in 1990. Rahmlee Davis and Louis Satterfield contributed performances on five tracks and received album royalties via Collins' publishing company Philip Collins Ltd. In 1997, Collins said they had been mistakenly overpaid by a factor of three. They had been paid as if they had performed on all fifteen tracks, but they had only performed on five. To reverse this alleged unjust enrichment, Collins proposed to set off the overpaid royalties on future royalties. Davis and Satterfield argued back they were entitled to royalties without the pro rata reduction, and raised both estoppel and change of position defences. Judgment Jonathan Parker J held Collins had overpaid Davis and Satterfield and he was entitled to set future royalties off against half of the sums overpaid. He said the overpayment was a mistake of fact, because Collins thought they had played in all 15 tracks. Collins was not estopped from maintaining there was overpayment of royalties because there was never any assumption between the parties that Davis and Satterfield would get royalties for all 15 tracks and there was no acquiescence in the assumption. Overpayment was not acquiescence. There was no evidence Davis and Satterfield ever thought they were entitled. The overpayments did not amount to representations that they were (so no estoppel by representation). But the fact of overpayment did result in a general change of position on Davis and Satterfield‚Äôs part. It increased their level of outgoings. However, the defence of change of position was not an ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù doctrine and, in this case, it would be fair to allow the defence to cover one half of the overpayments (Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd [1991] 2 AC 548 applied). Finally, if Collins had made a claim to recover the overpayments his claim would have been statute barred under the Limitation Act 1980, s.5 because it was six years. But here it was not a return of overpayments, only an equitable set off against future royalties. The following is an excerpt about the change of position defence at work.

She attended a Christian elementary school between 1896 and 1900. She graduated from Franciszek-J√≥zef secondary school as an extern pupil in 1907. After graduation she studied mathematics and philosophy under professor Marian Smoluchowski (1872-1917). She was a student of the faculty of philosophy from 1907 to 1912, but after five years she moved to Warsaw and began studying medicine. Frey studied medicine from 1918 to 1923 and received her medical diploma on June 2, 1923. Her studies were interrupted for one year because of the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War. After graduation she continued her work as a senior assistant to professor Kazimierz Orzechowski (1878‚Äì1942) in his Warsaw neurological clinic. At the end of 1928 she left Warsaw to go back to Lw√≥w, and married a lawyer named Mordechai (Marek) Gottesman (1887 in Komarno ‚Äì 1941?). From May 1929 she was working at the neurological clinic in Lw√≥w on Rappaporta Street as a deputy senior consultant. She gave birth to her daughter, Danuta, in 1930. After the Soviet invasion of Poland on September 19, 1939 and the subsequent occupation of Lw√≥w, Mark Gottesman was accused of counter-revolutionary activities and was arrested by the NKVD; nothing is known about him after this point. In 1941, under the German occupation of Lw√≥w, ≈Åucja Frey was resettled to the ghetto and forced to work in Ghettopoliklinik in Zamarstynowska 112. She was probably murdered together with her patients during liquidation of the ghetto in August 1942 or shortly after deportation to Belzec extermination camp.

History The church foundation is medieval but little remains. Rebuilding began in 1635.The Buildings of England, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Nikolaus Pevsner There is a monument to the seventeenth-century admiral Sir Robert Holmes who based his operations at Yarmouth. He obtained it in a raid on a French ship, when he seized an unfinished statue of Louis XIV of France and forced the sculptor to finish it with his own head rather than the king's.BBC DNA page about Robert Holmes However, in the opinion of the author of the guidebook available at the church, this is a legend and \\"It is only fair to say that the face bears more resemblance to King Louis than to the known portraits of Sir Robert.\\" The church consists of nave with north and south aisles, a chancel and a western tower. The original church was said by local tradition to have been at the east end of the town, and its foundations were visible in the old churchyard in 1845. Destroyed by the French in their raid of 1377, it is said to have been rebuilt on the present site only to be again reduced to a ruin in 1543. At the beginning of the 17th century it was practically rebuilt, and reconsecrated by John Davenant the Bishop of Salisbury on 11 March 1626. The chancel, which had a polygonal roof with enriched bosses at the intersection of the ribs, was lengthened by 12 ft. in 1889. To the south of it is the little mortuary chapel containing a fine statue of Sir Robert Holmes, died 1692, and many memorials to the Holmes family. There is a wall tablet by Nollekens to Captain John Urry, 1802, and in the floor are 17th-century grave slabs of the Hide family and to Peter Pryavlx, 1644.

The burial of Jesus refers to the burial of the body of Jesus after crucifixion, described in the New Testament. According to the canonical gospel accounts, he was placed in a tomb by a man named Joseph of Arimathea. In art, it is often called the Entombment of Christ.  Biblical accounts  Stone of anointing at Church of the Holy Sepulchre.300px The earliest reference to the burial of Jesus is in a letter of Paul. Writing to the Corinthians around the year 54 AD,Watson E. Mills, Acts and Pauline Writings, Mercer University Press 1997, page 175. he refers to the account he had received of the death and resurrection of Jesus (\\"and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures\\"). The four canonical gospels, written between 66 and 95AD, all conclude with an extended narrative of Jesus' arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.Powell, Mark A. Introducing the New Testament. Baker Academic, 2009. All four state that, on the evening of the Crucifixion, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body, and, after Pilate granted his request, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a tomb. Modern scholarship emphasizes contrasting the gospel accounts, and finds the Mark portrayal more probable.Maurice Casey, Jesus of Nazareth: An Independent Historian's Account of His Life and Teaching (Continuum, 2010) page 449. = Gospel of Mark = In the earliest of the gospels, the Gospel of Mark, written around 70AD, Joseph of Arimathea is a member of the Jewish Council ‚Äì the Sanhedrin which had condemned Jesus ‚Äì who wishes to ensure that the corpse is buried in accordance with Jewish law, according to which dead bodies could not be left exposed overnight. He puts the body in a new shroud and lays it in a tomb carved into the rock.Douglas R. A. Hare, Mark (Westminster John Knox Press, 1996) page 220. The Jewish historian Josephus, writing later in the century, described how the Jews regarded this law as so important that even the bodies of crucified criminals would be taken down and buried before sunset.James F. McGrath, \\"Burial of Jesus. II. Christianity. B. Modern Europe and America\\" in The Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception. Vol.4, ed. by Dale C. Allison Jr., Volker Leppin, Choon-Leong Seow, Hermann Spieckermann, Barry Dov Walfish, and Eric Ziolkowski, (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2012), p. 923 In this account, Joseph does only the bare minimum needed for observance of the law, wrapping the body in a cloth, with no mention in the Book of Mark about washing or anointing it. This may explain why Mark has a story prior to the Crucifixion, in which a woman pours perfume over Jesus (): Jesus is thereby prepared for burial even before his death.McGrath, 2012, p.937 = Gospel of Matthew = The Gospel of Matthew was written around the year 85 or 90, using the Gospel of Mark as a source. In this account Joseph of Arimathea is not referenced as a member of the Sanhedrin, but a wealthy disciple of Jesus.Daniel J. Harrington, The Gospel of Matthew (Liturgical Press, 1991) page 406.Donald Senior, The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew (Liturgical Press, 1990) page 151. Many interpreters have read this as a subtle orientation by the author towards wealthy supporters, while others believe this is a fulfillment of prophecy from Isaiah 53:9: > \\"And they made his grave with the wicked, And with the rich his tomb; > Although he had done no violence, Neither was any deceit in his mouth.\\" This version suggests a more honourable burial: Joseph wraps the body in a clean shroud and places it in his own tomb, and the word used is soma (body) rather than ptoma (corpse).Donald Senior, The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew (Liturgical Press, 1990) page 151-2. The author adds that the Roman authorities \\"made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.\\" This detail may have been added to answer claims by contemporary opponents that the followers of Jesus had stolen his body. = Gospel of Luke = The Gospel of Mark is also a source for the account given in the Gospel of Luke, written around the year 90. As in the Markan version, Joseph is described as a member of the Sanhedrin,N. T. Wright, Luke For Everyone (Westminster John Knox Press), page 286. but as not having agreed with the Sanhedrin's decision regarding Jesus; he is said to have been \\"waiting for the kingdom of God\\" rather than a disciple of Jesus. = Gospel of John = The last of the gospels, John, differs from Mark on this point, depicting Joseph as a disciple who gives Jesus an honourable burial. John says that Joseph was assisted in the burial process by Nicodemus, who brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes and included these spices in the burial cloth according to Jewish customs. By touching a dead body, both men were knowingly willing to make themselves \\"unclean\\" for seven days per the law stated in . = Comparison = The comparison below is based on the New International Version. { class=\\"wikitable float-left\\" border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" - ! !! style=\\"width:24%\\"  Matthew !! style=\\"width:24%\\"  Mark !! style=\\"width:24%\\"  Luke !! style=\\"width:24%\\"  John - valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"background-color:OldLace;\\"  Joseph and Pilate  Matthew 27:57‚Äì58 * Joseph of Arimathea, a rich man and disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate for Jesus' body in the evening. * Pilate ordered it to be given to him.

John 20:1 * Mary Magdalene went to the tomb on the first day of the week [no indication why]. }  Historicity  The Entombment of Christ by Pedro Rold√°n N. T. Wright notes that the burial of Christ is part of the earliest gospel traditions. John A.T. Robinson states that the burial of Jesus in the tomb is one of the earliest and best-attested facts about Jesus.\\" Rudolf Bultmann described the basic story as 'a historical account which creates no impression of being a legend'. John Dominic Crossan, however, speculates that Jesus' body may have been thrown into a shallow grave and eaten by dogs, the bones scattered. Martin Hengel argued that Jesus was buried in disgrace as an executed criminal who died a shameful death, a view debated in scholarly literature.  Theological significance  Paul the Apostle includes the burial in his statement of the gospel in verses 3 and 4 of 1 Corinthians 15: \\"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures\\" (KJV). This appears to be an early pre-Pauline credal statement.Hans Conzelmann, 1 Corinthians, translated James W. Leitch (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1969), 251. The burial of Christ is specifically mentioned in the Apostles' Creed, where it says that Jesus was \\"crucified, dead, and buried.\\" The Heidelberg Catechism asks \\"Why was he buried?\\" and gives the answer \\"His burial testified that He had really died.\\"Heidelberg Catechism, Q & A 41. A 13th century version of the Entombment of Christ in stained-glass The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that, \\"It is the mystery of Holy Saturday, when Christ, lying in the tomb, reveals God's great sabbath rest after the fulfillment of man's salvation, which brings peace to the whole universe\\" and that \\"Christ's stay in the tomb constitutes the real link between his passible state before Easter and his glorious and risen state today.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church, 624-625 .  Depiction in art  The Entombment of Christ has been a popular subject in art, being developed in Western Europe in the 10th century. It appears in cycles of the Life of Christ, where it follows the Deposition of Christ or the Lamentation of Christ. Since the Renaissance, it has sometimes been combined or conflated with one of these.G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II,1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.164 ff, Wooden sculpture of Christ in His tomb by anonymous Notable individual works with articles include: *The Entombment (Bouts, c. 1450s) *Lamentation of Christ (Rogier van der Weyden, c. 1460-1463) *The Entombment (Michelangelo, c. 1500-01) *The Deposition (Raphael, 1507) *The Entombment (Titian, 1525) *The Entombment (Titian, 1559) *The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio, 1603-04) *Veiled Christ (Sanmartino, 1753)  Use in hymnody  The African-American spiritual Were you there? has the line \\"Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb?\\"Cyberhymnal: Were You There? while the Christmas carol We Three Kings includes the verse: > Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume Breathes a life of gathering gloom; > Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, Sealed in the stone cold tomb. John Wilbur Chapman's hymn \\"One Day\\" interprets the burial of Christ by saying \\"Buried, He carried my sins far away.\\"Cyberhymnal: One Day In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the following troparion is sung on Holy Saturday: > The noble Joseph, when he had taken down Thy most pure body from the tree, > wrapped it in fine linen and anointed it with spices, and placed it in a new > tomb.

He placed second in the UCI Track Cycling World Championships men's sprint in 1896 and 1897. He held the English cycling title among other records. He was accused of dangerous riding among his colleagues. His career was ruined after the death of a fellow rider allegedly due to his negligence. Early life Barden was born in Canterbury, Kent, England. Beginning in 1881, Barden was a resident of the Borough of Chelsea. In 1891 he moved to Kensal Rise. He began racing in his early teens and moved to London where he joined the Polytechnic Cycling Club, making friends with one of the stars, Bert Harris. The two eventually toured Europe together to race in tournaments.http://www.leicester.gov.uk/EasySite/lib/serveDocument.asp?doc=120572&pgid;=7010 Racing In 1892 Barden moved to the club at Catford, then in the countryside south of the city. The Catford club held races in the streets of the village and built a track reputed to be the fastest in Europe. Barden's talent was noticed and developed there. In 1895 Barden rode at Catford against Jimmy Michael of Wales, who won the world's first motor-paced racing championship that year in Cologne, Germany.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme, Nathan, France, vol 2, p444 The occasion ‚Äì which prompted tales of doping and fixing of races ‚Äì was called a Chain Match because it pitted riders using the new Simpson Lever Chains against riders using the standard roller chains. Riders who used Simpson chains were contracted to compete against those using the older design, to prove which was superior.Dodge, Pryor (1996), The Bicycle, Flammarion, France While most accounts say the race was held in Catford, others say it was Germany. Barden and Michael were pitched in a five-mile race in front of a crowd of about 15,000. Right before the race, Michael took a drink provided to him by his coach and manager, Choppy WarburtonChany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme, Nathan, France and began the race. He rode poorly and ended with falling off his bike, remounting and setting off in the wrong direction.The Times, UK, August 2006 Michael's strange behaviour led him to accuse Warburton of doping him. Barden, too, later made accusations of race-fixing and they were to ruin his career in Britain. Barden rode the world professional track championship at Copenhagen in 1896 and Glasgow in 1897, finishing second on both occasions.Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire de Cyclisme, Nathan, France, vol 2, p439 His fame and looks drew huge crowds at velodromes and he was mobbed by fans wherever he went. He was English champion in 1896 and broke records from 440 yards to 10 miles. Accusations and downfall Bert Harris was the first English sprint champion.Leicester Mercury, England, undated cutting In one meeting in Australia he won ¬£800, at a time when a skilled worker in England earned ¬£85 a year. On Easter Monday, 1897, three years after Harris' national championship, with his career starting to fade, he rode at a meeting on the track at Aston, Birmingham. He crashed in the 10-mile race, hitting his head on the track. He died on 21 April without regaining consciousness. Barden accused other riders in the race of causing the fall by cutting away the front wheel through their riding so Harris would not win. The National Cyclists Union held an inquiry and Barden made himself more unpopular by accusing witnesses of \\"out and out lies\\". The issue split fans of cycling, but race promoters were more united and Barden found it harder to get engagements. He could still compete in races on the continent and moved to Paris. He lived there until 1899. Years later, in 1903, Barden participated in the first London Six Day race, where he was initially partnered with Frenchman Raoul Buisson, who was later replaced by Italian Anteo Carapezzi. They finished third, covering 819 miles, 20 miles less than winners Hall and Martin.http://www.sixday.org.uk/html/1903_london.html Personal life He married his first wife Mary in 1897 and by 1911 had 5 children ‚Äì 2 of whom died as children. When he retired and returned to England, he joined the Merchant Navy, sailing on a troop ship to the Boer War. He moved to Leicester, where Bert Harris had lived, and married a girl in the city. He opened a shop in Saffron Lane, Leicester, where a cycle track was later built, then worked at Bentley Engineering in the city. He joined the Working Men's Club, but rarely spoke of his career.

Its precise scope and underlying principles remain a matter of significant academic and judicial controversy.See generally, Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011); Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005). Broadly speaking, the law of restitution concerns actions in which one person claims an entitlement in respect of a gain acquired by another, rather than compensation for a loss.  Framework  Many academic commentators have sought to impose structure upon the law of restitution by searching for a common rationale and constructing taxonomies of the various types of claim.Early examples: Goff & Jones, The Law of Restitution (1st ed, 1966); Peter Birks, An Introduction to the Law of Restitution (1989). Contemporary accounts: Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011). Whether such frameworks can account for the diverse range of restitutionary claims remains a controversial question. The implications of such frameworks for the relationship between law and Equity has often been a significant flashpoint in academic and judicial debate.See generally, Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005). As the law currently stands,See Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29 and Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou [2015] UKSC 66 for affirmation of the distinction between (a) personal actions to reverse unjust enrichment; and (b) proprietary actions in which a claimant seeks a proprietary remedy in respect of a traceable substitute of property once owned by the claimant. The latter is a case founded on the vindication of the claimant's original (and subsisting) property rights. A prominent supporter of this view has been Professor Graham Virgo (see, e.g., Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015). This view has been criticised, most notably by Professor Andrew Burrows (see, e.g., Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011). the law of restitution can be usefully divided into (at least) three broad categories: * Restitution for unjust enrichment * Restitution for wrongs * Restitution to vindicate property rights Outside of these categories exist a range of doctrines which also provide restitutionary or analogous remedies. Academic commentators have sought to rationalise these in terms of unjust enrichment, with various degrees of success. It is now generally accepted that unjust enrichment has a part to play in the doctrine of subrogation.See, e.g., Bank of Cyprus v Menelaou [2015] UKSC 66 Actions for recoupment (historically speaking, an action for money paid to the defendant's use) and contribution have also been said to reverse unjust enrichment.See generally, Charles Mitchell, Law of Contribution and Recoupment (OUP, 2003); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011). Certain statutory frameworks providing for restitutionary remedies have been said to rest on the principle of unjust enrichment.See, e.g., BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt (No 2) [1983] 2 AC 352, in which Robert Goff J held that the statutory framework dealing with frustration contracts was underpinned by a general principle of unjust enrichment. This has not been without controversy: Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015). Restitution for unjust enrichment Where one person has acquired a benefit at the expense of another in circumstances which are unjust and there are no applicable defences, the law imposes an obligation upon the latter person to make restitution. In short, a claimant will have a prima facie action where: * The defendant has been enriched. * This enrichment has been at the claimant's expense. * This enrichment at the claimant's expense is unjust. * There is no applicable defence.https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2013-0171-judgment.pdf The historical core of restitutionary claims to reverse unjust enrichment lies in the law of quasi-contract. These were personal common law actions. In English law, the doctrinal basis of such claims is now said to be unjust enrichment.Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale [1991] With this abstraction has come attempts - with varying degrees of success and controversy - to expand the explanatory power of the principle of unjust enrichment.See generally, Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005) Examples of the types of claim now falling within the modern English law of unjust enrichment include: * Actions to recover mistaken payments * Actions to recover money paid on a total failure of consideration * Actions to recover money paid under duress * Actions for the reasonable value of services provided to the defendant (quantum meruit) * Actions for the reasonable value of goods provided at the request of the defendant (quantum valebat) * Actions to recover money paid to the defendant's use (recoupment claims) Restitution for wrongs Restitution for wrongs refers to a remedy where a gain can be taken away (or 'stripped', 'disgorged', etc.) from a defendant who has committed a wrong, either a tort, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty or breach of confidence. =Torts= Proprietary torts * United Australia Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd * Phillips v Homfray (1883) * Edwards v Lee's Administrators * Penarth Dock Engineering Co Ltd v Pounds * Bracewell v Appleby * Stoke-on-Trent City Council v W&J; Wass Ltd * Ministry of Defence v Ashman * Jaggard v Sawyer Intellectual property torts * Colbeam Plamer Ltd v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd * Patents Act 1977 ss 61-62 * Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 ss 96-97, 191I-J, 229 and 233 Non-proprietary torts * Halifax Building Society v Thomas * Law Commission, Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages (1997) No 247 * Draft Bill clauses 12(1), (5) and 15(6) =Breach of contract= *Wrotham Park Estate Co Ltd v Parkside Homes Ltd *Attorney General v Blake *Experience Hendrix LLC v PPX Enterprises Inc *World Wide Fund for Nature v World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc =Breach of fiduciary duty= *Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver *Boardman v Phipps *Murad v Al-Saraj *Reading v Attorney-General *Attorney-General for Hong Kong v Reid *Daraydan Holdings Ltd v Solland International Ltd =Breach of confidence= *Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers (No 2) *LAC Minerals Ltd v International Corona Resources Ltd Counter restitution In circumstances where one party is claiming recovery of the benefits the other party has unjustly obtained, counter restitution refers to the obligation of the party claiming recovery to repay any benefits they themselves have obtained. Where this party has obtained benefits which cannot be repaid, and therefore counter restitution is impossible, then their claim for recovery of benefits will be barred.Arnold v National Westminster Bank [1989] 1 Ch 63 at 67Farnhill, R., Restitution Claims: Getting your own back, Allen & Overy Litigation Review, published 15 March 2011, accessed 4 September 2020 See also *English unjust enrichment  References  * P Birks, Unjust Enrichment (2nd Ed, Clarendon, Oxford, 2005) * A Burrows, J Edelman and E McKendrick, Cases and Materials on the Law of Restitution (2nd Ed, OUP, Oxford, 2007) * Charles Mitchell and Paul Mitchell, Landmark Cases in the Law of Restitution (Hart, 2006), essays on legal history.

Earlier in the year, Ruwaad signed a memorandum of understanding with KZN Premier S‚Äôbu Ndebele. The planned R44m development by Ruwaad will occupy 16,500ha.

'Memories of forced settlements‚Äô, The National, 20 December 2008 To achieve this, the proposed development necessitates that the eMacambini community is going to be displaced from their rural land and rehoused on less land in a suburban township. If the plan goes ahead, 29 schools, 300 churches, three clinics and brand-new RDP houses will be demolished. Especially relevant to the community would be the demolishing of ancestral graves. In all, between 20,000 and 50,000 people in the region will be forcibly removed. Protest On 4 December 2008, the eMacambini community blockaded the N2 and R102 freeways to protest S'bu Ndebele's non-reply to their memorandum handed over in a previous march. Police responded with rubber bullets injuring about 50 people and arresting 10. There were reports that many shot were innocent bystanders pulled out of their homes. There are also reports that many of the 10 people arrested were refused medical treatment. Police have justified their actions by claiming that residents threw stones at oncoming cars.

Early life Hoyt was born on March 2, 1849 in Cleveland, Ohio. He was one of six children born to Mary Ella (n√©e Beebe) Hoyt (1814‚Äì1890) and Dr. James Madison Hoyt (1815‚Äì1895), a Baptist minister, lawyer, businessman and author. Among his siblings was Wayland Hoyt, who was also a Baptist minister and author. He was a descendant of Simon Hoyt, who landed in Massachusetts in 1628 and settled in Windsor, Connecticut, and Walker Hoyt, who was one of the first settlers of Norwalk. Hoyt attended public schools in Cleveland before attending the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He abandoned school due to his father's ill health, going into this father's law offices, before entering real estate. Career In 1881 he came to New York and became affiliated with James B. Colgate & Co. (James Boorman Colgate was his uncle by marriage) For many years thereafter, he was a prominent financier in New York on Wall Street who specialized in railroad transportation. He later became a partner of Colgate, Hoyt & Co. in which he was active in the organization and finance of many businesses. He was a director of the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, and one of the founders of Everett, Washington, where a main street is named after him. Hoyt and Charles Colby advised John D. Rockefeller, who they knew from the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church. Much of the capital used to build Everett, Washington came from Rockefeller's investments, apparently without his knowledge. Rockefeller naively trusted Hoyt and Colby largely due to their Baptist affiliation. According to Pulitzer prize-winning historian Ron Chernow, drawing on Frederick T. Gates memoir and other sources, the duo fleeced Rockefeller, which Rockefeller initially refused to believe. They left him with significant losses in speculative land, timber, and other industrial investments after exiting the investments themselves. The situation was uncovered by Gates who was asked to assess investment sites on his due diligence travels for Rockefeller's philanthropic efforts. Gates personally visited supposed investment sites in Alabama, Wisconsin, and Colorado. One of the visits was to an iron ore which Rockefeller believed was generating $1,000 per day in profit. In reality, he was losing that amount daily while Hoyt and Colby were ostensibly using their connections to inflate speculative activity in local real estate. Rockefeller, Gates, and possibly George Rogers (of Standard Oil) found that Hoyt and Colby had been sending statements with falsified or misleading financial values.

She was the daughter of tsar Mitso Asen of Bulgaria and his wife Maria. The dates and the places of her birth and death are unknown.  History  Through her mother, Kira Maria was a granddaughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria and Irene Komnene of Epirus. She was also the sister of tsar Ivan Asen III, who seized the Bulgarian throne in 1280 with Byzantine support. She married the Bulgaro-Cuman nobleman George Terter in a marriage arranged by her brother in order to strengthen his position. George divorced his first wife, Maria, and sent her and their son, Theodore Svetoslav, as hostages to the Byzantine Empire. He was accordingly made a despotƒìs, the highest rank in the Byzantino-Bulgarian court hierarchy, and Kira Maria was granted the title of despoina. Ivan Asen III failed to assert himself throughout the country and he secretly fled Tarnovo in 1280 and escaped to the Byzantine Empire. George Terter seized the throne and Kira Maria was proclaimed the new tsarina. However, she was very unpopular in Tarnovo, because of her deposed brother. Her marriage also proved to be controversial as Maria Terter was still alive in Constantinople. According to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church George's first marriage was still valid and Kira Maria was his uncanonical wife. Patriarch Yoakim III of Bulgaria threatened to excommunicate the couple and insisted that he would not relent until George I Terter put away Kira Maria. The tsar re-opened negotiations with the Byzantine Empire and sought the return of Maria, what he eventually accomplished in a treaty in which Maria and Kira Maria exchanged places as empress and hostage.

The goal of the operation was the destruction of a salient around the central Bosnian town of Jajce, which was held by the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeƒáe obrane ‚Äì HVO) and the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine ‚Äì ARBiH). The intensity of fighting varied considerably and involved several major VRS offensive efforts interspersed by relative lulls in fighting. Jajce fell to the VRS on 29 October 1992, and the town's capture was followed by the destruction of all its mosques and Roman Catholic churches. The fighting improved the safety of VRS lines of communication south of the Bosnian Serb capital of Banja Luka, and displaced between 30,000 and 40,000 people, in what foreign observers called \\"the largest and most wretched single exodus\\" of the Bosnian War. The ARBiH and HVO in Jajce were not only outnumbered and outgunned, but their units were also plagued by inadequate staff work, compounded by lack of coordination between separate command and control structures maintained by the two forces throughout the battle. The defence of Jajce also suffered from worsening Croat‚ÄìBosniak relations and skirmishes between the ARBiH and the HVO along the resupply route to Jajce. Ultimately, the outcome of the battle itself fueled greater Bosniak‚ÄìCroat animosities, which eventually led to the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War. The VRS saw the cracking of the ARBiH‚ÄìHVO alliance as a very significant outcome of the operation. Background As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija ‚Äì JNA) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske ‚Äì VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February ‚Äì 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. At the same time, the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces clashed with the HVO at the Kupres Plateau, capturing Kupres by 7 April. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine ‚Äì ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeƒáe obrane ‚Äì HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska ‚Äì HV), which occasionally supported HVO operations. In late April, the VRS was able to deploy 200,000 troops, hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage ‚Äì HOS) could field approximately 25,000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons, while the ARBiH was largely unprepared with nearly 100,000 troops, small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons. Arming of the various forces was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991. By mid-May 1992, when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Even though the Graz agreement, negotiated by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed cessation of hostilities between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), in the north of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Timeline Map of Operation Vrbas '92 While the fighting related to Operation Corridor 92 was still in progress, the VRS prepared to attack and destroy a salient around the town of Jajce in central part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, held jointly by the HVO and the ARBiH. The salient threatened Bosnian Serb lines of communication south of VRS-held Banja Luka and contained two hydroelectric power plants critical for electrical supply of Banja Luka region. The salient was held by between 3,400 and 5,500 HVO and ARBiH troops manning strong fortifications in difficult terrain. The VRS committed 7,000‚Äì8,000 troops of the 30th Infantry Division of the 1st Krajina Corps to the offensive codenamed Operation Vrbas '92. The 30th Division was under command of Colonel Stanislav Galiƒá, until he was replaced by Colonel Dragan Marƒçetiƒá in early September. The VRS troops included the 1st, 11th and 17th Light Infantry Brigades and 1st Mixed Antitank Artillery Battalion. Besides the numerical superiority, the VRS held a clear advantage in armour, deploying 20‚Äì30 tanks and adding 30‚Äì50 heavy artillery pieces to the force. Defence of Jajce was organised at municipal crisis headquarters level by mayor Midhat Karad≈æiƒá, while the HVO force in Jajce was commanded by Stjepan Bla≈æeviƒá. =Initial combat= The Jajce salient was supported via a road running through a narrow corridor to the town of Travnik. In July, the VRS attempted to cut the supply corridor and isolate Jajce from Travnik before any effort was made to capture the salient, but the attacks failed to accomplish any significant headway. This prompted the VRS to switch to a gradual advance along three separate axes converging on Jajce directly instead. The move was designed to minimize VRS casualties and allow a systematic elimination of HVO and ARBiH defences around the town. ARBiH-HVO successfully defended Jajce from the VRS, in part thanks to the area's mountainous surroundings. In the same month, feuding between the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) over political control began and the HVO forcibly disbanded the Bosniak-led war presidency in Jajce in exchange for one that was pro-Croat. The VRS launched the first major attack along the western approach to Jajce in mid-August. The attack pushed through the town's defences and the VRS arrived to within of Jajce. After this breakthrough, the frontline stabilised for nearly a month before the VRS made another push towards Jajce. The advance came from the southwest of the town and the defenders were pushed back to within from the town. In order to relieve Jajce, the ARBiH and the HVO launched a joint attack north of Bugojno and Novi Travnik against a flank of the VRS force attacking Jajce, but the offensive failed‚Äîgaining no ground at all and hardly making any impact on the VRS deployments around Jajce. The VRS continued shelling Jajce and started small-scale airstrikes in the area. That led the United Nations (UN) to declare the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina a no-fly zone. A Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysis concluded that it is possible that the failure of the ARBiH‚ÄìHVO counterattack prompted the HVO to agree on a short-lived truce with the VRS in early October. Besides a ceasefire, the agreement promised the Bosnian Serbs power supply from the hydroelectric power plants in Jajce salient if the Serbs stopped their offensive. =The final attack= Relations between the ARBiH and the HVO deteriorated in the area of nearby town of Prozor, and Novi Travnik in late summer. The strained relations escalated rapidly and led to an armed clash between the two forces in Novi Travnik on 18 October. Low-scale conflicts spread in the region, and the two forces engaged each other along the supply route to Jajce three days later, on 21 October, as a result of an ARBiH roadblock set up the previous day on authority of the \\"Coordinating Committee for the Protection of Muslims\\" rather than the ARBiH command. Just as the roadblock was dismantled, a new skirmish occurred in the town of Vitez the following day. The developments also meant that supply of ammunition for Jajce defenders was unable to move further than Prozor, and prompted the commander of the HVO Central Bosnia Operational Zone Colonel Tihomir Bla≈°kiƒá to consider pulling a part of the HVO troops from Jajce to reopen the Jajce‚ÄìProzor route. Bla≈°kiƒá's position was weakened by the HVO headquarters since 18 October, when a quarter of heavy weapons at his disposal were removed to ƒåapljina, ahead of HV's Operation Vla≈°tica aimed at Dubrovnik hinterland. The overall poor situation culminated in the Battle of Prozor fought between the HVO and the ARBiH. The battle began on 23 October, just after the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) managed to calm the situation in Vitez and Novi Travnik. End of fighting in and around Prozor was arranged on 26 October, coming into effect two days later. The VRS seized the opportunity to launch a fresh advance towards Jajce amid ARBiH‚ÄìHVO clashes, attacking along three axes towards the town on 25 October. Putting their conflict aside, the HVO and the ARBiH deployed in Jajce fought back for four days before the VRS entered the town on 29 October. As the VRS capture of the town appeared inevitable, the defending force pulled out. Following its capture, Serb radio and television declared Jajce a \\"liberated town\\" and a part of \\"the free Serbian republic\\". Aftermath =Exodus and destruction of religious sites= The ruins of St. Luke's Catholic Church on the outskirts of the town. After the VRS entered Jajce, the HVO and the ARBiH pulled out from the remainder of the salient towards Travnik. They were joined by the civilian population of Jajce, forming a column of between 30,000 and 40,000 refugees that stretched , and among which thousands were vulnerable to VRS sniping and shelling. Foreign observers described this as \\"the largest and most wretched single exodus\\" of the Bosnian War. Upon their arrival in Travnik, the refugees were attended to by UNHCR staff assisted by UNPROFOR troops. At least seven died at the Travnik hospital, while about 60 were treated for injuries. Approximately 20,000 Bosniak refugees from Jajce were resettled in central Bosnia, providing manpower for several new ARBiH brigades. Croat refugees headed toward Croatia due to rising tensions between Bosniaks and Croats in central Bosnia and overcrowding in Travnik. By November the pre-war population of Jajce had shrunk from 45,000 to just several thousand. Bosniaks had previously accounted for 39 percent of the population, Croats 35 percent, and Serbs 19 percent. In the weeks following its capture, all of the mosques and Roman Catholic churches in Jajce were demolished as retribution for the HVO's destruction of the town's only Serbian Orthodox monastery in mid-October. The VRS converted the town's Franciscan monastery into a prison and its archives, museum collections and artworks were looted; the monastery church was completely destroyed. By 1992, all religious buildings in Jajce had been destroyed, save for two mosques whose perilous positioning on a hilltop made them unsuitable for demolition. =Legacy= Jajce town centre While the conflict between the HVO and the ARBiH contributed to the weakening defence of Jajce, the military superiority of the VRS was the principal reason behind the town's capture. Besides the advantage in troop size and firepower, VRS staff work and planning was significantly superior to the organisational efforts of the defenders of Jajce. The principal problem for the defence of Jajce was that the town was defended by two separate command structures, one having authority over ARBiH troops and the other over HVO units. Humanitarian workers and foreign military observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, as well as territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS in exchange for the Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman and Yugoslav President Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also been a part of the Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia. It is unclear who pulled out of Jajce first and it remains a point of \\"mutual recrimination\\". Bosniaks complained that the HVO was to blame for the loss of Jajce since its units were the first to pull out when the VRS entered the town. Conversely, the Bosnian Croat leader, Bo≈æo Raiƒá, publicly complained about the conduct of the ARBiH in central Bosnia, blaming extremists among the ARBiH personnel for hindering the resupply of Jajce. His stance was reflected in the Croatian daily Veƒçernji list. The newspaper assumed a confrontational position regarding Bosniaks while maintaining that the Bosniak leadership was not entirely anti-Croat. Croat‚ÄìBosniak relations gradually deteriorated, leading to the Croat‚ÄìBosniak War in 1993. In October 1993, VRS Major General Momir Taliƒá, commander of the 1st Krajina Corps during Operation Vrbas '92, said that the capture of Jajce was the first step in dismantling of the alliance between the Bosnian Croats and Bosniaks. The Croat‚ÄìBosniak rift would not be mended before the Washington Agreement signed in March 1994, but not completely. After the HVO recaptured Jajce in the HV-led Operation Mistral 2 on 13 September 1995, the town was Croatised, and Bosniak refugees were not allowed to return. By 1998, most Croat refugees had returned to Jajce, while only 5,000 Bosniaks did so. The ARBiH and HVO lost 103 soldiers defending Jajce; a further 492 were wounded and five remain missing. In 2008, the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina indicted two members of the VRS for war crimes committed against Bosniaks in September 1992, citing the killing of 23 Bosniak civilians and wounding of a number of others. In 2010, the Prosecutor's Office began an investigation against seven members of the ARBiH, HVO, and HOS on suspicion that they committed war crimes between 27 May and 29 October 1992 against 35 Serb civilians, including the murder of at least 15.

A combination of factors including economic hardship and failure to resist Western imperialism led many in China to be unhappy with the Qing government. When a new program to colonize Mongolia with Han Chinese and assimilate the natives was unveiled, it was met with resistance that resulted in a relatively bloodless separation from the Qing Empire. Many Barga and Inner Mongolian chieftains assisted in the revolution and became the revolution leaders. The setting of Outer Mongolia Outer Mongolia in 1911. By the early 20th century, Mongolia was impoverished. Repercussions from the Taiping Rebellion (1850‚Äì1864) were primarily responsible for this economic deterioration. Loss of tax revenue from South China during the rebellion and expenses for its suppression had depleted the Qing treasury. Silver, rather than livestock as was the custom, became the primary medium for paying taxes.Sh. Natsagdorj, Manjiin erkhsheeld baisan √ºyeiin Khalkhyn khurangui t√º√ºkh (1691‚Äì1911) [The history of Khalka under the Manchus], (Ulan Bator, 1963, p. 173. The major source of silver for Mongolians was from loans borrowed from Chinese merchants. These loans, transacted at crippling interest rates, were repaid in livestock, which was then exported to China. The result was a catastrophic decline in the size of the herds upon which the livelihood of Mongolians depended.A.P. Bennigsen, while traveling through Mongolia in 1909 to 1911, was told by Mongolians that their herds had decreased ten-fold during the past decade. Neskol'ko dannykh o sovremmenoi Mongolii [Some information on modern Mongolia], (St. Petersburg, 1912), p. 57. This is supported by the archives of the ecclesiastical administration of the Jebzundamba Hutuhtu (Ikh Shav'), which recorded a decline in the number of livestock from a million in 1861 to around 12,000 in 1909. D. Tsedev, Ikh shav' [Ecclesiastical administration], (Ulan Bator, 1964), p. 91. A disintegrating economy, growing debt, and increasing tax demands were ingredients of social and political unrest in Mongolia. However, it was Qing plans for the transformation of Outer Mongolia that produced the impetus for rebellion. The \\"New Administration\\" The Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911) was founded by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in what is today Northeast China (also known as Manchuria). They were certainly not the first non-Han people to rule all of China, but the fate of these previous dynasties had always been the same: they invaded; they governed; they intermarried; and eventually they merged, more or less becoming Chinese themselves. Attempts were made to keep the Manchu strain ethnically pure, although these efforts proved fruitless. The early Manchu rulers enacted various laws to isolate Manchuria from China proper (Eighteen Provinces) and Mongolia. They did the same for the Mongols: Han Chinese were prohibited from entering Mongolia and Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden from speaking Chinese languages or intermarrying with the Han Chinese. While over time enforcement waned, the laws still remained on the books, receiving at least token observance. Western imperialism in China during the latter part of the 19th century changed political priorities in China. The Qing defeat by the Japanese in 1895 (First Sino-Japanese War), followed shortly afterwards by the German seizure of Shantung and the \\"scramble for concessions\\" that followed dramatically proved the inadequacy of previous Qing efforts to resist the West. The Boxer Rebellion, and particularly Japan's victory over Russia in 1905, were widely interpreted in China as the triumph of constitutionalism over autocracy. It was then that far-reaching economic, political, and military reforms, known as the \\"New Administration\\" or \\"New Policies\\" (Xin zheng), were ordered. In Outer Mongolia, however, the New Administration was accented rather differently. The aim was not simply modernization, as it was in Han Chinese territories, but cultural assimilation. Russia's occupation of the Liaodong Peninsula in 1898 and then of Northern Manchuria in 1900 confirmed the Qing government's fears of a larger Russian design on the entire northern frontier of their empire. The Qing rulers believed that survival of their state as an integral entity depended on the effectiveness of their frontier serving as a protective \\"shield\\" (in the language of the time) for China proper. To accomplish this, the peoples inhabiting this region would have to become Chinese. Between 1901 and 1910, therefore, the Qing government inaugurated an expansive plan for Chinese colonization of the frontier and reorganization of its native governments (though the colonization of lands in Inner Mongolia by the Chinese has started much earlier). A decree in 1910 abrogating the old prohibitions against Chinese settling in Outer Mongolia, Chinese and Mongols intermarrying, and Mongols using the Chinese language was the final step toward dismantling that wall of isolation that the Manchus had erected centuries earlier.Thomas E. Ewing, Revolution on the Chinese Frontier: Outer Mongolia in 1911, Journal of Asian History, v. 12, p. 104 (1978). See also Thomas E. Ewing, Ch'ing Policies in Outer Mongolia 1900‚Äì1911, Modern Asian Studies, v. 14 (1980). Jebstundamba Khutuktu In early 1910 the Qing government appointed Sando (or Sandowa), a Manchu himself and former deputy lieutenant governor of Guihwa, as viceroy of Mongolia in the capital city of Urga (modern Ulaanbaatar), to implement the New Administration. He immediately set about organizing twenty offices to oversee such matters as the military, taxation, police, government and commerce. Plans were made for the colonization of Mongolia with Chinese farmers. In January 1911 a Lieutenant Colonel Tang Zaili arrived to supervise the organization of a Mongolian army, half of which was to consist of Mongolian herdsmen. A 400-room barracks was erected near Urga. The Mongolians saw in all this a threat to their very survival. Their desperation was echoed in a petition to the Qing government: \\"Among the many directives repeatedly issued, there is not one which benefits the Mongolians. Consequently, we all desire that we be allowed to live according to our ancient ways.\\" Chen Chungzu, Wai menggu jinshi shi [The modern history of Outer Mongolia], (Shanghai, 1926), bien 2, p. 5. The arrogance and brutality of Tang Zaili's staff and military escort did not help.Natsagdorj, p. 261. Mongolian resistance No more than a month after Sando's arrival, a brawl broke out between some intoxicated lamas (Buddhist priests) and Chinese at a Chinese carpentry shop in Urga. Such incidents were not unknown in the past, but they had been firmly suppressed by Qing officials. This one developed differently. When Sando arrived at Gandan Monastery, the principal monastery in the city, to make arrests, the lamas pelted him and his troops with stones, forcing them to withdraw. Sando demanded that the Jebstundamba Khutuktu (variously spelled), the spiritual leader in Urga of the Mongolians, surrender a particular lama believed to be the ringleader of the incident. The Khutuktu refused and Sando fined him. In response, the Mongolians petitioned the Qing government to remove Sando, but without success.Ewing, p. 106. Other incidents followed, all underscoring the diminished authority of Sando: A minor noble, Togtokh Taij, with a small band, had with the connivance of local Mongolian officials plundered several Chinese merchant shops in eastern Mongolia. Sando dispatched two detachments of soldiers to capture Togtokh. They were led into a trap by their Mongolian guide; most were killed. Mongolian princes resisted providing soldiers for Sando's army. And the prince of the khoshuun which Togtokh had raided refused Sando's demand to pay compensation to the plundered Chinese merchants.Chen Lu, Jrshi biji [Reminiscences], Shanghai (1919), p. 179. The decision for independence Prince Namnans√ºren By the spring of 1911, some prominent Mongolian nobles including Prince T√∂gs-Ochiryn Namnans√ºren persuaded the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to convene a meeting of nobles and ecclesiastical officials to discuss independence. The Khutukhtu consented. To avoid suspicion, he used as a pretext the occasion of a religious festival, at which time the assembled leaders would discuss the need to reapportion taxes among the khoshuuns. The meeting occurred on July 10 and the Mongolians discussed whether it would be better to submit to or resist the will of the Qings. The assembly became deadlocked, some arguing for complete, others for partial, resistance. Eighteen nobles decided to take matters into their hands. Meeting secretly in the hills outside of Urga, they decided that Mongolia must declare its independence. They then persuaded the Khutuktu to send a delegation of three prominent representatives‚Äîa secular noble, an ecclesiastic, and a lay official from Inner Mongolia‚Äîto Russia for assistance.L. Dendev, Monglyn tovch t√º√ºkh [Short history of Mongolia],(Ulan Bator, 1934), p. 2; Sh. Sandag, Mongolyn uls t√∂riin gadaad khariltsaa (1850‚Äì1919) Foreign relations of Mongila (1850‚Äì1919) (Ulan Bator, 1971), p. 244. The particular composition of the delegation‚Äîa noble, a cleric, and a commoner‚Äîmay have been intended to invest the mission with a sense of national consensus. Letter to foreign ministries declaring Mongolia's independence The delegation to St. Petersburg brought with it a letter signed in the name of the Khutuktu and the \\"four khans of Khalkha.\\" It asked for assistance against the Chinese, including arms, and implied that Russian troops would be needed against a Chinese unit which the Mongolians believed was at that moment advancing into Mongolia. To coax a commitment, the Mongols promised economic concessions in return. The letter itself was unclear as to the specific type of relationship the Mongols wished to establish with Russia. Russia wanted to include Outer Mongolia in its sphere of influence and as a buffer state offering protection from China and Japan, but never planned to make it a part of her empire.Batsaikhan, O. Mongolyn tusgaar togtnol ba Khyatad, Oros Mongol gurvan ulsyn 1915 ony Khiagtyn geree (1911‚Äì1916). Ulaanbaatar: Mongol Ulsyn Shinjlekh Ukhaany Acad. Publ. The Russian government decided to support, by diplomatic rather than by military means, not full independence for Mongolia, but autonomy within the Qing empire. It did, however, increase its consular guard in Urga to protect the returning delegation.Die Internationalen Beziehungen im Zeitalter des Imperialismus [International Relations in the Age of Imperialism], (Berlin, 1931‚Äì40), s. III, v. 1.1, p. 405. The Russian minister in Beijing was then instructed to inform the Qing government that the Mongols had sent a delegation to St. Petersburg complaining of Chinese immigration, military build-up, and administrative reorganization. He stated that Russia could not but be concerned about these developments, in view of the common boundary shared with Khalkha, and cautioned that China would have to bear the consequences if this warning were ignored.Die Internationalen Beziehungen, pp. 494‚Äì95. Independence The Russian Consulate in Kh√ºree On learning of the Mongolian mission to Russia, the Qing government instructed Sando to investigate. Sando immediately summoned the head of the Khutukhtu's ecclesiastical administration (Ikh shav'), the Erdene Shanzav, and demanded an explanation. The Erdene Shanzav, pleading that he had not been involved, revealed the entire plot. Sando then demanded that the Khutuktu withdraw his request for Russian troops. The Khutuktu agreed, provided that Sando dismantle the New Administration. Sando cabled to Beijing for instructions, and was told that parts of the New Administration could be delayed.Chen Lu, p. 185. Sando ordered the princes in Urga to sign a statement that only a few individuals had been responsible for the appeal to Russia. The princes did give such a declaration, but only orally. Sando then ordered the Mongolians to have no further contact with the Russian consulate, threatening in case of disobedience to bring an additional 500 troops to Urga and to arm the Chinese population in the city. He posted sentries around the Khutuktu's palace with orders to bar Russian visitors. And he sent a contingent of troops to the Russian-Mongolian border to intercept the Mongolian delegation to Russia on its return.Internationalen Beziehungen, p. 495. Events of seismic proportions were then taking place in China proper. On October 10 there was an uprising in Wuchang and a revolution against the minority ruling class had begun. One province after another declared its independence from the Qing authority. Believing that his position was untenable, Sando wired the Beijing government asking for permission to resign, but his request was denied. In the meantime, the Mongolian delegation to Russia secretly returned, and reported the results of its trip to a group of princes and lamas. They composed a joint memorial to the Khutukhtu asking what Mongolia should do in lieu of the provincial uprisings. He advised that Mongolians form a state of their own.Dendev, pp. 19‚Äì21. Buoyed by the Khutuktu's support and by the impending collapse of the Qing dynasty, the Provisional Government of Khalkha was formed, headed by some prominent Khalkha nobles. On November 28, the government ordered all four provinces (aimag) of Khalkha to mobilize a thousand soldiers each. Almost immediately 500 men from the neighboring khoshuuns had gathered in Urga. Two days later, Sando received a letter, signed in the name of the nobles and lamas of Khalkha, stating that they had heard of a secessionist movement in China, and that Chinese troops of the \\"revolutionary party\\" were preparing to march on Urga from Inner Mongolia. The letter went on to state that, in view of the benefit obtained by the Khalkhas from the Qing in the past, the Khutuktu had ordered the mobilization of 4000 troops to advance on Beijing to defend the Emperor. Sando was asked to provide these men with provisions and arms. He was given three hours to reply. No reply came. Abandoning this thin deception, a delegation of nobles and lamas visited the amban's office, and informed him of their decision to declare independence and to install the Khutuktu as emperor. Sando pleaded with the delegation. He admitted that what had come to pass was the result of his own folly, and he promised to recommend full autonomy for Mongolia, but not independence. The delegation curtly replied that it had come simply to deliver a message, not to debate it. Sando was ordered to leave the country within 24 hours.Chen Lu, pp. 185‚Äì86. There was little Sando could do. He had only 150 troops, who in any event were in a refractory mood because of arrears in back pay. On the following day, his soldiers were disarmed by Mongolian militiamen, as well as Russian Cossacks of the consular convoy under command of Grigory Semyonov, future Ataman. Sando and his staff moved into the compound of the Russian consulate for their own safety. Togtokh and Ja Lama in Khuree On 30 November 1911 the Mongols established Temporary Government of Khalkha. On December 5, Sando left Mongolia with Russian escort.Sando went to Mukden in Manchuria, where he received a telegram expressing the emperor's astonishment over Sando's inability to control the Mongols. The Amban was removed from office, and he was ordered to await an inquiry into his conduct. Chen Chungzu, Waimenggu jinshi shi [The recent history of Mongolia], Shanghai, 1926; repr. Taipei, 1965), bien 1, p. 13. The fall of the Qing saved him from further embarrassment, or worse. Chinese authority in the rest of the country collapsed quickly after that. Later that month or in January 1912 (sources differ) the Military Governor of Uliastai in western Mongolia, his staff and military guards, peacefully departed under the protection of Cossack troops. The Deputy Military Governor of Khovd, however, decided to resist, hoping for reinforcements from Xinjiang. The troops came too late: the town was surrounded by Mongolian troops, reinforcement detachment was crushed. In August 1912, his stronghold was overcome by Mongolian troops, and he and his staff were escorted out of the country by Cossacks.A.V. Burdukov, V staroi i novoi Mongolii. Vospominaniya, pis'ma [In old and new Mongolia. Reminiscences, letters] (Moscow, 1969). On December 1, the Provisional Government of Khalkha issued a general proclamation announcing the end of Qing rule and the establishment of a theocracy under the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. At the end of the month, on December 29, the Khutuktu was formally installed as the Bodg Khaan (\\"Great Khan\\", or \\"Emperor\\") of the new Mongolian state. This ushered in Bogd Khan era. While all Barga, Dariganga, Khovd, Huvsgul region, 26 hoshuns of Ili region (Dzungarian Oirads), 24 hoshuns from Upper Mongolian 29 hosnuns, 35 hoshuns from the Inner Mongolian 49 hoshuns sent statements to support Bogd Khan's call of Mongolian reunification, in reality however, most of them were too prudent or irresolute to attempt joining the Bogd Khan regime.Proceedings of the Fifth East Asian Altaistic Conference, December 26, 1979 ‚Äì January 2, 1980, Taipei, China, p144 The Mongolian revolution was for the most part an orderly transference of power.Some shops in Urga were looted and burned, but for the most part the Chinese were left unmolested. The departure of the Uliastai Military Governor was also peaceful. The storming of Khovd and the loss of life and property several months later were the exception. Its relatively peaceful character was due to the realism of Qing authorities in Mongolia, and in no small part to the presence of Russian troops, who provided protection for these authorities and Chinese troops. The situation was different in Inner Mongolia. There, Chinese authorities remained in power, even though Mongol activists were preparing to join Outer Mongolia in independence. Members of the pro-Qing Royalist Party were known to support the independence of Inner Mongolia, and some argued for a monarchist state covering Manchuria as well as Outer and Inner Mongolia. Most notably, Gungsangnorbu, leader of the Inner Mongolian Harqin Banner, forged close contacts with the Japanese in December 1911. He and other inner Mongolian princes took loans, promised the Japanese mining rights and received major arms shipments. Role of Russia autonomy of Mongolia and obtains trade concessions. The role of the Russians in this revolution (and later in the revolution of 1921) has been controversial. Chinese historians especially have often explained the events of 1911 as the product of \\"Tsarist provocations and manipulations\\". This conclusion however contradicts with archival materials from Russia and Mongolia. The movement for independence in Outer Mongolia was to a large extent the reaction to the new Qing policies aimed at assimilating the Mongols by Han Chinese. Russian imperial government preferred to see Outer Mongolia as a buffer state against Chinese and Japanese influences on the Russian borders in Siberia, a dependent state or autonomy of China.

It is roughly bounded by Lyndon, Outer Drive, Grand River Avenue, Southfield Freeway, Glastonbury Avenue, Lyndon Street and Westwood Drive. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. The Rosedale Park district has the largest number of individual properties of any district nominated to the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan, with 1533.Rosedale Park Historic District from the state of Michigan The district contains primarily brick houses, and was largely developed from the late 1920s through the 1940s. History The land on which Rosedale Park sits was originally deeded in 1835 to Otis C. Freeman and George Bellamy as two 80-acre (32 ha) parcels.Commonwealth Cultural Resources Group, Inc., National Register Registration Form for Proposed Rosedale Park Historic District Over time, these parcels were subdivided until in 1916 the Rosedale Park Land Development Company purchased and platted a large portion of what was to become the Rosedale Park Historic District. This development company platted other projects in addition to Rosedale Park, most notably the North Rosedale Park neighborhood directly across Grand River Avenue. The company considered the location amenable to development because of its proximity to Grand River Avenue, a direct link to downtown Detroit, and the contemporaneous construction of Outer Drive. Interest in the new subdivision was immediate, and in 1917, the Rosedale Park Land Development Company platted an addition to the original area. However, the actual construction in the neighborhood was slow‚Äîfrom 1917 until the end of World War I, only 15 houses had been constructed. However, construction soon blossomed, and in 1921 a third addition was platted. The city of Detroit annexed the subdivision in 1926, bringing water and sewer to the neighborhood and making the area more attractive. Compared with other contemporary neighborhoods, such as Palmer Woods and the Grosse Pointes, Rosedale Park has more modest house and lot sizes reflecting the solidly middle- and upper-middle class status of the original homeowners. Many of these original homeowners were professionals, such as doctors and dentists, and accountants, or had white-collar jobs in the booming automobile industry. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, building in the area slowed, but in 1934, as the FHA made credit more available, construction again resumed, and another growth spurt in the neighborhood occurred in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the 1950s, there was a house on nearly every lot in the neighborhood. In the later part of the century, as the population in Detroit declined, Rosedale Park has remained a desirable neighborhood due to its high grade housing stock, charming setting and active neighborhood association. Description District location and boundary The Rosedale Park Historic District is residential in character. Primary streets run north-south, and major stone piers mark the primary entrances into the neighborhood. Traffic islands are placed in the center of many of the streets. Oak and maple trees, some planted in the 1910s and 1920s, line the streets. Private architects were only rarely engaged in Rosedale Park construction. Instead, buyers gained inspiration from mass-produced pattern books and house plans, or worked with construction companies to choose plans from their standard offerings. Between 1917 and 1955, houses were built in a multitude of styles, including English Tudor Revival, Arts and Crafts, Bungalow, Colonial Revival, Dutch Colonial, American Foursquare, Prairie, French Renaissance, Ranch, Garrison Colonial, Cape Cod and International style. However, an English country esthetic seems to have been encouraged (although not mandated) by the developers, and this seems to have influenced the renaming of many of the subdivision's streets, such as Glastonbury and Warwick, to names reflective of Merry Old England. Later houses built in the less prosperous late 1930s and early 1940s are less elaborate Colonial and Ranch styles, but even these tend to have Tudor Revival elements.

The Greek communities organized their own schools and churches and Greeks were active in trade, fishing, transport, coffee growing and the music industry. Also, a small group of Greek Jews emigrated to the Congo in the early 20th Century. History =Colonial Era= Dungu, Orientale Province. In the early to mid 20th century nearly all Congolese cities on the Belgian side had a Greek community and usually all hailing from a particular part of Greece as people would arrive, get settled in and send for their families.Gary Stewart, Rumba on the River, Verso, 2003, , ch. 2 By the 1920s there were established Greek fishing and trading communities in the trading cities of Luapula and Katanga, where the Greeks plied the river trade of the Congo, ranging as far as Zambia where many settled. The traders and fishermen developed a good and likable reputation and cultivated good relations with their Congolese and Zambian colleagues as they were always ready to offer help or lend their equipment and traditional Greek skills in net and boat making. Later the Congolese Greeks played a significant role in launching the country's important music tradition by founding several recording companies like Olympia, Ngoma, Opika and others. =Post- independence= When the country declared its independence in 1960 there were violent clashes and uncertainty followed by three decades of totalitarian rule by Mobutu Sese Seko which led to the exodus of most Greek settlers and the decline of the Greek community. Around the year 2000 there were about 100 Greeks left in the capital Kinshasa and 200 in Lubumbashi. The holy temple of Saint George and the Club Hellenique are the focal points of the community.Declan Walsh, City Life: Kisangani - Congo's last few Greeks look back in wonder, The Independent, (London), Oct 2, 2000 in 2006, 5,000 Greeks lived in the DR Congo.https://web.archive.org/web/20060619165420/http://www.ausgreeknet.com/greeksaroundtheglobe.htm Language Most Greeks speak French as their native language.

The remaining ruins include a Roman theater still in use today. It is sometimes referred to as Ronda la Vieja (Old Ronda) despite the fact that Acinipo and Arunda (the original settlement of Ronda) co-existed for centuries.Naturalis Historia, Pliny the Elder on Spain, Books 3 & 4  History  Roman baths of Acinipo. Some historians assert that Acinipo was created after the battle of Munda (45 BC), fought between the armies of Julius Caesar and the army of Pompey's two sons, Gnaeus and Sextus. To Caesar, Munda was supposed to be a mop-up action after Pompey's main forces were defeated in Greece. But Munda was no mop-up exercise. Tens of thousands of Romans were killed on both sides; there was no decisive victory for Caesar's armies; and one of Pompey's sons, Sextus, fled to fight another day as a famous rebel pirate against Caesar's successor, Augustus. Some Spanish historians state that Munda is the Roman name for Ronda, where the battle of Munda may have been fought. According to Pliny, the battle of Munda was fought in Osuna, about 50 km north of Ronda in the province of Seville. But there is general agreement that Acinipo was created for retired veterans of Caesar's legions, while Arunda (Ronda) would be a separate Roman outpost, perhaps created before the Munda conflict for the veterans of Pompey's legions. Ptolemy calls it a town of the Celtici in Hispania Baetica set on a lofty mountain.

It portrays the relationships and marriage of George, Prince Regent and his tense dealings with other members of his family such as his only child Princess Charlotte and his younger brother Frederick, Duke of York. It was also released as Affairs of a Rogue.The film is based on a play, The First Gentleman by Norman Ginsbury, which was staged in London in 1945, starring Robert Morley as the Prince Regent and Wendy Hiller as Princess Charlotte. The film title is taken from the Prince Regent's nickname, the First Gentleman of Europe. Plot The film traces the reign of the Prince Regent following the Napoleonic wars, and the Prince's attempts to marry off his unruly daughter Charlotte to a number of acceptable nobles, but to no avail because she falls for Leopold, a poverty-stricken German prince. Charlotte's marriage to Leopold is a happy one until the birth of their child. The film begins in Windsor Castle in 1810, with physicians telling the queen that King George III will not recover his sanity. They inform Prince George that he is to be Regent. The Prince Regent plans to marry his daughter Charlotte to Prince William of Orange. However, Charlotte shows more interest in Prince Leopold. The Orince Regent tries to force his opinion upon her. He himself is having an affair with Isabella. Charlotte leaves without permission to see her mother at Connaught House. The Bishop of Salisbury is sent to retrieve her. Henry Brougham is also sent to find her in a similsar role, representing the government. They all persuade her to go to Windsor Castle and stay with her grandmother, Queen Charlotte, for at least 18 months. Meanwhile on the continent, Prince Leopold meets Prince William of Orange, who informs him that his engagement to Charlotte was broken a long time before. Prince Leopold therefore returns to England. The Prince Regent is hosting a dinner at the newly completed Brighton Pavilion when a crowd begins to gather and cheer Princess Charlotte when she goes to the window to look at the fireworks but boo the Prince when he appears. His advisors tell him that if he let Charlotte marry Leopold he would be cheered. The Prince regent says that as the state would have to support Prince Leopold he is best placed as ruler of Hanover: but Charlotte insists that she and Leopold live in England. It is revealed that Leopold is waiting in the wings. Leopold and Charlotte marry and the Prince regent buys them Claremont House as a wedding present. Charlotte becomes pregnant. However, their son is stillborn. Moreover, Charlotte becomes desperately ill. She dies shortly before her father arrives. He is devastated: \\"two generations gone in a moment\\". He organises a funeral fit for a queen. 18 months later he is at the christening of his nephew Prince Edward's daughter, they debate calling her either Alexandrina or Charlotte, but fix upon Victoria. Cast Critical reception *TV Guide called it \\"a poorly mounted costume drama with a complicated script that moves at a snail's pace\\". *Allmovie wrote, \\"Swamped in period costumes and decor, Affairs of a Rogue is consistently good to look at, even when the plotline begins to drag.\\" References External links * 1948 films 1940s biographical drama films British biographical drama films British films English-language films Films directed by Alberto Cavalcanti Cultural depictions of George IV Films set in the 1810s Columbia Pictures films Films set in London 1940s historical drama films British historical drama films British films based on plays British black-and-white films 1948 drama films ","title":"The First Gentleman"},{"id":"20694616","text":"Doreen Spooner (30 January 1928https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/obituaries/doreen-spooner-dead.html ‚Äì 20 April 2019) was the first woman to work as a staff photographer on a Fleet Street newspaper during a forty-year career, mostly on the Daily Mirror. Career Born in North London on 30 January 1928, Spooner was encouraged in her career choice by her father Len, picture editor at the Daily Herald. Several other men in her family were employed on other papers. At the age of eight, her father bought her a five-shilling camera from Woolworth. After taking a photographic course at the Bolt Court School of Photography, Spooner worked briefly for the Keystone Picture Agency then joined the Daily Mirror from 1949, employed by Simon Clyne, picture editor, at a time when almost every woman employed by British newspapers was a typist or tea-lady.Theaker, Alison. The British Journal of Photography (Archive : 1860-2005)134.6597 (Jan 16, 1987)  Daily Mirror  In 1950, Spooner won the British News Picture of The Year award with her portrait of playwright George Bernard Shaw at his garden gate. She also photographed the young Princess Elizabeth for a portrait subsequently widely used in Britain's cinemas during the National Anthem as well as in international press at the time of the Accession. Spooner also photographed The Duke and Duchess of Windsor during the promotion of his book 'A King's Story'.  America  Despite these early successes, Spooner left the Mirror when offered the opportunity to tour America as a freelancer with the Keystone Agency, where she took pictures of Albert Einstein and the reclusive Amish communities as well as many studies of small town American life in the early 1950s. She then worked in Paris for Keystone and also for the new, iconoclastic Magnum Agency where she knew, and was inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa, both of whom had worked with her father in London. In Paris, she also met Pierre Vandeputte-Manevy (later one of the photographers of The Beatles)https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19800/lot/428/ and they married in 1952. They had three children and moved back to London in the late 1950s. Having largely retired from photography to raise her children, difficult personal circumstances forced Spooner to revive her career and she rejoined the Mirror in 1963 and remained there until her retirement in 1988.  Swinging London  Spooner's first front page scoop came in the summer of 1963 when, in a shadowy London pub, she surreptitiously snapped Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, the two notorious call girls at the heart of the Profumo Affair. In the 1960s and 70s, Spooner worked closely with Felicity Green, the Mirror's fashion editor, in promoting the revolutionary fashions and styles of 'Swinging London', photographing all the iconic figures of those years: Mary Quant, Vidal Sassoon, Barbara Hulanicki of Biba as well as the great models like Twiggy of whom Spooner was especially fond. 'It was simply impossible to take a bad photograph of her.' This was the heyday of the Daily Mirror, when it reached a circulation of around 5 million and celebrated with a party at the Royal Albert Hall, where The Beatles performed the cabaret. In the 1970s, Rupert Murdoch's Sun was eating steadily into the Mirror's circulation and the latter began to emulate the former's 'Page Three' photographs. None of the Mirror photographers enjoyed doing this, largely because they found it professionally uninteresting, though Spooner maintains that models like Samantha Fox and Linda Lusardi never felt exploited. One of them famously remarked 'You never mind getting your kit off for Doreen. It‚Äôs like undressing in front of your granny!‚Äô Spooner also photographed darker news stories including The 1984 Miner's Strike, The Zeebrugge Ferry Disaster, the Greenham Common Peace Camp and the Toxteth Riots. She also covered the royal tour of China in 1986 and was standing right beside Prince Philip when he made his famous 'slitty eyed' gaffe, chastising him for the comment. During her career at the Mirror, Spooner's roll-call of photographic subjects was vast and included Margaret Thatcher, Edward Heath, Leonard Bernstein, Tennessee Williams, Sophia Loren, Yves St. Laurent, Edith Sitwell, Freddie Mercury, Spandau Ballet, Diana Rigg and Shirley Bassey.

It should not be confused with a magazine published in 1983-1984 by McPheeters, Wolfe & Jones that was also titled Computer User, but with the subtitle \\"For the Tandy/Radio Shack System\\".  History  In the beginning years of publicly popular computer use, Computer User was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota as a free monthly magazine published by Computer User, Inc. a Minnesota corporation. Steven Bianucci, Publisher. Dale Archibald, Editor. Diane Teeters, Advertising Sales. Revenues were derived from advertising. Computer User took advantage of a tradition in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of placing free publication newsstands in business districts and stores. The magazine, printed originally in black and white with one spot color on newsprint, proved immediately popular with distribution, eventually hitting many hundreds of sites and a circulation around 25,000 in the Twin Cities for a full color piece on newsprint paper. It was then still free to pick up but could be subscribed for mail distribution for $34.95 per year. Computer User won numerous awards such as this from 2001 or as now listed on the current publishers website awards. Computer User became franchised to 18 metropolitan U.S. markets wherein Computer User provided content and the local publisher provided advertising and some local content. At some point, based on a reference from the University of Minnesota Library the publisher was Computer User Publications, Inc. Computer User was sold to M. S. P. Publications - a very successful Minneapolis-based magazine publisher. MSP published Computer User until 2004, when paper publication ceased and the enterprise and web based name rights were sold to ComputerUser, Inc. a New York State registered company.  Content  Computer User's style was, from the beginning, focused on the user of the then new micro computers. Nearly all other publications national and local focused on more the more technical aspects of having a computer, many of which were homebrew, assembled in part or in whole by the user. Computer User articles might include personal experiences, advice on how to use software, and expert advice columns. In the first decade before the Internet a very popular feature was a complete local list of computer bulletin boards. The monthly index of these, which frequently changed because they were usually based on someone's home computer, included the bbs name, a telephone number one could dialup with your computer modem, a list of the modem speed(s) offered (not all were as exists today. The most common speed available to home users then was 300 baud or \\"bits per second.\\"), and a summary of the topics or interests of those using the bulletin board. It was, in the 1980s and 1990s a form of social networking and a very important reason many people read the magazine. The magazine also published an equally popular index of Computer User Groups and their meeting schedules. Some were generic but others were focused on a single type of computer such as Tandy or Commodore. The magazine list enabled one to go to a meeting and ask other enthusiasts how to do things in a world where there was no other source. Therefore the magazine often published articles aimed at the groups and how to use them.

The 1517 fire destroyed the nave and damaged the tower of the original church. Afterwards it was designed and rebuilt by royal architect Benedikt Rejt. After it was finished in 1538, it became one of the supreme pieces of Czech late Gothic. The temple has three naves, with external support system, round arches and pyramid-shaped turrets.

The altar is divided into three parts ‚Äì the main one in the middle and two lateral, \\"optically\\" divided by huge screw-shaped columns ‚Äì each of the which is mastered by a painting on wood in the midsection. The carvings come to the stunning details ‚Äì the altar contains tens of characters of the biblical teachings, angels and baroque decor. Two of the tall Gothic stained glass windows with religious motives were donated by local citizens and date to the restorations from the break of 19th and the 20th century; the others have decent, non-figurative content. Tower The temple tower is 60 m tall. Sandstone was used as a building material. Inside the tower, there is a winding stairwell with approximately 180 stairs, leading to a belfry and the gallery with the view on the entire town and surrounding. In the belfry, there are two bells, each approximately 60 cm tall. Presently, the temple goes under minor amendments, however the church services and tours are not disrupted.

Solar radiation management (SRM) is a type of climate engineering in which sunlight (solar radiation) is reflected to limit or reverse global warming. Proposed methods include increasing the planetary albedo, for example using stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Restorative methods have also been proposed regarding the protection of natural heat reflectors including sea ice, snow, and glaciers. Their principal advantages as an approach to climate engineering is the speed with which they can be deployed and become fully active, their potential low financial cost, and the reversibility of their direct climatic effects. Solar radiation management could serve as a temporary response while levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are reduced through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon dioxide removal. SRM would not reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and thus does not address problems such as ocean acidification caused by excess carbon dioxide (CO2). However, as SRM can return global average temperatures to pre-industrial levels, it can prevent the climate change brought about by global warming. Purpose Climate engineering projects have been proposed in order to reduce global warming. As early as 1974, Russian expert Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. The annual cost of delivering a sufficient amount of sulfur to counteract expected greenhouse warming is estimated at to $8 billion US dollars. Scientists are postulating various ways in which mankind can hinder the detrimental effects of climate change and the warming of the planet. Researchers have proposed that increasing the Earth's albedo, or the reflectivity of the Sun's infrared rays, by spraying aerosols such as sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere could help eliminate the greenhouse gas effect. This phenomenon of cooling the Earth's surface by emissions occurs naturally in the world by the eruption of volcanoes. Some scientists believe that artificially producing the same emissions of volcanoes could mitigate the warming of the planet. A preliminary study by Edward Teller and others in 1997 presented the pros and cons of various relatively \\"low-tech\\" proposals to mitigate global warming through scattering/reflecting sunlight away from the Earth via insertion of various materials in the upper stratosphere, low earth orbit, and locations. By modifying the albedo of the Earth's surface, or by preventing sunlight reaching the Earth by using a solar shade, the sun's warming effect can be cancelled out‚Äîalthough the cancellation is imperfect, with regional discrepancies remaining. SRM or albedo modification, is considered to be a potential option for addressing climate change. As the National Academy of Sciences states in its 2015 report: \\"The two main options for responding to the risks of climate change involve mitigation‚Äîreducing and eventually eliminating human-caused emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)‚Äîand adaptation‚Äîreducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems to changes in climate. A third potentially viable option, currently under development but not yet widely deployed, is carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere accompanied by reliable sequestration. A fourth, more speculative family of approaches called albedo modification seeks to offset climate warming by greenhouse gases by increasing the amount of sunlight reflected back to space.\\" In this context, solar radiation management is widely viewed as a complement, not a substitute, to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. As The Royal Society concluded in its 2009 report: \\"Geoengineering methods are not a substitute for climate change mitigation, and should only be considered as part of a wider package of options for addressing climate change.\\" Or put another way: \\"The safest and most predictable method of moderating climate change is to take early and effective action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. No geoengineering method can provide an easy or readily acceptable alternative solution to the problem of climate change. Geoengineering methods could, however, potentially be useful in future to augment continuing efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions, and so should be subject to more detailed research and analysis.\\" By intentionally changing the Earth's albedo, or reflectivity, scientists propose that we could reflect more heat back out into space. We could also intercept sunlight before it reaches the Earth through a literal shade built in space. The effects are uncertain but it has been suggested that 2% albedo increase would roughly halve the effect of CO2 doubling. The National Academy of Sciences describes several of the potential benefits and risks of solar radiation management: \\"Modeling studies have shown that large amounts of cooling, equivalent in scale to the predicted warming due to doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, can be produced by the introduction of tens of millions of tons of aerosols into the stratosphere. ... Preliminary modeling results suggest that albedo modification may be able to counter many of the damaging effects of high greenhouse gas concentrations on temperature and the hydrological cycle and reduce some impacts to sea ice. Models also strongly suggest that the benefits and risks will not be uniformly distributed around the globe.\\" The applicability of many techniques listed here has not been comprehensively tested. Even if the effects in computer simulation models or of small-scale interventions are known, there may be cumulative problems such as ozone depletion, which become apparent only from large-scale experiments. Various small-scale experiments have been carried out on techniques such as cloud seeding, increasing the volume of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and implementing cool roof technology. SRM has been suggested to control regional climate, but precise control over the geographical boundaries of the effect is not possible. SRM projects could, for example, be used as a temporary response while levels of greenhouse gases can be brought under control by greenhouse gas remediation techniques but would not reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and thus not address problems such as ocean acidification caused by excess carbon dioxide (CO2).  Advantages  Solar radiation management has certain advantages relative to emissions cuts, adaptation, and carbon dioxide removal. Its effect of counteracting climate change would be experienced very rapidly, on the order of months after implementation, whereas the effects of emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal are delayed because the climate change that they prevent is itself delayed. Some proposed solar radiation management techniques are expected to have very low direct financial costs of implementation, relative to the expected costs of both unabated climate change and aggressive mitigation. This creates a different problem structure. Whereas the provision of emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal present collective action problems (because ensuring a lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a public good), a single country or a handful of countries could implement solar radiation management. Finally, the direct climatic effects of solar radiation management are reversible on short timescales. Limitations and risks As well as the imperfect cancellation of the climatic effect of greenhouse gases, there are other significant problems with solar radiation management as a form of climate engineering. SRM is temporary in its effect, and thus any long-term restoration of the climate would rely on long-term SRM, unless carbon dioxide removal was subsequently used. However, short-term SRM programs are potentially beneficial. = Incomplete solution to CO2 emissions = Solar radiation management does not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and thus does not reduce other effects from these gases, such as ocean acidification.http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/wingenter/Wingenter_PeECE_III_GRL_2007.pdf While not an argument against solar radiation management per se, this is an argument against reliance on climate engineering to the exclusion of greenhouse gas reduction. = Control and predictability = Most of the information on solar radiation management is from models and computer simulations. The actual results may differ from the predicted effect. The full effects of various solar radiation management proposals are not yet well understood. It may be difficult to predict the ultimate effects of projects,Keith Bower et al., 2006 Computational assessment of a proposed technique for global warming mitigation via albedo-enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds. Atmos. Res., vol. 82, no. 1-2, 2006, pp. 328‚Äì336 with models presently giving varying results. In the cases of systems which involve tipping points, effects may be irreversible. Furthermore, most modeling to date consider the effects of using solar radiation management to fully counteract the increase in global average surface temperature arising from a doubling or a quadrupling of the preindustrial carbon dioxide concentration. Under these assumptions, it overcompensates for the changes in precipitation from climate change. Solar radiation management is more likely to be optimized in a way that balances counteracting changes to temperature and precipitation, to compensate for some portion of climate change, and/or to slow down the rate of climate change. = Side effects = There may be unintended climatic consequences of solar radiation management, such as significant changes to the hydrological cycle that might not be predicted by the models used to plan them. Such effects may be cumulative or chaotic in nature. Ozone depletion is a risk of techniques involving sulfur delivery into the stratosphere. Not all side effects are negative, and an increase in agricultural productivity has been predicted by some studies due to the combination of more diffuse light and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. A recent (2019) study published in Nature Climate Change computer modeling tested results when solar geoengineering reduced by half the warming produced by doubling CO2 (half SG). The study concluded \\". . . neither temperature, water availability, extreme temperature nor extreme precipitation are exacerbated under half-SG when averaged over any Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extremes (SREX) region.\\" One study author, David Keith of Harvard University explains, \\"Big uncertainties remain, but climate models suggest that geoengineering could enable surprisingly uniform benefits.\\" = Termination shock = If solar radiation management were masking a significant amount of warming and then were to abruptly stop, the climate would rapidly warm. This would cause a sudden rise in global temperatures towards levels which would have existed without the use of the climate engineering technique. The rapid rise in temperature may lead to more severe consequences than a gradual rise of the same magnitude. = Disagreement = Leaders of countries and other actors may disagree as to whether, how, and to what degree solar radiation management be used, which could exacerbate international tensions. = Weaponization = In 1976, 85 countries signed the U.N. Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques. The Environmental Modification Convention generally prohibits weaponising climate engineering techniques. However, this does not eliminate the risk. If perfected to a degree of controllability and accuracy that is not considered possible at the moment, climate engineering techniques could theoretically be used by militaries to cause droughts or famines. Theoretically they could also be used simply to make battlefield conditions more favourable to one side or the other in a war. Carnegie's Ken Caldeira said, \\"It will make it harder to achieve broad consensus on developing and governing these technologies if there is suspicion that gaining military advantage is an underlying motivation for its development...\\" = Effect on sunlight, sky and clouds = Managing solar radiation using aerosols or cloud cover would involve changing the ratio between direct and indirect solar radiation. This would affect plant life; ; and solar energy. For the response of solar power systems, see It is believed that there would be a significant effect on the appearance of the sky from stratospheric aerosol injection projects, notably a hazing of blue skies and a change in the appearance of sunsets. Aerosols affect the formation of clouds, especially cirrus clouds.  Proposed forms  =Atmospheric= These projects seek to modify the atmosphere, either by enhancing naturally occurring stratospheric aerosols, or by using artificial techniques such as reflective balloons. Stratospheric aerosols Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere is the proposed solar radiation management method that has received the most sustained attention. This technique could give much more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is sufficient to entirely offset the warming caused by a doubling of CO2, which is a common benchmark for assessing future climate scenarios. Sulfates are the most commonly proposed aerosols for climate engineering, since there is a good natural analogue with (and evidence from) volcanic eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions inject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, which form sulfate aerosol and cool the planet. Alternative materials such as using photophoretic particles, titanium dioxide, and diamond have been proposed. Delivery could be achieved using artillery, aircraft (such as the high-flying F15-C) or balloons. Broadly speaking, stratospheric aerosol injection is seen as a relatively more credible climate engineering technique, although one with potential major risks and challenges for its implementation. Risks include changes in precipitation and, in the case of sulfur, possible ozone depletion. Marine cloud brightening Various cloud reflectivity methods have been suggested, (A brief handout, with artist's renderings.) such as that proposed by John Latham and Stephen Salter, which works by spraying seawater in the atmosphere to increase the reflectivity of clouds. The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray will change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter. The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to spray mist created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth. The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect. This technique can give more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is sufficient to reverse the warming effect of a doubling of CO2. Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement Enhancing the natural marine sulfur cycle by fertilizing a small portion with iron‚Äîtypically considered to be a greenhouse gas remediation method‚Äîmay also increase the reflection of sunlight. Such fertilization, especially in the Southern Ocean, would enhance dimethyl sulfide production and consequently cloud reflectivity. This could potentially be used as regional solar radiation management, to slow Antarctic ice from melting. Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect. =Terrestrial= Cool roof The albedo of several types of roofs Painting roof materials in white or pale colours to reflect solar radiation, known as 'cool roof' technology, is encouraged by legislation in some areas (notably California). This technique is limited in its ultimate effectiveness by the constrained surface area available for treatment. This technique can give between 0.01‚Äì0.19 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, depending on whether cities or all settlements are so treated. This is small relative to the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2. Moreover, while in small cases it can be achieved at little or no cost by simply selecting different materials, it can be costly if implemented on a larger scale. A 2009 Royal Society report states that, \\"the overall cost of a 'white roof method' covering an area of 1% of the land surface (about 1012 m2) would be about $300 billion/yr, making this one of the least effective and most expensive methods considered.\\" However, it can reduce the need for air conditioning, which emits CO2 and contributes to global warming. Reflective sheeting Adding reflective plastic sheets covering of desert every year between 2010 and 2070 to reflect the Sun's energy may be able to give globally averaged 1.74 W/m2 of negative forcing. Although insufficient to fully offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2, this would still be a significant contribution thereto, and would offset the current level of warming (approx. 1.7 W/m2). However, the effect would be strongly regional, and would not be ideal for controlling Arctic shrinkage, which is one of the most significant problems resulting from global warming. Furthermore, desert albedo modification would be expensive, would compete with other land uses, and would have strongly negative ecological consequences. Finally, the total area required during 2010‚Äì70 is larger than all non-polar deserts combined. Ocean changes Oceanic foams have also been suggested, using microscopic bubbles suspended in the upper layers of the photic zone. A less costly proposal is to simply lengthen and brighten existing ship wakes. Ice protection Arctic sea ice formation could be increased by pumping deep cooler water to the surface. Sea ice (and terrestrial) ice can be thickened by increasing albedo with silica spheres. Glaciers flowing into the sea may be stabilized by blocking the flow of warm water to the glacier. Salt water could be pumped out of the ocean and snowed onto the West Antarctic ice sheet.  Forestry  Reforestation in tropical areas has a cooling effect. Deforestation of high-latitude and high- altitude forests exposes snow and thus increases albedo.  Grassland management  Changes to grassland have been proposed to increase albedo. This technique can give 0.64 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2, but could make a minor contribution.  High-albedo crop varieties  Selecting or genetically modifying commercial crops with high albedo has been suggested. This has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, with farmers simply switching from one variety to another. Temperate areas may experience a 1 ¬∞C cooling as a result of this technique. This technique is an example of bio-geoengineering. This technique can give 0.44 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of CO2, but could make a minor contribution. =Space-based = Space-based climate engineering projects (space sunshades) are seen by many commentators and scientists as being very expensive and technically difficult, with the Royal Society suggesting that \\"the costs of setting in place such a space-based armada for the relatively short period that SRM geoengineering may be considered applicable (decades rather than centuries) would likely make it uncompetitive with other SRM approaches.\\"  Space mirrors  Proposed by Roger Angel with the purpose to deflect a percentage of solar sunlight into space, using mirrors orbiting around the Earth.  Moon dust  Mining moon dust to create a shielding cloud was proposed by Curtis Struck at Iowa State University in Ames.Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol 60, p 1  Dispersive solutions  The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. In reality, a 1000 kilometre diameter lens is enough, much smaller than what is shown in the simplified image. In addition, as a Fresnel lens it would only be a few millimeters thick. Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large diffraction grating (thin wire mesh) or lens in space, perhaps at the L1 point between the Earth and the Sun. Using a Fresnel lens in this manner was proposed in 1989 by J. T. Early. This proposal is also discussed in footnote 23 of Using a diffraction grating was proposed in 1997 by Edward Teller, Lowell Wood, and Roderick Hyde. In 2004, physicist and science fiction author Gregory Benford calculated that a concave rotating Fresnel lens 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%. He estimated that this would cost around US$10 billion up front, and another $10 billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.See Russell Dovey, \\"Supervillainy: Astroengineering Global Warming and Bill Christensen, \\"Reduce Global Warming by Blocking Sunlight\\" . One issue with implementing such a solution is the need to counteract the effects of the solar wind moving such megastructures out of position.  Governance  Climate engineering poses several challenges in the context of governance because of issues of power and jurisdiction. Climate engineering as a climate change solution differs from other mitigation and adaptation strategies. Unlike a carbon trading system that would be focused on participation from multiple parties along with transparency, monitoring measures and compliance procedures; this is not necessarily required by climate engineering. BengtssonBengtsson, L. (2006) 'Geo-engineering to confine climate change: is it at all feasible?' Climatic Change 77: 229‚Äì234 (2006) argues that \\"the artificial release of sulphate aerosols is a commitment of at least several hundred years\\". Yet this is true only if a long-term deployment strategy is adopted. Under a short-term, temporary strategy, implementation would instead be limited to decades. Both cases, however, highlight the importance for a political framework that is sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over such a long period and yet is flexible as the techniques innovate through time. There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, climate engineering has become a very political issue. Most discussions and debates are not about which climate engineering technique is better than the other, or which one is more economically and socially feasible. Discussions are broadly on who will have control over the deployment of climate engineering and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. This is especially important due to the regional variability of the effects of many climate engineering techniques, benefiting some countries while damaging others. The main challenge posed by climate engineering is not how to get countries to do it. It is to address the fundamental question of who should decide whether and how climate engineering should be attempted ‚Äì a problem of governance.Barrett, S (2007) Why cooperate? The incentive to supply global public goods. Oxford University Press, Oxford Solar radiation management raises a number of governance challenges. David Keith argues that the cost is within the realm of small countries, large corporations, or even very wealthy individuals. David Victor suggests that climate engineering is within the reach of a lone \\"Greenfinger,\\" a wealthy individual who takes it upon him or herself to be the \\"self-appointed protector of the planet\\". However, it has been argued that a rogue state threatening solar radiation management may strengthen action on mitigation. Legal and regulatory systems may face a significant challenge in effectively regulating solar radiation management in a manner that allows for an acceptable result for society. There are, however, significant incentives for states to cooperate in choosing a specific climate engineering policy, which make unilateral deployment a rather unlikely event. Some researchers have suggested that building a global agreement on climate engineering deployment will be very difficult, and instead power blocs are likely to emerge. Public attitudes There have been a handful of studies into attitudes to and opinions of solar radiation management. These generally find low levels of awareness, uneasiness with the implementation of solar radiation management, cautious support of research, and a preference for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. As is often the case with public opinions regarding emerging issues, the responses are highly sensitive to the questions' particular wording and context. One cited objection to implementing a short-term temperature fix is that there might then be less incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions until it caused some other environmental catastrophe, such as a chemical change in ocean water that could be disastrous to ocean life.Gregory Benford (Comments at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention, August 2006.) Ever since the idea of artificial cooling of planet was proposed, there has been major backlash and skepticism. Many people oppose the suggestion, but a recent study from the journal of Nature Climate Change has shown the speculation that solar geoengineering could cause extreme temperatures and increase severity of storms is actually incorrect. This journal shows that only 0.4% of places on the Earth would experience worsened weather conditions. Although no action has been carried out for spraying these gases and clouds into the atmosphere, this discovery could have a major influence on the course of action humans choose to take for reducing the greenhouse gas effect. Many critics and concerned scientists are whole-heartedly against the idea of solar geoengineering. A geophysics professor, Alan Robock, has reprimanded the Nature Climate Change journal for neglecting to mention other environmental effects that will occur from the atmospheric spray. Robock had said the choice to cool the Earth by artificial emissions would be very costly and it could serve a potential threat to different plant and animal species. Likewise, The Nature Ecology and Evolution journal predicted the use of aerosols would cause a quick transfer of temperatures from warm to cold which would not allow animals to move to a comfortable environment. Ultimately, it would cause a massive extinction of various animal and plant species. References Further reading *Granger Morgan, Katharine Ricke (2010).

Khwarazm, or the classical Chorasmia, was the well irrigated and rich agricultural region of lower Oxus.

Background  The Italian composer Luigi Boccherini was attached to the Court of the Spanish Infante, Luis Antonio (1727‚Äì85), brother of King Charles III of Spain (1759‚Äì88). For having married a common citizen, King Charles exiled the Infante from the Madrid Court to the Arenas de San Pedro palace in √Åvila province. As a courtier of Luis Antonio, Boccherini joined the exile, and found himself with much time for composition, and there completed more than one hundred pieces. Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid describes the bustling streets of night-time Madrid; about the composition, critic Jaume Tortella writes: :‚ÄúTaking its inspiration from nocturnal street scenes of Madrid, it seems to look back nostalgically to the gaiety and bustle of Spain‚Äôs capital, recalling the sound of the city‚Äôs church bells ringing for evening prayer, the popular dances that were the delight of its young people, and the blind beggars singing their typical viellas de rueda until the soldiers from the local garrison sound the midnight curfew with their Retreat.‚Äù The composition was famous in Spain during Boccherini's life; the best-known versions are arrangements of the Ritirata (Retreat) movement incorporated to the (G418) piano quintet, and the (G453) guitar quintet. The Night Music of the Streets of Madrid was published years after Boccherini's death, because, he told his publisher: ‚ÄúThe piece is absolutely useless, even ridiculous, outside Spain, because the audience cannot hope to understand its significance, nor the performers to play it as it should be played.‚Äù Since the mid-twentieth-century revival of interest in the music of Luigi Boccherini, the Ritirata became well-known; Luciano Berio used it as the basis for a composition superimposing the four known settings of the Ritirata, all playing concurrently, ebbing and flowing synchronously and asynchronously. Despite its slightly jokey nature, like Berio's folk-song settings, his Ritirata interpretation is attractive and approachable, acknowledging and expanding upon Boccherini's composition. In 1975, the Boccherini Quintet, on the Ensayo record label, recorded an exceptional interpretation of Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid, that in 1976 won the Grand Prix du Disque, by the Acad√©mie Charles Cros. Instrumentation Composed for two violins, a viola, and two cellos, the Night Music of the Streets of Madrid quintet is in the C major key, and is approximately 13 minutes in duration. Movements Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid comprises these movements: # Le campane de l‚ÄôAve Maria ‚Äì The Ave Maria Bell; the main church calls the faithful for the Ave Maria prayers. # Il tamburo dei Soldati ‚Äì The Soldiers‚Äô drum. # Minuetto dei Ciechi ‚Äì The Minuet of the Blind Beggars; Boccherini directed the cellists to place their instruments upon their knees, and strum them, like guitars. # Il Rosario (Largo assai, allegro, largo come prima) ‚Äì The Rosary, a slow section not played in strict time. # Passa Calle (Allegro vivo) ‚Äì The Passacaglia of the Street Singers, known as Los Manolos, lower-class loudmouths; not a true passacaglia, yet imitates their singing. In Spanish, pasacalle denotes ‚Äúpass along the street‚Äù, singing as one seeks amusement. # Il tamburo ‚Äì The drum. # Ritirata (Maestoso) ‚Äì The retreat of the Madrid military night watch; the Watch's patrol, announcing the curfew, and closing the streets for the night. Arrangements * In 1975, Luciano Berio composed Quattro versioni originali della \\"Ritirata notturna di Madrid\\", an arrangement of the last movement of this composition. Popular culture *The girlfriend of an undercover policeman plays a recording of Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid in the film Cruising (1980). *The ‚ÄúPassa calle‚Äù was played in the opening of Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympic Games; and is in the end of the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003). *The \\"Passa calle\\" was featured in the ending scene of Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking.(TV, 2004) *The \\"Passa calle\\" was featured in the opening scene and continued as a theme throughout episode 12 of The Good Wife \\"Alienation of Affection\\" of season 3.(original air date, Jan. 9, 2012) * In 2003, the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World uses the main violin theme from Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid extensively.

In 1868 the Pope Pius IX blesses a pair of crowns which are placed in the stained- glass window of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and the Congregation becomes an Archconfraternity. At the end of the 19th century, this devotion spreads throughout America and Europe, so the Vatican decides to make changes in the image, and begins the representation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus while still a child and in the arms of his mother, while Mary shows the heart of his son.Aspecto de Nuestra Se√±ora del Sagrado Coraz√≥n Prayer Remember, Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, what ineffable power thy divine Son hath given thee over His own adorable Heart.

He became a successful physician and his clients included the family of King George II of England. He was made a baronet in February 1730 becoming Sir Edward Wilmot, bart., of Chaddesden. Wilmot became the army's physician general and George III's physician. He resided at 18 Cork Street in Westminster.'Cork Street and Savile Row Area: Table of notable inhabitants on the Burlington Estate', Survey of London: volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2 (1963), pp. 566-572. url Date accessed: 14 December 2008 Early life The second son of Robert Wilmot and Joyce, daughter of William Sacheverell of Staunton, Leicestershire, he was born at his father's seat of Chaddesden near Derby on 29 October 1693. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. in 1714, was elected a fellow, took his M.A. degree in 1718 and M.D. in 1725. Physician He was admitted a candidate or member of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1725, and was elected a fellow on 30 September 1726. In 1729 and 1741 he was a censor, and a Harveian orator in 1735. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 29 January 1730. From 1725 he practised as a physician in London, and was elected physician to St. Thomas's Hospital, and in 1740 appointed physician-general to the army. In April 1731 he was appointed physician-extraordinary to Queen Caroline of Ansbach; and soon became physician in ordinary, and physician to Frederick, Prince of Wales. He became physician extraordinary to George II on the queen's death in 1737 and physician in ordinary 1742. In 1736 John Fothergill became his pupil. When Henry Pelham had lost two sons by sore throat in 1739, Wilmot preserved the life of his wife, Lady Catharine Pelham, by lancing her throat. In March 1751, with Matthew Lee, he attended Frederick, Prince of Wales, in his last illness; and does not seem to have anticipated his death. Archbishop Thomas Herring was his patient in a serious attack of pleurisy in 1753. Later life He was created a baronet on 15 February 1759. On the death of George II, Wilmot, with John Ranby, acquainted George III with two wishes which the late king had confided to them: that his body should be embalmed with a double quantity of perfumes, and that it should be laid close to that of the queen. George III at once assented. Wilmot became physician in ordinary to George III in 1760, left London next year, and lived in Nottingham; but then moved to Herringston in Dorset, where he died on 21 November 1786. He was buried in the church of Winterborne Monkton, where his epitaph remains. Family He married Sarah Marsh, daughter of Richard Mead. She died on 11 September 1785, aged 83; her portrait, painted by Joseph Wright, A.R.A., remained in the family, as did a portrait of Wilmot by Thomas Beach. He was succeeded in his baronetcy by his son, Robert Mead Wilmot, and had also two daughters, Ann(e) and Jane, who both married.A General and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, John Burke, p25, 1832, accessed 14 December 2008 References ;Attribution People from Chaddesden 1693 births 1786 deaths Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain 18th-century English medical doctors Fellows of the Royal Society Physicians-in-Ordinary Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge ","title":"Sir Edward Wilmot, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"20694995","text":"The Mina Mosque () or the Heavenly Mosque was built by Shah Jahan between 1631-40 near Diwan-i-Khas in Agra Fort.
