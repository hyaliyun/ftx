When sculpting the human figure, the armature is analogous to the major skeleton and has essentially the same purpose: to hold the body erect. An armature is often made of heavy, dark aluminium wire which is stiff, but can be bent and twisted into shape without much difficulty. The wire is affixed to a base which is usually made of wood. The artist then begins fleshing out the sculpture by adding wax or clay over the wire. Depending on the material and technique, the armature may be left buried within the sculpture but, if the sculpture is to be hollowed out for firing, it must be removed. Large representational sculptures meant for outdoor display are typically fashioned of bronze or other types of sheet metal, and they require armatures for internal support and stability. For example, a large armature designed by Gustave Eiffel holds up the Statue of Liberty. The armature can be seen from below by visitors to the base of the sculpture's interior.  Animation  Armature for Gromit of Wallace and Gromit An armature used in stop-motion animation is an articulated metal, wire or even wooden figure covered with material to build the character, but can be made to hold poses for extended periods of time. In 3D computer animation, the analogous concept is the skeleton or rig used in skeletal animation. See also * Lost wax Notes For this reason, much clay work for firing begins with a simple paper and/or wood armature. These materials can be removed relatively easily from finished piece while it is still fairly plastic, without damaging it. Any paper left behind will burn out in the kiln. A metal armature would expand in the heat and burst the piece.

The term is defined in IEEE P1363.2, in reference to one of the benefits of using a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol that is secure against off-line dictionary attacks. A ZKPP prevents any party from verifying guesses for the password without interacting with a party that knows it and, in the optimal case, provides exactly one guess in each interaction. Technically speaking, a ZKPP is different from a zero-knowledge proof. This is because a ZKPP is defined more narrowly than the more general zero-knowledge proof. ZKPP is defined in IEEE 1363.2 as \\"An interactive zero knowledge proof of knowledge of password- derived data shared between a prover and the corresponding verifier.\\" Notice, that the definition is concerned further with password-derived data. A common use of a zero-knowledge password proof is in authentication systems where one party wants to prove its identity to a second party using a password but doesn't want the second party or anybody else to learn anything about the password. History The first methods to demonstrate a ZKPP were the encrypted key exchange methods (EKE) described by Steven M. Bellovin and Michael Merritt in 1992.Bellovin 1992 A considerable number of refinements, alternatives, and variations in the growing class of password-authenticated key agreement methods were developed in subsequent years.

Umans, Fitzgerald's and Kingsley's Electric Machinery - 7th ed, McGraw Hill, 2014, , pp. 190 The armature windings conduct AC even on DC machines, due to the commutator action (which periodically reverses current direction) or due to electronic commutation, as in brushless DC motors. The armature can be on either the rotor (rotating part) or the stator (stationary part), depending on the type of electric machine. The armature windings interact with the magnetic field (magnetic flux) in the air-gap; the magnetic field is generated either by permanent magnets, or electromagnets formed by a conducting coil. The armature must carry current, so it is always a conductor or a conductive coil, oriented normal to both the field and to the direction of motion, torque (rotating machine), or force (linear machine). The armature's role is twofold. The first is to carry current across the field, thus creating shaft torque in a rotating machine or force in a linear machine. The second role is to generate an electromotive force (EMF). In the armature, an electromotive force is created by the relative motion of the armature and the field. When the machine or motor is used as a motor, this EMF opposes the armature current, and the armature converts electrical power to mechanical power in the form of torque, and transfers it via the shaft. When the machine is used as a generator, the armature EMF drives the armature current, and the shaft's movement is converted to electrical power. In an induction generator, generated power is drawn from the stator. A growler is used to check the armature for short and open circuits and leakages to ground.  Terminology  The word armature was first used in its electrical sense, i.e. keeper of a magnet, in mid 19th century. The parts of an alternator or related equipment can be expressed in either mechanical terms or electrical terms. Although distinctly separate these two sets of terminology are frequently used interchangeably or in combinations that include one mechanical term and one electrical term. This may cause confusion when working with compound machines like brushless alternators, or in conversation among people who are accustomed to work with differently configured machinery. In most generators, the field magnet is rotating, and is part of the rotor, while the armature is stationary, and is part of the stator. Both motors and generators can be built either with a stationary armature and a rotating field or a rotating armature and a stationary field. The pole piece of a permanent magnet or electromagnet and the moving, iron part of a solenoid, especially if the latter acts as a switch or relay, may also be referred to as armatures. Armature reaction in a DC machine In a DC machine, two sources of magnetic fluxes are present; 'armature flux' and 'main field flux'. The effect of armature flux on the main field flux is called \\"armature reaction\\". The armature reaction changes the distribution of the magnetic field, which affects the operation of the machine. The effects of the armature flux can be offset by adding a compensating winding to the main poles, or in some machines adding intermediate magnetic poles, connected in the armature circuit. Armature reaction is essential in amplidyne rotating amplifiers. Armature reaction drop is the effect of a magnetic field on the distribution of the flux under main poles of a generator. Since an armature is wound with coils of wire, a magnetic field is set up in the armature whenever a current flows in the coils. This field is at right angles to the generator field and is called cross magnetization of the armature. The effect of the armature field is to distort the generator field and shift the neutral plane. The neutral plane is the position where the armature windings are moving parallel to the magnetic flux lines, that is why an axis lying in this plane is called as magnetic neutral axis (MNA).Armature reaction in DC machines,  electricaleasy.com This effect is known as armature reaction and is proportional to the current flowing in the armature coils. The geometrical neutral axis (GNA) is the axis that bisects the angle between the centre line of adjacent poles. The magnetic neutral axis (MNA) is the axis drawn perpendicular to the mean direction of the flux passing through the centre of the armature. No e.m.f. is produced in the armature conductors along this axis because then they cut no flux. When no current is there in the armature conductors, the MNA coincides with GNA. The brushes of a generator must be set in the neutral plane; that is, they must contact segments of the commutator that are connected to armature coils having no induced emf. If the brushes were contacting commutator segments outside the neutral plane, they would short-circuit \\"live\\" coils and cause arcing and loss of power. Without armature reaction, the magnetic neutral axis (MNA) would coincide with geometrical neutral axis (GNA). Armature reaction causes the neutral plane to shift in the direction of rotation, and if the brushes are in the neutral plane at no load, that is, when no armature current is flowing, they will not be in the neutral plane when armature current is flowing. For this reason it is desirable to incorporate a corrective system into the generator design. These are two principal methods by which the effect of armature reaction is overcome. The first method is to shift the position of the brushes so that they are in the neutral plane when the generator is producing its normal load current. in the other method, special field poles, called interpoles, are installed in the generator to counteract the effect of armature reaction. The brush-setting method is satisfactory in installations in which the generator operates under a fairly constant load. If the load varies to a marked degree, the neutral plane will shift proportionately, and the brushes will not be the correct position at all times. The brush-setting method is the most common means of correcting for armature reaction in small generators (those producing approximately 1000 W or less). Larger generators require the use of interpoles. Winding circuits Coils of the winding are distributed over the entire surface of the air gap, which may be the rotor or the stator of the machine. In a \\"lap\\" winding, there are as many current paths between the brush (or line) connections as there are poles in the field winding. In a \\"wave\\" winding, there are only two paths, and there are as many coils in series as half the number of poles. So, for a given rating of machine, a wave winding is more suitable for large currents and low voltages.Gordon R. Slemon, Magnetoelectric Devices: Transducers, Transformers and Machines, John Wiley and Sons, 1966, no ISBN, pp. 248-249 Windings are held in slots in the rotor or armature covered by stator magnets. The exact distribution of the windings and selection of the number of slots per pole of the field greatly influences the design of the machine and its performance, affecting such factors as commutation in a DC machine or the waveform of an AC machine. A schematic winding diagram for a DC machine with a commutator, showing a wave winding - shown as if the surface of the armature was flattened out.  Winding materials  Armature wiring is made from copper or aluminum. Copper armature wiring enhances electrical efficiencies due to its higher electrical conductivity. Aluminum armature wiring is lighter and less expensive than copper.

Their single-lens reflex (SLR) system-cameras competed with Pentax, Hasselblad, Mamiya and others in the medium-format camera market. History Before introduction of the first of what would become a dynasty of Zenza Bronica cameras in 1959, the Latinized Zenza Bronica name was already a popular Japanese luxury goods brand of the Shinkodo Works (in Japanese: ) since 1947, specialized in the production of intricate crafted and decorated personal accessories, such as metal cigarette lighters and cases, cosmetic compacts, and watches, of diverse styles and designs. The company's founder Zenzabur≈ç Yoshino (in Japanese: , b. 25 January 1911 ‚Äî d. 23 November 1988), wherefrom the Latinized Zenza Bronica brand name is derived, was the third son born into a Japanese rice merchant family. At an early age Yoshino showed deep reverence for the technical innovation and mechanics of world-renowned cameras produced by the likes of Leica, Contax and Rollei. Both fascinated and yet increasingly frustrated by the limitations of the cameras produced at that time period, where each camera's merits and demerits were not solved by just one camera, Yoshino visioned creating a high-precision interchangeable single- lens reflex camera modular system of his own design. Yoshino's ambition, however, would require substantial investment, which he gradually self-funded from his family business in transportation and his passion for cameras by the establishment of a small camera store in Tokyo's Kanda district. Yoshino's camera store and his immense familiarity with deluxe foreign cameras became a huge success with photography enthusiasts in Japan, buying and selling luxury Leica and Contax cameras, which also gained popularity with US Army soldiers stationed in Japan after World War II. This formed the funding basis for his founding in 1947 of the Shinkodo Works with a vision of camera production, which at first produced Bronica brand luxury art deco accessories such as cigarette lighters and cases including watches, and positioned Bronica as a luxury brand in Japanese department stores, with popularity thriving among US Army soldiers in Japan. The Shinkodo Works was Yoshino's precursor production base and funding source for what would later serve his Bronica camera and photographic equipment manufacturing; later consolidated under the Zenza Bronica Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha (Zenza Bronica Industries, Inc) company.Canadian trade-mark data record; Application No. 0305181, Registration No. TMA156856 On 17 January 1952, the Shinkodo Works was directed by Yoshino to begin research and development of the Bronica prototype camera. =Film camera production= The prototype was a modular camera named the \\"Yoshino Flex\\". In June 1956 the Shinkodo Works created its first handmade example camera, and on reaching perfection in October 1958 with Yoshino's eighth prototype camera, the development costs had reached a sum of 200 million Yen, a huge sum at that time. The final prototype bore the Latinized nameplate \\"ZENZA BRONICA\\"‚Äîthe Bronica Z (Zen-za) rollfilm camera‚Äîand first appeared at the Philadelphia Camera Show in March 1959, where it received ecstatic industry press coverage and left a deep lasting impression of being the world's dream camera. The Bronica Z modular camera system, shortly later with slight modifications renamed the Zenza Bronica D (Deluxe) and successor Bronicas, using large-coverage film format, high-quality Nikkor lenses supplied by the then Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd., (Nikon Corporation) became instant successes in the deluxe camera market worldwide. The Bronica D was the Japanese answer and first serious challenger to the Swedish Hasselblad cameras, and in several technical ways outclassed the Swedish offerings. Such was the design success of Bronica, that in the United States it attracted influential figures from the photographic industry such as Burt Keppler who met with Yoshino. Bronica later introduced optics and lens units of its own manufacture incorporating Seiko shutters with its later camera designs and held a portfolio of international patents. =Acquisition and product discontinuation= Bronica was eventually acquired by the lens manufacturer Tamron Co., Ltd., in 1998 with emphasis on Bronica's optical lens manufacturing. In May 2000, Tamron introduced under the Bronica brand the RF645 rangefinder camera. Tamron discontinued the brand's single-lens reflex camera models (ETRSi, SQ-Ai, SQ-B and GS-1) between June 2002 and December 2004, sales having suffered from the lack of consideration to a digital camera back and loss of market share to digital photography and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, particularly for the wedding and portrait photography business which had previously been a heavy user of medium-format photographic film but switched quickly to digital photography for its commercial workflow benefits. Bronica's last model, the RF645 rangefinder camera, was discontinued in September 2005, and marked the termination of the Bronica camera brand business. Bronicas were workhorse photographic film cameras used by professional photographers for many years until the process of digital photography became widely adopted. Bronica cameras are, however, still widely used by photographers‚Äîboth professional and advanced amateurs‚Äîwhilst the commercial production of photographic 120 film remains available, in no small part due to superior image quality of 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7cm photographic film formats over smaller film (35mm) and digital image sensor formats. =JCII camera museum= The Japan Camera and Optical Instruments Inspection and Testing Institute (JCII) at its camera museum located in Ichibanch≈ç district, central Tokyo, has a selection of Bronica camera models preserved among its museum display collections; as part of the museum's designation \\"preserving cameras considered of historical significance\\".JCII Camera Museum Bronica models Bronica SLR system-cameras employed a modular design: The major components of the camera‚Äîlens, body, film-back and viewfinder were separate and interchangeable, providing options to match the specific photography or workflow needs of the photographer. =Classic models= Classic Zenza Bronica S2 with Zenzanon 100mm f2.8 lens From its start, Bronica introduced a number of 6x6 cm medium-format SLR cameras with focal plane shutter, which used Nikkor lenses from Nikon, until this line was discontinued with the introduction of the successor Bronica SQ-series. These models included: * Bronica Z (Zen-za), debuted March 1959 at the Philadelphia Camera Show and renamed Bronica D (Deluxe) in December 1959 with slight modifications; production discontinued March 1961 * Bronica S (Standard), introduced April 1961; production discontinued April 1965 * Bronica C (Compact), introduced December 1964; production discontinued May 1965 * Bronica C2, introduced May 1965; production discontinued September 1972 * Bronica S2, introduced July 1965, S2A (introduced 1969), S2A type 2 (introduced 1972); production discontinued September 1977 * Bronica EC (Electrical Control), introduced April 1972; production discontinued December 1978 * Bronica EC-TL (Electrical Control with Through-the-Lens aperture priority automatic exposure), introduced June 1975, EC-TL II (introduced October 1978); production discontinued March 1980 Notably, the Bronica EC was the first medium-format SLR camera with an electrically operated focal plane shutter (Japan Patent No.: 43/94431 24 December 1968; US Patent No. US3696727Zenza Bronica US Patent No. US3696727, Electrically Operated Focal Plane Shutter), while the EC-TL was the first medium-format camera with Aperture priority automatic exposure (AE). The range of Nikkor lenses for these remarkable cameras reached from 30mm (fisheye) to 1200mm and comprised about 30 lenses. Lens optics supplied by Carl Zeiss in Jena, Tokyo Optical Co., Ltd., Norita optics, Komura-Komuranon (Sankyo Kohki), Schneider Kreuznach, as well as lens optics later manufactured by Bronica itself based on designs by Zeiss and Japanese lens manufacturers were available, as well as a wide range of accessories, including different film magazines, bellows, and viewfinders. =ETR series= Zenza Bronica ETRS with Zenzanon EII 75mm f2.8 lens ETRSi 40th anniversary edition in champagne metallic colour, with manual shutter-release handgrip and metered prism viewfinder attached, released 9 May 1999 * ETR: Introduced March 1976, production discontinued March 1980. Advanced, compact, modular electronic 6x4.5 cm medium-format SLR camera system with a vast array of finders, film- backs, and other accessories. ETR was an acronym for Electronic, TTL-metering, Reflex. In 1977 the ETR received Japan's Good Design Award. Seventeen lenses with leaf shutters were made for the ETR-system from a fisheye, to four different zooms, to a 500mm super telephoto, to a unique 55mm tilt shift lens. * ETR-C: Introduced November 1977, production discontinued December 1980. Identical to the ETR model except film magazine cannot be removed from film- back. * ETRS: Introduced October 1978. Improved version of the ETR with an extra contact to support auto-exposure mode with the metered prism finder AE- II and later AE-III. ** ETRS: A modification introduced July 1982, ETRS production discontinued September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens release sliding lever latch located to left side of camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly referred to as the \\"plastic\\" body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate. * ETRC: Introduced October 1978 (ETRC), production discontinued October 1980 (ETRC) Identical to the ETRS model except film magazine cannot be removed from film-back. * ETRSi: Introduced December 1988, production discontinued December 2004. Improved version of the ETRS with mirror lock-up capability. Capable of through-the- lens off-the-filmplane (TTL-OTF) flash exposure. Significantly improved film- back design (Si) with locking darkslide. =SQ series= Zenza Bronica SQ-Ai with Zenzanon-PS f4 40mm lens Polaroid Land pack film, using exclusive film- backs for each film type. * SQ: Introduced August 1980 as replacement and successor to Bronica's classic and increasingly bulky Nikkor-lens based cameras, production discontinued September 1984. Modular 6x6 cm traditional \\"square film\\" medium-format SLR camera system with leaf shutter lenses. * SQ-A: Introduced January 1982, production discontinued December 1991. The SQ-A was a refinement of the SQ. The contact pin array for the viewfinder was increased from six to ten gold contacts, allowing for auto metering capability with the AE finder S. Also, a mirror lock-up lever was added. The film-backs were modified slightly, with the ISO dial for the original film-backs having white and orange numerals, and the new with silver. The darkslide was changed to the locking style; to lock required both the new grey handle slide and the new silver numeral ISO dial back. All accessories for SQ cameras fit the SQ-A, however the AE finder cannot physically mount on the SQ; a safety defeat pin prevents attachment. * SQ-Am: Introduced August 1982, production discontinued March 1991. Motorized film-advance only version of SQ-A body. Uses six additional AA batteries. * SQ-Ai: Introduced December 1990, production discontinued December 2003. Added the following functionality to the SQ-A. Ability to add the motor drive SQ-i and off the film (TTL-OTF) metering with select flash guns. These changes required the addition of a circuit board which also required the battery compartment to be \\"flattened.\\" The single 6v cell was replaced with four 1.5 volt \\"button\\" cells. A bulb 'B' setting was added to the shutter speed selector. The film-back was also modified again with the introduction of the SQ-Ai, relocating the ISO dial to the rear of the film-back (rather than on top) to allow the speed setting to be seen better with a prism attached. Exposure compensation control was also added to the new SQ-Ai film-back, with the ISO range extended to 6400. Tamron Bronica Learning Center SQ Guide * SQ-B (Basic): Introduced April 1996, production discontinued December 2003. The SQ-B was a manually operating SLR evolved from the SQ-Ai, built to primarily satisfy the needs of professional \\"studio\\" photographers who work with hand-held light meters, studio or portable flash equipment and various other accessories. Thus, motorized film-advance and through-the-lens metering (TTL) functionality were not present, as well as B (bulb exposure) and T (time exposure), as found on other SQ-series models. T (time exposure), however, was available when utilizing the appropriate SQ-series Zenzanon-S/PS lenses which incorporated the time (T) exposure lever function; by default the Zenzanon-PS/B 80mm f/2.8 lens which accompanied the SQ-B model did not include this feature. All SQ-series accessories and lenses were interchangeable with the SQ-B with few exceptions. =GS series= * GS-1: Introduced April 1983, production discontinued June 2002. Lightweight, electronically controlled, modular 6x7 cm medium-format SLR camera system with leaf shutter lenses, four interchangeable viewfinders, speed grip, and optional film-backs for Polaroid Land pack film, 6x4.5 cm, 6x6 cm, and 6x7 cm rollfilm. 120 and 220 size film- backs available in 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7 cm. A 35mm film-back was listed in the camera's marketing materials, but never materialized. Dedicated Flash (G1). The GS-1 uses \\"PG\\"-series lenses in a variety of focal lengths: 50mm, 65mm, 80mm, 100mm, 110mm macro, 150mm, 200mm, 250mm, and 500mm. =RF series= * RF645: Introduced May 2000, production discontinued September 2005. Extremely light and compact 6x4.5 cm film format coupled rangefinder camera system with four interchangeable leaf shutter lenses: 45mm, 65mm, 100mm and 135mm. The 135mm Tele Lens soon was discontinued due to calibration problems of the rangefinder-system. Dedicated flash (RF20) and special polarizer kit.

Also that month, likely due to the public outcry of a \\"gangland-style\\" drive by shooting of a Ballard High School student (which some blamed hip hop music and a growing gangster culture in Seattle as a motivator behind it), as well as their audience's changing music tastes, KUBE shifted to a hybrid Rhythmic/Modern Rock format as simply \\"KUBE 93.\\" The station began using the slogans \\"Seattle's New Music Revolution\\" and \\"Channel X,\\" a popular way to identify modern rock stations at the time. However, the station's ratings were not impressive with the format, and by November of that year, the station flipped back to a full-blown Rhythmic format. The station quickly regained its top 10 status, usually peaking at #1 in several books for the next several years. In February 1998, the Ackerley Group bought the station outright from New Century. For many years, KUBE marketed itself as \\"Seattle's #1 Hit Music Station, KUBE 93.\\" iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications) purchased KUBE, along with sister stations KJR, KJR-FM, KFNK and outdoor advertiser AK Media, from Ackerley Communications in 2001. On April 1, 2009, Clear Channel acquired Top 40 rival KBKS from CBS Radio. At the time, KUBE was competing against Rhythmic AC station KQMV (Movin' 92.5), owned by Sandusky. KUBE changed its slogan to \\"More Non-Stop Music,\\" and then to \\"Hits & Hip- Hop\\". KUBE was the home of The T-Man Show morning show, which aired from September 1995 to September 2009, when \\"The T-Man\\" retired to become a professional poker player. The show featured Robert \\"The T-Man\\" Tepper, who was known for never showing his face to audiences, as well as co-hosts Pasty Dave (who was the show's producer), Hot Shot Scott, Dump Truck Guy, Ham Sandwich Man, Stephen Kilbreath, Vinnie The Pooh and Tari Free. The show was also briefly syndicated through Premiere Radio Networks, and was heard on KKRZ in Portland, KYLD in San Francisco and several other cities. Shellie Hart, longtime midday DJ and music director for the station, was let go in November 2011 due to budget cuts issued by Clear Channel. Hart had been with the station since 1991, except for a brief 3-year period between 1996 and 1999, when Hart programmed modern rock station KEDJ Phoenix. Hart is currently at KRWM. Despite many years of high ratings, around 2011, however, KUBE's ratings began declining, largely due to poor programming and marketing decisions. KUBE was also no exception to company-wide budget cuts at Clear Channel, with several long-time personalities replaced with voicetracked talent from outside of the market. New competition from KQMV and KHTP took away some of KUBE's listeners. KUBE also rotated through a few morning shows after The T-Man Show ended, such as Eddie Francis & Karen Wild, The JV Show (syndicated from sister KYLD), The Breakfast Club, and DJ SupaSam. None of these programming changes resulted in any ratings improvement for the station. In the December 2015 Nielsen ratings period for the Seattle market, KUBE was ranked #13 with a 2.3 share. Causes and Effects of iHeart's Seattle Shuffle =Power 93.3= Logo as \\"Power 93.3\\", from January 19, 2016 through May 3, 2018 As part of a major format shuffle involving four of iHeart's Seattle radio stations, on January 19, 2016, at Noon, after playing \\"Whatever You Like\\" by T.I., KUBE's long-time Rhythmic CHR format and branding moved to lower-power sister station KKBW (104.9 FM), displacing that station's Active Rock format. At the same time, 93.3 adopted KBKS's Mainstream CHR format, added in some newer rhythmic titles to the playlist, and rebranded as \\"Power 93.3.\\" The first song on \\"Power\\" was \\"Sorry\\" by Justin Bieber. This returned the 93.3 frequency in Seattle to a Top 40/Mainstream format for the first time in nearly 24 years. The station also brought in a new live and local air staff which included Carla Marie & Anthony for mornings, Kat Fisher for middays, Kwame Dankwa on afternoon drive and Brady for evenings. The station took on the KPWK call letters on January 26, 2016; the KUBE call letters moved to KKBW the same day. Ratings did not improve much, with the station usually ranked in the mid-2 to mid-3 share of the market. Meanwhile, KQMV saw a big ratings boost at the time, sometimes finishing in first place. In the April 2018 ratings, KPWK was ranked #18 with a 2.8 share, well behind KQMV, which had a 6.8 share. =Return of KUBE= On May 3, 2018, at 3 p.m., after playing \\"Wait\\" by Maroon 5, KPWK flipped back to Rhythmic CHR, returning to the \\"KUBE\\" branding, as \\"KUBE 93.3.\\" The first song on the revived KUBE was \\"Nice for What\\" by Drake. Concurrently with the move, KBKS also returned to its previous Mainstream Top 40 format, effectively reversing the ill-fated 2016 format changes. The KUBE call letters returned on May 11, 2018. Positioned as \\"Seattle's #1 for Hip Hop,\\" the playlist is focused on current hip hop hits as well as some gold/re-current hip hop titles from the 1990s and 2000s. Audio of KUBE Relaunch - Lucas Nugent HD Radio KUBE broadcasts in the HD Radio format. When KUBE signed on HD operations in 2006, KUBE's HD2 sub-channel carried a hip hop format branded as \\"KUBE 2.\\" In 2009, it was replaced with a broad-based Rhythmic format known as \\"WiLD\\". The \\"WiLD\\" format was patterned after most Clear Channel owned Rhythmic Top 40 stations by playing Mainstream Rhythmic Pop/Dance tracks and very few Hip Hop/R&B; tracks. This would later be replaced with a children's radio format branded as \\"Kids Club Radio.\\" From December 11, 2017 through May 3, 2018, KPWK-HD2 carried the rhythmic CHR format as \\"KUBE 93 HD2,\\" after the 104.9 frequency was divested. After KUBE was revived on the analog/HD1, KUBE-HD2 flipped to a classic hip hop format. On June 26, 2019, KUBE-HD2 changed to iHeart's \\"Pride Radio\\" network, which airs Top 40/Dance music targeting the LGBTQ community. This marks the second such format in Seattle, the other being Entercom's \\"Channel Q\\" format airing on KNDD-HD2/K277AE. iHeartMedia Expands Pride Radio to 12 Additional Markets References External links *KUBE 93.3 official website * UBE (FM) Category:Rhythmic contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in Washington (state) Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"KUBE (FM)"},{"id":"2152355","text":"In chess, an exchange variation is a type of opening in which there is an early, voluntary exchange of pawns or pieces. Such variations are often quieter than other lines because the early release of tension minimizes the possibility of surprise tactics or sharp, forcing lines, particularly where it results in a symmetrical pawn structure. Intents and implications White may choose an exchange variation as a relatively risk-free way to try to exploit White's first-move advantage. Players such as Mikhail Botvinnik and Yasser Seirawan used the Exchange Variation of the Slav Defense this way. White may also play an exchange variation in an effort to draw the game. This approach is not without risks. International Master John L. Watson has written that in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, \\"Black can always make the struggle an unbalanced one if he chooses\\".John L. Watson, Play the French, Pergamon Press, 1986, p. 28. . Moreover, playing so blatantly for a draw may place a psychological burden on White: \\"White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and he knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative.\\"Watson 1986, p. 29. Not all exchange variations are quiet; the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld Defense is regarded as one of White's sharpest and most aggressive options, since it allows White to build up a massive pawn center, which Black will try to undermine. The Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined often involves attacks by one or both sides on the enemy king. Exchange variations involving the exchange of pawns often lead to symmetrical central pawn structures, as in the Slav Defense and the French Defense, among others. The resulting pawn structures may also be asymmetrical, as in the Caro-Kann Defense and Queen's Gambit Declined. In the Ruy Lopez, Exchange Variation pieces (White's bishop and Black's knight) rather than pawns are traded. In the Exchange Variation of the Grunfeld Defense, both a pair of pawns and a pair of knights are traded. The diagram at right shows a position in the Exchange Variation of the French Defense, after the moves: :1. e4 e6 :2. d4 d5 :3. exd5 exd5 The position is completely symmetrical and White's advantage is limited to his right to move. The Exchange French is usually regarded as a passive alternative selected by a White player eager for a draw, but Paul Morphy and more recently Garry Kasparov have used it as a winning try.

The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1994 and in North America and PAL regions in 1995. It is the direct sequel to Mega Man X, released one year prior. Mega Man X2 takes place in the near future in which humans try to peacefully coexist with intelligent robots called \\"Reploids\\", with some of the Reploids going \\"Maverick\\" and threatening daily life. The plot follows the android protagonist X, a \\"Maverick Hunter\\" who has saved humanity from the evil Sigma six months earlier. A trio of Mavericks calling themselves the \\"X-Hunters\\" has arisen, intent on destroying X by luring him with bodyparts of his comrade Zero, who died in the conflict with Sigma. Mega Man X2 features much of the same action- platforming elements as the first installment of the series, following the traditional gameplay of the original Mega Man series. The player is tasked with completing a series of stages by destroying enemies, gaining various power-ups, and winning the special weapon of each stage's boss. Like the first Mega Man X, this game lets the player dash, scale walls, and obtain access to special abilities via optional pieces of armor. Mega Man X2 is graphically similar to its predecessor as well, but Capcom included the Cx4 in-cartridge enhancement chip to allow for some 3D wireframe effects. The development team was instructed to utilize this technology as much as possible when working on the game. The presentation and gameplay of Mega Man X2 have earned the game a mostly positive critical reception. However, reviewers were dismayed by the lack of changes from the original Mega Man X. The game has since gone onto being released on various other platforms. Plot Mega Man X2 is set in an ambiguous year during the 22nd century (\\"21XX\\") in which the world is populated both by humans and mechanical beings known as \\"Reploids\\" (replicant androids). The mass-produced Reploids are based on a complex, humanoid robot dubbed Mega Man X (or simply \\"X\\") who was discovered by the archaeologist Dr. Cain in laboratory ruins many months earlier. Created with human-level intelligence and free will, some Reploids have a tendency towards destructive, criminal activity and are subsequently dubbed \\"Mavericks\\" by the government. A military force called the \\"Maverick Hunters\\" is formed to halt or prevent such activity. The events of the first Mega Man X game entail the hunter X's fight to stop Sigma, a Maverick overlord bent on the destruction of humanity. X prevails in his mission, but at the cost of his partner Zero's life. Six months following the incident, X becomes the head of the Maverick Hunters. X tracks a \\"manufactured Maverick\\" bearing Sigma's emblem to a Reploid factory, where he launches a full assault. However, despite Sigma's apparent death and X's recent efforts, the Maverick rebellion continues. Three powerful Mavericks‚ÄîSerges, Agile, and Violen‚Äîform a group called the \\"X-Hunters\\" and gain control of the North Pole. In the time between Sigma's demise and the trio's sudden uprising, Serges has collected the deceased Zero's bodyparts. After the factory mission, X is assigned to seek and exterminate eight Maverick leaders on a large continent directly south of the North Pole. The X-Hunters contact the Maverick Hunters shortly thereafter and taunt them with Zero's body. The X-Hunters drift among the eight Maverick locations and attempt to lure X out, each one promising the protagonist a piece of Zero if he can defeat them. The story deviates slightly depending on whether or not the player collects all three of Zero's parts before heading to the X-Hunter fortification in the North Pole. If the player gathers all the parts, Dr. Cain states he will attempt to reassemble and reactivate Zero using his original control chip. If the player does not succeed, X is informed by Dr. Cain that the X-Hunters have attacked Maverick Hunter headquarters and stolen any collected parts and the control chip. Just as X annihilates the last of the X-Hunters, Sigma reveals himself to have been behind the plot. X leaves the exploding compound and tracks Sigma to the Central Computer, one of the eight locations he visited earlier. If the player fails to collect all of Zero's parts, X finds both Sigma and the newly rebuilt Zero waiting for him halfway through the stage. X must then beat Zero in combat. If the player does manage to collect all of the parts, a gray-armored clone of Zero accompanies Sigma instead; the real Zero then appears at X's side and destroys the clone. The outcome of either event has Sigma retreating and Zero creating a passageway in the floor to allow X pursuit. After X defeats Sigma, he reveals to X that his true form exists as a computer virus, and taunts to X that he will return. However, Sigma questions Zero's allegiance with humans, stating that Zero is \\"the last of the Doctor's creations\\". X evacuates the facility to rendezvous with Zero outside, and the two watch as the facility self-destructs. Gameplay The player obtains the hidden X-Buster upgrade in Wheel Gator's stage. Mega Man X2 is an action-platform game in the same fashion as the first Mega Man X and the original Mega Man series. The player takes on the role of the titular character X, who must traverse and clear a series of eight, side- scrolling stages in the order of the player's choosing. The protagonist's initial abilities include running, jumping, scaling walls, dashing forward to make longer jumps, and firing his chargeable \\"X-Buster\\" arm cannon. Unlike Mega Man X, the dash is a permanent ability at the start of the game, instead of being an armor upgrade found in a capsule. The player must contend with countless robotic enemies and several platforming hazards such as bottomless pits, deadly spikes, and rising lava. Along the way, the player can pick up extra lives and items that restore health and weapon power. Each stage contains one main boss at the end; defeating the stage's boss will earn the player a special weapon that can be quickly switched to and used in any remaining levels. Every boss is weak to another's weapon, so the player may strategize the order in which the stages are completed. Mega Man X2 features a number of extra gameplay elements. At certain times, the player can pilot vehicles including an attack mech in Wheel Gator's stage and an attack hovercycle in Overdrive Ostrich's stage. Each of the eight stages contains an optional entrance for a battle with one of the three X-Hunters, should the player select that stage when one of them is present. Defeating an X-Hunter will earn the player a piece of Zero, which may affect the storyline late in the game. Like the first Mega Man X, players can locate and acquire numerous hidden power-ups. \\"Heart Tanks\\" extend the player's maximum life bar, \\"Sub- Tanks\\" store life energy for later use, and armor upgrade capsules grant a set of new abilities. For example, the leg part will allow the player to perform a dash in mid-air, while the X-Buster part will allow for two charged blasts in succession. When specific conditions are met a special capsule is unlocked in one of the game's final stages, allowing X to perform a one-shot kill attack (the \\"Shoryuken\\") used by characters from Capcom's Street Fighter series. Development Mega Man X2 was developed by a team at Capcom, which included artists Hayato Kaji and Keiji Inafune, as well as designers Sho Tsuge, and Yoshihisa Tsuda. A majority of the people who worked on Mega Man X2 had either been heavily involved with the development of the first Mega Man X or were completely new to the franchise. Inafune was \\"hands-off\\" with the art design in Mega Man X2. He instead began focusing more on planning, producing, and story writing for the newer series beginning with this title. According to Tsuda, it was Inafune's decision to bring Zero back to life in Mega Man X2 simply because he thought it would be \\"a shame\\" to keep him dead. Inafune felt particularly attached to Zero, a character whom he had designed and originally intended to be the main protagonist of the X series. Even though Inafune had mostly relinquished his character design duties in Mega Man X2, he refused to allow any drastic changes to the illustration of Zero. The game's antagonists, the X-Hunters, were present as several illustrations within Inafune's sketchbook prior to the completion of the first Mega Man X. Their aesthetic features were combined to create the basis for Sigma's design in Mega Man X; the three designs were then fleshed out as three separate characters for the sequel. The team had planned to include a fourth, female X-Hunter and were going to denote them as the \\"Four Guardians\\". However, both this character and Violen's second form were cut from the final version of the game due to a lack of resources. In creating the eight, ancillary Maverick bosses, the development team considered holding public, fan submissions as they had done with several games in the original Mega Man series. They ultimately decided against the idea as they wanted to further establish a contrast between the two series. Tsuge elaborated, \\"With Mega Man, we wanted the players to feel a certain familiarity with the characters, but it was our intention that the X series would have a world with a more hardcore feel to it. We didn't want the bosses in this world to be cute products of kids' imaginations, we needed them to be solid characters refined by professionals.\\" Mega Man X2 has an in- cartridge enhancement by Capcom called the Cx4 chip, a digital signal processor which allows for limited 3D graphical effects like rotation, enlarging, and shrinking of wireframe objects. The company held weekly meetings devoted to utilizing the chip to its maximum potential in Mega Man X2. Tsuge commented that the Cx4 was their \\"greatest adversary to date\\" as they were instructed to use it in as many ways as possible. The musical score for Mega Man X2 was chiefly composed by Yuki Iwai. Others, such as Ippo Yamada, were involved in some of the game's sound production. Tsuge wanted the Flame Stag stage theme cut from the game, but the song was kept due to its popularity among the development staff. Additionally, the game's ending theme was originally its final boss track. As the team felt it was more appropriate for the ending music, it was slightly altered and made as such. The Mega Man X2 soundtrack, featuring the original SNES instrumentals, was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 compilation released by Suleputer in 2003.  Release  The game was released in Japan on December 16, 1994 and in North America and PAL regions in 1995. Mega Man X2 was included in the Mega Man X Collection for the Nintendo GameCube and PlayStation 2 (PS2) in North America in 2006. The game was also released on Japanese mobile phones in 2008 and 2009 and worldwide on the Virtual Console in 2011 and 2012 for the Wii and in 2013/2014 for the Wii U. In 2006, Mega Man X2 was included as part of the North American Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube and PS2. A version for i-mode and EZweb-compatible mobile phones was made available in Japan between 2008 and 2009. Mega Man X2 was released on the Wii Virtual Console service in Japan on December 27, 2011, in PAL regions on May 31, 2012, and in North America on June 14, 2012. It was ported for the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch as part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection (Rockman X Anniversary Collection in Japan) which was released on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan.Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2 launch July 24th -Capcom Unity Reception Reception for Mega Man X2 has been primarily positive by virtue of its graphics, sound, and a persistently enjoyable gameplay model which critics and fans of the Mega Man series had come to expect. Comparing the game to the first Mega Man X, GamePros Chris Nicolella called Mega Man X2 \\"improved in almost every way\\". Nicolella summarized, \\"The new C4 chip energizes the already great graphics, the extremely responsive controls are perfect and the levels contain more enemies and hidden locations than any MM cart yet.\\" Dave Halverson of GameFan likewise enjoyed the level designs and judged the new armor abilities and the music to be better than the original Mega Man X. GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer were appreciative of Capcom's attempt at expanding Mega Man X2 over its predecessor in all aspects, especially the story, which they called \\"involving ... with engaging characters\\". Next Generation reviewed the SNES version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is one series in need of a serious overhaul. And despite it all, the little blue guy is just as unbearably fun as he always was.\\" The game has made it to several lists of best games for the Super Nintendo console. IGN named Mega Man X2 as the 31st-best game in its list of the top 100 SNES games of all time. \\"Following up the explosive debut of the Mega Man X series was no small task,\\" the website abstracted, \\"but Mega Man X2 accomplished the job admirably.\\" References External links *Official Rockman website Category:1994 video games Category:Mega Man X games Category:Mobile games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Virtual Console games Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U Category:Video games set in the 22nd century Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Superhero video games Category:Arctic in fiction Category:Malware in fiction ","title":"Mega Man X2"},{"id":"2152379","text":"Discone made of solid copper sheets, theoretically covering 700MHz to 2GHz. A discone antenna is a version of a biconical antenna in which one of the cones is replaced by a disc. It is usually mounted vertically, with the disc at the top and the cone beneath. Omnidirectional, vertically polarized and with gain similar to a dipole, it is exceptionally wideband, offering a frequency range ratio of up to approximately 10:1. The radiation pattern in the vertical plane is quite narrow, making its sensitivity highest in the direction of the horizon and rather less for signals coming from relatively close by. History On February 6, 1945, Armig G. Kandoian of New York City was awarded U.S. patent number 2,368,663 (assignor to Federal Telephone and Radio Corporation (later merged with ITT Corporation) for a \\"broad band antenna\\", from an application made on May 15, 1943. Excerpt from the Kandoian patent:Patent Application for a Discone Antenna by Armig G. Kodoian > In keeping with progress made during the last few years in the development > of ultra-high frequency radio technique, and applications thereof to > aircraft communication, direction finding, and so forth, it has become > necessary to develop special antennas and antenna systems suitable for > installation on such aircraft.

Description  Drawing of dimensions The discone antenna has a useful frequency range of at least 10 to 1. When employed as a transmitting antenna, it is often less efficient than an antenna designed for a more limited frequency range. SWR (standing wave ratio) is typically 1.5:1 or less over several octaves of frequency. A discone antenna consists of three main parts: the disc, the cone, and the insulator. * The disc: The disc should have an overall diameter of 0.7 times a quarter wavelength of the antenna's lowest frequency. The antenna's feed point is at the center of the disc. It is usually fed with 50-ohm coaxial cable, with the center conductor connected to the disc, and the outer conductor to the cone. * The cone: The length of the cone should be a quarter wavelength of the antenna's lowest operating frequency. The cone angle is generally from 25 to 40 degrees. * The insulator: The disc and cone must be separated by an insulator, the dimensions of which determine some of the antenna's properties, especially on near its high frequency limit.  Construction materials  A discone may be made from solid metal sheet (often copper), which is practical for small indoor UHF antennas, such as for Wi-Fi. At lower frequencies a sufficient number of metal wires or rods in a spoke configuration is often used to approximate a solid surface. This simplifies construction and reduces wind loading. Mounted discone antenna designed for VHF and UHF coverage. The spokes may be made of stiff wire, brazing rods or even coat hanger wire. The optimal number of rods comprising the disc and cone is often quoted as being from 8 to 16.  Applications  The discone's wideband coverage makes it attractive in commercial, military, amateur radio and radio scanner applications. The discone's inherently wideband nature permits it to broadcast undesirable spurious emissions from faulty or improperly filtered transmitters.  Extending low-frequency response  A vertical whip may be affixed to the center of the disc in order to extend the low frequency response, but this may compromise efficiency at higher frequencies. In this configuration, at lower frequencies the discone may more closely resemble a ground plane antenna or a coaxial dipole.

He shared first place at the Meralco-sponsored 1968 Philippine Open championship with world championship candidate Yugoslav grandmaster Svetozar Gligoriƒá. In 1975, then-IM Balinas achieved a 5-5 score at the Manila Marlboro Classic International Chess Tournament, one-half point short of the grandmaster norm, tying with Gligoric for 6th-7th place. Balinas defeated world championship candidates Lev Polugaevsky of USSR and Bent Larsen of Denmark, as well as the Czech-American grandmaster Lubomir Kavalek.  Winner at Odessa and grandmaster in 1976  Balinas achieved his greatest victory at the 1976 Odessa International Tournament, winning with a 10‚Äì4 score. Balinas was undefeated against all Soviet opponents, and a point ahead of Lev Alburt, and former Soviet champion Vladimir Savon. Bobby Ang, a Philippine chess columnist of Indo Chess and Philippine Business World, recounted in his Chess Piece column: \\"Vladimir Savon, the Absolute Russian Chess champion pre-tournament favorite, had been upset in the second round by Tseitlin and it was Balinas who jumped into the lead scoring 5/6. Savon gave chase and three rounds before the end of the tournament the two leaders met.

In the game, players manage a soccer team through a season and participate in matches played against the computer. As the team coach, users also must deal with the rise and fall of individual team member's skills during the season. Players can play with actual teams from the MLS or customize their own team from a pool of MLS players, and the game allows users to disable select rules such as offside. The game also offers a two-player mode on a single computer where one player uses the mouse to control their team and the other uses the keyboard.

It was established in 1913 as an elite regiment of Evzones, recruited in Central Greece and headquartered in Lamia. As such the unit served in the Macedonian front of World War I, the Allied intervention in the Ukraine, the Greco-Turkish War of 1919‚Äì1922, and the Greco-Italian War during World War II. Reformed as the 53rd Brigade (53Œ∑ Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±) in 1948, it participated in the Greek Civil War, before receiving the designation 5/42 Infantry Regiment (5/42 Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± Œ†ŒµŒ∂ŒπŒ∫Œøœç, 5/42 Œ£Œ†) in 1951. The regiment was disbanded in 1954, but revived as a reserve formation in 1979, under its original name. In November 2000 it received the honorific title \\"Delvinaki\\". Since January 2003 it is a battalion-sized formation that forms the garrison of the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos. History =Establishment and World War I= The regiment was established, along with the other four Evzone regiments of the Hellenic Army, by Royal Decree on 23 December 1913. Its base was at Lamia, and it came under the command of 13th Infantry Division in Chalkis. The first years of its history are relatively obscure, largely because the relevant archives were destroyed both in the aftermath of the National Schism of 1916 and during the Axis occupation of Greece in World War II. The regiment certainly participated in the mobilization of 10 September 1915, and remained in wartime strength until the demobilization, forced on Greece (then still neutral) by the Allied Powers, on 26 May 1916. As part of the Allied demands, most of the Greek army was evacuated to the Peloponnese; doubtlessly the 5/42 Regiment was part of this. Following Greece's entry into World War I on the side of the Allies in June 1917, the Greek army began to be re-formed. The 5/42 Regiment began its mobilization on 16 January 1918, and after reaching its full strength moved by ship to Thessaloniki, where it completed its training by the end of May 1918. As part of 13th Division, in June the regiment was moved to the Macedonian front along the Strymon River, occupying positions between the Achinos Lake and the village of Agia Eleni. During September, the regiment conducted a reconnaissance in force mission to ascertain enemy strength in its sector, in preparation for the great Allied offensive of that month. In October, as the rest of 13th Division was withdrawn to participate in the northward advance of I Army Corps, the regiment took over the entire front sector of the division. On 16 September, Bulgaria signed the Armistice of Salonica, obliging it to evacuate all Greek and Serbian territory it occupied. As a result, on 3 October the 5/42 Regiment was ordered to reoccupy the port city of Kavala. The Bulgarian garrison initially refused to comply with the armistice terms, but after the regiment took battle positions outside the city, the Bulgarians agreed to withdraw. =Plastiras takes command and the Ukraine expedition= Despite its participation in the front, the regiment was regarded as highly problematic: most of its recruits and officers, including its commander, Colonel Kontos, were loyal to King Constantine I, who had been ousted by the Allies in June 1917, allowing Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos to bring Greece into the war. Dissatisfaction was so rife that in August 1918 the regiment was the centre of a conspiracy, which included the other units of the 13th Division as well, to defect to the Bulgarians. The conspiracy was thwarted at the last moment due to happen-stance. The unit was furthermore plagued by indiscipline, with soldiers and even officers plundering the local peasants, particularly Turks. It was at that point that command was assumed by Lt. Colonel Nikolaos Plastiras, who had until then commanded the 6th Regiment of the Archipelago Division, part of the staunchly Venizelist Army of National Defence. As such, his first contact with his men was marked by barely disguised hostility, with soldiers muttering that they would should him as soon as they got into combat. The regiment was slated to be part of the Greek expeditionary force in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and Plastiras tried to raise morale by pointing out that the expedition was in support of Greek territorial claims on Smyrna and Asia Minor. Plastiras soon managed to instil discipline, reform and re-equip the unit, which under his command distinguished itself over the following three years of campaigning. Men of the regiment with Captain Christodoulou, Odessa, 1919 The regiment remained at Kavala until February 1919. On 28 February, it embarked at Eleftheres for the Ukraine, on board the passenger liners Imperator Nikolai and Patris. The regiment disembarked at Odessa on 4 March. Ten days later it was sent to reinforce the northeastern sector of the Allied front at Serbka. In the evening of 16 March it relieved the 3rd Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting against superior Bolshevik forces for ten days without interruption. Plastiras took over command of two other Greek battalions from the 3rd and 34th regiments, as well as local French cavalry, engineers, and artillery units, and formed a tactical detachment, which gave the regiment the name under which it became famous: \\"Plastiras Detachment\\" (ŒëœÄœåœÉœÄŒ±œÉŒºŒ± Œ†ŒªŒ±œÉœÑŒÆœÅŒ±). On 17 March the detachment repelled Bolshevik attacks and, launching a counterattack, pursued them beyond their original starting lines. Renewed offensives on the 18th were also repulsed, but the withdrawal of French units elsewhere along the front forced the 5/42 Regiment to likewise withdraw. The following five days (19‚Äì23 March) were spent in a continuous fighting retreat, until the Allied high command negotiated their safe withdrawal to Bessarabia. On 29 March, the 5/42 Regiment crossed the Dniester River to Romanian territory. Along with the other Allied forces, the 5/42 Regiment occupied defensive positions along the Dniester to prevent the Bolsheviks from crossing it until 17 May, when it was relieved by Romanian troops. As with the rest of 13th Division, it gradually withdrew through Romania over the next month, until embarking for Smyrna from Gala»õi on 15 June. The regiment's experience in Ukraine, albeit brief, resulted in an innovation that characterized it under Plastiras' command: due to their contact with the Russians, especially the Cossacks, the Evzones had acquired horses, and Plastiras formed a small mounted detachment of Evzones. Gradually, the unit was expanded over the next few years with captured horses. In Asia Minor, it provided valuable reconnaissance services, making contact and dismounting to fight while the rest of the regiment caught up; its infantrymen even held their own in clashes against the formidable Turkish cavalry. =Asia Minor Campaign= Arrival and first operations, 1919 The 5/42 Evzone Regiment arrived at Smyrna on 19 June. From there the regiment marched to the front, relieving the 5th Archipelago Regiment near Manisa on 28 June. The regiment had its first clash with the Turkish nationalists on 8 July, when it repelled attack by Turkish irregulars against the village of Papazli, killing 5 and taking 25 enemy prisoners. Another attack by an 800-strong force on 29 July was also repulsed, with 90 casualties among the attackers. The regiment retained and strengthened its positions around Manisa for the next three months. In November, however, the Supreme Allied Council allowed the Greek army to advance beyond the original limits of the Greek zone of occupation, and the 5/42 Regiment occupied new forward positions on 19‚Äì22 November. The regiment participated with one company in a local attack by the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment on 8 January 1920, but otherwise the period until the beginning of the Greek summer offensive in June 1920 was relatively tranquil. 1920 summer offensive Plastiras with mounted Evzones during the Asia Minor Campaign During the 1920 summer offensive, the regiment captured Akhisar (Axari), followed by Gelembe (12 June), Balƒ±kesir (16 June), and √ñmerk√∂y (19 June), where it linked up with the Mixed Brigade of the Xanthi Division, that had landed at Bandƒ±rma on the same day. From 23 June to 23 August it occupied defensive positions in the Susurluk‚ÄìKepsut area. On 24 August it began moving south to Elvadar in the area of Ala≈üehir, and from there, on 10 October, to U≈üak. On 15 October the regiment took over the salient at Gediz, and three days later advanced further to take over the front subsector of Dosecƒ±k. A Turkish attack on the Gediz sector was repelled, and the Greek forces were able to occupy strong defensive positions. As contact with the retreating Turkish forces was lost, on 3 November two companies of the 5/42 Regiment carried out a reconnaissance in force in a depth of 7‚Äì10 kilometres, engaging and destroying two enemy groups of 100 men each. From 6 November 1920 until March 1921, the regiment occupied defensive positions in the Selvioƒülu‚ÄîKada area west of U≈üak. During that time, in Greece, a decisive political change occurred, when Venizelos was defeated and the royalist opposition took power in the November 1920 elections. In its aftermath, most of the commanders in the Asia Minor front, who were mostly Venizelist, were replaced by royalist appointees. Although most of the men of the 5/42 Regiment were themselves royalist and anti-Venizelist, by this time their esprit de corps and identification with Plastiras was so strong, that the latter was retained in command of the regiment by the new government. 1921 spring offensive The regiment participated in the spring offensive of 1921, that ended with the Second Battle of ƒ∞n√∂n√º. It began its advance on 10 March, at the head of the 13th Division's column, occupied the passes between Tokutepe and Tezler Karlƒ±k on the 11th, descended the northern slopes of Akar Daƒü despite the heavy snow which in many places reached the height of a man (1.7 m), and occupied the line G√ºney Tezler on the 12th. On the 13th, the regiment reached the Cakirsaz‚ÄìYaƒücƒ±lar heights, where it came into contact with the main Turkish forces. On 6:00 on the next day, the regiment launched a frontal attack with its 1st and 2nd Battalions, while the 3rd Battalion launched a flanking manoeuvre to the enemy left. The threat of encirclement forced the Turks to withdraw, allowing the regiment to capture the Cakirsaz heights and enter the city of Afyonkarahisar on the same day. Over the next five days, the regiment advanced east some 15 kilometres, and captured the town of √áay on the 20th. However, despite the successes achieved in the southern sector of the front, assigned to I Army Corps, in the north the III Army Corps failed to achieve its objectives. As a result, the Army of Asia Minor broke off the offensive and ordered the I Army Corps to withdraw from its gains to the area of Dumlupƒ±nar. The 5/42 Regiment withdrew to Balmahmut, and thence to positions south of Dumlupƒ±nar on 26 March. On 28‚Äì29 March the regiment participated in the repulsion of the Turkish attack on the new Greek positions, by a manoeuvre towards Ali Veran, where it succeeded in dispersing significant Turkish infantry and cavalry forces. Advance to Ankara and retreat, summer 1921 Soldiers of the 5/42 Regiment in Asia Minor, 1921 From 1 April it was stationed at Elma Daƒü, and then at Derbent, where it assembled as part of the preparations for a summer offensive. The second Greek summer offensive began on 24 June 1920. On 24‚Äì25 June, the 5/42 Regiment advanced to its starting positions at Alaba. It began its attack on 29, and within the day advanced to new positions north and northeast of the town of Altƒ±nta≈ü. On 2‚Äì3 July the regiment's advance was halted due to strong Turkish resistance, but the advance of II Army Corps forced the Turks to withdraw, and the regiment continued its advance towards Seyitgazi, reaching the heights southeast of the town on 7 July. On 8 July it captured the D√ºztepe heights by storm, and repulsed strong Turkish counterattacks during the night. The regiment remained at D√ºztepe as a covering force until 31 July, occupying the right flank o 13th Division. When the Greek high command decided to continue operations towards Ankara, the 5/42 Regiment advanced east through the northern reaches of the salt desert around Lake Tuz; the march lasted from 1‚Äì10 August. With the start of the Battle of Sakarya, on the 12th the regiment attacked the flank of the Turkish 1st Group of Divisions, in the direction of Bakal Daƒü. On the next day, it attacked the heights of Karatepe and captured the western portion of the Kaltakli plateau. On 14‚Äì15 August, the regiment captured the area south of the Karasuleymanlƒ± village. On the night of 24 August, it repulsed a night attack by the Turkish forces, and another strong attack on the next day. On 28‚Äì29 the regiment was moved to the left flank of the Army of Asia Minor, and crossed the Sakarya River on the 30th, occupying new defensive positions north of √áandakoƒülu Dere, covering the right flank of 13th Division. Following the Greek retreat from Sakarya, the regiment continued covering the right of 13th Division, but sent its 2nd Battalion to reinforce the 12th Infantry Division on 2 September. On 27 September, the regiment occupied defensive positions between the heights north of Hayren Baba to the ravine of Ayaz In. There it remained until March 1922, when it handed over the Ayaz In subsector to the 5th Infantry Division. One battalion established a fortified centre at Ruklu Daƒü, while the remainder of the regiment was kept in the reserve. On 29 March, the Ruklu Daƒü section was handed over to 3rd Infantry Regiment, and the regiment was wholly placed in reserve of the I Army Corps. On 13 June it was moved to √áakƒ±rsaz, with one battalion at Afyonkarahisar. Collapse and retreat to the coast, August 1922 Photo of Col. Nikolaos Plastiras, On 26 August 1922, the Turkish army launched a major and decisive offensive. The regiment was ordered forward to cover 4th Infantry Division's right flank, and plug the gap between it and the neighbouring 1st Infantry Division, at the Kalecik subsector. On the same evening, the regiment's 3rd company recaptured the strongpoint of Katsimpali, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions established advance guards at the Kalecik subsector; the 3rd Battalion arrived at the area at dawn of the 14th, after marching through the night. The regiment spent the entire day repulsing Turkish attacks supported by heavy artillery fire. The regiment launched counterattacks, but the 1st and 3rd Battalions suffered heavy losses, forcing them to withdraw, covered by 2nd Battalion. With great difficulty, and after suffering over 600 killed, the regiment managed to occupy new positions on the Beltepe heights; at 18:30, it received the order to withdraw. The withdrawal was carried out during the night: passing south of the K√∂pr√ºl√º heights, held by the 23rd Infantry Regiment, the Evzones arrived at the train line some 3 km west of the Balmahmut rail station, where they stopped. On the next day, the regiment continued its retreat towards the Dumlupƒ±nar heights, and established new defensive positions at Hasan Dede Tepe in the evening. On the 16th, it repulsed an attack by a Turkish regimental-sized force. During the next day, the V and XIII cavalry demi-companies and the regiment's own mounted detachment arrived, having passed through the Turkish lines. Due to the advance of the Turks on both of its flanks, and in order to avoid being cut off, Plastiras again decided to withdraw, with the 3rd Battalion covering the rear. On the 18th, marching through mountainous and wooded terrain, the retreating Evzones were attacked by another regimental-sized Turkish force, but repelled it, and reached the foothills of Elma Daƒü around midnight. The 5/42 Regiment managed to re-establish contact with the other Greek forces, specifically the remnants of the 1st Division, at 11:00 on 19 August. Along with what remained of 1st Division's 2nd and 3rd Infantry Regiments, the 5/42 Regiment continued its retreat until reaching Takmak on the evening of 20 August. By the next day, the 5/42 Evzone Regiment remained as the only cohesive and battle-worthy formation in the entire II Army Corps area. On the initiative of Plastiras, the regiment did not follow the remaining forces of the Corps, but remained as a rear guard, originally placed in reserve to 7th Infantry Division northeast of Kirank√∂y. Later that same day, it was ordered to occupy the Beskaya Daƒü heights to cover 7th Division's left flank. A Turkish column moving to occupy Ak Ta≈ü made contact with the regiment's new positions, and was torn apart by concentrated infantry and artillery fire. During the night, the withdrawal resumed, with the Evzones as 7th Division's rear guard. On the evening of the next day, it arrived at the village of Paklacƒ±k, and thence to the rail station of Ala≈üehir, where it embarked on trains, arriving at Salihli around midnight. At daybreak on the 23rd, it became clear that Salihli was surrounded by strong Turkish infantry and cavalry forces, but after a three-hour battle, together with elements of the Cavalry Division, the Evzones managed to force the Turkish forces to disperse and withdraw. The regiment remained at Salihli until 05:00 of 24 August, when it rejoined 13th Division, marching towards Kasaba (modern Turgutlu), where it arrived on 02:00 of 25 August. Later on the same day the regiment was ordered to occupy positions on the southeastern slopes of Mount Nif, but on its way there it was recalled and ordered instead to make for Burnaba≈üi, where it arrived on 21:00. There it remained during the next day, setting off at 01:00 of 27 August for Kozaƒüa√ß, where it arrived on 07:00. The regiment guarded the flanks of the Southern Group, allowing its main column to escape to safety; a small Turkish irregular force attacked but was repulsed. The regiment set off again on 14:00 for Ak√ßekaya, where it arrived six hours later. From the morning of 28 August, the 5/42 Regiment covered the retreat of the remaining Greek forces through the √áe≈üme peninsula to the coast, marching through G√ºlbah√ße, G√ºneli, and Lestren Daƒü, where it arrived at noon on the 29th. It remained there until midnight on 31 August, when it moved towards Ala√ßatƒ±, occupying positions west of Zeytineli in order to cover the embarkation of the other units. Finally, on 2 September, the regiment moved to √áe≈üme, where it embarked on ships for Chios. During the war, the regiment enjoyed a formidable reputation among the Turks: the regiment was known as ≈ûeytan asker (\\"Satan's army\\"), and Plastiras as Karapiper (\\"black pepper\\"). September 1922 Revolution and demobilization The military units that escaped the disaster in Asia Minor launched the anti-royalist 11 September 1922 Revolution, headed by Plastiras, Colonel Stylianos Gonatas as representative of the army units in Lesbos and Commander Dimitrios Fokas as representative of the Navy. The 5/42 Regiment embarked at Chios on the same day, and arrived at Lavrion on the evening of 15 September, along with other army units. Following the renewed resignation of King Constantine I, the revolutionary army units disembarked at Piraeus and Faliron. The new revolutionary government ordered the demobilization of I Army Corps, and the dismissal of the oldest reserve classes. As a result, the 5/42 Regiment demobilized and returned to its peacetime garrison at Lamia. =Interwar period= The 5/42 Regiment remained at its garrison in Lamia throughout the interwar period, which in Greece saw the establishment short-lived and troubled Second Hellenic Republic (1924‚Äì1935). Its history during this period is obscure, but it does not appear to have taken part in the frequent coups and counter-coups of the period, until the Venizelist coup attempt of 1 March 1935 against the conservative and pro-royalist government. As part of the coup, which was led by none other than Plastiras, IV Army Corps in eastern Macedonia mutinied. General Georgios Kondylis, the Minister for Military Affairs, mobilized forces against the rebels, including a thousand-strong detachment from the 5/42 Regiment under its deputy commander, Panagiotis Raftodimos. The detachment arrived by rail at the village of Kalokastro, near the Strymon River, on 3 March, and bivouacked in a ravine. It took part in the forced crossing of the river on 10 March, and arrived near Serres by afternoon. Following this attack, the rebel leadership gave up and fled to Bulgaria on 11 March, signalling the collapse of the coup. The Evzones then returned to Lamia by rail. On 4 September 1935, as part of a reorganization of the Army, the regiment received the new designation 42nd Evzone Regiment (42Œø Œ£œçŒΩœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± ŒïœÖŒ∂œéŒΩœâŒΩ, 42 Œ£Œï). On 28 November 1935, the late Queen Sophia, the mother of the reigning King George II, was declared the regiment's honorary colonel-in-chief. Its men thereafter wore the royal cypher, a capital sigma topped by a crown (golden for staff officers, silver for junior officers, red for NCOs and other ranks), on their epaulettes. =Greco-Italian War= Mobilization and march to the Albanian border The probability of an Italian attack increased over the summer of 1940 after a series of provocations culminating in the sinking of the cruiser Elli by an Italian submarine on 15 August. As a result, on 27 August ‚Äì 2 September the regiment began secret mobilization through individual call-up papers, which from 29 August was complemented by a full, public mobilization. The regimental commander at this time was Colonel Ippokratis Papadimitropoulos. He remained in command until 4 December 1940, when he was replaced by Col. Georgios Papageorgiou. Col. Papageorgiou led the regiment until 6 March 1941. The identity of his replacement is unknown. On 3 September, the regiment began moving towards the border with Albania (under Italian control since 1939). Battalion by battalion was moved by train to Kalambaka, and thence marched through Metsovo and Ioannina to Delvinaki. The move was completed on 8 September. The regiment came under the command of the local 8th Infantry Division, with the following disposition: 1st Battalion at Zitsa, 2nd Battalion plus an artillery section as a covering force in the Ktismata‚ÄìDelvinaki area, and 3rd Battalion in the Sitaria‚ÄìParakalamos area. Repulsion of the Italian offensive Along with the neighbouring 15th Infantry Regiment, the 42nd Regiment faced the Italian armoured division Centauro. The Italian invasion of Greece began on 28 October with an artillery bombardment followed by an infantry attack against the regiment's covering elements. As a result, the 2nd Battalion withdrew to the south of Delvinaki, and on the next day regrouped at Mazaraki. On the same day, the regiment established its three battalions in defensive positions along the line Chavos Height‚ÄìMakrynoros‚ÄìSossinou Monastery‚ÄìRepetista. From 30 October to 4 November, the regiment withstood enemy bombardment and repulsed minor Italian attacks, while strengthening its positions. On the night of 4/5 November, the regiment was ordered to retreat to a line between Agios Ilias height and Vrontismeni. 1st and 3rd Battalion, along with the 2nd Machine-Gun Battalion, were deployed on the line, while 2nd Battalion was kept in reserve. The new line was kept under bombardment for two consecutive days, but on the night of 10/11 November, the regiment carried out a reconnaissance in force towards the Siastis height that resulted in the capture of 90 prisoners. Counterattack into Albania Evzones on the Albanian front, winter of 1940/41 On 13 November, as part of the general Greek counter-offensive, the 42nd Regiment advanced towards the direction of Kouklioi and Sossinou Monastery. On 14‚Äì17 November the regiment advanced up to the heights north of Kouklioi and Grimbiani, and recaptured the villages of Repetista, Sitaria, and Kryoneri. On the evening of the 17th, the regiment was reinforced with the 3rd Battalion/36th Infantry Regiment. On 18‚Äì20 November, the Evzones took the Profitis Ilias and Rouitsa heights by storm, capturing 350 prisoners, 45 mules and 4 machine guns, along with relevant materiel. On 20 November the regiment retook control of the Delvinaki pass and 2nd Battalion moved north into Pogoni. During the next five days the regiment advanced in a three-pronged attack to Ktismata, Zavrocho, and the heights above Teriachi. The regiment continued its advance with multiple offensive actions, and captured the heights east of the villages of Argyrochori, Chrysodouli, and Agios Nikolaos by 30 November. It failed, however, to capture Height 669. The height was finally captured on 5 December after successive attacks. From 6 December the regiment was withdrawn from the front line and moved north to the Ano Episkopi‚ÄìKato Episkopi area for rest, except for 1st Battalion, which was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division, and the 2nd Battalion, which was assigned to I Army Corps. On 9 December the 3rd Battalion/36th Regiment rejoined its parent unit. On 29‚Äì31 December the regiment marched from Episkopi through Lazarat, Gjirokast√´r, and √áepun√´ to Kolonj√´. There it went into quarters, and took over command of the 1st Battalion/40th Evzone Regiment as well. On 1‚Äì2 January 1941, the 3rd Battalion was moved to the front sector held by the 11th Infantry Regiment in the Mali Shpat heights south of Tepelen√´. There it launched an attack on 3 January, but it failed with heavy casualties. On 4‚Äì5 January, 1st Battalion too was moved to the Mali Shpat sector, replacing elements of the 8th Infantry Regiment. The regiment took over the sector held by 11th Regimemt, which was moved to the rear. The regiment held its positions until 26 January. The heavy winter weather reduced activity on both sides apart from an attack launched on 16 January by 1st Battalion, which failed due to the strong Italian defences. On 27 January, the regiment was replaced at the front by the 85th Infantry Regiment and withdrawn to the rear in the Kolonj√´‚ÄìGolem area for rest and recuperation. In early February, 2nd Battalion was released from I Army Corps and rejoined the regiment. Retreat and disbandment On 12 March, the regiment, reinforced with 1st Battalion/40th Regiment, again took over the front sector of northern Mali Shpat, replacing the 85th Regiment. On 24 March, the regiment's 1st Battalion returned from its assignment to 3rd Division, allowing the 1st Battalion/40th Regiment to return to its parent unit. During this period, the Italian forces launched a number of attacks on the regiment's lines, but were repulsed. On 13‚Äì15 April, however, with heavy artillery support, the Italians managed to break through the 9th Company (3rd Battalion). The regiment launched a counterattack, but the Greek artillery was unable to offer support due to lack of shells, and the operation failed. The front was finally plugged by reinforcements from the 34th Infantry Regiment. Following the start of the German invasion of Greece on 6 April and the rapid progress of the German troops with the capture of Thessaloniki three days later, on 12 April the Greek high command in Athens gave the order of retreat to the Greek forces on the Albanian front. On 16 April, the regiment began its withdrawal on the orders of 8th Division, from Mali Shpat to Kolonj√´, Kardhiq, and √áepun√´, and established new positions on the heights north of the Gjirokast√´r barracks on the 16th. The regiment repelled new enemy attacks on 18 April, but on the same night was ordered to withdraw. The regiment retreated from Gjirokast√´r, to the area of Bularat and Vodhin√´, establishing new positions north and west of Vodhin√´. Elsewhere the German advance, the lack of motor transport, and the sheer physical exhaustion of the Greek forces meant that the ordered retreat descended into chaos; over the next days, commanders reported signs of disintegration among some Greek units. As a result, on 20 April Lt. General Georgios Tsolakoglou made contact with the German army (the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade) and signed a protocol of surrender of the Greek army in Epirus. The 42nd Regiment maintained its position, repelling an Italian attack on 20 April, but on the same evening, it received news of the armistice. Despite the armistice, the Italians attacked on the next day, but were repulsed. On 22 April the regiment recommenced its southward retreat to Krioner. On the 23rd it crossed the pre-war border, moving through Kouklioi and Mazaraki to Zitsa. On 24 April it moved to the village of Grammeno and then the village of Dramesioi. The regiment remained there on 25‚Äì26 April, gathering its weapons and materiel and, following orders by 8th Division, storing it in the village school. The keys were deposited in the local Gendarmerie station. On 27 April, the regiment began moving south, and arrived in the area of Filippiada on the 30th. There those soldiers who desired to, were released to return home as best they could. The remainder of the regiment moved to Arta and Amfilochia. On 3 May, the regiment was allowed to disband; over the next three days its men returned to Lamia via Karpenisi and Lianokladi. =Axis occupation and resistance= During the subsequent Axis occupation of Greece, in April 1943 Colonel Dimitrios Psarros re-founded the 5/42 Evzone Regiment as the armed wing of the National and Social Liberation (EKKA) resistance group. The unit remained active until forcibly dissolved by the rival Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) in April 1944. Psarros was killed while in ELAS custody. =Greek Civil War and postwar period= In April 1948, the 53rd Brigade (53Œ∑ Œ§Œ±ŒæŒπŒ±œÅœáŒØŒ±) was formed at Larissa, with the 593rd, 601st, and 603rd Infantry Battalions, as part of II Army Corps. In summer 1948, it fought in the Battle of Grammos‚ÄìVitsi. From September 1948 it became an integral part of the 1st Infantry Division. As such it was assigned to I Army Corps in 1949 and participated in the decisive Operation Pyrsos, that expelled the communist forces from their strongholds on Grammos and Vitsi and ended the civil war in a government victory. On 30 April 1951, the 53rd Brigade was renamed into 5/42 Infantry Regiment, based at Kolokouri near Katerini, under the command of the 1st Infantry Division. The regiment remained active until disbanded on 26 June 1954. The unit was reactivated as a reserve formation on 1 January 1979 at Veroia in replacement of the 81st Infantry Regiment, and moved to Skydra in December. In November 2000 it received the honorific title \\"Delvinaki\\". Since January 2003 it forms the garrison of the Dodecanese island of Kalymnos. It is a battalion-sized formation under the 80th National Guard Higher Command.

Professional baseball leagues hire official scorers to keep an official record of each game (from which a box score can be generated), but many fans keep score as well for their own enjoyment. Scorekeeping is usually done on a printed scorecard and, while official scorers must adhere precisely to one of the few different scorekeeping notations, most fans exercise some amount of creativity and adopt their own symbols and styles. History Sportswriter Henry Chadwick is generally credited as the inventor of baseball scorekeeping. His basic scorecard and notation have evolved significantly since their advent in the 1870sDickson, Paul. The Joy of Keeping Score. New York: Walker. . but they remain the basis for most of what has followed. Abbreviations and grammar Some symbols and abbreviations are shared by nearly all scorekeeping systems. For example, the position of each player is indicated by a number: # Pitcher (P) # Catcher (C) # First baseman (1B) # Second baseman (2B) # Third baseman (3B) # Shortstop (SS) # Left fielder (LF) # Center fielder (CF) # Right fielder (RF) # Rover or short fielder (used primarily in softball) The designated hitter (DH), if used, is marked using a zero (0). Scorecards Scorecards vary in appearance but almost all share some basic features, including areas for: * Recording general game information (date and time, location, teams, etc.) * Listing the batting lineup (with player positions and uniform numbers) * Recording the play-by-play action (usually the majority of the scorecard) * Tallying each player's total at-bats, hits, runs, etc. at the end of the game * Listing the pitchers in the game, including their statistics, such as innings pitched, strikeouts, earned runs, and bases on balls Usually two scorecards (one for each team) are used to score a game. Traditional scorekeeping perfect game, by Lee Richmond, 1880. Abbreviations: A, B, C, for first, second and third, P and H for pitcher and catcher, S for shortstop, L, M, and R for left, center, and right field There is no authoritative set of rules for scorekeeping. The traditional method has many variations in its symbols and syntax, but this is a typical example. In the traditional method, each cell in the main area of the scoresheet represents the \\"lifetime\\" of an offensive player, from at-bat, to baserunner, to being put out, scoring a run, or being left on base. =Outs= When an out is recorded, the combination of defensive players executing that out is recorded. For example: * If a batter hits a ball on the ground to the shortstop, who throws the ball to the first baseman to force the first out, it would be noted on the scoresheet as 6‚Äì3, with 6 for the shortstop and 3 for the first baseman. * If the next batter hits a ball to the center fielder who catches it on the fly for the second out, it would be noted as F8, with F for flyout and 8 for the center fielder. (In some systems, the letter 'F' is reserved for foul outs. A fly out would therefore be scored simply as '8'.) Other systems append a lower-case \\"∆í\\" for foul balls, as in F9∆í A vertically reflected K is the standard notation for a strikeout looking. * If the following batter strikes out, it would be noted as K, with the K being the standard notation for a strikeout. If the batter did not swing at the third strike, a \\"backwards K\\" (K, see right) is traditionally used. Other forms include \\"Kc\\" for a called third strike with no swing, or \\"Ks\\" if the batter did swing. A slash should be drawn across the lower right corner to indicate the end of the inning. * If a runner is put out while on base, the next basepath is filled-in halfway, then ended with a short stroke perpendicular to the basepath. A notation is then added to indicate how the runner was out, along with the defensive combination that resulted in the out: ** CS means the runner was caught trying to steal the base ahead. The notation for a runner caught trying to steal second is normally 2‚Äì4 or 2‚Äì6 for a catcher-to-second-base play. ** PO means the runner was picked off by the pitcher while he was off the base. This almost always occurs at first base, so the notation is usually 1‚Äì3. ** DP or TP means the runner was out as part of a double or triple play. Usually, the full notation is left on the batter's line (the last out of the play); 6‚Äì4‚Äì3, 4‚Äì6‚Äì3, and 5‚Äì4‚Äì3 are common double-play sequences. ** FC means the out was the result of a fielder's choice to get out the runner on base rather than force out the batter. This can also be indicative of an unsuccessful attempt at a double or triple play as such a move is often the first move to make such a play. =Reaching base= If a batter reaches first base, either due to a walk, a hit, or an error, the basepath from home to first base is drawn, and the method described in the lower-righthand corner. For example: * If a batter gets a base hit, the basepath is drawn and 1B or ‚Äì (for a single-base hit) is written below. * If the batter hits a double, however, the basepaths from home to first and first to second are drawn, and 2B or = is written above. This change of position is done to indicate that the runner did not advance on another hit. If the batter hits a triple, the basepaths are drawn from home to first to second to third and 3B or ‚â° is written in the upper lefthand corner for the same reason. * If a batter gets a walk, the basepath is drawn and BB (for Base on Balls) or W (for Walk) is written below. IBB is written for an intentional base on balls. Other indicators may be used if the batter is awarded first base for other reasons (HBP for being hit by a pitch, CI for catcher's interference, etc.). * If the batter reaches first base due to fielder's choice (ex. the shortstop decides to force out the runner heading to second instead), the basepath is drawn and FC is written along with the sequence of the defense's handling of the ball, e.g., 6‚Äì4. * If the batter reaches base because the first baseman dropped the throw from the shortstop, the basepath is drawn and E3 (an error committed by the first baseman) is written below. * If a batter gets a base hit then in the same play advances due to a fielding error by the second baseman (ex. he misses the throw from the outfield, allowing the ball to get away), these are written as two events. First, the path to first is drawn with a 1B noted as for a single, then the path to second is drawn with an E4 noted above. This correctly describes the scoring‚Äîa single plus an error. =Advancing= When a runner advances due to a following batter, it can be noted by the batting position or the uniform number of the batter that advanced the runner. This kind of information is not always included by amateur scorers, and there is a lot of variation in notation. For example: * If a runner on first is advanced to third base due to action from the 4th batter, number 22, the paths from first to second to third are drawn in and either a 4 or 22 could be written in the upper left hand corner. Whether that action was a base hit or a sacrifice will be noted on the batter's annotation. * If a runner steals second while the 7th batter, number 32, is up to bat, the path from first to second would be drawn and SB followed by either a 7 or 32 could be written in the upper right hand corner. Note that Defensive Indifference (no attempt to throw out the runner) is denoted differently from a Stolen Base. * For a batter to be credited with advancing the runner, the base advance must be the result of the batter's action. If a runner advances beyond that due to an error (such as a bad catch) or a fielder's choice (such as a throw to tag out a runner ahead of him), the advance due to the batter's action and the advance due to the other action are noted separately. * To advance a player home to score a run, a runner must touch all 4 bases and cross all four base paths, therefore the scorer draws a complete diamond and, usually, fills it in. However, some scorers only fill in the diamond on a home run; they might then place a small dot in the center of the diamond to indicate a run scored but not a home run. The player that bats the runner home (or the other event such as an error that allows the runner to reach home) is noted in the lower left hand corner. =Miscellaneous= * End of an inning ‚Äì When the offensive team has made three outs, a slash is drawn diagonally across the lower right corner of the cell of the third out. After each half- inning, the total number of hits and runs can be noted at the bottom of the column. After the game, totals can be added up for each team and each batter. * Extra innings ‚Äì There are extra columns on a scoresheet that can be used if a game goes to extra innings, but if a game requires more columns, another scorecard will be needed for each team. * Substitutions ‚Äì When a substitution is made, a vertical line is drawn after the last at-bat for previous player, and the new player's name and number is written in the second line of the Player Information section. A notation of PH or PR should be made for pinch hit and pinch run situations. * Batting around ‚Äì After the ninth batter has batted, the record of the first batter should be noted in the same column. However, if more than nine batters bat in a single inning, the next column will be needed. Draw a diagonal line across the lower left hand corner, to indicate that the original column is being extended. =Example= Sample baseball scorecard from a game scored on August 8, 2000 at (then) Pacific Bell Park. The scorecard on the right describes the August 8, 2000 game between the Milwaukee Brewers and San Francisco Giants, played at Pacific Bell Park, in San Francisco. The scorecard describes the following events in the top of the 1st inning: * 1st Batter, #10 Ronnie Belliard (the Brewers' 2nd baseman) grounded the ball to the Giants' 3rd baseman (5), who fielded the ball and threw it to 1st base (3) for the out. The play is recorded as \\"5-3.\\" ** The notation (\\"3-2\\") in the lower right corner of the \\"Belliard:Inning 1 cell\\" indicates the pitch count at the time Belliard put the ball into play (3 balls and 2 strikes). * 2nd batter, #9 Marquis Grissom (the Brewers' center fielder) grounded out 5-3 (3rd baseman to 1st baseman) on a 2-ball, 2-strike count. * 3rd batter, #5 Geoff Jenkins (the Brewers' left fielder) grounded the ball to the 1st baseman (3) who took the ball to the base himself for an unassisted put out (3U). One hard and fast rule of baseball scorekeeping is that every out and every time a baserunner advances must be recorded. The scoring can get a little more complicated when a batter who has reached base, is then \\"moved up\\" (advances one or more bases) by his own actions or by the actions of a hitter behind him. This is demonstrated in the Giants' first inning: * 1st Batter, #7 Marvin Benard (the Giants' center fielder) hit a fly ball that was caught by the right fielder (9) for an out. Other scorekeepers might abbreviate this out using \\"F9\\" for fly out to right field. * 2nd batter, #32 Bill Mueller (the Giants' 3rd baseman) hit a single: he hit the ball into play and made it safely to first base. This is denoted by the single line running from \\"home\\" to \\"1st\\" next to the diamond in that cell. Commonly, scorekeepers will place some abbreviation, such as \\"1B-7\\", to designate a single hit to left field. In addition, many scorekeepers also place a line across the diamond to show the actual path of the baseball on the field. * 3rd batter, #25 Barry Bonds (the Giants' left fielder, incorrectly noted as a right fielder (\\"RF\\") on this scorecard) struck out (K) on a 1-ball, 2-strike count. At some point during Bonds' at-bat, Mueller, the runner on 1st base, stole 2nd base. This advancement was recorded in Mueller's cell by writing the notation \\"SB\\" next to the upper-right edge of the diamond. * 4th batter, #21 Jeff Kent (the Giants' 2nd baseman) hit a fly ball that was caught by the Brewers' right fielder (9) for the third and final out of the inning. Mueller was stranded on 2nd base. Stranded baserunners might be notated as being \\"LOB\\" (Left On Base) for that inning, with a number from 1-3 likely at the bottom of the inning column. For example, if two runners are left on base after the 3rd out, the scorekeeper might note \\"LOB:2\\", then at the end of the game calculate a total number of LOB for the game. A more complicated example of scorekeeping is the record of the bottom of the 5th inning: * 1st batter, #6 J. T. Snow (the Giants' 1st baseman and the fifth hitter in the Giants' lineup) advanced to first base on a walk (base-on-balls; BB). * 2nd batter, #23 Ellis Burks (the Giants' right fielder) grounded out 5-3 (3rd baseman to 1st baseman). In the process, Snow advanced to second base. * 3rd batter, #25 Rich Aurilia (the Giants' shortstop) flied out to the center fielder (8) for the second out of the inning. * 4th batter, #29 Bobby Estalella (the Giants' catcher) drew a walk (BB) to advance to first base. Snow remained at 2nd base. * 5th batter, #48 Russ Ortiz (the Giants' starting pitcher) hit a single (diagonal single line drawn next to the lower-right side of the diamond). Snow advanced to home plate on that single (the diagonal line drawn next to the lower left side of the diamond in Snow's \\"cell\\") to score the game's only run. Ortiz is given credit for an RBI (run batted in), denoted by the \\"R\\" written in the bottom left corner of his cell (incorrectly, since \\"R\\" indicates a 'run scored' and would more appropriately been noted in Snow's cell; \\"RBI\\" should have been written in Ortiz's cell). Estalella advanced from 1st to 3rd base on Ortiz's single (the diagonal line drawn next to the upper left side of the diamond in Estalella's \\"cell\\"). * 6th batter Marvin Bernard, up for the third time in this game, drew a walk (BB). Ortiz advanced to 2nd base on that walk (indicated by \\"BB\\" written on the \\"1st to 2nd\\" portion of the diamond in his cell. * 7th batter Bill Mueller hit a ground ball to the 3rd baseman (5), who then threw the ball to the 2nd baseman (4) to force out Bernard at 2nd base (6-4) for the third and final out of the inning. As a force out also could have been performed by throwing the ball to 1st base, this is scored as a fielder's choice (\\"FC\\"). Project Scoresheet Project Scoresheet was an organization run by volunteers in the 1980s for the purpose of collecting baseball game data and making it freely available to the public (the data collected by Major League Baseball was and still is not freely available). To collect and distribute the data, Project Scoresheet needed a method of keeping score that could be easily input to a computer. This limited the language to letters, numbers, and punctuation (no baseball diamonds or other symbols not found on a computer keyboard). =Scorecard= In addition to the new language introduced by Project Scoresheet, a few major changes were made to the traditional scorecard. First, innings of play are not recorded in a one-per- column fashion; instead all boxes are used sequentially and new innings are indicated with a heavy horizontal line. This saves considerable space on the card (since no boxes are left blank) and reduces the likelihood of a game requiring a second set of scorecards. The second major change is the detailed offensive and defensive in/out system, which allows the scorekeeper to specify very specifically when players enter and leave the game. This is vital for attributing events to the proper players. Lastly, each \\"event box\\" on a Project Scoresheet scorecard is broken down into three sections: before the play, during the play, and after the play. All events are put into one of these three slots. For example, a stolen base happens \\"before the play\\" because it occurs before the batter's at-bat is over. A hit is considered \\"during the play\\" because it ends the batter's plate appearance, and baserunner movement subsequent to the batter's activity is considered \\"after the play\\". =Language= The language developed by Project Scoresheet can be used to record trajectories and locations of batted balls and every defensive player who touched the ball, in addition to the basic information recorded by the traditional method. Here are some examples: In the \\"before the play\\" slot: * CS2(26): runner caught stealing 2B (catcher to shortstop) * 1-2/SB: runner on 1B steals 2B In \\"during the play\\" slot: * 53: ground-out to third baseman (\\"5-3\\" in the traditional system) * E5/TH1: error on the third baseman (on his throw to 1B) In the \\"after the play\\" slot: * 2-H: runner on 2B advances to home (scores) * 1XH(92): runner on 1B thrown out going home (right fielder to catcher) For a complete description of the language and the scorecard please see David Cortesi's documentation. Reisner Scorekeeping Project Scoresheet addressed a lack of precision in the traditional scorekeeping method, and introduced several new features to the scorecard. But while the Project Scoresheet language continues to be the baseball research community's standard for storing play-by-play game data in computers, the scorecards it yields are difficult to read due to the backtracking required to reconstruct a mid-inning play. Hence, despite its historical importance, the system has never gained favor with casual fans. In 2002 Alex Reisner developed a new scorekeeping method that took the language of Project Scoresheet but redefined the way the event boxes on the scorecard worked, virtually eliminating the backtracking required by both Project Scoresheet and the traditional method. The system also makes it easy to reconstruct any mid-inning situation, a difficult task with the other two systems (for this reason it was originally promoted as \\"Situational Scorekeeping\\"). =Scorecard= A Reisner scorecard looks like a cross between a traditional and Project Scoresheet scorecard. It has a diamond (representing the field, as in the traditional system) and a single line for recording action during and after the play (like Project Scoresheet's second and third lines). The diamond in each event box is used to show which bases are occupied by which players at the start of an at-bat. Stolen bases, pickoffs, and other \\"before the play\\" events are also marked on the diamond, so that one can see the \\"situation\\" in which an at-bat took place by simply glancing at the scorecard.

Background Developed in the early 1942 by Babcock & Wilcox to take advantage of coal grades not suitable for pulverized coal combustion, cyclone furnaces feed coal in a spiral manner into a combustion chamber for maximum combustion efficiency. A typical cyclone combustor During coal combustion in a furnace, volatile components burn without much difficulty. Fuel carbon ‚Äúchar‚Äù particles (heavier, less volatile coal constituents) require much higher temperatures and a continuing supply of oxygen. Cyclone furnaces are able to provide a thorough mixing of coal particles and air with sufficient turbulence to provide fresh air to surfaces of the coal particles. Cyclone furnaces were originally designed to take advantage of four things #Lower fuel preparation time and costs #Smaller more compact furnaces #Less fly ash and convective pass slagging #Flexibility in fuel types Operation A cyclone furnace consists of a horizontal cylindrical barrel attached through the side of a boiler furnace. The cyclone barrel is constructed with water cooled, tangential oriented, tube construction. Inside the cyclone barrel are short, densely spaced, pin studs welded to the outside of the tubes. The studs are coated with a refractory material, usually silica or aluminium based, that allows the cyclone to operate at a high enough temperature to keep the slag in a molten state and allow removal through the tap. Crushed coal and a small amount of primary air enter from the front of the cyclone into the burner. In the main cyclone burner, secondary air is introduced tangentially, causing a circulating gas flow pattern. The products, flue gas and un-combusted fuel, then leave the burner and pass over the boiler tubes. Tertiary air is then released further downstream to complete combustion of the remaining fuel, greatly reducing NOx formation. A layer of molten slag coats the burner and flows through traps at the bottom of the burners, reducing the amount of slag that would otherwise form on the boiler tubes. Cyclone Furnaces can handle a wide range of fuels. Low volatile bituminous coals, lignite coal, mineral rich anthracitic coal, wood chips, petroleum coke, and old tires can and have all been used in cyclones. The crushed coal is fed into the cyclone burner and fired with high rates of heat release. Before the hot gases enter in the boiler furnace the combustion of coal is completed. The crushed coal is fed into cyclone burners. The coal is Burned by centrifugal action which is imparted by the primary air which enters tangentially and secondary Air which also enters in the top tangentially at high speed and tertiary air is admitted in the centre. Due to Whirling action of coal and air, a large amount of heat is generated (1500-1600¬∞C) and that covered the surface of cyclone and ashes are transformed into molten slag. The molten slag drained from the boiler furnace through a slag tap.

It runs north from U.S. Route 101 in Ventura through the Transverse Ranges and the western side of the San Joaquin Valley to Interstate 5 at a point east of Tracy. SR 33 replaced part of U.S. Route 399 in 1964 during the \\"great renumbering\\" of routes. In the unincorporated sections of Kern County it is known as the West Side Highway. In addition, the California Legislature designated the entire Kern County portion as the Petroleum Highway in 2004. The southernmost portion in Ventura is a freeway known as the Ojai Freeway, while it is known as the Maricopa Highway from Ojai to Maricopa. Route description California State Route 33 begins in Ventura as a short freeway (\\"Ojai Freeway\\"). SR 33 then continues north as Maricopa Highway, an undivided surface road, through Ojai, following Matilija Canyon past the easternmost extremity of the Santa Ynez Mountains in Los Padres National Forest, and passing over the Transverse Ranges at Pine Mountain Summit. As SR 33 comes down into the Cuyama Valley, it comes up to a junction with SR 166 east of Cuyama. Route 33 continues with Route 166 as they enter Kern County for about to Maricopa where the routes separate. In Maricopa, Route 33 turns northwest, following the western side of the San Joaquin Valley. Between Taft and Avenal it roughly parallels Interstate 5 and the eastern foothills of the Temblor and Diablo ranges; for the first of the portion following the axis of the Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Northwest of Avenal, it turns due west to enter Coalinga, then turns northeast and soon becomes concurrent with I-5 for . Thereafter, it departs due north near Cantua Creek, turns northwest at Mendota, through Firebaugh and meets State Route 152 in Dos Palos, in which it runs concurrently due west for approximately ten miles. It departs again west of Los Banos, turning north to Santa Nella (where it has an interchange with I-5), and roughly parallels I-5 and the San Joaquin River until its northern terminus at I-5 and Bird Road southeast of Tracy. View northeast from near Pine Mountain Summit on SR 33, the highest elevation on the route. The Lockwood Valley and Mount Pinos are in the distance. When passing through the Avenal/Coalinga area travelers pass near a series of prisons and government facilities. They include: Avenal State Prison, Pleasant Valley State Prison, and the Coalinga State Hospital. SR 33 heading south through Kern County In the portions of the route in Kern and Fresno Counties, SR 33 passes through one of the United States' largest petroleum extraction fields, with hundreds of nodding oil pumps along the highway. Some of the fields visible from the highway include the Midway-Sunset, South and North Belridge, Cymric, McKittrick, Lost Hills, and Coalinga oil fields. Blackwells Corner Most of SR 33's route passes through sparsely populated, relatively desolate portions of the San Joaquin Valley. Travelers along it should use caution, since emergency services are typically dozens of miles away. Carrying extra water and coolant is especially advised, since summertime temperatures in the area routinely surpass . Several segments of this route are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but only a small portion near SR 152 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Several segments are eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only the portion from 6.4 miles north of the SR 150 junction to the Ventura‚ÄìSanta Barbara county line is a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. This scenic segment is also designated as part of the Jacinto Reyes Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway. History Before the US 399 designation was deleted in 1964, SR 33 followed SR 166 east from US 99 at Wheeler Ridge to Maricopa in lieu of the segment from Ventura to Maricopa, and followed the old US highway from Taft to Maricopa. Today, SR 166 remains on the segment between Wheeler Ridge and Maricopa. SR 33 used to extend north to Interstate 205 in Tracy, but this segment was relinquished after the segment of Interstate 5 from SR 33 to I-205 was completed.

Examples { style=\\"float:right;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"   } After the following common sequence of moves: :1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nxe4 5. Bxf7+?! (first diagram) White sees that if he recaptures with 5.Nxe4, Black responds with 5...d5, forking knight and bishop and winning back the piece. In that case, Black has not won material, but has destroyed White's center. Instead of allowing d5, White hopes to cause trouble for Black by returning the piece while depriving him of the right to castle. However, Black can easily castle artificially, for example: :5... Kxf7 6. Nxe4 Be7 7. 0-0 White castles \\"naturally\\". :7... Rf8 Black begins castling artificially. :8. d4 exd4 9. Nxd4 Kg8 (second diagram) Black has achieved a normal castled position (Rf8, Kg8), but in several moves. The absence of any pawns in the center indicates that king safety is of particular importance in this position. Black's development lags slightly, but he also possesses the bishop pair and a queenside pawn majority, so his position is at least equal. { style=\\"float:left;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" - valign=\\"top\\"   } In an even more common opening (a main line of the Benko Gambit, ECO A59), White uses the g2-square in an artificial castle maneuver to safeguard his king after an exchange of bishops on f1 precludes castling normally: :1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 Bxa6 6. Nc3 d6 7. e4 Bxf1 8. Kxf1 (first diagram) 8... g6 9. g3 Bg7 10. Kg2 0-0 11. Nf3 Nbd7 (second diagram). White has completed the artificial castle maneuver of his king and is ready to continue with 12.Re1 (or other moves). Praxis The following game between Jonathan Mestel and Sergey Makarichev played in Hastings 1979 features yet another way to artificially castle: :1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Nxe4 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. 0-0 Nxc3 6. dxc3 h6 7. Qd5 Qf6 8. Re1 Bd6 9. Nxe5 Bxe5 10. f4 d6 11. fxe5 dxe5 12. Bb5 Bd7 13. Bxc6 Bxc6 14. Rxe5+ Kf8 15. Qc5+ Kg8 16. Re2 Rd8 17. Be3 Kh7 (see diagram) The king has finally reached a safe haven and now Black takes over the initiative. 18. Qxa7? Rhe8 19. Rf2 Qg6 20. h3 Re4! 21. Bd4 Rd5! 22. Rd1 Rg5 23. Kf1 Re6 24. g4 Bb5+ 25. Kg1 Rxg4+! 26. Kh2 Rg3 27. Rdd2 Rxh3+! 28. Kxh3 Qh5+ A unique and even humorous artificial castling took place in the game Heidenfeld‚ÄìHecht, played in the Nice Chess Olympiad 1974: :1. e4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. e5 Ne4 4. d4 Nxc3 5. bxc3 e6 6. Bd3 c5 7. f4 Nc6 8. Nf3 Qa5 9. Bd2 Qa4! 10. Be3 c4 11. Be2 Ba3 12. Bc1? Qa5 (see diagram) White's queenside pawns were under heavy pressure, and \\"usual\\" moves such as 13.Bd2? Bb2, 13.Bxa3 Qxc3+! or 13.Qd2 Bxc1 would have all led to a loss of a pawn. So, White came up with the following unusual maneuver: 13. Kd2! Be7 14. Qe1 Bd7 15. Ke3 Now that the queen guards c3, the king can continue his journey to safety. 15... f6 16. Rf1 fxe5 17. fxe5 0-0 18. Kf2 Be8! 19. Kg1 White has \\"castled\\" in five moves instead of the usual one, but maintained material equality (although after 19...

Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., KYSR is the flagship station of syndicated morning drive program The Woody Show and the home of radio personality Andrew Harms. The KYSR studios are located in Burbank, while the station transmitter resides in the Santa Monica Mountains on Briarcrest Peak in Beverly Hills. In addition to a standard analog transmission, KYSR broadcasts over two HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio; KYSR also extends its signal by using a single full-power repeater: KSRY (103.1 FM) in Tehachapi.http://ibiquity.com/hd_radio/hdradio_find_a_station?state=SA&thisBeColorOver;=ff920f&thisBeColorOut;=11839d&theCity;=14#stationlist History =Early years= This station was built and signed on as KMGM, owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, on May 27, 1948. KMGM suspended operations in 1953, and the film studio sold KMGM's studio and transmitter to Art and Jean Crawford, who relaunched operations on June 30, 1954 as KCBH. The couple owned Crawford's of Beverly Hills Record & Hi-Fi Store, and used their store's inventory as a record library for the station. In October 1970, the station became \\"K-Joy\\" KJOI, and played beautiful music for nearly two decades. In 1976, KJOI was acquired by Command Communications.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-23 By 1989, KJOI began playing fewer instrumental cover versions of popular songs and added more vocalists to the playlist, eschewing middle of the road songs in favor of soft adult contemporary. Instrumentals were dropped altogether in November 1989, when the station became known as \\"Touch 98.7,\\" positioned between Smooth Jazz-formatted KTWV and Soft AC-formatted KOST. On February 12, 1990, the call letters were changed to KXEZ, with the format altered to \\"Easy Oldies.\\" =Adult contemporary era= On August 21, 1992, KXEZ became \\"Star 98.7\\", KYSR. Three FM Radio Changes Have One Thing in Common: Ratings; Programmers try different formats to attract coveted 25- to 54-year-old listeners, Los Angeles Times, August 28, 1992 In the beginning, KYSR aired an adult contemporary music format, which by 1993 evolved into hot adult contemporary; also in 1993, Viacom acquired the station for $40 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-46 MTV VJ Mark Goodman was heard on KYSR from 1996 to 1997; no official reason for his departure was given, but his father died shortly before his departure. Ryan Seacrest co- hosted KYSR's afternoon drive program with Lisa Foxx from 1995 to 2003; both hosts were among the top rated afternoon drive shows in Los Angeles for 7 years. By mid-1995, KYSR adjusted its format by dropping most of the rhythmic and soft rock tunes, shifting to a pop-leaning modern rock direction, minus the harder approach embraced by the more mainstream alternative KROQ. This version of Hot AC was called \\"modern adult contemporary\\", and became one of the first stations in the U.S. with the format. Viacom sold the station to Chancellor Media in 1997. The company was renamed AMFM Inc., after Chancellor Media merged with Capstar in 1999. In 2000, AMFM Inc. merged with its current owner, Clear Channel Communications, now known as iHeartMedia. Coincidentally, around this time, Viacom became the owners of KROQ when that station's parent company, CBS, merged with Viacom. Jamie, Frosty & Frank were hired as hosts for KYSR's morning drive program in 1998; Frosty Stilwell and Frank Kramer were fired on September 15, 1999, and Jamie White was paired with Danny Bonaduce. Bonaduce departed on July 1, 2005; his vacancy was filled by board- op Jack Heine and producer Mike \\"Stench\\" Roberts. Starting in 2002, KYSR began to experience a drop in its ratings due to a combination of factors, including the decline of hit music product in the modern adult contemporary genre, compounded later on by KCBS-FM's switch to an adult hits format. In September 2005, KYSR adjusted its playlist to focus on 1980s and 1990s hot adult contemporary music, supervised by sister station KHHT program director Mike Marino. By April 2006, KYSR moved back to a modern adult contemporary music format with the tag line of \\"Today's Music Alternative.\\" In addition, all on air personalities, including the morning show Jamie, Jack, and Stench, were temporarily pulled off the station; fans of the morning show were upset by this move, which included a public protest outside the station. Shortly afterwards, a poll was offered on the KYSR website asking if the listeners wanted Jamie, Jack and Stench to return. Ninety-seven percent said yes, and a week later, they returned to the air. However, Jamie, Jack and Stench were replaced a year later by the morning team of Sean Valentine and Lisa Foxx in 2007. =Evolution to alternative rock= On September 20, 2007, KYSR re- positioned itself as \\"98-7,\\" officially dropping the \\"Star\\" branding after 15 years. The station moved to a standard Alternative format, aimed more at young men, rather than Modern AC, aimed more at young women. While KYSR still reported to broadcasting trade publications as Modern AC, its musical lean favored Modern Rock/Alternative hits with an updated library of alternative titles from the 1980s, 90s and early 2000s, including Nirvana, Green Day, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Third Eye Blind and R.E.M.. In addition, KYSR played more new modern rock hits from bands such as The Killers, Foo Fighters, Incubus and Linkin Park. This repositioning came three days after sister station KBIG dropped many dance and disco hits, and rebranded as \\"104.3 MYfm.\\" Effective September 24, 2007, Sean Valentine moved over to the KBIG morning show, replacing Charlie Tuna, whose last show was September 17. KYSR changed positioning from Modern AC to Alternative in 2008 to compete with KROQ; while the core artists largely remained the same and leaned more in a pop direction than most alternative rock stations, the station's imaging was changed, along with a new logo holding the numbers 98 and 7 in Gothic typeface with a metallic star between the numerals. Both R&R;/Nielsen BDS and Mediabase concurrently added KYSR as an alternative/modern rock reporter.From Mediabase 24/7 On August 9, 2013, the station rebranded as \\"ALT 98.7,\\" with no other change to the format.KYSR Los Angeles Rebrands The Woody Show began airing in mornings on April 21, 2014, reuniting \\"Woody\\" Fife, Renae Ravey, Greg Gory and Jason \\"Menace\\" McMurry, who had all last worked together at KITS, an alternative rock station in San Francisco. The show proved so popular that the show began national syndication through Premiere Networks in 2016. \\"Damn Julianne\\" Miller was both a phone screener for The Woody Show and a weekend host on KYSR; she was one of several hundred employees fired by iHeart‚Äîalong with evening host Jake Dill‚Äîon January 20, 2020.

In addition to airing games, KYSR will also run contests and sweepstakes, with prizes including game tickets and official merchandise. The partnership will expand to events organized by sister station KIIS-FM beginning with its 2020 Jingle Ball.

The village has a Catholic church and a school. History The Kilmeena ambush was the scene of a defeat for the local Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. On 19 May 1921, British troops surprised an IRA ambush party at Kilmeena. Six IRA men were killed and seven wounded. The remainder of the column fled over the mountains to Skerdagh. One Royal Irish Constabulary man and one Black and Tans member were also killed in the action. The British forces threw the dead and wounded IRA men into the street outside the Police barracks in nearby Westport, causing widespread revulsion among the local people. GAA Kilmeena GAA Club was founded in 1889. Club records show that they played their first game against Westport at Kilmeena on 10 March 1889. The club was affiliated to the County Board in the same year. They contested their first county senior final against the mighty Ballina Stephenites and were beaten. Despite contesting a number of county finals at various levels without success throughout the following years, it wasn't until 1968 the first breakthrough came in the Junior A division, when the Club won the West Mayo Cusack Cup for the first time, beating Westport in the final in Westport. They had a further wait until 1977 before they won their first County Junior title, beating Carramore in the final in McHale Park Castlebar. The club secured their own grounds, Saint Brendan's Park, in 1938. Since then the playing pitch has been floodlit, and the club has hosted a number of training sessions for the Mayo county team.A new club house was formally opened in 2000.

Founded in 1920 as the Rochester, New York, chapter of the Poetry Society of America, the group ceased its affiliation with the Society in the 1980s in order to accept a wider variety of members. At that time, the organization adopted its current name. From June 2005 to May 2013, meeting/workshops were held monthly on the third (later fourth) Saturday at the Center at High Falls Gallery; the Gallery closed in June 2013, and subsequent meetings were held at various venues such as Panera Bread restaurants in the Rochester area. From 2003 to 2005, the organization held monthly readings at Writers & Books. In January 2006, the venue was changed to St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, NY, where it held a reading on the third Sunday of each month in the Ross Art Gallery of the Skalny Welcome Center. In August, 2015, the group moved to the Clover Center for Arts & Spirituality in Brighton, NY. In March 2017, they moved to the Legacy at Clover Blossom complex, also in Brighton, and to Legacy at Cranberry Landing in Irondequoit, NY in early 2018. A large portion of the Rochester Poetry Society and Rochester Poets correspondence, minutes and other documents from 1922 to 1973 are archived in the Rare Books and Special Collection Department of the Rush Rhees Library located at the University of Rochester. Activities Rochester Poets sends out regular email flyers of area literary events, publishes a monthly newsletter and The Pinnacle Hill Review*, an annual anthology of selected member work. The group maintains a website, a mailing list (informing subscribers of area literary events) which can be joined via the website, and a blog. From 2004 to 2011, Rochester Poets sponsored an annual Poets Against the War event for the Rochester area. From April 2007 until September 2009, they co-sponsored a monthly series of readings at the Anti-War Storefront of the Peace, Action & Education Committee of Rochester MetroJustice. In 2006, they began sponsoring annual World Poetry Day and National Poetry Month celebrations at St. John Fisher College in March and April of each year; the World Poetry Day event was merged with the April National Poetry Month event in 2009. The Celebration is open to poets, musicians and singers of all ages and levels from throughout the region. From 2007 to 2011, the group sponsored an Emerging Poets event in December of each year at St. John Fisher College. The event was open to poets of all ages; the primary criterion for eligibility was that participants were not yet \\"established\\" with a published volume of poems or had a significant number of poems appear in literary journals. From 2007 to 2011, the group also hosted the weekly Free Speech Zone series each Tuesday at the Tango Cafe in Rochester; the series moved to Mondays in 2011 before it was suspended in December 2011 pending finding a new venue. Publications The group's anthology has had various titles over the years, among them The Oracle, Touchstone, The Gleam, In Between Seasons, Images, Daylight Burning Lanterns, Disguised As Shapes You Love, and, most recently, The Pinnacle Hill Review. Many of the volumes are held by the Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection.

Rochester Poets Walk In 2009, officials of the City of Rochester, in conjunction with the Art Walk Project, which had created an area along University Avenue in Rochester in the \\"arts district\\", proposed an extension west along University and north and south along Goodman Street. The majority of the project would be along the sidewalks bordering two sides of Rochester's Memorial Art Gallery. The relationship between the City and Art Walk deteriorated, and eventually, a new entity, The Art Walk Extension Project, was created. Two of the proposed developments for the Extension were a Poets Walk, to be constructed in 2012 as a redesigned front sidewalk of MAG on University, and a Fiction Writers Walk, still in development, on the east side of the Gallery along Goodman. Many of those nominated for inclusion in Poets Walk were poets (a number of them deceased) who were members of Rochester Poets or had been honored by or affiliated with the group in some way. And many of those nominees were among the first inductees honored in November 2011. They included: Sam Abrams, Linda Allardt, John Ashbery, Anne C.

His methods, however, earned him infamy as a freebooter and a ravager: the ruined gables of burned buildings came to be known as \\"Knollys' mitres\\". Breton war of succession Born in Cheshire, Knolles first appears as the captain of several castles throughout Brittany in the mid-14th century, including Fougeray, Gravelle and Chateaublanc. He was one of the English champions at the Combat of the Thirty in 1351, where he was captured. He then contributed himself and 800 men to the 1356 chevauch√©e of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster through Normandy, a diversionary campaign to draw King John II of France north and thus leave the Black Prince free to embark on the famous Poitiers campaign. With France in disarray after the Battle of Poitiers, King Charles II of Navarre assumed command of the rebellion in Paris, and Knolles joined up with the army of Charles's brother Philip as they temporarily held the capital against the Dauphin in 1358. Knolles' finest hours were to come that autumn when he led a Great Company of 2,000‚Äì3,000 Anglo-Gascons into the Loire Valley, establishing several forward garrisons at important towns like Ch√¢teauneuf-Val-de-Bargis. He then advanced into the Nivernais, which was unsuccessfully defended for Margaret III of Flanders by the Archpriest Arnaud de Cervole, the adventurer who had raised the first Great Company the previous year. In 1359 Knolles reached Auxerre, which fell after a two-month siege on 10 March. After the city had surrendered, Knolles was knighted by two subordinates, previously he had formally only been ranked as a squire. The sack of Auxerre proceeded with little violence and destruction, Knolles and his soldiers were professionals who intended to maximize their profit. The city was carefully ransacked for valuables and the citizens assessed for ransom. At the end a huge ransom was extorted for not destroying the city, although this was only partly paid. The following month he returned to Chateauneuf to plot the invasion of the Rh√¥ne Valley with Hugh Calveley. Marching south, a forward base was established on the Allier River at Pont-du-Chateau, from where they launched the invasion of the Velay. Knolles then reunited with Calveley to besiege the important city of Le Puy, which fell in July 1359. As they continued to the Papal city of Avignon, their path was barred by the army of Thomas de la Marche, Deputy for Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, at which point both English commanders retreated and dissolved their companies. At the climax of the Breton War of Succession he participated in John de Montfort's siege of Auray in July 1364, the prelude to John's decisive victory at the Battle of Auray in September. He joined the Black Prince at the Battle of N√°jera (Navarrete) of 1367. French campaign In 1370 he was given a large grant of lands and money to raise an army to invade northern France. He landed at Calais in August with 6,000 mounted men and carried out a raid deep into French territory, burning villages on the outskirts of Paris but failing to bring the French King Charles V out to battle. He then turned towards Gascony and began capturing and fortifying castles and churches in the region between the rivers Loir and Loire. However he had to cope with much criticism from his younger subordinate commanders such as Sir John Minsterworth who were spoiling for a fight. When it became known that French armies under the command of Bertrand du Guesclin were closing in on them, Knolles proposed to retreat into Brittany but most of the army refused. He therefore marched away with his own retinue, leaving the bulk of the army where they were, to be comprehensively defeated and slaughtered at the Battle of Pontvallain on 4 December. Knolles passed the winter in his castle at Derval on the Breton March and afterwards attempted to evacuate his men and those of Minsterworth, who had managed to join him with his surviving troop, from the port of Saint-Mathieu. However, for lack of ships most of the English soldiers had to be left behind on the shore, to be wiped out by the French under Olivier de Clisson. In 1372 Knolles was found by the King's Council to bear the major responsibility for this disaster. He was stripped of the lands that had been given him as his fee for raising the army and fined 10,000 marks. Death and legacy He named Thomas Knollys as one of the executors of his estate in 1389. He died at his seat in Sculthorpe, Norfolk on 15 August 1407. He also founded Trinity Hospital, Pontefract and helped to suppress the Peasants' Revolt. Knolles' coat of arms decorates the postern tower of Bodiam Castle, Sussex. It was a statement of loyalty to Knolles by its builder, Edward Dalyngrigge who served under Knolles in a Free Company during the Hundred Years' War.

If there exists an antiisomorphism between two structures, they are said to be antiisomorphic. Intuitively, to say that two mathematical structures are antiisomorphic is to say that they are basically opposites of one another. The concept is particularly useful in an algebraic setting, as, for instance, when applied to rings. Simple example Let A be the binary relation (or directed graph) consisting of elements {1,2,3} and binary relation \\\\rightarrow defined as follows: * 1 \\\\rightarrow 2, * 1 \\\\rightarrow 3, * 2 \\\\rightarrow 1. Let B be the binary relation set consisting of elements {a,b,c} and binary relation \\\\Rightarrow defined as follows: * b \\\\Rightarrow a, * c \\\\Rightarrow a, * a \\\\Rightarrow b. Note that the opposite of B (denoted Bop) is the same set of elements with the opposite binary relation \\\\Leftarrow (that is, reverse all the arcs of the directed graph): * b \\\\Leftarrow a, * c \\\\Leftarrow a, * a \\\\Leftarrow b. If we replace a, b, and c with 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we see that each rule in Bop is the same as some rule in A. That is, we can define an isomorphism \\\\phi from A to Bop by \\\\phi(1) = a, \\\\phi(2) = b, \\\\phi(3) = c. \\\\phi is then an antiisomorphism between A and B. Ring anti-isomorphisms Specializing the general language of category theory to the algebraic topic of rings, we have: Let R and S be rings and f: R ‚Üí S be a bijection. Then f is a ring anti-isomorphism if :f(x +_R y) = f(x) +_S f(y) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{and} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ f(x \\\\cdot_R y) = f(y) \\\\cdot_S f(x) \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{for all } x,y \\\\in R. If R = S then f is a ring anti-automorphism. An example of a ring anti-automorphism is given by the conjugate mapping of quaternions: : x_0 + x_1 \\\\mathbf{i} + x_2 \\\\mathbf{j} + x_3 \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mapsto \\\\ \\\\ x_0 - x_1 \\\\mathbf{i} - x_2 \\\\mathbf{j} - x_3 \\\\mathbf{k}.

The coalition is associated with strong advocacy of the organizing model. The coalition currently consists of The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT); Service Employees International Union (SEIU); and United Farm Workers (UFW). Communications Workers of America (CWA) is affiliated with both CtWChange to Win Website, July 2017 http://www.changetowin.org/about-us/ and AFL-CIO. New Unity Partnership and formation of the federation At the dawn of the twenty-first century, labor union density (percentage of unionized American workers) was reaching a historic low point. From a high of over 30 percent in the 1950s, the proportion of American workers who were union members had plunged to 12 percent in the year 2000, and only 8 percent of private sector employees. A reformist coalition led by John Sweeney, then president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), had taken over the helm of the AFL‚ÄìCIO in 1995, but while the new regime was able to make some significant structural changes, they were not able to curtail the rapid decline of unions in the United States. In 2003, five unions joined together informally as the New Unity Partnership (NUP) to push for reform in the AFL- CIO and renewed effort to organize unorganized workers: The Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees (UNITE) and Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) (later to merge to form UNITE HERE), the United Brotherhood of Carpenters (UBC) and the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA). The NUP had no formal structure but pushed for coordinated, industry-based organizing campaigns and additional emphasis on organizing. Of the NUP members, the SEIU, with its president Andy Stern, was the most vocal proponent of change in the labor movement. (The current president is Mary Kay Henry.) At the union's 2004 convention, Stern declared that workers should reform the AFL-CIO or \\"build something stronger.\\" Over the next year, a discussion of the labor movement's future ensued with a degree of openness that was unusual for the often cloistered labor movement. In 2005, the NUP formally dissolved and its five member unions, along with the Teamsters Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), created a new coalition, Change to Win, which introduced a program for reform of the AFL-CIO. The coalition was founded on two basic principles: * Working people, including current union members, cannot win consistently without uniting millions more workers in unions. * Every worker in America has the right to a union that has the focus, strategy, and resources to unite workers in that industry and win. Among the coalition's proposals to achieve these objectives was encouraging unions to organize on an industry-wide basis, consolidating smaller unions within a few large unions, providing financial incentives to AFL-CIO member unions that channel resources to organizing new members and spending more money on organizing as opposed to electoral politics. The new union's members were largely service sector unions which represented large numbers of women, immigrants and people of color, as opposed to the manufacturing unions which formed the basis of labor's strength for many years. In July 2005, Change to Win elected SEIU secretary-treasurer Anna Burger as chair and UNITE HERE Executive Vice-President Edgar Romney as Treasurer. Changes in federation membership In the summer of 2009, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters disaffiliated from Change to Win.MacGillis, Alec. \\"For Unions, A Time of Opportunity and Worry.\\" The Washington Post. September 15, 2009. After a bitter and divisive internal battle, a third of the members of UNITE HERE left that union and joined SEIU.

Possible reunification with the AFL-CIO On January 9, 2009, national news media reported that the five of the seven CtW unions had met with seven of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO in talks which explored the possibility of the five CtW unions rejoining the larger labor federation.Maher, Kris. \\"AFL-CIO, Breakaway Unions Discuss Reuniting.\\" Wall Street Journal.

Also, several Change to Win unions also concluded that they were not getting any significant advantage from being in a separate labor federation, and that a fragmented labor union was doing more harm than good.Meyerson, Harold. \\"Labor's Real Fight.\\" Los Angeles Times. February 1, 2009. David Bonior, a former U.S. Congressman who once led the AFL-CIO's American Rights at Work division and who was a member of Barack Obama's presidential transition team, facilitated the meeting, and said talks were scheduled to last several weeks.Knowles, Francine. \\"AFL-CIO, Change to Win May Reunite.\\" Chicago Sun-Times. January 8, 2009. The five CtW unions present included the Laborers, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE HERE. AFL- CIO unions present included AFSCME, the AFT, the Electrical Workers, the UAW, and the United Steelworkers. Also in attendance was Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, which is independent and belongs to neither group. A number of major issues were discussed in the opening round of talks. One major point of discussion revolved around who would lead any reunited federation. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney was widely expected to retire at the trade union center's August 2009 convention, and Laborer's president Terence O'Sullivan and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka had been discussed as his successors.Ambinder, Marc. \\"Behind The Labor Merger Talks.\\" Atlantic Monthly. January 9, 2009. The nature of the AFL-CIO presidency was part of the leadership talks, with some unions suggesting that the presidency rotate among member unions while others hoped for a strong and vocal \\"executive director\\" position. The two sides agreed that any reunited labor federation should have a stronger voice in national politics as well as have a greater say in helping member unions engage in more new member organizing. The two sides also discussed whether to change the name of the AFL-CIO, or whether to adopt an entirely new organizational structure. Among other issues discussed were: How the AFL-CIO/new organization would encourage new member organizing and at what level (national or local), what a reunited labor movement's political priorities should be, what sort of relationship a reunited labor movement will have with the Democratic and Republican parties, the level of member union dues, and globalization issues. Although one news outlet reported that the 12 unions hoped to settle on a reunification agreement by April 15, 2009, no issues were resolved in the first round of talks. The talks drew some limited criticism from members of the labor movement for not addressing issues of union democracy.Leedham, Tom. \\"Reunification Without Democracy--What‚Äôs the Point?\\" Labor Notes. February 2009. Past campaigns Change to Win has focused its resources on organizing workers into unions. This focus has been written into its governing documents, which require at least 75% of CtW's resources and budget to be allocated to organizing programs. CtW and its affiliate unions have run several campaigns to organize workers in industries considered \\"core\\" to CtW unions. These campaigns are: * Make Work Pay: Make Work Pay is a general organizing campaign aimed at improving wages and working conditions for working people. * Justice at Smithfield: Organizes workers at Smithfield Foods pork-packing plants. Smithfield has been accused of human rights violations for its treatment of workers by international human rights group Human Rights Watch. * Wal-Mart Campaign: Organizes workers in Wal-Mart stores. * Driving Up Standards Together: Organizes school bus drivers and monitors across the country. An international campaign coordinated with the UK's Transport and General Workers Union (now part of Unite the Union). * Uniform Justice: Organizes employees of Cintas, North America's most profitable uniform and laundry company. * Cure CVS: Organizes CVS/Pharmacy and criticize its practices.

It is a successor of the Movie Battles mod for Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. The primary purpose of the mod is to allow players to experience setpiece battle scenes from the Star Wars films and the Star Wars expanded universe. Although most gameplay features from the base game remain, they received numerous modifications and improvements, while new ones have been added. The mod is notable for improving the lightsaber combat from Jedi Academy, which was already regarded as one of the best games in this regard. It also incorporates third- and first-person shooter elements. Movie Battles II is a team game, with players being able to join one of two sides at the beginning of every round: the Light Side or the Dark Side of the Force; depending on the map, either side will be represented by a different faction (the Galactic Republic / Rebel Alliance / Resistance for the Light Side, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) / Galactic Empire / First Order for the Dark Side), to reflect the various eras of Star Wars. Regardless of faction, each side features customizable character classes; in certain game modes, players only have access to pre-defined classes, which can't be customized. While Movie Battles II has several different game modes, all pit the two teams against each other, either to complete certain objectives, or to eliminate all members of the enemy team.

Movie Battles II is a team-based game that allows players to join either the Lights Side of the Force (represented by the Galactic Republic, the Rebel Alliance, or the Resistance, depending on the map) or the Dark Side (represented by the Separatists/CIS, the Galactic Empire, or the First Order). The game incorporates both lightsaber combat and shooter elements, and can be played from either a third- or first-person perspective. The lightsaber combat in Movie Battles has been substantially changed from the original game. Blocking and defensive moves are favored over the unmodded game's \\"swing- spam\\". There are meters for both force pool and block stamina which deplete as the player intercepts incoming blaster and lightsaber attacks. Similarly to games like Counter-Strike, Movie Battles uses an objective system, where one team defends and the other one attacks one or more objectives. Objective types are usually variants on common themes, such as \\"slicing panels\\", or NPC guarding. Every round, the attacking team must complete their given objective within a given amount of time, while the defending team tries to delay them until the timer runs out; alternatively, each team can win by eliminating all members of the enemy team. Any player who is killed before the end of the round becomes a spectator. They may follow certain players who are still alive or free-roam in the spectator cam, similar to other first-person shooters, such as Battlefield 2. Besides communicating with other players, the chat is used for voting. Players may vote to change the map or the game mode. The game also incorporates a voice chat, which is used to give quick commands to the rest of the team, such as \\"Attack\\", \\"Defend Position\\", and \\"Charge\\". = Classes = Most game modes in Movie Battles II let players choose between multiple character classes to play as. Players may select iconic Star Wars characters as \\"skins\\" for these classes, and are given a limited number of points to upgrade stats and abilities; every class has a different playstyle and a few unique abilities. If playing as Jedi or Sith, players can also customize their lightsaber hilt. * Soldiers - the most basic class, it is available for both the Light Side and the Dark Side. Soldiers are equipped only with a blaster, a pistol and possibly grenades, but can have up to three lives, allowing them to respawn multiple times during the same round. * Elite Troopers / Commanders - a superior version of Soldiers, the Elite Troopers and their Dark Side equivalent, the Commanders, have overall better weapons and stats, but can have only two lives. They can also have a unique ability called \\"Rally\\", which allows soldiers to respawn next to them. * Jedi / Sith - Jedi and their Dark Side equivalent, Sith, can use lightsabers and the Force in combat. Both can use their lightsaber to deflect blaster fire or lightsaber strikes, and have Force abilities such as Push (used to push enemies), Pull (used to disarm or pull enemies), Jump (used to jump higher than regular classes and stick to walls), and Sense (used to see allies and enemies through walls and on the map HUD). Jedi can also use Force Speed and Mind Trick, while Sith can use Force Choke and Lightning. All these Force powers, as well as blocking attacks with the lightsaber, cost Force Points to use, which regenerate over time. * Heroes / Bounty Hunters - Heroes and their Dark Side equivalent, Bounty Hunters, are a marksman class. They have the best overall weapons in the game, including a sniper rifle, and can have one or more special abilities. Heroes can quickly dodge incoming blaster fire or lightsaber strikes and heal damage over time, while Bounty Hunters have tracking and poison darts. * Wookiees - A class exclusive to the Light Side, Wookiees can deal high amounts of damage with their melee attacks, killing most enemies with only a few punches. They also have very high HP and a special ability called \\"Rage\\", which reduces the amount of damage they receive and the damage they deal for a short time period. Wookiees can also be equipped with weapons like bowcasters and frag grenades. * Clone Troopers - A class exclusive to the Light Side, clone troopers are armed with repeater blaster rifles and a pistol. The rifle can be upgraded into a minigun or to fire ion and electricity blasts, while the pistol can be upgraded to fire bolts that ricochet on walls. Clones can also have one additional life. * Advanced Recon Commandos (ARC Troopers) - A class exclusive to the Light Side, ARC Troopers are a superior version of Clone Troopers. They can have dexterity, which allows them to roll to dodge attacks, jump higher, and run on walls, as well as roll instead of being knocked down. The ARC Troopers can be equipped with one or two pistols, a rocket launcher, and a blaster rifle, which can be converted into a sniper rifle or a grenade launcher. * Mandalorians - A class exclusive to the Dark Side, Mandalorians have jetpacks and are armed with one or two Westar Pistols and a blaster rifle (which can be converted into a sniper rifle). They can also have a flamethrower, a wrist laser, and a one-use jetpack rocket. * Droidekas - A class exclusive to the Dark Side, Droidekas are equipped with shields and arm-mounted blasters, which have unlimited ammunition, but need to be recharged. While slow in their regular form, they can change into their rolling form to move faster, although this makes them more vulnerable. Droidekas can also discharge their shield, unleashing a shockwave that knocks down all nearby enemies. * Super Battle Droids - A class exclusive to the Dark Side, SBDs are large and slow, but have very much HP. They are equipped with arm-mounted blasters and also have one melee attack, with which they can instantly knock down most enemies. However, SBDs rely very much on their internal battery, which affects both their firepower and damage reduction, making them almost useless when the battery is depleted. To recharge the battery faster, they can activate the low power mode, but this makes them even slower and unable to fire their weapons. SBDs can also have advanced logic (which makes them immune to Jedi mind tricks), advanced targeting (which gives them a zoom-in option for their weapon), and advanced radar (which allows them to see enemies on the map HUD when in low power mode). = Game modes = * Open - the basic game mode of Movie Battles II, it pits two teams (attackers and defenders) against each other; the attackers attempt to complete a certain objective, while the defenders try to stop them. Each player can select between the classes corresponding to their side, which are fully customizable. * Duel - this mode revolves around lightsaber duels. Players can only play as Jedi or Sith (who are fully customizable), and have three lives; if a player loses all their lives and dies, they will be able to respawn shortly after. As such, there is no real winner in this game mode, as its only purpose is to recreate iconic duels from the Star Wars saga. * Full Authentic - similarly to the Open mode, this mode pits a team of attackers against a team of defenders. The difference is that players don't have access to customizable classes; instead, they must choose from a limited number of characters with pre-defined traits. Each character is accurate to the map, as the mode's purpose is to recreate scenarios from the Star Wars saga exactly the way they were originally depicted (therefore its name). Some characters have unique abilities that can't be found in the Open mode, thus giving them some diversity. * Semi-Authentic - a combination of the Open and Full Authentic modes. It plays very similarly to the former, except that players can only select characters that are accurate to the map. Unlike the Full Authentic mode, the characters' abilities can be customized by the player, similarly to the classes from the Open mode. * Legends - similarly to the Full Authentic mode, this mode lets players choose only from a limited number of character with pre-defined traits. The difference is that these characters aren't map-accurate, and are the same across all maps, regardless of the era they are set in.  Development  Movie Battles was started by Richard Hart (online alias RenegadeOfPhunk) in 2003, with the goal of mixing the round- and objective-based gameplay of Counter-Strike with the lightsaber and gun mechanics of Star Wars. The first versions of the mod were developed for Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, the third game in the Jedi Knight series. This version already had the key elements of Movie Battles in it, such as the modified lightsaber combat and the last man standing system. The mod was later remade for Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. A spin-off of Movie Battles II, titled The New Era (TNE), was developed using Source engine, which would have allowed for improved graphics and a better physics engine, but was cancelled in 2013. While meant to be a successor to Movie Battles II, the mod would have been closer to the deathmatch genre. Many members of the development team for TNE were also part of the Movie Battles team. On April 2, 2011, a trailer revealing a sequel was released. Movie Battles 3 was going to be a standalone, free game developed on the Unreal Engine, but due to a general disinterest among developers and the game's community, coupled with the lack of developers willing to stay on board the project to begin with, it was cancelled after a few years in development. Since then, developers have focused on expanding and improving Movie Battles II, with several updates being released every year. The latest update, 1.6.2.2, was released on July 8, 2020.  Reception  In 2005 the UK edition of PC Gamer printed an article covering the mod. In the same year Sky News mentioned Movie Battles alongside other user-made game modifications. It was also mentioned by Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Alec Meer in the sites 2015 list of best Star Wars video games. Of the mod, Meer said the mod was something players should \\"probably [...] check out.\\" Matthew Znadowicz of Eurogamer Poland called the game's action \\"unique and fresh\\", yet noted that battles often became \\"stressful, intense, but extremely pleasant.\\"> As of June 2016, 400 users on the website Mod DB have rated the game with the average score of 9.4.

Stereotypically, pochos speak English and lack fluency in Spanish. Among some Mexican Americans, the term has been embraced to express pride in having both a Mexican and an American heritageHandbook of Hispanic Cultures in the United States: Anthropology, Volume 4 By Nicol√°s Kanellos, Thomas Weaver, Claudio Esteva F√°bregat (1994) pg.182 asserting their place in the diverse American culture. The word derives from the Spanish word pocho, used to describe fruit that has become rotten or discolored. In general, the word \\"pocho\\" can sometimes have these different meanings: * A Mexican-American who can speak little or no Spanish. * An American who speaks Spanish and acts \\"Mexican\\". * The Anglicized Spanish spoken by a \\"Pocho\\" (known in English as \\"Spanglish\\") * A person who frequently crosses the US-Mexican border and feels at home on both sides of the border. * A nickname in Argentina (Pocho or Pocha). For example, the popular president Juan Domingo Per√≥n was called \\"El Pocho\\" as well as the Argentinian football players Ezequiel Iv√°n Lavezzi and Federico Insua. * A 1959 Chicano novel by Jos√© Antonio Villarreal. Pochos are usually identified by their use of poorly-spoken Spanish. Code switching and the use of loanwords is common as is the use of phrases popular in American culture translated to Spanish, sometimes literally. Code switching often involves inserting English preposition or objective nouns, such as, \\"Voy a ir shopping ahora en el supermarket\\" (I am going shopping now at the supermarket). Modified loanwords are referred to as \\"pochismos\\". Examples include mopear for trapear (to mop),troque for camion (truck), parquear for estacionar (to park), or chequear for mirar or verificar (to check, to inspect or to verify).

It has extensive sea coasts along its west and north boundaries. The main towns are Belmullet and Bangor Erris. The name Erris derives from the Irish 'Iar Ros' meaning 'western promontory'. The full name is the Iorrais Domnann, after the Fir Bolg tribe, the Fir Domnann. To its north is the wild Atlantic Ocean and the bays of Broadhaven and Sruth Fada Conn and to its west is Blacksod Bay. Its main promontories are the Doohoma Peninsula, Mullet Peninsula, Erris Head, the D√∫n Chiort√°in and D√∫n Chaoch√°in peninsulas and Benwee Head.Ireland's History in Maps - Baronies page 3 There are five Catholic parishes in Erris: Kilcommon, Kilmore, Kiltane, Belmullet and Ballycroy. Gaeltacht The Stags of Broadhaven Bay with Benwee Head in the foreground Parts of Erris are in a Gaeltacht area, with first- language speakers of Irish in the following areas of the barony: An F√°l M√≥r, Tamhaiin na hUlta√≠, Glais, Eachl√©im, Tearmann, Tr√°nn, An Mullach Rua, Cart√∫r, An Baile √ör, Cill Ghallag√°in, Corr√°n Bu√≠, Ceathr√∫ na gCloch, Port a' Chluaidh, Ros Dumhach and Ceathr√∫ Thaidhg. The area with the most Irish speakers is Ceathr√∫ Thaidhg. There are between 3,500-5,000 native Irish speakers in Erris.  Geography  = Topography and geology = Bangor Way way-marked walking trail Much of inland Erris is covered with blanket bog. A triangle between Ballycroy, Bellacorick and Bangor Erris consists of little else over its surface. Blanket bog, unlike raised bog, grows slowly across the landscape like a blanket covering the ground, due to a continuous supply of water from rainfall, maintaining waterlogged conditions on the ground. The bog is acidic with a pH of between 3.5 and 4.2. This is Atlantic blanket bog and it provides a suitable habitat for many species of flora, particularly small species of mosses, bryophytes, carnivorous plants and delicate flowers such as the scarlet pimpernel. Species of fauna found on Atlantic blanket bog, include smaller varieties such as frogs and insects as well as many bird varieties, not common elsewhere. Dolphins in Sruwaddacon Bay August 2010 Several areas of the blanket bog are protected under European legislation such as Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas (Birds Directive) and Natural Heritage Areas. These include the Glenamoy Bog Complex, Ballycroy National Park and Bellacorick. Erris has a large range of habitats including blanket bogs, estuaries, salt marshes, fresh water lakes, coasts, cliffs, machair, sand dunes, sandy beaches and rocky shores. It is an important area for bird watchers as the largely treeless landscape allows relatively easy access for birdwatching. Brent geese overwinter here feeding along the estuaries, and corncrake, chough, rock dove and twite are sometimes seen at Erris Head. Sightings of rarer birds, such as the grey phalarope, booted warbler and Wilson's petrel, have also been recorded. The oldest rocks in Ireland, some 1.8 billion years old, are to be found on the west coasts of Erris. Pink or orange striped gneisses are found along the beaches of Elly Bay and Annagh Head where they have become separated from the same rocks on the east coast of Northern Canada over hundreds of millions of years by the separation of tectonic plates in the mid Atlantic Ocean. \\"Erris Head\\" (Irish: Ceann Iorrais) is a promontory at the northernmost tip of the Mullet Peninsula. It is a landmark known well by mariners and is one of the sea areas cited by Met √âireann's weather forecasters. The coastline of Erris has some of \\"the grandest sea cliffs in Ireland\\" over the Atlantic Ocean from where the next stop is the east coast of America. Erris Head is not served by any road and can only be reached by crossing a number of fields from the hamlet of Glenlara where the road ends. =Settlements and islands= Along the coast there are several uninhabited islands. These include the Inishkea Islands, Inishglora, Duvillaun, the Stags of Broadhaven Bay and other smaller islands.Erris Islands: moduvill, glora, inishkea View across Erris blanket bog southwards from Carrowmore Lake An D√∫na at Kilgalligan, Kilcommon, Erris  Archaeology and history  A little stone circle at Gortbrack, Kilcommon parish, Erris. Erris, in common with most of inland Ireland, became covered in extensive native woodland a few thousand years after the last Ice Age retreated (approx 15,000 years ago) but its northern and western shores remained relatively lightly afforested. Across inland Erris, the remains of these forests can be seen across the blanket bog landscape in the form of fossilised greying tree stumps which are mainly the remains of ancient Scots pine trees. These become most obvious where there has been harvesting of turf (peat) for fuel. The odd petrified bog oak can be found too. During the Neolithic period, starting about 6,000 years ago, the first people living in Ireland whose ancestors had hunted and gathered along the coastlines of Erris from about 9,000 years ago, began to cut down the forestry to clear land for growing crops and grazing livestock. Because the underlying rock type was ancient and heavily weathered schists the soil was thin and easily eroded by inclement weather. After a couple of years the crops began to fail and the Neolithic people had to clear the native woodlands further and further inland to clear more land for their crops. With minor changes in climate and high rainfall levels the land became blanketed by the bog and remains that way to the current day. When present-day turf cutters harvest the bog for fuel, archaeological remains, mainly from the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, which have become buried under the bog often come to light.For information on the archaeology of Kilcommon parish, see Comhar D√∫n Chaoch√°in Teo in Carrowteige. Some archaeological sites are marked on Ordnance Survey maps. The period of Early Christianity saw several small churches set up but no major religious houses came to the area. During the Plantations of Ireland, there were two major landlords in the area - the Binghams and the Carters. Oliver Cromwell's policy (mid 17th century) of sending the native Irish who refused to bow down to him \\"to hell or to Connaught\\" saw a large influx of population into Erris where the disinherited native Irish tried to eke a living from very poor quality agricultural land under the tenancy of the landlords and their agents. During the Irish Famine of 1845 - '47 many died in Erris despite the close proximity of the sea, because they could not raise the cash to fund a passage to America. Some 19th- and early 20th-century antiquarians and surveyors visited the Erris area and wrote about their experiences and thoughts on the area at that time. These include works by Patrick Knight (Erris in the Irish Highlands), Caesar Otway (Sketches in Erris and Tyrawley) and Thomas Johnson Westropp (The Promontory Forts and Early Remains of the Coast of Mayo). The Ulster Cycle legend of the T√°in B√≥ Flidhais concerns the Barony of Erris in the time period of approx the 1st century AD. = Rescue 116 search = The community of Erris gave support to the extensive search and rescue operation following the 2017 Irish Coast Guard Rescue 116 crash. For its efforts, the community and the Irish Coast Guard were awarded a People of the Year Award in 2018.  Legend and folklore  Folklore is an important part of the culture of Erris. A number of well- known folklore tales have their origins in (or are associated with) the area. The Children of Lir, according to tradition, are buried on the island of Inisglora. The children were turned into swans by their jealous stepmother and doomed to spend the next 900 years on lakes and waters in Ireland. When they finally reclaimed their human form on Inisglora, they were so old that they died and were buried there. T√°in B√≥ Flidhais is the tale of a cattle raid in which raiders came to Erris from the Royal site at Cruach√°n (Rathcroghan) at Tulsk, Co. Roscommon to Rathmorgan Fort (Iorras Domhnann) at the south end of Carrowmore Lake in the centre of the Barony. The remains of Rathmorgan fort on top of the mountain can be seen from the road below. Brian Rua U'Cearbhain from Inver is remembered in folklore as the prophet of Erris. The small village of Glencastle has some large mounds in the narrow valley that are not naturally occurring. They can be seen on the right hand side, close to the roadside on the approach to Belmullet from the east. These have never been archaeologically investigated but folklore legends recall that this was the old gateway into the Mullet and a toll had to be paid for each traveller who passed through or the traveller may never be seen again. There were no roads through this area of Mayo until less than two hundred years ago. In recent years the Glencastle Valley has been drastically altered by extensive quarrying.  Water sports  Kite buggying fun at Claggan Island tombola, Erris Erris is a popular location for many types of watersports ranging through fishing, sailing, surfing, swimming, wind surfing, kiteboarding and kite surfing.  Walking trails  There are a number of walking trails in Erris. These include cliff walks above the Atlantic at Broadhaven Bay along Benwee Head, Glinsk and the North Mayo coastline, as well as mountain walks across uninhabited natural wilderness, and long distance walks such as the Bangor Trail and the Western Way. In 1993, the T√≠r S√°ile Sculpture Trail project was carried out to commemorate 5,000 years of habitation in County Mayo. This trail extends through parts of Erris from the tip of the Mullet Peninsula, through Kilcommon, Belderrig and Ballycastle. The first sculptures along this trail were erected in 1993, with several more added subsequently. The creation of the sculpture trail took the form of the Meitheal, a traditional method of working where a group of workers come together to achieve a common objective.  Natural resources  Erris has considerable potential for ocean energy in terms of its location next to the Atlantic Ocean and constant winds from the sea. These resources have been earmarked for development.Western People - Wave farm in pipeline for Erris - October 2009 There are opportunities for the development of ocean wave power projects, tidal power, hydroelectric schemes, and, wind farms amongst other clean, alternative energy generation opportunities for which the area is eminently suitable. = Corrib gas field = Garda S√≠och√°na at Bellanaboy The discovery of the Corrib gas field in the Atlantic Ocean some 85 km off Broadhaven Bay has led to the Corrib gas project and ensuing controversy. Raw, unodourised natural gas from fields under the Atlantic Ocean is planned to be piped at high pressure at Glengad and through the townlands of Kilcommon, to a refinery 10 km inland. Documentaries have been made on the subject . A documentary film, The Pipe by local film-maker, Richard O'Donnell, had its first showing at the Galway Film Festival on Thursday 8 July 2010, went on general release in cinemas nationwide from 3 December 2010.

The Great Blue Hole is near the center of the photograph. Coral (alt= The Great Blue Hole is a giant marine sinkhole off the coast of Belize. It lies near the center of Lighthouse Reef, a small atoll from the mainland and Belize City. The hole is circular in shape, across and deep. It was formed during several episodes of quaternary glaciation when sea levels were much lower. Analysis of stalactites found in the Great Blue Hole shows that formation took place 153,000; 66,000; 60,000; and 15,000 years ago. As the ocean began to rise again, the cave was flooded. The Great Blue Hole is a part of the larger Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, a World Heritage Site of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Exploration and name This site was made famous by Jacques Cousteau, who declared it one of the top five scuba diving sites in the world. In 1971 he brought his ship, the Calypso, to the hole to chart its depths. Investigations by this expedition confirmed the hole's origin as typical karst limestone formations, formed before rises in sea level in at least four stages, leaving ledges at depths of , , and . Stalactites were retrieved from submerged caves, confirming their previous formation above sea level. Some of these stalactites were also off-vertical by 5Àö in a consistent orientation, indicating that there had also been some past geological shift and tilting of the underlying plateau, followed by a long period in the current plane. The tilt indicates that this was a movement of the land, rather than a rise in sea level alone. Initial measured depth of Great Blue Hole was which is the most often cited depth up to this day. An expedition by the Cambrian Foundation in 1997 measured the hole's depth as at its deepest point. This difference in measurement can be explained by ongoing sedimentation or by imprecision in measurements. The expedition's goal was to collect core samples from the Blue Hole's floor and document the cave system. To accomplish these tasks, all of the divers had to be certified in cave diving and mixed gases. In December 2018, two submarines descended into the Blue Hole, in an attempt to map its interior. Using sonar scanning, the team was nearly able to complete a 3-D map of the 1,000 foot wide hole. Tourism This is a popular spot among recreational scuba divers who are lured by the opportunity to dive in sometimes crystal-clear water and meet several species of fish, including midnight parrotfish, Caribbean reef shark, and other juvenile fish species. Other species of sharks, such as the bull shark and hammerheads, have been reported there, but are not regularly sighted. Usually, day trips to the Great Blue Hole are full-day trips from the coastal tourist communities in Belize. On-shore caves of similar formation, as large collapsed sinkholes, are well known in Belize and in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, where they are known as cenotes. Unlike the mainland cenotes which often link to underwater cave systems, there is little evidence of horizontal development in the Blue Hole. In 2012 Discovery Channel ranked the Great Blue Hole as number one on its list of \\"The 10 Most Amazing Places on Earth\\". In 2018, they featured a two-hour special titled Discovery Live: Into the Blue Hole featuring Erika Bergman, Fabien Cousteau and Richard Branson.

He was known as 'the Werewolf of Bedburg'.  Sources  The most comprehensive source on the case is a pamphlet of 16 pages published in London in 1590, the translation of a German print of which no copies have survived. The English pamphlet, of which two copies exist (one in the British Museum and one in the Lambeth Library), was rediscovered by occultist Montague Summers in 1920. It describes Stumpp's life, alleged crimes and the trial, and includes many statements from neighbours and witnesses of the crimes.Orenstein, Catherine (2002) Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale.

Additional information is provided by the diaries of Hermann von Weinsberg, a Cologne alderman, and by a number of illustrated broadsheets, which were printed in southern Germany and were probably based on the German version of the London pamphlet.

The name \\"Stump\\" or \\"Stumpf\\" may have been given him as a reference to the fact that his left hand had been cut off leaving only a stump, in German \\"Stumpf\\". It was alleged that as the \\"werewolf\\" had its left forepaw cut off, then the same injury proved the guilt of the man. Stumpp was born at the village of Epprath near the country-town of Bedburg in the Electorate of Cologne. His actual date of birth is not known, as the local church registers were destroyed during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). He was a wealthy farmer of his rural community.Blundell, Nigel (1997) Encyclopedia of Serial Killers. Promotional Reprint Co. p.165 During the 1580s, he seems to have been a widower with two children; a girl called Beele (Sybil), who seems to have been older than fifteen years old, and a son of an unknown age.  Accusations  During 1589, Stumpp had one of the most lurid and famous werewolf trials of history. After being stretched on a rack, and before further torture commenced, he confessed to having practiced black magic since he was twelve years old. He claimed that the Devil had given him a magical belt or girdle, which enabled him to metamorphose into \\"the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and large, which in the night sparkled like fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body, and mighty paws.\\" Removing the belt, he said, made him transform back to his human form. No such belt was ever found after his arrest. For twenty-five years, Stumpp had allegedly been an \\"insatiable bloodsucker\\" who gorged on the flesh of goats, lambs, and sheep, as well as men, women, and children. Being threatened with torture he confessed to killing and eating fourteen children, two pregnant women, whose fetuses he ripped from their wombs and \\"ate their hearts panting hot and raw,\\" which he later described as \\"dainty morsels.\\" One of the fourteen children was his own son, whose brain he was reported to have devoured. Not only was Stumpp accused of being a serial murderer and cannibal, but also of having an incestuous relationship with his daughter, who was sentenced to die with him, and that he had coupled with a distant relative, which was also considered to be incestuous according to the law. In addition to this he confessed to having had intercourse with a succubus sent to him by the Devil.  Execution  Composite woodcut print by Lukas Mayer of the execution of Peter Stumpp in 1589 at Bedburg near Cologne. The execution of Stumpp, on 31 October 1589, alongside his daughter Sybil and mistress, Katherine, is one of the most brutal on record: he was put to a wheel, where \\"flesh was torn from his body\\", in ten places, with red-hot pincers, followed by his arms and legs. Then his limbs were broken with the blunt side of an axehead to prevent him from returning from the grave, before he was beheaded and his body burned on a pyre. His daughter and mistress had already been flayed and strangled, and were burned along with Stumpp's body. As a warning against similar behavior, local authorities erected a pole with the torture wheel and the figure of a wolf on it, and at the very top they placed Peter Stumpp's severed head. In popular culture *The U.S. metal band Macabre recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled \\"The Werewolf of Bedburg\\"; it can be found on the Murder Metal album. *The German horror punk band The Other recorded a song about Peter Stumpp, titled \\"Werewolf of Bedburg\\" on their Casket Case album. *In the Pine Deep Trilogy of novelist and folklorist Jonathan Maberry, Peter Stumpp is the supernatural villain Ubel Griswold. Since Griswold is actually one of Stumpp's historical aliases, Maberry decided to use the name of Ubel Griswold instead of openly telling people that the villain was the infamous werewolf Peter Stumpp until later on in the third book of the series, Bad Moon Rising. *A reference to Peter Stumpp is also made in William Peter Blatty's book, The Exorcist. When Father Karras and Kinderman talk about Satanism they say \\"Terrible, was this theory, Father, or fact?\\" \\"Well, there's William Stumpf, for example. Or Peter. I can't remember. Anyway, a German in the sixteenth century who thought he was a werewolf\\". *The direct-to-video Big Top Scooby- Doo!, uses a portion of Lukas Mayer's woodcut of the execution of Stumpp in 1589, though in the movie no mention of Stumpp is made. The portion used depicts a man cutting off a werewolf's left paw (supposedly Stumpp in werewolf form) and a child being attacked by a werewolf. The woodcut scene shown in the film restores the werewolf's left paw and removes the child in the second werewolf's jaws, making it appear as if the swordsman is fighting one of the werewolves while another flees. *In the Doctor Who audio drama Loups-Garoux, Pieter Stubbe was in fact a werewolf. He managed to escape before he was executed and lived for another five centuries. He was defeated by the Fifth Doctor in Brazil in 2080. It is implied that he ate both the Grand Duchess Anastasia and Lord Lucan. *Journalist and fiction writer J. E. Reich partially based her short story \\"The Werewolves of Anspach\\" on the life of Peter Stumpp. *The story of Peter Stumpp was also told in episode 3 of the podcast Lore, released on April 6, 2015. In 2017, the podcast episode was adapted into the fifth episode of the TV series adaptation of Lore, where he was played by Adam Goldberg.

He is the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, an American multinational investment management corporation. BlackRock is the largest money-management firm in the world with more than $6.5 trillion in assets under management.Suzanna Andrews: Larry Fink's $12 Trillion Shadow, Vanity Fair, April 2010 Although BlackRock is private, its 6.96 trillion dollars in assets and wide range of investments gives the firm enormous power over the global financial system. Activists and economic watchdogs have tried to get BlackRock designated as a systemically important financial institution (or SIFI), which would subject it to the highest legal standards for safety and transparency. In April 2018, Fink's net worth was $1 billion. He is also a lifelong major Democratic donor. Early life and education Fink was born on November 2, 1952.\\"Laurence Fink: Executive Profile & Biography\\", Businessweek. He grew up in a Jewish family in Van Nuys, California, where his mother was an English professor and his father owned a shoe store. He earned a BA in Political Science from UCLA in 1974. Fink is also a member of Kappa Beta Phi. He then received an MBA in Real Estate at the UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management in 1976. Career = 1970 to 2000 = Fink started his career in 1976 at First Boston, a New York-based investment bank. Eventually taking charge of First Boston's bond department, Fink was instrumental in the creation and development of the mortgage-backed security market in the United States. At First Boston, Fink was a member of the Management Committee, a Managing Director, and co-head of the Taxable Fixed Income Division; he also started the Financial Futures and Options Department, and headed the Mortgage and Real Estate Products Group.\\"Laurence Fink - News, Articles, Biography, Photos - WSJ.com\\", Wall Street Journal. Retrieved October 14, 2011. Fink added as much as $1 billion to First Boston's bottom line. He was successful at the bank until 1986, when his department lost $100 million due to his incorrect prediction about interest rates. The experience influenced his decision to start a company that would invest clients' money while also incorporating comprehensive risk management. In 1988, under the corporate umbrella of The Blackstone Group, Fink co-founded BlackRock and became its Director and CEO. When BlackRock split from Blackstone in 1994, Fink retained his positions, which he continued to hold after BlackRock became more independent in 1998. His other positions at the company have included Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Executive and Leadership Committees, Chair of Corporate Council, and Co-Chair of the Global Client committee. BlackRock went public in 1999. BlackRock is the largest investor in fossil fuels on earth, playing so central a role in financing climate change that it is the subject of the ‚ÄúBlackRock‚Äôs Big Problem‚Äù campaign by environmental groups like the Sierra Club. BlackRock is also a major investor in military weapons. One of BlackRock's exchange traded funds (ETFS) is the ‚ÄúiShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF‚Äù, a fund for investors looking to support companies like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. = 2000s = Fink, third from right, receiving a Woodrow Wilson Award in April 2010 In 2003, Fink helped to negotiate the resignation of the CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso, who was widely criticized for his $190 million pay package. In 2006 Fink led the merger with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, which doubled BlackRock's asset management portfolio. That same year, BlackRock's $5.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town‚ÄìPeter Cooper Village, a Manhattan housing complex, became the largest residential-real-estate deal in U.S. history. When the project ended in default, BlackRock clients lost their money, including the California Pension and Retirement System, which lost about $500 million. The U.S. government contracted with BlackRock to help clean up after the financial meltdown of 2008. Although BlackRock is widely believed to have been the best choice for the cleanup job,Andrews, Suzanna. Larry Fink‚Äôs $12 Trillion Shadow, Vanity Fair, April 2010: \\"There is little doubt among the financial establishment in Washington and on Wall Street that BlackRock was the best choice to handle the government‚Äôs problems.\\" Fink's longstanding relationships with senior government officials have led to questions about potential conflict of interest regarding government contracts awarded without competitive bidding. BlackRocks contract allowed Fink to cultivate relationships with Obama's first Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and additional members of the Obama economic recovery team. In 2016 Fink hoped to become part of the federal government himself as Hillary Clinton's Treasury Secretary. At the same time, Blackrock hired many former executive branch appointees to its firm including Cheryl Mills, Christopher Meade, Katheryn Rosen, Michael Pyle, Coryann Stefansson, Gary Reeder, and Ken Wilson. This move strengthened BlackRock's revolving door with the federal government. In December 2009, BlackRock purchased Barclays Global Investors, at which point the company became the largest money-management firm in the world. Despite his great influence, Fink is not widely known publicly, apart from his regular appearances on CNBC. BlackRock paid Fink $23.6 million in 2010. By 2016, BlackRock had $5 trillion under management, with 12,000 employees in 27 countries.BlackRock shapes shifts NYTimes, September 16, 2016 In 2016, Fink received the ABANA Achievement Award in New York City. It recognizes an individual who exemplifies outstanding leadership in banking and finance and has a commitment to positive professional cooperation between the US and the Middle East and North Africa. In 2018, Fink was ranked #28 on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People. During the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 the Fed has turned to BlackRock to help it purchase distressed securities in an echo of 2008. Larry Fink is also longtime donor and supporter of the New York City Police Foundation: a group that provides financial support to the New York City Police Department. The non-profit Color of Change called on Fink to divest from the NYC Police Foundation in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and subsequent nationwide protests. Community involvement Fink serves on the board of trustees of New York University, where he holds various chairmanships including chair of the Financial Affairs Committee. He also co- chairs the NYU Langone Medical Center board of trustees and is a trustee of the Boys and Girl's Club of New York. Fink is also on the board of the Robin Hood Foundation. Fink founded the Lori and Laurence Fink Center for Finance & Investments at UCLA Anderson in 2009, and currently serves as chairman of the board. In December 2016, Fink joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues. In his 2018 annual open letter to CEOs, he called for corporations to play an active role in improving the environment, working to better their communities, and increasing the diversity of their workforces. This has been taken as evidence of a move by Blackrock, one of the largest public investors, to proactively enforce these targets. In his 2019 open letter Fink said that companies and their CEOs must step into a leadership vacuum to tackle social and political issues when governments fail to address these issues. After the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, Fink in October 2018 cancelled plans to attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia. In his 2020 annual open letter, Fink announced environmental sustainability as core goal for BlackRock's future investment decisions. In this letter, he explained how climate will become a driver in economics, affecting all aspects of the economy. He also divested in a separate letter (to investors) that BlackRock will be cutting ties with previous investments involving thermal coal and other investments that have a large environmental risk. Personal life Fink has been married to his wife, Lori, since the mid-1970s. The couple own homes in Manhattan; North Salem, New York;Miles Costello: Business big shot: Larry Fink,The Times, June 8, 2009 and Vail, Colorado. The couple have three children. Joshua, their eldest son, was CEO of Enso Capital, a now defunct hedge fund in which Fink had a stake. Fink is a lifelong supporter of the Democratic Party.  Public perception  In his 2018 annual letter to shareholders, Fink stated that other companies should be aware of their impact on society, however, anti-war organizations are discontent with Fink's statement, because his company, BlackRock, is the largest investor in weapon manufacturers through its U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF. In September 2018, an activist with the U.S. non-profit organization Code Pink confronted Fink on stage at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit.

In the Netherlands, this in general concerns a prefix used by the untitled nobility. In Belgium, this is the lowest title within the nobility system, recognised by the Court of Cassation.\\"Arresten van het Hof van Cassatie\\", 1927. It is the cognate and equivalent of the German noble honorific Junker, which was historically used throughout the German-speaking part of Europe, and to some extent also within Scandinavia. Honorific of nobility Jonkheer or jonkvrouw is literally translated as \\"young lord\\" or \\"young lady\\". In the Middle Ages, such a person was a young and unmarried child of a high-ranking knight or nobleman. Many noble families could not support all their sons to become a knight, because of the expensive equipment. So the eldest son of a knight was a young lord, while his brothers remained as esquires. However, in the Low Countries (and other parts of continental Europe), only the head of most noble families carries a title, inheritance being by male lineage. As a result, most of the nobility is untitled in the Netherlands. \\"Jonkheer\\", or its female equivalent \\"jonkvrouw\\", developed therefore quite early into a different but general meaning: an honorific to show that someone does belong to the nobility but does not possess a title. The abbreviation jhr. (for men) or jkvr. (for women) is placed in front of the name, preceding academic but not state titles. The honorific could be compared more or less with \\"Edler\\" in Austria or \\"Junker\\" in Germany, though due to circumstances of German and especially Prussian history, \\"Junker\\" assumed connotations of militarism absent from the Dutch equivalent. Ranking this with the English nobility, it is roughly comparable with \\"The Honourable\\" when the untitled person is a son or daughter of a baron, viscount, or the younger son of an earl; or \\"Lord\\" or \\"Lady\\" when the person belongs to the old untitled but high-ranking (Dutch) nobility from before 1815 (e.g. \\"Heer van X\\" or Lord of X). A female spouse of a jonkheer is not named jonkvrouw but \\"Mevrouw\\", translated into English as Madam and abbreviated as \\"Mrs.\\" (with the use of her husband's name). However, if she is a jonkvrouw in her own right, she can be styled as such (together with her maiden name), unless she chooses to use her husband's name. Title of nobility Jonkheer is, in Belgium, the lowest title and an official Dutch mark of status (not a title), as stated above, and is used as such, most notably by members of the Dutch royal family with the style Jonkheer van Amsberg. Often however a title of nobility may be claimed by a family whose members are officially recognised only as jonkheeren, the title not being acknowledged by the modern monarchy either because the family is registered as untitled nobility and may thus only use the honorific or predicate, or because the family has not requested official registration of the title, but possesses a grant of nobility which predates the founding of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. In Belgium, a number of families may bear the hereditary title of Jonkheer. Famous were Jonkvrouw Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz (Queen Mathilde of Belgium) and Delphine, Jonkvrouw Bo√´l. Coronet heraldic coronet of a jonkheer. The coronet of rank for the untitled nobility in the Netherlands and Belgium is the same as that for the rank of a hereditary knight, i.e. Ridder: a plain circlet of gold with eight golden points, each topped with a pearl; five of them are seen in a representation. Furthermore, the golden circlet of the heraldic coronet is surrounded with a pearl collar. Unrecognised titleholders use the same coronet of rank as hereditary knights, described above. Unrecognised titles cannot officially use a coronet of rank and thus use the coronet that they have been historically awarded, if any at all. Nickname Jonkheer's best-known use among English-speaking people is as the root of the name of the city of Yonkers, New York. The word was likely a nickname, as opposed to an honorific, associated with Adriaen van der Donck; a young Dutch lawmaker, pioneering politician and landowner in New Netherland. While his business ventures largely proved less than successful, the city of Yonkers takes its name from his steadfast work in the formation of the state of Manhattan itself. The word, in reference to Van der Donck, is variously spelled among modern scholars. In Thomas F. O'Donnell's introduction to a translation of van der Donck's A Description of the New Netherland, it is suggested that van der Donck was known as \\"The Joncker\\". Russell Shorto's The Island at the Center of the World has \\"jonker\\", while Edward Hagaman Hall's book on Philipse Manor Hall uses \\"youncker\\". \\"Jonker\\" (old Dutch spelling joncker) is another form of the word \\"jonkheer\\". Jonker Street (Jonkerstraat) in Malacca, Malaysia, which derives its name from Dutch, can be traced back to when the Dutch ruled Malacca from 1641 to 1798.

By 1897, the school, then known as Albert Pike High School, occupied the entire building and, with an enrollment of eighty students, was one of the largest schools in Shelby County. After World War I, the school was renamed White Station to honor Mr. Eppie White, who had donated three acres of land for the construction of a school building. The school served first through eighth grades during this time.White Station High School 2007-2008, [High Priority School Improvement Plan]. David Mansfield, Principal, Dan Ward, Superintendent, Memphis City Schools. pp. 18-19. After the White Station area was annexed to Memphis, the school became part of the Memphis City Schools during the 1950-1951 academic year. At that time, the Memphis City Board of Education foresaw the need for a separate junior and senior high school in the area to accommodate the growing population. Rush W. Siler, a mathematics teacher at East High School, was appointed as principal in 1951, and White Station began to develop a junior high. In August 1954, a high school building was completed, and the school began to develop a senior high school program. As such, White Station Middle School and White Station Elementary School were formed. At this point, White Station High School needed a distinctive identity as a full-fledged Memphis high school. The original White Station mascot was a bulldog and the school newspaper was The Bulldog Leash, with school colors of blue and white. However, these colors were already in use by Memphis Catholic High School. The first senior class of 1956-1957 chose Spartans as their mascot and green and gray as school colors. In keeping with the ancient Greek theme, the White Station newspaper was dubbed The Scroll and the yearbook became The Shield. The first high school class of seventy-eight seniors graduated on May 30, 1957. Future development The school began development on a new building in 2009, which is expected to be completed sometime in 2011, at which time an older building will be torn down. The Freshman Academy was completed in the summer of 2011 and the old South Annex was torn down in response. A new parking lot was created. As of 2014, a grant was received to update the cafeteria and the picnic tables in the courtyard. In November 2009, the school system in which White Station is included won a grant of $90 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The gift of more than $90 million from Gates is supposed to fund plans to improve teacher effectiveness, including raising the bar for tenure and paying $6,000 incentives for high- quality new teachers who stay at least four years. Due to political corruption and instability, however, very little of that grant has been seen by White Station or any other local schools.http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2009/nov/18/mcs-to-sign-pact-for- gates-90m/ Notable alumni * Kathy Bates, Academy Award-winning actress * Leron Black, basketball player * Dana Buchman, fashion designer * Paul Finebaum, sports media commentator * Cary Fowler, agriculturalist and former Executive Director of Global Crop Diversity Trust * Clare Grant, actress * Chris Chiozza, basketball player * Donald Gray, American football player * Joe Jackson, basketball player * David Kustoff, politician * Alan Lightman, theoretical physicist and novelist * Dillon Mitchell, American football player * Dolen Perkins-Valdez, novelist and professor * Dan Schneider, actor, writer, and producer * Andrew VanWyngarden, rock musician, MGMT * Doug Wamble, guitarist, vocalist, and composer * Cedrick Wilson Jr., American football player * Tay Keith, American record producer and songwriter References External links * White Station High School's website * White Station Baseball * White Station Spartan Football (American football) * White Station High School Spartan Soccer [https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high- schools/tennessee/districts/shelby-co/white-station-high-school-18108} Category:Public high schools in Tennessee Category:Schools in Memphis, Tennessee ","title":"White Station High School"},{"id":"2152617","text":"Flavius Hypatius (; died 532) was a Byzantine noble of Imperial descent who held the position of commander in the East during the reign of Justin I, and was chosen by the mob as emperor during the Nika riots in Constantinople against Justinian I and executed shortly thereafter.  Life  Hypatius was the nephew of Emperor Anastasius I, who ruled before Justin, and he was also associated by marriage to the noble Anicii clan, which gave him a serious claim to the imperial diadem; however, Hypatius showed no such ambition, and he and the other nephews of Anastasius were well-treated by both Justin and his successor to the Byzantine throne, Justinian I. In the height of the Nika riots, Hypatius, along with his brother Pompeius and Probus (another nephew of Anastasius), were among the prime candidates for the imperial throne. As it became clear that the mob wanted a new emperor, Probus fled the city and Hypatius and Pompeius took shelter in the Imperial Palace, along with Justinian and the rest of the Byzantine Senate. They did not wish to rebel against Justinian, fearing they would have too little popular support. Nevertheless, Justinian, fearing treachery, expelled the Senate from the Palace, thus ushering the two brothers into the mob's arms. Hypatius was dragged away from his house, despite the efforts of his wife to prevent this, and was proclaimed emperor by the rioting mob at the Hippodrome. Hypatius seems to have thereafter overcome his initial reluctance, and began to play up to the part of emperor. However, the riots were soon successfully (if bloodily) quelled by the Imperial Guard, and Hypatius was captured by Justinian's men. Justinian is reported to have wanted to spare Hypatius's life, but his wife Theodora prevailed upon him to see the punishment meted out, and the involuntary usurper was executed.

It is used worldwide in research and industry, in particular in automotive, combustion, and chemical processing applications. Problems to be solved by COSILAB may involve thousands of reactions amongst hundreds of species for practically any mixture composition, pressure and temperature. Its computational capabilities allow for a complex chemical reaction to be studied in detail, including intermediate compounds, trace compounds and pollutants. Whilst complex chemistry is accounted for, chemical reactor or combustion geometries that can be handled by COSILAB are relatively simple. For the purpose of \`\`real-life\\" simulations this limitation can be overcome, however, by using a library of pre-compiled subroutines and functions, that one can link to his or her own code written in Fortran, the C programming language or C++. In this way, it is possible to develop fully two-dimensional or three- dimensional CFD or computational fluid dynamics codes that are able to capture fairly realistic geometries.

It airs a classic Regional Mexican music format. KFWB is owned by Lotus Communications. The station has a colorful history, being the radio voice of Warner Bros. Studios in the early days of broadcasting, and a long-time Group W/CBS all-news radio station from 1968 to 2009. It has kept the same call sign throughout its nearly 100-year history. KFWB is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format. KFWB broadcasts with 5,000 watts of power from a non-directional antenna shared with KLAC on North Indiana Avenue near Lincoln Park in Eastside Los Angeles. The studios and offices are on Barham Boulevard, near the Universal City complex. History =The Warner Bros. years= On March 3, 1925, KFWB first signed on the air, initially on the frequency of 950 kHz. The station was started by Sam Warner, a co-founder of Warner Bros.. The station launched the careers of such stars as Ronald Reagan, Alan Ladd and Bing Crosby during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" The station was the first to broadcast the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena. Although some think its call letters stand for Keep Filming Warner Brothers or K Four Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner), the call sign was sequentially issued by the Department of Commerce, predecessor to the FCC. The station got its call sign just after KFWA in Ogden, Utah, and KFWC in San Bernardino, both granted in February 1925. A Chronology of AM Radio Broadcasting 1900-1960 Nevertheless, Warner Bros. Animation regularly used KFWB as a running gag in its productions. On February 8, 1937, KFWB opened a new facility on the south end of the Warner Bros. lot. It included six large studios, one of which was a 500-seat theater, and a \\"multi-manual pipe organ, built especially for broadcasting.\\" Bedtime for Sniffles, a 1940 Merrie Melodies cartoon, produced by Warner Bros., and directed by Chuck Jones, has Sniffles the mouse trying to stay awake for Santa Claus, and a radio announcer signs off for the night identifying the station as KFWB. Another cartoon of the same year, The Timid Toreador, co-directed by Bob Clampett, shows an announcer broadcasting on this station, although the action takes place in Mexico. The Merrie Melodies cartoon for I've Got A Torch Song released in conjunction with Gold Diggers of 1933 has KFWB written on the microphones in the scenes of the torch singers. In 1932, a KFWB personality, Al Jarvis, began playing recorded music, a rarity on radio at the time, where music was usually performed live. He called his show \\"The World's Largest Make Believe Ballroom.\\" In 1946, KFWB brought in two disc jockeys from New York City: Maurice Hart of WNEW, whose morning drive time show Start the Day Right was described as \\"Words and Music Straight from the Hart,\\" and Martin Block, who shortened Jarvis' title to \\"The Make-Believe Ballroom.\\" In those days, the DJs selected their own music, either from KFWB's extensive record library, or new songs brought to them by \\"song pluggers.\\" Old and new, vocal and instrumental were mixed together to the disc jockey's choice. In 1950, KFWB was sold to its long-time general manager, Harry Maizlish. It soon moved its studios off the Warner Bros. lot to join Maizlish's FM station, KFMV (now KTWV), on Hollywood Boulevard. =Playing rock & roll= In 1958, the original \\"Seven Swingin‚Äô Gentlemen\\" (a nickname for the DJ staff) turned KFWB into a rock & roll powerhouse in Los Angeles. Under new owners Crowell-Collier Broadcasting, program director Chuck Blore pioneered the Top 40 format on AM 980, calling it Channel 98 Color Radio. KFWB became one of the most listened- to stations in the Southland and a leader in the Top 40 format around the country. The air staff during the glory days included Roger Christian (songwriter), Bill Ballance, B. Mitchel Reed, Bruce Hayes, Al Jarvis, Joe Yocam, Elliot Field, Ted Quillin and Gene Weed. Hourly updates were delivered by a staff of respected newscasters, including Cleve Herrmann, Charles Arlington, John Babcock, Beach Rogers, Mike Henry, Hal Goodwin, Al Wiman, Bill Angel, J. Paul Huddleston and Jackson King. In the mid-1960s, KFWB was overtaken by rival KRLA. Then KRLA was put in second place by the launch of \\"Boss Radio\\" at KHJ, and this relegated KFWB to the position of the third- place Top 40 music station in the L.A. market. =All-news radio= In 1966, KFWB was purchased by Westinghouse Broadcasting. The previous year, Westinghouse had successfully launched an all-news radio format on WINS in New York City, after that station had been playing Top 40 music. On March 11, 1968, KFWB ended its Top 40 era, and was relaunched as an all-news radio station. The station promoted itself with the slogans \\"All news, all the time\\" and \\"You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world\\", as first used by WINS, although KFWB's format used a 30-minute news cycle. Like WINS and co-owned KYW Philadelphia, KFWB had a running Teletype sound effect in the background during regular newscasts. Also in Spring 1968, another Los Angeles radio station jumped into the all-news format, KNX, owned by CBS Radio. For the next 27 years, the two stations would be competitors, airing television commercials and sponsoring billboards, in an effort to be LA's top radio news outlet. In 1995, Westinghouse bought the CBS Corporation, merging the broadcast operations of the two companies, with KFWB coming under the ownership of CBS Radio. For the first several years after their parent companies merged, KFWB and KNX continued to operate separately, as friendly rivals. In addition to being an all-news station, KFWB also had sports play-by-play contracts. It previously aired Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games and many National Football League games from Westwood One. The NFL broadcasts stopped after the 2007 Pro Bowl, later switching to AM 790 KABC. With that, the slogan \\"all news, all the time\\" returned. However, in 2008, the NFL broadcasts returned for a brief period. Beginning in 2008, KNX and KFWB were jointly branded as \\"CBSNewsRadioLA.\\" The CBSNewsRadioLA brand was used for simulcasting special programs and for marketing to advertisers.http://worldfamouscbs.com/ In addition, there were no longer separate field reporters for KNX and KFWB. CBSNewsRadioLA reporters filed stories for both stations. Also in the 2009 season, KFWB began broadcasting some weekday baseball games of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, although the flagship station remained the Angels-owned KLAA.LA Radio News On August 13, 2009, CBS announced the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers had signed a multi-year broadcast rights pact, with KFWB carrying every Clippers contest. Over time, KFWB's ratings gradually dropped. A number of factors may have been involved. KFWB is powered at 5,000 watts, while KNX is powered at 50,000 watts. In its final months as an all-news station, KFWB added more news about the movie and television industries, since many people in the Los Angeles market are employed in those fields. But the ratings continued to fall. The station's last all-news broadcast concluded at 1:00am on September 8, 2009. Anchors Jan Stevens and Andi Marshall bid listeners farewell and thanked them for 41 years of support. =Moving to news/talk= Logo as \\"News/Talk 980\\" On September 8, 2009, the station adopted a news-talk format, limiting the all-news blocks to AM and PM drive times. The station added nationally syndicated shows, including Dave Ramsey, Laura Ingraham, Michael Smerconish and Dr. Laura Schlessinger (who moved from longtime flagship KFI).http://www.ocregister.com/articles/kfwb-news-laura-2523798-talk- ingraham In 2011, Dr. Laura's show was dropped when she moved from broadcast radio to Sirius XM Satellite Radio. Dave Ramsey shifted to 11am-2pm and the station added motivational speaker Les Brown to its afternoon lineup. Brown left the station in 2012. Ramsey's show was discontinued in 2014. By the summer of 2014, KFWB's weekday line-up included: LA's Morning News with Penny Griego and Phil Hulett; Money 101 with Bob McCormick; \\"As We See It\\" with Phil Hulett and friends; LA's Afternoon News with Maggie McKay and Michael Shappee; and The Amani & Eytan Show from NBC Sports Radio. In the early 2010s, the station was authorized by the FCC to boost its power to 50,000 watts, using a directional antenna involving multiple towers. But the power increase was short-lived. A few years later, new owners returned to KFWB's original 5,000 watt output, so the station could broadcast from a single non-directional antenna and take up less acreage of valuable Los Angeles real estate. On November 2, 2011, CBS Radio placed KFWB into a trust headed by Diane Sutter, under the name \\"The KFWB Asset Trust.\\" This was due to CBS Corp.'s ownership limitations after the network bought KCAL-TV in 2002.L.A.‚Äôs news/talk KFWB (980) goes into a trust, under new GM Valerie Blackburn - (released November 2, 2011) =Switch to sports= Logo as \\"The Beast 980\\" On September 22, 2014, KFWB became a CBS Sports Radio Network affiliate, cancelling all news blocks and general interest talk programs. The station began calling itself \\"The Beast 980.\\" The Beast 980 featured a live and local morning show, The Home Team, hosted by Bill Plaschke and Jeanne Zelasko. The Beast 980‚Äôs weekday lineup also featured Jim Rome and Fred Roggin. Sports updates were provided during the day mostly by Sam Farber, Amy Bender and Ted Sobel, with Hall-of- Fame USC Trojans broadcaster Pete Arbogast providing sports updates and as a fill-in host from time to time. The Beast 980 was the flagship radio station of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the LA Galaxy soccer team of the MLS. The Beast 980 also carried NFL games, NCAA college football games and NCAA basketball games. =South Asian programming= On January 5, 2016, it was reported that KFWB was in the process of being sold to an operator of foreign- language radio stations. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission stated that the station would be acquired by Principle Broadcasting, a company backed by Mercury Capital Partners, for $15 million. The final price in the contract filed with the FCC was $8 million. As a result of the sale, the station's sports format was discontinued on March 1, 2016. After one day of continuous airings of a five-minute retrospective of KFWB, the station began carrying the full service South Asian Bollywood music format which also was airing on KKDZ in Seattle and KLOK in San Jose.KFWB Los Angeles Sale Update - Radio insight (accessed January 7, 2016) KFWB called itself \\"Desi 980\\". On March 16, 2016, the Los Angeles Clippers entered into a multi-year deal making KLAC the team's new flagship station, removing the games from KFWB. =Classic regional Mexican= On October 4, 2016, Lotus Communications agreed to purchase KFWB from Universal Media Access for $11.2 million. The sale was finalized on March 7, 2017. Lotus owns 34 stations in California, Nevada and Arizona, including three in Southern California: Farsi-language KIRN in Simi Valley, ESPN Deportes affiliate KWKW in Los Angeles, and its simulcast partner, KTMZ in Pomona. On October 31, 2016, KFWB switched to a regional Mexican music format as \\"La Mera Mera 980\\" (\\"The Best of the Best\\"). In 2018, the station has been named the official radio station for calling MLS's Los Angeles FC matches. =Former on-air staff= Musicians * Irving Aaronson and his Commanders (circa 1929)Sies, Luther F.

Studios, which is now KTLA, at 5800 Sunset Boulevard. One of the two original towers still stands prominently out front. Due to RF interference getting into the movie studio's \\"talkies\\" sound equipment, the transmitter was moved in 1928 to the roof of the Warner Theater, now the Hollywood Pacific Theatre, at 6423 Hollywood Blvd. Eventually the studios were also moved to the Warner Theater. Those two towers are still standing. Years later, when KFWB was sold to KFWB Broadcasting Co. (Harry Maizlish), the studios moved to 6419 Hollywood Blvd. (now demolished), and the transmitter moved to a site near La Cienega and Rodeo Blvd., about three blocks south of the KECA/KABC studio/transmitter site. To make way for the construction of a FEDCO membership department store, in July 1958 the transmitter moved to its present location, diplexed with 570 KLAC in East LA. The studios moved in 1977 to 6230 Yucca St., also in Hollywood. In June 2005, KFWB moved into new studios on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district, sharing facilities with Entercom's other L.A. stations, KNX, KTWV and KRTH. Today, the studios and offices are on Barham Boulevard, near the Universal City complex. References Further reading *Herb Rosenblum. We'll Have More Music, Right After The News!

Early life Jerry Brudos was born in Webster, South Dakota as the younger of two sons. His mother had wanted a girl and was very displeased that she had another son instead. She would also constantly subject him to emotional and physical abuse. As a child, Brudos and his family would move into different homes in the Pacific Northwest, before settling in Salem, Oregon. Brudos had a fetish for women's shoes from the age of 5, after playing with stiletto heeled shoes at a local junkyard. He reportedly attempted to steal the shoes of his first grade teacher. Brudos also had a fetish for women's underwear and claimed that he would steal underwear from female neighbors as a child. He spent his teen years in and out of psychotherapy and psychiatric hospitals. In his teenaged years, Brudos began to stalk local women, knocking them down or choking them unconscious, and fleeing with their shoes. At age 17, he abducted and beat a young woman, threatening to stab her if she did not follow his sexual demands. Shortly after being arrested, he was taken to a psychiatric ward of Oregon State Hospital for nine months. There it was found Brudos's sexual fantasies revolved around his hatred towards his mother and women in general. He underwent a psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Despite being institutionalized, Brudos graduated from high school with his class in 1957. Shortly after graduation, he became an electronics technician. In 1961, Brudos married a 17-year-old girl, Darcie, with whom he would father two children, and settled in a Salem suburb. He asked his new bride to do housework naked except for a pair of high heels while he took pictures. It was at about this time that he began complaining of migraine headaches and \\"blackouts,\\" relieving his symptoms with night-prowling raids to steal shoes and lace undergarments. Brudos would experience a transgender period, where he used the female persona as a form of escape mechanism. Brudos kept the shoes, underwear, and (for a time) the bodies of his victims in a garage that he would not allow his wife to enter without first announcing her arrival on an intercom that he had set up. Murders and incarceration Between 1968 and 1969, Brudos bludgeoned and strangled four young women and attempted to attack two others: * Linda Slawson, 19, a door-to-door encyclopedia saleswoman who knocked on Brudos' door in January 1968. Brudos lured her to the basement while his mother and children were in the house, knocked her out with a wooden plank, and strangled her. He dressed her in different female undergarments and shoes he had stolen, arranged her body in provocative poses, and used a hacksaw to cut off her left foot, which he kept in a freezer and used to model his collection of high-heel shoes. He disposed of the body in the Willamette River. * Karen Sprinker, 18, abducted at gunpoint from a parking lot outside a department store in May 1968. Brudos was dressed in women's clothes during this attack. He brought her to his garage, made her try on his collection of undergarments and pose while he photographed her, raped her, and strangled her by hanging her by her neck from a pulley. Brudos had sex with the body on several occasions and cut off her breasts to make plastic molds. Afterward, he tied the body to a 6-cylinder car engine with nylon cord and threw it in the Willamette. * Jan Susan Whitney, 23, a motorist whose car broke down on Interstate 5 between Salem and Albany on November 26, 1968. Brudos offered to drive her to his home with the excuse of letting her call a tow truck there. While still in the car, he strangled her with a leather strap and raped her post-mortem. He kept the body hanging from the pulley in his garage for several days, during which he dressed, photographed, and had sex with it. This time, Brudos cut off one of her breasts and made a resin mold of it that he used as a paperweight. Afterward he tied the body to a piece of railroad iron and threw it in the Willamette along with Slawson's foot, which had rotted. * Sharon Wood, 24, attempted to abduct at gunpoint from the basement floor of a parking garage in Portland on April 21, 1969. * Gloria Gene Smith, 15, attempted to abduct on April 22, 1969. * Linda Salee, 22, abducted from a shopping mall parking lot on April 23, 1969. Brudos brought her to his garage where he raped and strangled her, and played with her corpse. He decided to not cut her breasts off because they were \\"too pink,\\" and instead drove an electrical current through the body in an attempt to make it \\"jump\\", which failed. Afterward, he tied the body to a car transmission with a nylon cord and threw it in the Willamette. Brudos would dress up in high heels and masturbate after committing a murder. In May 1969, a fisherman found the bodies of Salee and Sprinker in the Long Tom River. The police asked students at a nearby university campus about suspicious men and one led them to Brudos, who had phoned her several times to ask her for a date. Brudos gave police a false address, which increased their suspicions. At his garage, the police found copper wire that was determined to have been cut with the same tool that cut the cords used to tie the bodies. Brudos was arrested and he made a full confession. On June 28, 1969, Brudos pled guilty to three first-degree murders (Sprinker, Whitney and Salee) and was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life imprisonment in Oregon State Penitentiary. Though he confessed to Slawson's murder, Brudos was neither tried nor convicted for it because he did not make and keep photographs of the body, unlike in the other cases, but only of her foot. Whitney's body was found a month after Brudos' conviction, about a mile downstream from where he said he had thrown it. While incarcerated, Brudos had piles of women's shoe catalogues in his cell--he wrote to major companies asking for them--and claimed they were his substitute for pornography. He lodged countless appeals, including one in which he alleged that a photograph taken of him with one of his victim's corpses could not prove his guilt, because it was not the body of a person he was convicted of killing. In 1995, the parole board told Brudos that he would never be released. Illness and death Brudos died in prison on March 28, 2006 from liver cancer. At the time of his death, he was the longest incarcerated inmate in the Oregon Department of Corrections (a total of 37 years, from 1969 to 2006).

Cieslewicz (;Miss Pronouncer: Hear how to pronounce; The Wisconsin pronunciation guide for cities, counties, Indians & lawmakers) ; born February 17, 1959), commonly referred to as Mayor Dave during his term, is an American politician who was the mayor of Madison, Wisconsin from 2003 to 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Personal life and early career Cieslewicz was born and grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, and came to Madison as a student at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He is of Polish descent and was raised in what he identified as a Polish neighborhood. His wife is Dianne Cieslewicz, chief of staff to state Senator Fred Risser, and they reside in the Regent Street neighborhood on Madison's near-west side. Prior to seeking the mayor's office, Cieslewicz was executive director of \\"1000 Friends of Wisconsin\\", a land use advocacy organization that lobbied for Wisconsin's Smart Growth planning law. He was also a staffer in the Wisconsin State Legislature, a lobbyist for the Nature Conservancy, and an elected member of the Dane County Board of Supervisors. He lost a state Assembly race in 1992 to Tammy Baldwin, she later became a U.S. Senator. Election Cieslewicz replaced Susan J. M. Bauman as mayor of Madison in 2003, after defeating activist and former mayor Paul Soglin in a close contest. He was re- elected to a second four-year term in 2007, defeating Republican Ray Allen, a businessman. In 2011, Cieslewicz ran for a third term as mayor losing in a tight race to opponent, former Mayor Paul Soglin, whom he had defeated in 2003. Accomplishments in office * In conjunction with former Alderperson Brenda Konkel, the city enacted a mandatory inclusionary zoning ordinance, which required most new housing developments to provide 15% of their units at affordable prices to people of modest incomes in exchange for density bonuses and other incentives. The mayor announced in his April 2009 state of the city address that this initiative had been a failure.\\"Inside City Hall\\". The Capital Times. * A municipal minimum wage was enacted in March, 2004 with the leadership of Alder Austin King. Scaled to rise to $7.75 per hour by 2008 and thereafter to be indexed to inflation, Madison's wage ordinance made it the fourth city in the country with its own minimum standard. Madison's efforts prompted Milwaukee, La Crosse, and Eau Claire to establish their own municipal minimum wages. This resulted in a statewide compromise in May 2005, where Wisconsin's minimum wage rose to $6.50 per hour in exchange for prohibiting wage modifications at the municipal level. * Updates to city infrastructure were implemented, including new automated recycling and refuse collection programs, a merger of the city's civil rights departments, the creation of a comprehensive city planning process, and the creation of the city's first municipal swimming pool. * Cieslewicz supported an initiative that defeated the opening of a casino in Madison. * Cieslewicz and the city council implemented a citywide smoking ban, that prohibited smoking in any public space, including bars and taverns. The ban went into effect in July 2005. * He was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a goal of \\"making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets.\\" *Cieslewicz launched the New Cities Project, an organization of mayors and chiefs of staff dedicated to fostering progressive metropolitan leadership. Political activity In the 2004 presidential election, Cieslewicz endorsed John Edwards the week before the Wisconsin presidential primary. Edwards finished second, behind Sen. John Kerry. Cieslewicz endorsed Edwards again in the 2008 campaign. When Edwards withdrew from the race, Cieslewicz endorsed Barack Obama. =Criticism= Cieslewicz was criticized for firing city employees through budget reshuffling; he eliminated a job through budget cuts, but then created a similar job with a different title. Madison's bicycle-pedestrian safety coordinator, Arthur Ross was fired in this way, in a move supported by the Wisconsin Bicycle Federation. Cieslewicz became executive director of Wisconsin Bicycle Federation after his 2011 mayoral defeat. A gag rule used by Madison's Parks Department to limit employees' access to the press and to alders was compared to a practice used by Cieslewicz's own office. Former alderman Ken Golden accused Cieslewicz of being a bully towards his staff and city employees. In response to those critics, Cieslewicz unveiled in December 2004 a vision for economic development with support from the Chamber of Commerce, the Economic Development Commission, the Convention and Visitors Bureau, and other business organizations.

The station airs an Adult Top 40 radio format which the station describes as \\"Today's Modern Hit Music\\". KZZU-FM is owned by Morgan Murphy Media, with the license held by QueenB Radio. KZZU-FM has studios and offices with other Morgan Murphy stations on West Boone Avenue in Spokane.929ZZU.com/contact The transmitter is also in Spokane, off South Krell Ridge Lane, on Krell Hill, also known as \\"Tower Mountain.\\"Radio- Locator.com/KZZU Programming is also heard on translator station K223AN at 92.5 MHz in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.Radio-Locator.com/K223AN History =KREM- FM= In September 1955, the station signed on as KREM-FM, the first FM station in Spokane.Broadcasting Yearbook 1956 page 327 KREM-FM was co-owned with AM 970 KREM (now KTTO). KREM had been founded by Cole E. Wylie in 1946 and operated as a 250-watt station in Spokane. In a 1977 interview with radio broadcaster historian Richard Dunning, KREM was described as the \\"first non- network, independent, all music station\\" in Spokane. KREM had also put a television station on the air in 1954, a year before KREM-FM signed on. KREM- TV carried ABC and DuMont Television Network programming at first, but today is a CBS Network affiliate. In the 1950s and 60s, when few people owned FM radios, KREM-FM simulcast the AM station's programming. In 1958, KREM-AM-FM-TV were acquired by the Seattle-based King Broadcasting Company. Under King Broadcasting ownership, KREM-AM-FM became a Top 40 station, vying with KJRB for Spokane's young radio listeners. KREM-FM switched to a progressive rock format in the late 1960s, while the AM continued its Top 40 format. Around 1980, KREM-FM moved to a more structured album-oriented rock format, with a playlist of the top tracks from the best selling rock LPs. =Switch to KZZU= In 1984, the radio stations were sold to Highsmith Broadcasting, while King Broadcasting kept KREM-TV.Broadcasting Yearbook 1985 page B-291 At the time, different stations could not share the same call sign if they had different owners, with the AM becoming KLHT (due to its \\"light music\\" soft adult contemporary format), while the FM station became KZZU-FM. The station called itself \\"KZZU The Zoo\\" and \\"93 Zoo FM\\", spearheaded by Program Director Bill Stairs. The Top 40 format once heard on the AM station was switched to the FM station, complete with a \\"morning zoo\\". The \\"93 Zoo FM Breakfast Boys' Morning Show\\" (first hosted by Jim Arnold and Craig Johnson, then Arnold and Dave Sposito, then later with Sposito and Ken Hopkins) played the top hits and discussed pop culture. Popular KZZU DJs at the time included Jamie Patrick, Casey Christopher, Sean Rivers, Devin James, Steve Hawk, Paul Gray, Rachel Brooks, Doug Inman and Jeffrey Parker. =Rhythmic to Rock and the end of Zoo FM= Through the 1980s and 1990s, KZZU aired a mainstream top 40 format. As the 1990s went on, the format shifted toward a more rhythmic contemporary direction with a slight focus on Hip Hop artists from the inland Northwest. In the early 2000s, changing tastes towards rock music and increased competition caused KZZU to move more towards a rock-leaning Top 40 as hip hop music fell to the lower end of its playlist. In its last year as \\"93 Zoo FM\\", the station was noted in having an all-female DJ line up with the exception of Rick Dees and Hollywood Hamilton on Sundays. The rock leaning focus lead to some talk of a format adjustment. =From Zoo FM to ZZU= On October 17, 2005, KZZU dropped the \\"Zoo FM\\" moniker in favor of \\"92.9 ZZU\\", and shifted to Adult Top 40 in order to more effectively compete with KCDA. The new format left Spokane without a mainstream top 40 outlet for five years. The new format initially leaned alternative as KZZU removed all the hip hop from its playlist. Core artists included The Killers, Audioslave, Switchfoot and Green Day. Co-owned \\"Wired 96.9 KEZE\\" became Spokane's station for hip hop, R&B; and rhythmic pop and dance product. KZZU's new format reunited the Breakfast Boys with Molly Allen, although the station stopped using \\"The Breakfast Boys\\" moniker. Dave, Ken, Molly and producer Dan Roberts host the station's morning show, targeting an 18 to 49 year old demographic. =Adult Top 40= In 2008, after the change of sister station KEZE from Rhythmic Top 40 to Country, KZZU somewhat returned to its CHR roots by adding some rhythmic music during the evening hours while maintaining the Adult Top 40 format during the daytime. In 2011, KEZE dropped AAA (who adopted the format from KXLY-FM the year prior as part of a format swap) and returned to Rhythmic Contemporary music as \\"Hot 96.9.\\" The format flip on 96.9 resulted in KZZU dropping most rhythmic music to avoid overlapping with KEZE, though it would retain some rhythmic tracks. For a time, Mediabase and Nielsen BDS described KZZU as a Hot AC outlet. KZZU was reclassified as Adult Top 40 it when Mapleton Communications-owned KZBD dropped alternative rock for CHR, becoming \\"105.7 Now FM.\\" Notable Personalities *Molly Allen- morning radio personality with Dave Sposito and Ken Hopkins.

An important property is that an eavesdropper or man in the middle cannot obtain enough information to be able to brute force guess a password without further interactions with the parties for each (few) guesses. This means that strong security can be obtained using weak passwords. Types Password-authenticated key agreement generally encompasses methods such as: * Balanced password-authenticated key exchange * Augmented password-authenticated key exchange * Password- authenticated key retrieval * Multi-server methods * Multi-party methods In the most stringent password-only security models, there is no requirement for the user of the method to remember any secret or public data other than the password. Password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) is where two or more parties, based only on their knowledge of a password, establish a cryptographic key using an exchange of messages, such that an unauthorized party (one who controls the communication channel but does not possess the password) cannot participate in the method and is constrained as much as possible from brute force guessing the password. (The optimal case yields exactly one guess per run exchange.) Two forms of PAKE are Balanced and Augmented methods. Balanced PAKE allows parties that use the same password to negotiate and authenticate a shared key. Examples of these are: * Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) * PAK and PPK * SPEKE (Simple password exponential key exchange) * Elliptic Curve based Secure Remote Password protocol (EC-SRP or SRP5) There is a free Java card implementation.https://github.com/mobilesec/secure-channel-ec-srp-applet * Dragonfly ‚Äì IEEE Std 802.11-2012, RFC 5931, RFC 6617 * SPAKE1 and SPAKE2 * SESPAKE ‚Äì RFC 8133 * J-PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange by Juggling) ‚Äì ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2017), RFC 8236 * ITU-T Recommendation X.1035 Augmented PAKE is a variation applicable to client/server scenarios, in which the server does not store password-equivalent data. This means that an attacker that stole the server data still cannot masquerade as the client unless they first perform a brute force search for the password. Examples include: * AMP * Augmented-EKE * B-SPEKE * PAK-X *SRP (Secure Remote Password protocol) ‚Äì designed to be not encumbered by patents. *AugPAKE (RFC 6628) * OPAQUE * SPAKE2+ Password-authenticated key retrieval is a process in which a client obtains a static key in a password-based negotiation with a server that knows data associated with the password, such as the Ford and Kaliski methods. In the most stringent setting, one party uses only a password in conjunction with N (two or more) servers to retrieve a static key. This is completed in a way that protects the password (and key) even if N ‚àí 1 of the servers are completely compromised. Brief history The first successful password- authenticated key agreement methods were Encrypted Key Exchange methods described by Steven M. Bellovin and Michael Merritt in 1992. Although several of the first methods were flawed, the surviving and enhanced forms of EKE effectively amplify a shared password into a shared key, which can then be used for encryption and/or message authentication. The first provably-secure PAKE protocols were given in work by M. Bellare, D. Pointcheval, and P. Rogaway (Eurocrypt 2000) and V. Boyko, P. MacKenzie, and S. Patel (Eurocrypt 2000). These protocols were proven secure in the so-called random oracle model (or even stronger variants), and the first protocols proven secure under standard assumptions were those of O. Goldreich and Y. Lindell (Crypto 2001) which serves as a plausibility proof but is not efficient, and J. Katz, R. Ostrovsky, and M. Yung (Eurocrypt 2001) which is practical. The first password-authenticated key retrieval methods were described by Ford and Kaliski in 2000. A considerable number of alternative, secure PAKE protocols were given in work by M. Bellare, D. Pointcheval, and P. Rogaway,variations, and security proofs have been proposed in this growing class of password- authenticated key agreement methods. Current standards for these methods include IETF RFC 2945, RFC 5054, RFC 5931, RFC 5998, RFC 6124, RFC 6617, RFC 6628 and RFC 6631, IEEE Std 1363.2-2008, ITU-T X.1035 and ISO-IEC 11770-4:2006.

The day before, he had killed an innocent woman and man on Jacksonville‚Äôs Northside, he wounded two teenagers, and robbed a convenience store. The shooting at the GMAC office was the deadliest mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in Florida history, surpassing the murder of eight machine shop employees in Hialeah by Carl Robert Brown on August 20, 1982.Man kills self, 8 others at loan office, The Gainesville Sun (June 19, 1990) Early life Pough, who was born on February 16, 1948, in Jacksonville, Florida and was the first of nine children, grew up in an area near Florida Community College at Jacksonville. As a child, Pough suffered from asthma and he had a close relationship to his mother, whom he helped out a lot after his father left the family in 1959. He attended a vocational school, but dropped out in his sophomore year. At the age of 18, he began working as a common laborer, which he stayed as until his death. During the last year of his life, he was doing construction maintenance at a brewery. According to former schoolmates, Pough had affiliations with gangs during his time at school. He was arrested twice in 1965 for vagrancy, and twice again in 1966, once for attempted robbery and a second time for assault after he attacked a construction worker who owed him a quarter. In 1968, Pough was arrested for dangerously displaying a knife and was fined $75, and in July 1969, he was fined $10 after being charged for gambling. In 1970, he was arrested, but not prosecuted, for motor vehicle theft and vagrancy-prowling by auto. 1971 murder of David Lee Pender On May 8, 1971, Pough got into an argument with his best friend, David Lee Pender, who had called his girlfriend a \\"bitch\\". In the following scuffle, Pough grabbed a .38-caliber revolver from his girlfriend's purse and shot Pender three times; he eventually died in a hospital. According to relatives, he never managed to get over the fact that he had killed his friend. Pough was initially charged with murder, though the charge was later reduced to manslaughter. In the end, he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to five years probation, but the judgment of his guilt was withheld by the court subject to the successful completion of probation.Officials puzzled over Pough, The Gainesville Sun (June 24, 1990) Due to Pough's violent behavior in the past, it was also ruled that he should never be allowed to own a gun, though this was never forwarded to police. As a result, Pough was not considered a felon and therefore was able to purchase several handguns, among them the R√∂hm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver he later used to commit suicide, which was registered with the police on June 4, 1979. In 1977, Pough appeared twice in court for charges of bad debt, and there was also an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a 1982 employment compensation fraud case. Life prior to the shootings In December 1988, Pough traded his old car for a 1988 Pontiac Grand Am, though he soon had difficulties to make his payments. As a result, the car was voluntarily repossessed by GMAC in January 1990. He received a bill for $6,394 of outstanding fees in March, and again on April 6, which was the last contact between him and the office. About two months prior to the shootings, Pough purchased an M1 carbine at a local pawnshop. Pough, who was living in a rundown duplex in Jacksonville's Northwest Quadrant at the time, was known by his neighbors as a quiet and nice man who kept a regular and fixed schedule, but also as someone who would become angry fairly quickly and get engaged in enraged conversations, especially in matters concerning money and his car. Relatives described him as a recluse with no friends. After the death of his mother three years prior to the shootings, Pough was said to have emotionally changed for the worse, saying that he had nothing left to live for and arguing that he would \\"take someone with him when he leaves this world\\". Frequently, he had violent outbursts, which were directed against his wife, Theresa, and twice he threatened her by putting a gun to her head. In January 1990, they separated, as Mrs. Pough feared for her safety, and on March 2, she was granted an injunction that disallowed Pough to get in contact with her for a year. As a consequence, he withdrew even more and rarely socialized.Florida Gunman Kills 8 And Wounds 6 in Office, The New York Times (June 19, 1990)Hazy Records Helped Florida Gunman Buy Arms, The New York Times (June 20, 1990)911 tapes reveal workers' terror, The Gainesville Sun (June 20, 1990)Police still seek motive in massacre, The Gainesville Sun (June 21, 1990)Manselsberg, Rose G. (ed.): Mass Murderers: From the Files of True Detective Magazine; Pinnacle, 1993 (p. 163-180). The 1990 killing spree =First attacks= Pough started his killing spree in the night of June 17 at about 12:50 a.m. Armed with his M1 Carbine, which was wrapped in a blanket, he walked up to a group of men standing at a street corner in the northwest section of Jacksonville, not far from his home, and killed Louis Carl Bacon, with two shots in the chest before leaving. A couple of minutes later, he attacked Doretta Drake, who was chatting with two other women in a vacant parking lot just two blocks from the first crime scene. After hitting Drake with his car, throwing her on the sidewalk, Pough stepped out of his Buick and killed her with a single shot to the head, again from the M1, before driving away. A short time later, Pough also shot and wounded two youths, 17 and 18 years of age, after asking them for directions. Later, on the morning of June 18, Pough entered a convenience store, threatened the clerk with a pistol and, stating that he didn't have anything to lose, demanded all of the money in the register. After getting the money, he left. =GMAC shooting= After robbing the convenience store, he visited his mother's grave one last time, and then called his supervisor to state that he wouldn't be coming to work because he had something else to do. At about 10:44 a.m., Pough parked his car at the General Motors Acceptance Corporation office located at 7870 Baymeadows Way in Jacksonville.Florida Gunman Kills 8 And Wounds 6 in Office - New York Times. Nytimes.com (1990-06-19). Retrieved on 2013-09-04. He entered the building through the front door, armed with his M1 Carbine, a R√∂hm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver, several loaded magazines,VPC - Where'd They Get Their Guns? - GMAC office, Jacksonville, Florida and ammunition packed in his pockets. Then, without saying a word, he immediately began shooting with the M1 Carbine at two customers at the front counter, killing Julia Burgess and wounding David Hendrix with four shots. Walking through the open office, he then systematically moved from desk to desk and shot at the GMAC workers, deliberately aiming at those hiding under their desks. Drew Woods was the first to be shot at his desk, followed by Cynthia Perry and Barbara Holland nearby, as well as Phyllis Griggs, who was injured. When the GMAC employees realized what was going on, many of them escaped through a back door of the building, while Pough started shooting at those ducking for cover. GMAC employees Janice David, Sharon Hall, Jewell Belote, Lee Simonton, Denise Highfill, Ron Echevarria, and Nancy Dill were also shot. He then put the .38-caliber revolver to his head and committed suicide. In just about two minutes, Pough had fired at least 28 rounds from his carbine, hitting 11 of the 85 workers in the office, as well as the two customers. Six of his victims died at the scene, while another three died at hospital, the last being Jewell Belote, who succumbed to her wounds nine days after the shooting. When searching Pough's car, police recovered a loaded 9mm semi-automatic machine pistol, two magazines, and ammunition, as well as twelve pieces of nylon rope, each having a length of 24 inches, which led police to the assumption that Pough initially might have intended to take hostages. When police arrived at Pough's home, it had been ransacked, although they found a calendar with two dates circled in red: May 8, the day he killed his friend Pender, and June 18.

The state park is leased by private owners to the state of Michigan. History The woods are named for Edward Kirk Warren (1847-1919), the inventor of the featherbone corset (which replaced the whalebone corset with turkey bones and secured his fortune). Starting in 1879, Warren bought of the woods and of the dunes, setting them aside for preservation. Natural features The park is home to the last climax beech-maple forest in Michigan, which occupies . The virgin North American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) forest has specimens tall and with girths greater than in diameter. The remaining area in the park consists of floodplain oak-hickory forest. Because of the size and age of the trees, and the rarity of the ecosystem, the area has been designated since 1967 as a National Natural Landmark. Many of the beeches, with their smooth, thin, silver-grey bark, are heavily scarred by hand-carved graffiti, some of it decades old; however, the practice seems to have fallen out of favor in recent years. Activities and amenities The park has few facilities and is administered by nearby Warren Dunes State Park. Most visitors come to walk the of hiking trails, which run from the northern boundary on Warren Woods Road to a parking area accessed from the southern boundary on Elm Valley Road. In the middle of the park the trail crosses the Galien River on a pedestrian bridge, where there is an interpretive station. The park contains the Warren Woods Ecological Field Station owned and operated by the University of Chicago. Birders cite the park as a particularly good place to spot pileated woodpeckers. Other visitors come to picnic. The park is the subject of ecological studies because, in combination with the ecosystems preserved in nearby Warren Dunes State Park, it completes a progression of ecological seres.

The coup is usually performed by an individual or a small group usually from within the corporation in order to seize power. A Boardroom coup draws upon the ideas of a coup d'√©tat in the same way that a corrupt, dysfunctional or unpopular group is pushed out of power. Examples of boardroom coups =Paramount and DuMont= In 1940, Paramount Pictures took control of DuMont after failed attempts to work with other established companies in their field, including CBS, RCA and AT&T.; Preceding these failures Paramount decided to obtain stocks in another television company, DuMont. After their purchase Allen DuMont, the owner of DuMont television, began to see his powers within the company flagging as Paramount now owned a large proportion of his company. Paramount with its newfound power proceeded to appoint its own directors amongst DuMont's. The company established their coup by giving crucial financial positions to those they had hired, stopping DuMont from having any financial input into the company and effectively becoming their owners. =Anheuser‚ÄìBusch= After the death of his youngest daughter in a freak car accident late in 1974, aging Anheuser‚ÄìBusch CEO Gussie Busch, who had already become unusually wary of spending company money on new projects, was so consumed with grief as to be impossible to work with. In May 1975, his oldest son August Busch III put into action a plan he had been working on with executives close to him for several years, and persuaded the board to replace his father with him. Busch was allowed to retain some of his company perks and continue running the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team, which the company owned, but only if he represented his departure from the company leadership as voluntary. Only after his death in 1989 was it made public that it had not been. =Apple (1985)= In 1985 Steve Jobs was stripped of his title as Apple‚Äôs chief visionary after a boardroom meeting in which Apple's representatives sided with then-CEO Sculley. Despite the success of a new advertising campaign release in 1984, there was significant backlog of unsold stock, which was worth millions in revenue. Demand for the products dropped significantly between 1984 and 1985, leading to rising tensions between the CEO and Jobs. In an attempt to raise confidence in the company and his own ability, he launched a new computer, the Turbo Mac. His new piece of technology featured a multitude of different features from previous Mac models including a faster operating system, customised internal parts exclusively for the Turbo and the ability to store data from within. The project however was unsuccessful due to problems in the physical technology of the system. After this failure and no sign of improvement in profits at the corporation, a boardroom meeting was set up to decide Apple's and, unknowingly to him, Jobs's future as well. No concrete solutions were made and a few months later, in 1985, Jobs and Sculley had a showdown. Sculley ousted his rival, diminished his former title and forced Jobs to leave the company. =Apple (1997)= After Jobs's removal, Apple had been faltering in its market position once again and was being overtaken by the other technological powerhouses. Sculley, in an attempt to save the company, began a search for a buyer. A multitude of companies were offered the corporation, but none accepted. In 1996 Gil Amelio took over the helm at Apple, and with the bad publicity the corporation was receiving, Amelio struggled in reinstating any hope for the future. He was fighting a losing battle for Apple and was considered by many to be worsening its struggle for survival. In June 1997 a meeting was set up with senior board members of Apple. The executives intended to discuss, exactly as it was nearly 10 years earlier, the state of the company and of Amelio. However, this time a clear decision was reached and a couple of weeks later Woolard, a member of the Board of Directors, delivered the news to Amelio by telephone that he would no longer be the head of Apple. Jobs, who had been busy after his resignation with his new company NeXT Inc., was reinstated as interim CEO after Apple bought his business in 1996 and was formally restored to the board in July 1997, just days after Amelio was ousted. =General Motors= In 1990 Robert Stempel was appointed to CEO of General Motors, a company that he had worked for since 1962. He had started in their Oldsmobile Division and gradually climbed the various ranks of the company until he was given the position. An economic recession hit the globe in the late 1980s and into the early 1990s which significantly impacted on GM and the automotive industry in general. The pressure to keep the company profitable came upon Stempel. He, alongside the board of directors, looked for ways to cut costs in every division. Particularly, they looked to restructure the make-up of the company so that it would bear the brunt of the recession less forcefully than his rivals. However, in 1992 the board took action against Stempel. With a vote the managing directors, as well as external directors, fired him. They believed that he was not only responsible for the level of GM's losses, but they also accused him of doing little to return the company to the success they expected. =Rangers Football Club= In May 2013 an attempt was made to threaten the position of the club's chairman Malcolm Murray. The club had gone into liquidation a year before but after an agreement was reached and the club was re-purchased, their prospects began to improve and confidence amongst shareholders was raised. Despite a prosperous looking future, in May a group of these shareholders decided that they wanted Murray removed as well as other senior members of the board. Fans and investors alike were uncertain of the exact financial state of the club because little information had been released since their liquidation. Because of this, tensions rose between the board and shareholders, despite directors trying to assure investors that the club was financially secure. The shareholders, who owned 6.1% of the business then successfully managed to oust Murray of his position and employ Walter Smith - a previous manager of the club whom was appointed in his place. Attempt of a Boardroom coup =Blackberry= In 2012 an attempt was made by Robin Chan to completely overhaul Blackberry in an attempt to save them. Chan was not an employee of Blackberry, instead a technological entrepreneur who set up his own business, the XPD Media Inc group. After Blackberry's share prices plummeted to $16 in 2012 Chan began to plan a takeover over the company with a team of specialists in finance and technology. His aim was to save the fledgling company from having to be sold out or going bankrupt. He created a slideshow, which he named Project BBX to present to the board. Within the slides there were details of Blackberry's current losses in a number of graphs and how he envisaged, with his team, to turn the company around. Some of the changes included completely overhauling Blackberry's operating system and ensuring the phone's security system was the best available to buy. In the end the board's opposition to major changes coupled with his lack of funding due to the size of his project meant Chan was never able to succeed in Project BBX and his boardroom coup failed.

This order includes many familiar groups such as many clams that are valued for food and a number of freshwater bivalves. Since the 2000s, the taxonomy currently represented in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) classifies several taxa contained in the former Veneroida into other orders, such as the new Cardiida (for Cardioidea and Tellinoidea) and Carditida (cockles and their allies). Description Venerids are generally thick-valved, equal-valved and isomyarian (that is, their adductor muscles are of equal size). Three main hinge teeth are characteristic of the subclass Heterodonta, to which this order belongs. Many species are active rather than sessile. However, they tend to be filter feeders, feeding through paired siphons, with a characteristic folded gill structure adapted to that way of life. In 2002, Gonzalo Giribet and Ward Wheeler suggested that the orders Myoida and Veneroida were not monophyletic. They have since been widely reorganised.

Its boundaries are the Mississippi River to the north and east, Interstate 94 to the south, and Hiawatha Avenue and Interstate 35W to the west. It has a longstanding tradition of cultural diversity and settlement, with a robust arts tradition. Community Cedar- Riverside is one of the most diverse areas in Minneapolis-St. Paul. It is home to a number of the 100 or so different languages that are spoken in the Twin Cities. A vibrant neighborhood, it boasts many restaurants, caf√©s, bars, and venues for performance art and music. The Cedar-Riverside neighborhood is historically known for its immigrant population, beginning in the late 1940s post-World War II with immigrants from eastern Europe. With the arrival of many new Cambodian, Somali, and especially Latino immigrants, hospitals now also offer services in other languages to accommodate patients whose mother tongue is not English. Employers such as Amazon have worked with the community to provide jobs and reduce the unemployment rate from 20 percent (in year 2017). Amazon hired 1,500 workers from the Cedar-Riverside job center and initially provided busing for workers to commute to its Shakopee distribution center but cut this service in late 2017. The neighborhood is part of the University community, and is dominated by the West Bank campus of the University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus, which includes the Law School, Carlson School of Management, Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, and West Bank Arts Quarter. The East and West Bank of the U of M are connected by the Washington Avenue Bridge. The acquisition of a number of residential blocks by the University for expansion of the West Bank campus was controversial in the 1960s. The neighborhood is also home to Augsburg University, a private liberal arts college and St. Catherine University's Minneapolis campus. It is served by the Blue and Green light rail lines. It is the only neighborhood in the Twin Cities with two light rail stops. Two popular mixed-use bike/pedstrian paths, Hiawatha LRT Trail and Samatar Crossing, also connect the neighborhood to the downtown area and to neighborhoods further south. Demographics In the late 19th century, Cedar- Riverside had a sizable Scandinavian immigrant community, most of whose members labored in the Mississippi River's lumber and milling industries. It later evolved into a hub for intellectuals, hippies, radical activists, actors, musicians and artists during the 1960s and 70s. In keeping with its tradition of ethnic and cultural diversity, the neighborhood is today home to the largest immigrant community in the Twin Cities. Somalis are now the predominant minority group in the area, resulting in the neighborhood being nicknamed \\"Little Mogadishu.\\" According to U.S. Census data from the 2005 to 2010 periods, the neighborhood's race and ethnicity profile is as follows: 45.0% Black or African American, 37.1% White, 10.9% Asian or Pacific Islander, 3.4% Hispanic or Latino, 2.8% two or more races, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, and 0.2% other race. About 51.7% of residents are female and 48.3% are male. Most citizens are young (16.7% are younger than 18), with 18- to 24-year-olds and 25- to 34-year-olds, respectively, representing 41.0% and 15.4% of people in Cedar Riverside. The neighborhood's overall population has risen at a moderate but steady rate, from 6,368 in 1990 to 7,545 in 2000 to 8,094 in 2010. The median household income could not be tabulated for the 2005-2009 period due to large error margins. However, it was $18,543 in 1999. Crime Crime statistics released by the Minneapolis Police Department for all of its neighborhoods indicate that between January and May 2012, Cedar Riverside had 134 instances of vice, mainly consisting of various forms of theft. Only one homicide was reported over this period. The neighborhood's statistics were comparable to the citywide average, and were a fraction of those of the neighborhood with the highest reported number of incidents, Downtown West. Overall, according to police, crime peaked in the period between 2002 and 2006, and has steadily declined in the following 5 years. By 2011, instances of serious crime had dropped a reported 40%. History The neighborhood has been a port of entry for immigrants since Swedes, Germans, and Bohemians began arriving in large numbers during the late 19th century. Cedar Avenue became a hub of the Minneapolis Scandinavian community in the late 1800s. Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish were spoken in many of the businesses, and in the early days, stars of Swedish American vaudeville entertained at Dania Hall, Mozart Hall and The Southern Theater. Samuelson's Confectionery 1890 There was Samuelsen‚Äôs confectionery and soda shop, Hagen's appliance store, Moberg‚Äôs Norwegian deli, and a host of other Scandinavian- owned businesses. On Cedar Avenue was Dania Hall, where the Danish community would meet. An eclectic mix of Gothic and classical styles, the building included a dining hall and kitchen in the basement, commercial space on the first floor, offices for the Society of Dania plus billiard and reading rooms on the second floor. A theater/assembly hall on the third and fourth floors featured Scandinavian vaudeville acts and weekend dances. On the corner of Cedar and Washington, just before the Washington Ave Bridge, was the Breezy Point Tavern owned by Oscar Carlsen, a Norwegian immigrant from the turn of the 20th century. Oscar had come to Minnesota to work in the lumber camps and saved a stake to buy this tavern. Original buildings on the east side of Cedar Avenue; the vacant site of Dania Hall (right) Where men in the community once worked in small businesses, or as skilled tradesmen, and workers for the railroad, flour mills, and breweries, Cedar-Riverside declined as a core community in the 1920s due to the impact of Prohibition on the entertainment district. Into the 1940s, Cedar-Riverside remained heavily Scandinavian. Postwar immigrants from all over Eastern Europe then settled in the area. The junction of Washington Avenue, Cedar Avenue, and 19th Avenue was known as Seven Corners. The Cedar-Riverside area had been known as \\"Snoose Boulevard\\" (Snusgatan) because so many Scandinavians lived there.Seward Profile April 2005. The West Bank, with the locally infamous Seven Corners district, mouldered into a skid row scene in the 1950s. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the area became the center of the University-oriented counterculture and antiwar movement. It was home to local hippies, protesters, and other anti- establishment groups between the 1960s and early 1970s. During those days, the neighborhood was known as the \\"Haight-Ashbury of the Midwest.\\" Riverside Plaza and the Mixed Blood Theatre at sunset The West Bank was home to McCosh's secondhand book store, a center for Beat and Hippie left-leaning bookworms, and later Things, probably the first head shop in the Twin Cities, which sold counterculture curios, anti-war buttons and posters, incense and drug paraphernalia. Marijuana, hashish and LSD were readily available in the area after about 1967. A community of hippies ‚Äî and numerous students and hangers- on who emulated the hippie lifestyle (at least on weekends) ‚Äî lived in old rental houses in the area and congregated at coffeehouses, such as the Extempor√©, The Scholar and the Broken Drum, and at bars, such as the Triangle Bar, the Viking, Caesar's, The Mixers and the Music Bar. (The latter burned down the night Robert Kennedy was assassinated, and eventually was replaced by a \\"people's park\\"). The Triangle often featured performers and recording artists Dave Ray, Tony Glover and John Koerner, who had associated to some degree with Bob Dylan during his brief Minneapolis sojourn. In 1973, the Riverside Plaza apartment complex was opened. Designed by architect and Cedar- Riverside resident Ralph Rapson, the tall buildings with their signature colored panels are a Minneapolis landmark and were featured as the residence of Mary Richards in later seasons of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Dayton-Hudson corporation (later Target Corporation) was a consultant, then withdrew, for a proposed commercial development in the area in 1974https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/190292272/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20%22west%20acres%22&match;=1. Many of the businesses that were established during that time ‚Äî Martha's Antiques, the Whale Leather Shop, the Five Corners Saloon, Richter's Drug Store and Smith's Leather Shop ‚Äî eventually went out of business, gradually giving way to newer stores and shops. The Depth of Field also closed in the last half of 2019. The University of Minnesota Medical Center The neighborhood's past still has an influence in the present. Some of the businesses in the area harken back to an earlier time, like the worker- controlled punk hangout, Hard Times Caf√© and the now-closed North Country Food Co-Op. In fact, some of the businesses, specifically in the Seven Corners district, use the history to promote their own business, such as the \\"Legend of the Seven Switchmen.\\" Fairview Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital figured prominently in the neighborhood, being only a few blocks away. Fairview and St. Mary's, which merged in 1986, later merged with the University of Minnesota Hospitals, forming a major medical complex straddling the Mississippi River. The organization is now known as University of Minnesota Medical Center. Arts culture Acadia Cafe 2012 Cedar-Riverside is home to a thriving arts culture. There are many playhouses and theatre groups in the area, including the Mixed Blood Theatre Company, Theatre in the Round, and The Southern Theater. There is also a percolating music scene, with musicians frequenting venues like The Cedar Cultural Center, The Cabooze, The Red Sea, Part Wolf MPLS, Acadia Cafe, and Palmer's Bar. Additionally, the West Bank music scene is known as a catalyst for major musicians, such as Bonnie Raitt, Leo Kottke, Butch Thompson (Jazz Originals), Peter Ostroushko (Prairie Home Companion), Dave \\"Snaker\\" Ray (Koerner, Ray & Glover), Erik Anderson (The Wallets), Dakota Dave Hull, Sean Blackburn (Prairie Home Companion), Bill Hinkley (Minnesota Music Hall of Fame), Karen Mueller (Autoharp Hall of Fame), and, to a lesser extent, Bob Dylan. Many of these musicians also taught, performed and/or jammed at the West Bank School of Music. The Cedar Cultural Center, Extempore' Coffeehouse, Scholar Coffeehouse, New Riverside Cafe, Viking Bar, 400 Bar, 7 Corners, Whisky Junction, Cabooze and Cedarfest have likewise all been popular music venues in their time. Established in 1978, KFAI community radio has broadcast a mix of community talk radio and folk and avant-garde music from around the world from the Bailey building since 1991. The arts flavor of the area is enhanced by the presence of Augsburg University and the University of Minnesota's West Bank Arts Quarter, which is home to the University‚Äôs arts programs. Cedar Riverside also plays host to the annual Zombie Pub Crawl. In the 2005 the Minneapolis Zombie Pub Crawl began with about 100 participants.

It was located in the present day region of Banat, which was named after this province. The province was abolished in 1778 and the following year it was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.  Duality of name  In the official documents of the time and also in all of native languages of the region, the name of the province appears in two basic forms, first derived from the name of Temeswar (Timi»ôoara), second derived from the name of Temes region: in German - , Romanian - , Serbian - , , Hungarian - and Latin - .Sorin For≈£iu: Denumirea Banatului √Æn epoca modernƒÉ (sec. XVIII - XX): Banatus Timisvariensis vel Banatus Temesiensis?  History  :For the entire history of Banat region, please see that article. Before the Habsburg province was established, several other entities had existed in the Banat region, including: the Voivodeship of Glad (9th century),http://keptar.niif.hu/000500/000586/magyaro-honf-terkep_nagykep.jpg the Voivodeship of Ahtum (11th century),http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1000/index.html the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (11th - 16th century) and one of its frontier provinces the Banate of Severin (from 1233 to the 16th century),Dov Ronen, Anton Pelinka: The challenge of ethnic conflict, democracy and self-determination in Central Europe, Frank Cass & Co. Ltd., Great Britain, 1998, page 18 the Ottoman province named Eyalet of Teme≈üvar (1552‚Äì1716), and the Banate of Lugos and Karansebes province within the Principality of Transylvania (16th‚Äì17th century), which was under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire as a whole. Although after the Austro-Ottoman war (1683‚Äì1697) and before the treaty of Karlowitz (1699) most parts of Banat were temporarily controlled by the forces of Prince Eugene of Savoy; in consequence of the treaty, the Ottoman sovereignty was recognized over the region with the fort of Teme≈üvar. However, as a result of the Spanish Succession War and the R√°k√≥czi's War for Independence, the Habsburgs were inclined to direct their attention elsewhere within their country, and there was no attempt on their part to gain any territories from the Ottomans until 1710. In the Austro-Turkish War of 1716-18, Prince Eugene of Savoy conquered the Banat region from the Ottoman Empire, which was recognized by the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718). The Habsburg Monarchy then established a new military administrative region there under the name of Banat of Temeswar. The capital of the province became Temeswar. The province remained under military administration until 1751 when civil administration was introduced in northern parts of the region by Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. From 1718 to 1739, Banat of Temeswar included not only the Banat region, but also parts of present-day eastern Serbia along the southern bank of the Danube river. Following the Treaty of Belgrade (1739), areas along the southern bank of Danube returned under Ottoman control. In 1751, the southern parts of Banat were excluded from the province and the Banatian Military Frontier was established in that area. The Banat of Temeswar was abolished in 6 June 1778, and in 23 April 1779, it was incorporated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, while its former territory was divided into three counties: Toront√°l, Temes and Krass√≥-Sz√∂r√©ny. The southern part of the Banat region, which was part of the Banat of Temeswar until 1751, remained part of the Military Frontier (Banat Krajina) until 1873.  Population  The province was bound to repopulate after the Habsburg conquest because it had a low population density on the grounds that the territory sustained a lot of adversity from the previous wars. The population density was among the lowest in Europe; some researchers suggest that it was around 1 person / square kilometres. According to the first census conducted by the Habsburg military authorities, the population of Banat numbered about 20,000 inhabitants, mostly Serbs. The former Muslim population of Banat had left the area immediately before and during the Habsburg conquest. The low population density resulted in the territory being repopulated by German families coming from Austrian and southern German lands, Romanians coming from Wallachia and Transylvania, by Slovaks from the north, and by Serb refugees coming from the Ottoman Empire, while some Serbs arrived in the area from other parts of the Habsburg Monarchy. Colonization of various ethnic groups in the area lasted until the early 19th century. The government organized regimental districts which mostly had Serb population with special privileges in exchange for defending the borders. The area also lost its Hungarian population in the 16th century,K√°roly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisn√© Hodosi: Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minority on the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, page 140 but Hungarians were not allowed to returnK√°roly Kocsis, Eszter Kocsisn√© Hodosi, Ethnic Geography of the Hungarian Minority on the Carpathian Basin, Simon Publications LLC, 1998, pp 140 -141 until the 1740s, because the Habsburgs regarded them as \\"politically unreliable\\". Thus, Hungarians were almost totally absent from Banat in the first half of the 18th century. After the permission was given, Hungarian settlers arrived from different parts of the kingdom (mainly from Transdanubia, Csongr√°d county and the J√°sz and Kun districts). According to data from 1774, the population of the Banat of Temeswar was composed of:Miodrag Milin, Vekovima zajedno (Iz istorije srpsko- rumunskih odnosa), Temi≈°var, 1995. * Romanians = 220,000 * Serbs and Greeks = 100,000 * Germans = 53,000 * Hungarians and Bulgarians = 2,400 * Jews = 340 The first official census took part during the rule of Joseph II, from the late 18th century. This shows Romanian majority in the east, Serbian in the west, and numerous German population in the whole area.  Governors  Governors of Banat of Temeswar did not have the title of \\"ban\\".

He was a switch-hitter and threw right- handed. In a 13-season big league career, Jay posted a 99‚Äì91 win-loss record, with 999 strikeouts, and a 3.77 earned run average (ERA), in 1546.1 innings. In July 2008, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. Bonus Baby In addition to being the first Little League player to advance to the major leagues, Jay was one of the first \\"bonus baby\\" players in the major leagues. This resulted when he signed a significant contract ($20,000) with the Braves, which forced the Braves to keep Jay on their major league roster for two seasons because of the contract's amount. On September 20, 1953, at the age of 17, making his first career start (having pitched only one game in relief previous), he pitched a seven-inning complete game shutout (the game was shortened due to rain), but generally was unremarkable in his two years with the team. Following the end of his two years, he was sent to the minors to gain experience on a staff that already was loaded with Hall of Famer Warren Spahn, Bob Buhl and Lew Burdette. Jay went 7‚Äì5 with an ERA of 2.14 in 18 games for the Braves in his best season (1958), becoming the first pitcher (fourth player overall) to win the NL Player of the Month award in July (going 5-2 in 7 starts, posting an ERA of 1.39, and earning 46 SO in 58.1 IP) but a broken finger kept him out of the World Series.Joey Jay out of series due to broken finger Second Chance with Cincinnati The Braves traded Jay to the Cincinnati Reds after the 1960 season for infielder Roy McMillan. Braves General Manager at the time, John McHale, reportedly made the deal based on the feeling Carl Willey could do a better job for Milwaukee than Jay.Braves Get McMillan in three-way deal Jay took full advantage of the trade, as he became a key figure in the Reds' stunning revival in 1961. Jay won 21 games (the first pitcher to win 20 since Ewell Blackwell in 1947), tied for the league lead in wins and shutouts, and won his second NL Player of the Month award in May (winning all six starts including a 4 May one-hitter against the Phillies, a 2.72 ERA, and 38 SO in 51.2 IP) as the Reds surged to their first National League pennant since 1940. However, the Reds faced a powerful New York Yankees club which won 109 games and featured Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, as the Reds lost in five games. However, the lone Reds win occurred in Game 2, a 6-2 victory as Jay threw a complete-game four-hitter at Yankee Stadium, being Jay's single-game career highlight. On May 1, 1962, at the Polo Grounds, off New York Mets pitcher Sherman Jones, Jay hit a three-run HR (base runners were Wally Post and Leo C√°rdenas), in the 6th inning, for his first MLB home run. At Crosley Field, on May 28, 1962, Jay hit his only other career home run, off Houston Colt .45s pitcher Bobby Tiefenauer, in the 5th inning, a two-run blast (Don Zimmer was on base). Jay also won 21 games in 1962 as the Reds won 98 games to finish in third-place behind the Giants and Dodgers. Jay's heavy workload in 1961 and 1962 took a toll the following year where he struggled to a 7‚Äì18 record. Jay posted an (11-11) mark in 1964 as the Reds finished a single game behind the eventual World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals. He would finish his career by returning to the Braves for their initial season in Atlanta in 1966.

The market crashed in 2012 when the value of credits collapsed and thousands of projects were left with unclaimed credits. The struggle about what to do with the old credits sank the 2019 COP 25 in Madrid. The CDM, defined in Article 12 of the Protocol, was intended to meet two objectives: *(1) to assist parties not included in Annex I in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is to prevent dangerous climate change; and *(2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments (greenhouse gas (GHG) emission caps).Clifford Chance LLP (2013). \\"Clean Development Mechanism: CDM and the UNFCC\\" http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/CDM%26UNFCCCcorrected.pdf . Advocates for International Development. Retrieved 19 September 2013. \\"Annex I\\" parties are the countries listed in Annex I of the treaty, the industrialized countries. Non-Annex I parties are developing countries. The CDM addresses the second objective by allowing the Annex I countries to meet part of their emission reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol by buying Certified Emission Reduction units from CDM emission reduction projects in developing countries (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 14). Both the projects and the issue of CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these emission reductions are real and \\"additional.\\" The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The CDM allows industrialized countries to buy CERs and to invest in emission reductions where it is cheapest globally (Grubb, 2003, p. 159). Between 2001, which was the first year CDM projects could be registered and 7 September 2012, the CDM issued 1 billion Certified Emission Reduction units. As of 1 June 2013, 57% of all CERs had been issued for projects based on destroying either HFC-23 (38%) or N2O (19%). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) was included in the CDM carbon offsetting scheme in December 2011. However, a number of weaknesses of the CDM have been identified (World Bank, 2010, p. 265-267). Several of these issues were addressed by the new Program of Activities (PoA), which moves to approving 'bundles' of projects instead of accrediting each project individually. In 2012, the report Climate Change, Carbon Markets and the CDM: A Call to Action said governments urgently needed to address the future of the CDM. It suggested the CDM was in danger of collapse because of the low price of carbon and the failure of governments to guarantee its existence into the future. Writing on the website of the Climate & Development Knowledge Network, Yolanda Kakabadse, a member of the investigating panel for the report and founder of Fundaci√≥n Futuro Latinamericano, said a strong CDM is needed to support the political consensus essential for future climate progress. \\"Therefore we must do everything in our hands to keep it working,\\" she said. History The clean development mechanism is one of the \\"flexibility mechanisms\\" defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility mechanisms were designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction commitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007). The flexibility mechanisms were introduced into the Kyoto Protocol by the US government. Developing countries were highly skeptical and fiercely opposed to the flexibility mechanisms (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 6). However, the international negotiations over the follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that the mechanisms will continue. Purpose The purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the \\"non-Annex I\\" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The CDM is one of the Protocol's \\"project-based\\" mechanisms, in that the CDM is designed to promote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction \\"production\\" (Toth et al., 2001, p. 660). These reductions are \\"produced\\" and then subtracted against a hypothetical \\"baseline\\" of emissions. The baseline emissions are the emissions that are predicted to occur in the absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are \\"credited\\" against this baseline, in the sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts. The economic basis for including developing countries in efforts to reduce emissions is that emission cuts are thought to be less expensive in developing countries than developed countries (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p. 30; Grubb, 2003, p. 159). For example, in developing countries, environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in developed countries (Sathaye et al., 2001, p. 387-389). Thus, it is widely thought that there is greater potential for developing countries to reduce their emissions than developed countries. Emissions from developing countries are projected to increase substantially over this century (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p. 29). Infrastructure decisions made in developing countries could therefore have a very large influence on future efforts to limit total global emissions (Fisher et al., 2007). The CDM is designed to start developing countries off on a path towards less pollution, with industrialised (Annex B) countries paying for the reductions. There were two main concerns about the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, pp. 14‚Äì15). One was over the additionality of emission reductions produced by the CDM (see the section on additionality). The other was whether it would allow rich, northern countries, and in particular, companies, to impose projects that were contrary to the development interests of host countries. To alleviate this concern, the CDM requires host countries to confirm that CDM projects contribute to their own sustainable development. International rules also prohibit credits for some kinds of activities, notably nuclear power and avoided deforestation. To prevent industrialised countries from making unlimited use of CDM, the framework has a provision that use of CDM be ‚Äòsupplemental‚Äô to domestic actions to reduce emissions. This wording has led to a wide range of interpretations - the Netherlands for example aims to achieve half of its required emission reductions (from a BAU baseline) by CDM. It treats Dutch companies' purchases of European Union Emission Trading Scheme allowances from companies in other countries as part of its domestic actions. The CDM gained momentum in 2005 after the Kyoto Protocol took effect. Before the Protocol entered into force, investors considered this a key risk factor. The initial years of operation yielded fewer CDM credits than supporters had hoped for, as parties did not provide sufficient funding to the EB, which left it understaffed. The Adaptation Fund was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol. The Fund is to be financed with a share of proceeds from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities and receive funds from other sources. CDM project process =Outline= An industrialised country that wishes to get credits from a CDM project must obtain the consent of the developing country hosting the project and their agreement that the project will contribute to sustainable development. Then, using methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (EB), the applicant industrialised country must make the case that the carbon project would not have happened anyway (establishing additionality), and must establish a baseline estimating the future emissions in absence of the registered project. The case is then validated by a third party agency, called a Designated Operational Entity (DOE), to ensure the project results in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. The EB then decides whether or not to register (approve) the project. If a project is registered and implemented, the EB issues credits, called Certified Emission Reductions (CERs, commonly known as carbon credits, where each unit is equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of CO2e, e.g. CO2 or its equivalent), to project participants based on the monitored difference between the baseline and the actual emissions, verified by the DOE. =Additionality= To avoid giving credits to projects that would have happened anyway (\\"freeriders\\"), specified rules ensure the additionality of the proposed project, that is, ensure the project reduces emissions more than would have occurred in the absence of the intervention created by the CDM. At present, the CDM Executive Board deems a project additional if its proponents can document that realistic alternative scenarios to the proposed project would be more economically attractive or that the project faces barriers that CDM helps it overcome. Current Guidance from the EB is available at the UNFCCC website. =Baseline= The determination of additionality and the calculation of emission reductions depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. Accordingly, the CDM process requires an established baseline or comparative emission estimate. The construction of a project baseline often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners involved in the project could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits. Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem. =Methodologies= Any proposed CDM project has to use an approved baseline and monitoring methodology to be validated, approved and registered. Baseline Methodology will set steps to determine the baseline within certain applicability conditions whilst monitoring methodology will set specific steps to determine monitoring parameters, quality assurance, equipment to be used, in order to obtain data to calculate the emission reductions. Those approved methodologies are all coded: AM - Approved Methodology ACM - Approved Consolidated Methodology AMS - Approved Methodology for Small Scale Projects ARAM - Aforestation and Reforestation Approved Methodologies All baseline methodologies approved by Executive Board are publicly available along with relevant guidance on the UNFCCC CDM website. If a DOE determines that a proposed project activity intends to use a new baseline methodology, it shall, prior to the submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology to the EB for review, i.e. consideration and approval, if appropriate.Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (May, 2011) CDM in Charts Version 13.1, p. 23 Economics According to Burniaux et al., 2009, p. 37, crediting mechanisms like the CDM could play three important roles in climate change mitigation : *Improve the cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation policies in developed countries *Help to reduce \\"leakage\\" (carbon leakage) of emissions from developed to developing countries. Leakage is where mitigation actions in one country or economic sector result in another country's or sector's emissions increasing, e.g., through relocation of polluting industries from Annex I to non-Annex I countries (Barker et al., 2007). *Boost transfers of clean, less polluting technologies to developing countries. According to Burniaux et al. (2009, p. 37), the cost-saving potential of a well-functioning crediting mechanism appears to be very large. Compared to baseline costs (i.e., costs where emission reductions only take place in Annex I countries), if the cap on offset use was set at 20%, one estimate suggests mitigation costs could be halved. This cost saving, however, should be viewed as an upper bound: it assumes no transaction costs and no uncertainty on the delivery of emission savings. Annex I countries who stand to gain most from crediting include Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In this economic model, non-Annex I countries enjoy a slight income gain from exploiting low cost emission reductions. Actual transaction cost in the CDM are rather high, which is problematic for smaller projects.World Bank, 2010, States and Trend of the Carbon Market. This issue is addressed by the Program of Activities (PoA) modality. =Difficulties with the CDM= Carbon leakage In theory, leakage may be reduced by crediting mechanisms (Burniaux et al., 2009, p. 38). In practice, the amount of leakage partly depends on the definition of the baseline against which credits are granted. The current CDM approach already incorporates some leakage. Thus, reductions in leakage due to the CDM may, in fact, be small or even non-existent. Additionality, transaction costs and bottlenecks In order to maintain the environmental effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol, emission savings from the CDM must be additional (World Bank, 2010, p. 265). Without additionality, the CDM amounts to an income transfer to non- Annex I countries (Burniaux et al., 2009, p. 40). Additionality is, however, difficult to prove, the subject of vigorous debate. Burniaux et al. (2009) commented on the large transaction costs of establishing additionality. Assessing additionality has created delays (bottlenecks) in approving CDM projects. According to the World Bank (2010), there are significant constraints to the continued growth of the CDM to support mitigation in developing countries. Incentives The CDM rewards emissions reductions, but does not penalize emission increases (Burniaux et al., 2009, p. 41). It therefore comes close to being an emissions reduction subsidy. This can create a perverse incentive for firms to raise their emissions in the short-term, with the aim of getting credits for reducing emissions in the long-term. Another difficulty is that the CDM might reduce the incentive for non-Annex I countries to cap their emissions. This is because most developing countries benefit more from a well-functioning crediting mechanism than from a world emissions trading scheme (ETS), where their emissions are capped. This is true except in cases where the allocation of emissions rights (i.e., the amount of emissions that each country is allowed to emit) in the ETS is particularly favourable to developing countries. Local resistance While the C in CDM stands for Clean, most projects might be better defined with the B from Big, from large hydropower to HFC or waste to energy and clean coal projects (which all together make the majority of credits generated through CDM). The argument in favor of the CDM is that it brings development to the South. However, in all continents the mainly Big Development it stands for is resisted by local people in those countries. A global coalition of researchers published a large report on African civil society resistance to CDM projects all over the continent.18th of April 2012 In New Delhi, India, a grassroots movement of wastepickers is resisting another CDM project on what the makers call 'the waste war' in Delhi. In Panama, a CDM project is blocking peace talks between the Panamanian government and the indigenous Ng√∂be-Bugl√© people. Civil society groups and researchers in both North and South have complained for years that most CDM projects benefit big industries, while doing harm to excluded people. As local protests against CDM projects are arising on every continent, the notion that CDM 'brings development to the South' is contested. Market deflation Most of the demand for CERs from the CDM comes from the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, which is the largest carbon market. In July 2012, the market price for CERs fell to new record low of ‚Ç¨2.67 a tonne, a drop in price of about 70% in a year. Analysts attributed the low CER price to lower prices for European Union emissions allowances, oversupply of EU emissions allowances and the slowing European economy. In September 2012, The Economist described the CDM as a \\"complete disaster in the making\\" and \\"in need of a radical overhaul\\". Carbon prices, including prices for CERs, had collapsed from $20 a tonne in August 2008 to below $5 in response to the Eurozone debt crisis reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. The Guardian reported that the CDM has \\"essentially collapsed\\", due to the prolonged downward trend in the price of CERs, which had been traded for as much as $20 (¬£12.50) a tonne before the global financial crisis to less than $3. With such low CER prices, potential projects were not commercially viable. In October 2012, CER prices fell to a new low of 1.36 euros a metric tonne on the London ICE Futures Europe exchange. In October 2012 Thomson Reuters Point Carbon calculated that the oversupply of units from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation would be 1,400 million units for the period up to 2020 and Point Carbon predicted that Certified Emission Reduction (CER) prices would to drop from ‚Ç¨2 to 50 cents. On 12 December 2012 CER prices reached another record low of 31 cents. Bloomberg reported that Certified Emission Reduction prices had declined by 92 percent to 39 each cents in the 2012 year. Financial issues With costs of emission reduction typically much lower in developing countries than in industrialised countries, industrialised countries can comply with their emission reduction targets at much lower cost by receiving credits for emissions reduced in developing countries as long as administration costs are low. The IPCC has projected GDP losses for OECD Europe with full use of CDM and Joint Implementation to between 0.13% and 0.81% of GDP versus 0.31% to 1.50%Climate Change 2001 - Synthesis report. Figure SPM-8, IPCC, 2001 with only domestic action. While there would always be some cheap domestic emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of ‚Ç¨40-50 per tonne CO2 equivalent. Certified Emission Reductions from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between ‚Ç¨5 and ‚Ç¨20 per tonne CO2 equivalent. The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the counterparty is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies. =Mitigation finance= The revenues of the CDM constitutes the largest source of mitigation finance to developing countries to date (World Bank, 2010, p. 261-262). Over the 2001 to 2012 period, CDM projects could raise $18 billion ($15 billion to $24 billion) in direct carbon revenues for developing countries. Actual revenues will depend on the price of carbon. It is estimated that some $95 billion in clean energy investment benefitted from the CDM over the 2002-08 period. =Adaptation finance= The CDM is the main source of income for the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund, which was established in 2007 to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (World Bank, 2010, p. 262-263). The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300 million and $600 million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price. CDM projects Certified emission reduction units (CERs) by country October 2012 Since 2000, the CDM has allowed crediting of project-based emission reductions in developing countries (Gupta et al., 2007). By 1 January 2005, projects submitted to the CDM amounted to less than 100 MtCO2e of projected savings by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 18-19). The EU ETS started in January 2005, and the following month saw the Kyoto Protocol enter into force. The EU ETS allowed firms to comply with their commitments by buying offset credits, and thus created a perceived value to projects. The Kyoto Protocol set the CDM on a firm legal footing. By the end of 2008, over 4,000 CDM projects had been submitted for validation, and of those, over 1,000 were registered by the CDM Executive Board, and were therefore entitled to be issued CERs (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 19). In 2010, the World Bank estimated that in 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs would be from China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%) (World Bank, 2010, p. 262). CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean would make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%). By 14 September 2012, 4626 projects had been registered by the CDM Executive Board as CDM projects. These projects are expected to result in the issue of 648,232,798 certified emissions reductions. By 14 September 2012, the CDM Board had issued 1 billion CERs, 60% of which originated from projects in China. India, the Republic of Korea, and Brazil were issued with 15%, 9% and 7% of the total CERs. The Himachal Pradesh Reforestation Project is claimed to be the world's largest CDM.UN-aided project in Himachal to cut down carbon emissions. Times of India (Jun 26 2011) = Transportation = There are currently 29 transportation projects registered, the last was registered on February 26, 2013 and is hosted in China. = Destruction of HFC-23 = Some CDM projects remove or destroy industrial gases, such as hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from the production of the refrigerant gas chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22). The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units. In 2009, the Carbon Trust estimated that industrial gas projects such as those limiting HFC-23 emissions, would contribute about 20% of the CERs issued by the CDM in 2012. The Carbon Trust expressed the concern that projects for destroying HFC-23 were so profitable that coolant manufacturers could be building new factories to produce the coolant gas. (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 60). In September 2010, Sandbag estimated that in 2009 59% of the CERs used as offsets in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme originated from HFC-23 projects. An example is the Plascon, Plasma arc plant that was installed by Quimob√°sicos S.A. de C.V in Monterrey, Mexico to eliminate of HCFC-23, a byproduct of the production of R-22 refrigerant gas. From 2005 to June 2012, 19 manufacturers of refrigerants (11 in China, 5 in India, and one each in Argentina, Mexico and South Korea), were issued with 46% of all the certified emissions reduction units from the CDM. David Hanrahan, the technical director of IDEAcarbon believes each plant would probably have earned an average of $20 million to $40 million a year from the CDM. The payments also incentivise the increased production of the ozone-depleting refrigerant HCFC-22, and discourage substitution of HCFC-22 with less harmful refrigerants. In 2007 the CDM stopped accepting new refrigerant manufacturers into the CDM. In 2011, the CDM renewed contracts with the nineteen manufacturers on the condition that claims for HFC-23 destruction would be limited to 1 percent of their coolant production. However, in 2012, 18 percent of all CERs issued are expected to go to the 19 coolant plants, compared with 12 percent to 2,372 wind power plants and 0.2 percent to 312 solar projects. In January 2011, the European Union Climate Change Committee banned the use of HFC-23 CERs in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme from 1 May 2013. The ban includes nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity, the under-mining of the Montreal Protocol, costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced developing countries getting too many CERs. From 23 December 2011, CERs from HFC-23 and N2O destruction projects were banned from use in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme, unless they had been purchased under future delivery contracts entered into prior to 23 December 2011. The use of the future delivery contracts ends in June 2013. As of 1 June 2013, the CDM had issued 505,125 CERs, or 38% of all CERs issued, to 23 HFC-23 destruction projects. A further 19% (or 255,666 CERs) had been issued to 108 N2O destruction projects. Barriers World Bank (n.d., p. 12) described a number of barriers to the use of the CDM in least developed countries (LDCs). LDCs have experienced lower participation in the CDM to date. Four CDM decisions were highlighted as having a disproportionate negative impact on LDCs: *Suppressed demand: Baseline calculations for LDCs are low, meaning that projects cannot generate sufficient carbon finance to have an impact. *Treatment of projects that replace non-renewable biomass: A decision taken led to essentially a halving in the emission reduction potential of these projects. This has particularly affected Sub-Saharan Africa and projects in poor communities, where firewood, often from non-renewable sources, is frequently used as a fuel for cooking and heating. *Treatment of forestry projects and exclusion of agriculture under the CDM: These sectors are more important for LDCs than for middle-income countries. Credits from forestry projects are penalized under the CDM, leading to depressed demand and price. *Transaction costs and CDM process requirements: These are geared more towards the most advanced developing countries, and do not work well for the projects most often found in LDCs. Views on the CDM =Additionality= Emissions One of the difficulties of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 54-56). The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and N2O. Some low- carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal- powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their additionality assessments. They compared establishing additionality to the balance of evidence in a legal system. Certainty in additionality is rare, and the higher the proof of additionality, the greater the risk of rejecting good projects to reduce emissions. A 2016 study by the √ñko-Institut estimated that only 2% of the studied CDM projects had a high likelihood of ensuring that emission reductions are additional and are not over-estimated. Types Additionality is much contested. There are many rival interpretations of additionality: # What is often labelled ‚Äòenvironmental additionality‚Äô has that a project is additional if the emissions from the project are lower than the baseline. It generally looks at what would have happened without the project. # Another interpretation, sometimes termed ‚Äòproject additionality‚Äô, the project must not have happened without the CDM. A number of terms for different kinds of additionality have been discussed, leading to some confusion, particularly over the terms 'financial additionality' and 'investment additionality' which are sometimes used as synonyms. 'Investment additionality', however, was a concept discussed and ultimately rejected during negotiation of the Marrakech Accords. Investment additionality carried the idea that any project that surpasses a certain risk-adjusted profitability threshold would automatically be deemed non-additional. 'Financial additionality' is often defined as an economically non-viable project becoming viable as a direct result of CDM revenues. Many investors argue that the environmental additionality interpretation would make the CDM simpler. Environmental NGOs have argued that this interpretation would open the CDM to free-riders, permitting developed countries to emit more CO2e, while failing to produce emission reductions in the CDM host countries.Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM; International Rivers; December 2, 2007 Gillenwater (2011) evaluated the various definitions of additionality used within the CDM community and provided a synthesis definition that rejects the notion of there being different types of additionality. Schneider (2007) produced a report on the CDM for the WWF. The findings of the report were based on a systematic evaluation of 93 randomly chosen registered CDM projects, as well as interviews and a literature survey (p. 5). According to Schneider (2007, p. 72), the additionality of a significant number of projects over the 2004-2007 period seemed to be either unlikely or questionable. It is never possible to establish with certainty what would have happened without the CDM or in absence of a particular project, which is one common objection to the CDM. Nevertheless, official guidelines have been designed to facilitate uniform assessment,Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 03), UNFCCC CDM EB, EB 29 set by the CDM Executive Board for assessing additionality. Views on additionality An argument against additionality is based on the fact that developing countries are not subject to emission caps in the Kyoto Protocol (M√ºller, 2009, pp. iv, 9-10). On these basis, \\"business-as-usual\\" (BAU) emissions (i.e., emissions that would occur without any efforts to reduce them) in developing countries should be allowed. By setting a BAU baseline, this can be interpreted as being a target for developing countries. Thus, it is, in effect, a restriction on their right to emit without a cap. This can be used as an argument against having additionality, in the sense that non- additional (i.e., emission reductions that would have taken place under BAU) emission reductions should be credited. M√ºller (2009) argued that compromise was necessary between having additionality and not having it. In his view, additionality should sometimes be used, but other times, it shouldn't. According to World Bank (n.d., pp. 16‚Äì17), additionality is crucial in maintaining the environmental integrity of the carbon market. To maintain this integrity, it was suggested that projects meeting or exceeding ambitious policy objectives or technical standards could be deemed additional. =Concerns= Overall efficiency Pioneering research has suggested that an average of approximately 30% of the money spent on the open market buying CDM credits goes directly to project operating and capital expenditure costs. Other significant costs include the broker's premium (about 30%, understood to represent the risk of a project not delivering) and the project shareholders' dividend (another 30%). The researchers noted that the sample of projects studied was small, the range of figures was wide and that their methodology of estimating values slightly overstated the average broker's premium. The risk of fraud One of the main problems concerning CDM- projects is the risk of fraud. The most common practices are covering up the fact that the projects are financially viable by themselves and that the emission reductions acquired through the CDM-project aren‚Äôt additional. Exaggerating the carbon benefits is also a common practice, just as carbon leakage. Sometimes a company even produces more to receive more CERs. Most of the doubtful projects are Industrial gas projects. Even though only 1.7% of all CDM-projects can be qualified as such, extraordinarily they account for half to 69% of all CERs that have been issued, contributing to a collapse in the global market for all CERs. Since the cost of dismantling these gases is very low compared to the market price of the CERs, very large profits can be made by companies setting up these projects. In this way, the CDM has become a stimulus for carbon leakage, or even to simply produce more. Hydro-projects are also quite problematic. Barbara Haye calculated that more than a third of all hydro-projects recognized as a CDM-project ‚Äòwere already completed at the time of registration and almost all were already under construction‚Äô, which means that CERs are issued for projects that aren‚Äôt additional, which again indirectly leads to higher emissions. Moreover, most of the proposed carbon benefits of these projects are exaggerated. Why are these projects approved by the Clean_Development_Mechanism Executive Board (EB)?‚Äô, one might wonder. One of the main problems is that the EB is a highly politicized body. People taking a place in the board aren‚Äôt independent technocrats, but are elected as representatives of their respective countries. They face pressure from their own & other (powerful) countries, the World Bank (that subsidizes certain projects), and other lobbying organisations. This, combined with a lack of transparency regarding the decisions of the board leads to the members favouring political-economical over technical or scientific considerations. It seems clear that the CDM isn‚Äôt governed according to the rules of ‚Äògood governance‚Äô. Solving this problem might require a genuine democratization in the election of the EB-members and thus a shift in thinking from government to governance. In practice this would mean that all the stakeholders should get a voice in who can have a seat in the EB. Another important factor in the dysfunctionality of the EB is the lack of time, staff and financial resources it has to fully evaluate a project proposal. Moreover, the verification of a project is often outsourced to companies that also deliver services (such as accounting or consultancy) to enterprises setting up these same projects. In this way, the verifiers have serious incentives to deliver a positive report to the EB. This indicates that implementation is the place where the shoe pinches, as usually happens in environmental issues (mostly due to a lack of funds). There have been indications in recent years that the EB is becoming more strict in its decisions, due to the huge criticism and the board getting more experience. Exclusion of forest conservation/avoided deforestation from the CDM The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol excluded forest conservation as well as avoided deforestation from the CDM for a variety of political, practical and ethical reasons.A New Initiative to Use Carbon Trading for Tropical Forest Conservation] William F. Laurance(2007), Biotropica 39 (1), 20‚Äì24 However, carbon emissions from deforestation represent 18-25% of all emissions,Stern, N. 2006. Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change and will account for more carbon emissions in the next five years than all emissions from all aircraft since the Wright Brothers until at least 2025.Forests First in the Fight Against Climate Change, Global Canopy Programme, 2007 This means that there have been growing calls for the inclusion of forests in CDM schemes for the second commitment period from a variety of sectors, under the leadership of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, and brought together under the Forests Now Declaration, which has been signed by over 300 NGOs, business leaders, and policy makers. There is so far no international agreement about whether projects avoiding deforestation or conserving forests should be initiated through separate policies and measures or stimulated through the carbon market. One major concern is the enormous monitoring effort needed in order to make sure projects are indeed leading to increased carbon storage. There is also local opposition. For example, May 2, 2008, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), Indigenous leaders from around the world protested against the Clean Energy Mechanisms, especially against Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Reasons for including avoided deforestation projects in the CDM Combating global warming has broadly two components: decreasing the release of greenhouse gases and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emitters, such as coal- fired power plants, are known as \\"sources\\", and places where carbon and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can be sequestered, i.e. kept out of the atmosphere, are known as \\"sinks\\". The world's forests, particularly rain forests, are important carbon sinks, both because of their uptake of CO2 through photosynthesis and because of the amount of carbon stored in their woody biomass and the soil. When rain forests are logged and burned, not only do we lose the forests' capacity to take up CO2 from the atmosphere, but also the carbon stored in that biomass and soil is released into the atmosphere through release of roots from the soil and the burning of the woody plant matter. An emerging proposal, Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), would allow rain forest preservation to qualify for CDM project status. REDD has gained support through recent meetings of the COP, and will be examined at Copenhagen. Coal thermal power generation in India and China In July 2011, Reuters reported that a 4,000 MW coal thermal electricity generation plant in Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh had been registered with the CDM. CDM Watch and the Sierra Club criticised the plant's registration and its eligibility for certified emission reduction units as clearly not additional. A CDM spokesperson dismissed these claims. According to information provided to Reuters, there are total of five coal-fired electricity plants registered with the CDM, four in India with a capacity of 10,640 MW and one 2,000 MW plant in China. The five plants are eligible to receive 68.2 million CERs over a 10-year period with an estimated value of 661 million euros ($919 million) at a CER price of 9.70 euros. In September 2012, the Executive Board of the Clean Development Mechanism adopted rules confirming that new coal thermal power generation plants could be registered as CDM projects and could use the simplified rules called 'Programmes of Activities'. The organisation CDM-Watch described the decision as inconsistent with the objective of the CDM as it subsidised the construction of new coal power plants. CDM-Watch described the CERs that would be issued as \\"non- additional dirty carbon credits\\". Industrial gas projects Some CERs are produced from CDM projects at refrigerant-producing factories in non-Annex I countries that generate the powerful greenhouse gas HFC 23 as a by-product. These projects dominated the CDM's early growth, and are expected to generate 20% of all credited emission reductions by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 60). Paying for facilities to destroy HFC-23 can cost only 0.2-0.5 ‚Ç¨/tCO2. Industrialized countries were, however, paying around 20 ‚Ç¨/tCO2 for reductions that cost below 1 ‚Ç¨/tCO2. This provoked strong criticism. The scale of profits generated by HFC-23 projects threatened distortions in competitiveness with plants in industrialized countries that had already cleaned up their emissions (p. 60). In an attempt to address concerns over HFC-23 projects, the CDM Executive Board made changes in how these projects are credited. According to the Carbon Trust (2009, p. 60), these changes effectively ensure that: *the potential to capture emissions from these plants is exploited; *distortions are reduced; *and the risk of perverse incentives is capped. Carbon Trust (2009, p. 60) argued that criticizing the CDM for finding low-cost reductions seemed perverse. They also argued that addressing the problem with targeted funding was easy with hindsight, and that before the CDM, these emission reduction opportunities were not taken. Hydropower NGOs have criticized the inclusion of large hydropower projects, which they consider unsustainable, as CDM projects.{https://www.internationalrivers.org/km/taxonomy/term/1024} Lately, both the CDM EB and investors have become concerned about such projects for potential lack of additionality. One reason was that many of these projects had started well before applying for CDM status. In June 2008, third party validator T√úV S√úD Group rejected a hydropower project in China because the project proponents could not document that they had seriously considered CDM at the time the project was started. In July 2008, third party validators agreed that projects applying for CDM status more than one year after having taken their investment decision should not qualify for CDM status. Currently, the largest power plant to receive CDM registration is the Jirau Hydroelectric Plant in Brazil. Hydropower projects larger than 20 MW must document that they follow World Commission on Dams guidelines or similar guidelines in order to qualify for the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. As of 21 July 2008, CERs from hydropower projects are not listed on European carbon exchanges, because different member states interpret these limitations differently. Organisation seeking to measure the degree of compliance of individual projects with WCD principles can use the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol, recommended as the most practical currently available evaluation tool. Other concerns Renewable energy In the initial phase of the CDM, policy makers and NGOs were concerned about the lack of renewable energy CDM projects. As the new CDM projects are now predominantly renewables and energy efficiency projects, this is now less of an issue. Sinks NGOs, as well as several governments, have consistently been sceptical towards the inclusion of sinks as CDM projects. The main reasons were fear of oversupply, that such projects cannot guarantee permanent storage of carbon, and that the methods of accounting for carbon storage in biomass are complex and still under development. Consequently, two separate carbon currencies (temporary CERs and long-term CERs) were created for such projects. Such credits cannot be imported to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. The lack of demand for such projects have resulted in very limited supply: Currently (21 July 2008), only one sinks project has been registered under CDM. Windfarms in Western Sahara In 2012, it was announced, that a windfarm complex is going to be located near Laayoune, the capital city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Since this project is to be established under tight collaboration between the UN (which itself recognizes Western Sahara's status of a non-autonomous country) and the Moroccan government, it has been questioned by many parties supporting Western Sahara independence, including the Polisario. Suggestions In response to concerns of unsustainable projects or spurious credits, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other NGOs devised a ‚ÄòGold Standard‚Äô methodology to certify projects that uses much stricter criteria than required, such as allowing only renewable energy projects. For example, a South African brick kiln was faced with a business decision; replace its depleted energy supply with coal from a new mine, or build a difficult but cleaner natural gas pipeline to another country. They chose to build the pipeline with SASOL. SASOL claimed the difference in GHG emissions as a CDM credit, comparing emissions from the pipeline to the contemplated coal mine. During its approval process, the validators noted that changing the supply from coal to gas met the CDM's 'additionality' criteria and was the least cost-effective option.CDM Project 0177 Lawley Fuel Switch Project UNFCCC However, there were unofficial reports that the fuel change was going to take place anyway, although this was later denied by the company's press office. =Successes= Schneider (2007, p. 73) commented on the success of the CDM in reducing emissions from industrial plants and landfills. Schneider (2007) concluded by stating that if concerns over the CDM are properly addressed, it would continue to be an \\"important instrument in the fight against climate change.\\" See also * Certified Emission Reduction * Fossil fuel subsidies for developing countries * Obtaining ownership of land by productive use * Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance * China Carbon Forum (CCF) * Verified Carbon Standard * Additionality References Further reading  * Cassimon, D., M.

They are often referred to by a phonetic spelling of their organization's initials, as ‚ÄúSiegies‚Äù (in the comics). Tomax and Xamot are the commanders of the Crimson Guard. Toys The first Crimson Guard figure was released in 1985. The figure wore a red dress uniform with silver decorations and a red helmet with black mask that covered his entire face. The accessories included a rifle with bayonet and red backpack. In 1989, the figure was repainted yellow and gray as part of the special Python Patrol sub group. In 1991, an armored version of the Crimson Guard, known as the Crimson Guard Immortals was introduced, wielding tube rocket launchers and a squad automatic weapon. In 1993, near the end of the original 3 inch G.I. Joe line, lightly armored Crimson Guard Commanders were released. After the relaunch of the G.I. Joe line in 2001, other incarnations of the Crimson Guard were produced. The first was part of Hasbro's Direct to Consumer line, which featured a slightly redesigned look. Another is a new subset, featuring repaints of the 2005 Crimson Guard Force figures, redone in black and gold, with melee weapons, and named the Crimson Shadow Guard. Another notable toy incarnation of the Crimson Guard is the 2004 Operation Crimson Sabotage K.B. Toys Exclusive. The set consisted of three Crimson Guard figures, and included two vehicles; a crimson H.I.S.S. tank (High Speed Sentry), and a crimson A.S.P. (Assault Systems Pod) mobile flak emplacement.

All Crimson Guardsmen must hold a degree in either law or accounting, and be in top physical condition. They strive to present a facade of exemplary normalcy and civic responsibility, and are provided with fully supported cover identities, and even pre-fabricated \\"families\\". However, these agents are accumulating financial and political influence for Cobra through every means possible, supporting each other in creating schemes of blackmail, fraud and espionage. Each member is rigorously trained and inducted in a secret ceremony in the lowest levels of Cobra's headquarters. To be a Crimson Guard is to swear absolute loyalty to Cobra and Cobra Commander. Many members also become part of a \\"series\\", undergoing plastic surgery and behavior modification to look and act like one another within a series. This allows one series member to completely replace another should the need arise without arousing suspicion. The most commonly depicted is the \\"Fred\\" Series. =Marvel Comics= A Fred is assigned early on to spy on Fort Wadsworth, the suspected home of the G.I. Joe. He tends to miss important intelligence by coincidence. This Fred is killed during an attempt by Destro to kill Snake Eyes in his mountain cabin. The Fred who replaces him turns out to be Wade Collins, a soldier who served with Stalker, Snake-Eye and Storm Shadow in Vietnam and believes that he was abandoned by the U.S. Army during the war and by his country afterwards, leading him to join Cobra in a fit of bitterness. Collins eventually decides to leave Cobra and, with help from G.I. Joe, relocates with his family. Collins' son, Kamakura, eventually joins G.I. Joe. Fred VII is one of the noted Guard members. He is an owner of an auto repair shop and a developer of advanced cybernetic and bionic devices. This Fred would gain infamy when, from 1987 to the early 1990s, he would pretend to be Cobra Commander,\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #64 (October 1987) donning the silver \\"battle armor\\" that the action figures introduced in the late 1980s. Fred VII's coup is destroyed when the real Cobra Commander made his return.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #98 (March 1990) Another Guardsman, Appel, is featured in multiple G.I. Joe comic books. He is revealed when Joe forces attack his suburban home.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #38 He later comes up with part of the plan that creates Cobra Island.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #40-41 Appel's daughter, Candy, also influences the plot at the same time as she is the romantic interest of Ripcord. At one point, Appel even saves Ripcord from certain death on account of his daughter.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\\" #48 (1986) Later, again on Cobra Island, Crimson Guardsmen (with Cobra Trooper backup) are deployed into three sniper teams. They planned to assassinate Serpentor when he arrived with personnel picked up from the town of Springfield. This plan is deduced and the sniper teams are foiled when Serpentor literally hangs onto Cobra Commander, then whips the crowd up into a frenzy of good cheer. They are ordered off their shots for fear of starting a riot.\\"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #52 (October 1986) The Guard end up on the battlefield during the first Cobra civil war.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #74-76 =Action Force= Action Force is a series of comics with the Joe characters based out of London. In issue #11, two Crimson Guards, one male and one female, attempt to destroy the Eiffel Tower but are stopped by a Joe team.\\"Action Force\\" #6 (April 11th 1987) In the next issue, ten more Guards are captured in a raid on a Cobra base/fast food restaurant.\\"Action Force\\" #7 (April 18th 1987) A Guardsman makes a cameo as the co-pilot for Copperhead.\\"Action Force\\" #21-22 (1987) Later, a CG undercover is revealed as working as a school teacher.

Agent X-99 was first seen in the Sunbow Episode \\"The Germ\\" The flashback series 'Declassified' showcased an early participant in the CG program.G.I.Joe: Declassified #1-3 (June‚ÄìOctober 2006) A Crimson Guardsman named Colonel Calvin is featured in an early storyline in America's Elite. He was assigned to a research station in the Amazon, well before the Crimson Twins joined Cobra. Surrounded only by BATs, cut off from support for unknown reasons, he went mad. He decides to make Cobra Commander pay for abandoning him and rigs an ICBM to attack his current location. Somehow Calvin found out about Cobra Commander disguising himself as a member of the US President's cabinet. Duke tracks down Calvin and is held captive by him. Duke breaks free and kills Calvin, but not before finding out about Cobra Commander.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #7-10 (2006) Another Guardsman is featured in later stories. This particular Guardsman rises through the ranks to the elite Shadow Guard. He is picked from them to become part of The Plague, an elite squad created from Cobra ranks to become an answer to G. I. Joe, and given the codename Infrared. Like the Shadow Guard, the Plague is answerable directly to Cobra Commander. All the Plague members receive biographies in issue 30 of America's Elite. The Joes suspect this Guardsman of being a movie actor.G.I. Joe: America's Elite #30 (2007) Animated series =Sunbow= These soldiers, which are featured in the cartoon G.I. Joe, are the elite of Cobra. As with all soldiers in the first season they fight on land, sea, and air acting almost as officers as well as serving as Cobra Commander's bodyguards. On at least one occasion, Cobra Commander refers to his \\"Red Guard\\". In the first-season episodes after the \\"Pyramid of Darkness\\" mini- series, Crimson Guard members also act as deep-cover or sleeper agents, conducting operations in civilian guises that would require either too many operatives or too long an operation time for Zartan to be a feasible agent. In the second season, they seemed to serve more as bodyguards than anything else. The Crimson Guard is led by the mirror twins characters Tomax and Xamot, who handle all of Cobra's business affairs. They are in direct command of the Crimson Guard; however, Tomax and Xamot are loyal to Cobra Commander, in turn, putting the Crimson Guard at Cobra Commander's disposal. During the second season, Tomax and Xamot became loyal to Serpentor, which in turn placed the Crimson Guard out of Cobra Commander's disposal and into Serpentor's disposal. Different voice actors have voiced members of the Crimson Guard: Michael Bell, Chris Latta, and Lee Weaver. The Crimson Guard X-99 from \\"The Germ\\" was voiced by Neil Ross. =DiC= In the Dragon Fire mini-series of the 1989 G.I. Joe cartoon, their new leader was Destro and some were part of a group of Cobra soldiers who became Python Patrol Crimson Guards and under the newly restored Cobra Commander overthrew Serpentor. Additionally, an undercover Crimson Guardsman infiltrates G.I. Joe as a reporter and is offered a position on the team as war correspondent Scoop. He later learns Cobra lied to him and joins G.I. Joe for real. His Cobra handler, another CG, switches divisions and becomes an Alley Viper. In \\"The Greatest Evil\\" two-parter, a Crimson Guard Immortal's sister is hospitalized after overdosing on the drug Spark, created by the Headman. This Siegie teams meets Duke whose brother Falcon is also an addict. The two agree to join forces to stop the Headman. Despite his love for his sister, the Siegie gets caught up in Cobra's scheme to use the alliance to rob the Headman of his profits. His sister and Falcon team up to replace the money with worthless paper and then donate the real money to drug rehab programs. =Renegades= In the G.I. Joe: Renegades episode \\"Brothers of Light,\\" the Crimson Guard are homaged as the elite guards for Tomax and Xamot's cult. A brainwashed Duke, Scarlett, and Roadblock were shown as Crimson Guards until Tunnel Rat and Snake Eyes freed them from the mind- control. References External links * Crimson Guard at JMM's G.I.

He is the half brother of the current President of UAE, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He is also the chairman of the ministerial council for services, the Emirates Investment Authority and the Emirates Racing Authority.

Mansour also owns stakes in a number of business ventures, including Virgin Galactic and Sky News Arabia. He is also the owner of the privately held Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), a specialist investment company that acquired Manchester City Football Club in September 2008, though immediately handed all responsibility and ownership to Khaldoon Al Mubarak and the City Football Group which has overseen a significant transformation at the club since then. The club have won four top flight league titles for the first time since 1968, City's first Premier League titles. On 21 May 2013, Major League Soccer of the United States announced that its second New York City club, to be called New York City FC, would begin play in the 2015 season and be majority-owned by Mansour in association with brothers Hal and Hank Steinbrenner. Early life and education Mansour was born in the Abu Dhabi emirate on 20 November 1970, the fifth son of the Emir of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. His mother is Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi and he has five full-brothers: Crown Prince Mohammed, Hamdan, Hazza, Tahnoun, and Abdullah. They are known as Bani Fatima or sons of Fatima. Mansour attended Santa Barbara Community College as an English student in 1989. He is a graduate of United Arab Emirates University where he received a bachelor's degree in international affairs in 1993. Political career In 1997, Mansour bin Zayed was appointed chairman of the presidential office, which his father Zayed II is the first and by-then president of UAE. After the death of his father, he was appointed by his eldest half brother, Khalifa II, as first minister of presidential affairs of the United Arab Emirates, which is the merger of the presidential office and presidential court. He also served in a number of positions in Abu Dhabi to support his brother, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He was appointed chairman of the ministerial council for services, which is considered a ministerial entity attached to the Cabinet, comprising a number of ministers heading the services departments. Since 2000 he chaired National Center for Documentation and Research. In 2004 reshuffle, he became minister for presidential affairs. In 2005, he became the deputy chairman of the Abu Dhabi education council (ADEC), chairman of the Emirates Foundation, Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority, and Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. In 2006, he was named the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department. In 2007, he was appointed chairman of Khalifa bin Zayed Charity Foundation. Mansour served as the chairman of First Gulf Bank until 2006, and as a member of the board of trustees of the Zayed charitable and humanitarian foundation. Mansour has established scholarship programs for U.A.E students to study abroad. He is also chairman of the Emirates horse racing authority (EHRA). On 11 May 2009, he was appointed deputy prime minister, retaining his cabinet post of minister of presidential affairs. Business portfolio Mansour heads IPIC, which owns 71% of Aabar Investments and is used as an investment vehicle. After the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal was highlighted and Khadem al-Qubaisi, who was managing IPIC, was arrested in 2016, IPIC was folded into Aabar Investments. Qubaisi blamed Mansour and the UAE authorities for using him as a scapegoat in the affair. Mansour is the chairman of the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department and Qubaisi is being held in prison without charge. In 2005, he was appointed as a member of the Supreme Petroleum Council. In the same year he chaired the board of directors of IPIC and became the board member of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). In 2007, he was appointed chairman of the Emirates Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of UAE. Mansour has a 32% stake in Virgin Galactic after investing $280 million in the project through Aabar in July 2009. Aabar also has a 9.1% stake in Daimler after purchasing the stake for $2.7 billion in March 2009 and it was reported that Aabar wishes to increase its stake to 15% in August 2010. He owns the Abu Dhabi Media Investment Corporation (ADMIC) which partnered with British Sky Broadcasting to establish Sky News Arabia ‚Äì a new Arabic-language news channel headquartered in Abu Dhabi. ADMIC also owns the English-language newspaper The National. =Sport= Mansour is an accomplished horse rider and has won a number of endurance racing tournaments held in the Middle East, and is chairman of the Emirates horse racing authority. He is a strong supporter of Arabian horse racing and the patron of the annual Zayed International Half Marathon competition in Abu Dhabi.Abbasher, Yasir (8 January 2010). Full Zayed marathon next year. Gulf News. Retrieved 17 February 2010. He is the chairman of the Al Jazira sports company and was a leading figure in Abu Dhabi's successful bid to host the FIFA Club World Cup in 2009 and 2010. The company owns Al Jazira Club, which plays football, volleyball, handball and basketball. The football club won the President's Cup in 2010-2011 and 2011‚Äì2012. In September 2008, Sheikh Mansour acquired Manchester City football club from former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. By 23 September 2008, the Abu Dhabi United Group, backed by Mansour, completed their takeover negotiations and the ownership was transferred to them. He also owns the City Football Group, which was founded in 2014 and consists of Manchester City FC, Melbourne City FC, New York City FC, and others. City's ownership was deemed as United Arab Emirates' attempt to \\"sportswash\\" its image and as an instrument of foreign policy by several human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW). In 2014, UEFA found that Manchester City breached the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. The club was fined ¬£49 million, while ¬£32 million were suspended. Moreover, City's Champions League squad for 2014-15 was reduced to only 21 players. In 2018, the club came under fresh allegations of breach. German newspaper Der Spiegel wrote a four-chapter story highlighting that Mansour neglected FFP rules and bulked up 'sponsorship' deals with his own money. The Emirati provided ¬£59.5 million of a ¬£67.5 million for an agreement signed with Etihad Airways. The report also revealed a ¬£15 million annual deal with an investment firm Aabar, through an internal email sent by executive Simon Pearce in April 2010. The club refused to comment and called it an attempt to damage their reputation was \\"organised and clear\\". City stated that the emails and documents have been obtained illegally. A book called Can We Have Our Football Back? How the Premier League Is Ruining Football And What We Can Do About It, by John Nicholson reportedly claims that Premier League has corrupted football by turning the sport into a money making business. The alleged 'sportswash' campaign run by Manchester City is among the several scandals mentioned by Nicholson in his book, demanding scrutiny towards them. In May 2019, UEFA opened investigation into Manchester City on allegations that the club misled European soccer's financial regulators. However, the club still reserved right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In November 2019, the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled against Manchester City's attempt to block investigation into breach of financial fair play rules. As per the records published by Court of Arbitration, Manchester City in its appeal to block investigation for FFP claimed damages from UEFA. The club claimed that the alleged leaks by Der Spigel were \\"unlawful\\" in regards to a possible inquiry. However, Yves Leterme dismissed the claims calling them \\"groundless\\" and \\"unacceptable in tone\\" In February 2020, Manchester City were banned from the UEFA Champions League for two seasons after they were found guilty of violating the financial fair play rule. UEFA in its statement said: \\"Manchester City Football Club committed serious breaches of the UEFA club licensing and financial fair play regulations.\\" The adjudicatory chamber also informed that the club overstated its sponsorship revenue and used biased calculating methods for the financial accounts submitted between 2012 and 2016. The club responding to the verdict said that it would now approach the Court of Arbitration for Sport and initiate proceedings as soon as possible. On July 13, 2020, the CAS cleared Man city of FFP violations, uplifted its 2 year UEFA Champions League ban and reduced its fine to ‚Ç¨10million. Yet days later, CAS revealed that Manchester City showed \\"blatant disregard\\" to UEFA‚Äôs investigation. And said that the club \\"on countless occasions refused to answer questions, refused to provide documents, refused to arrange for the attendance of requested persons and - ultimately - it even instructed its own expert witness not to answer specific questions\\". Personal life Mansour married Sheikha Alia bint Mohammed bin Butti Al Hamed in the mid-1990s. They have one son, Zayed. In 2005, Mansour married Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. She is the daughter of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ruler of Dubai. They have two daughters and three sons: Fatima (2006), Mohammed (2007), Hamdan (2011), Latifa (2014) and Rashid (2017) Mansour is the owner of the yacht Topaz.Mohammed bin Salman vs Sheikh Mansour: As Saudi Prince is linked with Man Utd, how does he compare to Man City owner?

LACMA M.2007.211.380 A hoop skirt or hoopskirt is a women's undergarment worn in various periods to hold the skirt extended into a fashionable shape. It originated as a modest-sized mechanism for holding long skirts away from one's legs, to stay cooler in hot climates and to keep from tripping on the skirt during various activities. Small hoops might be worn by farmers and while working in the garden. Hoops were then adopted as a fashion item, and the size and scale of the hoops grew in grandeur, especially during the mid-nineteenth century transition from the 1850s to the 1860s.Fogg, Marnie: Fashion: The Whole Story, 2013, Prestel, New York, New York, As the society of consumerism evolved, the roles of men and women changed and so did their dress. As male dress became tailored, the female costume of the period made women practically immobilized due to the cumbersome amount of petticoats needed to suit the era's style. When the circular crinoline came out in 1856, it was a revelation not only of technology but of convenience for women. By the 1870s, the cage of the crinoline became a cage only at the rear of the woman's undergarments. This is known today as a bustle. Hoop skirts typically consist of a fabric petticoat sewn with channels designed to act as casings for stiffening materials, such as rope, osiers, whalebone, steel, or, from the mid-20th century, nylon.Arnold, Janet: Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560-1620, Macmillan 1985.Arnold, Janet: Patterns of Fashion 2: Englishwomen's Dresses and Their Construction 1860-1940, Wace 1966, Macmillan 1972. Hoop skirts are called by various names in different periods: *Farthingale (Spanish verdugado) (16th century) *Panniers or \\"side hoops\\" (18th century) *Crinoline or crinolette (mid-19th century) Lightweight hoop skirts, usually with nylon hoops, are worn today under very full-skirted wedding gowns. They can sometimes be seen in the gothic fashion scene. Reproduction hoop skirts are an essential part of living history costuming, especially American Civil War reenactment.

It has transformed old practices in the language classroom and has given origin to self access language learning centers around the world such as the SALC at Kanda University of International Studies in Japan, the ASLLC at The Education University of Hong Kong, the SAC at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and ELSAC at the University of Auckland . As the result of such practices, language teaching is now sometimes seen as the same as language learning, and it has placed the learner in the centre of attention in language learning education in some places.Promoting Learner Autonomy, a research project by the HKIEd; http://www.learner-autonomy.org There is a comprehensive bibliography for learner autonomy.Hayo Reinders (2016) Autonomy Bibliography, from Innovation in Teaching Definition The term \\"learner autonomy\\" was first coined in 1981 by Henri Holec, the \\"father\\" of learner autonomy. Many definitions have since been given to the term, depending on the writer, the context, and the level of debate educators have come to. It has been considered as a personal human trait, as a political measure, or as an educational move. This is because autonomy is seen either (or both) as a means or as an end in education. Some of the most well known definitions in present literature are:D. Garner & L. Miller (2011) Managing Self-assess Language Learning: Principles and Practice, System 39(1): 78‚Äì89Leni Dam (1995) Autonomy from Theory to Classroom Practice, Dublin: Authentik * \\"Autonomy is the ability to take charge of one's own learning.\\" (Henri Holec Holec, Henri (1981) Autonomy and Foreign Language Learning, Oxford: Pergamon Press) * \\"In order to help learners to assume greater control over their own learning it is important to help them to become aware of and identify the strategies that they already use or could potentially use.\\" (Holmes & Ramos, 1991, cited in James & Garrett, 1991: 198). * \\"Autonomy is essentially a matter of the learner's psychological relation to the process and content of learning.\\" (David Little) * \\"Autonomy is a situation in which the learner is totally responsible for all the decisions concerned with his [or her] learning and the implementation of those decisions.\\"Leslie Dickinson (1994) \\"Preparing Learners: Toolkit requirements for Preparing/Orienting Learners\\", pages 39 to 49 in E. Esch, Self-access and the Adult Language Learner, London: CILT * \\"Autonomy is a recognition of the rights of learners within educational systems.\\"Phil Benson (2000) \\"Autonomy as a learners‚Äô and teachers‚Äô right\\", pages 111 to 117 in Learner Autonomy, Teacher Autonomy: Future Directions, London: Longmans One of the key aspects to consider in defining Learner Autonomy is whether we view it as a means to an end (learning a foreign language) or as an end in itself (making people autonomous learners). These two options do not exclude each other, both of them can be part of our views towards language learning or learning in general. Learner autonomy is very useful in learning a new language. It is much more beneficial to learn a language by being exposed to it in comparison to learning patterns of different tenses. In the view of cultural-historical psychology, the development of a students learning skills is never entirely separable from the content of their learning, seeing as learning a new language is quite different to learning any other subject. It is important that the students discover the language for themselves, with only a little guidance from their teacher so that they can fully understand it. Independence, autonomy and the ability to control learning experiences has come to play an increasingly important role in language education. Principles of learner autonomy could be:(Frank Lacey) * Autonomy means moving the focus from teaching to learning. * Autonomy affords maximum possible influence to the learners. * Autonomy encourages and needs peer support and cooperation. * Autonomy means making use of self/peer assessment. * Autonomy requires and ensures 100% differentiation. * Autonomy can only be practised with student logbooks which are a documentation of learning and a tool of reflection. * The role of the teacher as supporting scaffolding and creating room for the development of autonomy is very demanding and very important. * Autonomy means empowering students, yet the classroom can be restrictive, so are the rules of chess or tennis, but the use of technology can take students outside of the structures of the classroom, and the students can take the outside world into the classroom. Also it is someone who works independently and who takes pride in their work For an introduction to learner autonomy, see Reinders (2010) Educational assessment There have been numerous studies relating the cognitive factors associated with autonomous learning.Reeve, J., Bolt, E., & Cai, Y. (1999) \\"Autonomy-supportive teachers: How they teach and motivate students\\", Journal of Educational Psychology 91(3), 537-548Murdock, T. B., Anderman, L. H., & Hodge, S. A. (2000) \\"Middle-grade predictors of students‚Äô motivation and behavior in high school\\", Journal of Adolescent Research 15(3), 327-351 The salient characteristics associated with autonomous learning (resourcefulness, initiative, and persistence) are crucial for high school-level students. Currently, the school structure in place in the US is composed of a ladder system of advancement as directed solely by academic achievement. As students proceed up the ladder, they are exposed to ever greater needs for learner autonomy. This increase in learner autonomy does not have a linear incremental increase throughout the 13 grades (from K-12), but shows a dramatic increase in the transition from middle (or junior high) school to high school. Studies suggest that students taught methods for autonomous learning have a greater probability of succeeding in a high school setting. Further, students screened for their level of autonomous learning perform better than those advanced simply on scholarly achievement Doug Dillner (2005) Dissertation from Regent University An instrument for assessing learner autonomy may play a significant role in determining a student‚Äôs readiness for high school.The Autonomy Project at the Hong Kong Institute of Education Such an instrument now exists that is appropriate for the adolescent learner. This instrument is suitable for assessing suitability for greater learner autonomy; a quality that should be present in high school students.  Characteristics of the autonomous learner  According to Philip C. Candy,Philip C. Candy (1991) Self-direction for Lifelong Learning, pages 459 to 66, Jossey-Bass at Google Books there are over 100 competencies associated with autonomy in learning. Candy (1991) states that autonomous learners are; * methodical/disciplined * logical/analytical * reflective/self-aware * motivated/curious * flexible * interdependent/inter- personally competent * responsible/persistent * venturesome/creative * creative/have positive self-concept * independent/self-sufficient * skilled in seeking/retrieving information * knowledgeable about/skilled in learning * able to develop/use evaluation criteria See also * Anarchistic free school * Anti-schooling activism * Autodidacticism * Deschooling * Deschooling Society * Education reform * Sudbury school * Unschooling References Category:Autonomy Category:Lifelong learning Category:Language education ","title":"Learner autonomy"},{"id":"2152802","title":"Corey Sevier"},{"id":"2152804","text":"Nootdorp is a town in the Dutch province of South Holland.

Their first known occurrence in the fossil record is during the Devonian period, 417‚Äì354 million years ago. The nymphs (younger stages) go through little or even no metamorphosis, hence they resemble the adult specimens. Their skin is thin, making them appear translucent. Currently, no species are listed as being at conservation risk. The term Apterygota refers to two separate clades of wingless insects: Archeognatha comprises jumping bristletails, while Zygentoma comprises silverfish and firebrats. The Zygentoma are in the clade Dicondylia with winged insects, a clade that includes all other insects. The group Apterygota is not a clade; it is paraphyletic.  Characteristics  The primary characteristic of the apterygotes is they are primitively wingless. While some other insects, such as fleas, also lack wings, they nonetheless descended from winged insects but have lost them during the course of evolution. By contrast, the apterygotes are a primitive group of insects that diverged from other ancient orders before wings evolved. Apterygotes, however, have the demonstrated capacity for directed, aerial gliding descent from heights. It has been suggested by researchers that this evolved gliding mechanism in apterygotes might have provided an evolutionary basis from which winged insects would later evolve the capability for powered flight. Apterygotes also have a number of other primitive features not shared with other insects. Males deposit sperm packages, or spermatophores, rather than fertilizing the female internally. When hatched, the young closely resemble adults and do not undergo any significant metamorphosis, and lack even an identifiable nymphal stage. They continue to molt throughout life, undergoing multiple instars after reaching sexual maturity, whereas all other insects undergo only a single instar when sexually mature. Apterygotes possess small appendages, referred to as \\"styli\\", on some of their abdominal segments, but play no part in locomotion. They also have long, paired abdominal cerci and a single median, tail-like caudal filament, or telson.  History of the concept  The composition and classification of Apterygota changed over time. By the mid-20th century, the subclass included four orders (Collembola, Protura, Diplura, and Thysanura). With the advent of a more rigorous cladistic methodology, the subclass was proven paraphyletic. While the first three groups formed a monophyletic group, the Entognatha, distinguished by having mouthparts submerged in a pocket formed by the lateral and ventral parts of the head capsule, the Thysanura (Zygentoma plus Archaeognatha) appeared to be more closely related to winged insects. The most notable synapomorphy proving the monophyly of Thysanura+Pterygota is the absence of intrinsic antennal muscles, which connect the antennomeres in entognaths, myriapods, and crustaceans. For this reason, the whole group is often termed the Amyocerata, meaning \\"lacking antennal muscles\\". However, the Zygentoma are now considered more closely related to the Pterygota than to the Archaeognatha,A. Blanke, M. Koch, B. Wipfler, F. Wilde, B. Misof (2014) Head morphology of Tricholepidion gertschi indicates monophyletic Zygentoma. Frontiers in Zoology 11:16 doi:10.1186/1742-9994-11-16 thus rendering even the amyocerate apterygotes paraphyletic, and resulting in the dissolution of Thysanura into two separate monophyletic orders.

First arising in Thule times, it has traditionally been used in summer to move people and possessions to seasonal hunting grounds and for hunting whales and walrus.Umiaks at the Canadian Museum of Civilization Although the umiak was usually propelled by oars (women) or paddles (men), sails‚Äîsometimes made from seal intestines‚Äîwere also used, and in the 20th century, outboard motors.Adney & Chappelle p.190Adney & Chappelle p.179 Because the umiak has no keel, the sails cannot be used for tacking. Size and construction Umiak frame Like the kayak, the traditional umiak was made from a driftwood or whalebone frame pegged and lashed together, sometimes with antlers or ivory, over which walrus or bearded seal skins are stretched. Oil, usually from seals, would be used to coat and waterproof the seams.Umiak Construction, Museum of Civilization website A large umiak, , would require that about seven skins be sewn together, stretched over the frame and allowed to dry. Modern versions are essentially identical, with the exception of the use of metal bolts and screws. The open umiak is significantly larger than the enclosed kayak, which was built to carry one or two men while hunting. Normally , the umiak could be anywhere from and wide.Umiak at the Canadian EncyclopediaExamples of Umiaks, Museum of Civilization website Hans Egede, a Norwegian-Danish Lutheran missionary to Greenland in 1721, stated that he had seen umiaks long. Although an umiak could carry up to 15 passengers, its light weight and lack of a keel allows it to be carried over the drift or shore ice to the open water by a few people.The Women's Boat at athropolis.com A modern company which trains people to hand make umiaks says that a boat weighs about compared to for a modern vessel.The Umiak at Skinboat School Modern usage An expedition in Alaska Although the usage of the umiak and the kayak has died out in most areas of the Arctic it is still very much a part of life in the Yupik and Inupiat whaling villages of Alaska. The boat must be hauled on a sled pulled by snowmobile over very rough trails cut through the ice ridges to locations where there are open leads in the ice pack, where it is used to catch whales. The skin cover on an umiak will last for two or three years, as does an aluminum boat used in the same way; however, replacing the skin on an umiak is much easier than repairing an aluminum boat. Additionally, the bowhead whale is sensitive to the metallic noise from aluminum boats, and tend to move away under the ice, to avoid them. In Utqiaƒ°vik, Alaska, the process for replacing the skin of an umiak begins when the ice moves away from the shores of the Arctic Ocean in July. At their first summer access to the ocean, whaling crews hunt for oogruk, the bearded seal, for suitable skins. The skins are packed into seal oil and allowed to ferment while they are stored until March. At that time the skins are scraped free of hair, sewn together with a waterproof stitch, and then stretched over the wooden frame and tied into place using the sinew from caribou. With a new skin on the frame, the umiak is placed out in the wind and cold, to dry. In May when the bowhead whales migrate eastward past Point Barrow, umiak skin boats are hauled on sleds pulled by snowmobiles out onto the ice. Name Umiaks being used for transport in Greenland in the summer of 1875, with kayaks travelling alongside. Although it is sometimes called a \\"woman's boat\\", modern Inuit dictionaries such as Kangiryuarmiut Uqauhingita Numiktittitdjutingit by Ronald Lowe, the Inuinnaqtun English Dictionary, and Asuilaak Inuktitut Living Dictionary translate umiak as boat, traditional skin boat, or any type of boat.Asuilaak Inuktitut Living Dictionary In the Eastern Arctic, where the umiak was rarely used for hunting, it was used mainly as summer transport for women and children, while men travelled by kayak, and thus was known as a \\"woman's boat\\".

Plain-woven linen and cane. Panniers or side hoops are women's undergarments worn in the 17th and 18th centuries to extend the width of the skirts at the side while leaving the front and back relatively flat. This provided a panel where woven patterns, elaborate decorations and rich embroidery could be displayed and fully appreciated.  History  The style originated in Spanish court dress of the 17th century, familiar in portraits by Vel√°zquez. The fashion spread to France and from there to the rest of Europe after c. 1718‚Äì1719, when some Spanish dresses had been displayed in Paris. It is also suggested that the pannier originated in Germany or England, having been around since 1710 in England, and appearing in the French court in the last years of Louis XIV‚Äôs reign. The earlier form of the pannier took the shape similar to a 19th-century crinoline. They were wide and domed in circumference. As they developed, they differed from earlier equivalents such as the farthingale of the late 16th century, by not extending equally in all directions, but being very wide at the sides, but not coming out so far to front and back. By the mid-century, the \\"shoulders\\" were rather abrupt, not gently curved. By the mid-18th century, a woman took up three times as much space as a man and always presented an imposing spectacle. At their most extreme, panniers could extend the skirt several feet at each side. By the 1780s, panniers were normally worn only with very formal gowns and within court fashion. The name comes from panniers, a French term for wicker baskets slung on either side of a pack animal.

In March 1944, he broke out of Stalag Luft III ‚Äì a prisoner-of-war camp in Nazi Germany ‚Äì during the mass break-out known as \\"The Great Escape\\". After crossing much of occupied Europe, to reach neutral Spain, Van der Stok became one of only three out of the 76 escapees to reach Britain, along with two Norwegians, Per Bergsland and Jens M√ºller (who together managed to reach neutral Sweden). Early years Van der Stok spent his childhood between Sumatra, the Netherlands, and the Dutch West Indies, where his father was employed with Shell Petroleum. After finishing his primary education at the Lyceum Alpinum in Switzerland, he studied Medicine at Leiden University with the intention of pursuing the career of a physician. Whilst at Leiden he was an enthusiastic sportsman, focusing on rowing and ice hockey. In 1937 he joined the Reserve of the Netherlands' Luchtvaartafdeeling (Army Aviation Group) ‚Äì a precursor of the Royal Netherlands Air Force, training on the Fokker S.IV, whilst continuing his medical studies at Utrecht University. World War II When the Netherlands was attacked and invaded by the Third Reich in May 1940, van der Stok ‚Äì now flying with the Netherlands' Air Force's renamed Luchtvaartbrigade (Army Aviation Brigade), scored his first victory when he shot down a Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 whilst on patrol in a Fokker D.XXI over De Kooy airfield, and also took part in an air attack on the Netherlands' Waalhaven Airport, which had been seized by the Germans and was being used by the Luftwaffe for operations. After the Netherlands' defeat and occupation by the Wehrmacht, he made three unsuccessful attempts to follow the Dutch Crown in its withdrawal across the North Sea to England. On the fourth attempt, he managed to reach Scotland in June 1941 as a stowaway aboard the Swiss merchant ship Saint Cerque, which had sailed out of Rotterdam, along with Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema and two others. He was awarded the Dutch Bronze Cross by Queen Wilhelmina for his actions. Following a refresher and conversion course with the Royal Air Force's No.57 Operational Training Unit, he was posted to its No.41 Squadron in December 1941 flying the Supermarine Spitfire, with which he went on to achieve six confirmed kills amongst Luftwaffe aircraft up to April 1942, therewith qualifying as a flying ace. =Capture, imprisonment and escape= Stalag Luft III mockup. On 12 April 1942, during an operation code-named 'Circus 122' over occupied North France to attack the railway marshalling yard at Hazebrouck, van der Stok was shot down whilst flying Spitfire Vb BL595. He parachuted down safely at Saint-Omer in the Pas-de-Calais, but was immediately captured by a Wehrmacht patrol.In his war memoir, van der Stok cites the date of his capture as 14 July 1942, but from his original RAF 'Escape & Evasion Report' (dated 11 July 1944) at England's National Archive, the date of capture is given as 12 April 1942. He was subsequently incarcerated in the newly built Stalag Luft III where, with his medical training, he worked in the prison's medical facility. Whilst at Stalag Luft III he made three escape attempts. The first was inadvertently spoiled by another prisoner who drew attention to the escaping van der Stok while retrieving a stolen German cap from the roof of a hut. The second attempt was thwarted when the German guards noticed that a forged pass he was using to get past them was out of date. His third attempt, on the night of 24‚Äì25 March 1944, was as a part of the mass break-out later known as \\"The Great Escape\\", in which he was the eighteenth of 76 prisoners to leave the escape tunnel. In his memoir he describes the moment he came out of the tunnel on 24 March, writing: \\"Quickly, I climbed up to the surface and immediately found the rope . . . I felt no signal, so it was not safe yet. Then I felt three distinct tugs and slowly popped my head up. The nearest 'Goonbox' was at least 200 feet away; but, indeed, I was twenty feet from the edge of the woods.\\" After the break-out, van der Stok travelled from Breslau train station to Dresden where he was stopped at several checkpoints, convincing the Germans that he was not one of the escapees. He then travelled to Utrecht through Oldenzaal and met up with a member of the Dutch underground, who briefed and equipped him for a bicycle trek to another safe house run by the Belgian Resistance. After arriving there, he was given the paperwork of a Belgian, and then travelled by train via Brussels and Paris to Toulouse, where the French Resistance put him with two American lieutenants, two other RAF pilots, a French officer and a Russian, and took the group across the Pyrenees to Lleida in Spain. The British consulate in Spain accepted the Allied escapees and, three months after the break-out of Stalag Luft III, van der Stok reached British Empire territory once again by arriving in Gibraltar on 8 July 1944. He was subsequently flown from Gibraltar to Whitchurch Airport in England on 11 July 1944.In his war memoir, van der Stok gives the date of his arrival back in England as 20 May 1944, but his original RAF 'Escape & Evasion Report' (dated 11 July 1944) at England's National Archive gives the actual date as 11 July 1944. Back in England, van der Stok rejoined the RAF and was posted to No.41 Squadron flying the Spitfire MK.XII's, going on to fight in Operation Overlord - (10 days after D-Day) and the anti-V-1 fighter aircraft sweeps along the Low Countries coast. In his book War Pilot of Orange, he claims to have downed seven V-1 'Doodlebugs'. The following year, he took command of the Dutch RAF No.322 Squadron, based then on a temporary airstrip at Schijndel in the Netherlands, where, coming into contact with his family for the first time since he had left the Netherlands in 1940, he learned that his two brothers had been killed in concentration camps and his father had been partially blinded by the Gestapo. Postwar He was awarded the Order of Orange Nassau from the Netherlands, and was inducted as a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He was offered a permanent commission and senior staff rank with the Royal Netherlands Air Force, but declined it and instead resumed and completed his prewar study, qualifying with a degree in medicine from the University of Utrecht in 1951. Later life He relocated to the United States with his wife Lucie and their three children, and began practice as an OB-GYN in Syracuse, New York, and as a general practitioner in Ruidoso, New Mexico. He subsequently joined NASA's space lab research team in Huntsville, Alabama. In 1980 he published a war memoir entitled: Oorlogsvlieger van Oranje (War Pilot of Orange). In 1987 Van der Stok moved to Honolulu, where he continued in medical practice. He also worked with the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, and took part in 162 rescues. Personal life Van der Stok married Lucia Maria Beata Walter, who died in Santa Barbara, California in 1990. Death Van der Stok died at Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA, on 8 February 1993. Legacy In the 1963 film The Great Escape, elements of his part in the affair were written into the role of \\"Sedgwick\\", played by the actor James Coburn. In 2018, a brooch, awarded to him by the Caterpillar Club to acknowledge his use of an Irvin parachute to bail out of a stricken aircraft, sold for ¬£3226 at auction, beating its estimate of ¬£500-600. In February 2019 a new edition of his memoir was published by Greenhill Books, London, with a preface by The Times journalist Simon Pearson and a foreword by Bram's son Robert Vanderstok. Honours A C-130 Hercules of the Royal Netherlands Air Force is named after him.

It was built at the behest of Ivan the Terrible on the ruins of the former castle of Kazan khans. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000. History and monuments Kazan Kreml' in 1630 Kazan Kreml' in 1839 Saviour-Transfiguration monastery in 19th century Kazan Kreml' in 1911 Kremlin from bird's view Main entrance with Spasskaya Tower in early 20th century The Kazan Kremlin includes many old buildings, the oldest of which is the Annunciation Cathedral (1554‚Äî62), the only 16th-century Russian church to have six piers and five apses. Like many of Kazan's buildings of the period, it is constructed of local pale sandstone rather than of brick. The renowned Pskov architects Postnik Yakovlev and Ivan Shirjay (called Barma) were invited by the Tzar to rebuild the Kazan Kremlin in stone. The cathedral bell tower was erected in five tiers at the urging of Ivan the Terrible and was scored to resemble the Ivan the Great Belltower in Moscow, but was pulled down by the Soviets in 1930. The most conspicuous landmark of the Kazan Kremlin is the leaning S√∂yembik√§ Tower, which probably goes back to the reign of Peter the Great. A well-known legend connects the tower with the last queen of the Khanate of Kazan. Another recognizable architectural feature is the Spasskaya Tower, which anchors the southern end of the Kremlin and serves as the main entrance to the Kremlin. The Spasskaya Tower is named after the Spassky Monastery, which used to be located nearby. Among the monastery's buildings were the Church of St. Nicholas (1560s, four piers) and the Cathedral of the Saviour's Transfiguration (1590s, six piers). They were destroyed by the Communists during Joseph Stalin's rule. Also of interest are snow-white towers and walls, erected in the 16th and 17th centuries but later renovated; the Qol-≈û√§rif mosque, recently rebuilt inside the citadel; and the Governor's House (1843‚Äî53), designed by Konstantin Thon, now the Palace of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan. The Palace is believed to be located on the site of a former Khan's palace. Tucked between Presidential Palace and S√∂yembik√§ Tower is the palace church built on the foundation of a medieval mosque. The Northern wall of the Kremlin contains another gated tower, Secret Tower, so named because it used to house a secret water supply well. This tower allows pedestrian access to the Kremlin, but vehicle access is restricted to emergencies only. Image:Blagovesh.jpg Image:Nikola Kiprian.jpg Image:Kreml Ivanovskiy.jpg Recent events Monument to Tatar and Russian builders The opening of one of the biggest mosques in Europe, the Qol≈ü√§rif Mosque, was held in Kazan on June 24, 2005. Roughly 17,000 people gathered for the celebration. Delegations from forty countries attended the event. The facility was reconstructed on the site where presumably Kazan Khanate's principal mosque had been standing before 1552. Speaking at the ceremony, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaeymiev said \\"the Qol≈ü√§rif mosque is a new symbol of Kazan and Tatarstan... a bridge connecting... our past and future.\\" The decree on restoring the Qol≈ü√§rif mosque (1995) also ordered the restoration of the Annunciation Cathedral in the Kazan Kremlin which had been taken away from Orthodox Christians after the Russian Revolution. On July 21, 2005, the feast day of the holy icon \\"Theotokos of Kazan\\", in the presence of the crowd of 10,000 pilgrims, Patriarch Alexius II and Mintimer Shaeymiev placed at the newly restored Annunciation Cathedral the holiest copy of the long-lost icon, which had been returned to Russia in 2004 by Pope John Paul II shortly before his death. In 2005 the first stage of the Kazan Metro also included a station named Kremlyovskaya (or Kreml in Tatar), whose exits are right next to the Kremlin.

Charting the adventures of Dorian Hawkmoon, a version of the Eternal Champion, it takes place in a far- future version of Europe in which the insane rulers of the Dark Empire of Granbretan (the name given to what was once Great Britain) are engaged in conquering the continent. Written between 1967 and 1969, it is considered a classic of the genre, and has proven highly influential in shaping subsequent authors' works. A subsequent trilogy, The Chronicles of Castle Brass -- consisting of Count Brass, The Champion of Garathorm and The Quest for Tanelorn -- expand on the original saga, both deepening its characters (which in the original stories were a bit two-dimensional) and further linking them to the Moorcockian Multiverse. Dorian, in the final pages of the third book, happens to confront (along with other champions like Erekose) the malignant entity which used to reside in Elric's Stormbringer and which broke free at the tragic end of the albino prince's saga. The omnibus has also been published under the title Hawkmoon. Gollancz have announced plans to release all the Hawkmoon stories in both print omnibus and individual ebook form, starting in 2013.

The inhabitants of Granbretan are renowned for their cruelty, and for their practice of wearing masks at all times. The Granbretanian aristocracy, and the soldiers they lead, belong to the equivalent of chivalric orders, characterised by a totemic animal. The orders have their own secret languages and their animal-masks make their members resemble bipedal beasts. The post-apocalyptic world depicted, the apocalypse being referred to as the 'Tragic Millenium', has coexisting elements of both 'Medieval' (spears, swords, horse-based transport) and more advanced technology ('flame lances' (laser weapons) and ornithopters (flying machines powered by flapping wings)). The geopolitical situation depicted is in fact a curious reversal of that in the Second World War. The future Britain is a brutal empire, bent on the total conquest of Europe, its armies (pouring across a huge bridge spanning the Channel) overwhelming country after country and committing terrible atrocities wherever they come. Conversely, the protagonist Dorian Hawkmoon is a German (though having an English name), originally from K√∂ln, who is exiled by Granbretan's brutal conquest of his homeland but who fights on and rallies the Europeans' resistance to the conquerors.  Gods of Granbretan  The \\"terrifying ancient gods of Granbretan who were said to have ruled the land before the Tragic Millennium\\" are based on The Beatles: Jhone, Jhorg, Phowl and Rhunga.

Similar myths in the northern Celtic cultures include these of Annwn, Fairyland, Avalon and Hy Brasil.  Description, themes, and symbolism  T√≠r na n√ìg is depicted as an island paradise and supernatural realm of everlasting youth, beauty, health, abundance and joy.The Celts: history, life and culture, J. Koch general editor. Its inhabitants are described as the Tuatha D√© Danann or the warriors of the Tuatha D√©, the gods of pre-Christian Ireland, who engage in poetry, music, entertainment, and the feast of Goibniu, which grants immortality to the participants.The Book of Fermoy \\"The Fosterage off the House of the Two Pails\\" In the echtrae (adventure) and immram (voyage) tales, various Irish mythical heroes visit T√≠r na n√ìg after a voyage or an invitation from one of its residents. They reach it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by journeying through a mist, by going under water, or by travelling across the sea for three days on an enchanted boat or Manann√°n's horse. The tales of mortals who visit the Otherworld are referred to as echtrai (adventures) and baili (visions, ecstasies). The path across the sea is called Mag Mell (Plain of Honey). It is the golden path made by the sun on the ocean and to travel, \\"far over the green meadows of the waters where the horses of Lir have their pastures.\\" The god that rules this region is said to be the first ancestor of the human race and the god of the dead, and in the surviving tales is almost always named as Manann√°n mac Lir. In the tales, Manann√°n is usually described as a warrior and is sometimes accompanied by his golden-haired wife or daughter, who sometimes wears a golden helmet. T√≠r na n√ìg is described as a beautiful place (a forested wilderness or flowery meadow), but it is usually dangerous or hostile to human visitors (such as Ossian, Diarmuid, the Fianna, the King of Greece), who remain on the island for a period of time that is typically a multiple of three (three days or years). The women of T√≠r na n√ìg are very beautiful - and maybe the only residents - and sometimes leave to visit mortal men or otherwise establish a presence. There is a salmon-inhabited well or fountain in T√≠r na n√ìg that is found near an enormous tree or grove of nine hazels - or a lady's bower, \\"where bloom was on every bough, and the air heavy with the sweetness of orchards\\" and a lake area (perhaps Dulcinea). Typically an enormous tree lies at the centre of the island, and birds singing beautiful music in its branches are stated in the echtrai to be the souls of the dead. A drinking horn suspended near the well or an enchanted cup is also present in some of the tales along with a silver branch containing golden apples (perhaps even somewhere an enchanted herb and a false war). There are cities and fortresses made of precious metals and feather thatch in T√≠r na n√ìg, although their exact number is not clear. In some stories there is a multicoloured flowered plain full of bees in or underneath the forested wilderness of T√≠r na n√ìg and a parting \\"is sweet as honey\\" and maybe forever.

Rolleston's The High Deeds of Finn (1910) In the tale, Ois√≠n (a human hero) and Niamh (a woman of the Otherworld) fall in love. She brings him to T√≠r na n√ìg on a magical horse that can travel over water. After spending what seems to be three years there, Ois√≠n becomes homesick and wants to return to Ireland. Niamh reluctantly lets him return on the magical horse, but warns him never to touch the ground. When he returns, he finds that 300 years have passed in Ireland. Ois√≠n falls from the horse. He instantly becomes elderly, as the years catch up with him, and he quickly dies of old age.Monaghan, Patricia. The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore. Infobase Publishing, 2004. pp.358, 368 The story of Ois√≠n and Niamh bears a striking similarity to many other tales, including the Japanese tale of Urashima Tar≈ç. Another version concerns King Herla, a legendary king of the ancient Britons, who visited the Otherworld, only to return some two hundred years later after the lands had been settled by the Anglo-Saxons. The \\"Seven Sleepers of Ephesus\\", a group of Christian youths who hid inside a cave outside the city of Ephesus around 250, purportedly awoke approximately 180 years later during the reign of Theodosius II. = Ois√≠n in T√≠r na n√ìg = There is a king of T√≠r na n√ìg who held the crown for many years. The tradition of the land is that every seven years champions come to run against the king in order to rule. They run up a hill to a throne and the first person to sit on the throne becomes king until a champion replaces him. The king begins to fear that someone else will replace him as king. He visits a Druid and asks about his fate as a monarch. The Druid tells him that he will always be king unless his son-in law runs against him. Since the king's daughter is not yet married he decides to use the Druid's magic to turn his daughter's head into the head of a pig. The Druid then tells the king's daughter that she will get her own head back if she marries a son of Finn MacCumhail. The king's daughter finds one of the sons, Oisin, and tells him what the Druid told her. They marry and she transforms back into herself. They then go back to T√≠r na n√ìg and Oisin enters the challenge for the throne. He wins the throne and no one ever runs against him again. The princess is given a pig's head and pigs are a common symbol in Irish mythology. For the culture they were a vital meat source and they were smaller and fiercer than the modern domesticated pig. Early in Celtic culture, the pig was used as a funeral animal and pigs were an important aspect of trade between the Celts and Romans. They also represent a connection to the warrior class and are said to be good luck to the person who catches them. = Cormac's adventure in the Land of Promise = A grey-haired warrior visits King Cormac mac Airt carrying a silver branch with three golden apples that creates a soothing music. The warrior, later revealed to be Manann√°n mac Lir, is described as wearing a purple fringed mantle, a golden ribbed shirt, and white bronze shoes or sandals. When Cormac asks from what land Manann√°n has come, he responds that he comes from a land where there is no age or decay, falsehood, sadness, gloom, hatred, envy, or haughtiness. Cormac asks to make an alliance, and when Manann√°n agrees, he demands the branch, which Manann√°n gives him in exchange for three favours. Those favors later turn out to be Cormac's daughter, his son, and his wife. After Cormac's wife is taken, he follows her abductor, and is magically transported to a land in a heavy mist. The land is described as a vast plain containing two fortresses. The first fortress consists of a bronze wall with a white silver house thatched in white bird's wings; there are horseman stationed there and a man is constantly burning an oak fire. The other fortress consists of four silver houses thatched in white bird's wings with a bronze wall surrounding it. He enters the fortress and finds a palace made with bronze beams and silver wattle. Also in the fortress there is a shining fountain with five streams running from it; the fountain is surrounded by the nine purple hazels of Buan (an Ulster goddess).Hull, Eleanor. The Cuchullin Saga in Irish Literature (1898), p 94. The hazels drop their nuts into the fountains where five salmon eat them and send their husks down the five streams. The residents of the palace drink water from the fountain, and the sound of the cascading water is more melodious than any music known to man. When Cormac enters the palace, he meets a couple ‚Äì the warrior who has stolen his wife and a beautiful yellow-haired woman wearing a golden helmet, whose feet are being warmed or washed without anyone else being present. This time the warrior is described as having a beautiful shape, a comely form, and a wondrous countenance. A cook enters the palace with a log, an axe, and a pig, and begins to prepare a meal in a cauldron. Manann√°n tells the cook to turn the pig, but the cook responds that the pig will not cook until four truths have been told. The cook tells his tale first, recounting that he once stole cattle from a man, and when the man asked him to return them, he did so in exchange for the pig, the axe, and the wood he now carries; he has been cooking the same pig ever since. Then the warrior tells a tale of harvesting wheat, indicating that when the people of his land wished to plow, plant, and harvest the wheat, each step had been completed as soon as they desired it, and that they have been eating from that harvest ever since. The woman in the gold helmet then tells her story, saying that she has seven cows and seven sheep, and that the milk and wool they produce is enough for all the people in the Land of Promise. Then Cormac is asked to tell his truth, so he recounts his story with the silver branch up to the present. With the four truths told, the pig is ready and Cormac is served a portion. Cormac says he cannot eat without fifty men in his presence, so the warrior sings a song that puts Cormac to sleep and when he re-awakens, he finds fifty warriors along with his daughter, son, and wife. Then the warrior places an enchanted cup of intricate and unusual workmanship and tells Cormac that when three falsehoods are spoken it will break into three pieces and then when three truths are told, it can mend itself whole. The warrior then tells Cormac that his true name is Manann√°n son of Ler, and that his whole purpose was to bring him to the Land of Promise, but that after Cormac's death, all that he has returned to Cormac (his son, daughter, wife, and cup) will be returned to the Land of Promise. Manann√°n then explains what Cormac has witnessed. The horsemen at the first fortress are the ‚Äúmen of art‚Äù in Ireland who collect cattle and wealth that pass away into nothing. The man collecting and burning the oak wood is a young lord who pays for everything he consumes. The Fountain is the Fountain of Knowledge, and the five streams are the senses through which knowledge is obtained, and that no one has knowledge who does not drink from the fountain or its streams. Finally, as like the salmon, were the people Cormac saw at the Fountain of Knowledge. = The pursuit of the Gilla Decair and his horse = In the story of the Gilla Decair and His Horse, the Fianna follow the Gilla, a by-name of Manann√°n, across the sea to retrieve fifteen of their number who were taken to the Gilla's island on the back of his gigantic horse. Finn leads the Fianna to Ben-Edair, where the Tuatha D√© Danann made a solemn oath to the Gaels that if they were ever in a time of need to leave Ireland, ships would be provided. There, they encounter two heroic brothers, who offer to serve the Finn for a year and create a fleet of ships for transporting the Fianna across the sea. Finn and the remaining Fianna travel for three days until they spot an island with a sheer cliff and cylindrical rock perched atop it, where they pick up the Gilla's track. Dermot is then selected to scale the cliff (more slippery than an eel) because of his cowardly behavior and because he was raised on the Isle of Promise by Manann√°n and also taught by the Dagda's son Angus Og. Embarrassed by the scathing words of Fergus Truelips, Dermot grabs the two staves of Manann√°n and vaults onto the cliff. Once on the island, Dermot encounters a vast sylvan tract of dense forest where he is surrounded by the melodious sound of streams, wind, birds, and bees. In the midst of the forest, he crosses a plain and spots an immense tree with interlacing branches. Beside the tree there is a stone well topped by a pointed drinking horn. The water is pure, so Dermot stoops to drink it, and no sooner does he do so then folderol enters his head and a loud rumbling noise approaches him. When Dermot looks up, he encounters a wizard, who castigates Dermot for roaming through his forest and drinking his pure water. The two men come to blows and fight until dusk, when the wizard dives into the well. Dermot kills and eats a deer that evening, and when he awakes the next morning, the Dermot finds the wizard waiting for him; he upbraids Dermot for eating his deer, then the same episode from the previous day occurs (fighting until dusk when the wizard disappears into the well). On the third day, Dermot grabs onto the wizard when he leaps into the well, and finds himself on the other side. Dermot finds himself in a beautiful and flowery plane facing a regal city. He chases after the wizard through a multitude of people until he crosses through the city gate, and there, the gates are closed behind him, and he is attacked by the people of the city. He fights fiercely until his assailants flee further into the city and out into the forest, leaving Dermot broken in a pool of his own blood. A burly wizard then approaches Dermot and kicks him in the side. The burly wizard tells Dermot that he is in a dangerous place but will transport him to another location where he will sleep much better. The wizard takes Dermot on a long journey to another fortress, where Dermot is greeted by 150 men and their ladies as well as the lady of the fortress, who all greet him by name. At the wizard's fortress, Dermot is placed in an infirmary and completely healed with salves of herbs. Once healed, he engages with the company in feasting, drinking, and intelligent entertainment each night. After three nights, Dermot asks his host in what land he is, and who is in charge of it. The burly wizard tells Dermot he is in Tir fo thuinn and that the man with whom he battled is the Wizard of the Well who is the king of the land with whom he himself, the Wizard of Chivalry has a blood feud. Growing tired of waiting for Dermot, Finn and the Fianna scale the cliff, and on the same plane encounter a horseman who kisses Finn three times and asks the men to follow him to his fortress. There, the Fianna encounter an army and a well-armed keep and are entertained with feasting for three nights. After three days Finn asks about the land and its ruler and is told that he is in the land of Sorcha, and that his host is the king of that land. A female messenger then comes to the King of Sorcha and tells him that his island is being invaded by the Greeks. The Fianna and the King of Sorcha then sally out to meet the Greeks and slaughter them in great carnage. The King of Greece has a beautiful daughter who steals off to be with Finn. This upsets the Greek King more than the loss of his men, and declares that whoever can retrieve her will be given many precious things. A captain from his company explains that he has a magic branch that when waved releases beautiful music that will put people to sleep and promises to retrieve the King's daughter. He does so, and the Greeks return to Athens. The company splits up and some go to Greece to retrieve the King's daughter, while others meet the King of the Island, the Wizard of the Well, whose name is revealed to be Abartach son of Allchad. When confronted by the Fianna, Abartach asks Finn what he is owed, to which Finn requests single combat. Abartach indicates it is not in his interest to fight Finn, and requests what his wronged Fianna would like. Con√°n declares he wants fourteen women and Abartach's own wife to ride his horse back to Ireland. Abartach assents to this. The Fianna return to Ireland and have a wedding feast.

After his restoration in 2009, he resumed hearing cases at the Lahore High Court and eventually ascended as Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court in 2013. Career as Supreme court justice =Supreme Court of Pakistan= Justice Hamoodur Rahman served as a judge of the Dhaka High Court from 1954 until 1960 when he was appointed as Senior Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan by the President of Pakistan. In addition, Rahman served as the vice- chancellor of Dhaka University from 11 May 1958 until 14 December 1960 while serving as visiting professor of law at the Karachi University. During his career as Senior Justice at the Supreme Court, Rehman held various dignified positions and engaged himself in promoting the literacy across the country. From 1959 to 1960, he was a member of International Court of Arbitration that is based in the Hague, Netherlands. In 1964, Rehman, upon requested by the Ministry of Education (MoEd), led the \\"Commission on Students Problems and Welfare\\" as its chairman where he authored the report and submitted the case study recommendations to the Government of Pakistan in 1966. In 1967, he was the member of the \\"Law Reforms Commission\\" that conducted the various case studies on land reforms in Pakistan on behalf of Ministry of Law (MoL)‚Äì its report was submitted in 1970 to the President of Pakistan. =Chief Justice of Pakistan= In 1968, Senior Justice Hamoodur Rehman was nominated as Chief Justice by outgoing Chief Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius; his appointment as Chief Justice was approved by President Ayub Khan. His tenure witnessed the resignation of President Ayub Khan who invited Yahya Khan to take over the country through enforcing the martial law in 1969. He heard the petition filed by Asma Jillani against Yahya Khan's takeover in case known as \\"Asma Jillani vs. Government of the Punjab.\\" Upon hearing the case, Hamoodur Rahman court retroactively invalidated the martial law that suspended the Constitution and notably ruled that Yahya Khan's assumption of power was \\"illegal usurpation\\". The Supreme Court also over-ruled and overturned its convictions that called for validation of martial law in 1958. Chief Justice Hamoodur Rehman carefully distinguish the meaning of martial law in terms of controlling the internal disorder and imposing the martial law in alien territory. His stance stood firm against Yahya Khan's martial law but condone such actions by the application of doctrine of necessity. In 1970, he supported the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold the general elections held in 1970 across the country. =Bangladesh and 1971 war= Hamoodur Rahman, remained loyal to Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War and the war with India in 1971. He did not supported the independence of Bangladesh and remained quiet throughout the events. He administrated the oath of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as President of Pakistan in 1971 at the Supreme Court building. After the war In 1972‚Äì73, he went onto work with the United Nation and was a member of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice. Chief Justice Justice Hamoodur Rahman retired with state honours in 1975 and administrated the oath to appoint Senior Justice Muhammad Yaqub Ali as Chief Justice. In 1974, he was the chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) until retiring in 1977. War Enquiry Commission In 1971, President Zulfikar Bhutto constituted a commission to investigate the responsibility causes of the war with India that led the liberation of East Pakistan and to provide insightful recommendations to prevent future armed foreign intervention. The commission, known as War Enquiry Commission (or otherwise known as Hamoodur Rahman Commission), was led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rehman as its chairman and consisted of both civilian and military members. Initially, Chief Justice Rahman was tasked to investigate the causes and the break-up of Pakistan, and role of the Pakistan Armed Forces in the national politics. His report revealed many aspects of politics in Pakistan Armed Forces during the East-Pakistan war. Because of the nature of the findings, it was not declassified for decades until Indian newspapers, later Pakistani newspapers, published the details. =Fact finding and recommendations= From 1971 until 1975, the Commission led by Rahman conducted several interviews of Pakistan military's senior officers, bureaucrats, politicians, activists, and the Bengali nationalists. Criticism on the government and misconduct of civilian politicians were very heavy and intense, therefore, the Report was never made it public in Pakistan and concealed all of its information as the report was marked as \\"Top secret\\". The report explores a number of issues such as, killing of thousands of East Pakistanis‚Äîboth civilians and \\"Bengali\\" soldiers‚Äîrape, pan smuggling, looting of banks in East Pakistan, drunkenness by military officers, even an instance of a one star rank officer \\"entertaining\\" women while their troops were being shelled by Indian troops. The Report recommended a string of courts-martial and military trials against the top senior military officers including the PAF's Air Marshal Enamul Haq (the AOC of Eastern Air Command of Pakistan Air Force), Vice-Admiral Mohammad Shariff (Fleet Commander of the Eastern Naval Command of Pakistan Navy), and Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan (the GOC of Eastern Army Command of Pakistan Army), and former generals such as Amir Khan Niazi and Rao Farman Ali. Despite recommending field courts-martial by the commission, there were no actions taken by Prime Minister Bhutto or the successive governments. Nearly 300 individuals were interviewed and hundreds of classified armed forces military signals were examined, with the final comprehensive Report was submitted on 23 October 1974 by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman who submitted the report to Prime minister Secretariat. =Rehman on \\"Separation\\"= Originally, the commission was to overlook the military failure to prevent the break‚Äìup of Eastern Pakistan but Chief Justice Rahman went into great depths in the roots of matter since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. A separate chapter on the political history of Pakistan was very detailed oriented and written by Chief Justice Rahman who critically opined on the political role of Zulfikar Bhutto. Rahman critically opined on Bhutto and, with some degree, implicated Bhutto of manipulating President Yahya Khan to take the military action as a solution. He noted that President Yahya Khan failed to seek a sincere political settlement with East Pakistan. Though the responsibility of the debacle lay on the shoulders of the people in power then as was recommended in the report by Chief Justice Rahman. When the report was submitted the then Prime Minister Bhutto, the Prime minister wrote to the chairman War Enquiry Commission Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, that the commission has exceeded its limits. The commission was appointed to look into the military \\"aspect of debacle\\", not the aspect of political failure; therefore, Bhutto classified the publications of the commission and marked its report as \\"Top Secret\\". =Fate of the Report= In 1974, the final Report was submitted but both Bhutto and President Zia-ul-Haq claimed that the report was lost and was nowhere to be located in the National Archives of Pakistan. In the 1990s, it was revealed through investigative journalism by News International that the Report was suppressed and was held secretly at the Joint staff HQ in Rawalpindi. In 2000, portion of the Report was leaked equally by the India Today and the Dawn. However, the India Today wilfully suppressed its own publications as if the surrender was its own scandal. Death and legacy Hamoodur Rahman lived a very quiet life in Lahore and remained active in the Supreme Court. He was appointed the Chairman of Islamic Ideology after his retirement for 3 years, later he was appointed as an advisor to the President of Pakistan on constitutional affairs. He also conducted a commission on election reforms and proposed the proportional representation system existing in Germany, Sri Lanka and many other countries. In which it can be accessed via the library to publish judicial supplements. He died in Lahore due to a cardiac arrest on 20 December 1981. He was buried in Lahore with close judicial associates and friends attending his funeral. Chief Justice Rahman remained very respected in Pakistan's judiciary even after his death, and is hailed for his honesty and patriotism that Senior Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday once publicly noted that \\"his Commission was the most honorable commission that was investigated by a Bengali Chief Justice, in spite of East-Pakistan disaster\\", in 2010.

Born around 1780, his father was Ndvungunye (also known as Zikodze), and his mother was Somnjalose Simelane. He was called Somhlolo, \\"the Wonder,\\" upon his birth because his father Ndvungunye died as a result of being struck by lightning. When Sobhuza was king, Lojiba Simelane instead of his mother Somnjalose was Queen Mother because Somnjalose was an inhlanti or support bride to Lojiba. Somhlolo is a greatly revered king of Eswatini. He had his first royal capital or kraal at Zombodze in the Shiselweni region, but moved it north to new Zombodze in central Eswatini. Swazis celebrate Somhlolo Day every September 6 as their Independence Day and the national stadium is named Somhlolo stadium. Sobhuza was succeeded by his son Mswati II and his wife Tsandzile Ndwandwe as Queen Mother after a short regency by Queen Lojiba Simelane. Sobhuza by the time of his death a conquered a country claimed to be reaching modern day Barberton in the north, Carolina in the west, Pongola River in the south and Lubombo Mountains in the east. Background Sobhuza's mother Somnjalose was the younger sister and inhlanti co-wife to her elder sister Lojiba Simelane, Ndvungunye's senior wife. Lojiba had no male children herself. Sobhuza, as son of her sister co-wife, was considered Lojiba's classificatory son under Ngwane royal kinship and succession principles. While Sobhuza thus became Ndvungunye's heir and successor, Lojiba rather than Somnjalose became Indlovukati or Queen Mother upon his accession. Kingship The reign of Sobhuza I marked a crucial phase in the history of Eswatini. As Sobhuza began his reign, KaNgwane was a realm centered in territory along the Pongola River to the south of modern Swaziland, whose northern reaches encompassed today's southern Swaziland. KaNgwane was ruled by kings of the Dlamini clan, who had earlier ruled an area in and around the Lubombo Mountains to the east. It was only under Sobhuza's grandfather, Ngwane III, ca. 1750, that the Dlamini kings conquered and established the country Sobhuza inherited, incorporating more than a dozen smaller chiefdoms led by chiefs from other clans. Early in Sobhuza's reign, the Ngwane kingdom faced strong risks of conquest by the more powerful Ndwandwe and Zulu kingdoms to the south in the 1810s and 1820s. Sobhuza moved the main royal center northward into what is now Zombodze central Eswatini, with many of his followers relocating as well. The former royal centers in Shiselweni became southern outposts. After moving the center of Dlamini royal power to the north, Sobhuza led the conquest of many local chiefdoms. KaNgwane became a kingdom comparable in scope and power to those of the Zulu, the Maroti kingdom, or the Pedi. Sobhuza I notably married inkhosikati Tsandzile Ndwandwe the daughter of Zwide Ndwandwe the leader of the powerful Ndwandwe clan south of the Pongola River. The Swazi clans under the leadership of Sobhuza I were constantly in conflict with the Ndwandwe‚Äôs. As a result, Sobhuza made an offer to marry one of the daughters of Zwide and establish peace with his neighbours. Sobhuza I had in total three wives, the first of whom, Tsandzile, bore him Mswati II and Mzamose Dlamini. Mswati would eventually succeed him as king.  Later life  Sobhuza died in 1836 and is buried at the royal burial site at Mbilaneni. Sobhuza left his son Mswati II a country claimed to be reaching modern day Barberton in the north, Carolina in the west, Pongola River in the south and Lubombo Mountains in the east, which is larger than present day Eswatini. The clans that were conquered before and during Sobhuza's tenure are referred to as Emakhandzambili.

Owned and operated by Bell Media, it broadcasts with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 41,400 watts as a Class C1 station, using an omnidirectional antenna from the Mount Royal candelabra tower at 297.4 metres in height above average terrain (HAAT). Its studios and offices are located at the Bell Media Building at 1717 Rene-Levesque Boulevard East in Downtown Montreal. The station airs a Hot Adult Contemporary radio format and is the flagship station of the √ânergie network, which operates across Quebec. It offers personality DJs playing francophone and anglophone hits from the current charts to the 1980s. History =CJMS-FM (1964‚Äì1971)= The station signed on the air on May 11, 1964, as CJMS-FM. It was a sister station to the now-defunct CJMS. Both stations were owned by the Radiomutuel Group. After first simulcasting the AM station, CJMS-FM later aired a classical music format. Classical music ended in 1970 and the call sign was changed to CKMF-FM on May 1, 1971, airing an automated Top 40 (CHR) format. =Early CKMF years (1971‚Äì1994)= The station moved in 1972 from its original facility at 1700 Berri Street in the Quartier Latin to 225 Roy Street East in the Plateau. In November 1978, the station became Canada's first radio station with a disco music dedicated segment, heard most evenings (although Broadcasting Yearbook listed the station's full-time format as Disco). Because of Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rules and the fact that CKMF is a French-language station, it was required to play mostly French- language songs. Therefore, English songs (mostly the disco tracks) were spread thinly across the broadcast schedule. The DJ who spun disco music for the first time on Montreal FM Radio was Robert (Bob) Ostiguy during his Saturday night dance show Style Libre (Free Style), heard from 1974 to 1976. Later on, Michel Trahan began to include disco music during his afternoon drive time show. \\"Le 5 √† 8\\" became CKMF's most popular show between 1978 and 1986. CKMF concentrated its CRTC quota of English and International music (mostly disco) between the hours of 5-8PM. \\"Le 5 √† 8\\" was hosted by Michel Jasmin and Alain Tanguay, and later by Alain Montpetit and Guy Aubry. The show featured the best disco DJs in Montreal including Fran√ßois L'Herbier, Alain Bourque, Big Dan Moreau and Michel Cadoch, doing shows like \\"Live from the Limelight\\" and other famous clubs in Montreal. Programs like \\"Le Show A Mario,\\" with Mario Lirette and DJ Michel Cadoch, gave CKMF 94.3 a unique sound for the Disco era. One of the station's biggest on-air personalities of the disco era was the openly gay Douglas Coco Leopold, whose trademark was his local trendsetting lists of who and what was \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" of fashion. As was fictionalised in the 2010 Canadian film Funkytown, Montpetit's popularity as an influential DJ and promoter was tarnished by being named as the prime suspect in the 1982 murder of a model in New York City (which would not be confirmed until 2002), and would prompt Leopold to criticize fellow airstaffer Montpetit on air publicly. In 1987, Montpetit died of a drug overdose in Washington, DC, just months after station management fired him after he showed up drunk and appeared too incoherent to do an air shift. The station relocated for a final time in 1981 to its current building at 1717 Rene-Levesque Boulevard East (then named Dorchester Boulevard). Its sister station CJMS also moved to the Dorchester/Rene-Levesque building. The move reunited the two stations in the same facility for the first time in a decade as CJMS had never relocated to Roy Street in the 1970s and had instead stayed on Berri ever since. =Radio √ânergie and the Astral Takeover (1994‚Äì2009)= Last CKMF logo using the √ânergie branding before conversion to NRJ. The √ânergie name began to be used as CKMF transitioned from Rhythmic Top 40 in the 1980s and 1990s, to mainstream Top 40, which began in 1994. In January 2000, Astral Media acquired the assets of Radiomutuel including CKMF. When fourth-adjacent 95.1 CBF-FM increased its power to 100,000 watts (from 17,030 watts), CKMF planned its own a power increase to 75,000 watts. But the boost in power never took place as the expected interference from CBF-FM did not happen. However this plan was notified internationally, which explains why the United States Federal Communications Commission's FM Query webpage erroneous claims that CKMF-FM has a power of 75,000 watts. =From √ânergie to NRJ and back again (2009-present)= CKMF logo as NRJ. The √ânergie branding was discarded in August 2009 when Astral Media licensed the NRJ branding from a European broadcaster. CKMF's last song as \\"√ânergie\\" was Pictures Of You by The Last Goodnight, seguing to the station's morning show as the station relaunched as \\"NRJ.\\" The first song under the \\"NRJ\\" moniker was Beggin' by Madcon. In 2010, the station became the French-language radio flagship of the Montreal Alouettes CFL football team. The contract was supposed to last until 2013. Both parties were apparently satisfied at the end of the 2010 season. But the contract was terminated as the Alouettes returned to 730 CKAC in time for the 2011 season. With the merger of Astral and Bell Media on July 5, 2013, CKMF, as well as all \\"NRJ\\" stations in Quebec, came under Bell Media ownership. By 2011, CKMF began moving away from Top 40/CHR to Adult Top 40 with an emphasis on modern adult contemporary material, which would later evolve into a straight-ahead modern rock presentation by late 2014. Due to its high cost, Bell Media didn't renew the \\"NRJ\\" branding, and on August 24, 2015, all Quebec \\"NRJ\\" stations were rebranded back to the \\"√ânergie\\" moniker, including CKMF. However, CKMF continued the modern rock format, whereas the other \\"√ânergie\\" stations remained Adult Top 40. In March 2016, CKMF shifted to Hot Adult Contemporary, while retaining the \\"√ânergie\\" branding, putting it in line with the √ânergie stations in other parts of Quebec. Its programming is simulcast in all √ânergie stations evenings, overnights and weekend mornings.

It was intended to promote tourism and the economy in the region of Graub√ºnden, The project was put on hold as uneconomical in 2007, and then indefinitely shelved in 2012. The current multifunction station is only used for emergency stops and maintenance. The portal lies above the tunnel. Design Portal over the Anterior Rhine Access to the shafts Porta Alpina would have been by far the deepest underground train station in the world at underground, outclassing Arsenalna Metro station at . It would also have connected the high-Alpine village of Sedrun and the Surselva to a major high-speed line from northern to southern Europe. The current station, along with Faido, is one of the two multi-function stations of the tunnel. The multifunction station is located near a crossover between the northbound and southbound tunnels and is linked to the surface by an elevator, using tall shafts and a long access tunnel, exiting over the Anterior Rhine, south of Sedrun. This access was used for the construction of the tunnel and is now an emergency exit of the tunnel. Construction costs for a fully functional passenger station were estimated at CHF 50M ($39M, ‚Ç¨32M, or ¬£22M) in 2005 with annual operating costs of CHF 2.5M. It was initially projected to be opened in 2016 after the Base Tunnel was scheduled to come into service. Project history Proponents of Porta Alpina viewed it both as a potential tourist attraction in its own right, and as a useful transport link to assist the economically challenged Graub√ºnden region. The station would have connected the North/South Gotthard railway line with the East/West Rhaetian Railway/Matterhorn-Gotthard Railway, which would link to the elevator by means of local buses to Sedrun station (MGB) and Disentis station (RhB). This was to have been the fastest public transport link between Z√ºrich and the canton of Graub√ºnden. Surface works for the tunnel at Sedrun. The project was initially positively received, and the Swiss parliament approved CHF 7.5M of startup funding in 2005. However, further studies indicated substantial problems including the questionable feasibility of the elevators, the negative impact on tunnel rail capacity and the unprofitability of the whole enterprise. The Swiss Federal Council and the government of the canton of Graub√ºnden announced in September 2007 that the project was put on indefinite hold. Following renewed interest by private investors in 2012, the Federal Council decided to forgo construction for the time being, while leaving open the possibility of a similar project being implemented by a later generation. A government report stated that the Porta Alpina would have reduced the base tunnel's freight capacity (unless a passing loop were built, at a large cost for additional tunnelling) and would have been uneconomical to operate, requiring CHF 9M of annual public subsidies.

The film, set in Zanzibar and German East Africa in 1913‚Äì1915, is based on a novel by Wilbur Smith which is very loosely inspired by real events (see the sinking of the SMS K√∂nigsberg). The supporting cast features Barbara Parkins and Ian Holm. Plot summary Colonel Flynn O'Flynn (Lee Marvin), a hard-drinking American, manipulates British aristocrat Sebastian Oldsmith (Roger Moore) into helping poach ivory in Tanganyika, which is part of the German-controlled pre-World War I territory of German East Africa. On hearing news that the American has returned, Herman Fleischer, the local German Commander of the Southern Provinces, relentlessly hunts O'Flynn with his Schutztruppen (colonial troops). Later Sebastian meets and falls in love with O'Flynn's daughter, Rosa (Barbara Parkins). They are married and have a daughter together. Meanwhile, the poaching continues. Fleischer has his warship ram and sink O'Flynn's Arab dhow loaded with poached ivory. Later, while attacking O'Flynn's home, Schutztruppe under Fleischer's command kill Sebastian's daughter Maria. O'Flynn and Sebastian decide to go and kill Fleischer as revenge for the death of the little girl. But when it is discovered that Britain is at war with Germany, allied officers convince O'Flynn to locate and destroy the German warship awaiting repair. O'Flynn, Sebastian, and Rosa pursue Fleischer, who happens to be on the warship. Eventually they find her in an inlet and plant a bomb on board. O'Flynn sacrifices himself so that Sebastian and Rosa can escape while Fleischer's crew search for the bomb. Fleischer jumps overboard just in time to get away also, but as he comes ashore, Sebastian kills him with a rifle. Sebastian and Rosa then watch the ship as it is ripped apart by more explosions and burns.

In the film the German ship is named Bl√ºcher; there was a vessel of this name, but it did not serve in Africa. The film implies that Portugal became a co-belligerent with Britain against Germany when the First World War broke out in August 1914, as the Portuguese supply O'Flynn and Oldsmith with a marked Portuguese plane with a Portuguese pilot to conduct surveillance in German territory. In reality, the Portuguese would not have allowed this as they remained neutral until 1916. Although the motives for killing Fleischer are personal, Sebastian Oldsmith is in fact the only major character who is a citizen of a nation actually at war with Germany. Production =Development= Film rights were bought by Michael Klinger, who would also buy the rights to Gold Mine, The Sun Bird, The Eye of the Tiger and Eagle in the Sky. Poor-quality text, probably OCR. It was announced in 1969 that the movie version would be made by Cinerama Inc. but it took a number of years for the adaptation to be financed. In 1971 Smith wrote to Klinger that, \\"It is now becoming critical that somebody start making films out of my books. This is essential for my career ‚Äì which really needs a good film to take off in the Alistair MacLean class.\\" Klinger was highly enthusiastic about Shout at the Devil ‚Äì his son referred to it as his father's equivalent of Gone with the Wind. The producer himself called it a combination between The African Queen and The Guns of Navarone. However it was an expensive film to produce. Klinger decided to first make a film of Smith's novel Gold Mine. =Screenplay= Smith worked on the script with Stanley Price, who also helped adapt Smith's novel Gold Mine for Michael Klinger. However, the film ending was changed; in the novel all three main characters die. =Filming= The film's budget has been reported as $9‚Äì10 million. Klinger said $3.5 million was provided by AIP. The film was shot on location in Malta and ‚Äì controversially due to the then apartheid regime ‚Äì in South Africa. Shooting took 15 weeks and began in March 1975. The South African portion of the film was based out of the town of Port St Johns.Roy Moseley, Roger Moore: A Biography, 1985 p 220-221 Stars Roger Moore and Lee Marvin got along well. \\"They were very funny and liked each other a great deal\\", said director Peter Hunt. \\"They would socialise and get drunk together in the evenings, although they never had thick heads in the morning.\\" \\"I love this gentleman\\", said Moore about Marvin. \\"Thanks to him I have given my best performance ever. I can only be as good as the other guy. Working with Lee Marvin hauls you up, forces you to try to reach his level.\\" The movie was cut during post production with around 50 minutes cut out. =Soundtrack= The music was composed by Maurice Jarre. Reception =Box office= The film was one of the most successful British films of 1976 grossing ¬£15 million. =Critical= Critic Richard Eder did not like the film much. He wrote, \\"The movie has too much plot. All that action, conducted by characters without character‚Äîexcept for Fleischer, whose childlike joy in hurting people is almost appealing‚Äîproduces lethargy...the movie is a passable midget in absurdly long pants.\\" Film critic Roger Ebert thought that \\"Shout at the Devil is a big, dumb, silly movie that's impossible to dislike. It's so cheerfully corny, so willing to involve its heroes in every possible predicament, that after a while we relax: This is the kind of movie they used to make, back when audiences were supposed to have the mentality of a 12-year-old. It's great to be 12 again.\\" Follow ups Klinger had the film rights to other Smith novels, The Sunbird, Eagle in the Sky and The Eye of the Tiger. Eagle and Eye of the Tiger were meant to be part of a four-picture deal between Klinger and Rank Productions. However none were ever made. The relationship between Smith and Klinger, once warm, ultimately ended in litigation.

He was the US delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and was elected to Congress from The Bronx. Early life Bingham was born in New Haven, Connecticut. His father, Hiram Bingham III, was a Senator and explorer and his great grandfather, Hiram Bingham I, was a missionary, who helped translate the Bible into Hawaiian. Bingham attended Hamden Hall Country Day School and Groton School and graduated from Yale University in 1936 with a BA and from Yale Law School in 1939 with a law degree. He was a member of Skull and Bones, class of 1936.Alexandra Robbins, Secrets of the Tomb: Skull and Bones, the Ivy League, and the Hidden Paths of Power, Little, Brown and Company, 2002, p. 165 In 1940 he was admitted to the bar, and began the practice of law in New York City. His practice was interrupted in August 1941, when he joined the Machinery Branch of the newly created Office of Price Administration (OPA) as a legal advisor. He was not at the OPA for long, for in 1942 he joined the Military Intelligence Service. In April of the following year he was enlisted as a private in the United States Army and was discharged a captain in October 1945 with a War Department citation. Diplomat On his return he was appointed chief of the newly created Alien Enemy Control Section of the State Department. The Alien Enemy Control Section was unpopular and short-lived. Bingham got off the boat before it sank, resuming the practice of law in New York City in 1946. He left the practice of law again in 1951 to become assistant director of the Office of International Security Affairs. Bingham left in the same year to become deputy administrator of the Technical Cooperation Administration, implementing the Point 4 Program of technical assistance to developing countries. His book, Shirt-Sleeve Diplomacy: Point 4 in Action, was published in 1953. He left the administration in that year and resumed the practice of law. In 1955 he became secretary to fellow Bonesman, W. Averell Harriman, while he was Governor of New York. When Harriman was defeated in the 1958 election by Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, Bingham joined the law firm Goldwater & Flynn. In 1961 Bingham entered the world of diplomacy, as a United States representative on the United Nations Trusteeship Council with rank of Minister in 1961 and 1962, serving as President in 1962. During this period he was also principal adviser to the U.S. ambassador to U.N. on colonial and trusteeship questions. From 1963 to 1964 he was a United States representative on the United Nations Economic and Social Council with rank of Ambassador. He was also alternate representative to the 15th and 18th United Nations General Assemblies. Congress In 1964 he was elected to the House of Representatives from the 23rd District of New York, a district in the Bronx, at a time when elections in the Bronx were decided in the Democratic primaries in contests between \\"regular\\" or machine Democrats, and \\"reform\\" or challenger Democrats. Bingham defeated Charles Buckley, the leader of the Bronx \\"regular\\" Democrats and a powerful, senior committee chairman in Congress, in a rematch following Bingham's defeat in his first try against the incumbent Buckley in the 1962 Democratic primary. Bingham represented the 23rd District from January 3, 1965 until January 3, 1973, when, as a result of redistricting following the 1970 census, he was elected to the House from the 22nd District of New York following a bruising primary with neighboring Democratic incumbent congressman James H. Scheuer. He served the 22nd District from January 3, 1973 until January 3, 1983, but did not pursue reelection when, in 1982, his district essentially disappeared as a result of another post-census redistricting. In the House, Bingham served on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade. He was particularly dedicated to nuclear non- proliferation and environmental protection. Bingham was instrumental in supporting aid to Romania following the Vrancea earthquake in March 1977, sponsoring a bill to provide $20 million in assistance to the country.

Owned by the Cherokee Chief James Vann, the Vann House is a Georgia Historic Site on the National Register of Historic Places and one of the oldest remaining structures in the northern third of the state of Georgia. It is located in Murray County, on the outskirts of Chatsworth in northwest Georgia, which has a commanding view of the land around it and of the Cohutta Mountains, about to the east.  Construction of the Vann House  When James Vann was rising to become the wealthiest businessman and chief in the Cherokee Nation, he decided to build a two-story brick house which would reflect his status. He brought in professional architects for its design. In addition to providing an education to local Cherokees, the Moravians contributed to the building. In July 1803, a man named Vogt (perhaps James Vann's brother-in-law Charles Vogt), and Dr. Henry Chandlee Forman, arrived to begin construction. Construction started in late 1803 and completed early in 1804. Both the exterior walls (which are around eighteen inches thick) and the interior walls (about eight inches thick) are solid brick. These bricks came from the red clay located on the Spring Place Plantation (Vann House) property. The handwrought nails and hinges used in construction came from Vann's blacksmith shop. Only the interior walls of the third floor are plaster on wood. The lead brick mason of this house, Robert Henry Howell, was born in Virginia and died in 1834. He is buried at the nearby Moravian cemetery in Spring Place, Georgia. He also built the McNair house and the foundation of the Hildebrand house. The house is a combination of late Federal-style architecture and early Georgian style. It has two full stories with a third half story: the ceilings of both the first and second floor stand at twelve feet, while the roof of the third floor stands at only six feet. The first and second floors have the standard three rooms. On both levels, there is a room to the east, to the west, and a hallway dividing the two. On the first level, the dining room is to the east, while the west room is the drawing-room, more commonly referred to as a family or living room. On the second floor, the east room is the master bedroom, and the west room is the guest bedroom. Only the third floor, which operated as storage space during James's life and then as children's rooms during Joseph's life, strays from this typical design. Climbing the stairs to the third floor and you can see two rooms. The room the stairway leads into on the third floor is believed to have served as the boys' room. This room is two-thirds the width of the home and has two closets cut into its walls. The second room on the third floor is the girls'. It is only one-third the width of the home; however, this room could be shut off from the boys' room, giving the girls more privacy. The Vann House also features a basement with two separate rooms, one of which served as a wine cellar. The other is assumed to have been a chamber for misbehaving slaves, to whom James Vann was known to be exceptionally cruel. Decorated in red, blue, green, and yellow, the interior of the home is a timeless masterpiece. White is used throughout the house but only as a filler color. There are two possible reasons for these four colors in the home. The first possibility is that these four colors represent different elements of nature. Red represents the Georgia red clay, blue represents the sky, green represents the trees and grass, and yellow represents the wheat and corn of the harvest. The second possibility is that these four colors are part of Federal-style colors. These colors are popular in other homes of the late 1700s and early 1800s. The difference between the use of these colors in the Vann House versus other dwellings of the time is color distribution. Most homes of the Federal period would concentrate colors in one room, giving a house a red room, blue room, etc. However, in the Vann House, the colors have been mixed in almost every room, which gives a multi- color appearance. This color scheme is present on the mantels, doorjambs, and wainscottings, all of which are original to the house. The house's doors, known as Christian doors, are of particular interest. Their details feature a cross and an open Bible. In addition to the blacksmith shop, the grounds contained 42 slave cabins, 6 barns, five smokehouses, a trading post, more than 1,000 peach trees, 147 apple trees, and a still. After constructing the Vann House, James lived in it for five years before his murder at Buffington's Tavern in 1809. After his death, his favorite child, Rich Joe Vann, neither his youngest nor eldest child, inherited the house. Chief Joseph \\"Rich Joe\\" Vann. Rich Joe's Vann House After Rich Joe's father died, he made improvements and changes to the new house. After Rich Joe took control of the home, he commissioned and paid for decorating the house between 1809 and 1818. Rich Joe hired a father and son construction crew for this work. In 1818, John McCartney and his son James arrived at the Vann House and began their work. The McCartneys added all of the current woodwork in the house, including ionic columns. They also built the house's most unusual piece of architecture, a floating staircase in the hallway of the third floor. It is said to be \\"floating\\" or \\"hanging,\\" because the second landing of the stairs sits over the first-floor hall with no visible supports, with the illusion that the landing is hanging or floating in midair. The Vann stairway is one of the oldest examples of cantilevered construction in Georgia. On one side of the main entrance, which initially faced the Federal Road, and works as a set of scales for weight distribution. The staircase, suspended over the first-floor hallway, roughly six inches of the opposite side of the stairway, is in a solid brick wall. The brick wall is far denser than the second landing; this means there will never be enough weight on the landing to \\"tip the scale.\\" In 1819, President James Monroe and his three men were on a trip from Augusta to Nashville. They intended to spend the night in the Spartan Moravian mission at Spring Place. Instead, President Monroe went to a nearby location, The Vann House, which he found more comfortable than the mission, so he asked Rich Joe permission to spend the night. Rich Joe was 20 years old when he met President Monroe.  Eviction of Rich Joe and seizure of Vann House  Burn marks on the Vann House's stairs where Colonel Bishop placed a smoldering log in an attempt to smoke out Spencer Riley. After the Georgia Gold Rush, Rich Joe hired a white man, a Mr. Howel,\\"Memorial of Protest of the Cherokee Nation\\" as included in The Cherokee Removal by Theda Perdue. to run Vann House. Although he never actually worked for Vann, the Cherokee had unknowingly violated a new Georgia law forbidding whites from working for Cherokees without a permit. Leading up to the Cherokee Trail of Tears, Rich Joe and his family were caught amid the struggle between two opposing claims for the house. Colonel William Bishop and the infamous Georgia Guard tried to take over the house on the grounds of his hiring a white man without a permit. Spencer Riley, who claimed to have won the house in the Land Lottery of 1832, known as the Sixth Georgia Land Lottery, claimed the house at the same time. Colonel Bishop then evicted Rich Joe. Colonel Bishop used the house as his local headquarters and permitted his brother, Absalom Bishop, to live there. Riley then took action on his claim and settled in the house. To get rid of Riley, Bishop took a smoldering log and threw it on the cantilevered steps to smoke him out, causing some damage to the house. This action had its intended effect, and Bishop's brother returned to the home. Although Vann and his family lost their home and property, he later sued for the loss and was awarded $19,605 by the government as compensation. Which was nearly double it's the value of $10,000 at the time. The compensation was far from the actual property value. In November of that year, Colonel Bishop imprisoned John Howard Payne for 13 days on the grounds of the house. Payne noted as a composer of \\"Home, Sweet Home\\", had been charged with sedition for supporting the claims of the Cherokee over the state of Georgia. Restoration of the Vann House The Vann Plantation Rich Joe and his family were finally forced out of the house in March 1835 and moved to Webbers Falls, Oklahoma by following the Trail of Tears. They never returned to Georgia or their house. Over the years, the Vann House has had seventeen different owners. In 1952, J. E. Bradford, a physician who had purchased it in 1920, sold the house to the Georgia Historical Commission and the State of Georgia. In such a severe state of disrepair that the roof had come off, the elements were taking their toll. One of the owners had added a room after Rich Joe left Georgia. A restoration project began in 1958. It took six years to complete and included demolishing this additional room that was not present in the original house. Also, repainting the home according to its classic color scheme. Today it is administered by the Parks, Recreation, and Historic Sites division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.  Robert E. Chambers Interpretive Center  The State of Georgia, Cherokees, and the State of Oklahoma, as well as other supporters, donated to build a newly designed museum called the \\"Robert E. Chambers Interpretive Center\\" in 1999, next to the Vann House. It was opened on July 27, 2002, to honor the Cherokee people and their history. The new center also highlights the lives of Chiefs James and Joseph Vann, as well as featuring the history of the Cherokee Nation over the past 200 years, including the infamous Trail of Tears. Robert E. Chambers was named for supporting the Cherokee, as he was native businessman of Chatsworth.

It is home to the Missouri State Bears football team. History The stadium was built in 1941 as SMS Stadium, a Works Progress Administration project at a cost of only $60,000, before World War II broke out. Its original seating capacity was 8,500. In 1970 it was renamed Briggs Stadium after Arthur Briggs, the school's all-time winningest coach. =Renovations= In 1991, the stadium was renamed the Plaster Sports Complex in honor of Robert W. Plaster, chairman of Evergreen Investments of Lebanon, Missouri. Mr. Plaster donated funds for major renovations of the stadium, including expansion of the stadium to its current capacity, including the addition of an upper deck which seats 8,500, 24 luxury suites holding 10 each, a 40-seat luxury box and a new press box. In addition, a new running track and new artificial turf were installed. The artificial turf was replaced in 2001 with a FieldTurf surface and in 2006 a new FieldTurf surface was installed. A new scoreboard was added in 2008. It was determined that at the conclusion of the 2013 football season, the aging student (East) bleachers would be torn down. After the student body passed the B.E.A.R. Fee, money was in place to rebuild the student section (East) side. The stadium renovation also included the removal of the track as well as the re-positioning of the field with a new Sport Turf playing surface. Robert W. Plaster Stadium also includes 12 American handball/racquetball courts, including two courts with spectator seating. The complex also features Health and Fitness, and Athletics Strength and Conditioning centers on the second level of the stadium. High school football For many years Plaster Stadium held many of the annual Missouri State High School Activities Association state football championship games. In 1996 all games were moved to the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis, where they remained through 2015. Following the Rams' move back to Los Angeles in January 2016, the MSHSAA voted to return the games to Plaster Field in 2016 and Faurot Field at the University of Missouri in Columbia in 2017.

The city remained largely Christian until the Crusades, its bishop maintaining close ties to the Byzantine Empire. After the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by the crusaders, the see was transformed into a Latin archdiocese, subordinate to the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem. History The diocese was an ancient one, established in one of the first Christian communities ever created: it was due to the work of St Peter and St Paul. Records of the community are dated as far back as the 2nd century. According to the Apostolic Constitutions (7.46), the first Bishop of Caesarea was Zacchaeus the Publican. Caesarea Maritima was the capital of Roman Iudaea province and after the Bar Kokhba revolt it was the metropolis of the diocese of Palaestina Prima. Until the establishment of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, it was subject to the patriarch of Antioch. The most notable bishop of Caesarea was Eusebius of Caesarea, also known as Eusebius Pamphili. The Library of Caesarea Maritima established by Pamphilus of Caesarea remained in existence until the Arabs invaded Palestine in the 7th century. The diocese suffered a troubled history following the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 7th century. The city was raided by the Sassanid Persians in the early 7th century. Following the conquest of the Holy Land by the Islamic armies in the 630s, the diocese and city suffered tremendously and steadily declined in size and importance. It was finally conquered in 640 following a protracted siege. Nonetheless, it remained overwhelmingly Christian, and in the absence of imperial oversight, its independence increased and the archbishop became the effective ruler of the area. By the 9th century there was a substantial colony of Frankish settlers established by Emperor Charlemagne to facilitate Christian pilgrimages. However, by the 10th century, as periodic Islamic persecution continued and the aura of Byzantine Imperial authority made a resurgence, the diocese fell under the influence of the patriarch of Constantinople for protection and supervision and increasingly fell under Byzantine authority. St Pamphilus of Caesarea devoted his life to searching out and obtaining ancient texts which he collected in the Library of Caesarea Maritima that Jerome was later to use, and established a school for theological study.Eusebius of Caesarea, \\"Ecclesiastical History,\\" VII.xxxii.25. In the scriptorium, a necessary adjunct to all libraries of antiquity, he oversaw the production of accurate edited copies of Scripture. Testimonies to his zeal and care in this work are to be found in the colophons of biblical manuscripts. Jerome's \\"De Viris Illustribus\\" (75) says that Pamphilus \\"transcribed the greater part of the works of Origen of Alexandria with his own hand,\\" and that \\"these are still preserved in the library of C√¶sarea.\\" The collections of the library suffered during the persecutions under the Emperor Diocletian, but were repaired subsequently by bishops of Caesarea.Jerome, \\"Epistles\\" xxxiv It was noted in the 6th century, but Henry Barclay SweteIntroduction to the Old Testament in Greek, pp 74-75. was of the opinion that it probably did not long survive the capture of Caesarea by the Saracens in 638, though a modern historian would attribute more destruction to its previous capture by the Sassanid Persians. Following the schism between Constantinople and Rome in 1054, the community was a Greek Orthodox diocese, with only a marginal Roman Catholic community. During the crusader period, the community became Catholic in 1101. The Frankish community vastly increased in size and a Latin archbishop was established. Under the crusaders, the diocese increased over time to having ten suffragan bishops, including the bishop of Sebastea. During the remainder of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem often served first as archbishop of Caesarea, or of Tyre. There was a legend that the Holy Grail had been discovered in Caesarea; the ancient chalice found there in 1101 was later taken to Paris.Cross, F. L.

Print-outs, CRT or LCD monitors, and projectors all have a limited dynamic range that is inadequate to reproduce the full range of light intensities present in natural scenes. Tone mapping addresses the problem of strong contrast reduction from the scene radiance to the displayable range while preserving the image details and color appearance important to appreciate the original scene content. Background The introduction of film-based photography created issues since capturing the enormous dynamic range of lighting from the real world on a chemically limited negative was very difficult. Early film developers attempted to remedy this issue by designing the film stocks and the print development systems that gave a desired S-shaped tone curve with slightly enhanced contrast (about 15%) in the middle range and gradually compressed highlights and shadows . The advent of the Zone System, which bases exposure on the desired shadow tones along with varying the length of time spent in the chemical developer (thus controlling highlight tones) extended the tonal range of black and white (and later, color) negative film from its native range of about seven stops to about ten. Photographers have also used dodging and burning to overcome the limitations of the print process . The advent of digital photography gave hope for better solutions to this problem. One of the earliest algorithms employed by Land and McCann in 1971 was Retinex, inspired by theories of lightness perception .This method is inspired by the eye‚Äôs biological mechanisms of adaptation when lighting conditions are an issue. Gamut mapping algorithms were also extensively studied in the context of color printing. Computational models such as CIECAM02 or iCAM were used to predict color appearance. Despite this, if algorithms could not sufficiently map tones and colors, a skilled artist was still needed, as is the case with cinematographic movie post- processing. Computer graphic techniques capable of rendering high-contrast scenes shifted the focus from color to luminance as the main limiting factor of display devices. Several tone mapping operators were developed to map high dynamic range (HDR) images to standard displays. More recently, this work has branched away from utilizing luminance to extend image contrast and towards other methods such as user-assisted image reproduction. Currently, image reproduction has shifted towards display-driven solutions since displays now possess advanced image processing algorithms that help adapt rendering of the image to viewing conditions, save power, up-scale color gamut and dynamic range. Purpose and methods The goals of tone mapping can be differently stated depending on the particular application. In some cases producing just aesthetically pleasing images is the main goal, while other applications might emphasize reproducing as many image details as possible, or maximizing the image contrast. The goal in realistic rendering applications might be to obtain a perceptual match between a real scene and a displayed image even though the display device is not able to reproduce the full range of luminance values. Various tone mapping operators have been developed in the recent years. They all can be divided in two main types: *global (or spatially uniform) operators: they are non-linear functions based on the luminance and other global variables of the image. Once the optimal function has been estimated according to the particular image, every pixel in the image is mapped in the same way, independent of the value of surrounding pixels in the image. Those techniques are simple and fastG. Qiu et al, \\"Tone Mapping for HDR Image using Optimization-A New Closed Form Solution\\", Proc. ICPR 2006, 18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition, vol.1, pp.996-999 (since they can be implemented using look-up tables), but they can cause a loss of contrast. Examples of common global tone mapping methods are contrast reduction and color inversion. *local (or spatially varying) operators: the parameters of the non-linear function change in each pixel, according to features extracted from the surrounding parameters. In other words, the effect of the algorithm changes in each pixel according to the local features of the image. Those algorithms are more complicated than the global ones; they can show artifacts (e.g. halo effect and ringing); and the output can look unrealistic, but they can (if used correctly) provide the best performance, since human vision is mainly sensitive to local contrast. A simple example of global tone mapping filter is V_{\\\\text{out}}=\\\\frac{V_{\\\\text{in}}}{V_{\\\\text{in}}+1}, where Vin is the luminance of the original pixel and Vout is the luminance of the filtered pixel. This function will map the luminance Vin in the domain [0,\\\\infty) to a displayable output range of [0,1). While this filter provides a decent contrast for parts of the image with low luminance (particularly when ), parts of the image with higher luminance will get increasingly lower contrast as the luminance of the filtered image goes to 1. A perhaps more useful global tone mapping method is gamma compression, which has the filter V_{\\\\text{out}}=A\\\\,V_{\\\\text{in}}^{\\\\gamma}, where and . This function will map the luminance V in the domain [0,A^{-1/\\\\gamma}] to the output range [0,1]. Œ≥ regulates the contrast of the image; a lower value for lower contrast. While a lower constant Œ≥ gives a lower contrast and perhaps also a duller image, it increases the exposure of underexposed parts of the image while at the same time, if , it can decrease the exposure of overexposed parts of the image enough to prevent them from being overexposed. An even more sophisticated group of tone mapping algorithms is based on contrast or gradient domain methods, which are 'local'. Such operators concentrate on preserving contrast between neighboring regions rather than absolute value, an approach motivated by the fact that the human perception is most sensitive to contrast in images rather than absolute intensities. Those tone mapping methods usually produce very sharp images, which preserve very well small contrast details; however, this is often done at the cost of flattening an overall image contrast, and may as a side effect produce halo-like glows around dark objects. Examples of such tone mapping methods include: gradient domain high dynamic range compression and A Perceptual Framework for Contrast Processing of High Dynamic Range Images (a tone mapping is one of the applications of this framework). Another approach to tone mapping of HDR images is inspired by the anchoring theory of lightness perception. This theory explains many characteristics of the human visual system such as lightness constancy and its failures (as in the checker shadow illusion), which are important in the perception of images. The key concept of this tone mapping method (Lightness Perception in Tone Reproduction) is a decomposition of an HDR image into areas (frameworks) of consistent illumination and the local calculation of the lightness values. The net lightness of an image is calculated by merging of the frameworks proportionally to their strength. Particularly important is the anchoring‚Äîrelating of the luminance to a known luminance, namely estimating which luminance value is perceived as white in the scene. This approach to tone mapping does not affect the local contrast and preserves the natural colors of an HDR image due to the linear handling of luminance. One simple form of tone mapping takes a standard image (not HDR ‚Äì the dynamic range already compressed) and applies unsharp masking with a large radius, which increases local contrast rather than sharpening. See unsharp masking: local contrast enhancement for details. One of the commonly used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 which is based on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping. After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a base layer and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the base layer, while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The base layer of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect. Digital photography Tone mapped HDR image of Dundas Square; Tone mapping was done as post-processing technique, using Photomatix photographic software. Forms of tone mapping long precede digital photography. The manipulation of film and development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, although it is not usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with Ansel Adams, as described in his book The Print; see also his Zone System. The normal process of exposure compensation, brightening shadows and altering contrast applied globally to digital images as part of a professional or serious amateur workflow is also a form of tone mapping. However, HDR tone mapping, usually using local operators, has become increasingly popular amongst digital photographers as a post-processing technique, where several exposures at different shutter speeds are combined to produce an HDR image and a tone mapping operator is then applied to the result. There are now many examples of locally tone mapped digital images, inaccurately known as \\"HDR photographs\\", on the internet, and these are of varying quality. This popularity is partly driven by the distinctive appearance of locally tone mapped images, which many people find attractive, and partly by a desire to capture high-contrast scenes that are hard or impossible to photograph in a single exposure, and may not render attractively even when they can be captured. Although digital sensors actually capture a higher dynamic range than film, they completely lose detail in extreme highlights, clipping them to pure white, producing an unattractive result when compared with negative film, which tends to retain color and some detail in highlights. In some cases local tone mapping is used even though the dynamic range of the source image could be captured on the target media, either to produce the distinctive appearance of a locally tone mapped image, or to produce an image closer to the photographer's artistic vision of the scene by removing sharp contrasts, which often look unattractive. In some cases, tone mapped images are produced from a single exposure which is then manipulated with conventional processing tools to produce the inputs to the HDR image generation process. This avoids the artifacts that can appear when different exposures are combined, due to moving objects in the scene or camera shake. However, when tone mapping is applied to a single exposure in this way, the intermediate image has only normal dynamic range, and the amount of shadow or highlight detail that can be rendered is only that which was captured in the original exposure. Display devices One of the original goals of tone mapping was to be able to reproduce a given scene or image onto a display device such that the brightness sensation of the image to a human viewer closely matches the real-world brightness sensation. However, a perfect match for this problem is never possible and thus the output image on a display is often built from a tradeoff between different image features. Choosing between features is often based on the necessary application, and given appropriate metrics for the application, one possible solution is to treat the issue as an optimization problem. For this method, models for the Human Visual System (HVS) and the display are first generated, along with a simple tone mapping operator. The contrast distortions are weighted according to their individual visibilities approximated by the HVS. With these models, an objective function that defines the tone curve can be created and solved using a fast quadratic solver. With the addition of filters, this method can also be extended to videos. The filters ensure that the rapid changing of the tone-curve between frames are not salient in the final output image. Example of the imaging process High dynamic range image example showing stained glass windows in south alcove of Old Saint Paul's, Wellington, New Zealand. The six individual exposures used to create the previous image. In the low exposure images, the room is dark and unclear, but the details of the windows are visible. In the high exposure images, the windows are bright and unclear, but the details of the room are revealed. The images on the right show the interior of a church, a scene which has a variation in radiance much larger than that which can be displayed on a monitor or recorded by a conventional camera. The six individual exposures from the camera show the radiance of the scene in some range transformed to the range of brightnesses that can be displayed on a monitor. The range of radiances recorded in each photo is limited, so not all details can be displayed at once: for example, details of the dark church interior cannot be displayed at the same time as those of the bright stained-glass window. An algorithm is applied to the six images to recreate the high dynamic range radiance map of the original scene (a high dynamic range image). Alternatively, some higher-end consumer and specialist scientific digital cameras are able to record a high dynamic range image directly, for example with RAW images. In the ideal case, a camera might measure luminance directly and store this in the HDR image; however, most high dynamic range images produced by cameras today are not calibrated or even proportional to luminance, due to practical reasons such as cost and time required to measure accurate luminance values -- it is often sufficient for artists to use multiple exposures to gain an \\"HDR image\\" which grossly approximates the true luminance signal. The high dynamic range image is passed to a tone mapping operator, in this case a local operator, which transforms the image into a low dynamic range image suitable for viewing on a monitor. Relative to the church interior, the stained-glass window is displayed at a much lower brightness than a linear mapping between scene radiance and pixel intensity would produce. However, this inaccuracy is perceptually less important than the image detail, which can now be shown in both the window and the church interior simultaneously. Local tone mapping technique of HDR image processing often produces a number of characteristic effects in images such as bright halos around dark objects, dark halos around bright objects, and sometimes a \\"cartoon-like\\" appearance due to extremely vivid colors and lack of large-scale color variations. These results are caused by application of geometric space distortion of captured image along with color space distortion, while only color space distortions are a tone mapping effect, and all other distortions are rather a custom filtering technique than any tone or color space mapping. So, the results of local tone mapping are often judged as perverting the nature of a documentalist photographic image and far from photographic realism. Not all tone mapped images are visually distinctive. Reducing dynamic range with tone mapping is often useful in bright sunlit scenes, where the difference in intensity between direct illumination and shadow is great. In these cases the global contrast of the scene is reduced, but the local contrast maintained, while the image as a whole continues to look natural. Use of tone mapping in this context may not be apparent from the final image: Image:Grand Canyon HDR imaging.jpgRegions of direct illumination and shadow on the Grand Canyon Image:Bucket_of_fresh- picked_cherries.jpg File:Lamp base at N.Y. Public Library - Schwarzman Bldg. - exterior.jpgCartoon-like appearance Tone mapping can also produce distinctive visual effects in the final image, such as the visible halo around the tower in the Cornell Law School image below. It can be used to produce these effects even when the dynamic range of the original image is not particularly high. Halos in images come about because the local tone mapping operator will brighten areas around dark objects, to maintain the local contrast in the original image, which fools the human visual system into perceiving the dark objects as being dark, even if their actual luminance is the same as that of areas of the image perceived as being bright. Usually this effect is subtle, but if the contrasts in the original image are extreme, or the photographer deliberately sets the luminance gradient to be very steep, the halos become visible.

He hailed from the Greco-Parthian city of Artemita in Apolloniatis and was a citizen of the Parthian Empire. Biography Appollodorus's dates of birth and death are unknown. He is generally assumed to have flourished in 130-87 BC, but 99-66 BC and 66-44 BC have also been proposed as options. Apollodorus wrote a history of the Parthian Empire, the Parthika (), in at least four books. He is quoted by Strabo and Athenaeus. Strabo stated that he was very reliable. Apollodorus seems to have used the archives of Artemita and Seleucia on the Tigris for his work. Some information on the Greco-Bactrians are preserved in Strabo's work: :\\"The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Ariana, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander--by Menander in particular (at least if he actually crossed the Hypanis towards the east and advanced as far as the Imaus), for some were subdued by him personally and others by Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus the king of the Bactrians; and they took possession, not only of Patalena, but also, on the rest of the coast, of what is called the kingdom of Saraostus and Sigerdis. In short, Apollodorus says that Bactriana is the ornament of Ariana as a whole; and, more than that, they extended their empire even as far as the Seres and the Phryni.\\" (Strabo, Geographia, 11.11.1) He is also quoted for his general geographical knowledge of Central Asia: :\\"Accordingly, if the distance from Hyrcania to Artemita in Babylonia is eight thousand stadia, as is stated by Apollodorus of Artemita, and the distance from there to the mouth of the Persian Sea another eight thousand, and again eight thousand, or a little less, to the places that lie on the same parallel as the extremities of Ethiopia, there would remain of the above-mentioned breadth of the inhabited world the distance which I have already given,[14] from the recess of the Hyrcanian Sea to the mouth of that sea\\" (Strabo, Geographia, 11.11.1) References Sources * Category:Ancient Greek writers Category:1st-century BC Greek people Category:1st-century BC historians Category:People of the Parthian Empire Category:130s BC births Category:87 BC deaths Category:2nd-century BC Greek people Category:2nd-century BC historians ","title":"Apollodorus of Artemita"},{"id":"2153204","text":"Uzlovaya () is a town and the administrative center of Uzlovsky District in Tula Oblast, Russia.

Vol. 2. The Calm before the Storm, 1951-1955, University of California Press, London, 2007, p. 598) was an organization of Tibetan guerrilla fighters, formally created on June 16, 1958, which had been fighting the forces of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in Tibet since 1956. The Dokham Chushi Gangdruk organization, a charity set up in New York City and India with chapters in other countries, now supports survivors of the Chushi Gangdruk resistance currently living in India. Chushi Gangdruk also led The 14th Dalai Lama out of Lhasa, where he had lived, soon after the start of the Chinese invasion. During that time, a group of Chushi Gangdruk guerillas was led by Kunga Samten, who is now deceased. Because the United States was prepared to recognize People's Republic of China in the early 1970s, CIA Tibetan Program, which funded the Chushi Gangdruk army, was ended in 1974. Name Chushi Gangdruk \\"Four Rivers, Six Ranges\\" is the name traditionally given to the eastern Tibetan region of Kham where the gorges of the Gyalmo Nyulchu (Salween), Dzachu (Mekong), Drichu (Yangtse), and Machu (Huang Ho) rivers, all arising on the Tibetan Plateau, pass between six parallel ranges of mountains (Duldza Zalmogang, Tshawagang, Markhamgang, Pobargang, Mardzagang, and Minyagang) that form the watersheds for these rivers. \\"Chu\\" (choo) is the Tibetan word for \\"water\\", and \\"shi\\" (she) is the Tibetan word for 4. \\"Gang\\" is range, and \\"druk\\" (drewk) means 6. History = Fall of Chamdo and signing of the Seventeen-Point Agreement= On 19 October 1950, the monastery where Ngabo Shap√© was hiding was surrounded by the Chinese troops accompanied by a few Khampa guides, and here Ngabo Shap√© and his officials and troops surrendered to the invading Chinese. The Tibetan Government army in Chamdo was defeated, and the Communist Chinese army took over the city of Chamdo. In Drugu monastery, Ngabo Shap√© signed the official surrender. During the negotiation of the Seventeen-Point Agreement, when the negotiation broke down after Ngabo Shap√© resisted to sign the agreement, Li Weihan threatened to order the Chinese troops to march into Lhasa. They decided it was more perilous to Tibet not to reach an agreement, therefore, they accepted the Chinese terms without asking Lhasa. The Chinese were further furious when they were told that the Dalai Lama‚Äôs seal was still in Yatung with him. The Chinese made new seal for Ngabo Shap√© to stamp the document when he exclaimed that he did not have his official seal to stamp the document, though he had with him the official seal as the Governor General of Kham. Therefore, on 23 May 1951, Ngabo Shap√© was forced to sign under duress the \\"Agreement of the Central People‚Äôs Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,\\" commonly known as the ‚ÄúSeventeen-Point Agreement‚Äù. =Formation of Chushi Gangdrug= Andrug Gompo Tashi (also known as Andrug Jindak) established a people's army called Chushi Gangdrug. Like many other volunteered fighters, Andrug Jindak financed many of the freedom fighters and was accepted as their undisputed leader of the resistance army. In order to mobilize more support across the different regions of Tibet, the names Tenshung Danglang Mak were appended to Chushi Gangdrug in order to address the pan-Tibetan composition of the people's army. It was not a Tibetan government army but rather a grassroots army of the Tibetan people. Tenshung Danglang Mak fought for the political and religious freedom of Tibet. Khampas and Amdowas had been fighting against the invading Chinese Communist troops since 1956 in different parts of Kham and Amdo. On 16 June 1958, a meeting of Chushi Gangdrug and their supporters was held in Lhodak Dhama Dzong with impressive cavalry parade, incense burnt to the Dalai Lama photograph, and then launched the Chushi Gangdrug yellow flag of the Tensik Danglang Mak with an emblem of two swords represented a deity and handles symbolic of Dorjee or thunderbolt and lotus flower. The formation of the Chushi Gangdruk Volunteer Force was announced on June 16, 1958. It was called National Volunteer Defence Army (NVDA). \\"Chushi Gangdruk\\" is a Tibetan phrase meaning \\"land of four rivers and six ranges,\\" and refers to Amdo and Kham. The group included Tibetans from those regions of eastern Tibet, and its main objective was to drive PRC occupational forces out of Tibet. While central and western Tibet (√ú-Tsang) were bound by a 17-point agreement with the People's Republic of China, the PRC initiated land reform in eastern Tibet (including Amdo and Kham) and engaged in harsh reprisals against the Tibetan land-owners there. 281x281px Under the direction of General Andrug Gonpo Tashi, Chushi Gangdruk included 37 allied forces and 18 military commanders. They drafted a 27-point military law governing the conduct of the volunteers. Their headquarters were located at Tsona, then later moved to Lhagyari. Initially militia members purchased their own weapons, mainly World War II-era British .303 in, German 7.92 mm, and Russian 7.62 mm caliber rifles. Chushi Gangdruk contacted the US government for support. However, the State Department required an official request from the Tibetan government in Lhasa, which was not forthcoming. State Department requests were made and ignored in both 1957 and 1958. =CIA support= Without getting approval from the Dalai Lama, the US Central Intelligence Agency decided to go ahead to support the Chushi Gangdrug Tenshung Danglang Mak in the summer of 1959. The CIA provided the group with material assistance and aid, including arms and ammunition, as well as training to members of Chushi Gangdruk and other Tibetan guerrilla groups at Camp Hale. The Tibetan involvement with the U.S. came during the Cold War and decolonization period in world history that in the United States manifested as anticommunism, and in the People's Republic of China as anticapitalism. Allen Dulles, the CIA deputy director responsible for overseeing all CIA covert operations, saw an opportunity to destabilize Communist China. The primary motive was more to impede and harass the Chinese Communists, than to render sufficient aid to the Tibetans. =Surrender to Indian government= Chushi Gangdrug assisted the escape of the 14th Dalai Lama to India in March 1959. After this, the idea of any further battle with the Chinese Communist troops was abandoned. Andrug Jindak persuaded Kunga Samten Dewatshang in Tawang to surrender his weapons to the Indian authorities. Shangri Lhagyal and other Chushi Gangdrug fighters handed over their weapons to the Indian officials at Tezpur, India. They crossed the border where they were greeted by a representative of the Tibetan Government, Tsedrung Jampa Wangdu. On 29 April 1959, they handed over their rifles, ammunition, and all other weapons to the Deputy Commissioner of Tezpur district, and were permitted to take their gold, silver, and other valuables. The 14th Dalai Lama conferred the rank of Dsasak to Andrug Gompo Tashi in a letter: ‚ÄúYou have led the Chushi Gangdrug force with unshakeable determination to resist the Chinese occupation army for the great national cause of defending the freedom of Tibet. I confer on you the rank of Dzasak (the highest military rank equivalent to general) in recognition of your services to the country. The present situation calls for a continuance of your brave struggle with the same determination and courage.‚Äù In addition, Andrug Jindak received some gifts of priceless religious relics including an earthen statue of God of Protection Jigchi Mahai and some holy beads. =Later guerrilla operations= From 1960, Chushi Gangdruk conducted its guerrilla operations from the northern Nepalese region of Mustang. In 1974, guerrilla operations ceased after the CIA, given the realignment of Sino-American relations initiated by President Richard Nixon, terminated its program of assistance to the Tibetan resistance movement and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual and temporal leader, taped a message telling the Tibetans to lay down their weapons and surrender peacefully.

Their father had preceded them, immigrating to Baltimore in 1888 and following his trade in shoes and shoe repair. He changed the family name to Warner, which was used thereafter. As in many Jewish immigrant families, some of the children gradually acquired anglicized versions of their Yiddish-sounding names. Abraham and Jacob were late among the children to do so, becoming \\"Albert\\" and \\"Jack\\" after they came of age.Sinclair (2008), citing the 1900 census However, his nickname was \\"Abe.\\"Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 22. In Baltimore, the money Benjamin Warner earned in the shoe repair business was not enough to provide for his growing household. He and Pearl had another daughter, Fannie, not long after they arrived. Benjamin moved the family to Canada, inspired by a friend's advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs. Sons Jacob and David Warner were born in London, Ontario.Sinclair (2008), citing the 1910 US census. After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 23‚Äì24. Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there.Sinclair (2008), citing the 1900 and 1910 US censuses. In 1896, the family relocated to Youngstown, Ohio, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 24‚Äì25. Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city's downtown area.Thomas (1990), pp. 12‚Äì13.Thomas (1990), p. 12. In the late 1890s, Albert became fascinated by the bicycle craze that swept through the USA.Thomas (1990), p. 15. and his older brother Harry opened a bicycle shop in Youngstown together as well.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 26. The two also tried to open a bowling alley together, but were unsuccessful. Albert Warner stayed in school longer than any his three brothers.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 10. In 1900, Warner entered Youngstown's Rayen High School, where he served as quarterback for the school's football team. Warner eventually dropped out, and eventually got a job in Chicago as a salesman for the soap company Swift and Company.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 11. Warner's life would soon pursue a new direction after brother Sam was able to purchase Kinetoscope in 1903.Warner and Jennings (1964), p. 50. Film career As a young man, along with his brother Sam, Albert Warner entered the nickelodeon business, and started displaying copies of The Great Train Robbery from a Kinetoscope at carnivals in Ohio and Pennsylvania in 1903; Sam ran the projector and Albert sold tickets.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 32-34. In 1905, Harry agreed to join his two brothers' business and sold his Youngstown bicycle shop. During this time, the three brothers purchased a building in New Castle, Pennsylvania; with their new building, the brothers established their first theater, The Cascade Movie Palace.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 54‚Äì55. The theater was so successful that the brothers were able to purchase a second theater in New Castle as well.Thomas (1990), p. 22. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. In 1907, the three brothers acquired fifteen additional theaters in the state of Pennsylvania, and named their new business The Dusquesne Amusement Supply Company.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 40-42. The three brothers then rented an office in the Bakewell building in downtown Pittsburgh with a loan from Max Fleischer. Harry then sent Sam to New York to purchase and ship films for their Pittsburgh exchange company, while he and Albert remained in Pittsburgh to run the business. In 1909, the brothers sold the Cascade Theater to open a second film exchange company in Norfolk, Virginia; through this second film exchange, younger brother Jack joined his three brothers' business. Afterwards, Sam and Jack went to Norfolk, while Harry and Albert stayed in Pittsburgh. However, one serious threat to the Warners film company was the advent of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees.Warner and Jennings (1964), pp. 65-66. In 1910, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company, for \\"$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000\\".Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 45-46. After selling their business, the brothers found work distributing films for Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company in Pittsburgh. In 1912, Sam Warner would help the brothers earn a $1,500 profit by distributing the Italian film Dante's Inferno in the United States.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 47-48. Harry Warner, encouraged by the success of Dante's Inferno and wary of Edison's growing monopoly, decided to leave Laemmle and establish an independent film production company for himself and his three brothers, Warner Features; Albert and Harry opened an office in New York, while Sam was sent to operate the company's new Los Angeles film exchange division, and Jack was sent to run the company's new San Francisco film exchange division.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 51-54 In 1918, thanks in part to a loan from Ambassador James W. Gerald,Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 62. the brothers expanded operations and established a studio near Hollywood, CaliforniaSperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 66-67. Sam and Jack moved to the West Coast to produce films while Albert and Harry remained on the East Coast to handle distribution. Between the years 1919 and 1920, the studio was not able to garnish any profits.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), pp. 71-77 During this time, banker Motley Flint helped the Warners pay off their debts. Shortly afterwards, the four brothers then decided to relocate their studio from Culver City to Sunset Boulevard.Thomas (1990), pp. 38. The studio rebounded in 1921, after the success of the studio's film Why Girls Leave Home. As a result of the financial success of the film, its director, Harry Rapf, was appointed the studio's new head producer. On April 4, 1923, following the studio's successful film The Gold Diggers, Warner Brothers, Inc. was officially established. Albert remained in New York, where he ran the company's distribution and finances.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), pp. 173-174 Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc. Warner Bros' first film, Where the North Begins, drew success for the brothers not seen since My Four Years in Germany.Thomas (1990), p. 75. The film also made the dog Rin Tin Tin the studio's first star. Newcomer director Darryl Zanuck's career was also greatly boosted because of his productions of Rin Tin Tin as well.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 82. Zanuck would eventually become a top producer for the studio as well,Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 101. and between 1928 and 1933, served as Jack Warner's right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films.Behlmer (1985), p. xii. After establishing Warner Bros. Pictures, the studio had overdrawn $1,000,000 (the amount which Warner had loaned from Flint). At this, Albert convinced Harry not to purchase the screenrights to the hit play Rain. Harry then decided to help ease the company's financial status by acquiring forty theaters in the state of Pennsylvania. More success would also come for the studio after the brothers hired German director Ernst Lubitsch as head director; Rapf had departed the studio and accepted an offer to work at MGM. Lubitsch's first film at the studio, The Marriage Circle, became the studio's most successful film of 1924, and was also on the New York Times best list for the year. The studio's 1924 film Beau Brummel also made John Barrymore a top star at the studio. Despite the success the brothers now had, they still could not compete with the \\"big three\\" studios (First National, Paramount, and MGM) In 1925, Albert's older brother Harry and a large group of independent film-makers assembled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to challenge the monopoly the big three had over the film industry. Harry and the other independent film-makers at the Milwaukee convention agreed to spend $500,000 in newspaper advertisements; this action would help benefit Warner Bros. profits. With help from a loan supplied by Goldman, Sachs head banker Waddill Catchings, Warner would find a way to successfully respond to the growing concern the big three studios further induced to Warner Bros., and expanded the company's operations by purchasing the Brooklyn theater company Vitagraph. Through this purchase, the Warners now had theaters in the New York area. In 1925, Sam Warner had also acquired a radio station, KWBC.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 89. After acquiring this radio station, Sam decided to make an attempt to use synchronized sound in future Warner Bros. pictures.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 90. However, Sam Warner had initial reservations about the idea, in which he is quoted as saying \\"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\\" when his brother, CEO Harry Warner proposed the idea to him. Under Warner and his brothers leadership, the company came to own and operate some 250 theaters in which to screen its films, and was a successful pioneer of the sound film industry and the company still thrives today. However, by February 1926 the brothers' radio business had failed, and the studio suffered a net loss of $333,413. After a period of refusing to accept the usage of sound in the company's films, Harry Warner now agreed to use synchronized sound in Warner Bros. shorts, as long as it just for usage of background music, Harry then made a visit to Western Electric's Bell Laboratories in New York, (which younger brother Sam had earlier visited) and was impressed. One problem that occurred for the Warners was the fact that the high-ups at Western Electric were anti-Semitic. Sam was able to convince the high-ups to sign with the studio after his wife Lina wore a gold cross at a dinner he attended with Western Electric. Afterwards, Harry signed a partnership agreement with Western Electric to use Bell Laboratories to test the sound-on-film process. After the agreement was signed, Vitaphone was established, and Sam and Jack decided to take a big step forward make Don Juan. The film began with eight Vitaphone features filmed in sound. Despite the success it had at the box office, the film was not able to match its expensive budget. Harry was now further convinced not to use any more sound in Warner Bros. pictures. With Harry now refusing to allow further Vitaphone productions, Paramount head Adolph Zukor took advantage of the situation and tried to offer Sam a deal as an executive producer for his studio if he brought Vitaphone with him. Sam easily accepted Zukor's offer, but the offer died after Paramount lost money in the wake of Rudolph Valentino's death in late 1926. By April 1927, the Big Five studios (First National, Paramount, MGM, Universal, and Producers Distributing) had put the Warners in financial ruin, and Western Electric renewed the Warner's Vitaphone contract with terms that it was no longer exclusive and that other film company's could test sound with Western Electric as well; the Warners were even forced to sell some of their stock to Harry Cohn, the head of the independent film company Columbia Pictures. Eventually, Harry agreed to accept Sam's demands to continue with Vitaphone productions, and the studio soon began production of the first talkie, The Jazz Singer; soon after its release, The Jazz Singer would indeed help establish the Warners as, arguably, the three most important figures in the film industry. On October 5, 1927 Sam would die and younger brother Jack was granted with the power to head all of the studio's production, despite the fact that Jack still did not have as much power over the studio as Harry did, as he was only the studio's vice president. =Kings of the talking screen= With the success of the Jazz Singer, more talkies followed. With the large sums of money the Warners now had on-hand, Harry was able to expand business operations further. Harry Warner was able to acquire the Stanley Corporation for the studio, This purchase gave them a share in rival First National Pictures, of which Stanley owned one-third. After this purchase, Warner was soon able to acquire William Fox's one third remaining share in First National and was now officially the majority stockholder of the company. Harry, after purchasing a string of music publishers, was even able to establish a music subsidiary-Warner Bros. Music- and buy out additional radio companies, foreign sound patents, and a lithograph company as well; In 1929, with the large amount of money he now had made off of the studio's valuable subsidiaries, Albert acquired a large home in Rye, Westchester County, New York, which he dubbed \\"Caradel Hall.\\"Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 154  The Great Depression  With the Wall Street Crash of 1929 officially marking the beginning of The Great Depression, Albert saw that the studio was in need of additional star power in order to survive. Following Albert's advice, Jack and Harry Warner acquired three Paramount stars (William Powell, Kay Francis, and Ruth Chatterton) for studio salaries doubled from their previous ones. This move proved to be a success, and stockholders maintained confident in the Warners. In late 1929, Jack Warner would hire sixty-one-year-old actor George Arliss to star in the studio's film Disraeli.Thomas (1990), p. 77. To everybody's surprise, the film Disraeli was a success, and Arliss would win an Oscar for Best Actor for his role in the film and star in nine more films with the studio as well. With the collapse of the market for musicals, Warner Bros., under production head Darryl F. Zanuck, turned to more realistic and gritty storylines, 'torn from the headlines' pictures that some said glorified gangsters; Warner Bros. soon became known as \\"gangster studio. The studio's first gangster film Little Caesar was a great success at the box office.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 184. And Edward Robinson was cast a star in many of the wave of gangster films the studio produced after Little Caesar.Thomas (1990), pp. 77‚Äì79. The studio's next gangster film, The Public Enemy,Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 185 would also make James Cagney arguably the studio's new top star,Thomas (1990), pp. 81. and the Warners were now further convinced to make more gangster films as well. Another gangster film the studio produced was the critically acclaimed I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, starring Paul Muni.Thomas (1990), pp. 83. In addition to Cagney and Robinson, Paul Muni was also given a big push as one the studio's top gangster stars after appearing in the successful film I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 186. The film got audiences in the United States to question the legal system in the United States. and by January 1933, the film's protagonist Robert Elliott Burns - who was still imprisoned in New Jersey - and a number of different chain gang prisoners nationwide in the United States were able to appeal and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J Harold Hardy - who was also made into a character in the film - sued the studio for displaying \\"vicious, brutual and false attacks\\" against him in the film. After appearing in the film The Man Who Played God, Bette Davis would also become a top star for the studio as well.Thomas (1990), pp. 82‚Äì83. In 1933, the studio's very successful film 42nd Street would revive the studio's musicalsSperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 194. Most these new musicals featured Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell as the stars, and were mostly directed by Busby Berkeley.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 192. By 1931, however, the studio would begin to feel the effects of the Depression as the general public became unable to afford the price for movie tickets.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 160. In 1931, the studio would reportedly suffer a net loss of $8,000,000.00. The following year, the studio would suffer an additional $14,000,000.00 net loss as well. In 1933, relief for the studio came after Franklin Roosevelt became US president in 1933 and US economy rebounded due to the New Deal;Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 161. because of this economic rebound, box office profits for Warner Bros. existed once again. However, this same year, the studio's long time head producer Darryl F. Zanuck quit, because: 1) Harry Warner's relationship with Zanuck became strained after Harry was strongly against allowing Zanuck film Baby Face to step outside the Hays Code boundaries; and 2) the studio reduced Zanuck's salary as a result of the financial woes the Great Depression gave the studio's net profits, and Harry still refused to raise his salary in the wake of the New Deal's rebound. Zanuck produced his letter of resignation to Jack Warner,Behlmer (1985), p. 12. and went on to establish his own company. In the wake of Zanuck's resignation, Harry Warner agreed to again raise the salary for the studio's employees. In 1933, the studio was also able to bring newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan films into the Warner Bros. fold. Hearst had previously been signed with MGM, but he ended his ties with the company after a dispute with the company's head producer Irving Thalberg over the treatment of Marion Davies; Davies was a longtime mistress of Hearst, and was now struggling to draw box office success. Through the studios partnership with Hearst, Harry's younger brother Jack was also able to sign Davies to a studio contract as well. Hearst's company and Davies' films, however, could not increase the studio's net profits. In 1934, Warner officially purchased the Teddington Studio as well. In 1934, the studio would suffer a net loss of over $2,500,000.00. $500,000 of this loss was also the result of physical damage to the Warner Bros. Burbank studio that occurred after a massive fire that broke out in the studio around the end of 1934, and destroyed twenty years worth of early Warner Bros. films. The following year, Hearst's film adaption of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream would fail at the box office and the studio net loss increased. During the year 1935, the studio's revived musicals would also suffer a major blow after director Busby Berkeley was arrested after killing three people while driving drunk one night. By the end of the 1935, however, relief would come for the Warners, as the studio would rebound with a year-end net profit of $674,158.00.  Post war era  On November 25, 1947, Albert Warner and other executives in the motion picture industry issued the Waldorf Statement, first promulgating the Hollywood Blacklist. Around this time, Albert also bought a second mansion in Miami Beach, Florida, where he lived for most of the remaining years of his life.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 340. By 1956, the studio was losing money and Albert wanted to retire and live full- time in his Miami Beach house.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 295. In May 1956, the brothers announced they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack, however, secretly organized a syndicate headed by Boston banker Serge Semenenko that purchased 90% (800,000 shares) of the company's stock.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 303-309. After the three brothers sold their stock, in an under-the-table deal with Semenenko, Jack officially joined Semenenko's syndicate and bought back all his stock, which consisted of 200,000 shares. The deal officially completed in July. Now the company's largest stockholder, Jack appointed himself as the new company president. By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother's subterfuge, it was too late. Albert read about Jack's dealings while spending time in New York City. He never spoke to Jack again, but he did later rejoin the company's board of directors to stop Jack \\"from stealing the stockholders blind\\". Albert Warner died of a strokehttps://books.google.com/books?id=RjYuDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA191&dq;=albert+warner+died&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi_55uI0cLdAhXNFTQIHdPqBe8Q6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q;=albert%20warner%20died&f;=false in 1967 in Miami Beach. A funeral service was held in Los Angeles.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 339. Warner was then interred in Brooklyn, next to his first wife Bessie Krieger. After Albert's second wife Bessie Warner died in 1970 she was interred with him as well in Brooklyn.  Personal life  In 1908, Warner married Bessie Krieger, in New Castle, Pennsylvania.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 38. Krieger died in 1923 from influenza.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 78. On April 23, 1925, Warner married Bessie Siegal, the widow of his friend,Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 88 Jonas Siegal.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 540. The couple remained married until Warner's death in 1967. Through his marriage to Bessie Siegel, Warner had a stepson, Arthur Jack Steel, who married Ruth Mandel, and had sons John and Lewis Steel (named after Harry Warner's son Lewis Warner). Warner was noted to never adapt the upper class lifestyle, remaining unrefined throughout his life.Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 170-173. Thoroughbred racing Like his brother Harry, Albert too would be a fan of Thoroughbred racing and beginning in the 1930s owned horses he raced under the name Warbern Stable and later under the nom de course, Warner Stable. Albert Warner became involved in Thoroughbred acing during the 1930s In March 1945, Warner purchased Elberton Hill Farm in Harford County, Maryland from G. Ray Bryson and his wife, Ella K. Bryson. The property was used for his East Coast racing operations under the management of trainer A. G. \\"Bob\\" Robertson.

No formalities, such as copyright registration, are necessary to obtain all the exclusive rights that the Dutch copyright provides. The duration of a copyright is generally 70 years after the death of the author.article 37, Dutch Copyright Law The term \\"work\\" includes many materials, such as books, brochures, films, photographs, musical works, works of visual art and geographical maps.article 10, Dutch Copyright Law Furthermore, the Dutch Supreme Court has ruled that to be considered a work, it should have its own, original character with the personal imprint of the author (HR 4 January 1991, NJ 1991, 608(Van Dale/Romme)).Decision in HR 4 January 1991, NJ 1991, 608 (Van Dale/Romme) This threshold of originality has since been superseded by a decision of the European Court of Justice (C-5/08) and is now \\"The author's own intellectual Creation\\". The exclusive right to publish a work includes amongst others the publication of a copy of (part of) the work, the public recitation thereof and to rent or lend (part of) the work to public institutions.article 12, Dutch Copyright Law The exclusive right to duplicate a work includes amongst others the recording, the translation, the music arrangement and the adaptation for the screen of the work.article 13, Dutch Copyright Law  International laws and treaties  Copyright laws differ between countries. However, there are several international treaties concerning copyright that harmonise copyright to a certain extent. The Netherlands is a signature state to among others: * The Berne Convention, 1886 * The Universal Copyright Convention, 1952 * The WIPO Copyright Treaty, 1996 * The WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, 1996 * The Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (which manages the rights concerning trade in intellectual property) Since the Netherlands is a member state of the European Union all directives and regulations of the European Union apply in the Netherlands. As such copyright in the Netherlands has some specific features over the Copyright law of the European Union  Specific features  * Copyright is only granted to creative, original works. The creator of the work must have used some creativity or a certain creative decision must have been made. Creativity is a relative term, however, as this is a legal, not aesthetic, standard. * Copyright is granted automatically, without any (registration) formality, in the Netherlands, as it is in any other country that is party to the Berne Convention. This means that it is not necessary to include copyright indicators such as \\"copyright 2006\\". In fact, the word \\"copyright\\" has no legal meaning in the Netherlands. * A copyright lasts for a finite amount of time. Specifically, 70 years after the death of the author. When a copyright expires, the work become part of the public domain. An author also can prematurely renounce a copyright. * Neither the expertise of the author, nor the quality of the creation itself is a relevant factor in determining whether a creation is a work or not. An underexposed, badly composed picture of the Eiffel Tower can be just as copyright-protected as a two-meter-tall print of a perfect photograph of the same tower by a professional photographer, provided that the legal requirements of a work are met. * Dutch laws, rulings and regulations are not copyright-protected. This means that they can be used at all times by anyone for any purpose (article 11). However, some publishers of legal texts and court rulings may claim auteursrecht with regard to the form or order in which they are presented. * The Auteurswet allows for citaatrecht (quotation right).article 15a, Dutch Copyright Law This allows the use of (parts of) a work under a limitative set of conditions. Quotation rights appear to be more limited and demarcated than the concept of fair use. * A ' (portrait right) regards rights of the person portrayed in a portrait that is not made on behalf of that person, in contrast to an auteursrecht which grants rights to the creator of a work. An example is the publication of someone's picture in a magazine. The person portrayed can oppose such publication to the extent he or she has a reasonable interest in doing so.article 21, Dutch Copyright Law * A copyright can be transferred or licensed. A license is a permission of the author to use the work as agreed upon by the author and the licensee.

This includes the right of the author to oppose the publication of the work without stating him as the author and any modifications or malformations to the work.

Implemented in article 15(b), 17(a), and 17(b) of the Dutch Copyright Law. The Netherlands has four further notable limitations and exceptions to copyright: *The further communication to the public or reproduction of a literary, scientific or artistic work communicated to the public by or on behalf of the public authorities shall not be deemed an infringement of the copyright in such a work, unless the copyright has been explicitly reserved, either in a general manner by law, decree or ordinance, or in a specific case by a notice on the work itself or at the communication to the public.Article 15(b) of the Dutch Copyright Law. Even if no such reservation has been made, the author shall retain the exclusive right to have appear, in the form of a collection, his works which have been communicated to the public by or on behalf of the public authorities. * The lending as referred to in article 12(1), sub 3, of the whole or part of a specimen of the work or a reproduction thereof brought into circulation by or with the consent of the right-holder shall not be deemed an infringement of copyright, provided the person doing or arranging the lending pays an equitable remuneration.Article 15c(1) of the Dutch Copyright Law. The first sentence shall not apply to a work referred to in article 10(1) sub 12, unless that work is part of a data carrier containing data and serves exclusively to make the said data accessible. * Congregational singing and the instrumental accompaniment thereof during a religious service shall not be deemed an infringement of the copyright in a literary or artistic work.Article 17(c) of the Dutch Copyright Law. * The reproduction of a portrait by or on behalf of the person portrayed or, after his death, by or on behalf of his relatives, shall not be deemed an infringement of copyright.Article 19(1) of the Dutch Copyright Law. = Private copy = In certain circumstances, one is allowed to make a copy of copyright materials. This is also called a homecopy. According to Dutch Auteurswet article 16b and 16c ¬ß 1, articles 16b-c, Dutch Copyright Law and Wet op de Naburige rechten article 10, 'reproducing a piece of literature, science or art' is not seen as infringement to copyright if in line with the following: # The home copy is not, direct or indirect, means for monetary gain; # The copy serves exclusively to own practice, study or use; # The number of copies are limited, or the creator of additional copies compensates the holder. On 10 April 2014 the European Court of Justice ruled the Dutch exclusion for home-copying to be infringing the directive 2001/29/EG - article 5 ¬ß 2- b and ¬ß 5. According to EU directive, this makes homecopying unlawful. There have been other cases in which Dutch Auteurswet has been ruled unlawful. The Netherlands however has not changed said article nor complied to the request to make prosecuting those whom homecopy possible.  History  Historically, governments issued monopolierechten (monopoly-rights) to publishers for the sale of printed work. Great Britain was the first to change this in 1710 with the Statute of Anne, which stated that authors, not publishers, had the right to claim a monopoly on the work. It also entailed protection for buyers of printed work in that publishers were no longer allowed to control the use of sold works. Furthermore, it limited exclusive rights to 28 years, after which the work or works would be released to the public domain. The Berne Convention in 1886 was the first multilateral treaty to provide for reciprocal treatment of copyrights among sovereign nations. Under the Berne Convention the right of ownership (eigendomsrecht in Dutch) was automatically granted to every creative work. The author no longer needed to register the work, and was not required to apply for copyright coverage. The Berne Convention is still in effect today. When a work is finished (defined as being written or recorded on a physical medium), the author automatically receives all exclusive rights for that work as well as derivatives, unless and until the author explicitly renounces those rights or the copyright expires. The expiration time differs from country to country, but according to the Berne Convention the minimum duration is the lifetime of the author plus 50 years.

Radiosity methods can be used to determine the diffuse lighting of the scene, however PRT offers a method to dynamically change the lighting environment. In essence, PRT computes the illumination of a point as a linear combination of incident irradiance. An efficient method must be used to encode this data, such as spherical harmonics. When spherical harmonics are used to approximate the light transport function, only low-frequency effects can be handled with a reasonable number of parameters. Ren Ng extended this work to handle higher frequency shadows by replacing spherical harmonics with non- linear wavelets.

Whether light is affected by gravity under Newtonian mechanics is unclear but if it were accelerated the same way as projectiles, any light emitted at the surface of a dark star would be trapped by the star's gravity, rendering it dark, hence the name. Dark stars are analogous to black holes in general relativity. Dark star theory history =John Michell and dark stars= During 1783 geologist John Michell wrote a letter to Henry Cavendish outlining the expected properties of dark stars, published by The Royal Society in their 1784 volume. Michell calculated that when the escape velocity at the surface of a star was equal to or greater than lightspeed, the generated light would be gravitationally trapped so that the star would not be visible to a distant astronomer. Michell's idea for calculating the number of such \\"invisible\\" stars anticipated 20th century astronomers' work: he suggested that since a certain proportion of double-star systems might be expected to contain at least one \\"dark\\" star, we could search for and catalogue as many double-star systems as possible, and identify cases where only a single circling star was visible. This would then provide a statistical baseline for calculating the amount of other unseen stellar matter that might exist in addition to the visible stars. =Dark stars and gravitational shifts= Michell also suggested that future astronomers might be able to identify the surface gravity of a distant star by seeing how far the star's light was shifted to the weaker end of the spectrum, a precursor of Einstein's 1911 gravity-shift argument. However, Michell cited Newton as saying that blue light was less energetic than red (Newton thought that more massive particles were associated with bigger wavelengths), so Michell's predicted spectral shifts were in the wrong direction. It is difficult to tell whether Michell's careful citing of Newton's position on this may have reflected a lack of conviction on Michell's part over whether Newton was correct or just academic thoroughness. =Wave theory of light= In 1796, the mathematician Pierre- Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du syst√®me du Monde, independently of Michell. Because of the development of the wave theory of light, Laplace may have removed it from later editions as light came to be thought of as a massless wave, and therefore not influenced by gravity and as a group, physicists dropped the idea although the German physicist, mathematician, and astronomer Johann Georg von Soldner continued with Newton's corpuscular theory of light as late as 1804. =Indirect radiation= Dark stars and black holes both have a surface escape velocity equal or greater than lightspeed, and a critical radius of r ‚â§ 2M. However, the dark star is capable of emitting indirect radiation ‚Äì outward-aimed light and matter can leave the r = 2M surface briefly before being recaptured, and while outside the critical surface, can interact with other matter, or be accelerated free from the star through such interactions. A dark star, therefore, has a rarefied atmosphere of \\"visiting particles\\", and this ghostly halo of matter and light can radiate, albeit weakly. Also as Faster than light speeds are possible in Newtonian mechanics, it is possible for particles to escape. Comparisons with black holes  ; Radiation effects : A dark star may emit indirect radiation as described above. Black holes as described by current theories about quantum mechanics emit radiation through a different process, Hawking radiation, first postulated in 1975. The radiation emitted by a dark star depends on its composition and structure; Hawking radiation, by the no-hair theorem, is generally thought of as depending only on the black hole's mass, charge, and angular momentum, although the black hole information paradox makes this controversial. ; Light-bending effects : If Newtonian physics does have a gravitational deflection of light (Newton, Cavendish, Soldner), general relativity predicts twice as much deflection in a light beam skimming the Sun. This difference can be explained by the additional contribution of the curvature of space under modern theory: while Newtonian gravitation is analogous to the space-time components of general relativity's Riemann curvature tensor, the curvature tensor only contains purely spatial components, and both forms of curvature contribute to the total deflection.

SkyWest Airlines provides scheduled passenger service to Denver marketed as United Express and supported by the Essential Air Service. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 11,956 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 10,113 in 2009 and 9,530 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 categorized it as a primary commercial service airport based on enplanements over 10,000 in 2008, but is non-primary commercial service based on enplanements in 2010.  History  In 1940 Kearney had a population of 9,643. In the early 1940s, three Nebraska cities, Kearney, Grand Island and Hastings joined to form the Central Nebraska Defense Council when it was learned that the United States Army Air Forces was considering the site for a military airfield. The group attempted to convince Washington that central Nebraska was suitable. Kearney and Grand Island effectively competed as locations for defense airports which would serve as storage for aircraft made at Offutt Field and the Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant near Omaha. As early as 1941 the City of Kearney voted on a $60,000 bond to finance a new airport. Kearney Regional Airport began as Keens Municipal Airport. The cost was more than $360,000, with the balance funded by the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Construction began at the site on Highway 30 on October 21, 1941, and was dedicated as Keens Airport on August 23, 1942, with asphalt runways and one hangar. A handful of buildings from the military era remain at Kearney Airport, notably Hangar #385. The first airline flights were Mid-West Cessna 190s in 1950-52, then Frontier DC-3s appeared in 1959. Frontier's Convairs lasted until 1979. Facilities Kearney Regional Airport covers 2,500 acres (1,012 ha) at an elevation of 2,131 feet (650 m). It has two runways: 18/36 is 7,094 by 100 feet (2,162 x 30 m) concrete; 13/31 is 4,498 by 75 feet (1,371 x 23 m) concrete. In the year ending September 30, 2011 the airport had 30,040 aircraft operations, average 82 per day: 93% general aviation, 5% airline, and 2% air taxi. 29 aircraft were then based at the airport: 83% single-engine, 14% multi-engine, and 3% helicopter.

Leadership  The Foundation was founded in 1950 by Charles A. Dana, a legislator and businessman from New York State, and CEO of the Dana Corporation. He presided over the organization until 1960, but continued to participate until his death in 1975. Steven E. Hyman, M.D., is Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Foundation. Burton M. Mirsky is the current president of the foundation; he served as vice president, finance, before being elected president and chairman in 2019. He succeeded Edward F. Rover, who served as vice-chairman of the Board of Directors of the Foundation before being elected president in 2000 and then chairman in 2010. Rover was a senior partner at White & Case, L.L.P. in New York City until December 31, 2003. Rover succeeded William Safire, who became the Foundation's chairman following David Mahoney‚Äôs death in 2000.  The Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives  The Dana Foundation supports the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives (which includes the European Dana Alliance for the Brain), a nonprofit organization of leading neuroscientists committed to advancing public awareness about the progress and promise of brain research. The Dana Alliance was officially launched in 1993, and has more than 670 members worldwide. As William Safire put it in his column retiring from The New York Times in 2005: \\"They roped me in, a dozen years ago, to help enliven a moribund 'decade of the brain.' By encouraging many of the most prestigious neuroscientists to get out of the ivory tower and explain in plain words the potential of brain science, they enlisted the growing public and private support for research.\\"  Research grant programs  The Dana Foundation‚Äôs area of research emphasis has been in neuroscience, focusing on neuroimaging and clinical neuroscience research. In 2019, the Foundation paused awarding new research grants while the Board of Trustees worked to revise its strategic plan for future neuroscience grants. In-progress grants continue to be funded through the life of the grant (usually 3 years). Past grant programs include David Mahoney Neuroimaging grants, which support research on imaging innovations, and Clinical Neuroscience Research grants, supporting researchers who are testing promising therapies that move from animal models to a small number of human patients with devastating, currently untreatable brain diseases (first-in-human studies). Also supported are studies to develop ethical guidelines in brain research and explore other aspects of neuroethics.  Public education  The Foundation has a range of outreach initiatives for the general public and for targeted audiences. Major initiatives include: = Event-based programs = Brain Awareness Week (#brainweek) is the global campaign to increase public awareness of the progress and benefits of brain research. Partner organizations host creative and innovative activities in their communities to educate kids and adults about the brain. Brain Awareness Week 2020 will be held from March 16 to 22. Successful Aging & Your Brain forums are discussions by expert panels followed by Q&A; sessions with the audience. The forums address how the brain changes as we age, memory loss, brain diseases and disorders, and maintaining cognitive function. Related videos and a booklet are available on the Dana Foundation website. Judicial Seminars on Emerging Issues in Neuroscience provide state and federal judges in the US with a better understanding of the role neuroscience may play in making legal determinations in the courts, from the admissibility of neuroimaging evidence to decisions about criminal culpability. The Foundation also provides funding for the Royal Society‚Äôs Neuroscience and the Law program in the UK. = Free resources = The Dana Foundation website, dana.org, offers scientist-vetted information about the brain, including PDFs of publications, fact sheets, and lesson plans to download and share, as well as articles, videos, and podcasts targeted to non- scientists.

By 1994, Toolworks employed 600 people and had a revenue of . In May that year, it was acquired by Pearson plc for , which converted it to bear the Mindscape identity by November.  History  = Early years (1979‚Äì1982) = The Software Toolworks was founded by programmer Walt Bilofsky, who, after studying at Cornell University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), had worked for the Institute for Defense Analyses, as a programmer for RAND Corporation, and as a consultant. In 1979, he acquired and assembled a Heathkit H89 microcomputer; he found that the microcomputer lacked important software and thus began developing new software and ports of his own, including a fullscreen editor and a compiler for the C programming language entitled C/80, the latter based on Ron Cain's public-domain compiler Small-C. Bilofsky subsequently contacted the Heath Company, which made the Heathkit series of microcomputers, to have it market his software and, in response, was told that the operating system and the BASIC programming language Heathkit microcomputers came with were sufficient. He instead turned to advertise his software in BUSS, a Heathkit hobbyist newsletter, starting in 1980, quickly receiving orders for his software. Bilofsky eventually adopted the name \\"The Software Toolworks\\", using it publicly for the first time with an advertisement submitted to the magazine Byte in June 1980. He converted his garage in Sherman Oaks, California, in a two-room office, outfitting it with disk duplicator, shelving, and a shipping area. This office was later relocated into a garden shed. By the end of the year, Toolworks had entered the video game business, having published Airport, an air traffic control game by Jim Gillogly, and MyChess, a chess game by Dave Kittinger. This continued in 1981, with Robert Wesson developing a clone of Pac-Man, the game Munchkin, and a port of Invaders for the H89, and Bilofksy adapting the artificial intelligence psychiatrist ELIZA. Other early non-game software included the spreadsheet editor Zencalc (later replaced by MyCalc), the text editor PIE, the text formatting application TEXT, and the spelling checker SPELL. One of Toolworks' major releases was a port of Adventure, a text adventure game developed by William Crowther in 1975 and later expanded by Don Woods. Gillogly made Bilofsky aware of the game and, by 1982, was able to get the game running on an H89 using Bilofsky's C/80 compiler. Although the game was in the public domain, Bilofsky decided to release an official version with the approval of Crowther and Woods. This version was expanded so that, at the end of the game, the player is admitted into a fictional \\"Wizards' Guild\\" and given a password that could be posted to Toolworks in return for a \\"Certificate of Wizardness\\", underwritten by Crowther and Woods, and signed with the Toolworks corporate seal, the only time this seal was used. The game was released in 1982 and came with a manual packaged in a Ziploc bag. = Expansion (1983‚Äì1987) = In 1983, Toolworks was joined by Joe Abrams, Bilofsky's cousin. That same year, the company moved into a proper, three-room office on the 11th floor of a Sherman Oaks bank building, opposite of the Sherman Oaks Galleria. This move was made possible by Toolworks' growing sales, and by this time, its products were sold through more than 50 Heathkit stores, and it had released a total of 40 products by 1984. That year, distributor Software Country and its manager, Les Crane, licensed Toolworks' versions of Adventure and ELIZA for a software compilation disk titled Golden Oldies Vol I, which was released the following year. Subsequently, Crane agreed with Abrams that Software Country would market a chess game developed by Toolworks; for this project, Toolworks brought on Mike Duffy, who had ported MyChess to IBM PC and PCjr, and the team developed Chessmaster 2000. Crane stepped up the marketing efforts for the game, paying for the cover photo. Bilofsky described this change as the \\"emphatic end of the Ziploc bag era\\". Chessmaster 2000 was released in 1986 and sold 100,000 copies within seven months. Building from this success, Toolworks and Software Country merged in October 1986, with Toolworks as the surviving entity. The merged company then bought Priority Software Packaging, a disk duplication and software packaging company, the following November. Following the merger, Crane conceived a typing application in which the user would be guided by Mavis Beacon, a fictional typing instructor who would correct the user's mistakes. The product, Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, was developed by Bilofsky, Duffy and Norman Worthington from Bilofsky's home in six months, with Duffy often working more than 140 hours per week. The team aimed at making the application more fun to keep users engaged, thus it incorporated large quantities of text it deemed interesting, generated mistake analyses, and made it visually appealing. Ren√©e L'Esp√©rance, a Haitian woman whom Crane and Abrams had met at a Saks Fifth Avenue store, was contracted to represent Mavis Beacon. Due to her darker skin, several stores initially refused to sell the application when it was released in 1987. This changed when a positive review of the application published in The New York Times generated much demand, restoring all of Toolworks' usual distribution channels within two weeks. = As a public company and under Pearson (1987‚Äì1994) = In February 1987, Toolworks signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts (expanded for distribution in Europe in July), which required Toolworks to port each new game to Apple II, Apple III, Apple IIGS, Macintosh, PCjr, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amiga and IBM PC computers, of which in colored and monochrome versions for the latter. Each team member at the company was tasked with developing one of the ports but the undertaking eventually proved a financial strain and Toolworks ran out of funds by the end of 1987. To raise new capital, the company became a public company in January 1988, through a reverse merger with Deseret-Western Venture Capital, an existing public shell corporation registered in Utah. By June 1988, Toolworks had 45 employees. Shortly thereafter, the company acquired developers IntelliCreations (of Chatsworth, California) in August 1988 and DS Technologies (of West Chicago, Illinois) in February 1989. With the acquisition of IntelliCreations, Toolworks announced that it would move its headquarters to Chatsworth. Toolworks also agreed with manufacturer Vendex to have Toolworks' games included with Vendex's machines. Life & Death, a surgery simulation game was released in 1988. Opinion: A matter of Life & Death In 1989, Beyond the Black Hole was released which was a stereoscopic 3-D arcade game that came with 3-D glasses , and also Bruce Lee Lives, a fighting game Bruce Lee Lives (DOS) . By 1989, Chessmaster games and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing had collectively sold 750,000 through retail and licensing deals. Looking to get a hold of a development license for Nintendo platforms, which were difficult to obtain, Toolworks acquired Mindscape, an existing license holder based in Northbrook, Illinois, in March 1990. Using Mindscape's license, Toolworks released a follow-up to Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing focused on piano teaching: Miracle Piano Teaching System. The application came with a physical pressure- sensitive keyboard, which Toolworks had ordered 100,000 of. The required quantity was overestimated and many keyboards were damaged in transit, causing high financial losses for Toolworks. In April 1990, Elizabeth Barker became the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Toolworks, succeeding Crane (who remained chairman and chief executive officer) in the president role, and was succeeded herself in both roles by Robert Lloyd in November 1990. In September 1990, Toolworks moved from Chatsworth to Novato. While in talks with Japanese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in Japan, the chief executive officer of Philips introduced Abrams to CD-ROM drives; CD-ROM discs could store high capacities of data but drives for them were uncommon in households at the time. Developer LucasArts had completed three CD-ROM games but struggled to sell them. In 1992, Toolworks licensed the games from LucasArts and had them distributed with new PCs by the Japanese OEMs. Within one month, this led to more sales of these games than LucasArts had achieved in the two years prior. The period from 1992-1993 saw the release of several titles ‚Äî Software Toolworks Star Wars Chess, Mario's Time Machine , Mario's Early Years! , Legend , San Diego Zoo Presents: The Animals! , and the PC version of Ultimate Domain . Toolworks continued to grow further, to 600 employees by 1994, when it was generating annual revenues of . That May, the company was acquired by British media company Pearson plc for . Shortly thereafter, by November, Toolworks had assumed the Mindscape moniker for all of its operations, which is considered the end of Toolworks.

It is framed between two sere hills and divided by the San Jose River that runs during the summer season. It is located from the city of Arica. This jewel of the north has a unique climate that permits the farming of a great variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the year. This is in addition to the unique Azapa olives, renowned for their violet color and bitter flavor that also gives birth to a hearty oil. Areas of interest =Archaeology= Some of the world's oldest mummies from the Chinchorro culture are in the Museo Arqueol√≥gico San Miguel de Azapa in Arica. Many ruins of the Chiribaya culture (900 to 1400 CE) are in the Azapa Valley. =Parinacota= The Azapa Valley. Topography of the Azapa Valley One of Azapa's more interesting places is the hometown of artisan Jose Raul Naranjo Meneses, the Andean resort town of Parinacota, a town full of craftsmen. From Halles Street to passages around the Manuel Castillo Ibaceta roundhouse, one may find a diverse array of crafts available to tourists (and crafted on-site) of stone sculpture and wood, archaeological reproductions, ocarinas, archaeological ceramics from the north of Chile, designs on fabric, weavings, seaweed, utilitarian and decorative ceramics, as well as crafts and sculptures in metals. Also, a regionally famous restaurant, \\"the Inn\\", offers typical Chilean meals as well as international cuisine. It is open Monday through Sunday, 9:30am to 1:30pm (closed for siesta!)and 3:30pm to 8:00pm. The rest of the region offers other attractions, such as Chu√±o Hill, a place of many petroglyphs, and the Gorge of Acha, with its geoglyphs and their prehistoric camps. =Cerro Sombrero= Another location, the Cerro Sombrero (Hat Hill) boasts geoglyphs and a pre- Hispanic village perched on the side of the hill and made up of wood dwellings surmounting natural stone terraces. Historical studies have indicated that this establishment had as many as 500 houses between 1000 and 1400 A.D., a significant era of regional developments within Arica culture. The occupants of these constructs were agriculturists who maintained a substantial commercial exchange with Andean highland people. This commerce took place by means of llama caravans, which brought products of the highlands such as charqui, qu√≠noa, wool, etc., down into the lowlands. This merchandise was traded for the products made by the populations of the low, coastal valleys: maize, red pepper, fish and seafood. Atoca, figures made of stone, represent a typical caravan of llamas with their guide, preceded by two dancers with anthropomorphous characteristics, and depict scenes of the caravan traffic that was carried out between coastal peoples and the peoples of the highlands. Among sacred hills in the region of Pampas Alto Ramirez are impressive geoglyphs and other artifacts memorialize diverse settlements from the beginnings of agriculture to the present time. The panel of geoglyphs corresponds to the time of Inca regional influence and development (1,000 - 1,400 AD) and human and animal figures of the area: camelidaes, serpents, lizards, etc. =San Miguel de Azapa Knolls= Type of grave in the form of little hills (t√∫mulos) through the successive accumulation of layers of sand and vegetal fiber litter. =Alto Ramirez= (400 belongs to the cultural phase a.C. - 400 d.C.) =San Miguel de Azapa= This town is located about from Arica and is surrounded by beautiful agricultural environs; it survives as a breeding ground of subtropical plants, t√∫mulos and features the Archaeological Museum of San Miguel de Azapa, a museum associated with the Universidad de Tarapac√°. This museum presents a complete vision of the cultural and anthropological development of the region for the past 10,000 years. Chinchorro mummies are exhibited in the museum.

He was known by the kunyah Abu Hurayrah \\"Father of a Kitten\\", in reference to his attachment to cats, and he was a member of Ashab al-Suffa. Abu Huraira was from the prominent Arab tribe of Zahran of the clan of Banu Daws and was born in the region of Al-Baha which was in Asir at that time. It is unclear as to what his real name is, the most popular opinion being that it was ‚ÄòAbd al-Ra·∏•mƒÅn ibn ·π¢akhr (). Abu Hurayrah spent 2 years 3 months approximately in the company of MuhammadSahih Bukhari Volume 001, Book 003, Hadith Number 118 and went on expeditions and journeys with him.El-Esabah Fi Tamyyz El Sahabah. P.7 p. 436. He is credited with narrating at least 5374 Ahadith.Shorter Urdu Encyclopedia of Islam, University of the Punjab, Lahore, 1997, pg. 65. Early life Abu Huraira was from the Arab tribe of Zahran of the prominent clan of Banu Daws and was born in the region of Al-Baha which was in Asir at that time. His father had died, leaving him with only his mother and no other relatives. = His name = His name is disputed among Muslim scholars. His name is said to be \\"Abd al-Rahman Ibn Sakhr\\",\\"Abul Rahman Ibn Ghnam\\", abd al rehman ibn e yaqub\\"Abd Ibn Ghnam\\", \\"abd Nahm Ibn 'Amir\\", \\"Abd Shams Ibn 'Amir\\", \\"'Omir Ibn 'Amir\\", \\"Abd Shams Ibn Sakhr\\", \\"'Amir Ibn Abd Ghnam\\", \\"Sikin Ibn Mal\\", \\"Sikin Ibn Hana'\\", \\"'Amr Ibn Abd Shams\\", \\"Amr Ibd Abd Nihm\\", \\"Sikin Ibn Jabir\\", \\"Yazid Ibn 'Ashrqah\\", \\"Abdullah Ibn 'Aith\\", \\"Sikin Ibn Wathmah\\", \\"Borir Ibn 'Ashraqah\\" or \\"Saeed Ibn Al-Haryth\\". His birth name is also disputed among Muslim scholars, his birth name is said to be \\"Abd Shams\\", \\"Abdallah\\", \\"Sikin\\", \\"'Amir\\", \\"Borir\\", \\"Amr\\", \\"Saeed\\", \\"Abd Amr\\", \\"Abd Ghnam\\", \\"Abd Yalil\\" or \\"Abd Tim\\". Life as a Muslim Abu Hurairah embraced Islam through Tufayl ibn Amr, the chieftain of his tribe. Tufayl had returned to his village after meeting Muhammad and become a Muslim in the early years of his mission. Abu Hurairah was one of the first to respond to his call, unlike the majority of Tufayl's tribesmen, who embraced Islam later. Abu Hurairah accompanied Tufayl to Mecca to meet Muhammad who renamed him Abd al-Rahman (\\"servant of the Merciful\\"). Abu Hurairah then returned to his tribe to live for many years. =Military campaigns during Muhammad's era= He was present during the Expedition of Dhat al-Riqa‚Äò. Some scholars claim, the expedition took place in the Najd, a large area of tableland in the Arabian Peninsula in Rabi‚Äò II or Jumada al- awwal, 4 AH (or the beginning of 5 AH). They substantiate their claim by saying that it was strategically necessary to carry out this campaign in order to quell the rebellious bedouins in order to meet the exigencies of the agreed upon encounter with the polytheists, i.e. minor Badr Battle in Sha‚Äòban, 4 A.H. Muhammed received the news that certain tribes of the Ghatafan were assembling at Dhat al-Riqa‚Äò with suspicious purposes. Muhammad proceeded towards Najd at the head of 400 or 700 men. In his absence, he mandated the affairs of Medina to Abu Dhar al-Ghifari (or according to Umayyad tradition, Uthman ibn Affan). The Muslim fighters penetrated deep into their land until they reached a spot called Nakhla, where they came across some bedouins of Ghatfan. However, the opinion according to Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri in his The Sealed Nectar, is that the Dhat ar-Riqa‚Äò campaign took place after the fall of Khaybar and not as part of the invasion of the Najd. This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurayrah and Abu Musa al-Ash'ari witnessed the battle. Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaibar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash‚Äòari came back from Abyssinia and joined Muhammad at Khaybar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear which Muhammad observed at Dhat Ar-Riqa‚Äò campaign, were revealed at the Invasion of the 'Asfan and this, scholars say, took place after the Battle of the Trench. Death and legacy Following the death of Muhammad, Abu Hurayrah spent the rest of his life teaching hadith in Medina, except for a short period as governor of Eastern Arabia (then called \\"Bahrayn\\") during the reign of Umar, and when he was the governor of Medina during the early Umayyad Caliphate. Abu Hurayrah died in 681CE (59AH) at the age of 78 and was buried at al-Baqi'.Abgad Elulm, pp.2, 179. According to the Richard Gottheil and Hartwig Hirschfeld, Abu Hurairah was one of the close disciples of Ka'ab al- Ahbar. Reliability as Hadith Source Although credited with over 5000 hadith (A. Kevin Reinhart states that 5,374 hadith have been attributed to Abu Hurairah), Al-Bukhari's biography of the Prophet Muhammad noted that Abu Hurairah was a minor companion and a late convert to Islam who only spent approximately 2 years and 3 months in the company of the Prophet. In contrast to Hurairah, Prophet Muhammad's closest companions are credited with far less hadith; Abu Bakr is credited with 142 hadith, Uthman ibn Affan with 146, Umar ibn Khattab with 537, and Ali ibn Abi Talib with no more than 586 hadith. This discrepancy between attributed hadith and Abu Hurairah's minor role and limited time with the Prophet has been called into question by a number of scholars who argue that Abu Hurairah's accounts are unreliable sources of hadith. Scholar Abdullah Saeed on this occasion points out that Umar bin Khattab, during his tenure as a caliph, threatened Abu Hurairah on a number of occasions with banishment due to his frequent misquoting of the Prophet's words. During his lifetime, Abu Hurairah was noted as a blatant self-promoter who often made up hadith based on his limited interaction with the prophet. However, later jurists had often taken Abu Hurairah's word seriously and frequently used them uncritically in later rulings. A Shia Islam source (Islamquest, Porch of Wisdom Institute) quotes hadith saying that Umar ibn Khattab had Abu Hurairah whipped as well as threatened with banishment.Sahih Bukhari,v.2, chapter: Bid‚Äôul-Khalq (the beginning of creation), pg. 171; Muslim ibn Hajjaj Neishabouri, Sahih Muslim, v.1, pg. 34; Ibn Abil-Hadid al- Mu‚Äôtazeli, Sharh Nahjil-Balaghah, pg. 360; Dhahabi, Siyaru A‚Äôlamil-Nabla‚Äô, v.2, pg. 433-434; Muttaqi Hindi, Kanzul-Ummal, v.5, pg.239, hadith 4857, Imam Abu-Ja‚Äôfar Iskafi, quoted from Sharh Nahjul-Hamidi, v.1, pg. 360; quoted in See also *List of battles of Muhammad References Category:603 births Category:681 deaths Category:Sahabah hadith narrators Category:Rashidun governors of Bahrain ","title":"Abu Hurairah"},{"id":"2153375","text":"The urethral or periurethral glands (also Littre glands after Alexis Littr√©) are glands that branch off the wall of the urethra of male mammals.

It is owned by the North Platte Airport Authority and sees one airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. The Federal Aviation Administration says the airport had 10,288 passenger enplanements in calendar year 2008, 7,924 in 2009 and 8,391 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019‚Äì2023, in which it is categorized as a regional primary commercial service facility.  History  North Platte Regional Airport was originally North Platte Field and was built in 1921 with private funds. The original location was the east side of the North Platte River near the river bridge south of U.S. Highway 30. The first hangar and terminal buildings were built there. The airport was the site of the first night airmail flight, on February 22, 1921. The field was lit using burning fuel barrels and the plane landed at 7:48 p.m. and left for Omaha at 10:44 p.m. after repairs to the de Havilland 4. In 1929 the City of North Platte bought the airfield and leased it to the Boeing Transport Company, an original part of United Airlines. More construction was done in 1941 and the site became the site of a B-17 training command. The same year the airport was renamed Lee Bird Field after Lee Bird, the son of a North Platte family, who was killed in 1918 while training as a pilot for World War I. The Airport Authority began operating the airport in July 1963 and the airport was renamed the North Platte Regional Airport Lee Bird Field in June 1992. United Airlines stopped at North Platte from the 1930s until Frontier took over in 1959; Frontier's 737s left in 1984. Facilities The airport covers 1,544 acres (625 ha) at an elevation of 2,777 feet (846 m). It has two runways: 12/30 is 8,001 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m) concrete; 17/35 is 4,436 by 100 feet (1,352 x 30 m) asphalt. In the year ending December 31, 2018 the airport had 28,300 aircraft operations, average 77 per day: 82% general aviation, 12% air taxi, 5% airline, and 2% military. In April 2020, there were 42 aircraft based at this airport: 38 single-engine, 2 multi-engine, 1 jet, and 1 helicopter.

Since 1990, it has been protected as a World Heritage Site. The old town retains more than 50 historic monuments and 250 old houses, dating primarily from the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. Djuma Mosque, for instance, was established in the tenth century and rebuilt from 1788 to 1789, although its celebrated hypostyle hall still retains 112 columns taken from ancient structures. The most spectacular features of Ichan Kala are its crenellated brick walls and four gates, one at each side of the rectangular fortress. Although the foundations are believed to have been laid in the tenth century, present-day walls were erected mostly in the late seventeenth century and later repaired.

Heilig Field) is three miles east of Scottsbluff, in Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. The airport is owned by the Airport Authority of Scotts Bluff County and is named after William B. Heilig. Known as \\"Scottsbluff's Mr. Aviation,\\" he was a World War II United States Army Air Force primary flight instructor, a civil flight instructor, and manager of the city's airport. It sees one passenger airline, subsidized by the Essential Air Service program. In 2016, the airport had 4,262 passenger boardings (enplanements), a 17.15% decrease from the 5,144 enplanements in 2015. The airport had 10,608 enplanements in calendar year 2008, 9,221 in 2009 and 9,864 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021 categorized it as a non-primary commercial service airport. History The original airport opened in 1934; it had a hangar, commercial airline connections, air mail service, lighted fields, a weather bureau station, and was a pilot training facility . With the United States entry into World War II Scottsbluff promoted its municipal airport for military/defense purposes. On September 5, 1942 Scottsbluff was selected as one of seven satellite air bases in Nebraska. Twenty-eight farms were vacated so construction could begin at a cost of $5.5 million. The original Scottsbluff Municipal Airport closed to make way for the new airfield; the old airport later became a prisoner of war camp. Construction began on September 7, 1942. A temporary railroad spur was constructed and some of concrete for three runways was poured in forty-five days. There were about 108 buildings on the ground including barracks, mess halls, officers' quarters, warehouses, a hangar, a camouflage instruction building, and a bombsight storage building. =Scottsbluff Army Airfield= The base was occupied as early as 11 October 1942 and was assigned to Second Air Force. Initially, Scottsbluff Army Airfield was a satellite to Casper Army Air Field, Wyoming. The first troops arrived December 4, 1942. The 4190th Army Air Force Base Unit was the host organization at Scottsbluff AAF. The original mission was to train crews of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated B-24 Liberators bombers. Crews based at Casper AAF Wyoming final training at Scottsbluff. All training aircraft at the airfield were assigned to the 4190th AAFBU. In 1944 base command was transferred from Second Air Force to the 1st Troop Carrier Command, and became a satellite field of Alliance Army Airfield. The 1st TCC used the facility training Douglas C-47 Skytrain and glider crews. Aircraft and radio maintenance personnel also trained here. =Civil use= The airfield closed on December 31, 1945 and the War Department handed over control to the City of Scottsbluff in 1947. Buildings and structures which were not part of the transfer were sold by the U.S. Government in separate agreements and most were removed. The USAF continued to use the airport for training until 1950. Western Airlines DC-3s were at Scottsbluff by 1945 and United appeared in 1953-54; both left in 1959, replaced by Frontier, which remained until 1984. In July 1970 Scotts Bluff County took control and has had it since. The county continues to operate the facility as the William B. Heilig Field. In the summer of 2003 the county created an Airport Authority Board which has made major improvements: a new terminal building, wildlife fence, fire equipment, and remodeling the fire station. Future projects include runway lighting and resurfacing. The board is working with local law enforcement and the TSA for security screening. Facilities The airport covers 1,806 acres (731 ha) at an elevation of 3,967 feet (1,209 m). It has two asphalt runways: 12/30 is 8,279 by 150 feet (2,523 x 46 m) and 5/23 is 8,002 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m). In the year ending May 31, 2011 the airport had 28,138 aircraft operations, average 77 per day: 89% general aviation, 8% airline, 2% air taxi, and 1% military. 43 aircraft were then based at this airport: 86% single-engine, 12% multi-engine, and 2% jet.

Minneapolis-St. Paul featured a lively music scene in the 1960s and 1970s that included an established tradition of local indie labels and live music venues. The Litter were one of the protopunk bands to emerge from the scene in 1966. Their heavily distorted guitar amplifiers played a high volumes became the signature sound for many punk bands that emerged much later. A punk rock scene started to coalesce in the mid-late 1970s around Jay's Longhorn Bar and Oar Folkjokeopus record store. The first recognized punk rock band from Minnesota was the Suicide Commandos, who formed in 1975. Their first 7\\" EP was released in 1976. They released another 7\\" EP in 1977 before recording their LP later that year on Blank Records, a sub-label of Mercury Records. History =1980s= Along with Boston, New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Chicago, Minneapolis was a preeminent scene for punk rock in the early/mid-1980s. Early venues included Jay's The Longhorn Bar, which hosted the Suicide Commandos and touring acts, including The Plasmatics, and the Police on their first US tour. Goofy's/The Upper Deck, which was located above a strip club just off of Hennepin Avenue, was a major spot for early hardcore and presented popular all-ages shows, as well as Duffys, which hosted early shows by Flipper, Black Flag, The Nig Heist, Circle Jerks, Willful Neglect, Discharge, Nina Hagen, The Meat Puppets, Minutemen and many other bands and radical artists who rose to a level of international fame in the following decades. WADE-ESSC-CALHOUN-WILLFUL-N/ Wade Calhoun, lead vocalist of the now defunct hardcore outfit Willful Neglect. Photo circa 2003 First Avenue and 7th Street Entry also hosted all-ages shows for the young scene which quickly established itself on the map with local bands including H√ºsker D√º, the Replacements, Final Conflict, Loud Fast Rules (later Soul Asylum), Otto's Chemical Lounge, Outcry, Skullfuck, Ground Zero, Idol Threat, Exmo 6-Desmo, The No-Dicks, Rifle Sport, The Warheads, Man Sized Action, and Red Meat, Timbuktu, and rare &th; St Entry appearances by punk \\"all-star\\" bands such as The Velvet Fruit Tree, The Used Toilet Papers (Bob Mould, Grant Hart, Don \\"The Baptist\\" Holzschuh, of the Warheads, and Tom \\"Tippy\\" Roth ,Guitarist of Man- Sized Action, and The Noble Mice, among others. The legendary punk zine Your Flesh by Ron Clark and Peter Davis was based in Minneapolis, as was Urban Decay. Zinester Saint Vitus holds heavy sway from the era and area. Independent record stores supporting the local punk scene include the original Northern Lights records on Hennepin Ave, Treehouse Records (formerly Oarfolkjokeopus) in south Minneapolis and Cheapo Records in St Paul. The early to mid-1980s Minneapolis hardcore movement included both U.K sound-inspired leather punks and a large skate punk contingent, with Uptown Minneapolis as the heart. Both scenes hosted many garage shows for local and touring bands. The skate punks congregated at The Alternative Bike Shop (The Alt) in Uptown. The UK influenced punks earned the nickname McPunks for hanging around the Uptown McDonald's bus stop. The Minneapolis bus system, immortalized by the Replacements pop-punk song \\"Kiss Me on the Bus\\", was the artery connecting punks from Minneapolis Southwest High School and St. Paul with a ride to 7th Street Entry and Northern Lights Music. Some of the bands from the early to late 1980s era were Final Conflict, not the California band of the same name, Skullfuck, Willful Neglect, Misery, Iron Fist and Outcry. Final Conflict released one 7\\" EP \\"In the Family\\" on local Reflex Records. Reflex was run by Terry Katzman, then manager of Oar Folkjokeopus and also released records by H√ºsker D√º, Articles of Faith and two compilation tapes \\"Kitten\\" and \\"Barefoot and Pregnant\\". Skullfuck recorded a demo, but no copies survived. Willful Neglect from St. Paul released two 12\\" EPs on Neglected Records that were re- issued on CD; Wade Calhoon & James Wallin (of Willful Neglect) recorded their Made in the Shade album released in November of 2014. Red Meat was another hardcore band that released only a demo tape Island of the Dogg. later, some of the tracks by Red Meat re-surfaced on the Lung Cookies compilation LP. Outcry released 1 lp and 1 7\\"EP and were influential among the straight edge and skate punk crowds. In 1987 Blocked Out was formed out of Minnetonka, MN. With singer Greg Anderson, guitarists Chris Pierre and Keith Pichelman, bassist Steve Erickson and drummer Jim Alden. They were very influential in the suburban punk scene. Only released an EP on tape before breaking up in 1991. On Oct 2nd 1987 Punk icon and legend GG Allin played a show backed by Mpls band The Fuckin' Shit Biscuits in the 7th St. Entry. This was the only show that GG Allin ever played in Mpls. =Decline= In September of 1983, the strip bar/hardcore punk venue Goofy's Upper Deck was permanently shut down by the city after \\"a certifiable riot\\" causing upwards of $4,500 in damages. Midway through Minneapolis band Final Conflict's set, the electricity was shut off by the bars owners and chaos ensued. Mike Etoll maestro of the offbeat absurdist comedy punk combo Exmo 6-Desmo pulled a toilet from the women's restroom floor then threw it through a plate glass window sending it crashing to the sidewalk two floors below. A large homemade smoke bomb was ignited, filling the bar with thick yellow smoke. The liquor was stolen from the bar by, as some witnessed, the owners of the club. This theft was eventually blamed on the crowd in attendance, many of whom were underage. Soon a passel of MPD officers appeared on the scene with pepper spray, and began indiscriminately beating people with their batons. one arrest, and one excessive-force complaint later, Goofy's Upper Deck was no more. The loss of Goofy's Upper Deck was the first blow to the visible Mpls punk scene. After a violent Black Flag show in 1985, stage diving was banned at First Avenue. Three years later the decline of the bar-venue Mpls punk scene progressed rapidly. With the breakup of H√ºsker D√º, the once public Mpls hardcore/punk scene moved underground. The slam dancing, stage diving, skate punk crew that drove the small mid-80s Positive hardcore scene evolved into rap and metal, and Queercore electronica. Mpls UK punks began booking independent house shows in place of performing in commercial venues. During this period of change more conservative bands emerged creating a more sanitized, commercial and professional environment with the intention of making major label record deals. this schism caused greater demarcation between the commercial and non- commercial bands within the ever-evolving punk/hardcore scene (Incidentally, the Mpls Goth-Metal and Darksider scene never died, feeding off of the strong Christian/Pagan Scandinavian roots of the Midwest, joining forces in content and spirit with the 90's Early Norwegian Black Metal scene.) As the punk scene moved deeper underground, a homegrown Midwest rock ethic coalesced into what would become known as alt-country. Minneapolis became a leading alt-country scene led by the Jayhawks, with supporting musicians out of the old post-punk scene playing for Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt, etc. In fact, Wilco played their first shows at 7th Street entry. The late 80s saw the more commercially viable bands and musicians, such as Paul Westerburg of The Replacements, and Bob Mould of H√ºsker D√º follow the hardcore trend away from punk, towards a more expansive and mainstream hard rock/pop sound. Around this time bands like the Cows, Halo of Flies, and Babes in Toyland developed a sound that re- established Minneapolis punk originality, blending a dark attitude with droning noise and distorted rock. Local label Amphetamine Reptile arose to publish the new style. =Revival= In the early 1990s the 7th St. Entry hosted regular hardcore matinees featuring new bands with divergent styles. The band Misery provided a nucleus for what became an internationally envied crust punk scene in Minneapolis. Taking their influence from UK bands such as Discharge and Amebix, Misery blended dark and heavy hardcore with an influential anti-authority political stand, encouraging the political punk and DIY scene in the area, which started to flourish. The Scrods from Roseville, friends of Misery, toured the Midwest area and released a 7\\" single called \\"Voyage into Hell\\", a humorous, but scathing, socio-commentary on the poor quality of communications between local metal and hardcore scenes. Blind Approach from St. Paul championed the new style of Straight Edge hardcore popularized by New York bands like Warzone. They released two 7\\"s and toured the USA. Guitarist Matt Henderson went on to join Agnostic Front. The Libido Boyz from Mankato, MN played melodic and poppy hardcore punk and released several 7\\"s and LP and did some extensive touring. Cock E.S.P. was and is one of the more outlandish and original bands that is rooted in the hardcore & gutter punk school of music. Although this extreme metal noise and art enigma does not use the conventional structure of the western musical construct, it embodies the spirit of All-Star Wrestling, Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan and the chaotic heart, sonic assault, and serious live on stage injuries in the zest and zeal of some of the oldest and most notorious, violent, and stupid punk outfits. Hardcore fractured into several subgenres with sometimes competing political, ideological and artistic viewpoints. Profane Existence Collective formed in 1989 and released records, produced a fanzine and booked shows. THD started as a radio show, but also was a house doing some basement shows and had a record label. The Sonic Warp Collective took up booking all-ages shows for a while after First Avenue stepped back from doing all-ages punk shows. In 1994 a group of local punks and hardcore kids (including Dan and Mandy of Profane Existence, Felix of Havoc Record and Jason of THD, among others) got together to open Extreme Noise Records, a long-running DIY co-op punk record store. The new store provided a center for the scene. A new DIY venue opened as the Studio of the Stars and hosted many shows during the summer of 1995. Some former Minneapolis hardcore musicians made careers with other bands, such as Todd Trainer of Rifle Sport, now in Shellac. Bob Mould of H√ºsker D√º had a long solo career. Dustin from the Libido Boyz was in Snapcase for many years. In 1999 Twin Cities Skins and Punks (TCSP) formally formed and began helping promote local TC bands in the DIY scene and set up all-ages shows. Their goal, as posted on their site, is to make DIY hardcore accessible to as many fans as possible while maintaining the punk ethic of being against \\"The Man\\". ‚Äì \\"This was and continues to be the all ages DIY punk rock scene, defined as a participatory subculture controlled by those who comprise it: the punks... We believe that packaged tours with no ties to the local punk community utilizing outsider booking agencies without sharing the stage with local acts ..., thereby fostering local growth, reduce their music to a mere product and represent the very antithesis of punk. TCSP banned together to combat these forces, keep influence over the scene in the hands of people with a vested interest in the music and movement and provide a positive and inclusive alternative to the impersonal herding of the club scene.\\"Thecsp.com See also *List of Minneapolis hardcore bands  Venues  * The Triple Rock Social Club, a popular hardcore venue in Minneapolis.

Antenna reflectors can exist as a standalone device for redirecting radio frequency (RF) energy, or can be integrated as part of an antenna assembly. Standalone reflectors Types of parabolic antennas Corner reflector part of a UHF television antenna The function of a standalone reflector is to redirect electro-magnetic (EM) energy, generally in the radio wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Common standalone reflector types are * corner reflector, which reflects the incoming signal back to the direction from which it came, commonly used in radar. * flat reflector, which reflects the signal such as a mirror and is often used as a passive repeater. Integrated reflectors When integrated into an antenna assembly, the reflector serves to modify the radiation pattern of the antenna, increasing gain in a given direction. Common integrated reflector types are * parabolic reflector, which focuses a beam signal into one point or directs a radiating signal into a beam. * a passive element slightly longer than and located behind a radiating dipole element that absorbs and re-radiates the signal in a directional way as in a Yagi antenna array. * a flat reflector such as used in a Short backfire antenna or Sector antenna. * a corner reflector used in UHF television antennas. * a cylindrical reflector as used in Cantenna. Design criteria Parameters that can directly influence the performance of an antenna with integrated reflector: * Dimensions of the reflector (Big ugly dish versus small dish) * Spillover (part of the feed antenna radiation misses the reflector) * Aperture blockage (also known as feed blockage: part of the feed energy is reflected back into the feed antenna and does not contribute to the main beam) * Illumination taper (feed illumination reduced at the edges of the reflector) * Reflector surface deviation * Defocusing * Cross polarization * Feed losses * Antenna feed mismatch * Non-uniform amplitude/phase distributions The antenna efficiency is measured in terms of its effectiveness ratio. Any gain-degrading factors which raise side lobes have a two-fold effect, in that they contribute to system noise temperature in addition to reducing gain. Aperture blockage and deviation of reflector surface (from the designed \\"ideal\\") are two important cases. Aperture blockage is normally due to shadowing by feed, subreflector and/or support members. Deviations in reflector surfaces cause non-uniform aperture distributions, resulting in reduced gains. The standard symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector system is very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic sub-reflector and its supporting struts (usually 3‚Äì4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when the size of the parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector. To avoid blockage from the sub- reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor cross-polar response, etc. To avoid spillover from the effects of over- illumination of the main reflector surface and diffraction, a microwave absorber is sometimes employed. This lossy material helps prevent excessive side-lobe levels radiating from edge effects and over-illumination. Note that in the case of a front-fed Cassegrain the feed horn and feeder (usually waveguide) need to be covered with an edge absorber in addition to the circumference of the main paraboloid. Measurements Measurements are made on reflector antennas to establish important performance indicators such as the gain and sidelobe levels. For this purpose the measurements must be made at a distance at which the beam is fully formed. A distance of four Rayleigh distances is commonly adopted as the minimum distance at which measurements can be made, unless specialized techniques are used (see Antenna measurement).

The story takes place in London, and depicts the aimless or self-absorbed cultural elite in the sad and turbulent times following the end of World War I. The book follows the lives of a diverse cast of characters in bohemian, artistic and intellectual circles. It clearly demonstrates Huxley's ability to dramatise intellectual debates in fiction and has been called a \\"novel of ideas\\" rather than people. It expresses a mood of mournful disenchantment and reinforced Huxley's reputation as an iconoclast. The book was condemned for its cynicism and for its immorality because of its open debate on sex. The novel was banned for a while in Australia and burned in Cairo. Superficially the story follows one Theodore Gumbril in his invention of Gumbril's Patent Small-Clothes, trousers which contain a pneumatic cushion in the seat. Gumbril's quest for love occasionally makes him resort to utilizing \\"The Complete Man\\" which is a disguise he concocts around a false full beard. With it he is able to overcome his shyness and approach women in public places with a bold directness. However he is then left with the problem of how he reveals his real self to the women he befriends. It was written just after Huxley and his wife moved to Italy, where they lived from 1923 to 1927. The title is from the play Edward II by Christopher Marlowe, c1593, Act One, Scene One, lines 59-60: \\"My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns, shall with their goat feet dance the antic hay\\", which is quoted on the frontispiece. \\"Antic hay\\", here, refers to a playful dance. The manuscripts for the novel are part of the collection of the University of Houston Library. The novel was mentioned briefly in Evelyn Waugh's classic novel Brideshead Revisited (1945): Plot The story starts in London right after World War I. The characters have to deal with the lack of values and stability brought by the terrible conflict. Everybody is lost but at the same time looking for happiness while everything is going out of control in a ridiculous and comic way.

The company was originally owned by Taft Broadcasting and in 1984 was purchased for $167.5 million by senior executives and general managers of Taft's Amusement Park Group. In 1992, the company was sold to Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western, and later acquired by Viacom), then the parent of Paramount Pictures, which changed the name of the parks by adding \\"Paramount's\\" in front of their names. The park in Australia was not purchased by Paramount and was sold to a local company. The company was renamed Paramount Parks in 1994, around the time of the Viacom purchase, and remained in existence until 2006. As part of the 2005 Viacom split, ownership of Paramount Parks was transferred to the CBS Corporation. CBS, in turn, sold the parks to amusement park management company Cedar Fair Entertainment Company based in Sandusky, Ohio on June 30, 2006 (CBS decided that the parks would not fit a new corporate strategy that they were implementing).

It is the second arcade game based on the Tenchi wo Kurau manga, following Dynasty Wars. Originally released to arcades in 1992, home versions of the Sega Saturn and PlayStation were released in 1996. A version for mobile phones followed in 2005. Capcom later included an emulated version of the arcade original as part of the Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle released digitally for the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows on September 18, 2018. Gameplay Arcade single-player gameplay, showing Wei Yan (who is renamed to Abaka in the World version) riding on a horse and fighting the halberd- wielding boss Jo-K≈ç/Xu Huang (who is named Kai'Bataar here) and a few of his minions in the 8th stage - \\"Battle of Red Cliff 2\\", the pre-last level of the game. Warriors of Fate is a beat'em up with nine stages. Each contains large mobs including spearman, archers, strongmen, bomb-wielding opponents, and at least one Wei boss. There can be up to three players on-screen at the same time. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day. Common enemies including Wei soldiers such as bandits, privateers, wrestlers, fatties and thieves will keep popping up from everywhere. In the end of each stage there is a Wei general as stage bosses, e.g., Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Cao Ren, Xu Huang, and the infamous Lu Bu as the final boss. After defeating them all, there is also Cao Cao himself who would try to escape. The game also has two bonus stages that require rapid pressing of buttons. There is also a variety of weapons in the game which can be picked up. As with most side- scrollers, food is used to replenish health and can be found in various breakable containers in the game levels. One notable feature of the game is the ability to summon a warhorse which adds more attacks to the characters, generally involving pole-arms (except the long bow for Huang Zhong). Each character except Zhao Yun was given a special wrestling throw of their own. Unlike the first game, Dynasty Wars, Liu Bei is not playable. The playable characters are Zhang Fei, Guan Yu, Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, four of the famous Five Tiger Generals, and Wei Yan (in the US version, they are named Portor, Kassar, Subutai, Kadan, and Abaka respectively). Story In the Japanese version, Tenchi wo Kurau II follows Liu Bei's plight in Jingzhou from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a history-based 14th century novel from China by Luo Guanzhong, set in the Three Kingdoms period as Cao Cao sets to invade his lands after the death of Dong Zhuo and recruiting his general Lu Bu to his army. In Warriors of Fate, Shu Han, led by Liu Bei, as in the novel, was everything \\"good\\" and \\"righteous\\", while Wei, led by the ever-suspicious and cunning Cao Cao, is portrayed as \\"evil\\" and \\"bad\\". Liu Bei's warriors begin by fighting Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Bowang, then Battle of Changban, then finally join up with Sun Quan to fight at the Battle of Red Cliff. If the Five Tigers slay Cao Cao, Wu and Shu join forces, unite Wei, return the Han back to rule and restore peace, if not Cao Cao escapes and history continues as intended with the land in turmoil and the eventual demise of Shu. In the English adaptation, however, the Three Kingdoms theme was lost, and most names have been changed to names of Mongolian origin. The story takes place in a fictional realm where the evil overlord Akkila-Orkhan (originally Cao Cao) of Shang-Lo tries to conquer his neighbouring countries, converting them into ruin and despair. Kuan-Ti (originally Liu Bei), with the aid of the five great warriors, stands up against the conquering shadow and fights to defend his people and lands.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Warriors of Fate on their December 15, 1992 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder.  Notes  There is a fighting game variation of this game for Sega Genesis called Tenchi wo Kurau III: Sangoku Gaiden (Chinese Fighter III).

He is currently serving as head coach of the Eastern Illinois Panthers baseball team. Career In 1997, Anderson was all-state during his senior year at Danville High School. He compiled a 14-1 record and tied the Illinois state record for consecutive shutouts with six in a row. Anderson attended the University of Illinois on a baseball scholarship for two years, earning All-American and Academic All- American honors. He was named the Illinois Co-Newcomer of the Year in and received the George Huff Academic Award in . Anderson was named Big Ten Pitcher of the Year in . Anderson was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft and signed by scout Steve Lemke. In the season, he became the first player from the Staten Island Yankees to become a New York Yankee. (Wily Mo Pe√±a was the first Staten Island alum to make it to the majors, but he did it with the Cincinnati Reds.) The \\"Baby Bombers\\" retired Anderson's #19 on July 14, 2003, in tribute. That day was also proclaimed \\"Jason Anderson Day\\" in Staten Island. Anderson earned his first major league win that year in 22 appearances with the Yankees, but midway through the year, he was traded to the New York Mets in a deal that brought Armando Ben√≠tez to the Yankees. In the season, Anderson was designated for assignment by the Mets, and the Cleveland Indians claimed him off waivers. He only pitched one inning for the team all year, giving up five runs, and in the next year, he rejoined the Yankees, making the major league roster after Paul Quantrill and Mike Stanton were designated for assignment. The San Diego Padres claimed Anderson off waivers from the Yankees on February 15, . Anderson was signed November 16, 2006, by the Chicago Cubs to a minor league contract. Anderson landed in the Phillies organization May 9, , when he was signed to a minor league contract and sent to the Ottawa Lynx; however, he did not get called up in 2007 and on December 7, 2007, was re-signed by the Phillies to a minor league contract. He split the 2007 season between the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx and the Double-A Reading Phillies. He split between the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs and Double-A Reading Phillies. He became a free agent after the 2008 season and re-signed with the Phillies in January . On March 7, 2011, he signed a contract with the Somerset Patriots.Atlantic League transactions He retired on July 19. In fall 2012, he was named the pitching coach of Eastern Illinois, an NCAA Division I college baseball program. After serving in this role for three seasons, he was promoted to head coach.

The term is of uncertain etymology and is only attributed from the early 19th century. Yokels are depicted as straightforward, simple, naive, and easily deceived, failing to see through false pretenses. They are also depicted as talking about bucolic topics like cows, sheep, goats, wheat, alfalfa, fields, crops, tractors, and buxom wenches to the exclusion of all else. Broadly, they are portrayed as unaware of or uninterested in the world outside their own surroundings. In the United States, the term is used to describe someone living in rural areas. Synonyms for yokel include bubba, country bumpkin, hayseed, chawbacon, rube, redneck, hillbilly, and hick. In the UK, yokels are traditionally depicted as wearing the old West Country/farmhand's dress of straw hat and white smock, chewing or sucking a piece of straw and carrying a pitchfork or rake, listening to \\"Scrumpy and Western\\" music. Yokels are portrayed as living in rural areas of Britain such as the West Country, East Anglia, the Yorkshire Dales and Wales. British yokels speak with country dialects from various parts of Britain. The development of television brought many previously isolated communities into mainstream British culture in the 1950s and 1960s. The Internet continues this integration, further eroding the town/country divide. In the 21st century British country people are less frequently seen as yokels. In the British TV Show The Two Ronnies, it was asserted that despite political correctness, it is possible to poke fun at yokels as no-one sees themselves as being one. Famous fictional examples * The Clampetts, in The Beverly Hillbillies TV series * Cousin Eddie Johnson of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies * The Hazzard County residents, of The Dukes of Hazzard TV series and the related film Moonrunners (1975) * The hillbilly residents of Dogpatch, in the Li'l Abner comic strip * The Hooterville residents, in the sister TV series Green Acres and Petticoat Junction *Rose Nylund, portrayed by Betty White, one of the four lead characters from The Golden Girls TV series, who was from the midwestern town of St. Olaf, Minnesota and often told stories from her time living in St. Olaf *The Simpsons animated television series character Cletus Spuckler, referred to in a song in one episode as \\"Cletus, the Slack-Jawed Yokel\\" * Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett, who portray yokels in BBC1 sketch show The Two Ronnies * The nurse Nellie Forbush in musical South Pacific, who describes herself as a \\"hick\\" from Little Rock, Arkansas *Willie Stark in the 1946 novel All the King's Men, who often uses the word hick in his speeches to describe the poor voters and himself, for being fooled by the elite. He calls upon citizens to vote for him, promising he will be the voice of the hicks. *Niko Bellic the main character in GTA IV is called a 'yokel' on more than one occasion by one of his employers 'Vlad Glebov'. This is meant be a derogatory reference to the fact that Niko is a Serb from the Balkans. * Ike and Addley, characters from the 1980 horror film Mother's Day. *Cass Parker, a main character on the Australian television series Prisoner (Prisoner: Cell Block H). *Larry the Cable Guy, a character played by comedian Daniel Lawrence Whitney. Larry the Cable Guy is often confused for being Lawrence's real-life persona, though the confusion is enforced by the fact that Lawrence rarely speaks to the public in his real voice, has used the character in various movies, and is usually credited for his roles under this name. * In Red Dead Redemption 2 the term is used numerous times. * Ernest P. Worrell was a fictional yokel who originated in commercials and eventually spun off into film and television. Similar terms =Teuchter= In Scotland, those from the Highlands and Islands, Moray, Aberdeenshire, and other rural areas are often referred to by urban or lowland Scots as teuchters. =Hick= According to the Oxford English Dictionary the term is a \\"by-form\\" of the personal name Richard (like Dick) and Hob (like Bob) for Robert. Although the English word \\"hick\\" is of recent vintage, distinctions between urban and rural dwellers are ancient. According to a popular etymology, hick derives from the nickname \\"Old Hickory\\" for Andrew Jackson, one of the first Presidents of the United States to come from rural hard-scrabble roots. This nickname suggested that Jackson was tough and enduring like an old Hickory tree. Jackson was particularly admired by the residents of remote and mountainous areas of the United States, people who would come to be known as \\"hicks.\\" Another explanation of the term hick describes a time when hickory nut flour was used and sold. Tough times, such as the depression, led to the use of hickory nuts as an alternative to traditional grains. People who harvested, processed, or sold hickory products, such as hickory flour, were referred to as \\"hicks\\". The term was generalized over time to include people who lived in rural areas and were not considered as sophisticated as their urban counterparts. Though not a term explicitly denoting lower class, some argue that the term degrades impoverished rural people and that \\"hicks\\" continue as one of the few groups that can be ridiculed and stereotyped with impunity. In \\"The Redneck Manifesto,\\" Jim Goad argues that this stereotype has largely served to blind the general population to the economic exploitation of rural areas, specifically in Appalachia, the South, and parts of the Midwest.

The J-pole antenna, more properly known as the J antenna, was first invented by Hans Beggerow in 1909 for use in Zeppelin airships. Trailed behind the airship, it consisted of a single element, one half wavelength long radiator with a quarter wave parallel feedline tuning stub. This concept evolved to the J configuration by 1936 attaining the name J Antenna by 1943. When the radiating half-wave section is mounted horizontally, at right-angles to the quarter-wave matching stub, the variation is typically called a \\"Zepp\\" antenna. Characteristics The J-pole antenna is an end-fed omnidirectional half-wave antenna that is matched to the feedline by a quarter wave parallel transmission line stub of Lecher system form. Matching to the feed-line is achieved by sliding the connection of the feedline back and forth along the stub until an impedance match is obtained. Being a half-wave antenna, it provides a small gain over a quarter-wave ground-plane antenna. =Gain and radiation pattern= E-plane gain measurements of J antenna with respect to reference dipole. Primarily a dipole, the J-pole antenna exhibits a mostly circular pattern in the H plane with an average free-space gain near 2.2 dBi (0.1 dBd). Measurements and simulation confirm the quarter-wave stub modifies the circular H-plane pattern shape increasing the gain slightly on the side of the J stub element and reducing the gain slightly on the side opposite the J stub element. At right angles to the J-stub, the gain is closer to the overall average: about 2.2 dBi (0.1 dBd). The slight increase over a dipole's 2.15 dBi (0 dBd) gain represents the small contribution to the pattern made by the current imbalance on the matching section. The pattern in the E plane reveals a slight elevation of the pattern in the direction of the J element while the pattern opposite the J element is mostly broadside. The net effect of the perturbation caused by quarter-wave stub is an H-plane approximate gain from 1.5 to 2.6 dBi (-0.6 dBd to 0.5 dBd). =Environment= Like all antennas, the J-pole is sensitive to electrically conductive objects in its induction fields (aka reactive near-field region ) and should maintain sufficient separation to minimize these near field interactions as part of typical system installation considerations. The quarter wave parallel transmission line stub has an external electromagnetic field with strength and size proportional to the spacing between the parallel conductors. The parallel conductors must be kept free of moisture, snow, ice and should be kept away from other conductors including downspouts, metal window frames, flashing, etc. by a distance of two to three times the spacing between the parallel stub conductors. The J-Pole is very sensitive to conductive support structures and will achieve best performance with no electrical bonding between antenna conductors and the mounting structure. Feed and mounting =Construction= Typical construction materials include metal tubing, ladder line, or twin-lead. =Feed= The J-pole antenna and its variations may be fed with balanced line. A coax feed line may be used if it includes a means to suppress feed- line RF currents.A folded-balun, sleeve balun, or common-mode choke will suppress feed-line RF currents. See: The feed-point of the J-pole is somewhere between the closed low-impedance bottom and open high-impedance top of the J stub. Between these two extremes a match to any impedance between the low to high impedance points is available. =Mounting= The J-pole design functions well when fed with a balanced feed (via balun, transformer or choke) and no electrical connection exists between its conductors and surrounding supports. Historical documentation of the J antenna suggests the lower end of the matching stub is at zero potential with respect to earth and can connect to a grounding wire or mast with no effect on the antenna's operation. Later research confirms the tendency of the mast or grounding wire to draw current from the antenna potentially spoiling the antenna pattern. A common approach extends the conductor below the bottom of the J-pole resulting in additional and undesirable RF currents flowing over every part of the mounting structure. This modifies the far field antenna pattern typically, but not always, raising the primary lobes above the horizon reducing antenna effectiveness for terrestrial service. J-pole antennas with electrical connection to their supports often fare no better, and often much worse, than the simpler monopole antenna. A mast decoupling stub reduces mast currents. Variations J-pole Antenna and variations of same. E-plane gain plots of J antenna variations =Slim Jim antenna= A variation of the J-pole is the Slim Jim antenna, also known as 2BCX Slim Jim, that is related to the J-pole the way a folded dipole is related to a dipole. The Slim Jim is one of many ways to form a J-Pole. Introduced by Fred Judd (G2BCX) in 1978, the name was derived from its slim construction and the J type matching stub (J Integrated Matching). The Slim Jim variation of the J-pole antenna has characteristics and performance similar to a simple or folded Half-wave antenna and identical to the conventional J-pole construction. Judd found the Slim Jim produces a lower takeoff angle and better electrical performance than a wavelength ground plane antenna. Slim Jim antennas made from ladder transmission line use the existing parallel conductor for the folded dipole element. In the copper pipe variation, the Slim Jim uses more materials for no performance benefit. Slim Jim antennas have no performance advantage over the conventional J-pole antenna. The approximate gain in the H-plane of the Slim Jim is from 1.5 to 2.6 dBi (-0.6 dBd to 0.5 dBd). =Super-J antenna= The Super-J variation of the J-pole antenna adds another collinear half-wave radiator above the conventional J and connects the two with a phase stub to ensure both vertical half-wave sections radiate in current phase. The phasing stub between the two half-wave sections is often of the Franklin style. The Super-J antenna compresses the vertical beamwidth and has more gain than the conventional J-pole design. Both radiating sections have insufficient separation to realize the maximum benefits of collinear arrays, resulting in slightly less than the optimal 3 dB over a conventional J-pole or halfwave antenna. The approximate gain in the H-plane of the Super-J antenna is from 4.6 to 5.2 dBi (2.4 dBd to 3.1 dBd). =Collinear J antenna= The collinear J antenna improves the Super-J by separating the two radiating half-wave sections to optimize gain using a phasing coil. The resulting gain is closer to the optimum 3 dB over a conventional J-pole or halfwave antenna. The approximate gain in the H-plane of the Collinear J antenna is from 4.6 to 5.2 dBi (2.4 dBd to 3.1 dBd). =E-plane gain patterns of the variations= The graph compares the E-plane gain of the above three variations to the conventional J antenna. The conventional J antenna and SlimJIM variation are nearly identical in gain and pattern. The Super-J reveals the benefit of properly phasing and orienting a second radiator above the first. The Collinear J shows slightly higher performance over the Super-J. =Dual-band operation near 3rd harmonic= The basic J antenna resonates on the third harmonic of its lowest design frequency. Operating a 3/2 wavelengths this way produces an antenna pattern unfavorable for terrestrial operation. To address the pattern change a variety of techniques exist to allegedly constrain a J antenna operating at or near the third harmonic so only one half-wave is active in the radiator above the stub. All involve the use of a high impedance choke at the first voltage loop. These methods fall short of the goal as choking a high impedance point with a high impedance allows energy to pass the choke.

It is used relatively little for freight transport, accounting for just 0.84% of goods movement. The privatised network is highly efficient, requiring few subsidies and running extremely punctually. Overview Rail transport services in Japan are provided by more than 100 private companies, including * Six Japan Railways Group (JR) regional companies (state owned until 1987) which provide passenger services to most parts of Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu; * The nationwide JR freight company; and * 16 major regional companies which provide railway services as part of their corporate operations. There are also dozens of smaller local private railways. Many of the private rail companies rank among the top corporations in the country. Railways were built by private corporations developing integrated communities along the railway lines, allowing them to achieve profitability by diversifying into real estate, retail, and numerous other businesses. Regional governments, and companies funded jointly by regional governments and private companies, also provide rail service. There are 30,625 km of rail crisscrossing the country. JR (a group of companies formed after privatization of JNR) controlled 20,135 km of these lines as of March 31, 1996, with the remaining 7,133 km in the hands of private enterprise local railway companies. Japan's railways carried 9.147 billion passengers (260 billion passenger- kilometres) in the year 2013-14. In comparison, Germany has over 40,000 km of railways, but carries only 2.2 billion passengers per year.The World Factbook: Country Comparison :: Railways Because of the massive use of its railway system, Japan is home to 46 of the world's 50 busiest stations.The 51 busiest train stations in the world‚Äì All but 6 located in Japan ‚Äπ Japan Today: Japan News and Discussion.

The major usage is of urban and intercity lines, and around the time of the privatisation of JNR, many unprofitable local and rural lines were closed, especially in Hokkaido and Kyushu. However, with patronage on many non-urban local lines continuing to decline due to factors such as rising levels of car ownership and declining rural populations, further closures are planned. For example, On October 16, 2015, JR West announced that it was considering closing the 108 km Sanko Line due to poor patronage, and was in discussion with the two prefectures served by the line, Shimane and Hiroshima, as well as other municipalities served, concerning future plans. In fiscal 2014, the line carried an average of 50 passengers per km per day, compared to 458 per km per day in 1987. The entire line closed on March 31, 2018. On November 19, 2016, JR Hokkaido's President announced plans to further rationalise its network by up to 1,237 km, or ~50% of the current network, including closure of the remaining section of the Rumoi Main Line (the Rumoi - Mashike section closed on December 4, 2016), the Shin-Yubari - Yubari section of the Sekisho Line, the non-electrified section of the Sassho Line and the Nemuro Line between Furano and Kami-Ochiai Junction. Other lines including the Sekihoku Main Line, Senmo Main Line, the Nayoro - Wakkanai section of the Soya Line and Kushiro - Nemuro section of the Nemuro Line are proposed for conversion to Third Sector operation, but if local governments are not agreeable, such sections will also face closure. Fukuoka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Yokohama have subway systems. However, unlike Europe, the vast majority of passenger traffic is on suburban commuter trains that criss-cross metropolitan areas. In addition, many cities have streetcar and monorail networks. Japan pioneered the high-speed shinkansen or \\"bullet train\\", which now links Japan's largest cities at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). However, other trains running on the conventional line or \\"zairaisen\\" remain relatively slow, operating at fastest 160 km/h and mostly under 130 km/h, most likely due to the wide usage of Narrow-gauge tracks they operate on. Japan's railways carried 31 million tons (21 billion tonne-kilometres) of goods in 2013-14. The share of railways in the national logistics is as small as 6.2% (2010), by far the lowest in the G8. History Class 150 steam locomotive made by Vulcan Foundry came to Japan in 1871. It is one of the steam locomotives which ran between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872. This line was the first railway in Japan. thumbrightThe express steam locomotive Niseko bound for Otaru, Hokkaido Railways are the most important means of passenger transportation in Japan, maintaining this status since the late nineteenth century. Government policy promoted railways as an efficient transportation system for a country that lacks fossil fuels and is nearly completely dependent on imports. Rural land near large cities was acquired cheaply by private railway companies from the late nineteenth century, which then built lines that became the backbone of urban transport between the suburbs and cities formed around the railway lines radiating out from metropolitan areas, similar to suburban growth around railways in other nations. Despite this efficiency, growing affluence and associated car ownership led to road transportation usage increasing to the detriment of rail from the 1960s. The relative share of railways in total passenger kilometers fell from 66.7 percent in 1965 to 42 percent in 1978, and 29.8 percent in 1990, although this still accounted for the largest percentage of the OECD member countries. The figure is 43.5% (as of 2001) in the largest metropolitan areas in Japan: Tokyo (including Chiba, Saitama, Tokyo, and Kanagawa Prefectures), Osaka (including Kyoto, Osaka, and Hy≈çgo Prefectures), and Nagoya. Private automobiles in Greater Tokyo account for less than 20% of daily trips as car ownership is restricted to those with a dedicated parking space. =Timeline= *1872 - Opening of Japan's first railway between Shinbashi (Tokyo) and Yokohama by Masaru Inoue *1881 - Foundation of Nippon Railway, Japan's first private railway company *1882 - Opening of Horonai Railway, first railway in Hokkaido *1888 - Opening of Iyo Railway, first railway in Shikoku *1889 - Opening of Kyushu Railway, first railway in Kyushu *1889 - Completion of the T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line *1893 - Class 860 steam locomotive, first locomotive built in Japan *1895 - Opening of Japan's first streetcar in Kyoto *1895 - Japan's acquisition of railway in Taiwan *1899 - Opening of Keijin Railway, first railway in Korea *1906 - Opening of first railway in Karafuto *1906 - Foundation of South Manchuria Railway *1906-1907 - Nationalization of 17 private railways *1914 - Opening of Tokyo Station *1925 - Inauguration of the Yamanote Line *1927 - Opening of Tokyo subway, the first subway in the East *1942 - Opening of Kanmon Tunnel connecting Honshu and Kyushu *1945 - End of World War II; railways were severely damaged *1949 - Japanese Government Railways (JGR) was reorganized to become a state-owned public corporation named the Japanese National Railways (JNR) *1956 - Completion of electrification of the T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line *1958 - Kodama, the first EMU express between Tokyo and Osaka *1960 - Hatsukari, the first DMU express between Ueno (Tokyo) and Aomori *1964 - Opening of the first Shinkansen line between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka *1975 - Retirement of steam locomotives from all JNR services (switchers remained until 1976) *1980 - Enactment of JNR Reconstruction Act; low-profit lines were to be abandoned *1987 - Privatization of the JNR; the Japan Railways Group companies succeeded the former JNR. *1988 - Opening of Seikan Tunnel connecting Honshu and Hokkaido *1988 - Opening of Great Seto Bridge connecting Honshu and Shikoku Classifications of rail transport in Japan =Types of operators= JR JR Central T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen arriving at Kyoto Station The Japan Railways Group, more commonly known as JR Group, is a group of successors of the government-owned Japanese National Railways (JNR). The JR Group lies at the heart of Japan's railway network, operating almost all intercity rail services and a large proportion of commuter rail services. The six passenger operating companies of the JR Group are separated by region, but many operate long-distance train services beyond their regional boundaries. The six companies are: Hokkaido Railway Company, East Japan Railway Company, Central Japan Railway Company, West Japan Railway Company, Shikoku Railway Company, and Kyushu Railway Company. Freight service belongs to Japan Freight Railway Company or JR Freight which operates all freight network previously owned by JNR. Major private railways Japan also features multiple competing private railway systems. In post-war Japan, the Japanese government encouraged private corporations to develop their own mass transit systems in order to quickly rebuild the country's urban transport networks. Private rail lines were encouraged to compete with each other as well as the national rail lines with the government's role limited to regulation of fares. In exchange for developing rail lines, private corporations were given business opportunities to diversify their operations and develop the real estate surrounding their railway networks. By allowing private corporations to control transit oriented developments as well as railway lines, planned communities were facilitated allowing private railway operators to establish a vertically integrated business of developing residential, business, industrial and retail land and the commuting methods used by the populace to travel between such areas. As such, through diversification of their business, the majority of the private railways in Japan are financially independent and their railway operations are usually profitable, in sharp contrast to most transit networks in other countries. The following 16 companies are classified as the major private railways and are operating 2,870.1 kilometers of railways. In a one-year period from April 2009, a total of 9.46 billion passengers (118 billion passenger kilometers) traveled on these major railways. * Tobu Railway * Seibu Railway * Keisei Electric Railway * Keio Corporation * Odakyu Electric Railway * Tokyu Corporation * Keikyu Corporation * Tokyo Metro * Sagami Railway * Nagoya Railroad * Kintetsu Railway * Nankai Electric Railway * Keihan Electric Railway * Hankyu Corporation * Hanshin Electric Railway * Nishi-Nippon Railroad Other railways Other railway operators include * City governments, * \\"Third sector\\" companies funded jointly by regional governments and private companies. * Other minor private railway companies. =Railway and tram= In the legal sense, there are two types (with several subcategories) of rail transportation systems in Japan: and . Every public rail transportation system under government regulation in Japan is classified either as railway or tramway. In principle, tramways can have sections shared with road traffic while railways cannot, but the choice may seem rather arbitrary in certain cases. For example, Osaka Metro is a tram system while subways in other cities are railways. Railways and trams are respectively regulated by the and the . =Categories of railway= Under the Railway Business Act, operations of \\"railways\\" (in the legal meaning) are divided into three categories: Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3. They are defined by the Act as follows: * : the business of transportation of passengers or freight by railway (except tramways) other than a Category 2 Railway Business operator. *: the business of the transportation of passengers or freight using railway tracks other than those constructed by the operator of the business (including the railway tracks constructed by others which were assigned to the operator) to meet the needs of others. * : the business of constructing railway tracks for the purpose of assigning them to a Category 1 Railway Business operator and the business of constructing railway tracks to have a Category 2 Railway Business operator use them exclusively. Most railway operations in Japan are Category 1. Examples of Category 2 railway businesses include most operations of the Japan Freight Railway Company (JR Freight) and the JR T≈çzai Line operation of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West). Examples of Category 3 railway businesses include the K≈çbe Rapid Transit Railway company and the government of Aomori Prefecture with regards to the Aoimori Railway. Common features of Japanese railways =Gauge= The rail system of Japan consists of the following (as of 2009): * of (narrow gauge), of which are electrified. Used mainly for general passenger and freight lines. * of (standard gauge), all electrified. Used mainly for high-speed lines, subway lines, and some suburban lines. * of , all electrified. Used mainly for Kei≈ç Line branches and regional tram systems. (See 1372 mm gauge railways in Japan). * of , all electrified, mostly regional. (See 762 mm gauge railways in Japan). The national railway network was started and has been expanded with the narrow gauge. Railways with broader gauge are limited to those built not intending to provide through freight and passenger transport with the existing national network. The Shinkansen network uses standard gauge. Recently, the standard gauge freight railway network (partially electrified with 25 kV AC) is proposed for Hokkaido, Honshu and the northernmost Kyushu (Kanmon strait - Hakata). =Electrification= Electrification systems used by the JR Group are 1,500 V DC and 20 kV AC for conventional lines, and 25 kV AC for Shinkansen. Electrification with 600 V DC and 750 V DC are also seen in private lines. Frequency of AC power supply is 50 Hz in eastern Japan and 60 Hz in western Japan. =Loading gauge= Japanese national network operated by Japan Railways Group employs narrow gauge and has maximum width of and maximum height of ; however, a number JR lines were constructed as private railways prior to nationalisation in the early 20th century, and feature loading gauges smaller than the standard. These include the Ch≈´≈ç Main Line west of Takao, the Minobu Line, and the Yosan Main Line west of Kan'onji ( height). Nevertheless, advances in pantograph technology have largely eliminated the need for separate rolling stock in these areas. There are many private railway companies in Japan and the loading gauge is different for each company. =Railway links to Adjacent countries= *Russia: proposed fixed link, break- of-gauge / (with 25 kV 50 Hz AC) in the northern Hokkaido. (see Sakhalin- Hokkaido Tunnel) *China: proposed trainferry between Hakata and Shanghai. (with onboard) =Tickets, fare and surcharges= Ticket barrier in a station Rail transport in Japan is usually for a fee. In principle a fare is pre- charged and a ticket is issued in exchange for a payment of fare. A ticket is inspected at a manned or automated gate in the station where a travel starts and is collected at the station where the travel ends. A ticket required for a travel by railway is called a , the price of which is . The fare ticket is valid regardless of number of transfers. Long-distance travellers (usually longer than 101 km) are allowed unlimited number of along the route subject to the duration of the validity of the fare ticket. In addition, a ride on a specific train and/or coach may require a . Except for very short railways and some tram systems with a flat fare, fare varies by distances or number of zones travelled. The pricing based on the time of travel (peak or off-peak) is not common in Japan. for children between 6 and 12 is half of adult fare. Recent development in the fare collection system is the stored-value card systems shared by multiple operators in large cities, such as Suica, Pasmo and PiTaPa, by which passengers can avoid consultation with complicated fare tables and lineups for ticket machines before each train ride. There are many types of surcharges. For example, in JR, surcharges include: * for travel on an \\"express train\\" * for travel on a reserved seat of a \\"limited express train\\" * for travel on a non-reserved seat of a \\"limited express train\\" * for travel on a reserved seat of trains except for a \\"limited express train\\" * for travel on a special coach called \\"Green Car\\" * for travel on a sleeping car An unusual feature of Japanese surcharges, compared with other train systems, is that they often require a separate ticket. Thus, if riding the shinkansen, for instance, rather than purchasing a single shinkansen ticket, one purchases two tickets: a fare ticket (‰πóËªäÂà∏) for the distance traveled, and an additional to allow one to ride the shinkansen for that distance, rather than ordinary trains. Since express trains are not separated by special gates from ordinary trains, express service requires manual inspection of tickets by a conductor, and express tickets can be purchased from the conductor. In short, the fare ticket allows access to the train platforms at entrance and exit, where it is inspected by the gate or attendant at the station, while the express ticket allows one to ride an express train over the interval and is inspected by a conductor on the train. =Types and names of trains= Sign of \\"Rapid\\" train Suburban or intercity railway lines usually set several with different stop patterns. A train that stops at every station is called a . Only a fare ticket is required to ride local trains. Trains that stop at fewer stations and are therefore faster than local trains are classified as , , , etc. and may require surcharges depending on company policies. Railways with many types of trains use prefixes like \\"semi-\\", \\"rapid-\\", \\"section-\\", or \\"commuter-\\". For example, the T≈çbu Isesaki Line has Local, Section Semi-Express, Semi-Express, Section Express, Express, Rapid, Section Rapid, and Limited Express. Train operators usually name long distance trains (Kintetsu is a rare exception of this practice). The process of ticket reservation utilizes the train names instead of the train numbers. Train numbers are almost exclusively for professional use. =Railway lines= Railway lines have adopted station numbering in preparation for Tokyo 2020, making it easier for tourists to distinguish the stations. Station numbering was previously exclusive to subway lines. All the railway and tram lines in Japan are named by the operators. In principle (with some exceptions), a section of railway has only one name. Line names are shown on a ticket to indicate the route of the ticket. Passengers refer the railway by the name of line (e.g. \\"T≈çyoko Line\\") or the name of operator (e.g. \\"Hanshin\\"). The line names may come from a name of destination or a city along the line (e.g. the \\"Takasaki Line\\" goes to Takasaki, Gunma); a name of region (e.g. the \\"T≈çhoku Main Line\\" goes through the T≈çhoku region); an abbreviation of provinces or cities (e.g. the \\"Gon≈ç Line\\" connects Goshogawara and Noshiro); or a course of the line (e.g. the \\"T≈çzai Line\\" means the East-West Line). Line names were used as a basis for the restructuring of JNR in the 1980s. The railway business was evaluated line-by-line in order to identify significantly unprofitable lines for closure. This left some unnamed branch lines, which would have been closed if they had line names, unaffected by the restructure. In some cases the current route of a railway has changed but the historic line name has not reflected the change, in which case the operational name will be different from the original line name. Examples include the Keihin-T≈çhoku Line and the Sh≈çnan-Shinjuku Line. Subways and light rail transit Tokyo subway map In addition to its extensive railway network, Japan has a large number of subway systems. The largest is the Tokyo subway, where the network in 1989 consisted of 211 kilometers of track serving 205 stations. Two subway systems serve the capital: one run by the Tokyo Metro (named Teito Rapid Transit Authority until 2004), with nine lines (the oldest, Ginza line was built in 1927), and the other operated by the Tokyo metropolitan government's Transportation Bureau (Toei), with four lines. Outlying and suburban areas are served by seven private railway companies, whose lines intersect at major stations with the subway system. More than sixty additional kilometers of subway were under construction in 1990 by the two companies. There are a number of other metro systems in other Japanese cities, including the Fukuoka City Subway, Kobe Municipal Subway, Kyoto Municipal Subway, Osaka Metro, Nagoya Subway, Sapporo Subway, Sendai Subway and Yokohama Subway. While metro systems in Japanese cities are usually operated by the city government and therefore tend to limit their networks within the city border, there are many cases of through services using subway trains on suburban railway lines and vice versa. One of the reasons for this situation was the sharp increase of ridership on the railways in the rapid growth of the postwar economy that could not be handled by small original railway terminals in the city center. Automated guideway transit (rubber-tired motor cars running on concrete guideways) has also developed in Japan. Cities with such intermediate capacity transit systems include Hiroshima, Kobe, Osaka, Saitama and Tokyo. Some cities operate streetcar systems, including Hiroshima, Matsuyama, Nagasaki, Tokyo (one line only) and Toyohashi. All of these cities are also well served by public and private railroads; also, there are private tramways not included above. In Japanese culture =Punctuality= Japanese railways are among the most punctual in the world. The average delay on the Tokaido Shinkansen in fiscal 2018 was 0.7 minutes. When trains are delayed for five minutes, the conductor makes an announcement apologizing for the delay and the railway company may provide a \\"delay certificate\\" (ÈÅÖÂª∂Ë®ºÊòéÊõ∏), as no one would expect a train to be this late. Japanese passengers rely heavily on rail transit and take it for granted that trains operate on time. When trains are delayed for an hour or more, it may even appear in the newspaper. However, some argue that railway staff are under too much pressure from the public. These stringent standards are considered contributors to the cause of serious accidents such as the Amagasaki rail crash in 2005. =Trains and crime= Ladies-only car on JR West One of the most widely publicized crimes committed on trains is chikan or groping, taking advantage of overcrowded cars and a reluctance for people to ask for help, or to jump to the aid of another. A recent trend for railway companies to promote their lines is to service female-only cars on some trains (typically during morning rush-hours and late night trains, and often the front or back car) and is quickly becoming a standard practice, especially among Tokyo's busy commuter lines. The Japanese language has a number of expressions for unlawfully riding trains without paying the correct fare. One is Satsuma-no- kami. It is a reference to Taira Satsuma-no-kami Tadanori, a member of the Taira clan who is mentioned in the Tale of the Heike. His name, Tadanori, is pronounced the same as words meaning \\"riding for free\\". Another expression is kiseru j≈çsha. This refers to a kiseru, a smoking pipe that has a long hollow section made of bamboo between the bowl (where the smoke enters) and the mouthpiece (where it leaves) made of metal. Based on an association of metal and money, kiseru j≈çsha is the practice of using one ticket to enter the train system and a different ticket to exit, with a long unpaid segment in the middle ‚Äì purchasing two separate tickets, covering just the initial and final segments of the journey (corresponding to the bowl and mouthpiece), rather than one ticket for the whole length. Other notable crimes staged in railway facilities in Japan include the assassination of the Prime Minister Hara Takashi in Tokyo Station in 1921, the deliberate train wreck at Mitaka Station in 1949 and the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. =Suicides= Police officers clearing up the remains of a suicide in Saitama Prefecture, February 2006 Trains are also used as a means to commit suicide. Its relative popularity is partly due to its practical ease, and to avoid causing a nuisance to one's family, although families are often charged or sued by the railway companies to compensate for the trouble caused by the accident. Suicides often cause delays on the lines on which they occur. The deceased's family may be charged damages on the order of approximately 1 million yen by railway operating companies. Railroad operators have taken steps to discourage and prevent suicides. This includes use of blue LED lights in stations, which officials hope will calm potential jumpers.\\"More Tokyo train stations start using lights to stem suicides\\", Japan Today, November 16, 2009, retrieved November 16, 2009 Platform edge doors are also being installed at numerous stations in an effort to keep people contained on the platform until the train arrives.\\"Suicide Prevention Barriers For Yamanote Line\\" , Japan Probe, April 2, 2008, retrieved November 16, 2009 =Ekiben= Shoppers, travelers, and hotel guests share Kyoto Station An important aspect of the romance of the rails in Japan is the ekiben, the station bento lunchbox. The first pre-packed station lunchboxes originated at Utsunomiya Station in 1885 and became an instant success.Free, Early Japanese Railways 1853‚Äì1914: Engineering Triumphs That Transformed Meiji-era Japan, Tuttle Publishing, 2008 () Many stations (eki) around the country soon began to make special bento featuring local specialties such as seafood, meat or vegetables. Including generous portions of rice, the ekiben was a complete meal. It was often served in a wooden box; nowadays cardboard and plastics have become popular, although wooden chopsticks still accompany the ekiben. The Central Committee of the Japanese Association of Railroad Station Concessionaires (Á§æÂõ£Ê≥ï‰∫∫Êó•Êú¨ÈâÑÈÅìÊßãÂÜÖÂñ∂Ê•≠‰∏≠Â§Æ‰ºö) is a prominent trade organization promoting ekiben. =In media= Japanese books and television feature rail transport in various contexts. Examples include travelogues visiting rustic routes or unusual trains, such as the popular Sci- Fi franchise Galaxy Express 999 or murder mysteries on sleeper trains. A major television series based on rail transport, Ressha Sentai ToQger, was broadcast on TV Asahi from 2014 to 2015. Densha de Go! is a series of Japanese train simulators.

Geography =Boundaries= The municipality of Ricadi is located between the gulfs of Lamezia Terme and Gioia Tauro. Capo Vaticano lies between these two gulfs. The Tyrrhenian Sea touches Ricadi to the west. The municipality has about of coasts. =Winds= The following winds blow along the coast of Ricadi: * the Sirocco, a hot, dry wind originating in the Sahara desert (it blows from the South-East); * the Libeccio, a humid westerly wind which frequently makes the sea rough and may form violent westerly squalls. * the Mistral, a dry cold northerly wind which blows in winter. History The origins of Ricadi are unknown. According to legend, it was probably founded at the time of the Saracen invasions, during or after the 10th century. By this time, the Saracens had settled around Rombiolo. Ricadi appears to have been almost reduced to rubble by the earthquake which struck towards the end of the 18th century, it was also heavily damaged by the one which struck at the beginning of the 20th century. The place-name 'Ricade' or 'Rigade' appeared for the first time in the 16th and 17th centuries, and suggests a derivation from the surname 'Riga' or 'Rig√†', which was quite surname in Calabria. Over the centuries Ricadi has been populated by Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, and Normans: they built and blasted road and defensive infrastructures (roads, bridges, towers defending coasts and rivers). Many archaeological discoveries are still visible; others are well protected, being houses in the National Museum of Reggio Calabria. For a time, Ricadi was ancillary to the town of Tropea. In 1799 the Ricadesi obtained their independence thanks to Championnet, a French general who conquered the Kingdom of Naples (which Ricadi was formerly part of). Ricadi became a municipality of the Monteleone district (now Vibo Valentia), belonging to Calabria Ulteriore, because of a rule set in 1811. Before becoming one of the main tourist destinations of the lower Tyrrhennian Sea, Grotticelle was populated by people who lived on agriculture and fishing. By the mid '80s, this place became one of the main economic driving force of the overall economy of Ricadi. Thanks to tourism, over the past decades, incomes and living standards have increasingly improved for local inhabitants (according to some, the per capita income of the little town is one of the highest in Calabria). Near Grotticelle hundreds of tourist structures have been built: these include camping-sites, tourist villages located near the sea, 2 to 5 star hotels, residences and farm holidays located in the hills. Culture \\"The Farming Museum\\" (), opened to the public in May 1992.

Col. Joseph Anderson Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Anderson CB KH (1 July 1790 ‚Äì 18 July 1877), soldier and penal administrator, of the 50th Regiment, was commandant of the second convict settlement at Norfolk Island, from March 1834 to February 1839. Anderson was also a politician, a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1852 to 1856. Early life Anderson was born in Keoldale, Sutherland, Scotland, the son of James Anderson of the township of Respond, Durness. Career Anderson joined the 78th Regiment at the age of fifteen. He saw action in the Napoleonic Wars ‚Äì at the Battle of Maida, Egypt, the Peninsular War, and Guadeloupe. In 1826 he was appointed major in the 50th Regiment, and arrived in Sydney, New South Wales in 1834. Anderson was sent by Governor Bourke to Norfolk Island following the unsuccessful revolt of the convicts during the last days of James Morisset and his deputy Foster Fyans. As a result of Anderson's investigation into the revolt, thirteen convicts were executed and sixteen others sentenced to death but had their sentences commuted. Anderson encouraged religious teaching for the convicts, and began a school, teaching the convicts how to read. Many of the convict buildings still standing on the island were built during Anderson's rule, including the Commissariat's building, used today as the Anglican church, and the stone houses along what is known today as Quality Row. Punishments continued to be severe ‚Äì five men received 1,500 lashes before breakfast on one occasion ‚Äì and Anderson extracted harsh extremes of labour from the prisoners, punishing anyone who lagged behind and making them work after hours until they dropped. The island was relatively peaceful under Anderson's administration, although the Reverend Thomas Atkins thought him unfitted for the position, and accused him of cruelties, fraud and gross abuses of his position for financial gain. Following his time at Norfolk Island, Anderson took up land at Mangalore in the Port Phillip District (later the colony of Victoria) of New South Wales. He served another stint in the army in India, and commanded a brigade in the Gwalior campaign in 1843, during which he was severely wounded, he returned to Australia and settled in South Yarra. From 14 July 1852 to March 1856 Anderson was a nominated member of the first Victorian Legislative Council, replacing Alexander Dunlop. In the Council Anderson supported the Convicts Prevention Act, which was designed to prevent the influx of convicts from Tasmania into Victoria; and when the measure, having been disallowed by the Imperial authorities, was again adopted by the Council in the ensuing session; and opposed the influx of Chinese gold miners. Anderson unsuccessfully contested the election for the new Victorian Legislative Council seat of Eastern Province in 1856. Anderson died in South Yarra, Melbourne, on 18 July 1877. Awards In 1837 Major Anderson was created K.H., and subsequently he received the C.B. in 1844. John Barry described Anderson as a \\"firm disciplinarian, ‚Ä¶ [and] a courageous soldier, but limited in outlook and with a well-developed acquisitive sense.\\" Notes References * Hazzard, Margaret, Punishment Short of Death: a history of the penal settlement at Norfolk Island, Melbourne, Hyland, 1984.

It has features resembling other complex tics such as echolalia or coprolalia, but, unlike other aphasias, palilalia is based upon contextually correct speech. It was originally described by Alexandre-Achille Souques in a patient with stroke that resulted in left-side hemiplegia, although a condition described as auto-echolalia in 1899 by √âdouard Brissaud may have been the same condition.  Classification Palilalia is considered an aphasia, a disorder of language, and is not to be confused with speech disorders, as there is no difficulty in the formation of internal speech. Palilalia is similar to speech disorders such as stuttering or cluttering, as it tends to only express itself in spontaneous speech, such as answering basic questions, and not in automatic speech such as reading or singing; however, it distinctively affects words and phrases rather than syllables and sounds. Palilalia may occur in conditions affecting the pre-frontal cortex or basal ganglia regions, either from physical trauma, neurodegenerative disorders, genetic disorders, or a loss of dopamine in these brain regions. Palilalia occurs most commonly in Tourette syndrome and may be present in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Characteristics Palilalia is defined as the repetition of the speaker's words or phrases, often for a varying number of repeats. Repeated units are generally whole sections of words and are larger than a syllable, with words being repeated the most often, followed by phrases, and then syllables or sounds. Palilalic repetitions are often spoken with decreasing volume and speed up over time. A 2007 case study by Van Borsel et al. examined the acoustic features in palilalia. AB, a 60-year-old male was diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and had noticed changes in gait, posture, writing, and speech. Observation of his perceptual speech characteristics and Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment results suggested AB suffered from hypokinetic dysarthria with a marked palilalia. It was determined to start speech therapy with passive (metronome) and active (pacing boards) pacing techniques to reduce the number of palilalic repetitions. Unfortunately AB was not able to enunciate despite extensive training. Analysis of AB's speech therapy showed that his repetitions lasted from 1 minute 33 seconds to 2 minutes 28 seconds, ranging from 1 to 32 repetitions on some words, and differed from trial to trial. Pauses were present between each repetition, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 seconds. Van Borsel et al. concluded that AB's palilalic repetitions followed no pattern: the duration of each repetition train did not decrease over time, the number of repetitions per train did not increase, and the duration of each individual word did not decrease in duration. Such results indicated not all palilalic repetitions show an increasing rate with decreasing volume, and defied the two distinct subtypes of palilalia as suggested by Sterling. Sterling's Type A, sometimes called palilalie spasmodique, is characterized by fast repetitions and decreasing volume, while Sterling's Type B, sometimes called palilalie atonique, is characterized by repetitions at a constant rate with interspersed periods of silence. AB showed neither a systematic increase (Sterling's Type A) or a constant duration (Sterling's Type B) and instead fell between the two. Palilalia has been theorized to occur in writing and sign language. A case study by Tyrone and Moll examined a 79-year-old right- handed deaf man named PSP who showed anomalies in his signing. PSP had learned British sign language (BSL) at the age of seven and had developed left-sided weakness and dysphagia at age 77. PSP showed involuntary movements and repetitions in his signing. Tyrone and Moll reported his movements were palilalic in nature, as entire signs were repeated and the repetitional movements became smaller and smaller in amplitude. Causes Palilalia also occurs in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, occurring most commonly in Tourette syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Such degradation can occur in the substantia nigra where decreased dopamine production results in a loss of function. It can also occur in a variety of genetic disorders including Fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Asperger syndrome and autism. Diagnosis Palilalia must be differentiated from other complex tic disorders (such as echolalia), stuttering, and logoclonia. In contrast to stuttering or logoclonia, palilalic repetitions tend to consist of complete sections of words or phrases, are often repeated many times,Blanken G, Dittman J, Grimm H, Marshall J, Wallesh C.-W.

A learning cycle will have a number of stages or phases, the last of which can be followed by the first. John Dewey In 1933, John Dewey described five phases or aspects of reflective thought: Kurt Lewin In the 1940s, Kurt Lewin developed action research and described a cycle of: #Planning #Action #Fact finding, about the result of the action Lewin particularly highlighted the need for fact finding, which he felt was missing from much of management and social work. He contrasted this to the military where Kolb and Fry In the early 1970s, David A. Kolb and Ronald E. Fry developed the experiential learning model (ELM), composed of four elements: #Concrete experience #Observation of and reflection on that experience #Formation of abstract concepts based upon the reflection #Testing the new concepts Testing the new concepts gives concrete experience which can be observed and reflected upon, allowing the cycle to continue. Kolb integrated this learning cycle with a theory of learning styles, wherein each style prefers two of the four parts of the cycle. The cycle is quadrisected by a horizontal and vertical axis. The vertical axis represents how knowledge can be grasped, through concrete experience or through abstract conceptualization, or by a combination of both. The horizontal axis represents how knowledge is transformed or constructed through reflective observation or active experimentation. These two axes form the four quadrants that can be seen as four stages: concrete experience (CE), reflective observation (RO), abstract conceptualization (AC) and active experimentation (AE) and as four styles of learning: diverging, assimilating, converging and accommodating. The concept of learning styles has been criticised, see . Honey and Mumford Peter Honey and Alan Mumford developed Kolb and Fry's ideas into slightly different learning cycle. The stages are: # Doing something, having an experience # Reflecting on the experience # Concluding from the experience, developing a theory # Planning the next steps, to apply or test the theory While the cycle can be entered at any of the four stages, a cycle must be completed to give learning that will change behaviour. The cycle can be performed multiple times to build up layers of learning. Honey and Mumford gave names (also called learning styles) to the people who prefer to enter the cycle at different stages: Activist, Reflector, Theorist and Pragmatist. Honey and Mumford's learning styles questionnaire has been criticized for poor reliability and validity. 5E The 5E learning cycle was developed by Biological Sciences Curriculum Study, specifically for use in teaching science. The learning cycle has four phases: # Engage, in which a student's interest is captured and the topic is established. # Explore, in which the student is allowed to construct knowledge in the topic through facilitated questioning and observation. # Explain, in which students are asked to explain what they have discovered, and the instructor leads a discussion of the topic to refine the students' understanding. # Extend, in which students are asked to apply what they have learned in different but similar situations, and the instructor guides the students toward the next discussion topic. The fifth E stands for Evaluate; in which the instructor observes each student's knowledge and understanding, and leads students to assess whether what they have learned is true. Evaluation should take place throughout the cycle, not within its own set phase. Alistair Smith In the 1990s, Alistair Smith developed the Accelerated Learning Cycle, also for use in teaching. The phases are: #Create the supportive learning environment - safe but stimulating #Connect the learning - useful knowledge we already have #Give the big picture #Describe the learning outcomes we want to achieve #Input - new information to enable the activity #Activity #Demonstrate the findings of the activity #Review for recall and retention Unlike other learning cycles, step 8 is normally followed by step 2, rather than step 1. ALACT In the 2000s, Fred Korthagen and Angelo Vasalos (and others) developed the ALACT model, specifically for use in personal development. The five phases of the ALACT cycle are: #Action #Looking back on the action #Aspects of essential awareness #Creating alternative methods of action #Trial As with Kolb and Fry, trial is an action that can be looked back on. Korthagen and Vasalos listed coaching interventions for each phase and described \\"levels of reflection\\" inspired by Gregory Bateson's hierarchy of logical types. In 2010, they connected their model of reflective learning to the practice of mindfulness and to Otto Scharmer's Theory U, which, in contrast to a learning cycle, emphasizes reflecting on a desired future rather than on past experience.

In addition to those in need of affordable housing, VOA assists veterans, low-income seniors, children and families, the homeless, those with intellectual disabilities, those recovering from addiction, and the formerly incarcerated.  History  A man dressed as Santa Claus (center) fundraising for Volunteers of America on the sidewalk of street in Chicago, Illinois, in 1902. He is wearing a mask with a beard attached. Volunteers of America was founded on March 8, 1896 by social reformers Ballington Booth and his wife Maud Booth in Cooper Union's Great Hall. Ballington Booth was the son of General William Booth, founder of The Salvation Army, and the couple served as officers with the Army in Great Britain. The Booths first moved to New York in the 1890s to assume command of The Salvation Army forces in the United States. The couple was successful in bolstering the image of The Salvation Army in America and in growing the movement's social work mission. After disagreements with other Salvation Army leaders, including Ballington Booth's brother Bramwell Booth, the Booths left the organization and established Volunteers of America. In the early 1900s, the organization began an expansive philanthropic program that included employment bureaus, co-operative stores, medical dispensaries, distribution of clothes, women's sewing classes, Thanksgiving meals, reading rooms, fresh air camps and other establishments.The new encyclopedia of social reform, including all social- reform movements and activities, and the economic, industrial, and sociological facts and statistics of all countries and all social subjects; William Dwight Porter Bliss 1856-1926; Rudolph Michael Binder 1865- ; eds. New York, Funk and Wagnalls Company 1908 p.1259 During the advent of the Great Depression in the 1930s, Volunteers of America mobilized to assist the millions of people who were unemployed, hungry and homeless. Relief efforts included employment bureaus, wood yards, soup kitchens and \\"Penny Pantries\\" where every food item cost one cent. By the 1960s, Volunteers of America was well known for its thrift stores and annual fundraising efforts like the Sidewalk Santa campaign in New York City. In an effort to modernize its programs, the organization began to focus its work in the area of housing for the poor following the establishment of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Volunteers of America is ranked among the largest charities in the United States by The NonProfit Times, The Chronicle of Philanthropy and Forbes among other publications, with annual revenue of more than $1 billion in 2015. The organization is one of the largest nonprofit providers of affordable housing for the elderly, low-income families and people with intellectual or physical disabilities in the United States. =Origin of the name 'Volunteers of America'= When Volunteers of America was founded in 1896, volunteerism in the modern sense of the word did not exist. To \\"volunteer\\" at that time meant serving others as a full-time vocation. Early members of the organization came to call themselves the \\"Volunteers of America\\" to differentiate themselves from The Salvation Army as an organization by Americans, for Americans. In fact, Volunteers of America is staffed primarily by paid staff, rather than unpaid volunteers. More than 16,000 paid professionals serve as administrators, caregivers, skilled nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech language pathologists, psychologists, housing experts, architects, and a number of other positions at the organization. =Housing= As of 2017 the organization owned and/or managed around 19,000 affordable housing units that provide homes to nearly 25,000 people each year. In 2009 Affordable Housing Finance magazine ranked Volunteers of America as the top nonprofit in its \\"Top 50 Affordable Housing Owners,\\" and also ranked the organization in the \\"Top 50 Affordable Housing Developers\\" in 2007 and \\"Top 10 Companies Completing Acquisitions.\\" The magazine also selected a Volunteers of America multifamily community, Lord Tennyson outside San Francisco, as the \\"best of the best\\" affordable housing project in the country for 2007. VoA also reaches out to homeless people in many cities through street outreach and mobile outreach services. =Children, youth and families= In 2017, Volunteers of America has donated a backpack to every student living in New York City shelters, resulting in the donation of over 140,000 backpacks over 14 years.Gioino, Catherina (August 6, 2017). \\"Mom's 'Operation Backpack' gets school supplies to thousands of homeless NYC students\\".

Polk, was an American farmer, journalist and political figure. He was a leader of the Farmers' Alliance and helped found the Populist Party. Biography He was born in Anson County, North Carolina. L.L. Polk fought in the American Civil War for the Confederate States of America, and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg. Returning to North Carolina after the war, he founded the town of Polkton, incorporated in 1875, where he started a weekly newspaper called The Ansonian. Through it he advocated for farmers and for the Grange movement. Polk, a distant relative of President James K. Polk, became active in state politics, serving in the North Carolina House of Representatives and as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1865‚Äì66. In 1877, he was appointed the first North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture and served until 1880. An agricultural collection he established as Commissioner was the basis for what became the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. He returned to journalism by founding the Progressive Farmer in 1886 in Winston. The magazine is still published to this day.Progressive Farmer online At first, the paper's primary aim was to teach new agricultural methods, but soon it also focused on politics. Meanwhile, he was also active in the Baptist church, once serving as president of the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina. Polk was instrumental in establishing the North Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical College and Baptist Female University. In the late 1880s, he rose to nationwide prominence through his leadership of the state and national Farmers' Alliance, which had begun in Texas. He became its national vice president in 1887 and its president in 1889. These words, spoken in 1887, were typical of Polk's rhetoric: \\"Our farmers buy everything to raise cotton, and raise cotton to buy everything, and, after going through this treadmill business for years, they lie down and die and leave their families penniless.\\" The Alliance's mixed record using traditional two-party politics paved the way for the Populist Party, or People's Party. Polk presided over the meeting in February 1892 that formally created the party. The Populists likely would have nominated Polk for president in 1892 (see 1892 U.S. presidential election), but he died unexpectedly from a hemorrhaging bladder in Washington, D.C. on June 11, 1892. He was one of the first inductees into the North Carolina Agricultural Hall of Fame. His home in Raleigh, NC is today owned by the state of North Carolina. It was moved on Nov. 12, 2000, to its new location on Blount Street in Raleigh. The Leonidas LaFayette Polk House Foundation plans to use part of the house for the Polk Museum. The rest will be used for state offices. Case Studies: North Carolina Sustainability The Leonidas L. Polk House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Polk Hall at North Carolina State University was named in his honor.

On April 26, , Mench became the 19th player in major league history to hit a home run in at least six straight games. The streak started, oddly, not too long after Mench discovered that a recurring toe injury was due to a shoe problem - he had been wearing size 12 shoes since his teenage years, but discovered his actual shoe size was 12¬Ω. On the same date, Mench set an American League record with seven consecutive multi-RBI games, a record which still stands . On April 28, Mench extended his home run streak to seven straight games, shattering his own franchise record with the Texas Rangers, and setting an all-time record for right-handed batters. The current record for most consecutive games with a home run is 8, held by Dale Long, Don Mattingly, and Ken Griffey, Jr. On July 26, 2006, Mench hit a 2-run double against the New York Yankees, the 50,000th hit in Rangers franchise history; two days later, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with Francisco Cordero, Laynce Nix, and Julian Cordero, for Carlos Lee and Nelson Cruz. Mench got his first hit with the Brewers on July 29, 2006, against the Cincinnati Reds, where he also collected an RBI. During the subsequent offseason, Mench had been repeatedly criticized by Brewers fans on radio programs for his lackluster 2006 performance with the Brewers. Mench hit only .230 with 1 home run and 18 runs batted in for the Brewers. Mench also stated he did not want to platoon in left field, taken by many fans as an excessive demand considering his performance for the Brewers so far. On January 16, , Mench and the Brewers agreed on a one-year contract for the 2007 season that would pay him $3.4 million. he was not offered a new contract by the Brewers and became a free agent on December 12, 2007. On February 12, , Mench signed a minor league deal to return to the Rangers. On May 9, , Mench was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for cash considerations. On August 25, 2008, Mench was optioned to Triple-A Syracuse by the Blue Jays, but was recalled in early September. On December 24, 2008, Mench signed a one-year deal to with the Hanshin Tigers of Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. On February 2, 2010, Mench signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals. On February 18, 2012, Mench confirmed on his Twitter account his retirement from Major League Baseball. Personal life He is married to former Chicago White Sox baseball player Scott Podsednik's sister, Shana. They have three children, twins (boy and girl) and a girl.

The short was directed by Hamilton Luske (with Wolfgang Reitherman, Les Clark, and Joshua Meador as sequence directors) and was released on June 26, 1959. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) at the 32nd Academy Awards, and became a widely viewed educational film in American schools of the 1960s. Plot =Entrance= Donald Duck, holding a hunting rifle, passes through a doorway to find that he has entered Mathmagic Land. This \\"mighty strange\\" fantasy land contains trees with square roots, a stream flowing with numbers, and a walking pencil that plays tic-tac-toe. A geometric bird recites (almost perfectly) the first 15 digits of pi. Donald soon hears the voice of the unseen \\"True Spirit of Adventure\\" (Paul Frees), who will guide him on his journey through \\"the wonderland of mathematics\\". =Pythagoras and music= Donald is initially not interested in exploring Mathmagic Land, believing that math is just for \\"eggheads\\". When \\"Mr. Spirit\\" suggests a connection between math and music, though, Donald is intrigued. First, Donald discovers the relationships between octaves and string length which develop the musical scale of today. Next, Donald finds himself in ancient Greece, where Pythagoras and his contemporaries are discovering these same relationships. Pythagoras (on the harp), a flute player, and a double bass player hold a \\"jam session\\" which Donald joins after a few moments using a vase as a bongo drum. Pythagoras' mathematical discoveries are, as the Spirit explains, the basis of today's music, and that music would not exist without \\"eggheads\\". The segment ends with a sequence of live action musicians playing both jazz and classical music and Pythagoras' pals fading away. =Pentagram, golden section, and golden rectangle= After shaking hands with Pythagoras, who then vanishes, Donald finds on his hand a pentagram, the symbol of the secret Pythagorean society. The Spirit then shows Donald how the mysterious golden section appears in the pentagram. Next, the pentagram is shown to contain the pattern for constructing golden rectangles many times over. According to the Spirit, the golden rectangle has influenced both ancient and modern cultures in many ways. =Architecture and art= Donald learns how the golden rectangle appears in many ancient buildings, such as the Parthenon and the Notre Dame cathedral. Paintings such as the Mona Lisa and various sculptures such as the Venus de Milo contain several golden rectangles. The use of the golden rectangle is found in modern architecture, such as the United Nations building in New York City. Modern painters have also rediscovered the magic of the golden rectangles. =Human body and nature= The Spirit shows Donald how the golden rectangle and pentagram are related to the human body and nature, respectively. The human body contains the \\"ideal proportions\\" of the golden section; Donald, overinterpreting the Spirit's advice, tries to make his own body fit such a proportion, but his efforts are to no avail; he ends up \\"all pent up in a pentagon\\". The pentagram and pentagon are then shown to be found in many flowers and animals, such as the petunia, the star jasmine, the starfish, the waxflower, and with the help of the inside of a nautilus shell, the Spirit explains that the magic proportions of the golden section are often found in the spirals of nature's designs, quoting Pythagoras: \\"Everything is arranged according to number and mathematical shape\\". =Games= Donald learns that mathematics applies not only to nature, architecture, and music, but also to games that are played on geometrical surfaces, including chess, baseball, football, basketball, hopscotch, and three-cushion billiards. Donald even volunteers the game Tiddlywinks, but the Spirit does not pursue this option. Themes of Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass are scattered throughout the chess scene; Carroll himself was both a writer and a mathematician. The extended billiards scene, which features a non-speaking live actor, shows the calculations involved in the game's \\"diamond system\\", and Donald finally learns how to do the calculations, spectacularly hitting ten cushions in a single shot. =Mental exercises= The Spirit then asks Donald to play a mental game, but he finds Donald's mind to be too cluttered with \\"Antiquated Ideas\\", \\"Bungling\\", \\"False Concepts\\", \\"Superstitions\\", and \\"Confusion\\". After some mental house-cleaning, Donald plays with a circle and a triangle in his mind, he spins them to make them respectively into a sphere and a cone, and then he discovers useful inventions such as the wheel, train, magnifying glass, drill, spring, propeller, and telescope. =Infinity and the future= Donald discovers that pentagrams can be drawn inside each other indefinitely. Therefore, numbers provide an avenue to consider the infinite. The Spirit states that scientific knowledge and technological advances are unlimited, and the key to unlocking the doors of the future is mathematics. By the end of the film, Donald understands and appreciates the value of mathematics. The film closes with a quote from Galileo: \\"Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe\\".

He was the elder brother of illustrators Will Dyson (1880‚Äì1938) and Ambrose Dyson (1876‚Äì1913), with three sisters also of artistic and literary praise. Dyson wrote under several ‚Äì some say many ‚Äì nom-de-plumes, including Silas Snell. In his day, the period of Australia's federation, the poet and writer was 'ranked very closely to Australia's greatest short-story writer, Henry Lawson'. With Lawson known as the 'swagman poet', Ogilvie the 'horseman poet', Dyson was the 'mining poet'. Although known as a freelance writer, he was also considered part of The Bulletin writer group. Early life He was born at Morrison's Diggings near Ballarat in March 1865. His father, George Dyson, arrived in Australia in 1852 and after working on various diggings became a mining engineer. His mother, Jane, n√©e Mayall, came from 'a life of refinement in England'.Davison, Graeme Dyson, Edward George (1865‚Äì1931) Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition, Australian National University (1981) Brother Will would marry Ruby Lindsay while Ruby's brother Lionel would marry the Dyson sister Jean. The family led a roving life during Dyson's childhood, moving successively to Alfredton, Bendigo, Ballarat and Alfredton again by the time he was eleven.(1949), at Project Gutenberg Australia He was educated at the government schools in those towns until the age of thirteen. Whereas others his age were exploring the bush, he was examining abandoned mine shafts and associated buildings. He and his child friends would also be fossicking and re-washing hillsides. At a 12-year-old he began to work as an assistant to a travelling draper (leading to the 1911 poem 'Tommy the hawker') as well as various jobs 'below and on top' in the Victorian and Tasmanian goldfields: Driving a whim horse at Ballarat, mining at Clunes and Bungaree, and panning shallow alluvial for gold at Lefroy, Tasmania, and on the Pinafore field, finding its largest nugget. His young working life also saw Dyson as a drover. Returning to Smeaton and Gordon, he was a trucker in a deep mine, then working in the battery building. About 1883 the family settled in South Melbourne, where he became a factory hand. Writing career Dyson in 1908, Melbourne At 19 years of age, Dyson began writing verse first appearing in the Ballarat Courier, and a few years later embarked on a life of freelance journalism which lasted until his death. Themes were often derived from his childhood exposures to mining, and later working in a factory. He recorded many ideas and maintained a card index, that allowed him to reflect and refine the contents of his writing and produce such volumes. He penned his first sketches, about mining, when arriving in Melbourne while working in the factory. This attracted the attention of J. F. Archibald, editor of The Bulletin. Acceptance of his writings allowed Dyson to leave the factory and earn his livelihood solely from his stories, verses, and paragraphs. His first real success came in 1889 when his short story A golden shanty was used as the title-piece in The Bulletin's Christmas anthology. His play The golden shanty was first performed in Sydney on 30 August 1913, produced by Bert Bailey.See \\"The Golden Shanty\\" (review) in The Sydney Morning Herald, 1 September 1913‚Äîat National Library of Australia The early 1890s also saw Dyson investing his savings into a weekly publication, The bull ant, produced with later-member of parliament Randolph Bedford (1868‚Äì1941) and cartoon satirist Tom Durkin (1853‚Äì1902). A later libel case from a cartoon stopped any success. The year 1893 saw Dyson side with Lawson in a poetry slam on Banjo Paterson's bush idealism, as part of the Bulletin Debate, where he submitted the poem 'The fact of the matter', which was later reworded and renamed 'The drovers in reply'. In 1896 he published his only book of verse, a volume of poems, Rhymes from the mines and other lines and, in 1898, the first collection of his short stories, Below and on top. The first book, Rhymes, was compared lesser with the recent first books of Paterson and Lawson, as his characters were not particularly Australian in identity and his broader humour. His writings today are one of the few recordings in verse of Australia's mining life (such as 'The trucker' and 'Cleaning up'). In 1901, his first long story, The gold- stealers, was published in London, which was followed by In the Roaring Fifties in 1906. In the same year appeared Fact'ry 'Ands, a series of more or less connected sketches dealing with factory life in Melbourne in a vein of humour. This comedy was made into a stage production by 1916. Dyson circa 1927Various other stories and collections of stories were published in the Bookstall Series and will be found listed in Miller's bibliography of Australian literature.E. Morris MillerAustralian Literature: a Bibliography to 1938, Extended to 1950 Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1956 Another volume of verse, Hello, Soldier!, appeared in mid-March 1919. It was to the point of publication in January 1919, a few months before Dyson's personal health significantly impacted his capability to work due to the global Spanish flu. The anthology was well received as showing 'his remarkable ability in seizing the soldier's point of view, and his dexterous use of language, plain and colored'. Dyson was influenced by The Bulletin stable of writers ‚Äì of which he also became ‚Äì included Victor Daley, Lawson, and Paterson. It was said: ::although many of his characters are sketchy, there are some notable exceptions which, by reason of their strong humanity, remain as fixed in the reader's mind as the best of Lawson's. He later contributed to the 'Bulletin' and Melbourne 'Punch' stories of factory life in Melbourne. A mixture of humour, straight farce, and not a little pathos, these were entirely different from his earlier work, and, when published later in \\"Fact'ry 'Ands,\\" \\"The Missing Link,\\" and \\"Tommy the Hawker,\\" etc., although they proved good sellers, they did little to enhance his literary reputation, which must stand or fall by virtue of his mining yarns. It was considered despite earnest work, his was a 'lesser talent' in comparison to Lawson and Paterson. Dyson also did not rank in the top twelve of the 1914 Melbourne's Herald ballot of Australia's one hundred and ten favourite poets.The 1914 Melbourne's Herald ballot ranked the top twelve of one hundred and ten favourite Australian poets as: 1st Adam Lindsay Gordon, Henry Kendall, Bernard O'Dowd, Victor Daley, Henry Lawson, Banjo Paterson, Will H. Ogilvie, James Brunton Stephens, Roderic Quinn, Mary Gilmore, George Essex Evans, E. J. Brady. (Barrier Miner newspaper, 29 July 1914, p. 6 (http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45290156)) His writing style whilst generally humorous, farcical or with exaggeration, tended to be laboured. He credited artist Louis Bradley as his mentor, and Archibald as his 'Macaenas'. Through his life Dyson's contributions included the Ballarat Courier, Tid-Bits, Life, Punch, The Bulletin, Age, Argus, Leader, Antipodean and the Cosmos. Dyson did an enormous amount of work for many years until he broke down under the strain.  Later life  In 1896 aged 31, Dyson leapt into the Yarra River to save an individual's life, indicating the physique of the former miner. In 1914 aged 49, he married twenty-two-year-old Dorothy Boyes, who was described as 'one of the beauties of Melbourne, and has attained some prominence as a composer'. Boyes had previously put one of Dyson's works to music. By 1923 Edward Dyson was feeling weakened from an appendicitis operation, which only added to his long illness resulting from the Australian 1919 influenza pandemic. His sister-in-law Ruby Lindsay, and an illustrator for his 1919 book, died during that global influenza outbreak on 12 March 1919. Dyson died, aged 66, at his home at 94 Tennyson Street, Saint Kilda, on Saturday 22 August 1931, and was cremated. His wife Dorothy survived him with their one daughter June, aged 14. With his passing it was noted: ::At present there is in the course of development a new school of writers, more polished, more in touch with world literature; but sometimes one regrets that they are not as close to the heart of their country as were the old bush story tellers.

A Democrat, Maier was a powerful but controversial figure, presiding over an era of economic and political turbulence for the city of Milwaukee.  Early life  Maier was born Henry Walter David Nelke in Dayton, Ohio. After his father died, he moved with his mother to Springfield, Ohio to live with his grandparents. He graduated from Springfield High School in 1936. When his mother moved to Milwaukee and married contractor Charles Maier, Nelke accompanied her. He changed his name to Henry Walter Maier in 1938. Maier served in the United States Navy during World War II. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's degree from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Maier was in the insurance business and taught workers' compensation and general liability insurance at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.Wisconsin Legislative Reference Library (comp.). The Wisconsin Blue Book 1960. Madison: State of Wisconsin, 1960, p. 21.  Political career  A member of the Democratic Party, Maier was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1950. In 1960 he was elected Milwaukee's mayor, succeeding Frank Zeidler, the last of Milwaukee's Socialist mayors. Maier's term included the 1967 Milwaukee riot, a response by the African- American community to a host of issues including housing discrimination and police brutality. (Maier's opposition to the Civil Rights Movement caused constant friction with his administration and Milwaukee's non-white residents). Maier remained in office for 28 years, succeeded by John Norquist in 1988. He was the longest-serving mayor in Milwaukee history. In 1993, Maier wrote a political memoir: The Mayor Who Made Milwaukee Famous. He died of pneumonia at age 76 at his home in Delafield, Wisconsin.

Unlike many major American cities that utilize number- coded limited-access roads to form belt systems, the belts in the Allegheny County Belt System are not intended to be used as high-speed routes. Rather, the belt system is to be used as a navigational aid for motorists in unfamiliar portions of the county. Roads that make up the Belt System retain their previous names. The five original routes are, from outermost to innermost, the Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, and Blue Belts. The Purple Belt was not part of the original system and was added later. History The Allegheny County Belt System was developed in the late 1940s by Joseph White, an engineer with the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, as a wayfarer system using a network of federal, state, and municipal roads to offer residents alternative traffic patterns which did not lead to downtown Pittsburgh's congested Golden Triangle. As such, it actually predates the Interstate Highway System developed during the Eisenhower administration. Yellow Belt at PA 51 From late 1951 to early 1952, the signs were posted throughout the finalized belt routes, starting with the Orange route, then Blue, Yellow, Red and Green. The belt routes were not intended as high speed or limited access roads, but instead as a well-defined road system away from the existing major arterials and their congestion. The construction of the interstate highway system and regional parkways during the late 1950s through the early 1970s initially reduced the use and need of the belt routes. As urbanization of the county spread further out from the City of Pittsburgh, however, the Belt System helped to reduce the effects of suburban congestion. Many of the roads selected over fifty years ago today play key roles in the long-range regional transportation plans of Allegheny County. Many of the roads chosen for the belts have been converted from simple country lanes to urban collector roads and to urban arterials. Segment of the Yellow Belt In its millennium edition, Pittsburgh Magazine (published by WQED television) recognized White as one of the one hundred most influential people of the 20th century in the Pittsburgh region. Rick Sebak from WQED television also produced a local feature on the Allegheny County Belt System in the 1990s. The City of Pittsburgh developed a Purple Belt for the downtown area during the mid-1990s using the county system as a guideline. A sign from the belt system is a featured Pittsburgh landmark on Yinztagram. As of 2014, Pittsburgh does not have a true beltway, although the partially completed Southern Beltway is currently under construction as a partial beltway. Opponents of a full beltway have advocated residents to using the belt system, although some have stated that the city doesn't promote it enough and wonders why signage for it is still maintained.http://www.post-gazette.com/in-the- lead-2014-stories/2014/05/13/Infrastructure-Nay-to-a-Pittsburgh- beltway/stories/201405150085 Composition Green Belt in Edgewood The Belt System consists of six beltways. The Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red Belts travel distances of , , , , , and , respectively. The Purple, Blue, and Yellow belts are complete circular routes, beginning and ending at the same points. The Orange Belt was a complete circle until of the southernmost stretch (including its entire stretch through Washington County) was decommissioned in the 1970s to keep the belt system entirely in Allegheny County. It still briefly traverses Westmoreland County in New Kensington. Prior to its acquisition by the Chevron Corporation in 1980, the Gulf Oil Corporation, with headquarters in Pittsburgh, published a map of Allegheny County prominently displaying the Belt System. Currently, Allegheny County produces maps featuring the Belt System. Descriptions of the Belts =Red Belt= The Red Belt is the outermost belt in the system. Unlike the other belts in the system, the Red Belt does not make a part of a complete loop‚Äîinstead, it runs entirely east‚Äìwest across the northernmost part of Allegheny County. The current Red Belt is long and runs through largely rural communities. Going from west to east, it begins at the intersection of PA 65 and Cross Street in Leetsdale (just south of the Allegheny‚ÄìBeaver County line) and ends at the intersection of PA 366 and East 7th Avenue in Tarentum. The Red Belt briefly enters Beaver County in two places where it crosses to the north bank of Big Sewickley Creek. Unlike other belts in the system, most of which access many state highways, the Red Belt only intersects numbered highways at its endpoints, along with US 19 in Marshall Township, PA 8 in Richland Township, and Interstate 79 just below Butler County. Much of the route is rural. The largest suburban sprawl along the route has occurred between US 19 and PA 8. Decommissioned Red Belt segments Both ends of the Red Belt originally ran outside of Allegheny County and were truncated to their current termini in 1974. As a result, it's the only belt in the system not to cross any of Allegheny County's main rivers. Western end: Began at the PA 51 end of the Ambridge-Aliquippa Bridge in Aliquippa/Beaver County, ran across the bridge (Ohio River) to 11th Street in Ambridge, right on Duss Avenue, right on 8th Street, left on PA 65 South into Allegheny County, and left on Cross Street in Leetsdale where the current Red Belt begins eastbound Eastern end: Began at the intersection of Leechburg and Freeport Roads at PA 366 in New Kensington/Westmoreland County and ran along PA 366 West, across the Tarentum Bridge (Allegheny River) into Allegheny County and continuing where the current Red Belt begins westbound =Orange Belt= The Orange Belt is longest belt in the system, running . For most of its route, it is the outermost route in the system, except for the north of the county, where the Red Belt runs. The Orange Belt was originally a complete circle until a stretch in the south from Bethel Park to Forward Township was decommissioned (See decommissioned Orange Belt segment below). The current Orange Belt runs through the northern, eastern, southern, and western sections of the county, connecting four county parks (including South Park and North Park) and the Pittsburgh International Airport. It stretches from its southwestern terminus at PA 88 in Bethel Park northwest to Moon Township and Sewickley , then northeast to Richland Township and West Deer Township, southeast to Plum and Monroeville , and finally southwest to its southeastern terminus at PA 51 in Elizabeth. Much of the route was previously rural, though suburban sprawl has placed it in many prominent commercial corridors. The Orange Belt crosses or joins many Pennsylvania routes, including the entirety of PA 48, PA 50, PA 51, PA 56, PA 88, PA 366, PA 380, PA 910, and PA 978. It also crosses or joins Interstate 376 Business, I-376, US 22 and US 30 in two areas. Of the four major rivers in Allegheny County, the Orange Belt crosses three: Ohio River via Sewickley Bridge between Sewickley and Moon Township, Allegheny River via C.L. Schmitt Bridge between New Kensington and East Deer Township, and Youghiogheny River via Boston Bridge between Versailles and Elizabeth Township. For , the Orange Belt briefly enters Westmoreland County from the C.L. Schmitt (New Kensington) Bridge to the county line on Logan's Ferry Road (formerly PA 909). Decommissioned Orange Belt segment The original Orange Belt completed a circle by crossing into Washington County, but the southernmost stretch from Bethel Park to Forward Township, including the entire Washington County segment, was removed by early 1973 to keep the Belt system within the Allegheny County border (with the exceptions of the brief stretch of this belt in Westmoreland County and two short segments of the Red Belt in Beaver County). Starting at the intersection of Library and Clifton Roads in Bethel Park where the Orange Belt currently terminates from the southwest, the former segment begins at PA 88 South through Library and Finleyville (Washington County), then continues left onto Washington Avenue / Finleyville‚ÄìElrama Road, left onto PA 837 North (back into Allegheny County), and right onto PA 51 South for to the current southeastern terminus at PA 48 North. Originally, the Orange and Yellow Belts were the only two in the system to cross all four major Allegheny County rivers. Today, only the latter carries that distinction as the former's decommissioned segment includes the crossing of the Monongahela River via Malady Bridge (PA 51) between Elizabeth and West Elizabeth. =Yellow Belt= The Yellow Belt is one of two belts, along with the Blue Belt, to make a complete loop around the city, over a distance of through the northern, eastern, southern, and western sectors of the county. For several miles in the southern part of the county, it is the outermost of the belts. The Yellow Belt stretches from its southernmost point in South Park, north and west to the border of Moon, north and east to Hampton and West Deer, and east as far as the border to Penn Hills/Plum before returning to the start. It crosses or follows PA 50, PA 51, PA 60, PA 65, PA 88, PA 121, PA 130, PA 148, PA 380, PA 791, and PA 910. It also crosses or follows US 19 and US 22. It crosses the Neville Island Bridge and the Mansfield Bridge. Yellow Belt signage near PA 88 Until 2010, when PA 60 was renumbered I-376 beginning in Robinson Township (which includes a segment of the Orange Belt), the Yellow Belt had the distinction of being the only belt in the system with a segment situated on an Interstate Highway. Starting in Neville Township at Exit 65--Neville Island, the Yellow Belt runs concurrently along I-79 for four miles northbound to Exit 68--Mount Nebo Road along the border of Sewickley Hills and Ohio Township. Curry Hollow Road composes a part of the Yellow Belt to the south of Pittsburgh. It connects with Lebanon Church Road at Pennsylvania Route 51 in Pleasant Hills, Pennsylvania, connecting Clairton Boulevard (PA 51) with Broughton Road, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 88 and Bethel Church Road. Curry Hollow was a former town along this road, where it crosses the CSX railroad tracks next to Jefferson Memorial Park. East of PA 51, the Yellow Belt becomes Lebanon Church Road and crosses Pennsylvania Route 885 in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, connecting Clairton Boulevard (PA 51) with Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. The Allegheny County Airport is on the road. Both Curry Hollow Road and Lebanon Church Road are signed as SR 3048. The Yellow Belt is also the only belt in the system to cross all four Allegheny County rivers: Ohio River via Coraopolis Bridge between Coraopolis and Neville Island, Monongahela River via Mansfield Bridge between Dravosburg and McKeesport, Youghiogheny River via Jerome Street Bridge in McKeesport and Allegheny River via Hulton Bridge between Harmar and Oakmont (The Orange Belt also had this distinction until its southernmost segment which crossed the Monongahela River was decommissioned) =Green Belt= The Green Belt forms a half-circle around the city, with a length of , through suburban communities in the northern and eastern sectors of the county. (The gap is due to geographic concerns rather than intersecting with other counties, as is the case with the Red and Orange Belts.) Green Belt on PA 837 The current Green Belt begins eastbound on Camp Horne Road at PA 65 in Emsworth and originally terminated before the Rankin Bridge in Rankin. This was later extended to its current southeastern terminus at PA 148 and the Yellow Belt in McKeesport, giving the Green Belt the distinctions of being the only one in the system to cross the same river (Monongahela) twice and terminate at another belt route. In its path around the city, the belt crosses or joins PA 8 (at its northernmost point in Hampton Township), PA 28, PA 65, PA 130, PA 148, and PA 837. It also briefly joins US 19 in Ross Township. There are three Green Belt crossings over two of Allegheny County's four rivers. From the northeast, the belt traverses the Allegheny River via the Highland Park Bridge between O'Hara Township and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Highland Park. Traveling southeast, the Green Belt runs across the Monongahela River via Rankin Bridge between Rankin and Whitaker, down PA 837 South for 5 miles and across the Monongahela again via McKeesport-Duquesne Bridge (between said towns) where it terminates. The Green Belt runs through many Pittsburgh neighborhoods. Its most notable landmark destinations include Kennywood Park in West Mifflin and the Pittsburgh Zoo in Pittsburgh's Highland Park neighborhood. =Blue Belt= The Blue Belt is the innermost belt in the original system, making a complete circle around the city. The current Blue Belt runs relatively close to skirting the border of the City of Pittsburgh on all sides, though it does make excursions into border towns such as Dormont and McKees Rocks. It generally serves urban communities in the northern, southern, and eastern sectors of the county. In its path around the city, the belt crosses or joins PA 8, PA 28, PA 51, PA 88, PA 121, and PA 837. It also briefly joins US 19. Only a small portion of the route (on PA 28) is a freeway. The Blue Belt crosses the Ohio River via McKees Rocks Bridge between McKees Rocks and the Brighton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Allegheny River via Highland Park Bridge between Sharpsburg and the Highland Park neighborhood of Pittsburgh, and Monongahela River via Homestead Grays Bridge between the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Squirrel Hill and Homestead. As of 2016, sections of the Blue Belt have been closed, marked one way, resigned and/or rerouted. Construction and traffic flow are the believed primary causes. Dual Blue/Green Belt segment Dual Blue and Green Belt signage For one mile in northeastern Pittsburgh, the Blue and Green Belts form the only concurrent segment in the system. The two belts meet (Blue northbound, Green southbound) at the northern end of the Highland Park Bridge off Exit 6 on PA 28. From there, the dual Blue/Green Belt route runs across said bridge, around the loop onto Butler Street/PA 8 South and to the intersection of Allegheny River and Washington Boulevards where the belts split up. Here, the Blue Belt continues with a right-hand turn onto Washington Boulevard/PA 8 South and the Green Belt continues straight on Allegheny River Boulevard/PA 130 East. =Purple Belt= The Purple Belt is the innermost colored belt in the system, running through downtown Pittsburgh. Unlike the other belts, it was established in 1995 in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Wayfinder System, a color-coded signage system downtown which helps tourists and locals find many of the common destinations in the city. (In the Wayfinder system, downtown destinations are colored purple. None of the other colors in that system correspond to the Belt System colors.) Thus, it uses a different style of signage than the other belts. Purple Belt sign in Pittsburgh Unlike the other belts, the Purple Belt's primary intent is not for navigation around the circumference of the city, but rather to assist in navigation downtown. It is also the only one of the belts to not leave the city at any point. Also, while signage for all of the other belts is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, the Purple Belt is maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Engineering and Construction. The belt does not cross any numbered routes. It travels in a loop on four two-way streets‚ÄîStanwix Street, Fort Duquesne Boulevard/11th Street, Grant Street and Boulevard of the Allies. (In the counter-clockwise direction, it follows Smithfield Street and 4th Avenue to bypass the left turn from Boulevard of the Allies onto Grant Street, which is prohibited at certain times.) This lies inside the area bounded by the Allegheny River, Interstate 579, Interstate 376 and Interstate 279.

Sven Einar Englund (June 17, 1916 - June 27, 1999) was a Finnish composer. Life Sven Einar Englund was born at Ljugarn in Gotland, Sweden, on June 17, 1916; he died June 27, 1999 in Visby, Sweden. He married twice: in 1941 to Meri Mirjam Gyllenb√∂gel, who died 1956 (they had one son and two daughters including the ballerina and choreographer Sorella Englund); and in 1958 he married Maynie Sir√©n, a singer, with whom he had one son. One of the most important Finnish symphonists since Jean Sibelius, Englund was a native Swedish speaker who often felt that his career was sidelined from the mainstream of Finnish music. He was 17 when he began studies at the Helsinki Conservatory (now the Sibelius Academy) in 1933. Already a considerable pianist, he continued his studies with Martti Paavola and Ernst Linko while studying composition with Bengt Carlson and Selim Palmgren. Following his graduation in 1941, Englund was conscripted into military service. During his time in the Finnish Continuation War he was wounded in his hand, which almost brought to an end his hopes of pursuing a career as a concert pianist. He would often recall the bizarre, though life- threatening incident, with a smile. Music Englund's first work for large orchestra was his First Symphony (1946), which became known as the \\"War Symphony\\". This was no apprentice piece; the use of counterpoint, dissonance and orchestration of singular clarity reveals a master at work. His Second Symphony, the \\"Blackbird Symphony\\", soon followed the first. In 1949 Englund was awarded a grant to study in the United States with Aaron Copland, and he also played jazz with Leonard Bernstein. It has been suggested that Englund's study with the American master consisted of discussions about music and composition, Copland having realised that there was little he could teach the younger man. Throughout the 1950s he produced a series of large-scale works including Sinuhe, a ballet (1953) originally for piano though later orchestrated, and Odysseus (1959), written for the Swedish dancer and choreographer Brigit Cullberg, a Cello Concerto (1954) and the First Piano Concerto (1955), as well as film scores and incidental music. His score for Erik Blomberg‚Äôs Valkoinen peura (The White Reindeer), which won a Jussi Award (the Finnish Oscar), and his score for Max Frisch‚Äôs play The Great Wall of China are particularly notable. He composed music for twenty films, as well as works for choir including the Hymnus Sepulcralis (1975). During the 1950s, with his second wife, the singer Maynie Sir√©n, he performed a cabaret act; he was music critic of the Swedish-language Hufvudstadsbladet, and he taught at the Sibelius Academy from 1958 until 1982. His Third Symphony (1971) appeared 23 years after his second and signalled his return to composition; he had written only a few works during the 1960s. There soon followed his Fourth (1976) and Fifth Symphonies (1977) and the Concerto for Twelve Cellos (1981). Englund‚Äôs Sixth Symphony (1984), subtitled Aphorisms, is in six movements for chorus and orchestra; his last symphony, the Seventh, was composed in 1988, coinciding with the onset of the heart disease that signalled a decline in health and would ultimately lead to his death. His Clarinet Concerto of 1991 was completed shortly before a stroke rendered further composition physically impossible. Later he suffered from kidney failure, which necessitated dialysis for the remainder of his life. Englund also composed chamber music, including a suite for solo cello and a sonata for cello and piano; there are also works for violin and piano, solo trombone, and solo piano. His memoirs, I Skuggan av Sibelius (In the Shadow of Sibelius), were published in 1997. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

It is the French-language counterpart of CBC Television, the broadcaster's English-language television network. Its headquarters are at Maison Radio- Canada in Montreal, which is also home to the network's flagship station, CBFT-DT. Until the 2012 closedown of the CBC / Radio-Canada rebroadcaster network, it was the only francophone network in Canada to broadcast terrestrially in all Canadian provinces. Programming This network is considered more populist than CBC Television. It does not face such intense competition from American networks. Despite this, it has trailed TVA in the ratings for most of the last 30 years, roughly as long as its English counterpart has trailed CTV. Its ratings have improved with offbeat sitcoms, and the talk show Tout le monde en parle. With this success, however, have come accusations of dumbing down. For instance, Tout le monde en parle replaced the long-running Sunday night arts series Les Beaux Dimanches.

Local and regional news also takes the T√©l√©journal name followed by the name of a city, region or province, or by the time of day (for example Le T√©l√©journal Montr√©al, Le T√©l√©journal Midi, etc.) CBVT-DT Quebec City, CBLFT-DT Toronto and CBOFT-DT Ottawa, and CBAFT-DT in the Atlantic provinces run local midday bulletins whilst all affiliates run supper-hour bulletins which run from Monday to Fridays, with the exception of CBVT-DT, CBOFT-DT and CBAFT-DT,Radio Canada which run seven days a week. =Current affairs= Investigative reporting is broadcast weekly as Enqu√™te. In 2008, the program tested the safety levels of Tasers in the wake of concerns raised after a Polish immigrant died after RCMP police officers fired a Taser in Vancouver International Airport.Radio Canada Other shows such as D√©couverte raised concerns about the safety of overhead bridges in Montreal after the collapse of a bridge in 2007. There is also weekly programming on political affairs concerning the National Assembly of Quebec and the House of Commons of Canada with Les coulisses du pouvoir (The Corridors of Power). Science and technology issues are covered in D√©couverte and agricultural and rural topics in La semaine verte. Consumer affairs are covered in L'√©picerie and Facture. =Sports= From 1952 to 2004, the network was home to weekly French-language broadcasts of ice hockey matches involving the Montreal Canadiens, called La Soir√©e du hockey. The show was discontinued when broadcast rights reverted to RDS. Viewers outside Quebec were able to continue watching games via Radio-Canada stations until 2006 when RDS became exclusive broadcasters. Radio-Canada were also the home of the Montreal Alouettes before moving also to RDS. It was also home for many years to French-language television broadcasts of the Montreal Expos. After briefly losing the rights to V and RDS as part of the CTV/Rogers consortium, CBC/Radio-Canada re-gained rights to the Olympic Games in 2014, with Radio- Canada as main French-language broadcaster. CBC's rights have since been renewed through 2024. =Entertainment= The most popular entertainment shows on the network are variety shows such as Tout le monde en parle and M pour musique, sketch shows like Les invincibles and Et Dieu cr√©a... Laflaque and dramas such as Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin, Virginie and Tout sur moi. Tout le monde en parle in particular is a long running talk show imported from the same show of the same name in France and has featured high-profile guests, such as Julie Couillard and former Action d√©mocratique du Qu√©bec leader Mario Dumont. A weekly music show called Studio 12 makes an appearance on Sundays. Although the bulk of the prime-time schedule is Quebec-produced, a few dubbed shows from the US have also aired in prime-time, such as Perdus, Beaut√©es d√©sep√©r√©es, and Ch√®re Betty. On New Year's Eve, Radio-Canada presents a live comedy special, Bye Bye, which features musical and comedy guests, performing live. =Children= * French-dubbed versions of television series, such as Arthur, The Garfield Show, Franklin and Friends (as Benjamin et ses amis), Caillou, Zigby, Monster Math Squad, Rob the Robot, Animal Mechanicals, Kate & Mim-Mim, Chirp, Jack, Sonic Boom, Super 4, Annedroids, Odd Squad, Pirates: Adventures in Art, Geronimo Stilton, and others. * The most popular children's show on Radio-Canada was Passe-Partout, which was in production for 10 years and broadcast until 1987. It was for some time a co-production with Radio-Qu√©bec. =Regional programming= Non-news regional programming is usually programmed for broadcast on weekends. It is limited to arts and culture and typically airs outside Quebec, especially in Acadia and the Western provinces. For example, Zeste broadcasts on stations in the Western provinces on Saturday early evenings, while Luc et Luc airs Sunday evenings in the Maritimes. Stations and affiliates Of Canada's three major French- language television networks, Radio-Canada was the only one that, until 2012, broadcast terrestrially in all Canadian provinces. With the exception of Atlantic Canada, where a single station serves all four provinces, the network has at least one originating station in every province. These stations serve every major market in French and English Canada, with privately owned affiliates serving smaller markets in Quebec. Unlike CBC Television affiliates, which often had several alternative programming sources, Radio- Canada affiliates are effectively constrained to carry network programming throughout the day in pattern with no preemptions. The only exceptions are for local and regional programming and commercials. In 2007, Radio-Canada announced its intention to terminate its long-time affiliation with three regional affiliates in Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivi√®res, and Saguenay. These stations were owned by Cogeco, at the time a majority owner of commercial rival TQS (now V). By the end of the year, TQS had filed for bankruptcy; as part of exiting bankruptcy, a deal was announced the following spring for Radio-Canada to directly acquire the stations. The transaction was approved by the CRTC on June 26, 2008. Only the stations in Rouyn-Noranda (CKRN-DT, which closed in 2018) and Rivi√®re-du-Loup (CKRT-DT) remained as private affiliates, rather than owned-and-operated stations. On February 27, 2009 CBC/Radio-Canada President Hubert Lacroix admitted at the Empire Club of Canada that the corporation is facing a budget shortfall and as a result some services may be forced to close down and/or stations merged or sold off, saying: > \\"La crise √©conomique nous force √† revoir toutes les facettes de nos > activit√©s.\\" > (\\"The economic crisis forced us to review all facets of our activities.\\") It is not yet clear how the announcement will affect stations owned by either CBC Television or T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada, however it is envisaged that regional news programming may be merged in the regions outside Quebec. Radio- Canada once operated an extensive network of rebroadcasters, but they were closed by 2012. Digital terrestrial television transition SRC converted its originating station transmitters to digital as part of the digital transition deadline in mandatory markets, which took place on August 31, 2011. On July 31, 2012, all of the corporation's 620 analog television transmitters were permanently shut down, leaving CBC's English and French television network with a total of 27 digital transmitters. Slogans and branding The network's logo until 2013; the \\"T√©l√©vision\\" portion was often excluded in promos, leaving only the CBC logo. The Network's first logo after the \\"ICI\\" rebrand, used from 2013-2016. For most of its history, the network was branded as Radio-Canada. In television listings such as TV Guide or TV Hebdo, where space limitations usually require television networks to be referred to by a three-letter abbreviation; while its full name was previously T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada, the network was normally coded as SRC (for Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada, the French language corporate name of the CBC as a whole). While the network experimented with using SRC as its on-air brand in the 1990s, within a few months it reverted to using \\"Radio-Canada\\" for nearly all verbal references. The experiment ended later in the decade. In 2009 Radio-Canada refreshed its branding featuring the word \\"T√©l√©vision\\" underneath the corporate logo; in promos, it features the logo, without any wording or slogans. On June 5, 2013, it was announced that as part of an overall effort to unify CBC's French- language platforms and outlets under a common name, T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada was to be renamed Ici T√©l√© on September 9, 2013‚Äîa nod to its longtime system cue dating back to the 1930s on radio, Ici Radio-Canada (This is Radio- Canada). The re-branding was panned by critics and politicians, who felt that the new brand was too confusing, and criticized the CBC's plans to downplay the historic \\"Radio-Canada\\" name as a viewer-facing brand, along with the reported $400,000 cost of the new campaign in the midst of budget cuts. In response to the criticism, Hubert Lacroix announced a compromise, where the Radio-Canada name would be added to the revised branding, resulting in Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√© as its official name. = Slogans = * 1966‚Äì1973: Regardez bien regardez Radio-Canada (Watch carefully, watch Radio-Canada) * 1973‚Äì1979: Partout pour nous, Radio-Canada est l√† (Radio-Canada is in everywhere for us) * 1979‚Äì1980: Faut voir √ßa (Must see that) * 1980‚Äì1981: Je choisis Radio-Canada (I choose Radio-Canada) * 1981‚Äì1982: Radio-Canada d'abord (Radio-Canada first) * 1982‚Äì1983: Soyez au poste * 1983‚Äì1985(?): Vous m√©ritez ce qu'il y'a de mieux (You deserve the best) * 1985 La T√©l√©vision de l'heure * 1989‚Äì1990: Pour Vous Avant Tout (Everything for you) * 1994‚Äì2006: (System cue/closedown): Le r√©seau national (The national network) * 1992‚Äìlate 2004: Ici Radio-Canada (This is Radio-Canada): This is what the announcer says during the system cue, when the network logo is displayed on-screen, but in the early-2000s, it became a promotional slogan in its own right, and by 2013, was repurposed as a brand for all Radio-Canada operations. * 2005: Vous allez voir (You are going to see/You will see). * 2006: Ici comme dans la vie (Here as in life) and Radio- Canada, source d'information (Radio-Canada, source of information) for news promos. * 2007: On l'aime d√©j√† (We already love it) * 2008: Bienvenue √† Radio- Canada * 2009: Mon monde est √† Radio-Canada (My world is on Radio-Canada) * 2013: Tout est possible (Everything is possible) * Since 2016: Pour toute la vie Ici Radio Canada t√©l√© Ombudsmen The ombudsman of Radio-Canada has been Pierre Tourangeau since July 2011.

High-definition television 125pxOn March 5, 2005, T√©l√©vision de Radio-Canada launched an HD simulcast of its Montreal station CBFT-DT. Since that time they have also launched HD simulcasts in Quebec City (CBVT-DT), Ottawa (CBOFT-DT), Toronto (CBLFT-DT) and Vancouver (CBUFT-DT). The HD feed is available through both pay television services, and through ATSC digital terrestrial television on the following channels: * Quebec City: 12 (11.1) * Montreal: 19 (2.1) * Ottawa: 22 (9.1) * Toronto: 24 (25.1) * Vancouver: 26 (26.1) On September 10, 2007, the network (as well as sister cable news network RDI) began broadcasting all programming solely in the 16:9 aspect ratio with few exceptions, and began letterboxing its widescreen feed for standard definition viewers. International coverage Certain shows such as Virginie and Le T√©l√©journal are carried on international francophone channel TV5MONDE. As with CBC Television, Ici T√©l√© stations can be viewed over-the-air in the northern United States including the border areas of eastern Maine via CBAFT-DT Moncton or CKRT-DT Rivi√®re-du- Loup; northern and central New England via CKSH-DT Sherbrooke; the border areas of New York State and Vermont via CBFT-DT Montreal, CBOFT-DT Ottawa- Gatineau or CBLFT-DT Toronto; or in northwest Washington via CBUFT-DT Vancouver.

The bulk milk cooling tank is an important piece of dairy farm equipment. It is usually made of stainless steel and used every day to store the raw milk on the farm in good condition. It must be cleaned after each milk collection. The milk cooling tank can be the property of the farmer or be rented from a dairy plant.  Bulk tank types  Different types of milk cooling tanks Raw milk producers have a choice of either open (from 150 to 3000 litres) or closed (from 1000 to 10000 litres) tanks. The cost can vary considerably, depending on manufacturing norms and whether a new or second hand tank is purchased. Milk silos (10,000 litres and plus) are suitable for the very large producer. These are designed to be installed outside and adjacent to the dairy, all controls and the milk outlet pipe being situated in the dairy. = Tank Construction = Bulk milk cooling tank description A milk cooling tank, also known as a bulk tank or milk cooler, consists of an inner and an outer tank, both made of high quality stainless steel. The space between the outer tank and the inner tank is isolated with polyurethane foam. In case of a power failure with an outside temperature of 30¬∞C, the content of the tank will warm up only 1¬∞C in 24 hours. To facilitate an adequate and rapid cooling of the entire content of a tank, every tank is equipped with at least one agitator. Stirring the milk ensures that all milk inside the tank is of the same temperature and that the milk stays homogeneous. On top of every closed milk cooling tank is a manhole of about 40 centimetres diameter. This enables thorough cleaning and inspection of the inner tank if necessary. The manhole is covered by a lid and sealed watertight with a rubber ring. Also on top are 2 or 3 small inlets. One is covered with an air-vent, the other(s) can be used to pump milk into the tank. A milk cooling tank usually stands on 4, 6, or 8 adjustable legs. The built-in tilt of the inner tank ensures that even the last drop of milk will eventually flow to the outlet. At the bottom, every milk cooling tank has a threaded outlet, usually including a valve. All tanks have a thermometer, allowing for immediate inspection of the inner temperature. Most tanks include an automatic cleaning system. Using hot and cold water, an acid and/or alkaline cleaning fluid, a pump and a spray lance will clean the inner tank, ensuring an hygienic inner environment each time the tank is emptied. Almost every tank has a control box. It manages the cooling process by use of a thermostat. The user can turn the system on and off, allow for extra and immediate stirring, start the cleaning routine, and reset the entire system in case of a failure. New and bigger milk cooling tanks are now being equipped with monitoring and alarm systems. These systems guard temperature of the milk inside the tank, check the functioning of the agitator, the cooling unit and temperature of the cleaning water. In case of malfunctioning of any of these functions, the alarm will activate. The monitoring system will also keep a record of the temperature and of all malfunctions for a given period.  Bulk tank manufacturing norms  Norms define among other criteria: insulation, milk agitation, cooling power required, variations in milk quantity measurement, calibration, ‚Ä¶ Some are more demanding than others. * ISO standard 5708 (Refrigerated bulk milk tanks), published in 1983 * European standard EN 13732 (Food processing machinery ‚Äì Bulk milk coolers on farms ‚Äì Requirements for construction, performance, suitability for use, safety and hygiene), published in 2003, updated in 2009 * Northern American sanitary standard 3A 13-11 (3-A Sanitary Standards for Farm Milk Cooling and Holding Tanks, 13-11), effective July 23, 2012 www.3-a.org  Bulk tank outlet standards  Swedish outlet (SMS 1145), German outlet (DIN 11851), English RJT (BS 4825), IDF (ISO 2853), tri- clamp (ISO 2852), Danish outlet (DS 722), .... can be found, not to mention different diameters. They vary from country to country. Non standard outlets make the milk collection process difficult, as the operator needs to adapt to each different standard/diameter. = Cooling Systems = There are two primary methods of cooling milk entering the bulk tank, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The tank capacity and type will depend on herd size, calving pattern, frequency of milk collection, required milk quality, energy and water availability and future plans for development.  Direct Expansion  A bulk tank with direct expansion cooling has pipes or pillow plates carrying refrigerant which are welded directly to the exterior of the milk chamber. A layer of insulation covers the exterior of the milk tank and the cooling lines, with an exterior metal shell over the insulation. Direct expansion cooling cannot run when the tank is empty or the inside walls of the tank would freeze. Instead, the tank is rapidly cooled as warm milk first enters the tank, and then the tank is cooled slowly just to maintain a low storage temperature. The rapid cooling during milking requires very large refrigeration compressors and condenser radiators to quickly expel heat from the milk, and is better suited for very large farming operations where three- phase electric power is available to operate the high-power cooling system.  Ice Bank  A bulk tank using an Ice Builder or Ice Bank immerses the bottom of the inner milk chamber in an open pool of water with copper tubes containing refrigerant suspended in the water. Between milkings, a small low- power cooling system slowly builds up a coating of ice around the copper tubes, and prevents icing of the pool over by continuously circulating the water in the pool. After the ice has achieved a thickness of 2-3 inches, the cooling system stops running. During milking, the milk entering the tank is primarily cooled by circulating the water in the pool around the walls of the inner milk chamber, and the melting of the ice. After the ice has melted sufficiently the cooling system restarts to assist the ice bank and restart the ice building. Ice bank bulk tanks are better suited for small family farm operations where only single-phase electric power is available, and high-power cooling systems would be either too expensive or difficult to install. = Milk pre-cooling = For energy savings and quality reasons it is advisable to pre-cool the milk before it enters the tank using a plate or a tube cooler (shell and tube heat exchanger) supplied with chilled water from the well water, the ice builder or the condensing unit. The quicker milk is cooled after leaving the cow the better. This system achieves most of the cooling before the milk enters the tank, so that chilled milk, rather than warm milk, is being added to the already cooled milk in the tank. = Cooling temperature = Generic temperature for milk storage is 3 to 4¬∞C. For raw milk cheese manufacturing, it would be advisable to keep the milk at 12¬∞C, as milk characteristics will be kept in a better state. The milk cooling tank is usually not completely filled at once. A 2 milking tank is designed to cool 50% of its capacity at once. A 4 milking tank is designed to cool 25% of its capacity at once, and a 6 milking tank is designed to cool 16.7% of its capacity at once. The cooling performance depends on the number of milking it takes to completely fill the tank, the ambient temperature and the cooling time.  Bulk tank cleaning systems  There are two primary methods of cleaning bulk tanks, via manual scrubbing or automatic washing. Both methods generally use four steps to clean the tank: * prerinsing with water to wet the surface and rinse off remaining milk residue * washing with hot soapy water * rinsing with water to remove the soap * final sanitizing rinse with an approved bulk tank sanitizer solution = Manual Scrubbing = Manual scrubbing requires the bulk tank to have large hinged covers that can be lifted open to permit easy access to the interior surfaces of the tank. It tends to be much more thorough than automatic methods since it permits the tank to be carefully inspected during the washing process. If the tank is not found to be cleaned well enough, a troublesome area can be given additional cleansing attention.  Manual Scrubbing Limitations  This job is difficult to perform for very large tanks, and becomes more difficult as the overall cross-section or diameter of the tank increases, requiring either a longer brush or a raised work platform around the tank to lift the cleaning worker to reach over the side of a tall tank. = Automatic Washing = Automatic bulk tank washing and are normally activated by the milk collection truck driver after each milk collection. The cleaning system operates similar to a consumer dishwasher and consists of one or more free-spinning high- pressure spray nozzles with tangential jets, with the spray nozzle mounted on the end of a flexible whip suspended down into the center of the interior. As the cleaning solution sprays out of the jet, the force of the expelled water causes the jet to spin around and the whip to wildly swing back and forth, spraying the cleaning solution randomly all over the interior of the tank.  Automatic Washing Limitations  Because no physical scrubbing occurs with automatic wash systems, the cleanser relies on surfactants and detergents to dissolve the fats left on the interior of the tank by the cream in the milk. However, this is not sufficient to remove milkstone buildup, and the tank may need to be washed occasionally with milkstone remover to remove this scale buildup that can harbor bacteria and contaminants. Automatic scrubbing only cleans the interior of the tank. It is not capable of cleaning the exterior of the tank, and it does not do a good job of washing around the cover seals. While it is possible to just clean the interior and call it good enough, it does not provide the maximum sanitation of manually washing down the exterior of the tank following or during the automatic wash process. Also, some components that contact the milk such as the drain valve cannot be properly cleaned automatically without disassembling the valve and retaining washer and directly scrubbing in soapy water.  Operating costs  Substantial reductions in running costs can be made when an ice builder is used in conjunction with off-peak electricity. Pre-cooling milk using a plate or a tube cooler supplied with mains or well water can also reduce costs and add to the cooling capacity of the tank. Bulk tank condenser units, which are not an integral part of the tank, should be fitted in an adjacent, suitable and well ventilated place. If at all possible, condenser units should not be fitted on a wall facing the sun. They should be installed in a way which allows them to draw in and discharge adequate quantities of air for efficient operation. Bulk tank should be easily accessible by large bulk collection tankers and positioned so that the tanker approaches can be kept clean and free from cow traffic at all times. Although tanks have been calibrated when first installed, bulk tank miscalibration is not uncommon and in some cases it can result in significant loss of income. Milk tanks calibrated on the low side, can cheat raw milk producers by up to 22 litres on each shipment. It is therefore advisable to re-calibrate a bulk tank.  Other usage of bulk tanks  Stainless steel bulk tanks are also used to heat or cool a fluid or simply to keep it isolated and warm/cold. Because of the hygienical finishing of the inner and outer side of the tanks, almost any fluid can be stored: water, fruit juices, honey, wine, beer, ink, paint, cosmetics, aromatic food- additives, bacterial cultures, cleansers, oil, or blood.

It was owned by Melinda Boucher Read and it aired a Christian radio format. It also carried news from the Mutual Broadcasting System. In an era where few women were in charge at radio stations, Read served as the general manager and CEO of the station. On March 4, 1996, KSPO moved to 106.5 FM, clearing 96.9 for KEZE to take over the frequency. KSPO is now the flagship station for the \\"American Christian Network.\\" =Easy Listening and Rock= The KEZE call sign started out in 1979 at 105.7 MHz, using the identification \\"KEZE, E-Z listening.\\" It aired beautiful music.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-227 In 1979, KEZE-FM was acquired by Kaye-Smith Enterprises.Broadcasting Yearbook 1982 page C-257 Kaye- Smith already owned Top 40 AM 790 KJRB, so the FM station flipped to a format that would also bring in young listeners, album-oriented rock. KEZE called itself \\"Rock 106 - Spokane's Best Rock.\\" In 1989, KJRB and KEZE were acquired by Apollo Broadcasting.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1992 page A-377 Under Apollo, KEZE leaned more toward active rock, with plenty of harder-edged rock acts on its playlist. Some of the core artists include Led Zeppelin, Night Ranger, The Rolling Stones, Ozzy Osbourne, and Def Leppard. With the emergence of grunge and \\"the Seattle sound\\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, KEZE adopted heavy guitar-based alternative rock, including Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Nirvana. On October 20, 1995, the station moved to adult album alternative (AAA) as KAEP, \\"105.7 the Peak\\".HighBeam =KEZE Moves to 96.9= The rock format and KEZE call letters moved to 96.9 FM on March 4, 1996.HighBeam As the public appeal of guitar-based alternative waned in the mid-'90s, KEZE attempted a \\"back to our roots\\" campaign as a classic rock station in 1996. Classic rock lasted about three years. In March 1999, KEZE flipped to an all-1980s hits format, known as \\"Star @ 96-9.\\"http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-03-26.pdfHighBeam In 2003, KEZE began adding some 1990's music. In 2004, it evolved to an Adult Top 40 format. The morning show on the station was well-known local hosts \\"The Breakfast Boys,\\" Dave Sposito and Ken Hopkins. They are now on sister station KZZU-FM. =Rhythmic Hits= On October 12, 2005, the station flipped to Rhythmic Top 40, a move that might have been spurred by rumors that another station might move into the Spokane radio market to fill the void after KYWL dropped the rhythmic format in 2004.HighBeamhttp://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-10-21.pdf Those rumors became reality in December 2005 when KQQB signed on with the same format as KEZE's, even though KEZE had an advantage over KQQB in terms of signal coverage of Spokane County. KQQB evolved into a Mainstream Top 40 direction, thus leaving KEZE as the only Rhythmic Contemporary station in the market. During this time, KEZE was known as \\"Wired 96-9\\" with the slogan \\"Blazin' Today's Hottest Music!\\" It was Spokane's home for the Portland based morning show The Playhouse. Wired was a generally successful station. However, ratings began to decline in early 2008. =Switch to Country= On November 20, 2008, KEZE began playing Christmas music.http://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?547439-Wired-96-9-in- Spokane-goes-All-Christmas This format change to Christmas music left Spokane without a Rhythmic Top 40 station. It also led to speculation that when the holidays ended, KEZE would switch to another format. The holiday music continued through Christmas Eve of that year. On Christmas Day 2008, KEZE switched to country music, branding itself as \\"Coyote Country.\\"http://www.allaccess.com/net- news/archive/story/50702/wired-96-9-goes-country This made KEZE the fourth station in the Spokane area to broadcast a country format on the FM band, along with KDRK \\"The Cat,\\" KIXZ-FM \\"KIX 96\\" and KICR \\"K102 Country.\\" Shortly after the flip, KEZE's ratings improved, despite the four-way competition. On May 15, 2009, Coyote Country added The Jay and Kevin Show in morning drive time. Jay and Kevin had previously aired on \\"The Cat\\" KDRK for 11 years. Jay and Kevin were joined by Sean \\"Slim\\" Widmer, formerly of Spokane's Sports Show, as their producer. =Adult Alternative= On January 1, 2010, KEZE's owner, Morgan Murphy, switched formats on two of its Spokane stations, KEZE and KXLY-FM. It moved the Coyote Country format to 99.9, while KXLY-FM's modestly successful AAA format took over 96.9 as \\"The River.\\" On November 12, 2010, the station flipped to all-Christmas, making it the second time in the station's history that 96.9 has switched to Christmas music. The AAA format returned after the holidays.http://www.radiodiscussions.com/showthread.php?593298-Spokane-s- River-96-9-Goes-All-Christmas-what-will-their-new-format-be But after the temporary holiday music phase, it was obvious that the Morgan Murphy/Spokane management had not found a successful formula for bringing the station decent ratings. =Return to Rhythmic= On April 20, 2011, station management announced that KEZE would return to a Rhythmic Top 40 format.\\"KEZE To Flip Formats\\" from All Access (April 20, 2011) It had already set up Facebook and Twitter accounts ahead of the switch, which revealed the station's new logo and moniker.\\"Spokane‚Äôs River Gets Hot\\" from Radioinsight (May 2, 2011) On May 4, 2011, at 3:05 p.m., \\"The River\\" signed off with \\"Tree by the River\\" by Iron and Wine. The station then launched \\"Hot 96.9\\" with \\"Roll Up\\" by Wiz Khalifa. With the return to Rhythmic Contemporary, KEZE faced another Rhythmic station, 104.5 KGZG, whose signal coverage requires a booster in Spokane (and who responded to KEZE's switch by setting up a website called \\"Not969.com\\" to direct listeners to its station.) Since its return to Rhythmic, KEZE has seen its two competitors, KGZG and KPXR-FM, leave the format in 2014: KGZG went dark on April 7, 2014, (and would later return as KNHK-FM), and KPXR dropped Top 40/CHR to return to Country on May 8, and later as Alternative KFOO-FM. With those flips, KEZE became the market's only Rhythmic Contemporary outlet.

It has a relatively broad effect against gram-positive cocci but not against enterobacteria. One of the earliest antimicrobial drugs, it was widely used in the mid-20th century but is little used today because better options now exist. The discovery and development of this first sulfonamide drug opened a new era in medicine, because it greatly widened the success of antimicrobial chemotherapy in an era when many physicians doubted its still largely untapped potential. At the time, disinfectant cleaners and topical antiseptic wound care were widely used but there were very few antimicrobial drugs to use safely inside living bodies. Antibiotic drugs derived from microbes, which we rely on heavily today, did not yet exist. Prontosil was discovered in 1932 by a research team at the Bayer Laboratories of the IG Farben conglomerate in Germany. Names The capitalized name \\"Prontosil\\" is Bayer's trade name; the nonproprietary names include sulfamidochryso√Ødine, rubiazol, prontosil rubrum, prontosil flavum, aseptil rojo, streptocide, and sulfamidochryso√Ødine hydrochloride. Because the drug predates the modern system of drug nomenclature, which ensures that nonproprietary names are well known from the inception of marketing, it was generally known among the public only by its trade name, and the trade name was the origin of some of the nonproprietary names (as also happened with \\"aspirin\\"). History This compound was first synthesized by Bayer chemists Josef Klarer and Fritz Mietzsch as part of a research program designed to find dyes that might act as antibacterial drugs in the body. The molecule was tested and in the late autumn of 1932 was found effective against some important bacterial infections in mice by Gerhard Domagk, who subsequently received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Medicine. Prontosil was the result of five years of testing involving thousands of compounds related to azo dyes. The crucial test result (in a murine model of Streptococcus pyogenes systemic infection) that preliminarily established the antibacterial efficacy of Prontosil in mice dates from late December 1931. IG Farben filed a German patent application concerning its medical utility on December 25, 1932. The synthesis of the compound had been first reported by Paul Gelmo, a chemistry student working at the University of Vienna in his 1909 thesis, although he had not realized its medical potential. The readily water-soluble sodium salt of sulfonamidochrysoidine, which gives a burgundy red solution and was trademarked Prontosil Solubile, was clinically investigated between 1932 and 1934, first at the nearby hospital at Wuppertal- Elberfeld headed by Philipp Klee, and then at the D√ºsseldorf University Hospital. The results were published in a series of articles in the February 15, 1935 issue of Germany's then pre-eminent medical scientific journal, Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift, and were initially received with some skepticism by a medical community bent on vaccination and crude immunotherapy. Leonard Colebrook introduced it as a cure for puerperal fever. As impressive clinical successes with Prontosil started to be reported from all over Europe, and especially after a widely published treatment in 1936 of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. (a son of U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt), acceptance was quick and dozens of medicinal chemistry teams set out to improve Prontosil. Eclipse and legacy In late 1935, working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in the laboratory of Dr. Ernest Fourneau, Jacques and Th√©r√®se Tr√©fou√´l, Dr. Daniel Bovet and Federico Nitti discovered that Prontosil is metabolized to sulfanilamide (para-aminobenzenesulfonamide), a much simpler, colorless molecule, reclassifying Prontosil as a prodrug. Prontalbin became the first oral version of sulfanilamide by Bayer, which had actually obtained a German patent on sulfanilamide as early as 1909, without realizing its medical potential at this time. It has been argued that IG Farben might have made its breakthrough discovery with sulfanilamide in 1932 but, recognizing that it would not be patentable as an antibacterial, had spent the next three years developing Prontosil as a new, and therefore more easily patentable, compound. However Dr. Bovet, who has received a Nobel Prize for medicine, and one of the authors of the French discovery, wrote in 1988: \\"Today, we have the proof that the chemists of Elberfeld were unaware of the properties of sulfanilamide at the time of our discovery and that it was by our communication that they were informed. To be convinced about it, it is enough to attentively examine the monthly reports of work of Mietzsch and Klarer during years 1935‚Äì1936 and especially the Log Book of Gerhard Domagk: the formula of sulphamide is consigned there ‚Äì without comment ‚Äì not before January 1936.\\" Dr. Alexander Ashley Weech (1895-1977), a pioneer pediatrician, while working at Columbia University's College of Physicians & Surgeons (in the affiliated New York Babies Hospital) treated the first patient in the United States with an antibiotic (sulfanilamide; prontosil) in 1935 which led to a new era of medicine across the Atlantic. Dr. Weech researched Domagk's work, translating the German article, and \\"was so intrigued by [the] experiments and by the three accompanying clinical articles on Prontosil that he contacted a pharmaceutical house, obtained a supply of the drug, and proceeded to treat a patient [a daughter of a colleague] who had serious streptococcal disease.\\" Dr. Perrin Long and Dr. Eleanor Bliss of Johns Hopkins University began their pioneering work later on prontosil and sulfanilamide which led to the large scale production of this new treatment saving the lives of millions with systemic bacterial infections. Sulfanilamide was cheap to produce and (due to the early date of its original composition of matter patent which made no reference to a medical use) was already off-patent when its antibacterial properties were first made public. Since the sulfanilamide moiety was also easy to link into other molecules, chemists soon gave rise to hundreds of second-generation sulfonamide drugs. As a result, Prontosil failed to make the profits in the marketplace hoped for by Bayer. Although quickly eclipsed by these newer \\"sulfa drugs\\" and, in the mid-1940s and through the 1950s by penicillin and other antibacterials that proved more effective against more types of bacteria, Prontosil remained on the market until the 1960s. Prontosil's discovery ushered in the era of antibacterial drugs and had a profound effect on pharmaceutical research, drug laws, and medical history. Sulfonamide-trimethoprim combinations (co-trimoxazole) are still used extensively against opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, urinary infections and in the treatment of burns. However, in many other situations, sulfa drugs have been replaced by beta-lactam antibacterials.

Its capital is Falmouth. It is bordered by the parishes of Saint Ann in the east, Saint James in the west, and Saint Elizabeth and Manchester in the south. Trelawny is known for producing several Olympic sprinters. History In 1770, the wealthy planters in St James and St Ann succeeded in having sections of those parishes become the parish of Trelawny as they were too far from administrative centres. Trelawny was named after Sir William Trelawny, 6th Baronet, the then Governor of Jamaica, whose prominent family had originated at the manor of Trelawny in the parish of Pelynt in Cornwall, England. The first capital was Martha Brae, located inland from Rock Bay. Trelawny is best known for its sugar estates and sugar cane mills. It had more sugar estates than any other parish, so there was need for a sea coast town to export it. Falmouth became a thriving seaport and social centre. The town had two of its own newspapers; The Falmouth Post and The Falmouth Gazette. Trelawny was also home to the largest group of Jamaican Maroons. A 1739 treaty between the Maroons and the English gave the Maroons freedom and land, which effectively put a stop to their raids on the plantations. However, a second Maroon uprising in 1795 led to about 600 Maroons being exiled to Nova Scotia, Canada, and later to Sierra Leone in Africa, in 1800. In 2007, the opening ceremony for the ICC Cricket World Cup was held in Trelawny Parish. Geography Trelawny is located at latitude 18¬∞15'N, longitude 77¬∞46'W. It has an area of 874 km¬≤, making it the fifth largest parish on the island. It has a population of 75,558 as of 2012. Most of the parish is flat, with wide plains such as Queen of Spain's Valley, above sea level, and Windsor, above sea level. Most of southern Trelawny is around above sea level. The highest point in the parish is Mount Ayr which is above sea level. The southern section of Trelawny is part of the Cockpit Country, and is uninhabitable. It is therefore a natural reserve for flora and fauna; most of Jamaica's 27 endemic bird species can be found there, along with yellow snakes, and the giant swallowtail butterfly, the largest butterfly in the western hemisphere. Most of the parish has the typical limestone features of sinkholes, caves, and underground passages. There are about 48 caves, most with phosphate gatherings. These include the Windsor Cave and Carambi Cave (known for its beauty and phosphate deposits). There are several other caves which have Taino carvings on the walls. There are also several underground conduits, with the longest running for . The main rivers are the Martha Brae, Rio Bueno, Cane and Quashie Rivers. Commerce Trelawny's sources of employment are based on agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. Rum and sugar are Trelawny's principal products. Other crops include bananas, yams, strawberries, vegetables, pimento, coffee, ginger, papaya and coconut. Though the fishing industry is declining, Trelawny still produces a large amount of fish. There are ten beaches along the coast, with more than 30 boats each, as well as 27 fish ponds. There are 25 factories in the parish. These produce sugar, rum, and apparel, among other things. Two of the eight remaining sugar factories in Jamaica are in Trelawny --Hampden Sugar Factory, and Trelawny Sugar, formerly Long Pond Sugar Factory. Notable citizens Trelawny Parish is the birthplace of several track and field athletes: Usain Bolt, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Marvin Anderson, Ricardo Chambers, Omar Brown, Michael Frater, Lerone Clarke, Dane Hyatt, Rosemarie Whyte, Michael Greene, Inez Turner, Debbie-Ann Parris, Sanya Richards, Ben Johnson and Warren Weir. The supercentenarian Violet Brown (1900‚Äì2017), who was at a time the oldest verified living person in the world, was born and resided in Trelawny. It is also the birthplace of 2008 USA Today High School Basketball Player of the Year Samardo Samuels, previously of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Other notable citizens include DJ Kamau Preston, dancehall artist Charly Black, basketballer Milo Channing, Rex Nettleford, University of Connecticut basketball player Kentan Facey, and star safety for the Green Bay Packers and Maurice Haughton, Atari Bigby.

Its capital is Montego Bay (derived from the Spanish word manteca (lard) because many wild hogs were found there, from which lard was made). Montego Bay was officially named the second city of Jamaica, behind Kingston, in 1981, although Montego Bay became a city in 1980 through an act of the Jamaican Parliament. The parish is the birthplace of the Right Excellent Samuel Sharpe (died 1833), one of Jamaica's seven National Heroes. History When the Spanish occupied Jamaica, Montego Bay was an export point for lard, which was obtained from wild hogs in the forests. In many of the early maps of Jamaica, Montego Bay was listed as \\"Bahia de Manteca\\" (Lard Bay). The parish was given the name \\"St. James\\" in honour of King James II by Sir Thomas Modyford, the island's first English Governor. At the beginning of the English rule, the parish was one of the poorest; it had no towns, few inhabitants and little commerce, except for the exported lard. However, after the treaty with the Maroons in 1739, St. James became one of the most important sugar-producing parishes. Annually, more than 150 ships arrived in Montego Bay bringing slaves and supplies, and taking sugar. Commerce developed as wealthy merchants and planters erected many elaborate town houses. In 1773, Montego Bay had the only newspaper outside of Kingston - The Cornwall Chronicle. Fire, in 1795 and again in 1811, destroyed much of Montego Bay. After being rebuilt, it was again destroyed in 1831 by a rebellion led by Sam Sharpe. This rebellion was as a result of slave owners' reluctance to free the slaves, even after England proposed an end to slavery. Sam Sharpe had advocated passive resistance but this was met by violence. As a result, a group of slaves responded in turn with and began setting fire to buildings and the surrounding plantations and cane fields. As a result of being the main planner of the rebellion, Sam Sharpe was hanged in the Montego Bay market place, which is today known as Sam Sharpe Square. After emancipation in 1834, the fortunes of the town and parish declined until the banana trade was promoted by J. E. Kerr and Co. This prompted the start of tourism in Jamaica. A Freeport was constructed in the 1960s, and later, a cruise ship terminal was opened. Montego Bay was accorded city status on 1 May 1980. The Sangster International Airport, the busiest airport in Jamaica and the Anglophone Caribbean and one of two international airports on the island, is located in Montego Bay. Geography The parish is bordered by Trelawny in the east, St. Elizabeth in the south and Hanover and Westmoreland in the west. It covers an area of 594.9 km¬≤, making it one of the smallest parishes in Jamaica. The population was 184,662 in 2012. About two-thirds of the parish consists of limestone. The Nassau Mountains, which rise from St. Elizabeth, south of the parish, extend diagonally across St. James. The range then declines to a point just south of Montego Bay. Its highest point is approximately 1524 metres above sea level. Great River, which serves as the boundary between St. James and its neighboring parishes Hanover and Westmoreland, and the Montego River, which rises in central St. James and flows north, then west to Montego Bay, are the two main rivers. The city of Montego Bay may be roughly divided into two sections: the tourist area, which occupies the northern section of the bay along the shore line, and the commercial and industrial sections, which are second only to Kingston in size and volume of trade. Commerce Today, Saint James is one of the fastest growing parishes on the island with large credits going to Montego Bay, because it is seen as an alternative to the overpopulated Kingston and Saint Andrew Corporate Area. Agricultural activities include forestry, and the production of sugar cane and other domestic crops. There are approximately 60 manufacturing establishments in the south of the parish, mainly for garment, woodwork, and food processing. There are also many industrial zones, including The Montego Free Zone, Bogue Industrial Estate and Ironshore. Tourism is the main source of employment in the parish; one in four persons are employed in tourism. The major forms of employment in tourism are: # craft vending in one of the three craft markets in the parish, Harbour Street Craft Market, Old Fort Craft Market and Success Craft Market; # tour bus operating for such companies as JUTA and JCAL tours; and, # various positions in the many hotels located in the parish. Over 500,000 tourists annually visit St. James, and this accounts for one-third of the revenue generated by tourism islandwide; Montego Bay is often called the Mecca of tourism in Jamaica.

He was also the paternal uncle of actress Lois Chiles. Eddie Chiles was born in Itasca, Texas to Harsh Edmonds Chiles and Jewell Files. After graduating from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri, he worked as an oil patch roustabout and as a merchant marine before hitchhiking to Norman, Oklahoma in 1930. In 1934, he graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a B.S. degree in Petroleum Engineering. In 1939, after working as a Sales Engineer with Reed Roller Bit Company in Houston, he founded the Western Company of North America. He started the company with two trucks and three employees. Western served the petroleum industry with technical services required in the discovery and production of oil and gas. The company grew to become a major oil services firm, primarily in acidizing, fracturing and cementing. At its peak, the Western Company had over 5,000 employees and annual worldwide revenues of over $500 million. During the 1970s, the Western Company also operated an offshore drilling company run by Mr. Chiles' brother, Clay Chiles. The company was sold to BJ Services in 1995. Chiles bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1980 and served as chairman of the club until 1989 when he sold the team to a group of investors that included the future President of the United States George W. Bush; New York stockbroker Richard Gilder (who later married Chiles' niece, Lois); Frank L. Morsani; and the Mack family. As an advocate for a smaller and less intrusive federal government, Chiles was also known for his 1970s radio commentaries. His trade-mark sign-on \\"I'm Eddie Chiles, and I'm mad as hell,\\" created an incredible demand for bumper stickers that read \\"I'm mad too, Eddie!\\" Western also featured television commercials telling viewers \\"If you don't have an oil well, get one you'll love doing business with Western!\\" Through these conservative radio commentaries, Chiles became a folk hero in the southwest section of the nation. He died in Fort Worth, Texas. Personal life Chiles was married to Fran Hafer, and had two children from a previous marriage, Jerry Edmond Chiles and Carol Ann Chiles Ballard.

Established in the 13th century, it is one of the oldest universities in the world. The university has 32,000 undergraduate students and more than 2,000 teachers. History The University of Valladolid (UVa) is a Spanish public university founded in 1241 as removal of studies at the University of Palencia, founded by Alfonso VIII of Castile, between 1208 and 1212. It is responsible for teaching higher education in seven campuses distributed through four cities of Castile and Leon: Valladolid, Palencia, Soria and Segovia. Buildings The first building of the university that is notable for its architecture is the one constructed at the end of the 15th century, after the move of the institution from the Colegiata. It consists of a four sided cloister, which opens up the hallways, and a late Gothic chapel. At the cloister one enters through a portal, also late Gothic, that opens to the Bookshop Street. At the beginning of the 18th century, this became insufficient, prompting an enlargement consisting of a quadrangular cloister with four galleries that open to hallways built at the same time. From the Plaza de Santa Mar√≠a (today the University Square), one can see the Baroque facade designed by the Carmelite Fray Pedro de la Visitaci√≥n and constructed in 1715. There are sculptural groups that represent allegories of the subjects that are taught in the building. The central section, organized into four columns of giants, is finished off by a giant ornamental comb. In 1909, and with great controversy, it was decided to destroy the old building, including the entrance hall from the 15th century that opened to Bookshop Street, in order to construct a new building following a design by the architect Teodosio Torres. The Baroque facade was kept. Torres's design featured two cloisters. A staircase was situated between both cloisters and a great vestibule opened to Bookshop Street. The facade of the university building to this street was based on a reinterpretation of the Baroque facade of Fray Pedro, with a mixture of Plateresque, Baroque and Neoclassical decorative elements. At one side of the facade was an observation tower and on the other was a new clock tower that filled the corner between the University Sq. and Bookshop St. The project experienced problems as the Baroque facade was incorporated slowly. In 1939, the building suffered a fire. To alleviate the problem of the facade's integration into Torres's building, Constantino Candeira designed a great staircase and vestibule, in the historicist style, that was accessed through the Baroque facade. The staircase is an example of the triumphalist and historicist architecture of Postwar Spain. In 1968 the building was finished with the destruction of the second cloister and the construction of a five- floor building to house students, and the destruction of Torres's building which had been built for far fewer students. In this same reform, the observation tower and the great auditorium of 1909. The facade that faces Librer√≠a was remodeled, losing the vestigial historicism of Torres. The new auditorium flanks the facade of Fray Pedro on one of its sides. The computer science department has hosted programming contests for the Association for Computing Machinery using online judging of the submitted programs. Baroque fa√ßade (1715) of the university building, now housing the Faculty of Law Culture Within the university there are cultural associations for music and theatre. The youth symphonic orchestra: the Joven Orquesta de la Universidad de Valladolid (Youth Orchestra of the University of Valladolid, JOUVa) is run by students of the university, and headquartered in the Residencia Universitaria Alfonso VIII of Valladolid. Since its founding in 1998 Francisco Lara Tejero has been the artistic musical director. The choir, the Coro de la Universidad de Valladolid (Choir of the University of Valladolid), is directed by Marcos Cast√°n and the Early Music Group El Parnasso. The theatre group is Gente de Teatro de la Uva, founded in 1984 with the name of People's Theatre of the Faculty of Medicine, that from 1998 became the official theater group of the university. Its director is Carlos Burguillo. Through the Area of Extension and Culture, the university presents cultural programs throughout the year, with special emphasis on the UniversiJazz Festival and Santa Cruz. Valladolid University supports cultural initiatives such as those developed by the Hermandad Universitaria del Santo Cristo de la Luz, which includes Christmas and Auto Passion. It assists in the concerts that are organized through each Vice President for University Association and with public and private partnerships.  Library  The university library has 14 library services : they are located in Palencia, Soria and Segovia provinces, the rest are situated in Valladolid, each of them have a director. All the services are managed by a Chief Librarian and coordinated by Central Services. The book collection is available through the Almena Catalogue and UVaDoc repository. The collection has 970,000 books, some of which are important ; for example its ancient book collection has 45,000 titles including manuscripts and incunabulum of 10th century.

They are a manifestation of gene amplification as a result of chromothripsis, during the development of tumors, which give the cells selective advantages for growth and survival. This selective advantage is as a result of double minutes frequently harboring amplified oncogenes and genes involved in drug resistance. Double minutes, like actual chromosomes, are composed of chromatin and replicate in the nucleus of the cell during cell division. Unlike typical chromosomes, they are composed of circular fragments of DNA, up to only a few million base pairs in size and contain no centromere or telomere. Further to this, they often lack key regulatory elements, allowing genes to be constitutively expressed. Recently, some research groups are re-branding double minutes as ecDNA.

Soviet era border guard reenactors from the FSB Border Guards Institute during the 2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade. Russia has a number of military academies of different specialties. This article primarily lists institutions of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation rather than those of the Soviet Armed Forces. Russian institutions called \\"academy\\" are post-graduate professional military schools for experienced, commissioned officers who have the equivalent of a bachelor's degree. Upon graduation, officers receive the equivalent of a master's degree and, if trained in military leadership are appointed as battalion commanders or higher from Lt. Colonel and up. Graduates with non-command training are appointed to various staff positions equivalent to Major or Lt. Colonel. Commissioned officers can study on the Kandidat Nauk () level, equivalent to a Ph.D. degree. This research-oriented degree is required for faculty positions in military schools and defence research institutes. Carefully selected experienced researchers in military academies hold limited-term positions as senior scholars leading to the prestigious post-doctoral Doktor Nauk () degree, which is roughly the equivalent of a habilitation at Central European universities where it is a prerequisite for full professor positions in institutions of higher learning. There also are a number of \\"officer commissioning schools\\" for various services known as Higher Military Schools or Institutes. As of 2010, a major reorganization of Russian military officer education, spanning the range from General Staff Academy to officer commissioning school, was underway. National joint-service educational institutions =Military University of the Ministry of Defense= =Military Academy of the General Staff= In 1936 Leonid Govorov founded the current General Staff Academy in Moscow. It has been the senior Russian professional school for officers in their late 1930s. The \\"best and the brightest\\" senior commissioned officers of all forces are selected to attend this most prestigious of all Soviet military academies. Students are admitted to the Academy in the ranks of lieutenant colonel, colonel, and Major General (one star). Most are colonels or newly promoted generals. Previous names include: Marshal Voroshilov Military Academy of the WPRA General Staff; General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR; General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

It is roughly the equivalent of the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas or the British Army's Staff College, Camberley. Officers in their late twenties up to thirty-two years at the rank of Captain or Major enter if they pass the competitive entry examinations. In the 1930s, higher academic courses were added to the Frunze curriculum as an advanced training program for previous graduates. Later on, this program became the basis for the \\"Voroshilov General Staff Academy\\" and the Frunze Academy refocused upon combined arms ground warfare training at the tactical level. In September 1998 the Frunze Academy and the \\"Malinovsky Academy\\" were amalgamated into the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the site of the former Frunze Academy,Scott and Scott, Russian Military Directory 2002, p.205 which since 2010 is known as Military Educational and Scientific Centre. The Military Educational and Scientific Centre has been the site of a number of Russian-Western joint military activities, including an IISS conference in February 2001, and U.S.-Russian exercises.

Nakhimov Naval School Founded in 1944 and located in St. Petersburg in an impressive baroque building adjacent to the AURORA, the Navy's oldest commissioned warship and the ship that has been credited with signaling the beginning of the October Revolution, this institution can be considered a naval preparatory school. Successful graduates from its program can directly enter the officer commissioning schools without sitting for the competitive entrance examinations. Originally, the Nakhimov Schools and their army equivalents, the Suvorov Schools, were established to provide education for the sons of officers who perished during the war. There were three Nakhimov Schools (Leningrad-1944, Tbilisi-1944, and Riga-1945) but the Tbilisi and Riga schools were closed in 1955 and 1952, respectively. Only the school in St. Petersburg continues to function until 2016, when the School was expanded to include campuses in major Russian naval base towns. =Naval Officer Commissioning Institutions= Peter the Great Naval Corps - St. Petersburg Naval Institute This is Russia's oldest naval officer commissioning school and institution of higher learning.

These lands are themselves part of of open spaces. Merrill Creek is connected to the Delaware River, about three miles away, by a tunnel. The earthen Merrill Creek Dam (National ID # NJ00864), with a height of 280 feet and a length at its crest of 1140 feet, was built in 1988 by a consortium of seven electric utilities, under mandate of the Delaware River Basin Commission. It replaces the river water lost through evaporation in the cooling of 14 power plants. The owners, known as the Merrill Creek Owners Group, are Public Service Electric and Gas, which built the reservoir for the group; Jersey Central Power and Light, Atlantic City Electric, Metropolitan Edison, Philadelphia Electric, Pennsylvania Power and Light, and Delmarva Power and Light. Merrill Creek Dam and Reservoir from the air. The reservoir draws water from the Delaware in springtime, when river flow normally is abundant, and restores it in the summer, when the flow is usually meager and ‚Äì compounding the problem ‚Äì demand for electricity for air- conditioning is high. In addition, by maintaining an ample Delaware River flow, seawater intrusion into the aquifers that provide drinking water to many South Jersey communities, including Camden, will be minimized. Construction cost $217 million and was one of the largest construction projects in the United States in 1986-87. The entire site was cleared of dense forest by huge tree-eating machines, and construction crews worked two 12-hour shifts to build a large earth dam and two dikes. Fishing at Merrill Creek Reservoir Launching facilities are provided for recreational boating, but no gasoline motors are allowed. The reservoir and surrounding parkland offer visitors an opportunity to engage in outdoor activity. Some of the abundant wildlife around the lake includes bald eagles, crows, white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and other various migratory birds. The reservoir is best known for its brown trout fishing. Other fish in the reservoir include walleye, yellow perch, small and largemouth bass, chain pickerel, crappie, catfish, sunfish, carp, rainbow trout, brook trout and lake trout. The lake is about two hundred thirty-five feet deep, making it the deepest man-made lake in New Jersey. The depth allows for lake trout to exist and other trout to exist year round. This is one of two lakes in New Jersey where lake trout exist. The other is Round Valley Reservoir in Hunterdon County. The lake's visitor center features natural history and cultural exhibits and offers environmental education programs for all age groups ranging from pre-K through adults.

The station, which operates at 920 kHz on the AM dial and has a translator at 100.7 MHz on the FM dial, offers a lineup of local and national news stories and syndicated talk shows. KXLY also share a website and news resources with sister station KXLY-TV. It is the flagship station of The Cougar Sports Radio Network, broadcast Washington State Cougar football and men's basketball games. It is also the alternate affiliate of the Seattle Mariners baseball network. KXLY is owned by Morgan Murphy Media. History KXLY, Spokane's oldest radio station, was founded as KFDC by Thomas W. Symons, Jr. and Edmund B. Craney in 1922. Symons was the owner of Radio Supply Co. in Spokane, and Craney had been his employee. Craney, a 17-year-old member of the North Central High School radio club, had a desire to give Spokane residents something to listen to on the radios for which Radio Supply Co. had been selling crystal parts. He persuaded Symons to start a station. After Craney received his broadcasting license, KFDC went on the air on October 18, 1922. The station had no permanent frequency position during its early days. As radio was considered a new frontier (the FCC wouldn't even be founded until 1934) and moderately regulated, Craney would have to search each night for a clean frequency (without interference from stations from distant towns) and broadcast from there. The station, which changed its call letters to KFPY in 1924, was housed in the Symons Building on 7 S. Howard Street in Spokane. Beginning in 1925, audience members were welcomed to view live broadcasts‚Äîusually music programs or dramas‚Äîat \\"The Golden Concert Studios of KFPY\\" on the second floor, which boasted a curtain, a stage and seating for 150. On the stage were two grand pianos and a Wurlitzer Organ. It was through these facilities that Bing Crosby, then an unknown Gonzaga University student, made his radio debut. Decades later, Crosby would partner with the station to launch KXLY-TV. Other unknowns who performed at the Golden Studios include Bob Crosby and Patrice Munsel. KFDC/KFPY changed its frequency six times between 1927 and 1941: 1100, 1220, 1390, 1340 and 890 were all home to the station at different points during the 14-year span. It wasn‚Äôt until 1941 that the station moved to its current location, 920 kHz. Craney left the station in 1927 to found KGIR in Butte, Montana, but returned to Spokane in 1945 to buy KFPY, which he rechristened KXLY in 1946. The new call letters reflected Craney‚Äôs \\"XL Network,\\" a chain of stations he also owned in Butte, Helena, Bozeman, Great Falls and Missoula‚Äîall of which had call letters beginning with \\"KXL.\\" In November 1953, Craney sold KXLY and KXLY-TV to the Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corporation, headed by Joseph Harris, Norman Eisenstein, and Richard E. Jones. Northern Pacific sold the KXLY stations (which now included KXLY-FM) in 1961 to current owners, Morgan Murphy Media. KXLY was affiliated with CBS Radio Network from 1927 until September 1998, at which point CBS moved to KGA and KXLY picked up ABC to match its television counterpart‚Äôs affiliation, which had made the switch 22 years earlier in 1976 after CBS severed ties with the TV station. On September 17, 2015, KXLY added a translator on 100.3 FM. In April 2016, the translator moved to 100.7 FM.

Its offices and studios are located in the Entercom Building at 625 Second Avenue South in downtown Minneapolis. WCCO features talk radio, news, and sports programming, with local hosts heard most hours of the day and evening. World and national news are supplied by CBS News Radio. Overnight, WCCO carries the syndicated CBS Sports Radio network. WCCO is a Class A clear-channel station. With 50,000 watts of power, and a nondirectional signal, WCCO reaches a wide area of North America at night. The transmitter is located off Coon Rapids Boulevard at Lily Street NW in Coon Rapids. History WLAG transmitter room in the Loring Park neighborhood's Oak Grove Hotel, 1920 =Early years= WCCO first signed on the air on September 4, 1922 as WLAG, known as \\"the Call of the North\\". The studios were in the Nicollet Hotel near Loring Park in Minneapolis.Yearbook 1935 page 38 The station soon had financial trouble and closed in 1924. Washburn Crosby Company, forerunner of General Mills, took over the station and switched the call sign to WCCO for the company's initials. Broadcasts resumed less than two months later on October 2, 1924, from its current transmitter site in Coon Rapids, and with studios still in the Nicollet Hotel. In 1927, WCCO was one of the original 21 stations of the NBC Red Network. It carried NBC's slate of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows, and big-band broadcasts during the \\"Golden Age of Radio\\". CBS bought WCCO from General Mills in 1932, and switched its network affiliation to the CBS Radio network. It remains a CBS affiliate. =1950s to the 1990s= In 1952, CBS sold majority control of WCCO to the Murphy and McNally families, who formed Midwest Radio and Television as a holding company for WCCO radio and its new co-owned television station, Channel 4 WCCO-TV. CBS was forced to sell off its stake in the WCCO stations in 1954 due to Federal Communications Commission ownership limits in effect at the time. CBS reacquired the WCCO stations outright in 1992 when Midwest Radio and Television merged with the network. In the 1950s, as network programming was shifting from radio to television, WCCO switched to a full-service middle-of-the-road format, including popular music, news, sports, and talk. Robert Ridder became president of WCCO in 1952. In the 1980s, the playlist shifted from middle-of-the-road music toward adult contemporary. The music was gradually phased out by the early 1990s, when the format was changed to news, talk, and sports. From 1947 to 1996, WCCO and WCCO-TV won 12 George Foster Peabody Awards, more than any other Twin Cities broadcast outlet. =Signal and transmitter= In the early days of radio, WCCO was a powerful force in the development of better and more powerful transmitters. On November 11, 1928, with the implementation of the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, WCCO changed its frequency to 810 kHz and was granted clear-channel status. It began broadcasting with 50,000 watts for the first time in September 1932. In the 1930s, two additional 300-foot towers were added to increase the range of the station's signal. WCCO constructed a new 654-foot tower in Coon Rapids in 1939. This is the same tower used today, although the broadcast frequency was changed to 830 kHz as a result of the 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement-. Due to the station's power, as well as Minnesota's landscape, WCCO boasts one of the largest coverage areas in the country. During the day, it provides at least B-grade coverage to almost all of Minnesota (as far north as Duluth and as far south as Rochester), plus large portions of Iowa and Wisconsin. Under the right conditions, it reaches into portions of North Dakota, South Dakota and Illinois. At night, the station's signal typically reaches across 28 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. Certain conditions can make the signal reach much farther. Legendary station personality Howard Viken says that he once picked up the station while he was in the military during World War II, stationed at Guadalcanal in 1943. =Severe weather coverage= WCCO has a longtime reputation of being the station to tune in for emergency information, especially severe weather and school closings in winter. Listeners would call in during severe weather events and describe what they were seeing at their locations, supplementing information from the National Weather Service. For many years, WCCO was famous for its \\"klaxon\\" alert tone for tornado warnings. WCCO is also a PEP station for the Emergency Alert System. For a series of live public-service emergency broadcasts in 1965 ‚Äì the St. Patrick's Day blizzard, the record April floods on the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, and the May 6 onslaught of 24 tornado touchdowns in the Twin Cities area ‚Äì the station earned the George Foster Peabody, DuPont, and Sigma Delta Chi awards. Longtime WCCO Radio logo File:WCCO (AM) logo.svg =FM: W9XHW to WCCO-FM to Lite-FM to BUZ'N/The Wolf= WCCO engineers were experimenting with frequency modulation by 1939, operating W9XHW at 42.3 MHz, but at just 50 watts. With only a handful of Minneapolis residents owning an FM radio, WCCO did not rush into FM broadcasting. As late as 1969, WCCO-FM was broadcasting at 2,700 watts atop the 450-foot Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis, and only for the minimum number of hours required to keep its FCC license. Meanwhile, several local FM stations had already boosted their power to 100,000 watts and were airing new formats on FM, such as beautiful music and progressive rock. Finally in 1973, WCCO-FM station moved its antenna to 1,250 feet near the top of the Shoreview, Minnesota, Twin Cities antenna farm, with a power of 100,000 watts. A full day's programming of music and a large news operation could be heard clearly for 150 miles in all directions. By the late 1970s, WCCO-FM 103 had come into its own and established an identity separate from AM 830, with a popular adult contemporary/soft rock sound. In 1983, it became WLTE 102.9 Lite-FM, an identity it kept until Christmas 2011, when it switched to a country music format as BUZ'N @ 102.9 with the new call letters KMNB. =Changes in ratings= WCCO was the top-rated station in the Twin Cities for decades until shifting demographics and a decline in listening to AM radio caused a drop in the Arbitron and Nielsen ratings. Several FM stations, including classic rock 92.5 KQRS-FM and Top 40 101.3 KDWB-FM were able to overtake it. One sign of the changing times: the well-known farm report was dropped in early 2004, reflecting the fact that many farmers began to rely more on the Internet for such information and that the number of farmers in Minnesota has drastically shrunk since the station first began broadcasting (although agriculture remains vital to the region). In August 2008, as a cosmetic change to make WCCO in sync with other CBS talk radio stations, the station changed from \\"News/Talk 8‚Ä¢3‚Ä¢0 WCCO\\" to \\"News Radio 8‚Ä¢3‚Ä¢0 WCCO.\\" On September 15, 2011, WCCO was awarded the NAB Marconi Radio Award for Large Market Station of the Year. =Sports= WCCO became the radio home of Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team starting with the 2011‚Äì2012 season, acquiring the broadcast rights from rival AM 1130 KFAN. WCCO started broadcasting University of St. Thomas football beginning in the 2011‚Äì2012 season. Games are hosted by David Lee. WCCO was the former home of University of Minnesota Golden Gophers athletics and Minnesota Wild hockey. WCCO had been the radio flagship of the Minnesota Vikings football team from 1961‚Äì69, 1976‚Äì84, 1988‚Äì90, and 1996‚Äì2000. The Minnesota Twins had been heard on WCCO since arriving in the Twin Cities in 1961, but because of a dispute between WCCO parent company CBS and XM Satellite Radio over compensation for its Major League Baseball broadcasts, CBS did not renew many of its MLB contracts. WCCO resumed broadcasting the Minnesota Twins in 2018. =Entercom ownership= On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio agreed to merge with Entercom. The sale was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust to shield the deal from taxes. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom was the surviving entity, with WCCO Radio no longer being co-owned with WCCO-TV. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th. In 2018, WCCO returned to the moniker \\"News/Talk 8‚Ä¢3‚Ä¢0 WCCO\\" with its logo reflecting the change. =Past personalities= WCCO broadcasters were known across the Midwest. Perhaps the greatest of them all was Cedric Adams, who first was heard on WCCO in 1931, and broadcast on the station until his death in 1961. Pilots flying over the Upper Midwest reported watching the lights go out all over the region each night when Adams finished his 10 pm newscast. Howard Viken, Maynard Speece, Charlie Boone and Roger Erickson, Jergen Nash, Joyce Lamont, and Randy Merriman became household names. When broadcaster Steve Cannon \\"the Iron Ranger\\" and his cast of characters arrived at WCCO from AM 1500 KSTP in 1971, he was still thought of by many as the \\"new guy\\" nearly until his retirement 26 years later. For several years, WCCO has hosted a weekly radio show with the governor of Minnesota. Former Governor Jesse Ventura had a show while in office, and successor Tim Pawlenty followed suit. Eleanor Mondale, the daughter of former Senator and Vice President Walter Mondale, started her career in radio at the station in 1989 as the entertainment reporter, but left after 8 months. She returned to Minnesota in 2006 to co-host a weekday morning show on WCCO-AM with Susie Jones. More recent WCCO personalities have included longtime Star Tribune columnist Sid Hartman, \\"Whole-Lotta Woman\\" Ruth Koscielak and Tim Russell, who had been a cast member on Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion, heard on NPR for many years.

Seating capacity is the number of people who can be seated in a specific space, in terms of both the physical space available, and limitations set by law. Seating capacity can be used in the description of anything ranging from an automobile that seats two to a stadium that seats hundreds of thousands of people. The largest sporting venue in the world, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, has a permanent seating capacity for more than 235,000 people and infield seating that raises capacity to an approximate 400,000. In transport Passenger Capacity of different Transport Modes In venues An aerial view of the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the 2018 AFL Grand Final, packed with 100,000 people Safety is a primary concern in determining the seating capacity of a venue: \\"Seating capacity, seating layouts and densities are largely dictated by legal requirements for the safe evacuation of the occupants in the event of fire\\".Fred R. Lawson, Conference, Convention, and Exhibit Facilities (1981), p. 137. The International Building Code specifies, \\"In places of assembly, the seats shall be securely fastened to the floor\\" but provides exceptions if the total number of seats is fewer than 100, if there is a substantial amount of space available between seats or if the seats are at tables.International Building Code (2006), 1025.12 Seat stability. It also delineates the number of available exits for interior balconies and galleries based on the seating capacity,International Building Code (2006), 1025.5 Interior balcony and gallery means of egress. and sets forth the number of required wheelchair spaces in a table derived from the seating capacity of the space.International Building Code (2006), 1108.2.2.1 General seating, Table 1108.2.2.1. The International Fire Code, portions of which have been adopted by many jurisdictions, is directed more towards the use of a facility than the construction. It specifies, \\"For areas having fixed seating without dividing arms, the occupant load shall not be less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length\\".International Fire Code (2006), 1004.7 Fixed seating. It also requires that every public venue submit a detailed site plan to the local fire code official, including \\"details of the means of egress, seating capacity, [and] arrangement of the seating....\\"International Fire Code (2006), 1701.4 Site Plans. Once safety considerations have been satisfied, determinations of seating capacity turn on the total size of the venue, and its purpose. For sports venues, the \\"decision on maximum seating capacity is determined by several factors. Chief among these are the primary sports program and the size of the market area\\".Joseph A. Wilkes, Robert T. Packard, Encyclopedia of Architecture: Design, Engineering & Construction, Vol. 4 (1989), p. 558. In motion picture venues, the \\"limit of seating capacity is determined by the maximal viewing distance for a given size of screen\\", with image quality for closer viewers declining as the screen is expanded to accommodate more distant viewers.Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, Vol. 26 (1936), p. 130. Seating capacity of venues also plays a role in what media they are able to provide and how they are able to provide it. In contracting to permit performers to use a theatre or other performing space, the \\"seating capacity of the performance facility must be disclosed\\".Charles Grippo, The Stage Producer's Business and Legal Guide (2002), p. 43-63. Seating capacity may influence the kind of contract to be used and the royalties to be given. The seating capacity must also be disclosed to the copyright owner in seeking a license for the copyrighted work to be performed in that venue. Venues that may be leased for private functions such as ballrooms and auditoriums generally advertise their seating capacity. Seating capacity is also an important consideration in the construction and use of sports venues such as stadiums and arenas. When entities such as the National Football League's Super Bowl Committee decide on a venue for a particular event, seating capacity, which reflects the possible number of tickets that can be sold for the event, is an important consideration. Legal capacity and total capacity Seating capacity differs from total capacity (sometimes called public capacity), which describes the total number of people who can fit in a venue or in a vehicle either sitting or standing. Where seating capacity is a legal requirement, however, as it is in movie theatres and on aircraft, the law reflects the fact that the number of people allowed in should not exceed the number who can be seated. Use of the term \\"public capacity\\" indicates that a venue is allowed to hold more people than it can actually seat. Again, the maximum total number of people can refer to either the physical space available or limitations set by law.

In 1931 he was regarded as 'one of the world's foremost black and white artists', and in 1980, 'Australia's greatest cartoonist'. Personal life Will Dyson was part of a literary family, with journalist and writer brother Edward 'Ted' Dyson (1865‚Äì1931), illustrator brother Ambrose Dyson (1876‚Äì1913), and three sisters also of artistic praise. His parents George and Jane came from England. Dyson was a boxer of some note in the 1900s. Artist Norman Lindsay was part of his social and professional circle and in 1909, Dyson, Lindsay, and Lindsay's illustrator sister Ruby, moved to London. Dyson went to work with the London Daily Herald. In 1910 he married Ruby. (Will's sister Jean later married Norman and Ruby's brother Lionel.) She died as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919. He returned to Australia in 1925, but for the 'mediocrity' of Melbourne, he then went to New York, and then returned London. Dyson died suddenly but peacefully relaxed in an armchair on 21 January 1938, aged 55 of heart failure. He was survived by their only child, daughter Betty (1911‚Äì1956), a noted artistic designer. Works Before moving from Australia to London, Dyson was a caricaturist for The Bulletin and occasionally for Melbourne's Herald newspaper, he drew with a 'cruel and biting' style. During World War I, Dyson became known for his war cartoons, with a satiric tone. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and sent to the Western Front, the 'mission was to make characteristic drawings of life in the trenches', making him Australia's first war artist. The frontline experience impacted him, changing his cartooning direction from the militarists to the 'sufferers'. Dyson later engaged in a debate with General Sir John Monash about his drawing of Diggers: ::(Monash) I think artists like Will Dyson, Norman Lindsay, and others have failed to reproduce the typical 'Digger' face. They make him a gaunt, haggard man with harshness written on every facial line. They're wrong! ::(Dyson) Some bitter things have been said about the digger, but so far nothing so bitter as Sir John Monash's statement that, in the matter of looks, the digger is \\"mostly a sweet-faced, round-faced mamma's boy.\\" English writer H. G. Wells (1866‚Äì1946) was part of his professional circle. He returned to Australia from 1925 to 1930, to the about- to-be-sold Melbourne Punch. He later was the chief cartoonist for the Daily Herald in London. \\"Peace and Future Cannon Fodder\\" =Prominence= It was shortly after his wife's death in 1919 that he drew what was to become one of the most celebrated and widely reproduced of all cartoons, entitled 'Peace and Future Cannon Fodder', and astonishing in its uncanny foresight. Published in the British Daily Herald on 13 May 1919, it showed David Lloyd George, Vittorio Orlando and Georges Clemenceau (the Prime Ministers of Britain, Italy and France respectively), together with Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, emerging after a meeting at Versailles to discuss the Peace Treaty. Clemenceau, who was identified by his nickname 'The Tiger' is saying to the others: 'Curious! I seem to hear a child weeping!'. And there, behind a pillar, is a child in tears; labelled '1940 Class'. Legacy Dyson's friend and colleague Charles Bean suggested that the Australian War Memorial should have a special Dyson gallery, so high was his respect for Dyson's work. In 2016, the Memorial held more than 270 of Dyson's works, but had none of them on display.Ross McMullin, \\"Our finest war artist is missing in action\\", The Age, 25 April 2016, p. 19 References Further reading *Vane Lindesay, 'Dyson, William Henry (Will) (1880‚Äì1938)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 8, MUP, 1981, pp 396‚Äì398.

Guns is the self-titled debut studio album by American hard rock band L.A. Guns. Recorded at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, it was produced by Jim Faraci and released on January 4, 1988 by Vertigo Records. The album is the only L.A. Guns release to feature drummer Nickey \\"Beat\\" Alexander, who was replaced by Steve Riley before it was released. \\"One More Reason\\", \\"Sex Action\\" and \\"Electric Gypsy\\" were released as the three singles from the album. Material for the debut L.A. Guns release was drawn from the band's formative years. Songwriting credits were listed for all five band members, as well as former lead vocalist Paul Black. The album also includes cover versions of two songs by members' former projects. Early demo recordings of several songs were included on Hollywood Raw: The Original Sessions, while the reunited classic lineup of the band re-recorded a number of tracks for Greatest Hits and Black Beauties. L.A. Guns was a minor domestic commercial success. The album spent 33 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, peaking at number 50 in April 1988. It was also certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1993, certifying sales in excess of 500,000 units. Media response to L.A. Guns was generally positive. Critics highlighted the album as a standout of the 1980s \\"hair metal\\" scene, praising the balance of commercial compositions and heavier tracks. Background L.A. Guns signed a recording contract with major label PolyGram in 1987, and changed its lineup significantly at the same time. Lead vocalist Paul Black was replaced with former Girl and Torm√© frontman Phil Lewis, former Faster Pussycat member Kelly Nickels joined on bass, and previous bassist Mick Cripps moved over to rhythm guitar to replace Robert Stoddard. The band commenced recording for its self- titled debut album in June. Recalling the process, Lewis reported that \\"We got the whole thing done in six weeks\\", adding that \\"we like that Sex Pistols type of edge and energy, so we decided to get in and out of the studio as quickly as possible.\\" Sessions took place at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles with producer Jim Faraci, who had most recently worked with glam metal bands Poison, Lizzy Borden and Ratt. Prior to its release, 1,500 advance copies of L.A. Guns were sent to rock clubs, music retailers and radio stations. PolyGram's Steve Kleinberg commented at the time that \\"We wanted to create a ground swell, and it seems to be working. Our preorders on the album are more than 65,000, and a number of major retailers have yet to place their orders.\\" \\"One More Reason\\", \\"Sex Action\\" and \\"Electric Gypsy\\" were released as singles, all with music videos directed by Ralph Ziman. Videos were also produced for \\"One Way Ticket\\" and \\"Cry No More\\" by Phillip Detchmendy, and for \\"Bitch Is Back\\", \\"No Mercy\\" and \\"Nothing to Lose\\" by Ziman and Katy Lynne. The album was promoted on a three-month United States concert tour starting on January 15, 1988, including dates supporting Ted Nugent and AC/DC. All five members of the band are credited for songwriting on L.A. Guns. The majority of songs were written by lead guitarist Tracii Guns with Lewis, while some feature co- writing credits for former vocalist Black. The album also features cover versions of Lewis's former band Girl's \\"Hollywood Tease\\", and Nickels's former band Sweet Pain's \\"Shoot for Thrills\\". L.A. Guns is the only studio album by the band to feature drummer Nickey \\"Beat\\" Alexander, who was replaced by Steve Riley before it was released. In 1999, the reunited \\"classic lineup\\" of the band recorded new versions of several songs for Greatest Hits and Black Beauties. \\"Sex Action\\" was also later included on the 2002 release Ultimate L.A. Guns, alongside a range of other previously released re-recordings and live tracks. Early demo recordings of several tracks were included on the album Hollywood Raw: The Original Sessions. Reception Upon its release, L.A. Guns debuted at number 138 on the US Billboard 200. It spent a total of 33 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 50 in April. In 1993, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for domestic sales in excess of 500,000 certified units. Outside of the US, the album reached number 88 on the RPM Canadian Albums Chart, number 67 on the Japanese Albums Chart, and number 73 on the UK Albums Chart. Media response to L.A. Guns was generally positive. Billboard magazine noted that the album \\"evinces a hard but often pop-conscious sound\\", predicting that L.A. Guns would prove popular with fans of groups like Bon Jovi. The review added that the songwriting on the album was \\"unspectacular\\", but concluded that \\"energy's there, and that counts in this genre\\". Cash Box magazine outlined that the band was \\"creating quite a stir at both radio and retail\\", suggesting that L.A. Guns would \\"push [the] band into the forefront of the national rock scene\\". Hit Parader called it \\"a nasty, naughty, noxious notion of what an L.A. band is all about\\". In a retrospective review of the album, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia described L.A. Guns as \\"a wildly over-the-top rock and roll album\\", praising it for \\"rock[ing] with a bile and fury not seen since M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Shout at the Devil\\". Rivadavia also highlighted the balance between \\"Shit-kicking anthems\\" such as \\"No Mercy,\\" \\"Sex Action\\" and \\"Bitch Is Back\\", and \\"more commercial but equally hot offerings\\" such as \\"Electric Gypsy\\" and \\"Down in the City\\".

Fighting intensified on 1 March 1992 and, alternating with ad hoc ceasefires, lasted throughout the spring and early summer of 1992 until a ceasefire was declared on 21 July 1992, which has held. The conflict remained unresolved, but in 2011 talks were held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) with Lithuania holding the rotating chairmanship. Background =Historical background= Before the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and the creation of the Moldavian SSR in 1940, the Bessarabian part of Moldova, i.e. the part situated to the west of the river Dniester (Nistru), was part of Romania (1918‚Äì1940). The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Germany, that led to the events of 1940, was later denounced by present-day Moldova, which declared it \\"null and void\\" in its Declaration of Independence in 1991. However, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, the territorial changes resulting from it have remained in place. Before the creation of the Moldavian SSR, today's Transnistria was part of the Ukrainian SSR, as an autonomous republic called the Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with Tiraspol as its capital (1924‚Äì1940). It represents slightly more than one tenth of Moldova's territory. =Political background= During the last years of the 1980s, the political landscape of the Soviet Union was changing due to Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, which allowed political pluralism at the regional (republican) level. In the Moldavian SSR, as in many other parts of the Soviet Union, national movements became the leading political force. As these movements exhibited increasingly nationalist sentiments and expressed intent to leave the USSR in favor of uniting with Romania, they encountered growing opposition from among the primarily Russian-speaking ethnic minorities living in the republic.Hare, Ishaq, Batt, p. 369-370. This opposition to the new trends and potential future policies was manifested in a more visible way in Transnistria, where, unlike the rest of the MSSR, ethnic Moldovans (39.9%) were outnumbered by the combined figure of Russians and Ukrainians (53.8%) as per the 1989 Census in Transnistria, largely due to higher immigration during the Soviet Era. While some believe that the combination of a distinct history (especially 1918‚Äì1940) and a fear of discrimination by Moldovans, gave rise to separatist sentiments, others believe that ethnic tensions alone fail to account for the dynamics of the conflict. According to John Mackinlay and Peter Cross, who conducted a study based on casualty reports, significant numbers of both Transnistrians and Moldovans fought together on both sides of the conflict. They suggest that the conflict is more political in nature.[John Mackinlay and Peter Cross: Regional Peacekeepers, The Paradox of Russian Peacekeeping. United Nations University Press: New York & Paris, 2003. Pages 140‚Äì141] On 31 August 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR enacted two laws. One of them made Moldovan the official language, in lieu of Russian, the de facto official language of the Soviet Union. It also mentioned a linguistic Moldo-Romanian identity. The second law stipulated the return to the Latin Romanian alphabet. Moldovan language is the term used in the former Soviet Union for a virtually identical dialect of the Romanian language during 1940‚Äì1989. On 27 April 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR adopted the traditional tricolour (blue, yellow and red) flag with the Moldavian coat of arms and later changed in 1991 the national anthem to De»ôteaptƒÉ-te, rom√¢ne!, the national anthem of Romania since 1990. Later in 1990, the words Soviet and Socialist were dropped and the name of the country was changed to \\"Republic of Moldova\\". These events, as well as the end of the Ceau»ôescu regime in neighboring Romania in December 1989 and the partial opening of the border between Romania and Moldova on 6 May 1990, led many in Transnistria and Moldova to believe that a union between Moldova and Romania was inevitable. This possibility caused fears among the Russian-speaking population that it would be excluded from most aspects of public life. From September 1989, there were strong scenes of protests in the region against the central government's ethnic policies. The protests developed into the formation of secessionist movements in Gagauzia and Transnistria, which initially sought autonomy within the Moldavian SSR, in order to retain Russian and Gagauz as official languages. As the nationalist-dominated Moldovan Supreme Soviet outlawed these initiatives, the Gagauz Republic and Transnistria declared independence from Moldova and announced their application to be reattached to the Soviet Union as independent federal republics. =Political conflict= The language laws presented a particularly volatile issue as a great proportion of the non- Moldovan population of the Moldavian SSR did not speak Moldovan (Romanian). The problem of the official language in the MSSR had become a Gordian knot, being exaggerated and, perhaps, intentionally politicized. Some described the language laws as \\"discriminatory\\" and criticized their rapid implementation. Others, on the contrary, complained the laws were not followed. On 2 September 1990, the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed; \\"Pridnestrovie\\" being the name for Transnistria in Russian. On 22 December 1990 president Gorbachev signed a decree that declared void the decisions of the Second Congress of People Deputies of Transnistria from 2 September. For two months, Moldovan authorities refrained from taking action against this proclamation. Transnistria became one of the \\"unrecognized republics\\" that appeared throughout the USSR, alongside Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno- Karabakh. These self-proclaimed states maintained close ties with each other. One of the first clashes between the Moldovan government and separatists occurred on 2 November 1990 in DubƒÉsari. Local women stormed the Court and Prosecutor's Office and stayed there for several hours. A police detachment was then dispatched to clear a roadblock placed by the city residents on the bridge over the river Dniester that effectively cut the city off from the central government. After being prevented from clearing the roadblock, policemen opened fire, with three residents of DubƒÉsari being killed and 13 were wounded, resulting in the first casualties of the conflict. In the aftermath of the failure of the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, on 27 August 1991, the Moldovan parliament adopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova. The declaration referred to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact as null and void and viewed Moldova's Independence as an act of elimination of the political and legal consequences of the above, declaring that the establishment of the Moldavian SSR on the territories of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, Hertza region and the Moldavian ASSR was made in absence of any real legal basis.Moldova's 1991 Declaration of Independence The PMR interpreted this as meaning that the 1940-merger of the two sides of the Dniester river was dissolved. Moldova, however, did not agree, as large portions of the territory occupied in 1940 by USSR remain in Ukraine, and almost immediately took steps to assert its sovereignty over the full territory of the now-former MSSR. At that time, the Republic of Moldova did not have its own army and the first attempts to create one took place in early 1992 in response to the escalating conflict. The newly independent Moldovan parliament asked the defunct government of the USSR \\"to begin negotiations with the Moldovan government in order to put an end to the illegal occupation of the Republic of Moldova and withdraw Soviet troops from Moldovan territory\\". When, on 29 August 1991, Transnistria's independence leader Igor Smirnov and three other deputies arrived in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, to meet Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk. Smirnov and Andrei Cheban were arrested by Moldova's police and immediately transported to a prison in Moldova. In protest, the women's strike committee headed by Galina Andreeva blocked the Moscow‚ÄìChi»ôinƒÉu railway line at a waypoint between Bender and Tiraspol, until the arrested were freed by the president of Moldova Mircea Snegur in an attempt to quell the spirits. In late 1991, policemen in Tiraspol and R√Æbni»õa swore allegiance to the PMR. Military strength PMR trucks on the bridge between Tiraspol and Bendery By 1992, Moldova had troops under the Ministry of the Interior. On 17 March 1992, they started recruiting troops for the newly created Ministry of Defence. By July 1992, total Moldovan troop strength has been estimated at 25,000‚Äì35,000, including called-up police officers, conscripts, reservists and volunteers, especially from the Moldavian localities near the conflict zone. In addition to Soviet weaponry inherited upon independence, Moldova also obtained arms from Romania.Arms and Ethnic Conflict, John Sislin, Frederic S. Pearson (Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), p. 99, Romania also sent military advisors and volunteers to aid Moldova during the conflict. At the same time, the Russian 14th Guards Army in Moldovan territory numbered about 14,000 professional soldiers. The PMR authorities had 9,000 militiamen trained and armed by officers of the 14th Army. The volunteers came from the Russian Federation: a number of Don, Kuban, Orenburg, Sibir and local Transnistrian Black Sea Cossacks joined in to fight alongside the separatists. Due to the irregular makeup of the forces, troop strength of the PMR is in dispute, but it is believed that during March it numbered around 12,000.–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ù–æ—Ä–∏–Ω. –ü–æ–¥ –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∞–º–∏ –¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–∏. –°. 51 Forces of the 14th Army (which had owed allegiance to the USSR, CIS and the Russian Federation in turn) stationed in Transnistria, had fought with and on behalf of the PMR forces.Vahl, Marius.

Centre for European Political Studies, October 2001.Analysis of the Transnistrian Conflict \\"Human Rights and Russian Military Involvement in the \\"Near Abroad\\"\\" Human Rights Watch December. 1993 A significant portion of the personnel of the Russian 14th Army were local conscripts and officers that had been given local residence. PMR units were able to arm themselves with weapons taken from the stores of the former 14th Army. The Russian troops chose not to oppose the PMR units who had come to help themselves from the Army's stores; on the contrary, in many cases they helped the PMR troops equip themselves by handing over weapons and by opening up the ammunition stores to them. In December 1991, the Moldovan authorities arrested Lieutenant-General Yakovlev in Ukrainian territory, accusing him of helping the PMR forces to arm themselves by using the weapons stocks of the 14th Army. At that time, General Yakovlev has been both Commander of the 14th Army and \\"Head of the National Defence and Security Department\\" of the PMR. The government of the Russian Federation interceded with the Moldovan government to obtain the release of General Yakovlev in exchange for 26 policemen detained by PMR forces at the start of the fighting in DubƒÉsari. On 5 April 1992, Vice-President Rutskoy of Russia, in a speech delivered to 5,000 people in Tiraspol, encouraged the Transnistrian people to obtain their independence. Military conflict The first fatalities in the emerging conflict took place on 2 November 1990, two months after the PMR's 2 September 1990 declaration of independence. Moldovan forces entered DubƒÉsari in order to separate Transnistria into two halves, but were stopped by the city's inhabitants, who had blocked the bridge over the Dniester, at Lunga. In an attempt to break through the roadblock, Moldovan forces then opened fire.Vlad Grecu ‚Äì \\"O viziune din focarul conflictlui de la DubƒÉsari\\", Prut International 2005, , page 30-34 (Romanian)] In the course of the confrontation, three DubƒÉsari locals, Oleg Geletiuk, Vladimir Gotkas and Valerie Mitsuls, were killed by the Moldovan forces and sixteen people wounded. A second Moldovan attempt to cross the Lunga bridge took place on 13 December 1991. As a result of the fighting, 27 PMR troops were taken prisoner and four Moldovan troops (Ghenadie Iablocikin, Gheorghe Ca»ôu, Valentin Mereniuk and Mihai ArnƒÉut) were killed,Vlad Grecu ‚Äì \\"O viziune din focarul conflictului de la DubƒÉsari\\", page 38-39 without Moldova being able to cross the bridge. After this second failed attempt, there was a lull in military activity until 2 March 1992, considered the official start date of the War of Transnistria. This day was the same day when Moldova was admitted as a member of the United Nations, i.e. received full international recognition of its August 27, 1991 declaration of independence. The armed conflict lasted until 21 July 1992, in three areas along the Dniester river. =Cocieri-DubƒÉsari area= Building still showing damage from the brief fighting in Bendery during Transnistria's war for independence from Moldova The first area of military action was on the eastern shore of the Dniester river, from north to south, the villages of Molovata NouƒÉ, Cocieri (approx 6,000 inhabitants), Corjova and the city of DubƒÉsari (approx 30,000 inhabitants), together forming a contiguous mainly inhabited area 10‚Äì12 km along the shore. The only connection to the western bank from the three villages is either a ferry, or two bridges in DubƒÉsari. On 1 March 1992 Igor Shipcenko, the PMR militia chief of DubƒÉsari, was killed by a teenager and Moldovan police were accused of the killing. Although minor, this incident was a sufficient spark for the already very tense situation to blow up and cause the conflict to escalate. In response, the Cossacks who came from Rostov-on-Don to support the PMR side stormed the police precinct in DubƒÉsari during the night. Moldovan president Mircea Snegur, afraid of starting an armed conflict, ordered the 26 policemen to surrender to the attacking Cossacks and PMR forces. They were later exchanged for Lieutenant-General Yakovlev. Moldovan policemen loyal to Chi»ôinƒÉu from the DubƒÉsari raion (district), instead of returning to work in the occupied precinct in DubƒÉsari, now a milice precinct, gathered in Cocieri. On 2 March 1992, locals from Cocieri, after hearing about the situation in DubƒÉsari, broke into the small local arms depot to arm themselves against the PMR side. Three locals (Alexandru Luchianov from Cocieri, Alexandru Gazea from Molovata and Mihai Nour from Roghi) were killed, but the military unit from Cocieri was defeated by the Moldovans. The officers and their families were forced to leave the village.V. Grecu ‚Äì \\"O viziune din focarul conflictului de la DubƒÉsari\\", page 65-68 More policemen were ferried the following days from the western bank of the Dniester. They organized a defense line around the three villages, while PMR forces retained control of DubƒÉsari. In the following weeks both PMR and Moldovan forces amassed large numbers in the area and fought a trench war, with intermittent ceasefires. =Co»ôni»õa area= A similar development occurred on March 13 in the villages of Co»ôni»õa, P√Ær√Æta, Pohrebea and Doro»õcaia. A second \\"bridge-head\\" was formed on the eastern bank, now south of DubƒÉsari. In April, Russian vice-president Alexander Rutskoy visited Transnistria and expressed the full support of Transnistrian separatists by Soviet Russia.–•—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–ª–∏–∫—Ç–∞ –≤ –ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ ‚Äì –ú–æ–ª–¥–∞–≤—Å–∫–æ–π —Ä–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–µ —Å 1988 –ø–æ 2006 –≥. ; =Bendery area= A ceasefire was in negotiation during June in the Bendery area. However, the full-scale conflict re-erupted after regular Moldovan forces entered the city of Bendery in an attempt to reestablish the authority of Moldova there. It has been reported that this action was a response to the stand-off at the police station in Bendery on 19 June 1992. On the afternoon of that day, the Moldovan police in Bendery arrested the 14th Army's Major Yermakov on suspicion of planned subversion. After his arrest, PMR guards opened fire on the police station. The Moldovan government ordered its troops to enter the city the following morning. Urban warfare ensued between the two sides in the densely populated city, causing civilian casualties. The Moldovan radio said three Soviet Russian T-64 tanks from the 14th Army, some bearing Russian flags, were destroyed when closing in on central Bendery, two of them by T-12 antitank guns, and a third by a rocket propelled grenade that set its engine on fire. A fourth tank was disabled when its tracks were struck by a rocket propelled grenade. Russian Army spokesmen said the tanks had been seized from depots by separatists. Russian sources reported \\"dozens of dead\\" in the streets. The news of the havoc in Bendery reached Tiraspol, only 11 km away, as Moldovan troops were approaching the crucial bridge over the Dniester. At this point, with the support of ROG's tanks, the Transnistrian Republican Guard and Cossack volunteers rushed to confront the Moldovan forces. Russia Vice- President Rutskoy, in a speech delivered on the main channel of the Russian television, called for all Soviet forces in Tiraspol to storm Bendery. In the course of the following days, parts of the city of Bendery, including the center, were retaken by PMR forces. On 22 June 1992, acting on news that troops from the 14th Army were ready to cross the Dniestr and move deep into Moldova, the Moldovan military ordered an airstrike to destroy the bridge between Bendery and Tiraspol. A three MiG-29 package took off from Chisinau, two of them armed with six OFAB-250 bombs each. The other aircraft was a MiG-29UB providing cover. No direct hits were achieved on the intended target, but the bridge received some blast and splinter damage from near misses. One of the bombs went astray and fell on a civilian residence, killing a number of people inside. Sources from the 14th Army claimed a second MiG-29 attack on an oil refinery at Tiraspol the following day, in which one aircraft was allegedly shot down by a SA-3 missile, but this sortie was denied by Moldovan authorities. Ceasefire and Joint Control Commission Bendery's war memorial A ceasefire agreement was signed on 21 July. This official document whose broad lines was established by the Russian side, was signed by the presidents of Russia (Boris Yeltsin) and Moldova (Mircea Snegur). The agreement provided for peacekeeping forces charged with ensuring observance of the ceasefire and security arrangements, composed of five Russian battalions, three Moldovan battalions and two PMR battalions under the orders of a joint military command structure, the Joint Control Commission (JCC). It is estimated that in total nearly one thousand people were killed in the conflict, with the number of wounded approaching 3,000. Unlike many other post-Soviet conflicts, IDP's (internally displaced persons) did not reach large numbers in the war of Transnistria. Days after the truce had been agreed upon, a military confrontation between a local self-defence unit and the Moldovan army, took place in G√Æsca (Gyska), a village with an ethnic Russian majority near Bendery. At least three villagers were killed. During the combat, civil buildings were damaged or destroyed by artillery fire. Later reports of ceasefire violations have been brought under control with no known loss of human lives. The Russian 14th Army's role in the area was crucial to the outcome of the war. The Moldovan army's position of inferiority prevented it from gaining control of Transnistria. Russia has since disbanded the 14th army and reduced troop strength in Transnistria to a corps of around 1,300 men who form part of the JCC. With the PMR's overwhelming military superiority, Moldova had little chance of achieving victory and the fighting was unpopular with the skeptical Moldovan population.William Crowther,\\"Moldova: caught between nation and empire,\\" in New States, New Politics, Ian Bremmer and Ray Taras, eds., (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 322. Human rights abuses According to a Human Rights Center ‚ÄúMemorial‚Äù report, local Bendery eyewitnesses on 19 June 1992 saw Moldovan troops in armored vehicles deliberately firing at houses, courtyards and cars with heavy machine guns. The next day, Moldovan troops allegedly shot at civilians that were hiding in houses, trying to escape the city, or helping wounded PMR guardsmen. Other local eyewitnesses testified that in the same day, unarmed men that gathered in the Bendery downtown square in request of the PMR Executive Committee, were fired at from machine guns. HRC observers were told by doctors in Bendery that as a result of heavy fire from Moldovan positions between 19‚Äì20 June, they were unable to attend the wounded. From 21‚Äì22 June, both sides engaged in intense urban street fighting, which employed the use of tanks, artillery and grenade launchers. Officers from both sides admitted that these actions led to an increase in civilian casualties. During this time period, ambulance cars were fired upon, with both sides accusing each other of the attacks. PMR sources stated that in Bandery, one doctor was killed and several wounded, while six ambulance personnel were wounded in Kaushany. In the Moldovan city of Chi»ôinƒÉu, HRC Memorial observers interviewed 12 Transnistrian prisoners of war. The prisoners stated that while being initially detained and interrogated in Kaushany, they were severely beaten with clubs and gun buttstocks by Moldovan police, as well as being threatened with firing squads. There were also reports of captured Moldovan policemen, soldiers and volunteers being beaten and tortured by PMR forces. Outside involvement =Involvement of the Russian Army= Although the Russian Army officially took the position of neutrality and non-involvement, many of its officers were sympathetic towards the fledgling Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) and some even defected in order to help the PMR side openly. ROG Parcani sapper battalion, under the orders of General Butkevich, went over to the PMR side. This battalion later destroyed the bridges at DubƒÉsari, Gura B√¢cului-B√¢cioc and Co»ôni»õa. Moldovan forces used aircraft in the village of Parcani (Parkany) and shelled the ROG station there which meant engaging not just PMR but also Russian forces. In 1991, PMR paramilitary forces conducted forays into supply depots of the 14th Army, appropriating an unknown but large amount of equipment. With the commanding officer of the 14th Army, General G. I. Yakovlev, openly supporting the newly created PMR, these forays usually met no resistance from army guards, who never faced punishment. Yakovlev eventually participated in the founding of the PMR, served in the PMR Supreme Soviet and accepted the position as the first chairman of the PMR Department of Defense on 3 December 1991, causing the Commander-in-Chief of the CIS armed forces, Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, to promptly relieve him of his rank and service in the Russian military. Anna Volkova, Leader (Tiraspol‚Äô: [s.n.], 2001), 56. Chapter 6. Yakovlev's successor, General Yuriy Netkachev has assumed a more neutral stance in the conflict. However, his attempts at mediation between Chi»ôinƒÉu and Tiraspol were largely unsuccessful and the situation escalated to an open military engagement by June 1992. On 23 June, in the wake of a coordinated offensive by Moldovan forces, Major General Alexander Lebed arrived at the 14th Army headquarters with standing orders to inspect the army, prevent the theft of armaments from its depots, stop the ongoing conflict with any means available and ensure the unimpeded evacuation of armaments and Army personnel from Moldovan and through Ukrainian territory. After briefly assessing the situation, he assumed command of the army, relieving Netkachev, and ordered his troops to enter the conflict directly. On 3 July at 03:00, a massive artillery strike from 14th Army formations stationed on left bank of the Dniester obliterated the Moldovan force concentrated in Gerbovetskii forest, near Bendery, effectively ending the military phase of the conflict.Irina F. Selivanova. \\"U.S. and Russian Policymaking With Respect to the Use of Force\\", chapter 4, Trans-Dniestria \\"–í–æ–∂–¥—å –≤ —á—É–∂–æ–π —Å—Ç–∞–µ\\" by Mikhail Bergman A quote attributed to Lebed demonstrates his support of the Transnistrian cause: \\"I am proud that we helped and armed Transnistrian guards against Moldovan fascists\\".Anatolie Muntean, Nicolae Ciubotaru ‚Äì \\"RƒÉzboiul de pe Nistru\\" (The war on Dniestr), Ager-Economistul Publishing House, Bucharest 2004, page 451 (with a photo of Lebed inspecting Transnistrian guards) However, he bore no goodwill towards the Transnistrian leadership and frequently denounced them as \\"criminals\\" and \\"bandits\\". Another quote attributed to him describes his stance as follows: \\"I told the hooligans [separatists] in Tiraspol and the fascists in Chi»ôinƒÉu ‚Äì either you stop killing each other, or else I'll shoot the whole lot of you with my tanks\\". =Involvement of Russian and Ukrainian volunteers= Volunteers from Russia and Ukraine, including Don and Kuban Cossacks fought on Transnistria's side. There is no general consensus on the number of volunteers or the military role they played in the conflict. Estimates range from as low as 200 to as high as 3000.Managing Conflict in the Former Soviet Union: Russian and American Perspectives, Alexei Arbatov, et al. eds. (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997), p. 178, During the Transnistria War, UNA- UNSO members fought alongside Transnistrian separatists against Moldovan government forces in defense of a large ethnic-Ukrainian minority in Transnistria. The incongruous motive of assisting a mostly pro-Russian region was for the \\"struggle of Slavs over Moldovan-Romanian aggression.\\" Following the war, 50 UNSO members were awarded the PMR \\"Defender of Transnistria\\" medal. According to Romanian sources, at least one inmate was released from Bendery prison to be enrolled in the Transnistrian Guard.

He was also an Archduke of Austria, Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia. Biography Rainer was a son of Emperor Leopold II and Empress Maria Luisa, and was thus a younger brother of Emperor Franz II. Although Rainer suffered from a mild form of epilepsy, this did not visibly interfere with his military career.George R. Marek, The Eagles Die. Franz Joseph, Elisabeth, and Their Austria, pp. 41‚Äì42. New York: Harper & Row, 1974. This mild form of epilepsy was also suffered by Archduke Karl and his son, Archduke Albrecht, both of whom were able military commanders. Rainer served as Viceroy of the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia from 1818 to 1848. The position made Rainer and his wife the head of the Austrian court at Milan. Rainer politics were increasingly unpopular, the Italians resented him for their lack of political freedom and for collecting revenues with so little benefit to them. Throughout the 1840s, the political situation worsened to such an extent that in 1847, Metternich resurrected his 1817 plans for an Italian chancellery by sending his right-hand man count Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont to Milan as acting Chancellor of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia to restore the Austrian rule while taking over Northern Italy's administration. But only a few months later, Ficquelmont was recalled to Vienna to assume the leadership of the Council of war as the Revolutions of 1848 started. Archduke Rainer's mistakes as well as the lack of understanding between Rainer and Feldmarschall Graf Radetzky, were blamed for the disasters of the Italian Revolution of 1848.Joan Haslip, The Crown of Mexico, pp. 22, 89, 109.

(BEF), and eventually set up a separate food division to handle the sale of its products in other markets. The company made several major acquisitions, including Owens Country Sausage in 1987, and was split in January 2017 with the sale of its restaurant division to an affiliate of Golden Gate Capital. BEF Foods remained independently owned until September 2017 when it was sold to Post Holdings.

The distribution of these products, sold under the Bob Evans and Owens Country Sausage brand names, was independent of the restaurant division. History The Bob Evans Farm in Rio Grande, Ohio, with a Bob Evans restaurant (left). Bob Evans Restaurants was founded in 1948 by Bob Evans, when he began processing and packaging sausage for his small diner located in Gallipolis, Ohio. Early operations were based out of his southeastern Ohio farm in Rio Grande. As the reputation of his sausage grew, so did the number of guests that visited his farm to buy it in bulk. Friends and family partnered together to establish Bob Evans Farms, Inc., in 1953. The increased traffic led him to build the first company restaurant at the farm in 1962 that was named \\"The Sausage Shop\\". After running into a capacity issue fulfilling large orders, Bob Evans contracted with his cousin Tim Evans of the Evans Packing Company to package Bob Evans Sausage products. Another relative, Dan Evans, served as CEO until his retirement in 2000. Lynchburg, Virginia. The company acquired Texas-based Owens Country Sausage in 1987.

Retrieved on 11-18-2009 History Eggo waffles were invented in San Jose, California, by Frank Dorsa, who developed a process by which waffles could be cooked, frozen, and packaged for consumers. In 1953, Dorsa, along with younger brothers Anthony and Sam, introduced Eggo frozen waffles to supermarkets throughout the United States. Frozen waffles do not require a waffle iron to prepare. Because of the egg flavor, customers called them \\"Eggos\\". Eventually the name became synonymous with the product and, in 1955, the Dorsa brothers officially changed the name to \\"Eggo\\". Along with frozen waffles, the Dorsa brothers also produced Eggo potato chips (and Golden Bear potato chips) and Eggo syrup. All of the products were produced at a sprawling plant and factory on Eggo Way in San Jose, CA, near the intersection of US 101 and East Julian Street. The Dorsas were very involved in local community activities and donated extensively to school and community projects. For Halloween, instead of candy, Tony Dorsa would give out bags of Eggo potato chips to trick-or-treaters. In 1968, as a means of diversification, the Kellogg Company purchased Eggo.Steinbreder,H.

He was one of the first native Italian composers to write sacred music in the Franco-Flemish polyphonic style, combining it with the indigenous harmonic idioms of the Italian peninsula. Life He was born in Florence. In 1505, around the time of his 13th birthday, he joined the choir of the church Ss. Annunziata in Florence, where his teacher was the distinguished composer to the Medici family, Bartolomeo degli Organi. Layolle eventually married his teacher's younger sister-in-law, Maddalena Arrighi.D'Accone, Grove online In 1518 he left Florence, settling in Lyon in 1521. While in Florence he also served as a music teacher to sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, who referred to him as a superb organist, musician, and composer. Layolle remained in Lyon for the rest of his life but retained a number of friends in Florence, including several men who conspired to overthrow the Medici in 1521. After the failure of the plot and the uncovering by the Medici of the perpetrators, the conspirators fled Florence, finding refuge in Lyon with Layolle, who was able to shelter them without fear of prosecution. In the subsequent trial they were all condemned in absentia, but Layolle escaped censure; the reason for this is not known, but he never did return to Florence. His duties in Lyon included playing the organ at the cathedral of Notre Dame de Confort; in addition, he composed and edited music for some of the printing organizations there. One of his close associates was Jacques Moderne, the second-best-known printer in France after Pierre Attaignant. Much of Layolle's music was published by Moderne, but much of it has since been lost. The 1540 date of Layolle's death is probable, but no death or burial records remain. A lament on his death was published in 1540, and Layolle's last compositions were also published in that year. Music While much of Layolle's music is lost, that which remains is generally progressive in style, melodic, and finely crafted. Most of his sacred music was published by Moderne, however, no copies remain of 61 motets and at least three masses. He was one of the first composers to blend the Franco-Flemish and Italian styles. Prior to the early 16th century, most polyphonic sacred music was written by northerners, and Italians focused mainly on the lighter secular forms, and some uniquely Italian forms such as the laude spirituale; however in the early 16th century native Italian composers such as Layolle, and later Costanzo Festa, began to blend the northern polyphonic style with the Italian harmonic and tonal idioms, a blending which eventually resulted in the musical style of Palestrina and Lassus. Two books of madrigals have survived, although he called them \\"canzoni\\". Some are in Italian and others in French, and more closely related to the contemporary chanson than the Italianate madrigal. At least one of the madrigals he wrote, Lasciar il velo, became hugely popular in Europe and appears in many geographically scattered sources, both as a vocal piece and in instrumental transcription.

A language activist and advocate of the Bengali language, he wrote extensively and published eight books on the subject. He played a significant role to implement Bengali in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. He wrote Jathashabdo (1974), the first thesaurus in the Bengali language. Rahman was awarded Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1984 and Ekushey Padak in 2007 by the Government of Bangladesh. He served as a Fellow of Bangla Academy, Asiatic Society of Bangladesh and Worcester College, Oxford. Education Rahman was educated in Kolkata, Dhaka, Oxford and London. He attended the University of Dhaka and was an activist in the Bengali Language Movement. Career Rahman began his career as a lecturer in history of Dhaka University in 1952. Later he joined Rajshahi University where he subsequently held the office of Dean of the Faculty of Law (1961) and of Reader in History (1962‚Äì64). He changed his profession in 1964 when he took to law and joined the Dhaka High Court Bar. In his legal career, he held the offices of Assistant Advocate General (1969), Vice President of High Court Bar Association (1972) and member of Bangladesh bar council(1972).

It was originally broadcast on April 26, 2000. The episode is based on the Dionne quintuplets and the then-recent Eli√°n Gonz√°lez affair, the case of a Cuban-born child who had been taken by federal authorities four days before the episode aired. Plot After watching Cirque Du Cheville (a \\"Cirque du Soleil\\" parody) and liking the performance of quintuplets from the show in particular, the boys hope to make a new performance artist style circus. The boys, however, think Kenny needs to learn how to sing first. Meanwhile, the Romanian contorting quintuplets from the show, along with their grandmother, try to escape from the Romanian government hoping to bring them back. The five end up at the Marsh house, asking for shelter. Meanwhile, Kenny learns to sing through opera tapes (namely \\"Con te partir√≤\\") . At the Marsh house, Grandpa Marsh and the quints' grandmother (using her own contortion skills) have sex. The next morning, a shocked Randy finds the grandmother dead (after a night with Grandpa Marsh). After telling the quints, and with some persuasion from Cartman, Stan, and Kyle (who hope to use the quints for their circus, in which their performance is to do some contortions wearing only underpants with the Quints doing their performance), Stan's parents let the quints stay with them. The boys then decide to show the quints how great America is, taking them to, among other things, a sheep-shearing contest and a shopping mall, hoping they'll stay and do their circus. Meanwhile, the Romanian government seek Janet Reno to help get the quints back. Also, seeking to get to Romania for singing training, Kenny sings the aria \\"La donna √® mobile\\" from Verdi's Rigoletto for money in order to acquire transport for him and his mother. In Romania, Kenny proves to be a sensational singer, and, after his mother realizes that the small amount of money that she brought from the US provides them with two months of food and housing due to the massive cost of living difference between Romania and the United States, the two decide to stay. Back in the US, the Marsh house is surrounded by protesters, hoping to let the quints stay. Reno dresses as the Easter Bunny and armed with a gun and an Easter Egg-shaped tear gas canister, captures the quints. Stan, Kyle and Cartman, who don't want to lose their circus, enlist the help of the protesters outside to get the quints back. A large amount of violence starts between the protesters and government soldiers, which is stopped by the quints after they tell off all the groups on their shortcomings: their father for acting like he missed them when he in fact walked out on them five years ago, the Romanian Leaders for caring nothing about them and only wanted to make America look stupid, the protesters for having nothing better to do, and the boys (whom they consider the worst of all) for their ignorance about Romanian culture, arrogant assumptions about America's superiority, and only wanting to use the girls to perform in their circus. They then get in Oprah Winfrey's limousine for an upcoming press tour. The Border Patrol raid during the Eli√°n Gonz√°lez affair is referenced in \\"Quintuplets 2000,\\" which aired within the same week the event occurred. Meanwhile, the exact opposite of the quints' situation is occurring with Kenny in Romania. With Romanians protesting outside his house to let him stay, American soldiers invade the house and Kenny is inadvertently killed by the U.S. government, who had hoped to bring him back alive. Production As explained in the FAQ section on the official website, \\"When the year 2000 was coming up, everyone and their brother had '2000' in the titles of their products and TV shows. America was obsessed with 2000, so Trey Parker put '2000' in the titles to make fun of the ubiquity of the phrase.\\"FAQ Archives ‚Äì South Park Studios Originally, the plot involved returning the quintuplets and Kenny to their respective countries, but shortly after Elian Gonzalez was taken from his Miami relatives' home the Saturday before Easter 2000, April 22, Parker and Stone quickly changed the plot so that it would look exactly like the Miami raid.

A further paper proposed using it as an authentication protocol, which was subsequently broken. Brief history Most cryptographic protocols rely on the prior establishment of secret or public keys or passwords. However, the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange protocol introduced the concept of two parties establishing a secure channel (that is, with at least some desirable security properties) without any such prior agreement. Unauthenticated Diffie‚ÄìHellman, as an anonymous key agreement protocol, has long been known to be subject to man in the middle attack. However, the dream of a \\"zipless\\" mutually authenticated secure channel remained. The Interlock Protocol was describedR. Rivest and A. Shamir. How to Expose an Eavesdropper. CACM, Vol. 27, April 1984, pp. 393-395. as a method to expose a middle-man who might try to compromise two parties that use anonymous key agreement to secure their conversation. How it works The Interlock protocol works roughly as follows: # Alice encrypts her message with Bob's key, then sends half her encrypted message to Bob. # Bob encrypts his message with Alice's key and sends half of his encrypted message to Alice. # Alice then sends the other half of her message to Bob, who sends the other half of his. The strength of the protocol lies in the fact that half of an encrypted message cannot be decrypted. Thus, if Mallory begins her attack and intercepts Bob and Alice's keys, Mallory will be unable to decrypt Alice's half-message (encrypted using her key) and re-encrypt it using Bob's key. She must wait until both halves of the message have been received to read it, and can only succeed in duping one of the parties if she composes a completely new message. The Bellovin/Merritt Attack Davies and Price proposed the use of the Interlock Protocol for authentication in a book titled _Security for Computer Networks._ D. W. Davies and W. L. Price. Security for Computer Networks. John Wiley & Sons, second ed., 1989. But an attack on this was described by Steven M. Bellovin & Michael Merritt.S. M. Bellovin and M. Merritt. An Attack on the Interlock Protocol When Used for Authentication (PDF). I.E.E.E. Transactions on Information Theory, v. 40, n. 1, January 1994, pp. 273-275. A subsequent refinement was proposed by Ellison.C. Ellison. Establishing Identity Without Certification Authorities. Proceedings of the Sixth Annual USENIX Security Symposium, San Jose, July 1996, pp. 67-76. The Bellovin/Merritt attack entails composing a fake message to send to the first party. Passwords may be sent using the Interlock Protocol between A and B as follows: A B Ea,b(Pa)<1>-------> <-------Ea,b(Pb)<1> Ea,b(Pa)<2>-------> <-------Ea,b(Pb)<2> where Ea,b(M) is message M encrypted with the key derived from the Diffie‚ÄìHellman exchange between A and B, <1>/<2> denote first and second halves, and Pa/Pb are the passwords of A and B. An attacker, Z, could send half of a bogus message‚ÄîP?--to elicit Pa from A: A Z B Ea,z(Pa)<1>------> <------Ea,z(P?)<1> Ea,z(Pa)<2>------> Ez,b(Pa)<1>------> <------Ez,b(Pb)<1> Ez,b(Pa)<2>------> <------Ez,b(Pb)<2> At this point, Z has compromised both Pa and Pb. The attack can be defeated by verifying the passwords in parts, so that when Ea,z(P?)<1> is sent, it is known to be invalid and Ea,z(Pa)<2> is never sent (suggested by Davies). However, this does not work when the passwords are hashed, since half of a hash is useless, according to Bellovin. There are also several other methods proposed in,R. H. Morris and K. Thompson, \\"Unix password security,\\" Communications of the ACM, vol. 22, p. 594, November 1979F. T. Grampp and R. H Morris, \\"Unix operating system security,\\" AT&T; Bell Laboratories Technical Journal, vol. 63 pp. 1649-1672, October 1984D. V. Klein, \\"Foiling the cracker\\": A survey of, and improvements to, password security,\\" in Proceedings of the USENIX UNIX Security Workshop, (Portland), pp. 5-14, August 1990P. Leong and C. Tham, \\"Unix password encryption considered insecure\\" in Proc. Winter USENIX Conference, (Dallas), 1000 including using a shared secret in addition to the password. The forced-latency enhancement can also prevent certain attacks. Forced-Latency Interlock Protocol A modified Interlock Protocol can require B (the server) to delay all responses for a known duration: A B Ka-------------> <-------------Kb Ea,b(Ma)<1>----> <----Ea,b(Mb)<1> (B delays response a fixed time, T) Ea,b(Ma)<2>----> <----Ea,b(Mb)<2> (delay again) <----------data Where \\"data\\" is the encrypted data that immediately follows the Interlock Protocol exchange (it could be anything), encoded using an all-or-nothing transform to prevent in-transit modification of the message. Ma<1> could contain an encrypted request and a copy of Ka. Ma<2> could contain the decryption key for Ma<1>. Mb<1> could contain an encrypted copy of Kb, and Mb<2> could contain the decryption key for Mb<1> and the response, such as OK, or NOT FOUND, and the hash digest of the data. MITM can be attempted using the attack described in the Bellovin paper (Z being the man-in-the-middle): A Z B Ka------------->Kz-------------> <---------------Kz<-----------Kb Ea,z(Ma)<1>----> <----Ea,z(Mz)<1> (delayed response) Ea,z(Ma)<2>----> Ez,b(Ma)<1>-----> <-----Ez,b(Mb)<1> (delayed response) <----Ea,z(Mz)<2> Ez,b(Ma)<2>-----> <-----Ez,b(Mb)<2> (delayed response) <------------data <----------data In this case, A receives the data approximately after 3*T, since Z has to perform the interlocking exchange with B. Hence, the attempted MITM attack can be detected and the session aborted. Of course, Z could choose to not perform the Interlock Protocol with B (opting to instead send his own Mb) but then the session would be between A and Z, not A, Z, and B: Z wouldn't be in the middle. For this reason, the interlock protocol cannot be effectively used to provide authentication, although it can ensure that no third party can modify the messages in transit without detection.

After capturing Nazareth, the leaders of the First Crusade moved there the Metropolitan see of Scythopolis, while the Greek Orthodox continued to maintain two separate dioceses. Nazareth thus became a Latin Church Metropolitan Archdiocese circa 1100. Among its suffragans were the Bishopric of Tiberias and the Abbot of Mount Tabor. Following the Muslim conquest in the Holy Land, the Archbishops of Nazareth took refuge in Barletta (Apulia, southern Italy), and moved permanently there in 1327. It began the long line of Metropolitan Archbishops of Nazareth residing in Barletta, which was called the see of Nazareth in Barletta. On June 27, 1818, with the papal bull De ulteriori of Pope Pius VII, the Archdiocese of Nazareth was suppressed. On 22 October 1828, with the Bull Multis quidem of Pope Leo XII, the title of Archbishop of Nazareth was granted to the Archbishops of Trani. By mergers, the title passed again to the restyled Archbishops of Trani-Barletta (1860) and then to the Archbishops of Trani-Barletta-Bisceglie (1986).

Chow proceeded in the same month to unveil a $233 million six-year investment plan to improve ATV's competitive edge against TVB. Chow's first year in office saw ATV's annual budget rocket to an estimated $300‚Äì350 million, just $100‚Äì150 million less than TVB. It also poached many talents from TVB, including comedy stars Lydia Shum and Eric Tsang, as well as producers, technical staff and administrators. The growing deficit sapped Chow's power as chief executive and in March 1991 she was formally dismissed and replaced by Lam Por-yen himself. Legislative Council =Colonial period= Chow first stepped into politics when she was appointed to the Urban Council in 1980. She was subsequently appointed to the Legislative Council in 1981 by Governor Murray MacLehose. She also held numerous public offices at the time, including the membership of the Law Reform Commission, the Housing Authority and the Education Commission, a well as the chairmanship of the Consumer Council. In 1991, she was appointed to the Executive Council, the top advisory board in the government, by Governor David Wilson. She resigned the following year after the arrival of the last Governor Chris Patten who wanted to reshuffle the council. Chow was also a member of the Co-operative Resources Centre (CRC) headed by Senior Member of the Legislative Council Allen Lee consisting of the appointed members who aimed to counter the rise of the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) in the legislature after their landslide victory in the first ever direct election in 1991. The CRC soon transformed into the Liberal Party to actively lobby against Chris Patten's constitutional reform proposal, which they thought would damaged the smooth transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong due to Beijing's strong opposition. In the 1995 Legislative Council election, Chow contested in the Wholesale and Retail functional constituency and won the seat against Wong Kwok-hing of the Beijing-loyalist Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB). She was later elected to the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) after the dismantling of the \\"through train\\" of the last colonial Legislative Council. =SAR period= In the first SAR Legislative Council election in 1998, Allen Lee resigned as Liberal Party chairman lost in the direct election. James Tien succeeded as chairman and Chow became party vice-chairwoman. After 1997, the Liberal Party became the partner in Tung Chee-hwa's \\"governing coalition\\" which saw Chow being appointed to the Hong Kong Tourist Association before it was transformed into the Hong Kong Tourism Board in 2001. She has also been a board member of the Hong Kong Airport Authority, honorary adviser to Against Child Abuse, and director of the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Society. As the most senior member in the Legislative Council, she was also the chairwoman of the House Committee of the Legislative Council from 2000 to 2003. From 2003 to 2008, she was also a member of the 10th National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Public opposition to the national security legislation of the Basic Law Article 23, and the historic 2003 July 1st protest against it, led to the resignation of Liberal Party chairman James Tien from the Executive Council on 6 July. Without Liberal support in the legislature, the government was short of sufficient votes to pass the bill, which it later shelved. In September 2003, Chow was appointed to the Executive Council to fill Tien's vacancy. Riding on the popularity from the 2003 crisis, Chow and Tien left their trade-based functional constituencies and ran in geographical constituencies. Chow won a seat in New Territories West with more than 50,000 votes, more than 10 per cent of the vote share, and was elected with Tien. In the 2008 Legislative Council election, she lost her re-election in the New Territories West by receiving only about 21,000 votes, ending her 27 years of service in the legislature. Chow blamed the loss of her seat on Heung Yee Kuk chairman and Liberal Party member Lau Wong-fat for canvassing for the DAB candidate Cheung Hok-ming during the elections.Ambrose Leung & Fanny Fung, \\"Heung Yee Kuk chairman quits Liberal Party\\", 12 September 2008, Page A2, South China Morning Post As a result, both Tien and Chow resigned from the party organ with Chow also resigned from the Executive Council. After Legislative Council Selina Chow and James Tien returned to the party leadership after the intra-party split between James's brother Michael Tien and Tommy Cheung over the Minimum Wage Bill which resulted Michael's departure from the party. In January 2011, Chow succeeded Tommy Cheung as the vice- chairwoman for the second time. In the 2012 Chief Executive election, the Liberals initially supported their former member and Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang but withdrew their support after Henry Tang's illegal basement controversy. However, they refused to support another Beijing-supported candidate Leung Chun-ying. Selina Chow and party chairwoman Miriam Lau defended their null vote as \\"the responsible decision\\" as they could not with all conscience vote for either Tang or Leung; their internal poll of 1,900 people showed 30 percent would cast blank votes.Siu, Phila (22 March 2012). \\"Tang or Blank\\".

She held the chairmanship for two years until she was succeeded by Felix Chung and became the party honorary chairwoman. In the 2017 Chief Executive election, she split with other party figures in the election to nominate former Financial Secretary John Tsang on the capacity as an Election Committee member for Wholesale and Retail with James Tien, Miriam Lau and Felix Chung against the former Chief Secretary for Administration, the Beijing-supported Carrie Lam.

It opened in 1903. It was located near Twyford Abbey Road, a short distance north of the current Park Royal station which replaced it in 1931. History The station was opened on 23 June 1903 by the District Railway on a new branch line to South Harrow and Metropolitan line tracks at Rayners Lane. Park Royal & Twyford Abbey was intended to serve the recently opened Royal Agricultural Society showgrounds at Park Royal; however, despite the proximity of the station (and another to the east on what is now the Central line), the showgrounds were not successful and closed after only a few years. The second part of the station's name was adopted from the nearby Twyford Abbey. The station closed permanently on 5 July 1931 to be replaced the following day by a new Park Royal station built for the extension of Piccadilly line services to South Harrow. The new station is located approximately one-third of a mile to the south to provide access from the A40 (Western Avenue), constructed in the 1920s. Nothing of the Park Royal & Twyford Abbey station remains. Unusually, whilst the site of station is on the route of the modern Piccadilly line, it was never served by Piccadilly line trains, as they did not begin to operate to South Harrow until July 1932, a year after the station closed.

Formation and ideology The VDBL formed after the Anschluss of Austria in 1938, and advocated for the integration of Liechtenstein into the Greater German Reich. The organization disseminated its ideology through its newspaper, Der Umbruch. A slogan associated with the party was Liechtenstein den Liechtensteinern! (Liechtenstein for the Liechtensteiners!). This implied a radical populism that would threaten the allegiance of the people of Liechtenstein to ruling Prince Franz Josef II. Coup attempt and party demise In March 1939, the VDBL staged an amateurish coup attempt, first trying to provoke a German intervention by burning swastikas, followed by declaring an Anschlu√ü with Germany. The leaders were almost immediately arrested and the hoped-for German invasion failed to materialise. The inability of the party to participate in the 1939 elections (after a pact between the main parties to keep the election date a secret), combined with the drastic decrease in Nazi sympathies following the outbreak of World War II led to a temporary demise of the party. However, in June 1940 it was reconstituted under the leadership of Dr. Alfons Goop. During 1941 and 1942, the party was involved in vehement anti-Semitic agitation, urging a solution to the country's presumed \\"Jewish Question\\", accusing Jewish families in Liechtenstein of spying for the Allies. By early 1943, the VDBL had become an embarrassment to Germany: its recruitment for the Waffen-SS compromised Liechtenstein's neutrality, disquieting the Swiss. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in March 1943 forced the VDBL to hold talks with the Patriotic Union (VU), in Friedrichshafen under auspices of the Waffen-SS, in order to reach a fusion of both parties, which shared an anti- Bolshevik and anti-clerical programme. Severely disappointed, Goop resigned as party leader. In the end the VU only consented to some \\"cultural cooperation\\". When Germany's war fortunes declined, in July 1943 Der Umbruch was forbidden by the authorities. In 1946, party leaders were prosecuted for the 1939 coup attempt. Goop was in 1947 condemned for high treason, to an imprisonment of thirty months.

It was first broadcast on British Hospital Radio in 1986 under the title of 'The Adventures of Leah, Duke Gemma & Friends', and featured as a cartoon strip in The West Cumberland Times and Star newspaper in 1987. A pilot story was written and recorded for BBC Radio Cumbria in 1987, but was never broadcast owing to budgeting restrictions. The series follows the fortunes of two anthropomorphic foxes by the names of Gemma and Damien Mildury as they travel around in their space freighter, The Rapscallion, searching for their parents against the backdrop of an intergalactic war between the Bitlexian Cluster and The Federal Alliance of Planets. The two foxes find asylum on the neutral planet of Zenophon where they are befriended by brother and sister Duke and Leah Rosenly - two anthropomorphic border collie dogs who live at the spaceport next to the city of Drakester. From this safe haven, Gemma and Damien set about carving themselves out a living by buying and selling just about anything they can lay their paws on, legitimately or otherwise. The two foxes' dealings inevitably land them on the wrong side of the law, where they invariably end up being chased around by Detective Inspector Spiker (a large black alsatian dog) and Detective Constable Bones (a fox with a Galvert 6 (Welsh) accent). The series was resurrected in 2004 under the name of 'The Space Gypsy Adventures' after a break of some 17 years. The programme was wholly narrated by actor John Leeson, who is better known for being the voice behind K-9, the robot dog in the BBC-TV sci-fi series Doctor Who. The original character designs were conceived by Terry Askew, although the most recent artwork connected to the serial was provided by cartoonist Mark Alexander Smith, creator of the webcomic Transmission. Another member of the creative team is Gerry Paquette, an ex-animator who worked on the 1980s Canadian TV cartoon series The Raccoons. In September 2015 John Leeson retired from the programme. In January 2016 the show was withdrawn from the Hospital radio circuit.

The Last Will was one of the more ambitious Croatian films in the 1990s. It was supposed to be the first Croatian feature film made completely in private production, without state subsidies. It was also supposed to use the charisma of Goran Vi≈°njiƒá and Dalmatia locations to promote Croatian tourism, as well as to encourage American filmmakers to use Croatian locations and film production resources in their future projects. However, the production was hampered by many financial problems, leading to all types of lawsuits. Producers also failed to bring in any major stars from Hollywood other than Angelica Bridges. Although the film finished in 1999, because of the budget constraints, it had to wait until 2001 to be released in Croatian cinemas.

The adult's elytra are green, gray or tan, with black markings, and the whole animal, including the male's horns, may reach in length. The grubs feed on decaying wood from various trees. Description A female Dynastes tityus Adults of both sexes are wide, and males are long, including a long horn (the pronotal horn) which projects forwards from the thorax of the male; a second horn (the clypeal horn) projects upwards from the head. Dynastes tityus is therefore \\"among the longest and heaviest beetles in the United States\\". The horns are used in battles between rival males competing for a mate; the size of the horn reflects the availability of food when the beetle was growing. Despite the size of the horns, Dynastes tityus is harmless to humans. The elytra are green, gray, or tan, usually with black mottling. The pattern of spots is unique to each individual. Beetles that are found in the soil or in rotten wood often appear very dark, with the spots on the elytra obscured. This results from moisture which the shell has absorbed; when the elytra dry out, they return to their paler color. Occasionally, both elytra may be a uniform mahogany color, or one elytron may be pale with dark blotches, while the other is a plain mahogany color. Dynastes tityus was featured on a stamp issued by the United States Postal Service in October 1999. Distribution D. tityus lives in the eastern and southeastern United States, from New York state, Illinois and Indiana, south to Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, with eastern Texas marking the western limit of its range. Similar species Three of the 6 species of Dynastes found in the New World occur in the United States or Mexico. While D. tityus is found in the eastern United States, Dynastes granti (the western Hercules beetle) occurs at higher elevations in Arizona and Utah, and Dynastes hyllus is found as far north as Tamaulipas, Mexico. D. tityus and D. granti are very similar, and it is possible to mate them and produce viable hybrids. Ecology and life cycle Mating can last up to 50 minutes in D. tityus. Subsequent batches of eggs are oviposited in the same site until its resources are exhausted. The larvae are large C-shaped grubs with white bodies and chewing mouthparts, which feed on decaying wood and litter within rotten trees and produce distinctive rectangular fecal pellets about long. After 12‚Äì18 months, the larvae pupate in late summer. Adults remain underground through the winter, initially remaining in their pupal cell. They emerge in the summer and live for 6-8 months. The adults' diet is not well known, but they have been observed lapping up the sap of ash trees. =Predators= Different predators attack different life stages of Dynastes tityus. The eggs are vulnerable to attack from a predatory mite. The grubs are eaten by mammals including skunks and raccoons, and soil-dwelling arthropods, including centipedes, ground beetles, spiders and the maggots of Mydas flies. Taxonomy and names Dynastes tityus is known by a number of common names, including eastern Hercules beetle, elephant beetle and ox beetle.. Cite by It was first given a scientific name by Carl Linnaeus, in his 1763 work Centuria Insectorum, where it was called Scarabaeus tityus; when Linnaeus' genus Scarabaeus was divided into smaller genera, S. tityus was renamed Dynastes tityus.

In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he participated in the captures of Veracruz, Tuxpan, and Tabasco. Fighting on the Union side in the Civil War, he took part in the relief of Fort Pickens, followed by many engagements on the Lower Mississippi, before being promoted captain of USS Brooklyn and assisting in the Union victory in the Battle of Mobile Bay. Early career Alden was born in Portland, Maine, and was a direct descendant of John Alden, a Mayflower pilgrim. He was appointed midshipman on April 1, 1828 and spent the initial years of his naval career ashore at the Naval Station in Boston, Massachusetts before he served in the Mediterranean Squadron on board the sloop of war USS John Adams. Promoted to passed midshipman on June 14, 1834, Alden then served at the Boston Navy Yard until he was assigned to the United States Exploring Expedition under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes. During the course of his first voyage (1838‚Äì1842), the officers and men of the expedition were transferred freely from one vessel to another; Alden, promoted to lieutenant on February 25, 1841, concluded the cruise as executive officer of the sloop USS Porpoise. He saw action at Malolo, in the Fiji Islands, on July 26, 1840, in the punitive expedition against the tribe which had murdered Lieutenant Joseph Underwood and Midshipman Wilkes Henry two days before. Henry was a nephew of the expedition's leader. After another tour of duty at the naval station at Boston, Alden was assigned to USS Constitution, and circumnavigated the globe in the frigate during her cruise under Captain John (\\"Mad Jack\\") Percival. While serving therein, he commanded a boat expedition that cut out several war junks from under the guns of a fort at Zuron Bay, Cochin China. Later serving in the Home Squadron during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846), Alden, an adept surveyor, participated in the captures of Veracruz, Tuxpan, and Tabasco. Coast Survey Following the war with Mexico, Alden served as inspector of provisions and clothing at Boston until detached from this duty on May 18, 1849 to go to Washington, D.C., and report to the Secretary of the Treasury for duty with the United States Coast Survey. From the summer of 1849 to the late winter of 1851, he commanded, in succession, the Coast Survey steamers John Y. Mason and Walker in survey duty off the eastern seaboard. Assigned to duty on the Pacific coast thereafter, Alden traveled to San Francisco where he replaced William Pope McArthur as commander of the Coast Survey Schooner Ewing. He arrived in May 1851 and surveyed from San Francisco to San Diego, reporting on the expedition from San Francisco on February 17, 1852. =Active= In 1852, he assumed command of the Coast Survey steamer Active, purchased to replace the wrecked Jefferson (the Ewing was temporarily abandoned,) and carried out survey work off the United States West Coast into 1860. During this time, on September 1, 1855, he was promoted to commander. Indian disturbances in Washington Territory in January 1856 highlighted Alden's tour of duty in command of Active, and his ship, joining the sloop-of- war USS Decatur and the steamer USS Massachusetts, proved \\"of great service\\" during those troubled times. Active operated in the headwaters of Puget Sound, where her presence reassured the settlers. In the summer of 1859, during tensions incident to an American's killing a Britisher's pig on San Juan Island, Actives timely arrival at that isle apparently helped to quiet a potentially dangerous situation in what became later known as the \\"Pig War.\\" U.S. Civil War James Alden Jr. The outbreak of the American Civil War in the spring of 1861 found Alden in command of the steamer USS South Carolina, in which he participated in the relief of Fort Pickens. Next given the steam sloop USS Richmond, Alden commanded her in the passage of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, and in the engagements with Confederate batteries at Chalmette, Louisiana, twice passing the southern guns at Vicksburg, Mississippi, and in the battle at Port Hudson, Louisiana. Promoted to captain on January 2, 1863, Alden next assumed command of the steam sloop USS Brooklyn, and led that ship in the action with Fort Gaines and Fort Morgan and with the Confederate gunboats in the Battle of Mobile Bay. While Brooklyn was being sent north for repairs, she was attached to the naval forces gathering off Fort Fisher, North Carolina, and took part in both assaults on that Confederate bastion. Promotion and late career Promoted to commodore on July 25, 1866, Alden, over the next two years, commanded, in succession, the steam sloop USS Susquehanna and the steam frigate USS Minnesota before he was made commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard. Appointed Chief of the Bureau of Navigation in April 1869 and promoted to rear admiral on June 19, 1871, Alden returned to sea in 1871 with orders to command the naval force on the European Station. Departing New York in his flagship, USS Wabash, on November 17, 1871, Alden relieved Rear Admiral Charles S. Boggs at Villefranche, France, on January 1, 1872. Although placed on the retired list on March 31, 1872, Alden remained on active duty commanding the European Fleet until relieved by Rear Admiral A. Ludlow Case at Villefranche on June 2, 1873.

The brewery produces two brands, the Fordham brand and the Dominion brand, under one operation. Since 2007 the two breweries joined together as one business and by 2009 both brands were then produced together in Dover, Delaware. The brewery, as a whole, brews over 20 different styles of beer, both year-round and seasonal products. The brewery also makes specialty soda under the Dominion name, including Root Beer, Orange Cream, Black Cherry, and Ginger Ale. History From 1996 to 2006, Old Dominion hosted an annual beer festival that showcased small brewers from around the region, as well as some breweries from around the US and Europe. The festival featured more than 50 breweries and live music. The three-day event was held each year on the last full weekend of June; management and organization of the festival was given over to Vintage 50, which now hosts the event twice a year, in June and October. Old Dominion has been fertile ground for producing high quality brewers, such as: John Mallet at Bell's Brewery, Ron Barchet at Victory Brewing Company, Matthew Hagerman at Lost Rhino Brewing Company, Favio Garcia at Lost Rhino Brewing and Dynasty Brewing, and Kenny Allen at True Respite Brewing Company. Bailey put Old Dominion up for sale in the mid-2000s. No serious offers to purchase the company were made until 2007, when Fordham Brewing of Annapolis, Maryland offered to purchase the company, financed in part by Anheuser-Busch (AB) for a minority stake in the two breweries, to form Coastal Brewing Company. The majority of Coastal is owned by Fordham Brewing Company, owned by Bill Muhlhauser (owner of both Fordham and the Ram's Head Taverns of Maryland) and other partners. Anheuser-Busch's purchase stake gave them no control of either of the two breweries, nor any input or influence on brewery recipes, nor oversight of any day-to-day management. The brewery also owns its own distribution rights. Old Dominion also operated a brewpub at the Ashburn brewery, which was closed in August 2008. In the year prior to the acquisition by Anheuser Busch/Fordham, the Brewpub had posted record sales of $2.1 million and had seen positive growth for more than a decade. Due to declining quality and a disillusioned customer base that largely abandoned their beloved once- local brewery, AB/Fordham was forced to cease operations of the Brewpub after 13 years of operation and profitability. Immediately after the sale, the brewers at Old Dominion worked with the brewers at Fordham for several months to ensure a consistent recipe transition. After the breweries combined operations, Coastal Brewing increased its focus on Old Dominion's core/popular brands. Their most popular series is their newest Pinup Series. Candi, their Belgian Tripel won Gold in the 2014 World Beer Cup. Also noted for the Double D Double IPA. Contrary to some accounts, AB-InBev had no input or influence on these decisions; they were solely based on economic concerns over the contract brands failing to meet sales expectations. In May 2009 all brewing operations, combined with those of Fordham Brewing, were moved to a new facility in Dover, Delaware. The current core brands of the brewery continue to sell briskly in both the on-site and packaging ends, and can be found as the \\"house\\" brews at many locations throughout the DC Metro area, including the Great American Restaurant chain (except for the Sweetwater Tavern in Centreville, Virginia), Capital One Arena, and Nationals Park. Old Dominion continues to host various brew sampling and cask events throughout the DC-MD-VA-DE-NJ-PA metropolitan area, maintaining their status as a Mid-Atlantic regional brewer, and their Oak Barrel Stout and Pinup Series brands remain popular sellers in the packaging end of the line, available at several retail and grocery chains, bars and retailers in their regions. As of January 2011, Jim Lutz (former VP of sales and marketing at Flying Dog Brewery of Frederick, MD), took over as the new President and CEO of Coastal Brewing.

There are two variants based on the age of onset: juvenile and adult laryngeal papillomatosis. The tumors are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the throat. The tumors may lead to narrowing of the airway, which may cause vocal changes or airway obstruction. Laryngeal papillomatosis is initially diagnosed through indirect laryngoscopy upon observation of growths on the larynx and can be confirmed through a biopsy. Treatment for laryngeal papillomatosis aims to remove the papillomas and limit their recurrence. Due to the recurrent nature of the virus, repeated treatments usually are needed. Laryngeal papillomatosis is primarily treated surgically, though supplemental nonsurgical and/or medical treatments may be considered in some cases. The evolution of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly variable. Though total recovery may be observed, it is often persistent despite treatment. The number of new cases of laryngeal papillomatosis cases is at approximately 4.3 cases per 100,000 children and 1.8 cases per 100,000 adults annually. __TOC__  Signs and symptoms  A common symptom of laryngeal papillomatosis is a perceptual change in voice quality. More specifically, hoarseness is observed. As a consequence of the narrowing of the laryngeal or tracheal parts of the airway, shortness of breath, chronic cough and stridor (i.e. noisy breathing which can sound like a whistle or a snore), can be present. As the disease progresses, occurrence of secondary symptoms such as dysphagia, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, failure to thrive, and recurrent upper respiratory infections can be diagnosed. The risk of laryngeal papillomatosis spreading to the lungs is higher in the juvenile-onset than the adult-onset. In children, symptoms are usually more severe and often mistaken for manifestations of other diseases such as asthma, croup or bronchitis. Therefore, diagnosis is usually delayed. Cause Laryngeal papillomatosis is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, most frequently genotypes 6 and 11 although genotypes 16, 18, 31, and 33 have also been implicated. HPV-11 is associated with more aggressive forms of papillomatosis, which may involve more distal parts of the tracheobronchial tree. The mode of viral inoculation is hypothesized to vary according to age of disease onset. The presence of HPV in the respiratory tract does not necessarily result in the development of laryngeal papillomatosis. Other factors that could be involved include immunodeficiency or other similar infections. For example, laryngeal papillomatosis may become more aggressive due to the presence of certain viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus). The disease is typically separated into two forms, juvenile and adult papillomatosis, based on whether it develops before or after 20 years of age. The juvenile form is generally transmitted through contact with a mother's infected vaginal canal during childbirth. Less is known about transmission in the adult form of this disease, though oral sex has been implicated as a potential mode of transmission. However, it is uncertain whether oral sex would directly transmit the virus or activate the dormant virus that was transmitted at childbirth. In general, physicians are unsure why only certain people who have been exposed to the HPV types implicated in the disease develop laryngeal papillomatosis. In the case of the juvenile form of the disease, the likelihood of a child born of an infected mother developing laryngeal papillomatosis is low (between 1 in 231 to 1 in 400), even if the mother's infection is active. Risk factors for a higher likelihood of transmission at childbirth include the first birth, vaginal birth, and teenage mother. There are three big risk factors that contribute to the acquirement of the juvenile variant. These include: * Birth history (e.g., increased time spent in vaginal delivery) and the presence of HPV in the vaginal canal. It is important to note that it is still uncertain whether caesarean delivery is a protective factor. * Genotype of the HPV (e.g., HPV-11) * Individual factors (e.g., being younger when diagnosed, which may be due to a less developed immune system). Diagnosis Laryngeal papillomatosis can be diagnosed through visualization of the lesions using one of several indirect laryngoscopy procedures. In indirect laryngoscopy, the tongue is pulled forward and a laryngeal mirror or a rigid scope is passed through the mouth to examine the larynx. Another variation of indirect laryngoscopy involves passing a flexible scope, known as a fiberscope or endoscope, through the nose and into the throat to visualize the larynx from above. This procedure is also called flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. The appearance of papillomas has been described as multiple or rarely, single, white growths with a lumpy texture similar to cauliflower. Papillomas usually present in the larynx, especially on the vocal folds and in the space above the vocal folds called the ventricles. They can spread to other parts of the larynx and throughout the aerodigestive tract, from the mouth to the lower respiratory tract. Spread to regions beyond the larynx is more common in children than adults. Growths tend to be located at normal junctions in squamous and ciliated epithelium or at tissue junctions arising from injury. A confirmatory diagnosis of laryngeal papillomatosis can only be obtained through a biopsy, involving microscopic examination and HPV testing of a sample of the growth. Biopsy samples are collected under general anesthesia, either through direct laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscopy.  Prevention  Little is known in terms of effective means of prevention, if the mother is infected with HPV. (HPV vaccination can prevent these infections in the mother, and thereby eliminate the possibility of the virus infecting the baby.) Due to the low likelihood of transmission even from an infected mother, it is not recommended to expose the mother and child to the additional risks of caesarean section to prevent the transmission of this disease during vaginal childbirth. Opting for a caesarean section does not guarantee that transmission will not still occur.  Treatment  As of 2014 there was no permanent cure for laryngeal papillomatosis, and treatment options aimed to remove and limit the recurrence of the papillomas. Repeated treatments are often needed because of the recurrent nature of the virus, especially for children, as the juvenile form of laryngeal papillomatosis often triggers more aggressive relapses than the adult form. Between recurrences, voice therapy may be used to restore or maintain the person's voice function. = Surgery = The first line of treatment is surgery to remove papillomas. Typically performed using a laryngeal endoscopy, surgery can protect intact tissues and the individual's voice, as well as ensure that the airway remains unobstructed by the disease. However, surgery does not prevent recurrences, and can lead to a number of serious complications. Laser technology, and carbon dioxide laser surgery in particular, has been used since the 1970s for the removal of papillomas; however, laser surgery is not without its risks, and has been associated with a higher occurrence of respiratory tract burns, stenosis, severe laryngeal scarring, and tracheoesophagyeal fistulae. Tracheotomies are offered for the most aggressive cases, where multiple debulking surgery failures have led to airways being compromised. The tracheotomies use breathing tubes to reroute air around the affected area, thereby restoring the person's breathing function. Although this intervention is usually temporary, some people must use the tube indefinitely. This method should be avoided if at all possible, since the breathing tube may serve as a conduit for spread of the disease as far down as the tracheobronchal tree. A microdebrider is a tool that can suction tissue into a blade, which then cuts the tissue. Microdebriders are gradually replacing laser technology as the treatment of choice for laryngeal papillomatosis, due to their ability to selectively suction papillomas while relatively sparing unaffected tissue. In addition to the lower risk of complications, microdebrider surgery also is reportedly less expensive, less time-consuming, and more likely to give the person a better voice quality than the traditional laser surgery approaches. = Nonsurgical adjuvant treatment = For about 20% of people, surgery is not sufficient to control their laryngeal papillomatosis, and additional nonsurgical and/or medical treatments are necessary. , these treatments alone are not sufficient to cure laryngeal papillomatosis, and can only be considered supplemental to surgery. Some varieties of nonsurgical treatments include interferon, antiviral drugs (especially cidofovir, but also ribavirin and acyclovir), and photodynamic therapy. The monoclonal antibody against Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), Bevacizumab has shown promising result as an adjuvant therapy in the management of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.Mohr M, Schliemann C, Biermann C, Schmidt L-H, Kessler T, Schmidt J, et al. Rapid response to systemic bevacizumab therapy in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Oncol Lett. 2014 Nov;8(5):1912‚Äì8.Sidell DR, Nassar M, Cotton RT, Zeitels SM, de Alarcon A. High-dose sublesional bevacizumab (avastin) for pediatric recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol. 2014 Mar;123(3):214‚Äì21. Although vaccines are normally used to prevent infections from happening, HPV vaccines can be used therapeutically (after the infection has occurred). For most patients, the HPV vaccine significantly increases the length of time needed between surgeries.  Outcomes  The evolution of laryngeal papillomatosis is highly unpredictable and is characterized by modulation of its severity and variable rate of progression across individuals. While instances of total recovery are observed, the condition is often persistent and lesions can reappear even after treatment. Factors that might affect the clinical course of the condition include: the HPV genotype, the age at onset, the elapsed time between the diagnosis and first treatment in addition to previous medical procedures. Other factors, albeit controversial, such as smoking or the presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease might also play a role in the progression of the disease. The papillomas can travel past the larynx and infect extralaryngeal sites. In more aggressive cases, infection of the lungs can occur with progressive airway obstruction. Although rare (less than 1% of people with laryngeal papillomatosis), transformation from a benign form to a malignant form is also observed. Death can result from these complications (morbidity rate is around 1-2%).  Epidemiology  Laryngeal papillomatosis is a rare disease with a bimodal distribution based on age of incidence. The incidence, or number of new cases, of laryngeal papillomatosis cases is at approximately 4.3 cases per 100 000 children and 1.8 cases per 100 000 adults annually. The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children peaks before the age of 5, though the term juvenile papillomatosis refers to all cases occurring before the age of 20. The incidence of adult laryngeal papillomatosis, which has an onset after the age of 20, peaks between the ages of 20 and 40. While there are no gender differences in the incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis in children, adult laryngeal papillomatosis occurs more frequently in males than in females. The incidence of laryngeal papillomatosis also varies according to factors such as socioeconomic status, such that higher rates are observed in groups having a lower socioeconomic status. Costs Because of its relative commonness and the cost of treatments, more money is spent on treating RRP than any other benign airway tumor. Research As of 2015 use of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine to reduce rate of recurrences had been investigated, but had not yielded significant results.

It replaced a large section of U.S. Route 71 and Alternate US 71 in sections. The first section was between Lanagan and the Arkansas state line when US 71 was moved down the former Route 88. In the 1990s, US 71 was moved and upgraded to interstate standards from Neosho to Lanagan and Route 59 was extended north to Neosho. When US 71 was moved east of Joplin in the late 1990s, Alternate US 71 was deleted, and Route 59 was extended north to replace that highway. The highway was numbered after Arkansas Highway 59. Route description Route 59 is a two-lane highway for its entire length except for a short section in southern Neosho where it forms a concurrency with Business US 71. The highway begins at I-44/I-49/US 71 in Fidelity and heads south. There is an interchange with the northern junction with U.S. Route 60 northeast of Neosho. The road remains two-lane (US 60 is also two-lane here) for the interchange, which was built due to numerous accidents at the former intersection. The two highways then run concurrent to the south side of Neosho. About three miles (5 km) south of the 59/60 interchange is the northern junction of Route 86, which continues west about one half mile later. Route 59 then curves west where it splits off from US 60 at Business I-49. Route 59 then unites with southbound Business I-49 for about two miles (3 km) until Business I-49 turns off west. Route 59 begins to turn into a windy road as it heads into McDonald County. South of Goodman is a partial interchange with I-49/US 71. At Anderson is a short concurrency with Route 76, and the road runs next to the Kansas City Southern Railway for several miles. As Route 59 approaches Noel, it runs into a very scenic area, squeezed between steep bluffs and the railroad. After entering Noel, it form a short concurrency with Route 90 and runs under some of the bluffs along the Elk River (with signs warning of low clearance for trucks).

Unusually for the time, Ballard kept a diary with thousands of entries over nearly three decades, which has provided historians with invaluable insight into frontier-women's lives. Ballard was made famous by the publication of A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard based on her diary, 1785‚Äì1812 by historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich in 1990. Life Martha Moore was born in Oxford, Province of Massachusetts, on February 9, 1735, to the family of Elijah Moore and Dorothy Learned Moore. Nothing is known about her childhood and education, but it is known that her family had medical links; her uncle Abijah Moore and brother-in-law Stephen Barton were physicians. She married Ephraim Ballard in 1754. The couple had nine children between 1756 and 1779, but lost three of them to a diphtheria epidemic in Oxford between June 17 and July 5, 1769. Ballard delivered 816 babies over the 27 years that she wrote her diary and was present at more than 1,000 births; the mortality rates of infants and mothers that she visited were ordinary for the United States before the 1940s. Her diary also recorded her administering medicines and remedies, which she made herself mostly from local plants and occasionally from ingredients bought from a local physician. Ballard was sometimes called to observe autopsies and recorded 85 instances of what she called \\"desections\\" in her diary. She also took testimonies from unwed mothers that was used in paternity suits. She testified in 1789 in a high-profile case of a judge accused of raping a minister's wife. In addition to her medical and judicial responsibilities, Ballard frequently carried out tasks such as trading, weaving, and social visits. She and her family experienced difficult times during 1803‚Äì1804, when her husband was imprisoned for debt and her son was indicted for fraud. Ballard's obituary was published on June 9, 1812 in the American Advocate and simply stated: Ballard was related to Clara Barton, known for her American Civil War work and for founding the American Red Cross. Clara was the granddaughter of Ballard's sister, Dorothy Barton. = Diary = From when she was 50 (1785) until her death in 1812, Martha Ballard kept a diary that recorded her work and domestic life in Hallowell on the Kennebec River, District of Maine. The log of daily events, written with a quill pen and homemade ink, records numerous babies delivered and illnesses treated as she travelled by horse or canoe around the Massachusetts frontier in what is today the state of Maine. For 27 years, she wrote in the diary daily, often by candlelight when her family had gone to bed. The diary consists of more than 1,400 pages, with entries that start with the weather and the time. Many of her early records are short and choppy, but her later entries are longer and detailed. Her writing illustrates struggles and tragedies within her own family and local crimes and scandals. One includes the comment that children in New England are allowed to choose their romantic interest if they were in the same economic class, rare for the time. Many of the people mentioned in the diary do not appear on official records, such as censuses or deeds and probate, and so the diary helps to provide insight into the lives of ordinary people who might otherwise have remained invisible. Because of the scale of the diary, scholars have been able to use digital tools to mine it for information. Such studies have revealed, for instance, that because Ballard's deliveries spike significantly between February and April, her neighbours are most likely to be having sex between May and July. The last birth that Ballard attended was on April 26, 1812. Ballard's final diary entry, from 1812, states: \\"made a prayer adapted to my case.\\" After Ballard's death, the diary was kept by Dolly Lambard. The diary was then passed on to Dolly's daughters, Sarah Lambard and Hannah Lambard Walcott after Dolly's death in 1861. Sarah Lambard and Hannah Lambard gifted the diary to Ballard's great-great- granddaughter, Mary Hobart, one of the first female US physicians to graduate from the New York Infirmary for Women and Children in 1884, the same year that she received the diary. In 1930, Hobart donated the diary to the Maine State Library in Augusta. Maine State Library promised Hobart a transcript of the diary, but the promise was never fulfilled. Charles Elventon Nash included parts of the diary in a proposed two-volume history of Augusta, which was kept in a descendant's home for almost 60 years before the descendant offered it to the Maine State Library. Edith Hary took the papers and published The History of Augusta: First Settlements and Early Days As A Town Including The Diary of Mrs. Martha Moore Ballard in 1961.In July 1982, E. Wheaton of the Maine State Archive created a microfilm copy of the diary. Robert R. McCausland and Cynthia MacAlman McCausland later spent ten years producing a verbatim transcription on the diary, which they made freely available online as well as for purchase in hard-copy. = A Midwife's Tale = For many years, Martha Ballard's diary was not considered to be of scholarly interest since it was generally dismissed as repetitive and ordinary. However, historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich saw potential in the diary, realising how rare Ballard's first-hand account was after having researched a previous book on women in early New England. After eight years of research, Ulrich produced A Midwife's Tale: The Life of Martha Ballard based on her diary, 1785‚Äì1812. Each chapter in A Midwife's Tale represents one aspect of the life of a woman in the late 18th century. The overriding theme is the nature of women's work in the context and community. Ulrich stated that: Supporting documents construct Ulrich's interpretation of terse and circumspect diary entries, dealing with medical practice and the prevalence of violence and crime. In \\"A Midwife‚Äôs Tale\\", Ulrich highlights ten key entries from Martha's diary. Ulrich places these entries in a historical context, elevating a seemingly-ordinary woman's life into a key figure of Kennebec. Listed below are summaries of each key entry of the diary and its historical significance. *Section 1 The first entry in \\"A Midwife‚Äôs Tale\\" puts midwifery in a broader medical context within the Kennebec region. This chapter establishes the relationship between doctors and midwives during this time period. Doctors were called only to perform extreme medical practices such as bloodletting and typically had 8-10 cases per year. Martha recorded 816 births over 27 years, and midwives were the first called when a woman went into labor. Ulrich also introduces the concept of ‚Äúsocial medicine‚Äùname=\\"Ulrich\\" in this chapter, referring to the sharing of information among midwives and doctors. This is evident in midwife manuals and communities of midwives that gathered and interacted during births. *Section 2 This chapter shows the separate economy among women in Hallowell. The economy is facilitated by the \\"social webs\\" of production and consumption. Martha's diary separates roles of men and women. Men were involved in the politics of the town whereas women had a separate community where they exchanged textiles. Martha's daughters were able to take over the work of spinning and weaving and helping with harvests when they became older, which allowed Martha to have the time to devote to midwifery. Without Martha's detailed records of her exchanges, historians would lack the knowledge of the economy that existed among women. *Section 3 This entry follows an important rape trial in Hallowell. Mrs. Foster accused Judge North of raping her while her husband was away. Historians are able to contrast Martha's account of the trial with Henry Sewall's account. Henry Sewall opposes the Fosters' religious beliefs, but Martha feels sympathetic toward the Fosters because others judged them for their religious beliefs. *Section 4 This section is concerned with the three Ballard family marriages that occurred in 1792. Martha describes all three weddings, but it is noteworthy that while two are fairly domestic, one is quite dramatic. The mid-18th century is seen as a turning point in history since children began to choose their own partners, which is supported by Ballard's diary entries. It seems as if all of the Ballard marriages in 1792 were courtships chosen by the children, as opposed to arrangements proposed for economic benefits. Additionally, pre-marital sex is mentioned. *Section 5 This chapter details the 53 deliveries that Ballard performed in 1793, an important year for her. She delivers babies from celebrity wives like those of Captain Molloy and Esquire Hayward but also babies of servants. Ballard travels far and wide to deliver babies, which she discusses in her diary entries as well. Ulrich emphasizes that an average of one baby a week seems easy, but Martha often sits for weeks doing nothing and, for others, facing multiple births in a short time during poor weather. Additionally, women have contractions that do not result in labor, forcing them to decide between risking it and not calling for Martha or having her come without actually needing her. That happened at the Parker house, to where she traveled four times before actually delivering the baby, number 51. *Section 6 The focus is 1796, a physically taxing year for her and her husband. She is traveling to deliver babies in flea-infested cabins while her husband works in swamps swarming with mosquitos. Their children also have some health issues that year. In November, her husband, Ephraim, is at muskie-point, and all of his instruments were stolen at the outset of a planned extended surveying journey, canceling the trip, but he returns five days later. On the same day or around the same time, Martha delivered her 600th baby, a milestone. Ephraim‚Äôs work continues to be difficult. Martha prays for strength to continue faring through her difficult and laborious life. *Section 7 This section follows the death and autopsy of John Davis, the son of John Vassall Davis in Kennebec. This is an important death in the diary because John Davis is legally a bastard with a prominent father in Kennebec. Ulrich fleshes out the significance of Martha's presence at the autopsy. Her presence was a common practice for midwives in her time. Ulrich discusses the change in 1820, when a Harvard Medical School professor publishes a treatise stating that women should no longer be midwives as they are too uneducated to practice medicine. *Section 8 This chapter tracks Martha's entries while her husband, Ephraim Ballard, is in jail for debt. During this time, Martha's son, Jonathan, takes over Matha and Ephraim's house. Entries highlight Martha and Jonathan's rocky relationship. Additionally, Martha experiences a pseudo-widowhood during this time, acknowledging Ephraim's role in the household that now must be filled by her son. This entry gives important information regarding jail time in Kennebec, as Ephraim is allowed to continue working during the day and must sleep at the jail only at night. There is flexibility regarding cases of debt. *Section 9 This chapter is centered around a mass murder that occurred in Hallowell. James Purrinton, one of Martha's neighbors, murdered his wife and all of his children but one, who escaped. Martha's entry adds another viewpoint on this historic event. Ulrich writes, \\"The economy of Martha's telling contrasts with the more self-conscious narrative published (and probably composed) by Peter Edes, editor of Augusta‚Äôs Kennebec Gazette.\\"name=\\"Ulrich\\" *Section 10 The final chapter focuses on Martha's perspective on the Malta War between settlers and proprietors over land ownership. The insurgents were led by Elijah Barton, Martha's nephew. Additionally, Ulrich discusses the importance of women in field agriculture, as characterized by Martha‚Äôs garden and her records of the flowers and vegetables she planted in her time. As Martha grows older, her diary recounts fewer births. Ulrich hypothesizes that the decrease in births is caused by another midwife taking over her work. The midwife is likely Ann Mosier since after Martha records Ann's death, Martha's workload increases. The chapter concludes with Martha's last entry on May 7 and her death approximately three weeks later. =Reviews= The book received a positive critical response and was praised for its insight into the lives of 18th-century women and life in early New England. In 1991, A Midwife's Tale received the Pulitzer Prize, the Bancroft Prize, the John H. Dunning Prize, the Joan Kelly Memorial Prize in Women's History, the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians Book Prize, the Society for Historians of the Early Republic Book Prize, the William Henry Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine, and the New England Historical Association Award. In 1997, the PBS series The American Experience aired A Midwife's Tale. This documentary film was based upon Ulrich‚Äôs book, and Ulrich served as a consultant, script collaborator, and narrator for the film. It was directed by Richard P. Rogers, and produced by Laurie Kahn-Leavitt. Actress Kaluani Sewell Lee played Martha Ballard. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities. When filming the series, details were given close attention. The production crew chose King's Landing Historical Settlement in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island to capture Maine's three seasons: \\"black flies, snow and mud.\\" The actors wore mud-soaked shoes below historically-accurate costumes, and replicas were made of the hand sewn booklets that formed the diary, so that Lee could write in them. The music in the film, played by the ensemble Orison, included shape note singing by the Word of Mouth Chorus.

In this context, papilla refers to the projection created by the tumor, not a tumor on an already existing papilla (such as the nipple). When used without context, it frequently refers to infections (squamous cell papilloma) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), such as warts. Human papillomavirus infection is a major cause of cervical cancer, although most HPV infections do not cause cancer. There are, however, a number of other conditions that cause papilloma, as well as many cases in which there is no known cause. Signs and symptoms A benign papillomatous tumor is derived from epithelium, with cauliflower-like projections that arise from the mucosal surface. It may appear white or normal colored. It may be pedunculated or sessile. The average size is between 1‚Äì5 cm. Neither sex is significantly more likely to develop them. The most common site is the palate- uvula area followed by tongue and lips. Durations range from weeks to 10 years. Cause Immunoperoxidase stains have identified antigens of the human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11 in approximately 50% of cases of squamous cell papilloma. Prognosis There is no evidence that papillomas are premalignant. Differential diagnosis * Intraoral verruca vulgaris, * Condyloma acuminatum, and * Focal epithelial hyperplasia. Note: differentiation is done accurately by microscopic examination only. Treatment With conservative surgical excision, recurrence is rare.

He has been with the station since its inception in 1987. Personal life Somers is a native of San Francisco, California, and became a fan of the San Francisco Giants upon the team's arrival to the city in 1958. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1969. He currently resides in Manhattan. His nickname is \\"The Schmoozer.\\" He is a New York Mets and New York Rangers and New York Knicks and New York Jets fan. Career Somers began his career in the Bay Area. Before graduating high school, he worked at KYA radio in San Francisco delivering on air high school sports reports. After college, Somers began hosting a news talk show on KABL radio in San Francisco long before the talk radio format became popular. To that effect, Time Magazine ran a story naming him the youngest talk show host in the country at that period of time. Somers also worked a public address announcer for the NBA's San Francisco Warriors. In 1970, Somers joined KPIX in San Francisco as a weekend sports anchor and won a San Francisco Press Club Award. Over the next decade and a half he held other television sportscasting positions at KOVR in Sacramento, WXIA-TV in Atlanta and KNBC in Los Angeles. While in Los Angeles, he also launched a sports talk program at KMPC radio. Somers joined WFAN at the station's inception in July 1987. He spent his first few years with the station as the overnight host.While he was on the overnight program he dubbed himself \\"Captain Midnight\\". During this time he conducted one of the last ever interviews with Mark Koenig, who was the last living member of the 1927 New York Yankees. He later spent a few years co-hosting the 10am-1pm slot with WWOR-TV sports anchor Russ Salzberg. The program was titled \\"The Sweater and the Schmoozer.\\" At that time, Somers developed some of the quirks that have been hallmarks of his WFAN tenure, dropping catchphrases such as \\"schmoooooozing S-P-O-R-T-S\\" (spelling out the word \\"sports\\"), giving time checks in minutes and seconds, uniquely reading the end of the station's phone number as \\"six-six-six-six\\" rather than the standard \\"sixty six-sixty six\\", joking at the expense of engineer Eddie Scozzare (\\"THE Eddie Scozzare?\\" \\"No, Eddie Maple, who do you think we're talking?\\"), and reading the catalogue numbers of live commercials (\\"LV-242, for those of you scoring at home, and I know you are...\\"). He is also known to refer to the New York Mets, by one of their nicknames (which is not the official name) \\"The New York Metropolitans\\" drawing out the parts as Metro-Politans, and referring to the Islanders as the Ice-landers. Currently, Somers usually works during the evening on weekdays. His program can be heard anywhere from 6:30pm to 2am, depending on whether WFAN airs a sporting event that night. He is also sometimes heard on weekends. He is colloquially known as \\"The Schmoozer.\\" Somers has said of the infrequent scheduling, \\"Sometimes, just sometimes, I forget what time zone I live in.\\" = Film = Somers appeared in the 1979 film The Visitor.

He was commissioned in the Plymouth Division of the Royal Marines on 21 April 1809 and served in the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812.Navy List 1814, p30 During this latter conflict, he served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Marines commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Williams.NICOLAS, p272 He also served in Syria in 1840.NICOLAS, p332 He was reputed to be a strict disciplinarian, and in 1844 arrived as commandant of Norfolk Island to replace Alexander Maconochie whose progressive views on penal administration were thought to be unsuitable for this establishment. However, Childs proved to be no match for the convict 'old hands'. His 'strict discipline' may have worked on the thoroughly disciplined men of the Royal Marines, but he had no experience of life in a penal settlement. General discipline was poor and left to subordinate guards and overseers who had little control over the prison which was ruled by the 'Ring' of hardened convicts. A visiting magistrate reported that while Childs was \\"a most amiable benevolent gentleman and honorable officer\\" what was needed to avoid anarchy and insubordination was \\"an officer of experience in, or capacity for, government, judgement, energy, decision and firmness\\". Childs was recalled but, before he left, a group of convicts revolted in July 1846, murdering four officials. Thirteen convicts were convicted of murder and hanged by Childs' successor, John Price, who considered Childs responsible for the state of affairs that led to the revolt. A newspaper report at the time blamed the situation on Childs' \\"utter imbecility\\". Childs returned to England and continued to serve in the Royal Marines. He retired in 1857 and died in Cornwall on 2 January 1870.

He played professionally first for London Wasps and then Bedford Blues in the 1990s. In Canada he played for James Bay and UBCOB Ravens (British Columbia Rugby Union). He earned an M.B.A. degree from UBC in 1991. He also played for Western Suburbs in Wellington, New Zealand. He earned 15 caps for Canada between 1987 and 1994, and was part of the team that reached the quarter-final of the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Career Hadley captained his national side five times in 1992-3, including on 17 October 1992 at Wembley Stadium, a 13-26 (1 try to 4) loss to England. On that day Hadley eclipsed his English counterparts Wade Dooley and Martin Bayfield, and rallied an understrength Canadian side to a respectable outcome. Many however point to Canada's narrow quarter-final defeat to the New Zealand All Blacks in the 1991 World Cup as Canada's finest hour, where Hadley and a big, tough forward pack clearly had the upper hand over New Zealand. That highly-regarded 1991 Canadian team made a big impact defeating Fiji and Romania and giving both France and New Zealand difficult games. Always outspoken, a dispute with national team management saw him not play the 1995 World Cup, where his team desperately needed him in a tough pool that included South Africa and Australia. Following a dominant performance in the 1991 World Cup, he was named to the World Team (as selected by Rugby World magazine), and was subsequently chosen to play for the Barbarians against the World Cup winners Australia at Twickenham in 1992. His locking partner for the Barbarians that day was All Black Ian Jones. He went on to represent the Barbarians another four times. He was named Athlete of the Year in his home town of Victoria, B.C. following the World Cup in 1991. While working in London and playing for Wasps, he gained perhaps his greatest notoriety for roughing up two hooligans on the London Underground, an act which not only earned him praiseworthy column inches in the British broadsheets and tabloids, but even gained him a mention in the House of Commons by then Prime Minister John Major. Already a well-known pundit on BBC TV's Rugby Special weekly program, offers for more TV appearances followed. Hadley has one daughter, Madison Elle Watson.

At Cape Fair is the southern terminus of Route 173. At the Barry County line, Route 76 enters the Mark Twain National Forest for a third time. Eight miles () into the forest is a short, one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency with Route 39. At the west limits of the national forest, Route 76 unites with Route 86; they are concurrent for . At Cassville is a short concurrency with Route 112 and an intersection with Route 37. The road becomes less winding and hilly in this area. At Wheaton, Route 86 turns north. Route 76 continues west through McDonald County. At Anderson, Route 76 has an interchange with Interstate 49/U.S. Route 71, and just west is a two-mile (3 km) concurrency with Route 59. Seven miles west of Anderson, the highway joins Route 43, turning north with that highway three miles. At the northwest junction, Route 76 turns west for one mile (1.6 km) and enters Tiff City. The western limit of Tiff City is the Oklahoma state line, where Route 76 becomes a county road on the county line of Ottawa County and Delaware County, Oklahoma. History Route 76 was initially designated in 1922, running from south of Spokane to Forsyth. The longer Route 78 passed through Forsyth on its path between Branson and the northeast corner of Taney County. In about 1929, Route 76 was extended west to Reeds Spring, and in the early 1930s Route 78 was extended northeast to Ava. With the extension of Route 80 west from Gainesville in the 1930s or 1940s, Route 78 west of Forsyth became part of Route 80, and the rest was absorbed into Route 76, which now connected Reeds Spring to Ava. US 160, designated in Missouri in the mid-1950s, initially followed Route 80 to Branson. It later moved to Route 76 west of Forsyth, and Route 76 was extended west via Branson, replacing part of Route 148 and much of Route 44. Route 44 had been designated in 1922 from Anderson to Abesville, and later extended west to Tiff City and east to Rockaway Beach. In the late 1950s, it was split up due to I-44, becoming Route 76 west of Cassville, Route 148 from Cassville to Galena, and a new Route 176 from Galena to Rockaway Beach. In 1967-68 Route 76 was extended from Route 5 two miles north of Ava east along former State Route F through northeast Douglas County and other county roads to US 60/US 63 at Willow Springs in Howell County.Missouri State Highway Map, 1967Missouri State Highway Map, 1968 This added approximately 53 miles plus a four-mile concurrence with Missouri Route 5 west of Ava. Prior to January 2020, Route 76 ran along 76 Country Boulevard through Branson, where many of the entertainment theaters for which Branson is famous can be found. This alignment was plagued with traffic during much of the day and especially towards show start and end times (usually around 6-8 PM and 9-10PM). Now, Route 76 runs concurrent with US 65 for to the Ozark Mountain High Road, replacing Route 465. At the west end of the highroad, Route 76 returns to its original route, with its former routing through the interchange signed as Route 376.https://www.modot.org/node/17349 Major intersections References 076 Category:Transportation in McDonald County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Barry County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Stone County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Taney County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Douglas County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Howell County, Missouri ","title":"Missouri Route 76"},{"id":"2154113","text":"Ontario Parks is the Ontario government agency in Ontario, Canada, that protects significant natural and cultural resources in a system of parks and protected areas that is sustainable and provides opportunities for inspiration, enjoyment and education. The Ontario Parks system covers over , which is about 10 percent of the province's surface area or the equivalent of an area approximately equal to Nova Scotia. It falls under the responsibility and mandate of the province's Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. It was formerly under the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. The Ontario Parks system is often used as the model for other parks systems in North America. This can be attributed to its delicate balance of recreation, preservation, and conservation. Many parks in Ontario also offer a Natural Heritage Education program. History The Ontario Parks system began its long and rough history in 1893 with the creation of Algonquin Park, originally designed to protect loggers' interests from settlement. The management and creation of provincial parks came under the Department of Lands and Forests in 1954 and led to a period of accelerated park creation: a ninefold increase in the number of parks over the next six years. In the 1970s the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources' (MNR) was formed. The MNR expanded to include forestry operations within the Province, becoming the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) in approximately 2010, and became more focused on Forestry and species protection and enforcement via Conservation Officers. Currently, Ontario Parks does not have full agency status, but is a branch of the Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks (MECP), but, interestingly, Park Wardens are still employed by the MNRF and not the MECP. Until recently, Ontario Parks as a whole was under the mandate of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF). The history of Ontario's provincial parks stretches for over 100 years. Here are some of the milestones from the past century plus: 1893 ‚Äì Algonquin Park is created as a public park and forest reservation, fish and game preserve, health resort and pleasure ground. 1894 ‚Äì Rondeau becomes Ontario's second provincial park. 1913 ‚Äì The Parks Act sets aside land not suitable for agriculture or settlement. 1954 ‚Äì Ontario still has only 8 provincial parks: Algonquin, Quetico, Long Point, Rondeau, Presqu'ile, Ipperwash, Lake Superior and Sibley (now known as Sleeping Giant). A Division of Parks is created within the Department of Lands and Forests. This heralds a new and aggressive program to create more parks, primarily on the Great Lake and northern tourism highways. 1960 ‚Äì There are now 72 provincial parks in Ontario, hosting over 5 million visitors annually. 1967 ‚Äì Ontario introduces a new policy that divides parks into specific categories, or classes, with compatible sets of uses. 1970 ‚Äì Polar Bear, Ontario's largest provincial park at 24,000 square kilometres, is created. 1978 ‚Äì Ontario Provincial Parks: Planning and Management Policies are approved by Cabinet giving Ontario one of the world's leading parks planning systems. 1983 ‚Äì The new land use planning system leads to the announcement of 155 new parks to be designated. 1985 ‚Äì There are now 220 parks in Ontario encompassing over 5.5 million hectares of land. 1993 ‚Äì Ontario celebrates the centennial of the provincial parks system and Algonquin's 100th anniversary. 1996 ‚Äì The provincial parks system adopts a new entrepreneurial operating model where revenue generated by parks can be reinvested in the parks system. This is symbolized by a new name, Ontario Parks, and a new visual identity. 1996 ‚Äì Ontario Parks partners with the Natural Conservancy of Canada to create Legacy 2000, a program to protect significant natural areas. Under this agreement more than 11,000 hectares are secured. 1999 ‚Äì Ontario's Living Legacy is announced. This land use strategy identifies 378 new protected areas, including 61 new parks and 45 parks additions. Ontario's Living Legacy will protect over 2.4 million hectares of land, including additions to the provincial parks system of over 900,000 hectares. 2001 ‚Äì Ontario now has a total of 280 provincial parks encompassing 7.1 million hectares or almost 9 percent of the province's area. Over 9 million visitors annually enjoy Ontario Parks. 2007 ‚Äì Introduction of new legislation: \\"Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act\\" with 329 provincial parks and 292 conservation reserves. 2018 - Ontario Parks changes hands from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) to the newly created Ministry of Environment, Conservation, and Parks. All employees including Park Wardens are now employed by the Ministry of Environment Conservation & Parks 2018 - Ontario celebrates 125 years of the provincial parks system and Algonquin's 125th anniversary Provincial park classes Ontario Parks system uses a classification system to divide the provincial parks into the following categories: *Recreational Class Park \\"typically have good beaches, many campgrounds and lots of outdoor recreation opportunities.

Formed in 1982, they are one of the most influential and prolific comedy duos in Japan today.Japan Zone article Retrieved on 2008-2-21. \\"The biggest name in comedy duos has to be Downtown.\\" They are best known for their stand-up acts, hosting numerous Japanese variety shows (such as Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!, Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ and Wednesday's Downtown) and their sarcastic, short-tempered stage personas. As a result of their massive popularity and the relative domination of their employer, Yoshimoto Kogyo, the Kansai dialect (in which both performers usually speak) has come to be associated with Japanese comedy (owarai) as a whole.Japan Zone's profile on Yoshimoto Kogyo Retrieved on 2008-2-08. \\"Thanks to the huge popularity they have enjoyed these Kansai natives have made the region's dialect almost the de-facto language of comedy in Japan.\\" In 2011, NSC (comedy school) teachers reportedly noted that 70 percent of students name Matsumoto and Hamada as being among their key inspirations.  Members  ;Masatoshi Hamada :Born May 11, 1963 in Naniwa-ku, Osaka and raised in Amagasaki, Hy≈çgo. Plays the tsukkomi. Married to actress Natsumi Ogawa with two sons. Also known as .

A large group of younger comedians express their fear of Hamada, which Matsumoto tries to help over come in this episode. He is often described as \\"sadistic\\". He was referred to as Hama-chon by Matsumoto earlier in his career. ;Hitoshi Matsumoto :Born September 8, 1963 in Amagasaki, Hy≈çgo. Plays the boke. Also known as . Absurdism, sarcasm, and a blunt, ill-tempered persona make up his comedic style. Deadpan is his forte, but he can slip into exaggerated reactions as well. He is the \\"M\\" or masochistic of the duo, and was referred to as Mattsun by Hamada while they were younger.  Background  = Childhood and school years = Matsumoto and Hamada attended and met at Ushio Elementary School in Amagasaki, Hy≈çgo of the Kansai region. They did not become friends until their second year in Amagasaki Taisei Junior High School, where they both joined the school's broadcasting club and called each other and . It is then Matsumoto joked about becoming a comedy duo together and planted the idea into their heads. At the time, Matsumoto was part of a manzai trio called \\"Koma Daisanshibu\\" with two of his classmates, It≈ç and Morioka. Their first television appearance in 1982 at the age of 18 and not yet known as Downtown One day, Matsumoto's manzai partner, It≈ç, had an argument with Hamada which escalated into a street fight. Hamada won, and prompted Matsumoto to leave with him. Matsumoto was unsure of what to do, but started walking in the same direction as Hamada because it was the opposite direction from It≈ç's house. This incident marked the beginning of Downtown.H≈çs≈ç-shitsu no Ura Published in 2003-7-26 by Wani Books. It≈ç talks about this incident in greater detail in this book. They were split apart when they entered different high schools. The boarding school Hamada entered was very strict, and Hamada attempted to escape several times. Whenever he escaped successfully, he called Matsumoto for help, hiding at his home for several days before being caught by his teachers. Hamada repeated the cycle of escaping, calling Matsumoto to borrow money to buy food, and being caught again, throughout his high school years. Matsumoto, on the other hand, entered a local tech school, and became the leader of the school band, but quickly started skipping school to hang out with his girlfriend from middle school. = Early career = A VHS from 1988 After graduating, Hamada had an unsuccessful try at becoming a motorboat racer. Hamada invited Matsumoto to join him to become a comedian. At the time, Matsumoto had a job offer from local publishing company, but he decided to join Hamada. Although Matsumoto's comedy talent agency of choice was Sh≈çchicku Gein≈ç, the two went with Hamada's choice and entered Yoshimoto Kogyo: NSC (New Star Creation) in Osaka.LINCOLN Episode #58, 2007-01-16. Their first stage name was \\"Matsumoto Hamada\\". Other names they had were \\"Hitoshi Masashi\\", \\"Teruo-Haruo\\", and The \\"Wright Brothers\\", before settling as \\"Downtown\\", a name they picked from a magazine. They made their major debut in 1983. Matsumoto and Hamada received positive comments from older comedians in NSC, but went without a single chuckle from the audience, sometimes receiving insults from hecklers.Downtown no Riy≈´ Article #20 Published 1995-10-09. They organized performances of their sketches and routines by themselves, but could not get people to listen, even if tickets were free. Matsumoto describes these early years as hell, showing his immense frustration and stress during this period. They even considered quitting at one point.Downtown no Riy≈´ Article #21 Published 1995-10-23. Neither made enough money to live on their own, so they had to live with their parents, commuting to the city by train for performance opportunities. Ironically, Matsumoto had to search for a part-time job in a magazine printed by the printing company that he had originally been supposed to enter after graduating high school. = Rise to popularity = Despite the hardships, they gradually increased their fan-base and status. In April 1987 (four years after their debut) they began hosting a local television show called Yoji Desu Y≈çda (\\"It's Four O'Clock\\"), which immediately raised them to idol-like popularity in the region (music singles, videos and photo books in which they posed like fashion models were released), especially among high school girls. After a tearful farewell concert, they ended the show and moved to Tokyo in 1989, making various appearances on low rating TV programs before making their big break with their long-running variety show Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!. From that point, they went on to create several other successful variety shows, such as Downtown no Gottsu Ee Kanji, Downtown DX and the music-centric Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ.  Comedy style  Hamada about to hit Matsumoto on the head on Downtown DX = Boke and tsukkomi = As with many Japanese comedy duos, there exists a boke and a tsukkomi. Matsumoto is the boke of the two and often puts up with light physical abuse (it is common for the tsukkomi to slap the boke on top of his head whenever he says something rude or ridiculous) from Hamada, the tsukkomi. Hamada is also known to attack other tarento and celebrities when they give boke-like responses to Downtown's questions. In a very recent skit where Downtown and the other Gaki members were presented with the autonomous robot Pepper Hamada even slapped the robot on its head. Hamada's aggressive ways have earned him the nickname of , or \\"Hamada the Super Sadist.\\" But occasionally, they switch their roles as a skit about Hamada being immortal, had Hamada in the Boke and Matsumoto in the Tsukkomi role. With Hamada telling stories about how he survived several accidents which would have put any other in the hospital and with Matsumoto addressing the audience in a very dry tone \\"Aho ya.\\" (What an idiot) = Manzai = The early 1980s prominently featured quick, snappy styles of manzai, but Downtown took the opposite approach, using a slow, mumbling tone which baffled older comedians. While other duos performed manzai facing the audience, Downtown would face each other as if they were simply conversing, ignoring the presence of the audience. Their contribution to manzai is immeasurable; it has been remarked that manzai will never be the same after Downtown, and many aspiring comedians have copied parts of Downtown's style. It is notable that Downtown never had a mentor (it was common for younger comedians to be \\"trained\\" by older, more experienced comedians) which was essential to the development of their own, unorthodox style. In the group's early years, many recognized Downtown's talent, but doubted Downtown would ever succeed due to their sluggish style, which was so drastically different from that of mainstream manzai. Shinsuke Shimada, a leading manzai comedian, had been one of the doubters until he saw one of Downtown's performances. Shimada was startled by how funny and complex Downtown was, and immediately announced his retirement from manzai. In his press conference, Shimada cited Downtown as the major reason for his retirement, but the press ignored the comment, since the duo had very little popularity at the time, writing instead that Shimada had felt outclassed by a different manzai duo; Saburo-Shiro. Shimada's decision proved to be correct however, as Downtown dominated manzai in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Downtown and Shimada have developed a close bond over the years, and Matsumoto co-hosts a TV talk show (\\"Matsushin\\") with Shimada. Performing ad-libbed manzai on Gaki no Tsukai Though Matsumoto and Hamada are now regarded as \\"geniuses\\" of their respective roles, it is unjust to laud them only for their talent. Matsumoto made a change from being a quieter character to his current, ill-tempered style, while Hamada had to repeatedly apologize for brash comments in variety shows. Upon hearing that many fans regarded Hamada as the crux of the group, Matsumoto embarked upon an array of solo skits to prove himself, while Hamada relentlessly studied other groups' tsukkomi to improve upon his own skills. Another important aspect of Downtown's comedy is their willingness to make themselves the butt of the joke. While many popular manzai comedians become elevated to the level where poking fun at them is out of the question, Downtown has always taken ridiculous roles in shows, even after becoming popular. This is particularly evident in Gaki No Tsukai where they endure countless physical and mental punishments, such as their punishment games. Generally, these roles are reserved for younger, less popular comedians, but Matsumoto and Hamada relish these roles even after becoming part of the elite of Japanese entertainment. Downtown has not performed a manzai routine since 1991, though the free talk session on Gaki No Tsukai can be considered the final form of Downtown's manzai. = Kansai dialect = Yoshimoto K≈çgy≈ç is very much a Kansai operation, although it is not limited to people from Osaka and its surroundings. Most of its comedians speak Kansai- ben, the strong, earthy dialect that developed among the merchant classes of Osaka, as opposed to the more elegant tones of Kyoto or the standard language of the Edo (now Tokyo) aristocracy. Matsumoto and Hamada have never lost the dialect and have used it to their benefit. They use it in the titles of their TV shows‚Äîtranslations of Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende (\\"Not An Errand Boy!\\"‚Äî\\"Gaki no Tsukai dewa Naiyo!\\" in standard Japanese) or Gottsu Ee Kanji cannot be found in a standard dictionary. Downtown's popularity have turned these expressions into common vocabulary.  Private relationship  Although they appear to be best friends on their shows, Hamada and Matsumoto admit they are not as close as one may think. On their many hosted shows and interviews, the two have made the following revelations: * In a 1990 interview, Hamada and Matsumoto revealed that they had gone through very tense moments, and that their second year as a comedy duo saw their relationship at its worst. They revealed that during that period, just before they were scheduled to perform at the Umeda Hall in Osaka on New Year's Eve, the two had an argument which devolved into a violent fight, but when their turn to perform arrived, they went up to the stage and performed their act as if nothing had happened. * They do not know each other's cell phone numbers, as they see no need to phone one another. Matsumoto has phoned Hamada's cell phone just once: when Hamada fractured his right leg (after kicking a locker out of rage) and was taken to a hospital. He had to ask a staff member for his number.A Downtown no Gottsu Ee Kanji incident. The moment Matsumoto phoned Hamada was filmed and shown on the show. For weeks afterwards, Hamada appeared on television with a cast and crutches. * They do not travel together, even going as far as arranging for one to travel by plane and another by train to avoid meeting by chance. * They find it extremely awkward and uncomfortable being left alone together in a room. As was showcased during the \\"500 questions for Hamada Masatoshi\\" segment showed. Matsumoto won the challenge and sat there in awkward silence as Hamada offered him a drink. * After Hamada's marriage, Matsumoto has never been to his residence. * Matsumoto has only seen Hamada's son once, when he was still an infant.Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!, „ÇØ„Ç§„Ç∫ÊµúÁî∞„ÅÆ500„ÅÆ„Ç≥„Éà Aired on 2007-04-01. * By pure coincidence, they once vacationed in Guam at the same time. When Matsumoto saw Hamada, he avoided him. When later asked by Hamada why he did not say anything, he replied that it would have been \\"too awkward\\".Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!! The two talked about this during the talk segment on this show. * Matsumoto has said that even if they quit Downtown, they likely would not be able to return to being friends.Downtown no Riy≈´, article #19, 1997-9-22. On Music Champ, Matsumoto stated they see each other so often at work, the thought of meeting in private never crosses their mind. During an interview with PUFFY, he was impressed by how the two singers spend time together as friends despite having to work together all the time as a duo‚Äîhe turned to Hamada and told him, \\"I'd rather eat off the floor than go out to dinner with you.\\" This does not mean, however, they do not get along outside of work. Though they do not consider each other to be friends, their deep business relationship and respect for each other is evident. Hamada has said if they ever parted ways, he would \\"never do comedy again,\\"Downtown no Riy≈´ Article #7 (Interview with Hamada), Published 1997-3-14. as there is no one else he would like to make his partner, Matsumoto has expressed similar views.Downtown no Riy≈´ Article #18 Published 1997-9-18. Hamada: \\"Who else is there for me? I can't do owarai with someone else.\\" Matsumoto: \\"It wouldn't be fun doing it with anyone else.\\" He has also said he saves his best tsukkomi material for Matsumoto.Downtown no Riy≈´ Article #19 Published 1997-9-22. Tanaka of Cocorico reports seeing Matsumoto become visibly concerned whenever Hamada is sick and unable to come to work. Matsumoto has said that if the duo ever split up, they would like to perform their manzai one last time at Namba Grand Kagetsu, Yoshimoto Kogyo's theatre in Osaka and the very stage on which Downtown launched their career.

The section between Harrisonville (at a junction with Interstate 49/U.S. Route 71) and Clinton (at a junction with Route 13) provides an important link for traffic between Springfield and Kansas City. Route description The route begins at Interstate 44, exit 150, as a two-lane highway. It then heads northwest into Richland, intersecting with Route 133. From there, it continues northwest to a concurrency with Route 5, starting three miles south of Camdenton. In Camdenton, it crosses U.S. 54, and continues northwest, crossing the Lake of the Ozarks. After crossing the lake, Route 5 diverges north, and Route 7 heads west to another concurrency with US 65. The combined route crosses Harry S. Truman Reservoir and the Osage River and then enters Warsaw, where the concurrency ends; Route 7 heads west and crosses more arms of the Truman Reservoir. At Clinton, it intersects Route 13 and Route 52, and then becomes a four-lane highway, running northwest to Interstate 49/US 71 in Harrisonville. After a brief concurrency with I-49/U.S. 71, Route 7 heads north as a two-lane highway, crossing Route 58 in Pleasant Hill, Route 150, and US 50. In Blue Springs, it crosses US 40 and I-70. Continuing north, Route 7 is the eastern terminus of Route 78, before itself terminating at US 24 in Independence. History Missouri Route 7 links the Kansas City area to the Ozarks, however it was not always called Route 7. Starting in 1926-27 it connected US 71 to US 50 only, by 1937 it had been extended to US 40. The section that runs east from US 71 - US 65 (1935), to US 54, and later on to US 66 (1953)was once called State Route 35. This was changed to Route 7 in 1959. In the early 1970s with the creation of Truman Lake, the Osage River Bridge was bypassed with a new mile long span. http://www.modot.org/historicmaps/ Major intersections References 007 Category:Transportation in Pulaski County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Camden County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Benton County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Henry County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Cass County, Missouri Category:Transportation in Jackson County, Missouri ","title":"Missouri Route 7"},{"id":"2154153","text":"The Sakarya (; ; Latin: Sangarius) is the third longest river in Turkey. It runs through the region known in ancient times as Phrygia. It was considered one of the principal rivers of Asia Minor (Anatolia) in classical antiquity, and is mentioned in the Iliad and in Theogony.Hesiod, Theogony, 344. Its name appears in different forms as Sagraphos,Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. 2.724. Sangaris,Constantine VII, De Administrando Imperio 1.5 or Sagaris.Ovid, ex Pont. 4.10 17; Solin 43; Map of the Sakarya River In Geographica, Strabo wrote that during classical antiquity, the river had its sources on Mount Adoreus, near the town of Sangia in Phrygia, not far from the Galatian frontier, and flowed in a very tortuous course, first in an eastern, then in a northern, then in a northwestern, and lastly again in a northern direction through Bithynia into the Euxine (Black Sea). In one part of its course it formed the boundary between Phrygia and Bithynia; and in early times Bithynia was bounded on the east by the river. The Bithynian part of the river was navigable, and was celebrated for the abundance of fish found in it. Its principal tributaries were the Alander, Bathys, Thymbres, and Gallus.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, p. 34; Apollon. 2.724; Scymnus. 234, foil.; Strab. xii. pp. 563, 567; Dionys. Perieg. 811; Ptol. 5.1.6; Steph. B. sub voce Liv. 38.18; Plin. Nat. 5.43; Amm. Marc. 22.9. The source of the river is the Bayat Yaylasƒ± (Bayat Plateau) which is located to the northeast of Afyon. Joined by the Porsuk √áayƒ± (Porsuk Creek) close to the town of Polatlƒ±, the river runs through the Adapazarƒ± Ovasƒ± (Adapazarƒ± Plains) before reaching the Black Sea. The Sakarya was once crossed by the Sangarius Bridge, constructed by the East Roman Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). Sangarius Bridge constructed by Justinian the Great (r. 527‚Äì565) In the 13th century, the valley of the Sakarya was part of the frontier between the Byzantine Empire and the home of the S√∂ƒü√ºt tribe. By 1280, Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII had constructed a series of fortifications along the river to control the area, but a flood in 1302 changed the course of the river and made the fortifications useless. The S√∂ƒü√ºt tribe migrated across the river and went on to establish the Ottoman Empire. From downstream to upstream, the Sakarya has four dams: Ak√ßay, Yenice, G√∂k√ßekaya and Sarƒ±yar.

Drewsey is along the main stem of the Malheur River, about east of Burns, off U.S. Route 20. It has the ZIP Code of 97904. History The region around Drewsey was frequented by Paiute tribes long before white settlers arrived. They caught salmon in the river and its tributaries and hunted and foraged on the land. Subsequent clashes between the two cultures led to creation of the Malheur Indian Reservation, which included the Drewsey area, in 1872. There the Paiutes and others were expected to learn about white culture and to become farmers. After further clashes, the Indians were re- located from the Malheur region to reservations elsewhere in the West. By the early 1880s, settlers began establishing themselves in and around Drewsey. Abner Robbins opened a store here in 1883 and named the place \\"Gouge Eye\\" to commemorate a local dispute. When Robbins applied for a post office, postal authorities did not accept the original name, so he changed it to \\"Drusy\\". When the office was established in 1884, however, it was registered under the name \\"Drewsey\\". Drewsey grew rapidly in the late 19th century, depending on farming and ranching for its economic base. The Pacific Livestock Company, two lumbers mills, and other businesses thrived here through the 1920s. However, bypassed by the nearest east‚àíwest railway as well as the main highway, Drewsey lost population during the Great Depression and after. In the 21st century, Drewsey consists of a small number of homes, a combined garage and store with a post office, a tavern and restaurant, two churches, and an elementary school. Geography =Climate= Drewsey has a steppe climate (K√∂ppen Csb). =Time Zones= Although Drewsey is officially in the Pacific Time Zone. Some residents choose to unofficially observe the Mountain Time Zone due to close proximity to Malheur County. Despite this, Pacific Time is strictly adhered to by businesses and the Oregon Department of Transportation Education Buildings in Drewsey Drewsey Elementary School is in Drewsey. It serves children in kindergarten through grade 8. Infrastructure =Transportation= In the 21st century, Drewsey is a stop on the Eastern Public Oregon Intercity Transit (POINT) bus line between Bend and Ontario. It makes one stop per day in each direction. Two roads for cars and trucks lead to the community. Drewsey Road links Drewsey to Route 20, to the south. Drewsey Market Road connects to rural locations to the west along the Malheur River.

The film was a West German/American co-production, shot mainly at the Bavaria studios. Loosely based on a 1971 novel, Viper Three by Walter Wager, it tells the story of Lawrence Dell, a renegade USAF general who escapes from a military prison and takes over an ICBM silo in Montana, threatening to launch the missiles and start World War III unless the President reveals a top secret document to the American people about the Vietnam War. A split screen technique is used at several points in the movie to give the audience insight into the simultaneously occurring strands of the storyline. The film's title, which functions on several levels, is taken from \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", the national anthem of the United States: :O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, / What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Plot After escaping from a military prison, rogue Air Force General Lawrence Dell and accomplices Powell, Garvas, and Hoxey infiltrate a Montana ICBM complex that Dell helped design. Their goal is to gain control over its nine Titan nuclear missiles. The infiltration does not go as planned, as the impulsive Hoxey guns down an Air Force guard for trying to answer a ringing phone. Dell then shoots and kills Hoxey. The three then make direct contact with the US government (avoiding any media attention) and demand a $10 million ransom and that the President go on national television and make public the contents of a top-secret document. The document, which is unknown to the current president but not to certain members of his cabinet, contains conclusive proof that the US government knew there was no realistic hope of winning the Vietnam War but continued fighting for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the Soviet Union their unwavering commitment to defeating Communism. Meanwhile, Dell and his two remaining men remove the security countermeasures to the launch control system and gain full control over the complex. While the President and his Cabinet debate the practical, personal, and ethical aspects of agreeing to the demands, they also authorize the military to send an elite team led by General MacKenzie to penetrate the ICBM complex and incinerate its command center with a low-yield tactical nuclear device. Just as the device is about to be set, the commando team accidentally trips an alarm, alerting Dell to their operation. A furious Dell responds by initiating the launch sequence for all nine missiles. As the military and President Stevens watch the underground missile silo launch covers begin to open, they agree to call off the attempt and the launch is aborted with mere seconds to spare. During this time, the captive Air Force guards attempt to overpower Dell and his men, resulting in the death of Garvas and another guard. Eventually, the President agrees to meet the demands, which include allowing himself to be taken hostage and used as a human shield while Dell and Powell make their escape from the complex. As the president leaves the White House, he asks the Secretary of Defense to release the document should he be killed in the process. US Air Force snipers take aim and shoot both Dell and Powell, but also accidentally shoot the President, who with his dying breath asks the Secretary of Defense if he will release the document. The Secretary cannot bring himself to answer. Cast * Burt Lancaster as Gen. Lawrence Dell * Richard Widmark as Gen.

Lorimar were known for making TV series like The Waltons and Eight is Enough and TV movies like Sybil and Helter Skelter. They wanted to move in feature film production and Twilight's Last Gleaming - as it would be known - would be their first.FILM CLIPS: Sci-Fi in De Palma's Future Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 15 Aug 1977: e8. According to Aldrich, Lorimar \\"couldn't get it [a film of the novel] financed. Every actor in town had seen it - including Burt Lancaster... If you hadn't already seen it, you were going to see it. Or you knew one or two pictures that were kind of like it... There was no social impact. The kidnappers had no interesting motivation. The reasons they wanted to get the President weren't even PLO-type reasons. They just wanted the money. That didn't seem to me to make much sense.\\"\\"I CAN'T GET JIMMY CARTER TO SEE MY MOVIE!\\" Aldrich, Robert. Film Comment; New York Vol. 13, Iss. 2, (Mar/Apr 1977): 46-52. Lorimar took the project to Aldrich, who said he \\"wondered what would happen if you had an Ellsberg mentality, if you had some command officer who came out of Vietnam and who was soured not by war protestors but by the misuse of the military... What would happen if you had a general who was angry at the political use of the armed forces? \\" Aldrich told Lorimar he would do the film \\"if I could turn that story upside down.\\" Aldrich pitched his take on the material to Burt Lancaster who agreed to do the film. Lancaster called the film \\"All the President's Men Part Two... a very powerful political piece couched in highly melodramatic terms.\\"A Bittersweet Burt Lancaster, Looking Back-and Forward--at 62: A Bittersweet Burt Lancaster By Kenneth Turan.

HOLLIE New York Times 8 Mar 1980: 27 Merv Adelson, head of Lorimar, described the movie as \\"the perfect formula picture... an action- adventure picture that appeals to the international market.

Have all our money back before it opens domestically.\\"Small Movie Companies Gamble for 'One Big Hit': $50 Million Tied Up Depend on Distributors Different Kinds of Movies Fears for the Future By ALJEAN HARMETZ New York Times 21 Mar 1981: 11. Adelson would later become disillusioned with this formula because the films did not achieve much critical acclaim, and if they did not perform domestically Lorimar did not make that much money out of them. =Casting= Lancaster and Aldrich thought the President could be a John F. Kennedy type. Lancaster approached Paul Newman to play the role, but he was not enthusiastic. So, Aldrich reconfigured the character as a Mayor Daley type politician. =Script= The writers Ronald M. Cohen and Edward Huebsch wrote the script together over six weeks. Aldrich called it \\"the most unlikely marriage in the world. Huebsch's a little wizened old man, sixty-two, sixty-three years old, been in the political wars for forty years, probably the most knowledgeable political analyst in town - or at least up there with Abe Polonsky and Ring Lardner. And Cohen is a loud- mouthed, extroverted, young, smart-ass guy who knows that he votes Democratic... an extraordinarily gifted writer in terms of what people say and how they say it. The script was originally 350 pages. \\"If that movie's anti- American so is Jimmy Carter,\\" said Aldrich. \\"The most inflammatory statement in the movie is that it opts for open government.\\"A Touch of Garbo for 'Fedora' Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 28 Mar 1977: e7. =Split Screen= Aldrich decided to use split screen and multiple panels. \\"I don't particularly like panels unless they're in a bread commercial. But I thought they fitted that particular movie. They cost me an extra half a year - half a year. But you couldn't tell that story in less than three hours without them.\\" Aldrich normally used Joseph Biroc as cinematographer but Biroc's wife fell ill before shooting so Aldrich used Robert Hauser. =Filming= Filming took place in Munich in August 1976. Several scenes were shot with Vera Miles as the president's wife but were cut to save time. Aldrich said he hoped the audience came to realise that the Lancaster character was crazy. \\"But I don't think we did it. The audience is so much for those guys getting away with it.\\" He also did not feel it was ambiguous enough at the end as to whether the shooting of the president was intentional.  Release  The film did poorly at the box office. In France it recorded admissions of 88,945.French box office results for Robert Aldrich films at Box Office Story It was unsuited for videocassettes, because the split-screen effects do not work well in low resolution of that format. After the rights reverted to the film's German co- producers, a major remastering effort was done by Bavaria Media, who released a Blu-ray edition, distributed in the United States by Olive Films in 2012.

It is located at the southwest corner of Wellington Road and Bradley Avenue, just north of Highway 401. Location White Oaks is located in South London, adjacent to the arterial street Wellington Road. It is serviced by the following bus routes operated by the London Transit Commission, two terminals at Jalna Boulevard which provide bus routes 4A, 4B and 93 and 4 terminals at the Wellington Road entrance which provide bus routes 10, 13, 13A, 28, 30 and 90. The mall is expected to be the southern terminus of one route on the planned London Rapid Transit system. History =Beginnings= The property on which the mall is now located was originally occupied by a small outdoor plaza, built in 1962, before major development began in the surrounding neighborhoods. In 1972, the plaza was completely rebuilt to make way for expansion. It became a fully enclosed shopping center in 1973, anchored by Woolco in addition to 150+ stores. =Expansions= The mall's first major expansion in 1976 brought in a Simpson's department store, after a major renovation to the old Savette. A long hall of stores that deviated west from the original race-track lay-out was also added at that time. The mall saw rapid growth in the 1980s as it competed with other shopping centers in London. Over a period of half a decade, the mall saw no fewer than three major expansions. The first occurring in 1983 with a Mark's and Spencer's, a food court which replaced the Loblaw's grocery store, and several other new stores. Almost immediately after a brand new wing began construction and opened in 1986. Over 50 more stores were added in 1988 with the most recent major expansion. =Today= White Oaks saw a small expansion in 2006 which brought in Swedish retailer H&M; along with an Applebee's Neighborhood Grill and Bar. In 2010 CPP Investment Board became the sole owner of the mall, until the property, along with two other regional malls, was acquired by Bentall Kennedy in 2013. Since Bentall Kennedy's ownership, the mall has seen further renovation, including decorative pieces. There are over 185 stores and services in the mall. Shops in White Oaks Mall Walmart in White Oaks Mall Criticisms The mall has received some criticism in recent years for forcing out independent stores. This included the gift-shop Durga, which had been a tenant with the mall for 26 years.https://lfpress.com/news/london/2011/01/21/16983031.html Similarly, Logo Sports was also denied a lease renewal in 2014 after 25 years at the mall.

It is located near the geographic center of the Quad Cities. The bridge was designed by engineer Ralph Modjeski. The first span opened in 1935 as a toll bridge. In 1961, an identical twin span, built from the same blueprint, opened to facilitate increased traffic demands. Tolls were discontinued in 1970. The twin spans were merged with Interstate 74 in 1975. Built for a daily crossing of 48,000 vehicles, the daily average is 80,000, making it by far the most traveled bridge in the Quad Cities. Both the Interstate 80 and 280 bridges are up to Interstate standards, while the Interstate 74 Bridge is functionally obsolete and was not built to Interstate standards, as it has two narrow lanes, no shoulder, and a 50 mile-per-hour (80 km/h) speed limit. I-74 bridge replacement Construction of the new span in 2019. Arist rendering of the new bridge. The I-74 Corridor Study was completed to study replacing the bridge with a larger one with 4 lanes in each direction. The study claimed that the I-74 Bridge project would spur economic growth, create construction jobs, reduce traffic backups, and improve air quality. Funding for the construction of the new bridge has been earmarked for $22 million in 2017 and $50 million in 2018. Former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn said the state is committed to bridge improvements to help traffic flow and \\"boost economic growth in the region\\". As of 2012, the Illinois Department of Transportation also budgeted more than $34 million for engineering, design and land acquisition for the new bridge. The conceptual design of the arch bridge was completed by CH2M Hill and Boston-based bridge designer Miguel Rosales from Rosales + Partners. Final design was completed by Modjeski and Masters in association with Alfred Benesch & Company. The portion of the bridge spanning the Mississippi River is estimated at more than $700 million, while the project as a whole, including all approach routes and connectors, is estimated at $1.2 billion. While on a tour at the base of the bridge in Bettendorf in May 2012, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said that, in comparison with other bridges that he has seen in other states, the current I-74 Bridge is one of the worst he's seen.Funding Back For I-74 Bridge - KWQC-TV6 News and Weather For The Quad Cities The new bridge will be just upstream of the existing bridge and will be a basket-handle, true-arch twin bridge with four lanes in each direction and a pedestrian/bicycle path. A ground-breaking ceremony for the new bridge was held on June 26, 2017. The westbound bridge is expected to be completed in late 2019 and the eastbound span is expected to be completed in late 2020. The existing I-74 bridge is anticipated to be removed in 2021. Winter weather conditions and the resulting high water over an extended period of time, however, have created delays and the opening of the first span has been pushed to the first half of 2020.

An equivalent term to this definition would be Reptiliomorpha. Anthracosauria has also been used to refer to a smaller group of large, crocodilian-like aquatic tetrapods also known as embolomeres. Various definitions Pteroplax, an embolomere As originally defined by S√§ve-S√∂derbergh in 1934, the anthracosaurs are a group of usually large aquatic Amphibia from the Carboniferous and lower Permian. As defined by Alfred Sherwood Romer however, the anthracosaurs include all non-amniote \\"labyrinthodont\\" reptile-like amphibians, and S√§ve-S√∂derbergh's definition is more equivalent to Romer's suborder Embolomeri. This definition was also used by Edwin H. Colbert and Robert L. Carroll in their textbooks of Vertebrate Palaeontology (Colbert 1969, Carroll 1988). Dr A. L. Panchen however preferred S√§ve-S√∂derbergh's original definition of Antracosauria in his Handbuch der Pal√§oherpetologie, 1970. With cladistics things have changed again. Gauthier, Kluge and Rowe (1988) defined Anthracosauria as a clade including \\"Amniota plus all other tetrapods that are more closely related to amniotes than they are to amphibians\\" (Amphibia in turn was defined by these authors as a clade including Lissamphibia and those tetrapods that are more closely related to lissamphibians than they are to amniotes). Similarly, Michel Laurin (1996) uses the term in a cladistic sense to refer to only the most advanced reptile- like amphibians. Thus his definition includes Diadectomorpha, Solenodonsauridae and the amniotes. As Ruta, Coates and Quicke (2003) pointed out, this definition is problematic, because, depending on the exact phylogenetic position of Lissamphibia within Tetrapoda, using it might lead to the situation where some taxa traditionally classified as anthracosaurs, including even the genus Anthracosaurus itself, wouldn't belong to Anthracosauria. Laurin (2001) created a different phylogenetic definition of Anthracosauria, defining it as \\"the largest clade that includes Anthracosaurus russelli but not Ascaphus truei\\". However, Michael Benton (2000, 2004) makes the anthracosaurs a paraphyletic order within the superorder Reptiliomorpha, along with the orders Seymouriamorpha and Diadectomorpha, thus making the Anthracosaurians the \\"lower\\" reptile-like amphibians. In his definition, the group encompass the Embolomeri, Chroniosuchia and possibly the family Gephyrostegidae. Etymology The name \\"Anthracosauria\\" is Greek ('coal lizards'), because many of its fossils were found in the Coal Measures. References and external links  * Benton, M. J.

Soloway identifies as nonbinary and gender non-conforming, using gender-neutral singular they pronouns. On June 26, 2020, Soloway announced a preference to be referred to as Joey rather than Jill. Early life Soloway was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, to public relations consultant, coach and writer, Elaine Soloway, and psychiatrist Dr. Harry J. Soloway, who grew up in London. Around 2011, Dr. Soloway came out as transgender. Soloway's elder sister, Faith, is a Boston- based musician and performer with whom Joey sometimes collaborates. Both Joey and Faith attended Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago. Joey Soloway graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison as a communications arts major. Soloway's mother was formerly a press aide to Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne and was a former communications director for School Superintendent Ruth Love. After 30 years, Soloway's parents divorced. Soloway has a stepfather named Tommy Madison. Career While at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Soloway was a film and television student of JJ Murphy and participated in the creation of an undergraduate experimental narrative film entitled Ring of Fire as the assistant director under director Anita Katzman. After college Soloway worked as a production assistant in commercials and music videos in Chicago, as well as at Kartemquin Films on the movie Hoop Dreams. While in Chicago, Joey and Faith co-developed a parody of The Brady Bunch for live stage called The Real Live Brady Bunch, which began their professional theatrical writing and directing endeavors. They also sold a pilot script to HBO called Jewess Jones about a female superhero. Also at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago, the pair created plays The Miss Vagina Pageant, and later, while in Los Angeles, Not Without My Nipples. With Maggie Rowe, Soloway co-created Hollywood Hellhouse and Sit n' Spin. =Television= Soloway‚Äôs TV writing career began on shows such as The Oblongs, Nikki and The Steve Harvey Show. Soloway followed those shows by writing for four seasons on the HBO original series Six Feet Under, ultimately serving as co-executive producer. Six Feet Under ran for five seasons from 2001 to 2005. Soloway received 3 Emmy nominations in 2002, 2003 and 2005 for Outstanding Drama Series. Soloway's short story, Courteney Cox's Asshole, caught the attention of Alan Ball and led to the job. Soloway later wrote episodes of Dirty Sexy Money, Grey's Anatomy, and Tell Me You Love Me and was executive producer/showrunner for the second season of Showtime's United States of Tara, created by Diablo Cody, as well as HBO's How to Make it in America, created by Ian Edelman. In August 2016, Amazon premiered a Soloway-directed pilot of I Love Dick, based on the novel by the same name by Chris Kraus. It was later picked up for a full season, which premiered on May 12, 2017. Transparent Soloway created the pilot Transparent for Amazon.com, which became available for streaming and download on February 6, 2014, and was part of Amazon's second pilot season. Joey and Faith Soloway collaborated, including serving as co-writers on Transparent. They were inspired by their parent who came out as transgender. The show stars Gaby Hoffmann, Jay Duplass, and Amy Landecker as siblings whose parent (played by Jeffrey Tambor) reveals she is going through a significant life transition. The pilot for Transparent was picked up by Amazon Studios. As part of the making of the show, Soloway enacted a \\"transfirmative action program\\", whereby transgender applicants were hired in preference to non-transgender ones. , over eighty transgender people have worked on the show, including two transgender consultants. Soloway wrote Hoffmann's role on Transparent especially for Hoffmann after seeing her performance on Louie. Transparent premiered all ten episodes simultaneously in late September 2014. The show wrapped its fourth season in 2017, and concluded with a movie finale in 2019. Soloway received two Primetime Emmys for Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series in 2014 and 2016 for Transparent and the show has received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series. =Film= Soloway's first film was a 13-minute short titled Una Hora Por Favora, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2012. The film stars Michaela Watkins and Wilmer Valderrama. The film tells the story of a woman (Watkins) who hires a day laborer (Valderrama) to do some handy work at her home, but her relationship soon goes beyond professional. Soloway‚Äôs debut at Sundance, Afternoon Delight (2013) won the Directing Award. The film follows Rachel (Kathryn Hahn), a thirty- something woman who is struggling to rekindle her relationship with her husband (Josh Radnor), and ultimately befriends an exotic dancer (Juno Temple). In an interview by IndieWire, Soloway had a personal connection to the film's central character, explaining \\"There‚Äôs a lot of me in Rachel‚Äôs journey. I‚Äôve never brought a stripper home, but I‚Äôve always loved reading the memoirs of strippers and sex workers. I feel like they‚Äôre the war reporters for women. They go to the front lines of a very particular kind of extreme conflict and live there, then write about it so we can experience it with them.\\" Afternoon Delight played at national and international film festivals and was nominated for multiple awards, including a Gotham Award for Breakthrough Performance for Kathryn Hahn, and a Spirit Award for First Feature. In June 2019, Soloway signed on to write, direct and produce the Red Sonja remake. =Writing= Soloway wrote the novella Jodi K., which was published in the collection Three Kinds of Asking For It: Erotic Novellas, edited by Susie Bright. Soloway's memoir, Tiny Ladies in Shiny Pants: Based on a True Story, was released in hardcover in 2005, and then in paperback in 2006. In 2018, Soloway published another book, She Wants It: Desire, Power and Toppling the Patriarchy, with Ebury Press, a division of Penguin Random House. Jewish religion and culture, sexuality, and gender are recurring themes in Soloway's show, Transparent. According to Soloway, \\"The Transparent narrative is not, then, just or even mostly about transition and transgender. It‚Äôs about big themes like familial secrets and transformation, revelation and change, all of which are rendered through the specificity and magic of television images and sounds, which create imaginative worlds.\\" Besides exploring the themes around transitioning and having a transgender parent, Soloway incorporates the female gaze often. In September 2016, Soloway delivered a speech at the Toronto International Film Festival and discussed the concept of the female gaze. Soloway divided the female gaze into three parts: reclaiming the female body, engaging the gaze, and returning the gaze. Soloway includes the female gaze in an attempt to show the viewers what women would feel, see, and experience when they were being watched by the opposite sex. Soloway explained that storytelling about the female gaze was a ‚Äúconscious effort to create empathy as a political tool‚Äù For example, in the television show titled I Love Dick, Soloway said that this show was really about ‚Äúthe female voice...and creating protagonism for women.‚Äù. According to an article by Madeline Berg, the show portrays the male character as the object and ‚Äúused for a sexual end.‚Äù Soloway's writing is often about \\"The Heroine's Journey,\\" which is about \\"repairing the divided feminine: the wife and the other woman confronting each other--mom, stripper. That I think women's journeys are really about repairing these sort of divided parts of ourselves. And this divide in our culture that I think is responsible for so much that is a problem in our culture.\\" Honors Soloway has seven Emmy nominations and two wins. Soloway is also a member of the board of the San Francisco Film Society. In 2015, Soloway's show Transparent won a Golden Globe for Best Series - Musical or Comedy. Later that same year, Soloway won a DGA Award and a Primetime Emmy Award for directing episode 1.08 (\\"Best New Girl\\") of the show. In 2016, Soloway won another Emmy for directing episode 2.09 (\\" Man on the Land\\") of Transparent. Also in 2016, Soloway was a finalist for The Advocate's Person of the Year, and was named to Oprah Winfrey's SuperSoul 100 list of visionaries and influential leaders. Personal life In 2011, Soloway married music supervisor Bruce Gilbert, with whom Soloway had been in a relationship since 2008. They have a son named Felix Soloway Gilbert. Soloway's older son, Isaac, is from a prior relationship with artist John Strozier. In 2015, Soloway announced being in the process of separating from Gilbert, and that Soloway was in a relationship with poet Eileen Myles, whom Soloway met through Transparent; their romantic relationship has since ended, and Myles and Soloway held an event at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, in which they \\"processed [their] relationship onstage.\\" Soloway lives in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. In Soloway‚Äôs memoir She Wants It, Soloway discusses accepting a nonbinary identity at age 50 after filming the first two seasons of Transparent. =Activism= Soloway is a strong supporter of feminism and co-founded the website Wifey.tv which is described as, \\"a curated video network for women\\" that includes content created by and for women. In an interview by Forbes, Soloway discusses the site saying, \\"I really like when our content appears to contradict itself at first glance. One day we might post something about sexism or the male gaze, then the next day post something that might be seen as precisely too sexy or raunchy, but it comes from a female creator or artist so it‚Äôs relevant. We love the conversation and don‚Äôt feel as dependent on insisting on a particular point of view.\\" Soloway also co-founded the East Side Jews collective, which is funded by the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. The collective \\"brings together 20- and 30-something Jews in Silver Lake and the surrounding neighborhoods of Los Angeles for offbeat, too-cool-for-shul events that tend to be heavy on comedy and light on Jewish ritual.\\" Soloway co-wrote The Thanksgiving Paris Manifesto with Eileen Myles in 2016, which is a feminist manifesto about the pornography industry. The manifesto was posted on topplethepatriarchy.com, a domain purchased by Myles and Soloway. The manifesto opens with, \\"We shouldn‚Äôt be starting with porn but we must. We support the idea of a porn industry and the idea of people making a living photographing and sharing images of sex but we don‚Äôt support an industry that exclusively distributes portrayals of almost exclusively male pleasure and climax.\\" Works or publications * Bright, Susie, Eric Albert, Greta Christina, and Jill Soloway. \\"Jodi K.\\" (novella) Susie Bright Presents: Three Kinds of Asking for It: Erotic Novellas, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005; * Soloway, Jill.

Union League Club of New York, established 1863. The Union Leagues were quasi-secretive men‚Äôs clubs established during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) to promote loyalty to the Union of the United States of America, the policies of newly elected 16th President Abraham Lincoln (1809‚Äì1865, served 1861‚Äì1865), and to combat what they believed to be the treasonous words and actions of anti-war, antiblack \\"Copperhead\\" Democrats. Though initially nonpartisan, by the war's last year they were in open alliance with the Republican Party, pro-Union Democrats, and the Union military. The most famous of these clubs were formed in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston and were composed of prosperous men who raised money for war- related service organizations, such as the United States Sanitary Commission, which provided medical care to treat Federal soldiers wounded in battle at a time when the military was ill-prepared for the scale of need. The clubs supported the Republican Party with funding, organizational support, and activism. Union Leagues also existed throughout the land which were created primarily by working-class men. By the spring of 1863, these disparate councils were organized under the Union League of America (ULA) organization which was headquartered in Washington DC. Like-minded organizations aimed at the working class, which became known as Loyal Leagues, were also created in New York. Similar patriotic organizations also existed for women and were known as Ladies Union Leagues. In December 1862, the Union League of Philadelphia was the first of the elite eastern Leagues to be established, though the first ULA council had formed in Pekin, Illinois in the summer of 1862. The famous Union League of Philadelphia building on Broad Street in center city Philadelphia, south of City Hall was built in 1865, and is designed in the Victorian style. It is still active, as are the Union League Clubs of New York and Chicago. Membership in the league is selective, and is comparable in social status to membership in a country club. Union League buildings often serve as private social clubs, with areas devoted to drinking establishments, meetings, lectures, libraries, dinners/banquets, speeches/addresses, socializing and relaxing, etc. Postwar During the Reconstruction era, Union Leagues were formed across the South after 1867 as working auxiliaries of the Republican Party, supported entirely by Northern interests. They were secret organizations that mobilized freedmen to register to vote and to vote Republican. They taught freedmen Union views on political issues and which way to vote on them, and promoted civic projects. Eric Foner reports: :By the end of 1867 it seemed that virtually every black voter in the South had enrolled in the Union League, the Loyal League, or some equivalent local political organization. Meetings were generally held in a black church or school.Eric Foner, \\"Black Reconstruction Leaders at the Grass Roots\\" in The Ku Klux Klan, a secret alliance of white supremacists that opposed civil rights and terrorized leaders of the African American community and African American voters, sometimes assassinated Union League leadership.Steven Hahn, A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South, from Slavery to the Great Migration (2003). pp 165-205 Philanthropic endeavors After the Civil War, members of the Union League Club of New York broadened their support of other philanthropic purposes. For instance, they helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art,John K. Howat, \\"Founding friends ‚Äì of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York\\", The Magazine Antiques, January 2000 issue. and funded construction of the Statue of Liberty's pedestalNational Park Service Statue of Liberty website . and Grant's Tomb.

Society =History= Kumukh historically was a fortress-city where the residence of the rulers of Lak people was. Kumukh is the ancient capital of Lakia. The history of the Laks can be divided into several parts. The first part is the era of Anushirwan, who appointed a ruler called Kumukh. In the 6th century Kumukh was one of the political centers in the highlands of Dagestan. The second part is the era of the shamkhals of Kumukh, who were first mentioned as the rulers of the Laks in the 8th century. In the 13th century the shamkhals of Kumukh accepted Islam and Lakia became an Islamic state. In the 15th century Kumukh became the main Islamic and political center of Dagestan. The third part is the era of the khans of Kumukh who opposed the colonial policy of Persia, Russia and Turkey. =Religion= Most Laks believe in Sunni Islam (Shafi'i school).–ü. –ò. –ü—É—á–∫–æ–≤. –†–ê–ó–î–ï–õ II. –†–û–°–°–ò–ô–°–ö–ò–ô –û–ü–´–¢. –°–û–í–†–ï–ú–ï–ù–ù–´–ï –†–ï–ê–õ–ò–ò, 2012. Sunni Islam encourages group solidarity; their members help each other find work and housing, arrange marriages, pay the kalim, maintain burial societies, resolve disputes, and so forth.

In this paper the groups that belong to Caucasionic race are those of western variant. These are the Ando-Tsunti people and the bulk of Avars, Laks, Dargin.

Green mountain with silver snow-capped peaks corresponds to the lands of Kulinsky district. Eagle symbolizes freedom and spiritual uplift of Laks. Gold chain is the national decoration. Golden field symbolizes the space filled with sunlight. The flag and the coat of arms of the Lakskiy District is of blue color which depicts the fortress, two daggers, an eagle and the crown. =Economy= Because the traditional Lak lands are mountainous and very dry, agriculture was of secondary importance in the traditional economy. In the mountainous regions, the economy was dominated by the raising of sheep and goats, and also some horses, cattle, and mules. Meat and milk products were major components of the Lak diet, although they also grew barley, peas, wheat and some potatoes. Most animal husbandry was the responsibility of males, whereas agriculture was mostly that of women. The Lak territory had no forests, and there was a chronic shortage of wood for building and fuel. Wheat and fruits and vegetables were grown in the lower areas, especially in the new Lak areas in northern Daghestan. The practice of transhumant sheepherding required that for several months each year, males moved to the lowlands to pasture their animals. Here they came into contact with different Daghestani peoples. Other Daghestani mountaineers grazed their sheep along with those of the Laks in the lands of the Kumyks. This is why most Lak males were multilingual. Many villages specialized in artisanry and crafts. Kumukh was famed for its jewelers and coppersmiths; Kaya was known for its merchants and markets; Unchukatl for saddle and harness makers; Ubra for masons and tinsmiths; Kuma for candy makers; Shovkra for shoe- and bootmakers; Tsovkra for acrobats; and Balkar for ceramics and jug makers. Lak women also engaged in cottage industries such as rug weaving, spinning, textile making, and ceramics, whereas the men engaged in leather working and tool making. Many of these traditions survived during the Soviet period because it was difficult to develop the Lak territories, which are isolated and have few resources. Textiles and clothing, leather working and shoe making, and the production of meat, cheese, and butter are still the dominant industries in this region. Many Laks continue to migrate (both permanently and seasonally) to other areas of Daghestan (and in particular to the cities) and to other surrounding areas to find employment. Whereas in the traditional pattern of transhumant animal husbandry, Lak males and their animals walked over the treacherous mountain passes and forded rivers, the herds are now taken by truck to their winter pastures in the lowlands and similarly brought back in the spring. Traditionally, extended families held the limited amount of agricultural land, the pastures, and the herds in common and did not have a strong sense of individual ownership. The Laks nevertheless resisted Soviet collectivization policies. =Kinship= Traditionally Laks, like most Daghestani highlanders, lived in patriarchal clan units (tukhums) consisting of a large extended family having a common ancestor, either recently deceased or still living. All members had the same patronymic and all property was owned mutually by the clan; decision making was the responsibility of either the elder patriarch or the elder males. Clan members were expected to provide mutual assistance in work and in family affairs, and to assume collective responsibility in vendettas, as prescribed by adat (traditional Daghestani customary law that predates Islam). The term for close family members within the tukhum is kk'ul, and they refer to each other as usursu (sibling). The importance of tukhums is today being eroded by modernization and continuing emigration. =Marriage= Marriages were traditionally arranged by the families of the couple, with the oldest women taking the most prominent role in the decision making. The bride and groom were most likely to be from the same clan. The custom of paying kal√Øm (bride-price) persists to a limited degree, but the transaction is more symbolic than financial. =Feudal system= The Laks are reported to have been the first Dagestani people to establish a feudal system. Their feudal society consisted of the khans; the bagtal (beks), who were the khan's family and the nobility; the chankri (children of marriages between beks and women of lower social orders); the uzdental (uzden), who were free peasants (numerically the largest of all classes); the rayat (serfs); and the laghart (slaves). This feudal system coexisted with a system of free societies, which were composed of the more democratic tukhums. These free societies were military and economic arrangements that were fluid in structure and worked on a democratic and voluntary basis. The laws governing the relations of groups within these free societies were codified in adat. =Language= The native language of all Laks is the Lak language. Lak is a member of the highly diverse Northeast Caucasian language family. Within the family, its position is highly debated, but it is generally thought to be an isolate, which either developed separately from an early point or, alternatively, a language of whose close relatives all have gone extinct.

They first appeared in the Permian period, 295‚Äì248 million years ago. They are often regarded as the most primitive of the hemipteroids. Their name originates from the Greek word œà·ø∂œáŒøœÇ, psokhos meaning gnawed or rubbed and œÄœÑŒµœÅŒ¨, ptera meaning wings. There are more than 5,500 species in 41 families in three suborders. Many of these species have only been described in recent years. They range in size from 1‚Äì10 millimeters (0.04‚Äì0.4 in) in length. The species known as booklice received their common name because they are commonly found amongst old books‚Äîthey feed upon the paste used in binding. The barklice are found on trees, feeding on algae and lichen. No member of this order is currently considered endangered; in fact, in 2007, Atlantopsocus adustus, a species native to Madeira and the Canary Islands, was found to have colonized the mild Cornish coast of southwest England.BBC News, \\"New insect species arrives in UK\\" 8 November 2007 In the 2000s, morphological and molecular evidence has shown that the parasitic lice (Phthiraptera) evolved from within the psocopteran suborder Troctomorpha. In modern systematics, Psocoptera and Phthiraptera are therefore treated together in the order Psocodea.Bess, Emilie, Vince Smith, Charles Lienhard, and Kevin P. Johnson (2006) Psocodea. Parasitic Lice (=Phthiraptera), Book Lice, and Bark Lice. Version 8 October 2006 (under construction). http://tolweb.org/Psocodea/8235/2006.10.08 in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/  Anatomy and biology  Psocids are small, scavenging insects with a relatively generalized body plan. They feed primarily on fungi, algae, lichen, and organic detritus in nature but are also known to feed on starch-based household items like grains, wallpaper glue and book bindings. They have chewing mandibles, and the central lobe of the maxilla is modified into a slender rod. This rod is used to brace the insect while it scrapes up detritus with its mandibles. They also have a swollen forehead, large compound eyes, and three ocelli. Their bodies are soft with a segmented abdomen. Some species can spin silk from glands in their mouth. They may festoon large sections of trunk and branches in dense swathes of silk. Some psocids have small ovipositors that are up to 1.5 times as long as the hindwings, and all four wings have a relatively simple venation pattern, with few cross-veins. The wings, if present, are held tent-like over the body. The legs are slender and adapted for jumping, rather than gripping, as in the true lice. The abdomen has nine segments, and no cerci. There is often considerable variation in the appearance of individuals within the same species. Many have no wings or ovipositors, and may have a different shape to the thorax. Other, more subtle, variations are also known, such as changes to the development of the setae. The significance of such changes is uncertain, but their function appears to be different from similar variations in, for example, aphids. Like aphids, however, many psocids are parthenogenic, and the presence of males may even vary between different races of the same species. Psocids lay their eggs in minute crevices or on foliage, although a few species are known to be viviparous. The young are born as miniature, wingless versions of the adult. These nymphs typically molt six times before reaching full adulthood. The total lifespan of a psocid is rarely more than a few months. Booklice range from approximately 1mm to 2mm in length (1/25\\" to 1/13\\"). Some species are wingless and they are easily mistaken for bedbug nymphs and vice versa. Booklouse eggs take 2 to 4 weeks to hatch and can reach adulthood approximately 2 months later. Adult booklice can live for six months. Besides damaging books, they also sometimes infest food storage areas, where they feed on dry, starchy materials. Although some psocids feed on starchy household products, the majority of psocids are woodland insects with little to no contact with humans, therefore they are of little economic importance. They are scavengers and do not bite humans.US Army Public Health Command fact sheet. http://phc.amedd.army.mil/PHC Resource Library/BookliceFSMar08WestFinal.pdf Psocids can affect the ecosystems in which they reside. Many psocids can affect decomposition by feeding on detritus, especially in environments with lower densities of predacious micro arthropods that may eat psocids. The nymph of a psocid species, Psilopsocus mimulus, is the first known wood-boring psocopteran. These nymphs make their own burrows in woody material, rather than inhabiting vacated, existing burrows. This boring activity can create habitats that other organisms may use.  Interaction with humans  Some species of psocids, such as Liposcelis bostrychophila, are common pests of stored products. Psocids, among other arthropods, have been studied to develop new pest control techniques in food manufacturing. One study found that modified atmospheres during packing (MAP) helped to control the reoccurrence of pests during the manufacturing process and prevented further infestation in the final products that go to consumers. Classification The order Psocoptera is divided into three suborders. =Suborder Trogiomorpha= Trogiomorpha have antennae with many segments (22‚Äì50 antennomeres) and always three-segmented tarsi. Trogiomorpha is the smallest suborder of the Psocoptera sensu stricto (i.e. excluding Phthiraptera), with about 340 species in 7 families, ranging from the monospecific fossil family Archaeotropidae to the speciose Lepidopsocidae (over 200 species). Trogiomorpha comprises infraorder Atropetae (extant families Lepidopsocidae, Psoquillidae and Trogiidae, and fossil families Archaeotropidae and Empheriidae) and infraorder Psocathropetae (families Psyllipsocidae and Prionoglarididae). =Suborder Troctomorpha= Troctomorpha have antennae with 15‚Äì17 segments and two-segmented tarsi. Troctomorpha comprises the Infraorder Amphientometae (families Amphientomidae, Compsocidae, Electrentomidae, Musapsocidae, Protroctopsocidae and Troctopsocidae) and Infraorder Nanopsocetae (families Liposcelididae, Pachytroctidae and Sphaeropsocidae). Troctomorpha are now known to also contain the order Phthiraptera (lice), and are therefore paraphyletic, as are Psocoptera as a whole. Some Troctomorpha, such as Liposcelis (which are similar to lice in morphology), are often found in birds' nests, and it is possible that a similar behavior in the ancestors of lice is at the origin of the parasitism seen today. =Suborder Psocomorpha= Psocomorpha are notable for having antennae with 13 segments. They have two- or three-segmented tarsi, this condition being constant (e.g. Psocidae) or variable (e.g. Pseudocaeciliidae) within families. Their wing venation is variable, the most common type being that found in the genus Caecilius (rounded, free areola postica, thickened, free pterostigma, r+s two-branched, m three-branched). Additional veins are found in some families and genera (Dicropsocus and Goja in Epipsocidae, many Calopsocidae, etc.) Psocomorpha is the largest suborder of the Psocoptera sensu stricto (i.e. excluding Phthiraptera), with about 3,600 species in 24 families, ranging from the species-poor Bryopsocidae (2 spp.) to the speciose Psocidae (about 900 spp). Psocomorpha comprises Infraorder Epipsocetae (families Cladiopsocidae, Dolabellopsocidae, Epipsocidae, Neurostigmatidae and Ptiloneuridae), Infraorder Caeciliusetae (families Amphipsocidae, Asiopsocidae, Caeciliusidae, Dasydemellidae and Stenopsocidae), Infraorder Homilopsocidea (families Archipsocidae, Bryopsocidae, Calopsocidae, Ectopsocidae, Elipsocidae, Lachesillidae, Mesopsocidae, Peripsocidae, Philotarsidae, Pseudocaeciliidae and Trichopsocidae) and Infraorder Psocetae (families Hemipsocidae, Myopsocidae, Psilopsocidae and Psocidae).

It was established, and is still centred, on a Welland River tributary called Lyons Creek. It is almost entirely a bedroom community, as there are few employers located in the area. History The community predates the establishment of what is now downtown Welland. In 1799, when present-day Welland was farmland, the Yokom family came from Pennsylvania and built a grist mill on Lyon's Creek. (Today, one of the roads in Cooks Mills is called Yokom Road after them.) Just before the War of 1812, an Englishman called Calvin Cook purchased the mill and added a tannery, a sawmill and a distillery. The place known as Cook's Mills became a prominent community of the Crowland Township; some early maps call the location Crowland Village. Towards the end of the War of 1812, a fire fight occurred at Cooks Mills, involving an American contingent sent to destroy flour and grain that might benefit the British. Early on the morning of October 19, 1814, the American picket at Misener's Hollow, just east of the mills, was attacked by soldiers of the Glengarry Light Infantry. The British force was supported by a 6-pound field cannon and Congreve rockets. The Americans succeeded in driving off the British, and threw the grain and flour into the mill pond. Lyon's Creek headwaters were in the Wainfleet Marsh. However, they were cut off by the construction of the Feeder Canal for the Welland Canal. The creek was carried under the canal through a stone culvert. Due to the construction, the water level in the marsh slowly receded. All the while, the culvert was being clogged up by debris. Eventually, the flow in Lyons Creek decreased to the extent when it was no longer able to turn the water wheels at Cook's Mills. The industries were closed and abandoned. Thus, the canal, which contributed greatly to development of Welland, became an indirect cause of an economic recession for Cook's Mills. Later on, Welland beat neighbouring communities in the running for the county seat. Cook's Mills became a farming area as opposed to Welland's industrial centre. Over time, the apostrophes indicating the possessive in Lyon's Creek and Cook's Mills were dropped following a trend in the region exemplified by St. Catharines and St. Johns. On January 1, 1961, the Crowland Township, including Cooks Mills, was incorporated into the City of Welland. By the time of construction of the Welland By-Pass in 1967-1973, the original headwaters in the Wainfleet Marsh have all but disappeared, and most of what flow there was in the creek was coming from an earlier tributary called Indian Creek by some maps. This made Lyons Creek somewhat U-shaped, as Indian Creek flowed west before joining the original Lyons Creek. During the By-Pass construction, the creek was cut into three parts, and now what was once Indian Creek flows into the canal (photo). A couple kilometres north, Lyons Creek is fed directly from the canal (photo). The middle part of the creek dried up and much of its bed was torn up during the construction of approaches to the Townline Tunnel. In a recent development, a study on the pollutants in the Niagara River done in 2000 found the organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to be present in the Lyons Creek. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment is investigating the source of PCBs and possible remedial actions to deal with contaminated sediment. Geography A typical Cooks Mills landscape in the winter. The Welland By-Pass channel separates Cooks Mills from the main urbanized area of City of Welland. The most direct ways of crossing the channel are the Main Street and Townline Tunnels. Built- up areas in Cooks Mills are located close to the roads; the rest of the area consists mainly of wooded lots and fields. The Niagara Road 27, commonly known as Schisler Road, linking Welland and Niagara Falls, runs to the north of the centre of the community, and Highway 140 runs to the west, while Montrose Road runs to the east, and Netherby Road runs to the south. The main area of Welland is located to the west. To the east is Niagara Falls, to the north is Thorold, and to the south is Port Colborne. References * Lewis, William H.

Its other goals included an equal, secret and direct vote for all Russian citizens and the self-determination of different nationalities (such as the Poles) that lived in the Russian Empire.

The forerunner of McKinley Senior High, was named the Hickory Street School, which was located several blocks East of the present site, in 1907-1908. The school outgrew the building, so the school was renamed The Baton Rouge Colored High School and moved to a new location. The Baton Rouge Colored High School was located at the corner of Perkins Road and Bynum Street in 1913. This facility was later struck by lightning and destroyed. McKinley is the oldest high school established for African Americans in East Baton Rouge Parish. McKinley's first graduating class was in 1916. The four students became the first African American high school graduates in Louisiana. The original McKinley High School building was constructed in 1926 and opened in 1927, and was named in honor of the 25th President of the United States. The school opened September 19, 1927 on Texas Street, currently name Thomas H. Delpit Drive. In 1950 the High School was moved to a new facility at the corner of Louise Street and McCalop Street, next to the present day I-10. The Thomas H. Delpit Drive facility became McKinley Junior High School. In 1962, the third and present day McKinley Senior High School was built on East McKinley Street, the Junior High School was moved to the I-10 site, and the Thomas H. Delpit Drive site became McKinley Elementary. The original McKinley Senior High School facility on Thomas H. Delpit Dr. was entered into the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1981, and was subsequently purchased by the Alumni Association from the East Baton Rouge Parish School Board on February 5, 1992.

B. M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury (1 December 1944 ‚Äì 15 December 2017) was a Bangladesh Awami League politician. He served as the mayor of Chittagong, the second-largest city in Bangladesh. He had held the office for three consecutive terms.  Early life  Chowdhury was born on 1 December 1944 in Gohira village, Raozan upazila, Chittagong District, East Bengal, British Raj. His father was Hosen Ahmen Chowdhury, was a railway officer, and his mother was Bedowra Begum. After completing his SSC he joined Chittagong City College in 1962. He transferred the same year to Chittagong Polytechnic Institute. He was expelled from the institute for his involvement in student politics. He returned to Chittagong City College in 1965 and graduated in 1967. He started post graduate course at the University of Chittagong with a major in Islamic History and Culture. He dropped out before completing his master's degree. Career Chowdhury was the general secretary of the Chittagong city unit of Chhatra League. He was leader of Sorbodolio Chhatra Sangram Parishad and organised a strike in Chittagong on 1 March 1971. After the 7 March 1971 speech by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Chowdhury and other student activists looted firearms from the Rifles Club and an arms depot in Majhirghat. He was arrested by the Pakistan Army soon but was released after he pretended to be insane in prison. He moved to India to train for the Mukti Bahini and was appointed a commander in the East Mount Battalion after his training. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, he formed a Mujib bahini unit to resist the Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad government. He was arrested by the government. he fled to India on being released. Chowdhury was elected Mayor of chittagong in 1994. He was the first elected Mayor of Chittagong city. He beat the Mir Mohammed Nasiruddin, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidate and previous mayor who was appointed to his post, to win the election by 16 thousand votes. He won his second election in 2000 easily after the election was boycotted by Bangladesh Nationalist Party. In 2005 the Bangladesh Nationalist Party government gave its full support to Mir Mohammed Nasiruddin. Prime Minister Khaleda Zia campaigned for Nasiruddin. Tarique Zia lived and campaigned in Chittagong for a week. Chowdhury still was able to secure an election win. He became the President of Chittagong city Awami League in 2006. He was elected mayor three times. He served 17 years until his electoral defeat by Bangladesh Nationalist Party candidate M Manjurul Alam in 2010. =Development work= During Chowdhury's term he established five maternity clinics. The hospital has specialized neonatal care and advanced gynaecological surgery facilities. The hospital is overseen by two consultant gynaecologists and a team of doctors. Chowdhury was the first mayor in Bangladesh to establish a private university ‚Äì Premier University, Chittagong, sponsored by the Chittagong City Corporation. After he took office, the corporation established nine postsecondary colleges, computer-training centres, a midwife training centre, a healthcare-technology training centre (the first in Bangladesh to train in the operation of health care technology including radiology and radiography) and eight night colleges to expand adult literacy. The Chittagong city authority also manages eight Hindu religious education centers (known as Sanskrit Toll) to provide religious education in Sanskrit to minority students. =Arrest in 2007 = After the army-backed government assumed power in Bangladesh in January 2007, Mohiuddin and other politicians in the country were arrested in an overnight raid on 7 March. He was incarcerated (mostly incommunicado) in various prisons in the country. When first arrested, unlike other arrested leaders he was taken to a remote jail in Bandarban (a district of Chittagong Hill Tracts). Whilst in prison, Chowdhury's daughter was diagnosed with blood cancer in Thailand. He was detained without trial for 21 months, the government did not release him from prison to see his dying daughter. He was finally released from prison on 8 October 2008 following a High Court order. Despite his release, the army- backed government retained his passport and did not allow him to fly to Thailand in time to see his daughter. On 17 October, when the government finally permitted him to fly abroad and just minutes before he boarded the aircraft en route to Bangkok, Chowdhury's daughter died.  Death  Chowdhury died at 3:00 am on 15 December 2017. He was buried in his family graveyard at Chashma Hill with an honor guard performed by Bangladesh Police.

Early life and career Oliver was born in Syracuse, NY and raised in Framingham, Massachusetts. She began writing at an early age and earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst. During this time she was involved with the university's theater department as a performer. While attending Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida for theatre, Oliver met director and screenwriter Alan Ball in 1976. Together they founded the General Nonsense Theater Company, a satirical ensemble for which the two wrote, staged and starred in subversive comical sketches. She was also a member of Alarm Dog Rep. A playwright whose work includes Office, Dreams Are Funny, Calypso\\" and \\"VW as well as several plays for young people, she twice won Florida's Individual Artist Grant for Playwriting. In addition to working previously as a teacher, columnist and newspaper editor, she studied Drama at the Banff Fine Arts Center in Canada and Trinity College, Oxford. She earned a Master of Arts degree in Acting and Directing from Florida State University. Career After graduating, Oliver supported herself by doing \\"anything anyone would pay me to do that was kind of mindless‚Äîtyping, filing, Xeroxing‚Äîso I could save the rest for writing and directing.\\" She moved to Los Angeles in 1997 after the computer game she was writing for, Riana Rouge, relocated to the West Coast. She later teamed up again with Alan Ball, becoming his script reader. A few years later, shortly after deciding to abandon show business and move back to Florida, Ball offered her a spot as a writer and co-producer for the award-winning television series Six Feet Under. Oliver began as a writer during the show's third season and stayed on for three years. The idea for her first screenplay, which would eventually be made into the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl, was the result of an early job in which she dealt \\"with a lot of Web sites and a lot of lonely guys.\\" Oliver considers the story, in which a lonely and delusional 27-year-old man forms a romantic attachment to a sex doll, a \\"contemporary fairy tale\\". After contemplating the concept for nearly five years, Oliver wrote the script over a nine-month period in 2002, before she was hired at Six Feet Under. In 2002, when her agent asked for a project to shop around, Oliver gave them Lars. In 2005, it was ranked No. 3 on the 2005 edition of The Black List, a compilation of the Top 90 most-liked, un-produced scripts in Hollywood. Directed by Craig Gillespie and starring Ryan Gosling, the film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival where it received a standing ovation from the audience.

Kawamura's wife Haru was the aunt of Saig≈ç Takamori. Biography A native of Satsuma, Kawamura studied navigation at Tokugawa bakufu naval school at Nagasaki, the Nagasaki Naval Training Center. In 1868, he joined his Satsuma clansmen, and fought on the imperial side in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration as an army general. He was especially noted for his role in the Battle of Aizu-Wakamatsu. Under the new Meiji government, he became an officer in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Navy, and steadily rose through the ranks. He became first Director of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1870 and taifu (senior vice minister) of Navy in 1872. He was in command of Japanese naval forces during the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. During the Satsuma Rebellion, he was placed in command of all Imperial troops in September 1877 at the final Battle of Shiroyama near Kumamoto, when Saig≈ç Takamori was killed (or committed seppuku). This battle, Saig≈ç's last stand against the Meiji government, was the historical basis for the 2003 film The Last Samurai. In 1878, Kawamura became sangi (councillor) and the second Navy Minister. He remained in that position until 1885 except when he was temporarily replaced by Enomoto Takeaki, and during that period he expanded the influence of people from Satsuma within the navy. In 1884, he was ennobled with the title of hakushaku (count) under the kazoku peerage system. Later serving as court councillor and Privy Councillor, in 1901 he was given responsibility for the upbringing of the newborn Prince Michi (the future Emperor Hirohito) and his younger brother Prince Chichibu (Yasuhito). In 1904, Kawamura was posthumously appointed to the rank of admiral, setting a precedent for such honors. His cause of death remains unknown, setting a mystery.

It is a putative species of the genus Cannabis. Whether it and Cannabis sativa are truly separate species is a matter of debate. The Cannabis indica plant is cultivated for many purposes; for example, the plant fibers can be converted into cloth. Cannabis indica produces large amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The higher concentrations of THC provide euphoric and intoxicating effects making it popular for use both as a recreational and medicinal drug. Taxonomy In 1785, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck published a description of a second species of Cannabis, which he named Cannabis indica. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. Richard Evans Schultes described C. indica as relatively short, conical, and densely branched, whereas C. sativa was described as tall and laxly branched. Loran C. Anderson described C. indica plants as having short, broad leaflets whereas those of C. sativa were characterized as relatively long and narrow.Dr. Loran C. Anderson - FSU Biological Science Faculty Emeritus Cannabis indica plants conforming to Schultes's and Anderson's descriptions originated from the Hindu Kush mountain range. Because of the often harsh and variable (extremely cold winters, and warm summers) climate of those parts, C. indica is well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates. Cultivation Newly grown C. indica Broad-leafed Cannabis indica plants in the Indian Subcontinent are traditionally cultivated for the production of charas, a form of hashish. Pharmacologically, C. indica landraces tend to have higher THC content than C. sativa strains Some users report more of a \\"stoned\\" feeling and less of a \\"high\\" from C. indica when compared to C. sativa. (The terms sativa and indica, used in this sense, are more appropriately termed \\"narrow- leaflet\\" drug type and \\"wide-leaflet\\" drug type Cannabis indica (or Cannabis sativa subsp. indica depending on the monotypic or polytipic point of view), respectively.\\"Sativa vs Indica.\\" AMSTERDAM ‚Äì THE CHANNELS. Web. 05 Dec. 2010. .) The Cannabis indica high is often referred to as a \\"body buzz\\" and has beneficial properties such as pain relief in addition to being an effective treatment for insomnia and an anxiolytic, as opposed to sativa's more common reports of a cerebral, creative and energetic high, and even, albeit rarely, comprising hallucinations. Differences in the terpenoid content of the essential oil may account for some of these differences in effect. Common indica strains for recreational or medicinal use include Kush and Northern Lights. A recent genetic analysis included both the narrow-leaflet and wide- leaflet drug \\"biotypes\\" under C. indica, as well as southern and eastern Asian hemp (fiber/seed) landraces and wild Himalayan populations. File:indica leaf.jpgBroad leaf of a C. indica plant File:Cannab2 new.pngCannabis File:Flowers(Purple Kush).jpgCannabis indica flowering =Difference between C. indica and C. sativa= There are several key differences between Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa. These include height and stature, internodal length, leaf size and structure, buds size and density, flowering time, odour, smoke and effects. Indica plants tend to grow shorter and bushier than the sativa plants. Indica strains tend to have wide, short leaves with short wide blades, whereas sativa strains have long leaves with thin long blades. The buds of indica strains tend to be wide, dense and bulky, while sativa strains are likely to be long, sausage shaped flowers. On average, Cannabis indica has higher levels of THC compared to CBD, whereas Cannabis sativa has lower levels of THC to CBD. However, huge variability exists within either species. A 2015 study shows the average THC content of the most popular herbal cannabis products in the Netherlands has decreased slightly since 2005. In the recent era of cannabis breeding higher-ratio CBD strains are being developed from Indica origins that may test out as 1:1 (CBD-THC balanced) or even as high as a 22:1 (CBD dominant). The medical interests in Cannabis are taking this further and we will see increasing cultivation trends for more strains developed with CBD-dominant ratios. In California, cities such as Coachella and Desert Hot Springs are re-zoning areas for cannabis cultivation. Even though Californians legalized recreational use of cannabis in late 2016, the LA Times, prior to the vote, reported an entrepreneurial focus on CBD-dominant medical hemp crops, \\"The demand for medical products was so high, this [ cultivation expansion] was just to fill the need for that.\\" Low anxiety and hallucinogenic properties (psychoactive effects of THC reduced by CBD) make these \\"high-CBD strains\\" very desirable for chronic treatment programs. There are three chemotaxonomic types of Cannabis: one with high levels of THC, one which is more fibrous and has higher levels of CBD, and one that is an intermediate between the two. Cannabis strains with CBD:THC ratios above 5:2 are likely to be more relaxing and produce less anxiety than vice versa. This may be due to CBD's antagonistic effects at the cannabinoid receptors, compared to THC's partial agonist effect. CBD is also a 5-HT1A receptor (serotonin) agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic-content effect. The effects of sativa are well known for its cerebral high. Users can expect a more vivid and uplifting high, while indica is well known for its sedative effects which some prefer for night time use. Indica possesses a more calming, soothing, and numbing experience in which can be used to relax or relieve pain. Both types are used as medical cannabis. During the 1970s, Cannabis indica strains from Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan particularly from the Hindu Kush mountain range were brought to the United States, where the first hybrids with Cannabis sativa plants from equatorial areas were developed, widely spreading marijuana cultivation throughout the States.Tom Flowers, Marijuana flower forcing, Quick American Archives, 1997, p.48 Plants with elevated levels of propyl cannabinoids, including tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), have been found in populations of Cannabis indica from India, Nepal, Thailand, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, as well as southern and western Africa. THCV levels up to 53.7% of total cannabinoids have been reported The name indica originally referred to the geographical area in which the plant was grown. Whether C. sativa and C. indica are separate species is still a matter of debate. However, investigation into chemotaxonomic differences support a two-species hypothesis. Genome In 2011, a team of Canadian researchers led by Andrew Sud announced that they had sequenced a draft genome of the Purple Kush variety of C. indica.

Biography Shelomo Dov (Fritz) Goitein was born in the town of Burgkunstadt in Upper Franconia, Germany; his father, Dr. Eduard Goitein, was born in Hungary to a long line of rabbis. The name Goitein points probably to Kojet√≠n in Moravia as the city of origin of the family. He was brought up with both secular and Talmudic education. In 1914 his father died and the family moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he finished high school and university. During 1918‚Äì23 he studied Arabic and Islam at the University of Frankfurt under the guidance of the famous scholar Josef Horovitz, while continuing his Talmudic study with a private teacher. He left the university with a dissertation on prayer in Islam. In the year 1923, Goitein fulfilled his lifelong dream and immigrated together with Gershom Scholem sailing to Palestine, where he stayed for thirty-four years. He lived four years in Haifa until he was invited to lecture at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which had been inaugurated two years earlier. In Jerusalem, he married Theresa Gottlieb (1900‚Äì1987), a eurhythmics teacher who composed songs and plays for children. They had three children, Ayala, Ofra, and Elon. In 1957 he moved to the United States where he felt more able to remain focused on his studies. He settled in Philadelphia and worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He died on February 6, 1985, the day his last volume of the series A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza (vol. 5) was sent to the publisher. Academic career In 1918‚Äì23, Goitein attended the universities of Frankfurt and Berlin and studied Islamic history under Josef Horovitz. His Ph.D. thesis was \\"on prayer in Islam.\\" He also pursued Jewish studies, and was a leader in the Zionist Youth Movement. In 1923 he immigrated to Palestine, where he taught Bible and Hebrew language at the Reali School in Haifa. In 1927 he wrote a play called Pulcellina about the blood libel killings in Blois in 1171. In 1928, he was appointed professor of Islamic History and Islamic Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was founder of the School of Asian and African studies and of the Israel Oriental Society. In 1928, he began his research of the language, culture and history of the Jews of Yemen. In 1949, he did research in Aden, questioning the Jews who gathered there from all parts of Yemen before being flown to Israel. In 1938-1948, he served as a senior education officer in Mandatory Palestine, responsible for Jewish and Arab Schools, and published books on methods of teaching the Bible and Hebrew. From 1948, Goitein began his life's work on the Cairo Geniza documents. An especially rich geniza with a large volume of correspondence was discovered in Old Cairo containing thousands of documents dating from the 9th to the 13th centuries. Since Jews began every letter or document with the words \\"With the help of God,\\" the papers reflected all aspects of everyday life in the countries of North Africa and bordering the Mediterranean. The documents included many letters from Jewish traders en route from Tunisia and Egypt to Yemen and ultimately to India. The papers were mostly written in Judeo-Arabic characters. After deciphering the documents, Goitein vividly reconstructed many aspects of Jewish life in the Middle Ages, publishing them in a six- volume monumental series, A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza (1967‚Äì1993). Although the documents were written by Jews, they reflect the surrounding Moslem and Christian environments not only in countries bordering the Mediterranean but all the way to India. This has thrown new light on the whole study of the Middle Ages. Agnon correspondence Goitein's lengthy correspondence with the Nobel Prize-winning author S.Y. Agnon was published by his daughter, Ayala Gordon, in 2008.Gentlemen and scholars, By Dan Laor, 14.01.09Gentlemen and scholars Dan Laor, Haaretz, Books, January 2009, p. 16 Agnon's wife, Esther, had studied Arabic privately with Goitein while she was a student at the University of Frankfurt. When Goitein moved to Jerusalem, he and Agnon became close friends. Most of the letters are from the mid-1950s onwards, after Goitein left Israel, a move of which Agnon was highly critical. Awards and recognition Goitein was awarded honorary degrees from many universities. He received research awards from Guggenheim (1965), Harvey (1980), and the MacArthur lifetime fellowship (1983). He received the National Jewish Book Award Scholarship for A Mediterranean Society Vol. IV in 1984.

Originally known as the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church, the United Church merged with other Lutheran groups to form the American Lutheran Church in 1960, which endured until 1988. History The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association in America (or Blair Church) was formed in 1884 by a group of Danish members who left the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Many of Blair Church pastors were supportive of the Inner Mission. The Blair Church was based in Blair, Nebraska. The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (or North Church) was formed in 1894 when seminary president Kristian Anker and professor Peter S√∏rensen Vig, along with a number of pastor and congregations, left the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America over theological differences. These two churches merged in 1896 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to form the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church (in addition to being known as the United Church, this new church continued to be referred to as the \\"Blair Church\\"). The United Church quickly formed a system of education, centered in Blair, Nebraska. The center-piece was Trinity Seminary, an institution designed for the training of pastors. Trinity was supported by the Dana School. The Dana School was originally intended to provide future pastors with a pre-seminary education, and others in the community with a secondary education. The school eventually became a two-year college, and then a four- year college, now known as Dana College. In 1946, as the second and third generation of Danes in America started to merge into the American culture, the word \\"Danish\\" was dropped from the official name of the church. In 1960, the United Church merged with churches that were ethnically German and Norwegian to form the American Lutheran Church. In 1959, just before its merger into the ALC, the United Church had 197 pastors, 164 congregations, and 66,623 members. In 1988, the American Lutheran Church became a part of the largest Lutheran denomination in America, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. As a result of the merger, Trinity Seminary closed its doors, becoming a part of Wartburg Theological Seminary. Dana College in Blair continued to be a college of the ELCA until its closure in 2010. Theology In the 19th century, the Lutherans in Denmark were divided into three different camps. Many in the church followed the ideas of the theologian and hymn writer N. F. S. Grundtvig. Another group, known as Inner Mission, was strongly influenced by European Pietism. This group was so opposed to the ideas of Grundtvig that they were often referred to as the \\"Anti-Grundtvigians\\". Finally, a third group known as the Centerists attempted to keep the church together by incorporating ideas from both groups. The United Church fell firmly in the Inner Mission or Anti-Grundtvigian camp. There was a strong emphasis on personal holiness in the United Church, and not much talk about the sacraments. This emphasis led to the United Church being known as the \\"sad Danes\\" or \\"holy Danes\\". While other Danish Lutherans in America tended to prefer pastors and leaders trained in Copenhagen, the United Church more quickly moved toward pastors trained in America in order to avoid the influence of Grundtvigian theology.Wolf, Edmund Jacob.

Many scholars accept Cannabis ruderalis as its own species due to its unique traits and phenotypes which distinguish it from Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa; however, it is widely debated by many other scholars as to whether or not ruderalis is a subspecies of Cannabis sativa. Etymology Cannabis ruderalis was first described by Russian botanist D. E. Janischewsky in 1924. The term ruderalis is derived from the Latin r≈´dera, which is the plural form of r≈´dus, a Latin word meaning rubble, lump, or rough piece of bronze. A ruderal species refers to any plant that is the first to colonize land after a disturbance removing competition.  Genetic origin  It is widely accepted C. ruderalis is its own species, rather than a subspecies from C. sativa. It was classified in 1924 by D. E. Janischewsky, noting the visible differences in seed, shape and size from previously classified Cannabis sativa. C. ruderalis represent feral types of Cannabis which have higher CBD levels and a more cerebral effect, this combined with the high THC levels from the C. sativa through hybridization gives the most potent strains. C. ruderalis occupies regions farther north in latitude. Chemotaxonomic analysis reveals that C. ruderalis is shown to have lower tetrahydrocannabinol levels compared to the feral biotype of C. sativa. Morphology Cannabis ruderalis is smaller than other species of Cannabis. C. ruderalis rarely grows over two feet in height. Plants have \\"thin, slightly fibrous stems\\" with little branching. Foliage is typically open with large leaves, C. ruderalis reaches maturity much quicker than other species of Cannabis, typically in a five to seven week period from seed. Unlike other species of cannabis, Cannabis ruderalis enters the flowering stage based on the maturity of the plant, rather than its light cycle. With C. sativa and C. indica varieties, it is possible to keep the plant in the vegetative state indefinitely by maintaining a long daylight cycle. C. ruderalis, however, will enter the flowering stage regardless of daily light duration. Cannabis geneticists today refer to this feature as \\"auto-flowering\\". It has less THC in its resin compared to other Cannabis species. However, it is often high in cannabidiol (CBD). Origin and range Cannabis ruderalis was first scientifically identified in 1924 in southern Siberia, although it also grows wild in other areas of Russia. The Russian botanist, Janischewski, was studying wild Cannabis in the Volga River system and realized he had come upon a third species. C. ruderalis is a hardier variety grown in the northern Himalayas and southern states of the former Soviet Union, characterized by a more sparse, \\"weedy\\" growth. Similar C. ruderalis populations can be found in most of the areas where hemp cultivation was once prevalent. The most notable region in North America is the midwestern United States, though populations occur sporadically throughout the United States and Canada. Large wild C. ruderalis populations are also found in central and eastern Europe, most of them in Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and adjacent countries. Without human selection, these plants have lost many of the traits they were originally selected for, and have acclimated to their environment. Cultivation Seeds of C. ruderalis were brought to Amsterdam in the early 1980s in order to enhance the breeding program of the Seed Bank. Cannabis ruderalis has a lower THC content than either C. sativa or C. indica, so it is rarely grown for recreational use and the shorter stature of C. ruderalis limits its application for hemp production. Cannabis ruderalis strains are high in the cannab—ñnoid cannabidiol (CBD), so they are grown by some medical marijuana users. However, C. ruderalis' early, plant-age triggered \\"autoflowering\\" characteristic (which offers some agricultural advantages over the photoperiodic flowering varieties) as well as its reputed resistance to insect and disease pressures makes it attractive to plant breeders. C. indica strains are frequently cross-bred with C. ruderalis to produce autoflowering plants with high THC content, improved hardiness and reduced height. One strain, identified in 1960, is Cannabis x intersita Sojak which is a cross between C. sativa and C. ruderalis. Attempts to produce a Cannabis strain with a shorter growing season are another application of cultivating C. ruderalis. C. ruderalis when crossed with sativa and indica strains produces a plant which flowers automatically and is fully mature in 10 weeks.  Use in auto- flowering cannabis strains  Because C. ruderalis transitions from the vegetative stage to the flowering stage with age, as opposed to the light cycle required with photoperiod strains, it is bred with other household sativa and indica strains of cannabis to create \\"Auto-flowering cannabis strains\\". These strains are favorable for cultivars because they exhibit the hardiness of ruderalis plants while still maintaining the medicinal effects of sativa and indica strains. The Auto-flowering trait is extremely beneficial because it allows for multiple harvests in one outdoor growing season without the use of light deprivation techniques necessary for multiple harvest of photo-period strains. As a result of ruderalis genetics, auto-flowering plants typically have much higher CBD levels than photo-period cannabis.  Common uses  Cannabis ruderalis is traditionally used in Russian and Mongolian folk medicine, especially for uses in treating depression. Because C. ruderalis is among the lowest THC producing biotypes of Cannabis, C. ruderalis is rarely used for recreational purposes. In modern use, C. ruderalis has been crossed with Bedrocan strains to produce the strain Bediol for patients with medical prescriptions. C. sativa and C. indica strains bred with ruderalis plants typically exhibit the \\"autoflowering\\" phenotype exhibited by the C. ruderalis lineage, meaning that they flower when the plant reaches a certain maturity (usually ten weeks from seed) as opposed to flowering in accordance with the daily light schedules. In addition to this, due to the typically higher concentration of cannabidiol (CBD), ruderalis plants are valuable for patients looking to treat anxiety or epilepsy. C. ruderalis is also being used as a form of cancer treatment as well as sclerosis and loss of appetite.

He was made a Queen's Counsel in 1983. Career He was an alderman on Halifax city council from 1974 to 1980 and served as deputy mayor from 1977 to 1978. He has also served as Chairman of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for Halifax and Dartmouth; Chairman of the Halifax Metro Centre, and as a member of the Board of Governors of Saint Mary's University. He also serves as Chairman of the Bluenose II Preservation Trust. Appointment to the Senate Moore was appointed to the Senate on the advice of Jean Chr√©tien on September 26, 1996. He sits as a Liberal. Moore criticized the December 2008 senate appointments of 18 Conservative loyalists by Prime Minister Stephen Harper saying,\\"With regard to the rumoured filling of the vacancies, you have to look at the motivation...Is it just because he's afraid of losing government or is it because he wants the chamber to work, causing him to do his constitutional duty?...If it does happen I'm pleased the Senate will be filled and the chamber can work properly as one of our two houses of Parliament\\". On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Moore, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau- removes-senators-from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273 The Senators referred to themselves as the Senate Liberal Caucus even though they were no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.

(Victor Gillam, Judge magazine, 1 April 1899) Original publication of \\"The White Man's Burden\\" in McClure's Magazine, February 1899 \\"The White Man\\"s Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands\\" (1899), by Rudyard Kipling, is a poem about the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War (1899‚Äì1902), which exhorts the United States to assume colonial control of the Filipino people and their country.Hitchens, Christopher. Blood, Class, and Empire: The Enduring Anglo‚ÄìAmerican Relationship (2004) pp. 63‚Äì64 Originally written to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria (22 June 1897), the jingoistic poem was replaced with the sombre \\"Recessional\\" (1897), also a Kipling poem about empire. In \\"The White Man's Burden\\", Kipling encouraged American colonization and annexation of the Philippine Islands, a Pacific Ocean archipelago conquered in the three-month Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898). As a poet of imperialism, Kipling exhorts the American reader and listener to take up the enterprise of empire, yet warns about the personal costs faced, endured, and paid in building an empire; nonetheless, American imperialists understood the phrase the white man‚Äôs burden to justify imperial conquest as a mission-of-civilisation that is ideologically related to the continental- expansion philosophy of Manifest Destiny of the early 19th century. p. 5: \\". . . imperialist editors came out in favor of retaining the entire archipelago (using) higher-sounding justifications related to the \\"white man's burden\\".Examples of justification for imperialism based on Kipling's poem include the following (originally published 1899‚Äì1902): * : \\"An extraordinary sensation has been created by Mr. Rudyard Kipling's new poem, The White Man's Burden, just published in a New York magazine.

Also available at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (full text).: characterising the poem as a \\"call to imperial conquest\\".  History  The White Man's Burden: civilising the unwilling savage. (Detroit Journal, 1898) The poem \\"The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands\\" was first published in The Times (London) on 4 February 1899, and in The New York Sun on 5 February 1899. On 7 February 1899, during senatorial debate to decide if the US should retain control of the Philippine Islands and the ten million Filipinos conquered from the Spanish Empire, Senator Benjamin Tillman read aloud the first, the fourth, and the fifth stanzas of Kipling's eight-stanza poem as arguments against ratification of the Treaty of Peace between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Spain (Treaty of Paris, 10 December 1898); and that the US should formally renounce claim of authority over the Philippine Islands. To that effect, Senator Tillman addressed the matter to President William McKinley:Herman, Shadowing the White Man's Burden (2010), pp. 41‚Äì42. He quotes, inter alia, stanzas 1, 4, and 5 of \\"The White Man's Burden\\", noting: Senator Tillman's eloquence was unpersuasive, and the US Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris on 11 February 1899, formally ending the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. After paying a post-war indemnification of twenty million dollars to the Kingdom of Spain, on 11 April 1899, the US established geopolitical hegemony upon islands and peoples in two oceans and in two hemispheres: the Philippine Islands and Guam in the Pacific Ocean, and Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Atlantic Ocean.  Text  Calcutta, India. (1892) \\"The White (?) Man's Burden\\" shows the colonial exploitation of labour of the poor nations by the rich nations of the world. (William Henry Walker, Life magazine, 16 March 1899)  Interpretation  The American writer Mark Twain replied to the imperialism Kipling espoused in \\"The White Man's Burden\\" with the satirical essay \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness\\" (1901), about the anti-imperialist Boxer Rebellion (1899) in China. The imperialist interpretation of \\"The White Man's Burden\\" (1899) proposes that the white race is morally obliged to civilise the non-white peoples of planet Earth, and to encourage their progress (economic, social, and cultural) through settler colonialismThe Oxford Companion to English Literature 6th Edition (2006) p. 808.: Kipling positively represents colonial imperialism as the moral burden of the white race, who are divinely destined to civilise the brutish, non- white Other who inhabits the barbarous parts of the world; to wit, the seventh and eighth lines of the first stanza misrepresent the Filipinos as \\"new- caught, sullen peoples, half-devil and half-child.\\"Ben√©t's Reader's Encyclopedia, Fourth Edition (1996) pp. 1,111‚Äì1.112 Despite the chauvinistic nationalism that supported Western imperialism in the 19th century, public moral opposition to Kipling's racialist misrepresentation of the colonial exploitation of labour in \\"The White Man's Burden\\" produced the satirical essay \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness\\" (1901), by Mark Twain, which catalogues the Western military atrocities of revenge committed against the Chinese people for their anti-colonial Boxer Rebellion (1899‚Äì1901) against abusive European businessmen and Christian missionaries. Politically, Kipling proffered the poem to New York governor Theodore Roosevelt (1899‚Äì1900) to help him persuade anti-imperialist Americans to accept the territorial annexation of the Philippine Islands to the United States.: \\"Theodore Roosevelt . . . thought the verses 'rather poor poetry, but good sense, from the expansionist stand-point'. Henry Cabot Lodge told Roosevelt, in turn: 'I like it. I think it is better poetry than you say.' \\"Greenblatt, Stephen. Norton Anthology of English Literature, New York 2006 .Wolpert, Stanley (2006)Brantlinger, Patrick (2007). \\"Kipling's 'The White Man's Burden' and its Afterlives\\", English Literature in Transition 1880‚Äì1920, 50.2, pp. 172‚Äì191. In September 1898, Kipling's literary reputation in the U.S. allowed his promotion of American empire to Governor Roosevelt: As Victorian imperial poetry, \\"The White Man's Burden\\" thematically corresponds to Kipling's belief that the British Empire was the Englishman's \\"Divine Burden to reign God's Empire on Earth\\";Greenblatt, Stephen, Norton Anthology of English Literature, New York, 2006 , p. 000.What Will Happen In Afghanistan?\\". United Press International. 26 September 2001. and celebrates British colonialism as a mission of civilisation that eventually would benefit the colonised natives. Roosevelt sent the poem to Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a firm believer in Western imperialism himself, for his review, and they agreed that it made \\"good sense from the expansion standpoint.\\" Since the late nineteenth century, \\"The White Man's Burden\\" has served the arguments and counterarguments of supporters and the opponents of imperialism and white supremacy.  Responses  To the white man's burden, the civilising mission of colonialism includes teaching coloured people about soap, water, and personal hygiene. (1890s advert) In the early 20th century, in addition to \\"To the Person Sitting in Darkness\\" (1901), Mark Twain's factual satire of the civilising mission proposed, justified, and defended in \\"The White Man's Burden\\" (1899), it was Kipling's jingoism that provoked contemporary poetic parodies that expressed anti-imperialist moral outrage, by critically addressing the white-supremacy racism that is basic to colonial empire;Ben√©t's Reader's Encyclopedia, Fourth Edition (1996), p. 560. among the literary responses to Kipling are: \\"The Brown Man's Burden\\" (February 1899), by the British politician Henry Labouch√®re;Labouch√®re, Henry (1899). \\"The Brown Man's Burden\\", a parody of Kipling's white-burden. \\"The Black Man's Burden: A Response to Kipling\\" (April 1899), by the clergyman H. T. Johnson; and the poem \\"Take Up the Black Man's Burden\\", by the American educator J. Dallas Bowser.Brantlinger, Patrick. Taming Cannibals: Race and the Victorians, Cornell University Press, 2011. p. 215. In the U.S., a Black Man's Burden Association demonstrated to Americans how the colonial mistreatment of Filipino brown people in their Philippine homeland was a cultural extension of the institutional racism of the Jim Crow laws (1863‚Äì1965) for the legal mistreatment of black Americans in their U.S. homeland. The very positive popular response to Kipling‚Äôs jingoism for an American Empire to annex the Philippines as a colony impelled the growth of the American Anti-Imperialist League in their opposition to making colonial subjects of the Filipinos. In ‚ÄúThe Poor Man‚Äôs Burden‚Äù (1899), Dr. Howard S. Taylor addresses the negative psycho-social effects of the imperialist ethos upon the working-class people of an empire. In the social perspective of \\"The Real White Man's Burden\\" (1902), the reformer Ernest Crosby addresses the moral degradation (coarsening of affect) consequent to the practice of imperialism; Published online by History Matters, American Social History Project, CUNY and George Mason University. and in \\"The Black Man's Burden\\" (1903), the British journalist E. D. Morel reported the Belgian imperial atrocities in the Congo Free State, which was an African personal property of King Leopold II of Belgium. In the historical survey of The Black Man's Burden: The White Man in Africa, from the Fifteenth Century to World War I (1920), E. D. Morel's critique of imperial- colony power relations identifies an established cultural hegemony that determines the weight of the black man's burden and the weight of the white man's burden in their building a colonial empire.Morel, Edmund (1903). The Black Man's Burden. Fordham University. The philosophic perspective of \\"The Black Man's Burden [A Reply to Rudyard Kipling]\\" (1920), by the social critic Hubert Harrison, describes moral degradation as a consequence of being a colonized coloured man and of being a white colonizer. Moreover, since the late 20th-century contexts of post-imperial decolonisation and of the developing world, the phrase \\"The white man's burden\\" is often used by critics of foreign expansionism and interventionism to illustrate the perceived false good-intentions of Western neo-colonialism for the non-white world: civilisation by colonial domination.Plamen Makariev. Eurocentrism, Encyclopedia of the Developing World (2006) Thomas M. Leonard, Ed. , p. 636: \\"On one hand, this is the Western 'well-intended' aspiration to dominate 'the developing world.' The formula 'the white man's burden', from Rudyard Kipling's eponymous poem, is emblematic in this respect.\\"; Chisholm, Michael. Modern World Development: A Geographical Perspective. Rowman & Littlefield, 1982, , p.12: \\"This Eurocentric view of the world assumed that, but for the 'improvements' wrought by Europeans in Latin America, in Africa and in Asia, the manifest poverty of their peoples would be even worse.\\"; and Rieder, John. Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction 2008. Wesleyan University Press, Middleton, Conn., p. 30: \\"The proto-narrative of progress operates equally in the ideology of the 'white man's burden' -- the belief that non-whites are childlike innocents in need of white men's protection -- and the assumptions that undergird Victorian anthropology. From the most legitimate scientific endeavor to the most debased and transparent prejudices runs the common assumption that the relation of the colonizing societies to the colonized ones is that of the developed, modern present to its own undeveloped, primitive past.\\"  See also  * Colonialism * Orientalism * White savior * Yellow Peril * Rudyard Kipling bibliography * \\"The Gods of the Copybook Headings\\" (1919), by Rudyard Kipling * The Tears of the White Man, by Pascal Bruckner * The Tyranny of Guilt, by Pascal Bruckner  Citations   General references  * A Companion to Victorian Poetry, Alison Chapman; Blackwell, Oxford, 2002. * Chisholm, Michael (1982).

The film was written and directed by Desmond Nakano. The film revolves around Louis Pinnock (John Travolta), a white factory worker, who kidnaps Thaddeus Thomas (Harry Belafonte), a black factory owner for firing him over a perceived slight. The title is a well-known phrase inspired by the famous poem of the same title by Rudyard Kipling.  Plot  At dinner, wealthy black CEO Thaddeus Thomas discusses white people and claims they are \\"genetically inferior\\" because the children grow up without fathers. Trying to improve himself, white candy factory worker Louis Pinnock offers to deliver a package to Thomas after his shift. Pinnock is let into the property by a white servant at the security gate point in front of the Thomas residence and accidentally views Thomas's wife naked through the window. Thomas notices and complains to the VP at the factory, during a dinner engagement at his house, that he would prefer a different delivery man instead of a \\"Peeping Tom\\". Although Thomas does not suggest any form of punishment towards Pinnock, the VP \\"gets the message\\" and immediately fires Pinnock. Pinnock returns to the Thomas residence in an attempt to discuss the misunderstanding with Thomas, but because Thomas is in an important business meeting, he refuses and sends a message to Pinnock that he apologizes, but there is nothing that he can do to help him. Pinnock begs for two minutes of his time, but is turned away. Without any education or advanced skills, Pinnock finds difficulty getting a job and is unable to support his family. The Pinnock family are awakened one early morning by the police and the landlord to enforce eviction; the family struggles to gather their important belongings as they vacate the premises. Pinnock's mother-in-law scolds him for failing as a man; she says there is not enough room for him at her house where his wife and two children are going. Pinnock's truck breaks down and he is forced to walk. At night, Pinnock is apprehended by the police who mistake him for a bank robber because \\"he fit the description\\". The people inside a bar come outside and shout at the police, demanding that they leave Pinnock alone. Pinnock is beaten by the police but they are chased away by the angry mob. In a quest for justice, Pinnock kidnaps Thomas at gunpoint and demands a large sum of money that he believes is owed him for losing his job. After multiple failed attempts to withdraw the money, Pinnock holds Thomas hostage for the weekend and takes him through the ghetto where he lives. Thomas, however, remains unsympathetic to Pinnock and calls him a failure who blames the world for his problems. But Pinnock takes Thomas through the ghetto anyway, and Thomas alternates between enjoying some of the staples of ghetto life and having his eyes open to this world's racism. Pinnock calls the police to aid Thomas in his breathing problems but is mistakenly shot and killed because the police assume he is armed.

He was Ozzy Osbourne's drummer during the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, and later as drummer for M√∂tley Cr√ºe, from 1999 to his death in 2002. Early life Castillo was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was inspired to take up the drums after seeing The Beatles perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. Randy's first rock band in Albuquerque was a hard rock cover band, \\"The Wumblies,\\" which later moved to Denver, Colorado before breaking up in 1980. Randy Castillo is part Apache Native American. The Wumblies Career In 1984, Castillo was hired to play drums for Lita Ford and was featured on her Dancin' on the Edge album. Ford introduced Castillo to her boyfriend, M√∂tley Cr√ºe bassist Nikki Sixx, and Nikki‚Äôs bandmate Tommy Lee. Shortly after the ‚ÄúDancin‚Äô on the Edge‚Äù tour, Lee called Castillo from a party he was at with Ozzy Osbourne and told him Ozzy was looking for a new drummer. Despite being unable to audition right away due to a broken leg he suffered while skiing, Castillo was hired by Osbourne a couple months later and ended up staying with the Ozzy Osbourne band for ten years, recording five albums with Ozzy during that time: The Ultimate Sin (1986), No Rest for the Wicked (1988), Just Say Ozzy (1990), No More Tears (1991), and a double-disc live album, Live & Loud (1993). After recording Ozzy's live album in 1993, he joined the short-lived Bone Angels, followed by Red Square Black. Castillo also briefly returned to Osbourne's band in 1995 for a tour, and played drums on several tribute albums during this time. He played with Ronnie James Dio on a cover of Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" on the Alice Cooper tribute album \\"Welcome To The Nightmare (An All Star Tribute To Alice Cooper)Release Date: 4/19/2005 Label: Cleopatra UPC: 741157148329 Catalog Number: 1483 \\" and performed all drumming duties on a star-studded Def Leppard tribute album titled Leppardmania.

Guitar and bass duties were handled by Jerry Dixon and Erik Turner of Warrant, and Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns. In 1999, after Lee had left M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Sharon Osbourne called Castillo and suggested he join the band, which he did without audition. He'd previously briefly played with Vince Neil as a touring drummer for the Vince Neil Band, and was an old friend of the band. His only recording with the band, 2000's New Tattoo, was somewhat of a return to the classic M√∂tley Cr√ºe sound. However, fan reaction was mixed and the album was not as successful as the band was hoping it would be. Still, there was excitement over the upcoming tour due to the revival in interest of many '80s hard rock acts, and the band geared up for their \\"Maximum Rock\\" tour with thrash metal legends Anthrax and Megadeth. Death Several weeks before M√∂tley Cr√ºe was set to tour the New Tattoo album, joining Megadeth and Anthrax on the Maximum Rock Tour, Castillo became ill while performing with his mariachi side project Azul at the Cat Club in Hollywood. Immediately after the show Castillo took a cab to nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a duodenal ulcer that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo‚Äôs life. With Castillo out of action, Hole drummer Samantha Maloney filled in for the tour. In October 2000, while taking time off from M√∂tley Cr√ºe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to roughly the size of a golf ball, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated. The cancer went into remission in mid-2001, and he was rumored to be rejoining Osbourne's solo band for that summer Ozzfest tour (along with Geezer Butler on bass), though these rumors were later revealed to be untrue. Within a few months the cancer returned, and a few days after returning to the doctors, Castillo died on March 26, 2002 aged 51. During the final weeks of his life, Castillo had been working with ex-Ozzy Osbourne and Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez on a new band and was in the process of hiring a singer. Equipment For much of his career, Castillo exclusively used Tama drums (DW Drums from the late 1990s until his death), Remo drum heads, Zildjian cymbals, and Pro-mark drumsticks.

It is actually a variety of muskmelon (C. melo), a species closely related to the cucumber (C. sativus). It is also known as the yard-long cucumber, snake cucumber, snake melon, in Kurdish, in Japanese, in Turkish, in Hindi, in Punjabi, in Arabic, or in Italian. It should not be confused with the snake gourds (Trichosanthes spp.). The skin is very thin, light green, and bumpless. It has no bitterness and the fruit is almost always used without peeling. It is also sometimes called a gutah. Description Armenian cucumbers for sale The Armenian cucumber grows approximately long. It grows equally well on the ground or on a trellis. Armenian cucumber plants prefer to grow in full sun for most of the day. The fruit is most flavorful when it is long. Pickled Armenian cucumber is sold in Middle Eastern markets as \\"Pickled Wild Cucumber\\". Wild Cucumbers Got You In a Pickle? History Fredric Hasselquist, in his travels in Asia Minor, Egypt, Cyprus and Syria in the 18th century, came across the \\"Egyptian or hairy cucumber, Cucumis chate\\", which is today included in the Armenian variety. It is said by Hasselquist to be the ‚Äúqueen of cucumbers, refreshing, sweet, solid, and wholesome.‚Äù He also states ‚Äúthey still form a great part of the food of the lower-class people in Egypt serving them for meat, drink and physic.‚Äù George E.

A study published in 2018 concluded that melon yields in Israel can be improved by selection of local landraces. The study examined landraces collected from 42 fields, finding extensive variations in certain traits that could be cultivated to improve the local production.

He was formerly the Police Chief of Aurora, Colorado He was also formerly the Chief of Police and Safety Services Administrator for the City of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Oates was appointed Chief of Police on August 20, 2001 after serving 21 years in the New York Police Department. In August 2002, Oates became Ann Arbor's first Safety Services Administrator. He is a charter member of the federal Criminal Intelligence Coordinating Council. While with the Aurora Police Department, he was responsible for the criminal investigation of a 2012 mass shooting at a local movie theater, which was one of the largest mass shootings in American history. Personal life Oates was born in Hackensack, New Jersey. He lived in nearby Oradell, before moving with his family to Midland Park, New Jersey, where he attended grade school at Nativity School. When Oates was 14 years old, he reached the rank of Eagle Scout, the Boy Scouts of America's highest rank. He received the award from a Troop chartered to the Church of the Nativity in Midland Park. Oates is married and has two adult daughters. Education Oates attended Saint Joseph Regional High School and graduated in 1973. He received his bachelor's degree at Bucknell University where he majored in English. At Bucknell, he was the newspaper and yearbook editor. He went on to receive a master's degree from New York University and received his Juris Doctorate in 1986 from New York Law School. Oates is licensed to practice law in Colorado, New York, and New Jersey. Career After graduating from Bucknell University, Oates took a job as a reporter for the Atlantic City Press. While covering courts, he became interested in a career as a police officer. Oates began that career with the New York Police Department. He walked a beat in New York's 19th precinct, located on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He worked his way up the ladder, and later held the position of second of command of New York's Brooklyn South Patrol Borough. In this position, he was in charge of 3,000 police officers and 700 civilians. He also served as commanding officer of the legal bureau of the New York City Police Department Cadet Corps.

Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje credited his newly hired police chief for mitigating attacks on Muslims after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Oates oversaw the emergency and fire department in addition to the police department. Due to budget concerns, Oates reduced the size of Ann Arbor's fire and police departments by 20%. At the same time he helped reduce the violent crime rate by 24%. Hieftje also noted that his straightforward management style was an asset to the department. Oates left Ann Arbor and became the police chief in Aurora, Colorado, in 2005 after the former chief, Ricky Bennett, was demoted for his department's failure to stop Brent J. Brents from committing sex crimes. Oates began his career in Aurora by building up a relationship between the police department and minority communities, specifically focusing on the black community whose members felt that the police force was used against minorities. During his first five years in Aurora, he oversaw a 30% decrease in the crime rate. Oates is currently teaching an online course in Constitutional law for Long Island University. =Theater shooting= Oates was the chief of police in Aurora at the time of a mass shooting at the midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises.

The Spalding philosophy is child centered, that is the physical and mental well-being of students is a primary concern of Spalding teachers. High expectations for all children are central to the philosophy. These principles of learning and instruction are applied throughout the spelling, writing, and reading curricula. Spalding instruction is explicit, interactive, diagnostic, and multisensory. Teachers model, coach, and provide support as needed; students articulate, reflect, and explore new concepts. Careful daily observation of student progress enables teachers to differentiate instruction to meet student needs. Students see, hear, say, and write using all channels to the brain to enhance retention. All elements of the language are integrated in spelling, writing, and reading lessons. The kindergarten through to sixth-grade curricula is structured, sequential, and cumulative. Phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, high-frequency vocabulary are taught in spelling. In the writing lesson, the same high-frequency words are used to teach word meanings, usage, word parts, grammar, and composition. In the reading lesson, students learn the attributes of fine literature, the structure of narrative and expository text, fluency, listening and reading comprehension. They learn to monitor their comprehension while reading, to make connections with prior knowledge and the text, to predict word meanings, type of writing, outcomes and so forth. They learn to reorganize (reformat) the information in text and use it to mentally summarize to enhance comprehension. References * Spalding, Romalda B., The Writing Road to Reading, North, Mary E.

Bezirk). It is near the centre of Vienna and was established as a district in 1850, but its borders were changed later. Wieden is a small region near the city centre. Wien.gv.at webpage (see below: References). After World War II, Wieden was part of the Soviet sector of Vienna for 10 years. __TOC__  History  The name Wieden was first recorded in 1137, and is thus the oldest Vorstadt (former municipality within the Linienwall) of Vienna. The main street (Wiedner Hauptstra√üe) is certainly even older. The district was the site of the former royal Summer residence, which was completed under Ferdinand II, and was expanded many times until Maria Theresa sold it to the Jesuits. Today it is the Theresianum, a prestigious private boarding school, while the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna resides in a wing of the building. In the beginning of the 18th century, the development of Wieden as a suburb began. Many palaces and other buildings were built. Two small Vorst√§dte in the area of the present fourth district were Hungelbrunn and Schamburgergrund. These three areas along with a number of others were incorporated into the city of Vienna as the fourth district on March 6, 1850. Because of social and economic differences, Margareten was separated from the fourth district to form the fifth district in 1861. The so-called Freihaus, built in 1700 and the largest apartment building/tenement of the time, was located in this area, although by 1970 its state had deteriorated. The name has been rehabilitated in recent years to give an identity to the local bars, restaurants and independent retailers.http://freihausviertel.at/ During the occupation by the allies (1945-1955), Wieden was part of the Soviet sector of Vienna.

Soon after the visit by the Magi, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream telling him to flee to Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus since King Herod would seek the child to kill him. The episode is frequently shown in art, as the final episode of the Nativity of Jesus in art, and was a common component in cycles of the Life of the Virgin as well as the Life of Christ. Within the narrative tradition, iconic representation of the \\"Rest on the Flight into Egypt\\" developed after the 14th century. Matthew's gospel account Fra Bartolomeo, Rest on the Flight into Egypt, c. 1500 (Pienza) Print of the flight into Egypt. Made by Johannes Wierix. =The flight from Herod= When the Magi came in search of Jesus, they went to Herod the Great in Jerusalem to ask where to find the newborn \\"King of the Jews\\". Herod became paranoid that the child would threaten his throne, and sought to kill him (). Herod initiated the Massacre of the Innocents in hopes of killing the child (Matthew 2:16‚ÄìMatthew 2:18). But an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and warned him to take Jesus and his mother into Egypt (Matthew 2:13). Egypt was a logical place to find refuge, as it was outside the dominions of King Herod, but both Egypt and Judea were part of the Roman Empire, linked by a coastal road known as \\"the way of the sea\\", making travel between them easy and relatively safe. =Return from Egypt= The Return of the Holy Family from Egypt by Jacob Jordaens (c. 1616) After a time, the holy family returned from Egypt. The text states that Herod had died. Herod is believed to have died in 4 BC, and while Matthew does not mention how, the Jewish historian Josephus vividly relates a gory death. The land that the holy family return to is identified as Judah, the only place in the entire New Testament where Judah acts as a geographic description of the whole of Judah and Galilee Matthew 2:20, rather than referring to a collection of religious people or the Jewish people in general. It is, however, to Judah that they are described as initially returning, although upon discovering that Archelaus had become the new king, they went instead to Galilee. Historically, Archelaus was such a violent and aggressive king that in the year 6 AD he was deposed by the Romans, in response to complaints from the population. Galilee was ruled by a much calmer king, Herod Antipas, and there is historical evidence that Galilee had become a refuge for those fleeing the iron rule of Archelaus. =Prophecy of Hosea= Matthew 2:15 cites Hosea as prophetically fulfilled in the return of Joseph, Mary and Jesus from Egypt: > \\"... and out of Egypt I called My son\\". Matthew's use of Hosea 11:1 has been explained in several ways. A sensus plenior approach states that the text in Hosea contains a meaning intended by God and acknowledged by Matthew, but unknown to Hosea. A typological reading interprets the fulfillment as found in the national history of Israel and the antitypical fulfillment as found in the personal history of Jesus. Matthew's use of typological interpretation may also be seen in his use of Isaiah and , and Jeremiah . Flight into Egypt, by Gentile da Fabriano (1423) Another reading of Hosea's prophetic declaration is that it only recounts God summoning of the nation of Israel out of Egypt during the Exodus, referring to Israel as God's son in accordance with Moses' declaration to Pharaoh: > \\"Israel is my first-born son; let my son go, that he may serve me\\" ().

These stories of the time in Egypt have been especially important to the Coptic Church, which is based in Egypt, and throughout Egypt there are a number of churches and shrines marking places where the family stayed. The most important of these is the church of Abu Serghis, which claims to be built on the place the family had its home. One of the most extensive and, in Eastern Christianity, influential accounts of the Flight appears in the perhaps seventh-century Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, in which Mary, tired by the heat of the sun, rested beneath a palm tree. The infant Jesus then miraculously has the palm tree bend down to provide Mary with its fruit, and release from its roots a spring to provide her with water.Mustafa Akyol, The Islamic Jesus: How the King of the Jews Became a Prophet of the Muslims (New York: St Martin's Press, 2017), pp. 114-15. =Muslim= The Qur'ƒÅn does not include the tradition of the Flight into Egypt, though s≈´ra XXIII, 50 could conceivably allude to it: ‚ÄúAnd we made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs‚Äù. However, its account of the birth of Jesus is very similar to the account of the Flight in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew: Mary gives birth leaning against the trunk of a date-palm, which miraculously provides her with dates and a stream. It is therefore thought that one tradition owes something to the other.A.J. Wensinck and Penelope C. Johnstone, ‚ÄúMaryam‚Äù, in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, ed. by P. Bearman, Th.

In art The Flight into Egypt (top), depicted on Moone High Cross, Ireland (10th century) The Flight into Egypt was a popular subject in art, showing Mary with the baby on a donkey, led by Joseph, borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine Journey to Bethlehem. Nevertheless, Joseph is sometimes holding the child on his shoulders.Terrier Aliferis, L., \\"Joseph christophore dans la Fuite en Egypte\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, 2016 Before about 1525, it usually formed part of a larger cycle, whether of the Nativity, or the Life of Christ or Life of the Virgin. Russian icon of the Flight into Egypt; the bottom section shows the idols of Egypt miraculously falling down before Jesus and being smashed (17th century). From the 15th century in the Netherlands onwards, the non- Biblical subject of the Holy Family resting on the journey, the Rest on the Flight into Egypt became popular, by the late 16th century perhaps more common that the original travelling family. The family were often accompanied by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent James the Brother of the Lord, interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage.The subject only emerges in the second half of the fourteenth century. In some Orthodox traditions the older boy is the one who protects Joseph from the \\"shepherd-tempter\\" in the main Nativity scene. G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I,1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p. 124 , . The background to these scenes usually (until the Council of Trent tightened up on such additions to scripture) included a number of apocryphal miracles, and gave an opportunity for the emerging genre of landscape painting. In the Miracle of the corn, the pursuing soldiers interrogated peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully said it was when they were sowing their wheat seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the Miracle of the idol a pagan statue fell from its plinth as the infant Jesus passed by, and a spring gushed up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In other less commonly seen legends, a group of robbers abandoned their plan to rob the travellers, and a date palm tree bent down to allow them to pluck the fruit.Schiller:117‚Äì123. The date palm incident is also in the Quran. There are two different falling statue legends, one related to the arrival of the family at the Egyptian city of Sotina, and the other usually shown in open country. Sometimes both are shown. During the 16th century, as interest in landscape painting grew, the subject became popular as an individual subject for paintings, often with the figures small in a large landscape. The subject was especially popular with German Romantic painters, and later in the 19th century was one of a number of New Testament subjects which lent themselves to Orientalist treatment. Unusually, the 18th century artist Gianbattista Tiepolo produced a whole series of etchings with 24 scenes from the flight, most just showing different views of the Holy Family travelling.Catalogued as Baudi di Vesme nos 1‚Äì27 (with three plates of frontispiece etc) Flight Into Egypt, by Henry Ossawa Tanner, 1923 A subject taking place after the arrival in Egypt is the meeting of the infant Jesus with his cousin, the infant John the Baptist, who, according to legend was rescued from Bethlehem before the massacre by the Archangel Uriel, and joined the Holy Family in Egypt. This meeting of the two Holy Children was to be painted by many artists during the Renaissance period, after being popularized by Leonardo da Vinci and then Raphael with works like Leonardo's Virgin of the Rocks. The \\"Flight into Egypt\\" was a favorite theme of Henry Ossawa Tanner, depicting the Holy Family's clandestine evasion of King Herod's assassins (Matthew 2:12‚Äì14). In it Tanner expresses his sensitivity to issues of personal freedom, escape from persecution, and migrations of African-Americans from the South to the North.Flight into Egypt, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Metropolitan Museum of Art Two plays of the medieval Ordo Rachelis cycle contain an account of the flight into Egypt, and the one found in the Fleury Playbook contains the only dramatic representation of the return from Egypt. The oratorio L'enfance du Christ (1854) by French composer Hector Berlioz relates the events from Herod's dream and his meeting with the Magi through the angels' warning and the flight into Egypt until the Holy Family arrive at Sais.

Nazareth, now a town, is not mentioned by the Old Testament, Josephus or rabbinical sources,Perkins, P. (1996). Nazareth. In P. J. Achtemeier (Ed.), The HarperCollins Bible dictionary, pp. 741‚Äì742. San Francisco: HarperCollins. . though many Christian Bible archaeologists, such as the evangelical and egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, state that they are fairly sure that a village existed in the area at the time of Jesus.Galilee . Clarke notes that the location of Nazareth is just to the north of where the large town Sepphoris was located. At the time, Sepphoris had been largely destroyed in the violence following the death of Herod the Great, and was being rebuilt by Herod Antipas, hence Clarke speculates that this could have been seen as a good source of employment by Joseph, a carpenter. The difficulty with the brief quote he will be called a Nazarene is that it occurs nowhere in the Old Testament, or any other extant source. The most similar known passage is Judges where of Samson it says the child shall be a Nazirite, where a nazirite was a specific type of religious ascetic. That the Nazirite and Nazareth are so similar in name, while Nazareth isn't mentioned in any other source until after the Gospels have been written, and that the passage almost parallels one about the birth of a hero who was a Nazirite, has led many to propose that Matthew originally had Jesus being a Nazirite, but it was changed to Nazarene, inventing a location named Nazareth, when the ascetic requirements fell foul of later religious practices. Biblical scholar R. T. France rejects this explanation, stating that Jesus was not a Nazirite and claiming that he is never described as one. Another theory is that it is based on a prophecy at , which states there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: ‚Äî the Hebrew for branch is ◊†◊¶◊® (netzer). The priestly clan of the \\"netzerites\\" possibly settled in the place which became known as Netzereth/ Nazareth. Bargil PixnerBargil Pixner in his work \\"With Jesus Through Galilee\\" says that the title Nazarene, given to Jesus, alludes not so much to his town of origin as to his royal descent. While this piece of wordplay is meaningless when translated into Greek, Hebrew wordplay is not unknown in Matthew, underlining the opinion that some parts of this gospel were originally written in Hebrew. Rest on the Flight into Egypt by Lucas Cranach the Elder (1504) Christian traditions associated with the Flight into Egypt The Flight into Egypt is one of the listed Seven Sorrows of Mary. A local French tradition states that Saint Aphrodisius, an Egyptian saint who was venerated as the first bishop of B√©ziers, was the man who sheltered the Holy Family when they fled into Egypt.St. Aphrodisius ‚Äì Catholic Online In Coptic Christianity, it is also held that the Holy family visited many areas in Egypt, including Musturud (where there is now the Church of the Virgin Mary), Wadi El Natrun (which has four large monasteries), and Old Cairo,J.

At Al-Ma·π≠ariyyah, then in Heliopolis and now part of Cairo, there is a sycamore tree (and adjacent chapel) that is a 1672 planting replacing an earlier tree under which Mary was said to have rested, or in some versions hidden from pursuers in the hollow trunk, while pious spiders covered the entrance with dense webs.Commons category; tourist info  See also  * Chapel of the Milk Grotto * L'enfance du Christ * Massacre of the Innocents * Rest on the Flight into Egypt (Caravaggio) * Saint Joseph's dreams References Further reading *Albright, W.F. and C.S.

Onset of symptoms is usually between 5 and 10 years of age. Often, it is autosomal recessive. It is the most common form of a group of disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Although Batten disease is usually regarded as the juvenile form of NCL (or \\"type 3\\"), some physicians use the term Batten disease to describe all forms of NCL. Historically, the NCLs were classified by age of disease onset as infantile NCL (INCL), late infantile NCL (LINCL), juvenile NCL (JNCL) or adult NCL (ANCL). At least 20 genes have been identified in association with Batten disease, but juvenile NCL, the most prevalent form of Batten disease, has been linked to mutations in the CLN3 gene.It was first described in 1903. Signs and symptoms Early signs and symptoms of the disorder usually appear around ages 2‚Äì10, with gradual onset of vision problems or seizures. Early signs may be subtle personality and behavioral changes, slow learning or regression, repetitive speech or echolalia, clumsiness or stumbling. Slowing head growth in the infantile form, poor circulation in lower extremities (legs and feet), decreased body fat and muscle mass, curvature of the spine, hyperventilation and/or breath-holding spells, teeth grinding and constipation may occur. Over time, affected children suffer mental impairment, worsening seizures and progressive loss of sight, speech and motor skills. Batten disease is a terminal disease; life expectancy varies depending on the type or variation. Females with juvenile Batten disease show first symptoms a year later than males, but on average die a year sooner. Cause NCLs are a family of diseases that are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Collectively referred to as Batten disease, NCLs are responsible for most paediatric neurodegenerative diseases. The specific type of NCL is characterized by the age of symptomatic onset and genetic mutation involved. Currently, mutations in ten genes are believed to lead to the development of Batten disease; 'the incidence is as high as one in 12,500 live births'. autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.255x255px = NCL diseases = * Infantile neuronal ceroid (INCL): CLN1 encodes for the protein PPT1 which functions as a lysosomal enzyme. * Late infantile NCL (LINCL): CLN2 encodes for the protein TPP1 which serves as a lysosomal enzyme. Life expectancy is between eight and twelve years of age. * Juvenile NCL (JNCL): CLN3 encodes for CLN3, a lysosomal transmembrane protein. * Adult NCL: CLN4 has no known associated protein. * Finnish variant of late infantile NCL (fLINCL): CLN5 encodes for CLN5, a soluble lysosomal protein. * Variant of the late infantile NCL: CLN6 encodes for the protein CLN6, which serves as a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. * Turkish variant of late infantile NCL: CLN7 or MFSD8, encodes for MFSD8, which functions as a lysosomal transmembrane protein. * Northern epilepsy: CLN8 encodes for CLN8, a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. * Late infantile NCL: CLN10 or CTSD encodes for CTSD, which is a lysosomal protein which a variety of functions. * Infantile osteopetrosis: CLCN7 encodes for CLCN7. = Juvenile NCL: CLN3 mutation = The CLN3 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 at gene position 12.1 (16p12.1), and mutations within this gene are the major cause of juvenile NCL. More specifically, 73% of Batten disease cases are due to a 1.02-kb deletion within this gene, CLN3, which causes a frameshift which produces a truncated mutant gene product of only 181 amino acids in length when compared to the wild-type gene product of 438 amino acids in length. Normal-functioning CLN3 encodes for a hydrophobic transmembrane protein that is mainly localized to the lysosome; however, the 181 amino acid mutant gene product was instead found to primarily localize to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The precise function of the CLN3 gene product remains unknown. Diagnosis Batten disease is rare; misdiagnosis may lead to increased medical expenses, family stress, and the chance of using incorrect forms of treatment, which may exacerbate the patient's condition. Nevertheless, Batten disease can be diagnosed if properly detected. Vision impairment is the most common observable symptom of the disease. Occurrences in children are more prevalent than occurrences in adolescents or adults. Children or adults suspected of having Batten disease should initially see an optometrist or ophthalmologist. A fundus eye examination that aids in the detection of common vision impairment abnormalities, such as granularity of the retinal pigment epithelium in the central macula will be performed. Though it is also seen in a variety of other diseases, a loss of ocular cells is a warning sign of Batten disease. If Batten disease is the suspected diagnosis, a variety of tests is conducted to help accurately confirm the diagnosis, including: * Blood or urine tests can help detect abnormalities that may indicate Batten disease. For example, elevated levels of dolichol in urine have been found in many individuals with NCL. The presence of vacuolated lymphocytes‚Äîwhite blood cells that contain holes or cavities (observed by microscopic analysis of blood smears)‚Äîwhen combined with other findings that indicate NCL, is suggestive for the juvenile form caused by CLN3 mutations. * Skin or tissue sampling is performed by extracting a small piece of tissue, which then is examined under an electron microscope. This can allow physicians to detect typical NCL deposits. These deposits are common in tissues such as skin, muscle, conjunctiva, and rectum. This diagnostic technique is useful, but other invasive tests are more reliable for diagnosing Batten disease. * Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a technique that uses special probes attached on to the individual's scalp. It records electrical currents/signals, which allow medical experts to analyze electrical pattern activity in the brain. EEG assists in observing if the patient has seizures. * Electrical studies of the eyes are used, because as mentioned, vision loss is the most common characteristic of Batten disease. Visual-evoked responses and electroretinograms are effective tests for detecting various eye conditions common in childhood NCLs. * Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are diagnostic imaging tests that allow physicians to better visualize the appearance of the brain. MRI imaging test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to help create images of the brain. CT scan uses x-rays and computers to create a detailed image of the brain's tissues and structures. Both diagnostic imaging tests can help reveal brain areas that are decaying, or atrophic, in persons with NCL. * Measurement of enzyme activity specific to Batten disease may help confirm certain diagnoses caused by different mutations. Elevated levels of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase is involved in CLN1. Acid protease is involved in CLN2. Cathepsin D is involved in CLN10. * DNA analysis can be used to help confirm the diagnosis of Batten disease. When the mutation is known, DNA analysis can also be used to detect unaffected carriers of this condition for genetic counseling. If a family mutation has not previously been identified or if the common mutations are not present, recent molecular advances have made it possible to sequence all of the known NCL genes, increasing the chances of finding the responsible mutation(s). Treatment Batten disease is a terminal illness; the FDA has approved Brineura (cerliponase alfa) as a treatment for a specific form of Batten disease. Brineura is the first FDA-approved treatment to slow loss of walking ability (ambulation) in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. Palliative treatment is symptomatic and supportive. One drug, an antisense oligonucleotide, milasen, described in The New England Journal of Medicine, is believed to be the first ‚Äúcustom‚Äù treatment for a genetic disease. It is named after Mila Makovec, the only patient who may ever take it. (It could help another exceedingly rare patient who has the same mutation as Mila.) History Batten disease is named after the British pediatrician Frederick Batten, who first described it in 1903. Also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sj√∂gren-Batten disease, it is the most common form of a group of disorders called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Although Batten disease is usually regarded as the juvenile form of NCL, some physicians use the term Batten disease to describe all forms of NCL. Research Pickering, Ontario, Canada, dedicated to the children who have lost or will lose their lives to Batten disease In June 1987, a phase-I clinical trial was launched at Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University to study a gene therapy method for treatment of the signs and symptoms of LINCL. The experimental drug works by delivering a gene transfer vector called AAV2CUhCLN2 to the brain. Although the trial is not matched, randomized, or blinded and lacked a contemporaneous placebo/sham control group, assessment of the primary outcome variable suggests a slowing of progression of LINCL in the treated children. Researchers believe the neurological deficits common in JNCL could be due to overactive AMPA receptors in the cerebellum. To test this hypothesis, researchers administered AMPA antagonist drugs into affected mice. The motor skills of the affected mice showed significant improvement after the antagonist treatment, which supported the hypothesis that the neurological deficits in JNCL are due to overactive AMPA receptors. This research could eventually help to alleviate neurological deficits of JNCL in humans. In November 2006, after receiving FDA clearance, neurosurgeon Nathan Selden, pediatrician Bob Steiner, and colleagues at Doernbecher Children's Hospital at Oregon Health and Science University began a clinical study in which purified neural stem cells were injected into the brain of Daniel Kerner, a six-year-old child with Batten disease, who had lost the ability to walk and talk. This patient was the first of six to receive the injection of a stem cell product from StemCells Inc., a Palo Alto biotech company. These are believed to be the first-ever transplants of fetal stem cells into the human brain.\\"A stem cell first at OHSU \\" The Portland Tribune, Nov 24, 2006 By early December, the child had recovered well enough to return home, and some signs of speech returning were reported.http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17888&ch;=biotech The main goal of phase-I clinical trials, however, was to investigate the safety of transplantation. Overall, the phase-I data demonstrated that high doses of human neural stem cells, delivered by a direct transplantation procedure into multiple sites within the brain, followed by 12 months of immunosuppression, were well tolerated by all six patients enrolled in the trial. The patients‚Äô medical, neurological, and neuropsychological conditions, following transplantation, appeared consistent with the normal course of the disease. Daniel Kerner died on August 20th, 2009. In 2010, Cherie and Jim Flores donated $2 million, the biggest gift in Batten disease research history, and the Beyond Batten Disease Foundation contributed $500,000 to establish laboratories for Italian researchers Drs. Ballabio, Sardiello and their colleagues at the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute of Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital.[14] During 2011, the first controlled clinical trials began with the University of Rochester for a treatment for Batten Disease.[15] The trial included 30 patients who were experiencing signs of the disease in the hope of slowing its progress. In November 2013, Weill Medical College of Cornell University began recruiting participants for a safety study of a gene transfer vector,[16] described as a non-randomised safety and efficacy trial. As part of a trial began by University of Rochester in March 2014. Mycophenolate mofetil is being tested to determine its efficacy and safety using a gene transfer vector. In complex diseases such as Batten, therapies that address multiple aspects of the disease at the same time have the potential for higher impact than those focusing on one aspect.‚ÄúThe use of several treatment strategies might offer additional benefits to patients with neurodegenerative disease, but the benefits of this approach must be weighed carefully against the additional adverse effects that combined treatments might bring,‚Äù the researchers wrote. The medical team also noted that ‚Äúover the past two decades, scientists and clinicians within the Batten disease community have worked to ensure that tools are in place to enable progress towards effective treatments at an unprecedented pace. ‚ÄùRecent progress in Batten disease research offers hope that efficient and targeted therapies will be available soon, the researchers said, noting that the ‚ÄúBatten disease research community is becoming a model of how effective, efficient rare disease research can be accomplished by working together.‚Äù One drug, an antisense oligonucleotide, milasen[10], described in The New England Journal of Medicine[11], is believed to be the first ‚Äúcustom‚Äù treatment for a genetic disease. It is named after the patient for who it was designed and the only person who may ever take it, Mila Makovec, who has Batten CLN7.

The structure shown here for DHA is the commonly shown textbook structure. This 1,2,3-tricarbonyl is too electrophilic to survive more than a few milliseconds in aqueous solution, however. The actual structure shown by spectroscopic studies is the result of rapid hemiacetal formation between the 6-OH and the 3-carbonyl groups. Hydration of the 2-carbonyl is also observed. The lifetime of the stabilized species is commonly said to be about 6 minutes under biological conditions. Destruction results from irreversible hydrolysis of the ester bond, with additional degradation reactions following. Crystallization of solutions of DHA gives a pentacyclic dimer structure of indefinite stability. Recycling of ascorbate via active transport of DHA into cells, followed by reduction and reuse, mitigates the inability of humans to synthesize it from glucose. Hydration equilibria of DHA - the hemiacetal structure (center) is the predominant one. =Transport to mitochondria= Vitamin C accumulates in mitochondria, where most of the free radicals are produced, by entering as DHA through the glucose transporters, GLUT10. Ascorbic acid protects the mitochondrial genome and membrane. =Transport to the brain= Vitamin C does not pass from the bloodstream into the brain, although the brain is one of the organs that have the greatest concentration of vitamin C. Instead, DHA is transported through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier via GLUT1 transporters, and then converted back to ascorbate. Use Dehydroascorbic acid has been used as a vitamin C dietary supplement.

The film is set in New York City. The plot embodies a punk rock ethic of misunderstood youth articulating their frustrations toward adult authority through music. Plot Nicky Marotta (Robin Johnson) and Pamela Pearl (Trini Alvarado) are two teenage girls who meet in the New York Neurological Hospital, where they're both being examined for mental illness. Pamela is depressed and insecure, and she's neglected and exploited by her father, David Pearl (Peter Coffield), a prominent and wealthy commissioner running a campaign to \\"clean up\\" Times Square. Nicky is a tough-talking street kid with musical aspirations, sent to the hospital for an evaluation after an altercation with police. Sharing a room, the brash Nicky and shy Pamela become friends. Nicky admires Pamela's poetic spirit; Pamela admires Nicky's forthright attitude and resents the condescending way in which the doctors treat her. Nicky is released from the hospital and later returns, ostensibly for an appointment with her social worker, Rosie Washington (Anna Maria Horsford), but really to break Pamela out. Both girls escape the hospital, steal an ambulance, and hide out in abandoned warehouse on the Chelsea Piers, making a pact to scream out each other's names in times of trouble. There is a citywide search for Pamela after David reports her missing and accuses Nicky of kidnapping her, claiming Pamela needs medical attention. Meanwhile, the girls try to eke out a living by engaging in card games, petty theft, odd jobs, and scavenging. Radio disc jockey Johnny LaGuardia (Tim Curry), who broadcasts from a penthouse studio overlooking Times Square, realizes that David's missing daughter is the same \\"Zombie Girl\\" who sent him letters, telling him how sad and insecure she feels. LaGuardia, who resents David's \\"Reclaim Rebuild Restore\\" campaign to gentrify Times Square, uses his radio station, WJAD, to reach out to Nicky and Pamela. The girls start writing songs together and form an underground punk rock band, The Sleez Sisters, with the help of LaGuardia, who sees them as an opportunity to undermine David. When an open letter to Pamela from Rosie is printed in the newspaper (with the help of David), calling Nicky troubled and dangerous, the girls perform a defiant Sleez Sisters song live on WJAD, making them even more famous. As an act of further rebellion, Nicky and Pamela also throw TVs off a series of rooftops in the city. The two eventually have a falling out when they realize that their lives are on divergent paths. Pamela is content with her newfound sense of identity and wants to return home. Nicky wants to continue with The Sleez Sisters and becomes jealous of Pamela's relationship with LaGuardia. One night, she accuses LaGuardia of exploiting Pamela and herself, and throws them both out of the warehouse hideout. She then has a breakdown, wrecking her home and destroying the journal she shared with Pamela. After a failed attempt to drown herself, she drunkenly breaks into WJAD and demands that LaGuardia put her on the air (though, unbeknownst to Nicky, he never does). Midway through her song, Nicky breaks down and asks Pamela for help, shouting out her name. A sympathetic LaGuardia takes Pamela to Nicky. Pamela, breaking ties with LaGuardia, then takes Nicky to David's office, located in the middle of Times Square. Pamela calls all the local radio stations, announcing an impromptu, and illegal, midnight show in Times Square, on the rooftop of a 42nd Street grindhouse. A message is sent out to the fans of The Sleez Sisters, inviting them to attend the concert. Nicky says, \\"If they treat you like garbage, put on a garbage bag. If they treat you like a bandit, black out your eyes!\\" Girls across the city heed Nicky's call and board buses and subways to converge in Times Square. In a garbage-bag costume and bandit-mask-style makeup, Nicky sings on the marquee roof above a crowd of cheering fans, also in garbage bags with \\"bandit\\" makeup. With the police approaching from behind, Nicky jumps off the edge of the marquee and into a blanket held taut by a group of fans. Camouflaged in the crowd, Nicky manages to evade capture by the police. Pamela watches her friend vanish into the night.

Quinn as Simon * Tim Choate as Eastman * Elizabeth Pe√±a as Disco Hostess * Steve James as Dude * Jay Acovone as Plainclothes Cop Production =Development= Times Square was directed by Allan Moyle from a script written by Jacob Brackman, based on a story by Moyle and Leanne Ungar. The movie was inspired by a diary, found in a second-hand couch bought by Moyle, detailing the life on the streets of a young mentally disturbed woman. \\"This girl was burning the candle at both ends,\\" said Moyle. \\"She would go into bars - she was too young - but she would go in anyway and get arrested. She had no intention of reaching the age of 21.\\". . . and reality is Moyle's byword Scott, Jay. The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont. [Toronto, Ont]10 Nov 1979: E.3. According to the DVD commentary, the original title of the project was \\"She's Got the Shakes.\\" Moyle did a script that attracted the interest of Tim Curry. He then arranged for Jacob Brackman to do a rewrite. The script caught the attention of Robert Stigwood, the impresario behind the musical films Saturday Night Fever (1977), Grease (1978), and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1978). Moyle said, \\"I think they had been planning to shoot something this summer that fell through, and I was hysterical about wanting it to be shot, so we made a deal with them. They were very sensitive to the script.\\" =Casting= Although Tim Curry has a supporting role in Times Square (and filmed all his scenes in two days), his familiarity with film audiences ensured that he received top-billing onscreen and in the film's advertising above the two unknown leads, 15-year-old Robin Johnson and 13-year-old Trini Alvarado. Robin Johnson's casting was a bit of a fluke. According to Robin, she was cutting class ‚Äì cutting up ‚Äì and had been approached by some supposed talent scout, claiming she should audition for the film. She had never seen or heard from this man after the one meeting and no one from the film crew knew of him. =Filming= The film went into production with a $6 million budget. Filming started in New York in October 1979. It was meant to be the first of four Stigwood films shot in New York, the others being The Fan, Angel and Stayin' Alive'.At the Movies Buckley, Tom. New York Times 12 Oct 1979: C6. =Post-production= The original cut of Times Square contained lesbian content which was mostly deleted from the final print (which is still a lesbian love story). Moyle revealed in the DVD audio commentary that the film's integrity was compromised by the removal of the more overt lesbian content, and the addition of several \\"inappropriate\\" songs to the film's soundtrack at the insistence of producer Robert Stigwood, who wanted the film to be another Saturday Night Fever and insisted that the soundtrack be a double album to make the film more commercially viable. Allan Moyle and Robin Johnson remarked on the audio commentary that the loss of key scenes made the narrative disjointed, and damaged the story's emotion and characterizations. They also note that the film's focus changes, jarringly, from Pamela to Nicky, and that the increasingly outlandish and unrealistic story undermines the movie's gritty, on-location documentary style. Moyle left production before the film was completed, and other people supervised scenes to accompany the soundtrack additions (for example, the sequence featuring teens preparing to go to the Sleez Sisters' final concert was shot by the film's second unit).FESTIVAL OF FESTIVALS IN PERSON Scott, Jay. The Globe and Mail; 12 Sep 1990: C.6. The version of the film released to theatres was not Moyle's preferred cut; however, he still acknowledges the finished film's importance as it documents a Times Square that mostly no longer exists: the film was shot on location and captured Times Square's seedy, grindhouse atmosphere before it was cleaned up in the mid-1990s. Release The film was advertised with the taglines \\"In the heart of Times Square, a poor girl becomes famous, a rich girl becomes courageous, and both become friends\\" and \\"TIMES SQUARE is the music of the streets.\\" Reaction Upon its original theatrical release, Times Square was not a commercial or critical success. Reviewing the film, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"Times Square rarely comes together into anything more than a good idea that fails, but there are times when it seems on the brink of wonderful things. Of all the bad movies I've seen recently, this is the one that projects the real sense of a missed opportunity - of potential achievement gone wrong. The problem may be with the screenplay. This is a movie that knows who its characters are, but doesn't seem sure about what they're doing.\\" Other reviews of the film were generally negative, although Robin Johnson's performance was frequently singled out for praise. Johnson, in fact, signed an exclusive three-year contract with the Robert Stigwood Organization, with the understanding that RSO would develop film and music projects for her. RSO intended to market Johnson as \\"the female John Travolta,\\" and her contract legally barred her from accepting offers or auditions from rival companies. Johnson therefore turned down calls from agents, producers and casting directors, but the projects RSO promised her never came to fruition. Johnson took a job as a bank teller whilst waiting for her RSO contract to expire, and by the time it did, there were no offers for work. Johnson did some minor film and TV roles, but by the late 1980s, she gave up on acting and got a job as a traffic reporter on a Los Angeles radio station. Moyle later said he \\"had a rotten time,\\" on the film . \\"And I just figured I wasn't combative enough to be a director.\\"He's Up, He's Down, He's Up Again After a rocky year, Christian Slater regains his footing with the new teen Angst tale, \\"Pump Up the Volume\\" Goldstein, Patrick. Los Angeles Times 19 Aug 1990: 27. He did not direct again for a decade. =Cult reputation= Over the years since its original release, Times Square has been rediscovered and become a staple at gay and lesbian film festivals, because of the aforementioned, subtly-portrayed lesbian relationship between the film's two female leads. Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre cites this as one of her favorite films. Welsh rock group Manic Street Preachers covered the Times Square song \\"Damn Dog\\" on their debut album Generation Terrorists (1992) and quoted dialogue from the film in the album liner notes (\\"Damn Dog\\" was, however, excluded from the American release of the album). The Manics also titled their song \\"Roses in the Hospital\\" (from their second album, 1993's Gold Against the Soul) after Pamela's line, \\"What about the roses in the hospital?\\" (alluding to the scene in which Nicky eats roses to distract Pamela from the doctors and her father). In concerts and publicity shots in 1993, Manics bassist Nicky Wire often wore bankrobber-mask-style makeup, as Nicky Marotta does in the film. Home video The movie was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2000. Extra features on this DVD include audio commentary by director/co-writer Allan Moyle and star Robin Johnson, and the film's original theatrical trailer. Allan Moyle has stated that a director's cut of Times Square is unlikely to ever surface because the footage needed for its restoration is missing. Kino Lorber is set to release the film on Blu-ray in 2020 from a 4k remaster.  Soundtrack  The film's release was accompanied by a double album soundtrack of punk rock and new wave music. The soundtrack comprises pre-existing songs as well as original songs commissioned for the film, and features a wide range of artists including The Ramones, The Cure, XTC, Lou Reed, Gary Numan, Talking Heads, Garland Jeffreys, Joe Jackson, Suzi Quatro, Roxy Music, Patti Smith and The Pretenders. The Suzi Quatro track, \\"Rock Hard,\\" is identified in the film as being Nicky and Pamela's favorite record. The disco song \\"Help Me!\\", which plays over the film's closing scene, is a duet between Robin Gibb (of The Bee Gees) and Marcy Levy, and was one of the songs added to the film without the consent of Allan Moyle. The song \\"Down in the Park\\" is credited as being performed by Gary Numan although, technically, it was recorded when Numan was using the band name Tubeway Army. The version of \\"Down in the Park\\" included on the Times Square soundtrack is not the album/single version from Replicas (1979), but an earlier version of the song that would later be released on Numan's Replicas Redux (2008). The soundtrack also features original songs sung by the film's actors, \\"Damn Dog\\" by Johnson, \\"Your Daughter is One\\" by Johnson and Alvarado, and \\"Flowers of the City\\" by Johnson and David Johansen. The song \\"Dangerous Type\\" by The Cars features in the film, but was not included on the soundtrack. As a compilation of some of the most important New Wave and punk music from the era, the Times Square soundtrack achieved far more notoriety than the film did on its release. It also became a collectors' item among fans of XTC, because it included the specially-written XTC track \\"Take This Town\\", which for many years was only available on this soundtrack. In his audio commentary for the Times Square DVD, Allan Moyle mentions that David Bowie was commissioned to provide a song for the movie's soundtrack, but Bowie's label at that time wouldn't let the filmmakers use it. (At the time, Bowie was still under contract with RCA Victor Records, and the Times Square album was issued by RSO Records, at the time distributed by RCA Victor competitor PolyGram; however, it's notable that Lou Reed, who does appear on the album, was also under contract to RCA Victor.) Desmond Child has mentioned in a magazine interview that he collaborated with David Bowie on the song \\"The Night Was Not\\" (the song did appear on the Times Square soundtrack, performed by Child's band, Desmond Child & Rouge). Another rumour is that Bowie intended to provide a re-recorded version of his 1971 song \\"Life on Mars?\\" for the Times Square soundtrack.http://www.robinjohnson.net/commentary.html References External links  Category:1980 films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American films Category:1980 LGBT-related films Category:Riot grrrl films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Punk films Category:English-language films Category:American teen drama films Category:1980s teen drama films Category:Films directed by Allan Moyle Category:Films produced by Robert Stigwood Category:EMI Films films Category:1980 drama films ","title":"Times Square (1980 film)"},{"id":"2154544","text":"Indian mythology may refer to: *Hindu mythology **Vedic mythology *Kanglei mythology *Mythology of Jainism *Buddhist mythology *Mythology of Sikhism *Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas See also *Indian religions *Native American religion ","title":"Indian mythology"},{"id":"2154546","text":"The Clark County Regional Flood Control District (CCRFCD) was created in 1985 by the Nevada Legislature allowing Clark County to provide broad solutions to flooding problems. The District has developed plans and so far successfully continued working on a 50-year program to eliminate most flooding from a 100-year flood in the populated areas for which the CCRFCD is responsible. History Voters in 1986 approved a quarter cent sales tax to fund construction of regional flood control facilities. The first project began in 1988. As of June 2013, a total of $1.7 bill was spent on flood control, including construction of 90 detention basins and approximately 581 miles of channels and underground storm drains. To date, 51 square miles have been removed from federally identified FEMA flood zones, saving residents millions of dollars per year in flood insurance premiums. The Regional Flood Control District is more than 75 percent complete with the Master Plan. Another 31 detention basins are planned, along with 226 miles of conveyance. The District's website, provides citizens information about the District and the progress of flood control in Clark County. The site also gives current rainfall information on approximately 189 locations throughout the county. The District produces a 30-minute television news program six times per year that updates the community about the progress of flood control and provides information about flash flood safety. The program airs about 40 times per month on Cox Cable channels 2 and 4, as well as on stations in Laughlin and Mesquite. District direction for providing protection Since Las Vegas is located in a basin with a single outlet, the Las Vegas Wash, all rain runoff drains to the east side of the basin where it will eventually be deposited into Lake Mead. Rainfall in the surrounding mountain ranges, can cause flooding in the area as water flows off the mountains onto the valley floor. The area is also subject to localized weather events. It is possible for an area to receive heavy rainfall in a short time, while nearby areas as close as one or two miles (3 km) away receive little or no rain. Additional history about past flood events is available as well as some historical rainfall data. The increase of hardscape as the valley has developed has contributed to an increase of runoff over time. To help alleviate the damage caused by flooding, the Clark County Regional Flood Control District has spent millions of dollars to build detention basins and concrete drainage channels throughout the area. The belief is that these structures will control the flow of water when there is storm runoff and reduce flooding in areas below the basins and near the channels and washes. The detention basins operated by the district vary in size from and are up to deep. Given the topography of the area, some areas may not be fixable. One example being the Flamingo Wash where the channel overflows into the Imperial Palace parking garage during flash flooding events. How growth has affected plans and development With the rapid growth occurring in the valley, the plan and finances have not been able to keep up. As a result, developers are deciding to build in areas not yet protected by detention basins or other control measures. This is causing many new home buyers to deal with damage or severe runoff on local streets which are used as flood channels when other facilities are not available. How weather creates problems Heavy rainfall can cause localized flash flooding. A thunderstorm hit the northwest part of the city of Las Vegas for two hours in August 2003, causing some hail damage and considerable water damage. Heavy localized flooding occurred, with property damage reaching into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In February 2005, the southwest part of the Vegas Valley was hard hit by flooding from the mountain rainfall runoff. Higher than average precipitation that same winter was responsible for significant damage in Mesquite and Overton which, as of that point in time, had not received much attention since their populations were so much smaller than the Las Vegas valley area. Event detection and notification In addition to building and maintaining flood control projects, the District also operates a Flood Threat Recognition System of ALERT rain and stream gage, with the cooperation of the United States Geological Survey and the National Weather Service. This system collects hydrometeorologic data primarily for the purpose of detecting situations which could cause flooding.

Description This runestone consists of a runic inscription on two sides with the text within a serpent and a cross at the top. The runestone was moved from Rasbo to Uppsala in the 17th century. In 1867 this runestone, along with U 489 and U 896, was exhibited in the Exposition Universelle in Paris. It was dropped in Le Havre during its return. After having lain there for several decades, it was returned to Uppsala. It now stands in the Universitetsparken (the University Park) close to the main building of Uppsala University. This is an unusual runestone in that its sponsor, Vigmund, raised it in honor of himself. There are over twenty other runestones where the sponsor stated that the stone was raised in memory of himself, including S√∂ 55 in Bjudby, U 127 in Danderyds, the now-lost U 149 in Hagby, U 164 and U 165 in T√§by, U 171 in S√∂derby, U 194 in V√§sby, U 212 in Vallentuna, U 261 in Fresta, U 308 in Ekeby, the now-lost U 345 in Ytterg√§rde, U 433 in Husby-√Ñrlinghundra, U 734 in Linsunda, U 739 in G√•di, U 803 in L√•ngtora, U 962 in Vaksala, U 1040 in Fasma, the now-lost U 1114 in Myrby, U 1181 in Lilla Runh√§llen, U Fv1958;250 in Sigtuna, Vs 17 in R√•by, Vs 32 in Pr√§stg√•rden, and DR 212 in Tillitse. Of these, five stones known as the Jarlabanke Runestones were sponsored by the same person in memory of himself. The inscription is carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. Similar the inscription on U 1016, this runic inscription uses the term st√Ωrimanns or st√Ωrima√∞r as a title that is translated as \\"captain.\\" Other runestones use this term apparently to describe working as a steersman on a ship. Other inscriptions using this title include S√∂ 161 in R√•by, U 1016 in Fjuckby, U Fv1976;104 at the Uppsala Cathedral, and DR 1 in Hedeby. pp. 104-106. The Norse word s√°l for soul in the prayer was imported from English and was first recorded as being used during the tenth century.

TechReport's \\"About Us\\" page. August 8, 2009. The Tech Report used to specialize in hardware as well as producing quarterly system build guides TechReport's Summer 2009 System Guide. June 25, 2009. at various price points, and occasional price vs. performance scatter plots. The value proposition June 9, 2009 Tech Report also has an online community and used to have an active podcast. Some of the site's investigative articles regarding hardware benchmarking have been cited by other technology news sites like Anandtech and PC World. The site went through ownership change and major redesign in middle of 2019 after which the site's focus and content went through significant changes, no longer specializing in hardware or producing any system guides, podcasts and no longer being focused on computer technology.  History  Tech Report was founded by Scott 'Damage' Wasson, a Harvard Divinity School graduate, and Andy 'Dr. Evil' Brown. Both started by writing at Ars Technica in 1998. The two later decided to launch their own website. The site eventually grew into a business enterprise with multiple full-time staff members, and continues in that form today. Tech Report was originally located at tech-report.com in 1999. The site was moved to techreport.com in 2003., 'Whois.net data for tech-report.com'. September 7, 2008. On August 20, 2007 a beta for a new site design was posted in the forums for review by the user community. It has since been moved to live. Launching on January 1, 2011, the new site design, TR 3.0 rolled out. Offering a completely new layout and two user switchable colors, blue and white. On December 2, 2015 Scott Wasson, the founder and Editor-In-Chief stepped down as he accepted a role in AMD's graphics division. Wasson subsequently sold the company in March 2018 to Adam Eiberger, the Tech Report's business manager. On December 21, 2018 Jeff Kampman stepped down as Editor-In-Chief. On July 7, 2019, coinciding with the release of AMD's Ryzen 3 CPUs and Navi GPUs, a site redesign was launched moving from the Tech Report's former custom CMS and functionality to a Wordpress template. On July 9th, Renee Johnson posted an introduction to the design. The new redesign was met with criticism from the users. In August of same year, TechReport staff has removed all mention of former Editor-in-Chief Jeff Kampman (according to Jeff it was by his own request) as contributor and replaced his name with Renee Johnson on all articles he contributed going back to 2014. His \\"farewell\\" message that he posted on December 21 of 2018 was also deleted from the site. The TechReport \\"About\\" page was also edited and all information about original founders was removed. The focus of the site has also changed from focus on hardware news, reviews and system guides to product promotion articles disguised as \\"reviews\\" without using actual products or providing benchmark data for them and to articles such as \\"here are X ways of making your Y better\\" which have nothing to do with hardware, software or any culture related to those topics.  AMD TLB bug investigation  TechReport was one of the first sites in 2007 to document and benchmark the flaw in the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) of AMD Phenom CPUs. Despite claims by AMD that the initial BIOS fix would only result in 10% performance decrease, benchmarks by TechReport have revealed that the performance impact by the initial BIOS fix was much more severe, up to nearly 20% on average, with some applications such as Firefox experiencing performance decrease of 57% in tests. They were also the first one to notify about AMD stopping the shipment of processors due to this bug.  Video game and GPU performance benchmarking research  On September 8, 2011 Scott Wasson posted an article titled \\"Inside the second: A new look at game benchmarking\\". This showed gamers that frames per second(FPS) are not the only thing that matters in \\"smooth\\" gameplay, but frame latency has a big part. This innovative benchmarking method was later mentioned and acknowledged by other publications such as Anandtech, which described this method as \\"a revolution in the 3D game benchmarking scene\\" and Overclockers.  SSD Endurance Experiment  In 2013, TechReport has started an experiment using several SSD drives to determine how many writes they can endure. This test has lasted for more than 18 months before all drives used in this test have failed, enduring much larger amount of written data than rated by manufacturers themselves, and even prompting one of the manufacturers, Samsung, to release a humorous music video dedicated to this test.  Site Structure  = Main Page = A large portion of the main page is dedicated to \\"News\\" and \\"Blog\\" entries. Among the news entries were \\"Shortbread\\" posts which used to offer a summary breakdown of reviews and news offered by other sites. Featured articles were often reviews of newly released PC hardware which has been tested by the site's editors and judged on a number of metrics including performance and value compared to other available hardware. After the takeover of the site by new owners and major changes the \\"Shortbread\\" posts are rarely being made and \\"reviews\\" consist of products being presented for advertising purposes through referral links without actual review of those products by the site editors. = Podcast = Adapting to the general trend of more content for digest, The Tech Report launched their own podcast on February 9, 2008 hosted by Jordan Drake. While the schedule has varied it provides a casual but quite in-depth look back at the topics that made news from a panel of the site staff. Subsequent to 2015 episodes were released irregularly, frequently discussing the release of a new microarchitecture with David Kanter of Real World Technologies. Last podcast was made in January of 2018 and no more podcasts were made since then. = Community and Forum = Tech Report has a phpBB- styled forum that is unrestricted in read-only form and open to the public for contribution via simple registration. The forum is primarily structured around computer technology and related topics, but debates also range from politics and religion in the \\"opt-in only\\" R&P; forum to general random chatter in the Back Porch. Contributors to the website also have access to a restricted forum called the Smoky Back Room. Registered users may respond to news topics and other entries posted on the front page in an isolated threaded comments section that automatically attaches to each new entry. Although access to the main page comments is linked into the user database, the discussions are logged separately from the forum area of the site and are not counted toward the user forum statistics.

Imperial College Press, 2007, Given that the subject is one that has only emerged very recently, bionanotechnology and nanobiotechnology serve as blanket terms for various related technologies. This discipline helps to indicate the merger of biological research with various fields of nanotechnology. Concepts that are enhanced through nanobiology include: nanodevices (such as biological machines), nanoparticles, and nanoscale phenomena that occurs within the discipline of nanotechnology. This technical approach to biology allows scientists to imagine and create systems that can be used for biological research. Biologically inspired nanotechnology uses biological systems as the inspirations for technologies not yet created. However, as with nanotechnology and biotechnology, bionanotechnology does have many potential ethical issues associated with it. A ribosome is a biological machine. The most important objectives that are frequently found in nanobiology involve applying nanotools to relevant medical/biological problems and refining these applications. Developing new tools, such as peptoid nanosheets, for medical and biological purposes is another primary objective in nanotechnology. New nanotools are often made by refining the applications of the nanotools that are already being used. The imaging of native biomolecules, biological membranes, and tissues is also a major topic for nanobiology researchers. Other topics concerning nanobiology include the use of cantilever array sensors and the application of nanophotonics for manipulating molecular processes in living cells. Recently, the use of microorganisms to synthesize functional nanoparticles has been of great interest. Microorganisms can change the oxidation state of metals. These microbial processes have opened up new opportunities for us to explore novel applications, for example, the biosynthesis of metal nanomaterials. In contrast to chemical and physical methods, microbial processes for synthesizing nanomaterials can be achieved in aqueous phase under gentle and environmentally benign conditions. This approach has become an attractive focus in current green bionanotechnology research towards sustainable development. Terminology The terms are often used interchangeably. When a distinction is intended, though, it is based on whether the focus is on applying biological ideas or on studying biology with nanotechnology. Bionanotechnology generally refers to the study of how the goals of nanotechnology can be guided by studying how biological \\"machines\\" work and adapting these biological motifs into improving existing nanotechnologies or creating new ones.Bionanotechnology - Definition, wordiQ.comNolting B, ‚ÄúBiophysical Nanotechnology‚Äù. In: ‚ÄúMethods in Modern Biophysics‚Äù, Springer, 2005, Nanobiotechnology, on the other hand, refers to the ways that nanotechnology is used to create devices to study biological systems.NBTC Homepage  Nanobiotechnology Center In other words, nanobiotechnology is essentially miniaturized biotechnology, whereas bionanotechnology is a specific application of nanotechnology. For example, DNA nanotechnology or cellular engineering would be classified as bionanotechnology because they involve working with biomolecules on the nanoscale. Conversely, many new medical technologies involving nanoparticles as delivery systems or as sensors would be examples of nanobiotechnology since they involve using nanotechnology to advance the goals of biology. The definitions enumerated above will be utilized whenever a distinction between nanobio and bionano is made in this article. However, given the overlapping usage of the terms in modern parlance, individual technologies may need to be evaluated to determine which term is more fitting. As such, they are best discussed in parallel. Concepts Kinesin walking on a microtubule. It is a molecular biological machine that uses protein domain dynamics on nanoscales Most of the scientific concepts in bionanotechnology are derived from other fields. Biochemical principles that are used to understand the material properties of biological systems are central in bionanotechnology because those same principles are to be used to create new technologies. Material properties and applications studied in bionanoscience include mechanical properties (e.g. deformation, adhesion, failure), electrical/electronic (e.g. electromechanical stimulation, capacitors, energy storage/batteries), optical (e.g. absorption, luminescence, photochemistry), thermal (e.g. thermomutability, thermal management), biological (e.g. how cells interact with nanomaterials, molecular flaws/defects, biosensing, biological mechanisms such as mechanosensation), nanoscience of disease (e.g. genetic disease, cancer, organ/tissue failure), as well as computing (e.g. DNA computing) and agriculture (target delivery of pesticides, hormones and fertilizers. The impact of bionanoscience, achieved through structural and mechanistic analyses of biological processes at nanoscale, is their translation into synthetic and technological applications through nanotechnology. Nanobiotechnology takes most of its fundamentals from nanotechnology. Most of the devices designed for nano-biotechnological use are directly based on other existing nanotechnologies. Nanobiotechnology is often used to describe the overlapping multidisciplinary activities associated with biosensors, particularly where photonics, chemistry, biology, biophysics, nanomedicine, and engineering converge. Measurement in biology using wave guide techniques, such as dual- polarization interferometry, is another example. Applications Applications of bionanotechnology are extremely widespread. Insofar as the distinction holds, nanobiotechnology is much more commonplace in that it simply provides more tools for the study of biology. Bionanotechnology, on the other hand, promises to recreate biological mechanisms and pathways in a form that is useful in other ways. =Nanomedicine= Nanomedicine is a field of medical science whose applications are increasing more and more thanks to nanorobots and biological machines, which constitute a very useful tool to develop this area of knowledge. In the past years, researchers have made many improvements in the different devices and systems required to develop nanorobots. This supposes a new way of treating and dealing with diseases such as cancer; thanks to nanorobots, side effects of chemotherapy have been controlled, reduced and even eliminated, so some years from now, cancer patients will be offered an alternative to treat this disease instead of chemotherapy, which causes secondary effects such as hair loss, fatigue or nausea killing not only cancerous cells but also the healthy ones. At a clinical level, cancer treatment with nanomedicine will consist of the supply of nanorobots to the patient through an injection that will search for cancerous cells while leaving the healthy ones untouched. Patients that will be treated through nanomedicine will not notice the presence of these nanomachines inside them; the only thing that is going to be noticeable is the progressive improvement of their health. Nanobiotechnology is quite important for medicine formulation. It helps a lot in making vaccines as well. =Nanobiotechnology= Nanobiotechnology (sometimes referred to as nanobiology) is best described as helping modern medicine progress from treating symptoms to generating cures and regenerating biological tissues. Three American patients have received whole cultured bladders with the help of doctors who use nanobiology techniques in their practice. Also, it has been demonstrated in animal studies that a uterus can be grown outside the body and then placed in the body in order to produce a baby. Stem cell treatments have been used to fix diseases that are found in the human heart and are in clinical trials in the United States. There is also funding for research into allowing people to have new limbs without having to resort to prosthesis. Artificial proteins might also become available to manufacture without the need for harsh chemicals and expensive machines. It has even been surmised that by the year 2055, computers may be made out of biochemicals and organic salts. Another example of current nanobiotechnological research involves nanospheres coated with fluorescent polymers. Researchers are seeking to design polymers whose fluorescence is quenched when they encounter specific molecules. Different polymers would detect different metabolites. The polymer- coated spheres could become part of new biological assays, and the technology might someday lead to particles which could be introduced into the human body to track down metabolites associated with tumors and other health problems. Another example, from a different perspective, would be evaluation and therapy at the nanoscopic level, i.e. the treatment of Nanobacteria (25-200 nm sized) as is done by NanoBiotech Pharma. While nanobiology is in its infancy, there are a lot of promising methods that will rely on nanobiology in the future. Biological systems are inherently nano in scale; nanoscience must merge with biology in order to deliver biomacromolecules and molecular machines that are similar to nature. Controlling and mimicking the devices and processes that are constructed from molecules is a tremendous challenge to face for the converging disciplines of nanobiotechnology. All living things, including humans, can be considered to be nanofoundries. Natural evolution has optimized the \\"natural\\" form of nanobiology over millions of years. In the 21st century, humans have developed the technology to artificially tap into nanobiology. This process is best described as \\"organic merging with synthetic.\\" Colonies of live neurons can live together on a biochip device; according to research from Dr. Gunther Gross at the University of North Texas. Self-assembling nanotubes have the ability to be used as a structural system. They would be composed together with rhodopsins; which would facilitate the optical computing process and help with the storage of biological materials. DNA (as the software for all living things) can be used as a structural proteomic system - a logical component for molecular computing. Ned Seeman - a researcher at New York University - along with other researchers are currently researching concepts that are similar to each other. =Bionanotechnology= DNA nanotechnology is one important example of bionanotechnology. The utilization of the inherent properties of nucleic acids like DNA to create useful materials is a promising area of modern research. Another important area of research involves taking advantage of membrane properties to generate synthetic membranes. Proteins that self-assemble to generate functional materials could be used as a novel approach for the large-scale production of programmable nanomaterials. One example is the development of amyloids found in bacterial biofilms as engineered nanomaterials that can be programmed genetically to have different properties. Protein folding studies provide a third important avenue of research, but one that has been largely inhibited by our inability to predict protein folding with a sufficiently high degree of accuracy. Given the myriad uses that biological systems have for proteins, though, research into understanding protein folding is of high importance and could prove fruitful for bionanotechnology in the future. Lipid nanotechnology is another major area of research in bionanotechnology, where physico-chemical properties of lipids such as their antifouling and self-assembly is exploited to build nanodevices with applications in medicine and engineering. Lipid nanotechnology approaches can also be used to develop next-generation emulsion methods to maximize both absorption of fat-soluble nutrients and the ability to incorporate them into popular beverages. =Agriculture= Nanotechnology application to biotechnology leaves no field untouched by its groundbreaking scientific innovations for human wellness; the agricultural industry is no exception. Basically, nanomaterials are distinguished depending on the origin: natural, incidental and engineered nanoparticles. Among these, engineered nanoparticles have received wide attention in all fields of science, including medical, materials and agriculture technology with significant socio- economical growth. In the agriculture industry, engineered nanoparticles have been serving as nano carriers, containing herbicides, chemicals, or genes, which target particular plant parts to release their content. Previously nanocapsules containing herbicides have been reported to effectively penetrate through cuticles and tissues, allowing the slow and constant release of the active substances. Likewise, other literature describes that nano-encapsulated slow release of fertilizers has also become a trend to save fertilizer consumption and to minimize environmental pollution through precision farming. These are only a few examples from numerous research works which might open up exciting opportunities for nanobiotechnology application in agriculture. Also, application of this kind of engineered nanoparticles to plants should be considered the level of amicability before it is employed in agriculture practices. Based on a thorough literature survey, it was understood that there is only limited authentic information available to explain the biological consequence of engineered nanoparticles on treated plants. Certain reports underline the phytotoxicity of various origin of engineered nanoparticles to the plant caused by the subject of concentrations and sizes . At the same time, however, an equal number of studies were reported with a positive outcome of nanoparticles, which facilitate growth promoting nature to treat plant. In particular, compared to other nanoparticles, silver and gold nanoparticles based applications elicited beneficial results on various plant species with less and/or no toxicity. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) treated leaves of Asparagus showed the increased content of ascorbate and chlorophyll. Similarly, AgNPs-treated common bean and corn has increased shoot and root length, leaf surface area, chlorophyll, carbohydrate and protein contents reported earlier. The gold nanoparticle has been used to induce growth and seed yield in Brassica juncea. Tools This field relies on a variety of research methods, including experimental tools (e.g. imaging, characterization via AFM/optical tweezers etc.), x-ray diffraction based tools, synthesis via self-assembly, characterization of self-assembly (using e.g. MP-SPR, DPI, recombinant DNA methods, etc.), theory (e.g. statistical mechanics, nanomechanics, etc.), as well as computational approaches (bottom-up multi- scale simulation, supercomputing).

It is on the former Ontario Highway 513 (present day Scotch Bush Road) just off Ontario Highway 132 north of the community of Dacre, and at the outlet of Constant Creek, a tributary of the Madawaska River, from Constant Lake, approximately 30 minutes drive time from the town of Renfrew. Balaclava is a near ghost town today, a come-down from the bustling lumber town of its heyday. It started as a small community named for battle in the Crimean war. Shortly after its founding a dam and sawmill were built and by the 1860s the small hamlet had acquired a blacksmith shop and hotel to go with its permanent residents. In 1903 a sawdust burner was built so that sawdust from the mill would not be dumped in the local river, thereby polluting it. The water-powered sawmill was rebuilt in 1939 after a fire destroyed the mill that had previously occupied the space and continued to operate until 1959. At that time the depletion of available timber had reduced production to uneconomically small amounts. With the loss of the mill the viability of Balaclava as a residential town was also lost. The sawmill was the last water-powered mill to operate in the Province of Ontario. Balaclava was listed in a book on ghost towns by Ron Brown. Although it makes Balaclava sound like a pristine, deserted ghost town, actually it still has a few residents. Early history The place Balaclava was named in 1859 to commemorate a key victory of the British Commonwealth during the Crimean War. The Battle of Balaklava was fought on 25 October 1854 as part of the Siege of Sevastopol. and was commanded by Colonel Thomas Griffith. In the mid-1800s, a dam was built out of timber towards the east outlet of Constant Lake along, a tributary of Madawaska River. Reports differ regarding the date of construction of the sawmill in Balaclava. The Ontario Law Reports, from 1911, indicate that the mill was erected in the year of 1855. However, an archeological assessment published in 2007, indicated the mill was constructed in 1861. Regardless, two men, named Duncan Ferguson and Donald Cameron, opened the sawmill in Balaclava, joining some of the nearly one-thousand saw mills in Upper Canada at that time. Before long, Cameron sold his portion of the mill to Ferguson. In addition to mill work, Ferguson sold goods in the area. The hamlet was rounded out with a blacksmith, two hotels and a general store, run by Joseph Lagree. As a result of the sawmill, and the timber industry in the Ottawa Valley in the 1800s, Balaclava became a rather busy settlement and bustling pioneer town. The Ottawa Valley was a natural place for a timber industry to develop. The pioneers found the land lush with coniferous trees, specifically spruce and hemlock, and red and white pine trees. European settlers were drawn to the area to cut the trees, create the square cut timber and pulp and the promises of lumber wealth. The growing town of Balaclava attracted other businessmen, such as William Hunter who built a grist mill two kilometers downstream of the dam. Hunter built his gristmill where the gradient of Constant Creek flattens into an area of poorly drained glacial outwash. =Lawsuit= In 1868, the sawmill and dam were sold to William Richards. The Richards family would be owners and operators for the following 89 years. In 1911, a pollution-based lawsuit was brought against the sawmill, in the court of judge Latchford, Pembroke and Ottawa. This lawsuit was one of the first pollution-based lawsuits in the Province of Ontario. William Hunter, plaintiff and owner of the local gristmill, complained that between 1904 and 1909, sawdust from the upstream sawmill was negatively affecting his gristmill operations, that Constant Creek was being fouled by the usage of the sawmill, that the flow of water in Constant Creek was impeded, that the defendant disposed of refuse in the creek and that, otherwise, the plaintiff suffered injury as a result. Hunter further complained that the pollution caused damage to his mill pond and that he could not properly run his gristmill, as a result. Richards, the defendant, claimed that he was within his rights based on three reasons: (1) by virtue of a grant from the Crown, (2) right of common law and (3) by easement rights under the Limitations Act. Citing other law cases, the judge dismantled the Richards' arguments. Part of the rationale was that the original owners of Richards' mill started the operation with one saw. In 1911, the year of the suit, the mill had many saws, shingle and lath mills, an edger and other various appliances. The addition of the number of saws and other pieces of equipment enabled an obvious increase in pollution, which the court argued, surpassed Richards' rights. Further damages had already been paid from 1896 to 1903, for damages and to cover the expense of disposing of the refuse, termed \\"driftwood\\" by witnesses consulted in the case. This provided an indication of guilt. Hunter won the suit, Richards was ordered to pay $200 in retribution and was required by order of an injunction to refrain from depositing refuse into the stream. Richards' was give four months to alter his mill to address the refuse situation. This action resulted in the installation the first sawdust burner in the Province of Ontario. In 1913, an appeal was made in the Ontario Supreme Court, Appellate Division, in an attempt to overturn the verdict. It was summarily dismissed. The appellate magistrate, J.A. Meredith, seemed to side on behalf of the plaintiff in his closing remarks, indicating that sawmill operations create a \\"nuisance\\" on the plaintiff's land and the land of many other people and local waterways; causing injury. \\" The nuisance\\", he remarked \\" becomes more and more objectionable and injurious as the surrounding country becomes more settled and the lands affected more highly cultivated and more valuable.\\" Regarding Richard's claim that the Crown grant from 1855 permitted his polluting of the stream, the court commented justice could not be retroactive. In other words, the needs of the early settlers were markedly different than the needs of society in 1913. Therefore the land grant of 1855 could not also apply as if the case were being tried in an earlier time, as Richards' had requested. The court indicated that privileges were actively being withdrawn and \\"'trespassing is forbidden'\\" is becoming the rule rather than the exception.\\" The appeal was dismissed \\"with costs\\". And in an ironic twist of fate, in 1915, it was reported in the Contract Record and Engineering Review that Harry Richards' mill had been destroyed by fire and that he had plans to rebuild the mill. =Concrete Dam= In 1927, the dam, known as the Balaclava Dam, was rebuilt, this time out of concrete. The dam served both the lumbering and sawmill industries. The concrete dam measured 2.5m high by 53m long. Present day Balaclava is now considered an abandoned or ghost town of Ontario. What remains is \\"a few houses, an abandoned general store and blacksmith shop, an old dam over which the main road passes and a marvelously intact 19th century sawmill\\". In 1983, the Balaclava Dam was purchased by the Ministry of Government Services due to concerns raised about low lake levels and poor dam operations. The dam supported a bridge on Scotch Bush Road which therefore involved the County of Renfrew. In 2012 and 2013, modifications were made to the dam and bridge structure to separate the two. Cost for the project was shared between the Ministry of Natural Resources and the County of Renfrew. This project was undertaken because the aging nature of the structure of the dam. The freeze and thaw cycles could no longer be contained within the 90-year-old concrete. Concerns about the dam's ability to control floods were cited by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), owner of the Balaclava Dam, and owner of over three-hundred other dams in the Province of Ontario. Further, the MNR cited it needed to be in compliance with requirements of subsection 35(2) of the Fisheries Act. This involved decommissioning Balaclava dam and the roadway above it, removing old structures, building a new and larger dam which was accomplished in 2013. The deed to the local area was purchased in the late 1980s by Michael Huneault, and is now in possession of Wendy Huneault. In 2016, Joey Huneault started small reconstructions of some of the buildings.Huneault personal records Next to the original location of the dam are two heritage structures that \\"represent early 20th century architecture and economy\\". One of which is the Richard's sawmill, located on the west bank of Constant Creek. The other is a red framed building that front the mill pond on the east side of the creek.

However, in the seventh edition of Bergey's, it was finally transferred to the genus Bacillus. DNA-based technology was used in distinguishing between the two genera of bacteria which are morphologically similar and possess similar physiological and biochemical characteristics.Bacillus coagulans (Lactobacillus sporogenes) a probiotic ? B. coagulans is a Gram-positive rod (0.9 by 3.0 to 5.0 Œºm in size), catalase positive, spore-forming, motile, and a facultative anaerobe. It may appear Gram-negative when entering the stationary phase of growth. The optimum temperature for growth is 50 ¬∞C (122 ¬∞F); range of temperatures tolerated are 30‚Äì55 ¬∞C (86‚Äì131 ¬∞F). IMViC tests VP and MR (methyl-red) tests are positive. Uses Bacillus coagulans has been added by the EFSA to their Qualified Presumption of Safety listThe maintenance of the list of QPS microorganisms intentionally added to food or feed - Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Biological Hazards and has been approved for veterinary purposes as GRAS by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, as well as by the European Union, and is listed by AAFCO for use as a direct-fed microbial in livestock production. It is often used in veterinary applications, especially as a probiotic in pigs, cattle, poultry, and shrimp. Many references to use of this bacterium in humans exist, especially in improving the vaginal flora,Hong et al., 2005; SCAN improving abdominal pain and bloating in irritable bowel syndrome patients, and increasing immune response to viral challenges. There is evidence from animal research that suggests that Bacillus coagulans is effective in both treating as well as preventing recurrence of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. One strain of this bacterium has also been assessed for safety as a food ingredient. Spores are activated in the acidic environment of the stomach and begin germinating and proliferating in the intestine. Sporeforming B. coagulans strains are used in some countries as probiotics for patients on antibiotics. Marketing B. coagulans is often marketed as Lactobacillus sporogenes or a 'sporeforming lactic acid bacterium' probiotic, but this is an outdated name due to taxonomic changes in 1939. Although B. coagulans does produce L+lactic acid, the bacterium used in these products is not a lactic-acid bacterium, as Bacillus species do not belong to the lactic acid bacteria. By definition, lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) do not form spores. Therefore, using the name Lactobacillus sporogenes is scientifically incorrect.

According to the , it has a population of people. Geography Bansalan is about south of Davao City and is very accessible by land transportation mostly by buses going to Cotabato City, Kidapawan and Tacurong. Bansalan is about north-west of the provincial capital city of Digos. The neighboring towns include Makilala in the north, Magsaysay in the west, Matanao in the south and Mount Apo and part of Digos in the east. =Barangays= Bansalan is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. =Climate= History Bansalan was a forest primeval and the aborigines were Bagobos. As they were nomadic, they traveled from one place to the other by hacking their way through the virgin forests. They also cultivated land for their staple food but soon left the place after harvest time in search of a better place to cultivate. They also had the wide area of hunting ground where at the end of the day, they brought home speared wild boar, deer or monkeys. The implements they had were crude but obviously the bow and arrow were used both in hunting and fishing. The waters then were crystal pure and were untarnished by the changing current ecology. In some certain sites, Bansalan had patches of cogonal land interspersed with tall trees demarcated by serene creeks and turbulent rivers gushing from the belly of Mount Apo, the highest mountain peak in the Philippines where according to legend, Apo Sandawa ruled as god. In early times, the Bagobo society was divided into datus or the chieftains, freemen, and slaves. The datus interpret customary laws. Marriages were arranged, the groom's parents selecting the bride and negotiating the match. A bride-price is paid according to their wealth, and the bride's parents also give a present equal to about half this amount to dispel the idea that they're selling their daughter. The groom has to serve the bride's family both before and after the wedding. The two-to three-day wedding ceremony takes place in the bride's home and ends with the bride and groom feeding each other a handful of rice. Young men strived to attain the rank of magani, a warrior class whose members had killed more than one enemy and were entitled to wear distinctive red clothing. A communal spirit prevailed, with everyone helping in house-building and cultivation. The inhabitants in this early settlement venerated the anitos and their religion is a pantheon of innumerable gimokods (spirits), knowledge of which resides in old men and women known as mabalian. The Bagobos celebrate Gin-Em festival which displays gratitude to the spirits for success in war or domestic matters, or for warding-off sickness, evil spirits, or danger. Two bamboo poles are erected in the house of a datu, then offerings are made, and a chicken is sacrificed. In former times, enemy skulls would be attached to the poles, and a slave sacrificed. Each magani relates his past exploits, and dancing, chanting of old songs and poems, feasting, and drinking fermented sugarcane wine continue till daybreak. The Bagobos produce baskets trimmed with beads and fibers, ornate weapons, and inlaid metal boxes finished with bells. A metal box where they kept betel nuts is inseparable. Bansalan was the name of the simple farmer who one day dug the earth in search of potable water to quench his thirst. Fortunately, he dug a well-spring, and did not only satisfy his thirst but also called his other companions to share his discovery. Rain widened the spring and the constant erosion of soil led its transformation into a creek, and later into a river. Unfortunately, Bansalan, the farmer did not live long. His companions who were the recipients of Bansalan's daring adventures named that the river after him and later also became the name of the fledgling village. President Elpidio Querino proclaimed Bansalan as a regular town on September 18, 1952, including two booming villages of Matanao and Kialeg in the south-west and western part of Bansalan which later became regular towns. Davao del Sur and parts of Northern Cotabato were established by good-natured relationships of the chieftains. In the beginning of the 20th century, Datu Tumunas of Bansalan launched feeder road constructions with the help of his own tribe people. Tumunas succeeded in linking Bansalan with Digos, ushering in the establishment of a harmonious relation between the Bagobos and the Kalagans, the natives of Digos. The friendship has expanded by leaps and bounds when they encouraged constant \\"tabo\\" or market following the old system of \\"ukom\\" or barter. Datus of neighboring places came to Bansalan to establish friendly relations with Datu Tumunas. Among them were Datu Julian and Datu Akwas. Later Datu Siman of Kidapawan succeeded in constructing a road linking the place with Bansalan. More friendly relations were established as the road construction increased.\\" Bansalan is situated at the north-western part of the Province of Davao del Sur. Towards the south is the Municipality of Matanao, to the west is the Municipality of Magsaysay, to the southeast is the Municipality of Digos and on the north-east lies the Mt. Apo National Park. Its total land area is 48,548 hectares and divided into 23 villages or barrios where the Poblacion is the main center. The Poblacion serves as the nerve-center of the town where all the schools, churches of different denominations, market, cinema, sports facilities, and other amenities are located. It is highly agricultural and most of the active young people work in Digos which now became the capital town of Davao del Sur. There are about 55,000 people living in the whole town including the villages. In the early 1950s, a big number of migrants from other parts of the country but mainly from Cebu settled in Bansalan which drastically changed the lives of the Bagobos, the native inhabitants of the place. The Bagobos retreated to the hinterlands, and the settlers took over the running and further development of the town. At present, not one public official is a native Bagobo, the tribe which was responsible in the establishment of the town. What remained is the name of Datu Bansalan but his daring adventures are already long forgotten by the town people. Town anniversaries are celebrated with grand fiestas and parades but Datu Bansalan is no longer remembered in the history nor given an appropriate celebration in honor of his founding the town. People remember the date Pres. Quirino officially proclaimed Bansalan as a regular town as if the history of the town only started in September 1952.

Mainly an agricultural community, upland barangays are planted with corn, sugarcane, soybeans, cotton and coconuts. The central barangays are considered as the rice granary of the municipality and that of the province, being within the service coverage area of the Padada River Irrigation System. The eastern barangays are mostly cultivated into plantation crops such as coconuts, cacao, bananas, and lately mangoes as well as fishponds. In terms of land area, the biggest barangay is Hagonoy Crossing with 1,589 hectares while the smallest is Clib with only 151 hectares. =Climate= History Before its creation into a municipality, Hagonoy was a sitio of barrio Digos, municipality of Santa Cruz. Then, when the municipality of Padada was created on July 1, 1949, Hagonoy was annexed as one of its barrios. On May 28, 1953, by virtue of Executive Order No. 596 issued by President Elpidio V. Quirino, Hagonoy was separated from Padada and became a regular municipality.Then in early 1970's, batch of Cebuanos came from Danao City, particularly from Caputatan, among them Nathaniel Capuyan and Loselo Capuno Sr., who worked in the sugarcane plantations and settled in barangay Maliit Digos. And from then on plenty of others who came from Caputatan, Danao City followed, and eventually found a place in a land owned by Alejandro Almendras. Republic Act No. 2094, which defined the boundaries of Hagonoy, referred to its territory as comprising the barrios of Kibuaya, Upper Sacub, Lower Sacub, Maliit-Digos, La Union, Malabang, Tulogan, Malinao, Guihing, Pawa, Hagonoy, Balutakay, Leling, and Sinayawan, and the sitios of Quezon and Polopolo. The first set of appointed municipal officials assumed office on July 5 of the same year. Since its creation into a municipality to date, two (2) appointed and seven (7) elected mayors guided the development and destiny of the town. The appointed mayors were Antonio Go Pace (Quirino Administration) and Ramon Sacedon (Magsaysay Administration). The first elected Mayor was Gonzalo S. Palamos Sr.. He served for one term (4 years). Then was elected Board Member of Davao Province (undivided) for two consecutive terms (8 years). Alfredo Salutillo then became mayor of Hagonoy for two consecutive terms Gonzalo S. Palamos Sr. was again elected mayor for his second term. Bartolome G. Hernandez Jr. (1 term and extended by the proclamation of martial law). Mayor Filomeno V. Surposa, was appointed as Officer-In-Charge under the Freedom Constitution after the famous EDSA Revolution and was elected into office during the election on January 17, 1988. Mayor Manuel M.

Barrios Batulaki (5,181) and Caburan (6,197) seceded and established as a separate town on August 1, 1948 and was originally named \\"Trinidad\\".https://archive.org/download/PhilippinesCensusofPopulationLGUs19032007/Region%2011%20Davao%20Region%20Philippines%20Census%20of%20Population%201903%20-%202007.xlsx The barrio of Caburan became its poblacion or town center. In 1954, the municipality was renamed by Republic Act no. 1206, in honor of Jos√© Abad Santos, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, who was executed by the Japanese invading forces during World War II. Geography It is the southernmost municipality on the mainland of Mindanao island. The coastal town is the second largest municipality in Davao Occidental after Malita. =Barangays= Jose Abad Santos is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. =Climate= Demographics Economy Vast natural resources can be found, such as the wide stretch of mangroves of the municipality. Milkfish and tilapia breeding, as well as copra production, are the primary source of income for its people. The long stretch of beaches with brown, black and white sands, together with abundant marine life offshore are the primary natural attractions of Jose Abad Santos.

Past the town of Sulop is the junction with Davao del Sur Provincial Highway. Turning east at the junction, head south on the provincial highway to the town of Malita. And to the said municipality, habal-habal or passenger motorcycles ply to the adjacent town Don Marcelino. =Road condition= The road condition of the town is poor. Its road network is mostly unpaved, traversing through high-sloped hilly coastal and mountain roads with the danger of falling rocks from above. Most of the river crossings have no bridges, so drivers traversing the town have to consider if their vehicle is capable of crossing a shallow river. During rainy weather, travelers have to wait for the water level to subside before the river could become accessible again. A trip to the town is considered as either adventurous or dangerous by those who intend to visit depending on their experience, though part of the road heading to Don Marcelino town to the north is paved, made with concrete cement. =Controversy= On August 20, 2013, former provincial representative Marc Douglas Cagas IV complained about the DPWH's complacency about the project involving the improving of roads going to the municipality. He attributed the complacency to the pork barrel scandal that was already happening in the country's politics since several days before the said complaint due to overspending of their budget for the said project.http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/07/17/pork-mess-mere-cover-up-of- palace-corruption/ See also *List of renamed cities and municipalities in the Philippines References External links * Jose Abad Santos Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] * Philippine Census Information * Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Davao Occidental ","title":"Jose Abad Santos, Davao Occidental"},{"id":"2154619","text":"', officially the ' (; ), is a in the province of , .

Gaginaway Festival is celebrated annually every full moon on the month of November and Araw ng Malita is also celebrated annually on November 17. Etymology According to folk etymology, the name \\"Malita\\" is derived from the Spanish word \\"maleta\\" which means suitcase. It is said that purportedly Don Mariano Peralta, a retired veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War who ventured to the place, decided to live on the vast, fertile plain across the river. One day while bodily fording the deep and swift river with his suitcase and other belongings in hand, the force of the current overwhelmed his perilous balance and got swept by the water consequently losing his grip on the suitcase. His frantic shouts of \\"maleta, maleta\\" attracted the attention of the bathing natives who after realizing the situation promptly responded and retrieved the vanishing to settle as Malita. How it came to its present spelling and usage maybe attributed to the natives‚Äô prevalent use of suitcase. Hardly forgetting the shouts of Peralta, the natives later thought the word referred to the land he intended long 'e' sound for the vowels 'i' and 'e'. History Malita is the oldest community in the province. Malita's existence dates back scores of years before its formal creation as municipality on November 17, 1936. Records show that Malita must have existed long before the passage of the Philippine Commission Act, the Laws of the Moro Province that mentioned Malita in Section 1 of Act No. 164 dated December 10, 1904. Through the said Act it is presumed that it existed as a barrio of Santa Cruz long before the coming of the Americans to Davao. Executive Order No. 64 issued by President Manuel L. Quezon officially created Malita into a municipality. Marcelino Maruya, from whom the town of Don Marcelino was named after, was the first appointed municipal mayor. Waves of migrants from the Visayan islands, most of whom hail from Cebu, came on what is now Malita long before it became a municipality. They were later followed by immigrants from Luzon. Even after the destruction brought by World War II by the belligerents, there are still waves of migrants towards Malita and other parts of then-Davao province. This increased its population until it later became the most populous municipality in the province. Demographics Climate Economy The municipality is the main economic center of Davao Occidental province. Agriculture and fishery is the main industry of the municipality. Being far from other major urban centers in its vicinity like Davao City, Digos City, and Gen. Santos City, and although only a town, Malita also serves as the major urban center of the province. However, as economic activity in the town continues its rapid growth, Malita will soon become the province's first component city for years to come.

According to the , it has a population of people. The Municipality of Santa Cruz is part of Metropolitan Davao.  Geography  Santa Cruz situates in the Northern part of Davao del Sur. Bounded by Davao City on the north and south by the city of Digos. After undergoing several political subdivisions, 27,960 hectares of land was left representing 6.7% of the total land area of Davao del Sur. Forest land comprises 60% and the rest includes the 8 coastal barangays in the area. The land area of Santa Cruz per Board of Technical Survey and Maps is 27,960 hectares. However, based on the Field Appraisal and Assessment Sheets (FAAS) and Tax Maps of the Municipal Assessor's Office the total land area of the municipality is 28,759.7855 or about 7.31% of the province's area (393,401 hectares). This excludes the Kapatagan contested area. Among the 18 barangays, Sibulan has the biggest land area of 6,390.6581 hectares or 22.22% of the total land area. Poblacion Zone III has the smallest area of 105.3148, only 0.37% of the total. =Topography= Santa Cruz is traversed by mountain ranges and high relief that include part of the famed Mount Apo, the highest mountain peak in the Philippines, straddle the south, central, north and north-western portions of the municipality. The rugged topography of the central area gradually undulates toward the coastal plains of the north- eastern, eastern and south-eastern parts. Here, settlements sprawl contiguously along the coast of Davao Gulf under the vast monotony of coconut plantations. On the western frontier, a plateau stretches toward Barangay Kapatagan of Digos City. The municipal elevation ranges from above sea level (m.a.s.1.). =Barangays= Santa Cruz is politically subdivided into 18 barangays. Of the 18 barangays, 7 are uplands, 9 are upland-lowland and coastal and 2 are lowland-coastal. =Climate= Santa Cruz has a favorable climate all year round characterized by wet and dry seasons. It is outside the typhoon belt. Generally the months of November to April are dry periods. Wet season occurs from May to October. This type of climate is observable in the plain and coastal areas. In the mountainous barangays, the fourth type of climate is consistently experienced. Rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Most often in these areas heavy downpour occurs every afternoon while in the morning the sun shines.  History  Santa Cruz is the oldest municipality in the province; it was founded on 5 October 1884, thirty-six years after the foundation of Davao, which is its mother city, by Don Jose Uyanguren of Guip√∫zcoa, Spain. It all started when Spanish pioneers and missionaries attempted to settle and Christianize the area in what is now Barangay Poblacion as early as 1880. But because of the relentless Islamic faith of the local people in the area, the enraged pioneers and missionaries planted a cross under a shelter to mark the failure of the missionaries to convert these people to Christianity; the town's name now bears the name of the cross planted by those Spaniards. Fortunately, for the next 4 years, the local people will submit themselves to Christianity and had themselves conquered by Angel Rodriguez, the Spanish Governor-General of Davao. But, like Don Uyanguren's attempt to develop the newly established Davao, the area around the young town did not prosper until after almost 20 years since then. The Americans arrived in Davao in the early 1900s after the Spanish defeat in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Fourteen years later, the town began to grow economically, although overshadowed by the booming economic growth of its neighbour Davao. Several Japanese entrepreneurs like Kyusaburo Otta and Yoshizo Furukawa are living in the region to exploit more agricultural territories, the former in Davao and the latter in what is now the barangays Darong and Inauayan. On 16 March 1936, its mother town, Davao, became one of the first two cities in Mindanao, the other being Zamboanga, due to the town's faster economic growth and agricultural boom. On 1942, it was the beginning of Japanese invasion of the Philippines. The town suffered greatly during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, unlike its neighbor Davao, which fared well and continued its economic growth during that time. The local recognized guerrillas and the military troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units continued to attack the Imperial Japanese forces. On 1945, combined Filipino and American troops including recognized guerrillas fought the Japanese and liberated the town. The general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary was active from 1945 to 1946 and was located in the town. After the war, most of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz moved to Davao in search of economic opportunities; despite this, the town continued its population and economic growth, though at a slower rate. Almost three years after the Philippine Independence on 4 July 1946, two towns broke off from the municipality, namely: Padada, on 15 July 1949; and Digos on 19 July in the same year. In 1960's, a new municipality, Roxas, was carved out from the town, covering the present-day barangays of Inauayan, Darong, Astorga, Coronon, and Sibulan; however, the Supreme Court of the Philippines nullified the creation of the municipality since this meant the collapse of the jurisdiction of once the most Christianized town in Mindanao. One of the municipalities which broke off from the town, Digos, became the capital town of the newly created Davao del Sur province in 1967; thirty-three years later it would become a city and will be the most populous in the entire province, excluding Davao City. =Aspiration for cityhood= On 5 October 2013, during the town's 129th anniversary of its existence, its local government leaders and populace have envisioned for a new aspiration for the town to become a city, given the presence of large industrial companies like the San Miguel Corporation, Coco Davao Inc., Franklin Baker Co., GSL Food Industries in the town. The municipal mayor Joel Ray Lopez commented, \\"As the oldest town in the province of Davao del Sur, we really wanted it to become a city soon.\\" Its infrastructure have been moderately improved, and most of its cityhood requirements, specifically its income and total land area requirements, have been already met. When the municipality of Santa Cruz finally becomes a city, full industrialization in the area may be expected. Demographics =Languages= The languages spoken here in the municipality are Davaoe√±o, Tagalog, Mansakan, and English.  Economy  Agriculture: Among agricultural crops, coconut leads in production followed by banana and sugarcane. Other major crops are corn, coffee and vegetables. The municipality also produces high value fruits like mango, lanzones and durian. Cattle leads in livestock production. Fisheries: The 24-kilometer long coastline of Santa Cruz which forms part of the Davao Gulf provides a rich fishing grounds and is suitable for aquaculture. Mining: Deposits of sulfur ore, rock phosphate, guano, limestone and cement raw materials were also traced but still have to be tapped for commercial and industrial uses. Forestry: Tropical evergreen and other timber cover the vast timberland and forest area. Rattan, bamboo and other vines are also in abundance. Major industries: Banana, Coconut, and Seaweed cultivation.

The municipality is located halfway between two major growth centers of Mindanao, namely, Davao City of Region XI and General Santos City of Region XII. =Barangays= Sulop is politically subdivided into 25 barangays. =Climate= History In the early part of the 19th century, a wave of immigrants from the Visayas Region, mostly from Cebu, came to Sulop which was still a barangays under the Municipality of Padada, Davao del Sur. Settlers from Leyte, Iloilo and Bohol also arrived during the century. They acquired lands from the natives known as Tagacaolo, B‚Äôlaans and Bagobos who were the early inhabitants of the place. The name Sulop was derived from its natives which means swampy place surrounded by second growth forest and habitat of wild pigs. Settlers, then converted the place into settlement sites and production areas of agricultural crops. By virtue of Executive Order No. 295 issued on April 24, 1958, President Carlos P. Garcia converted barangays Sulop and its adjacent barangays into an independent Municipality of Sulop of the Province of Davao del Sur. The development of the municipality underwent eight changes of political leadership up to the present Administration. President Carlos P Garcia appointed Nestorio Comabig as the first mayor of the Municipality of Sulop. Mayor Nestorio Comabig‚Äôs achievement was the assignment of residential lots to interested parties consistent to the town site development plan. However, Mayor Nestorio Comabig resigned from office after six years he assumed the office. The then Vice Mayor Antonio Go Pace assumed the vacated mayorship position and facilitated the construction of the first municipality‚Äôs Town Hall. right Vice Mayor Sebastian Mondejar, Sr. succeeded the mayorship of Antonio Go Pace when the latter died and the former facilitated the coming of Cocoa Investors, Incorporated (CII), a multi-million peso corporation engaged in cacao beans production; Vice Mayor Perfecto O. Sagarino Sr. succeeded as mayor when Mayor Sebastian Mondejar Sr. was killed in an ambush on December 3, 1982, during the height of insurgency. Mayor Perfecto Sagarino Sr.'s greatest achievement was the construction of Sulop Public Market Buildings. He relinquished his position after the EDSA Revolution (People Power Revolution) in 1986; Atty. Leopoldo C. Diones, Jr. was then installed as OIC-Mayor who retained his position by winning the 1987 and 1992 elections. Atty. Jose Jimmy S. Sagarino, son of former mayor Perfecto O. Sagarino emerged the winner in the mayoralty race in 1995 and stayed on for 3 terms. The construction of the new Municipal Government Center of Sulop was made during his incumbency. On June 30, 2004, local leadership was then steered by Mayor Restituto Ornales. In his quest to sustain the obtaining momentum of development, he placed agricultural productivity as the center piece of his development thrust and initiated the construction of Labon ‚Äì Clib Steel Bridge. The latest change in leadership took place on June 30, 2007, when the newly elect-mayor assumed post at 12:00 noon which marked the returned of undefeated 3-termer Mayor Jose Jimmy S.

Ivory book cover. Late Antiquity Imperial scenes adapted to a Christian theme. Carolingian art comes from the Frankish Empire in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900‚Äîduring the reign of Charlemagne and his immediate heirs‚Äîpopularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important monasteries under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the Low Countries, and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the Insular art of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres. The Lothair Crystal, engraved rock crystal, mid-9th century There was for the first time a thoroughgoing attempt in Northern Europe to revive and emulate classical Mediterranean art forms and styles, that resulted in a blending of classical and Northern elements in a sumptuous and dignified style, in particular introducing to the North confidence in representing the human figure, and setting the stage for the rise of Romanesque art and eventually Gothic art in the West. The Carolingian era is part of the period in medieval art sometimes called the \\"Pre-Romanesque\\". After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new Ottonian dynasty revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in Ottonian art. Overview Ivory plaque, probably from a book cover, Reims late 9th century, with two scenes from the life of Saint Remy and the Baptism of Clovis Having established an Empire as large as the Byzantine Empire of the day, and rivaling in size the old Western Roman Empire, the Carolingian court must have been conscious that they lacked an artistic style to match these or even the post-antique (or \\"sub-antique\\" as Ernst Kitzinger called it)Kitzinger, 8 art still being produced in small quantities in Rome and a few other centres in Italy, which Charlemagne knew from his campaigns, and where he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome in 800. As symbolic representative of Rome he sought the renovatio (revival) of Roman culture and learning in the West, and needed an art capable of telling stories and representing figures with an effectiveness which ornamental Germanic Migration period art could not.Kitzinger, 40‚Äì42 He wished to establish himself as the heir to the great rulers of the past, to emulate and symbolically link the artistic achievements of Early Christian and Byzantine culture with his own. But it was more than a conscious desire to revive ancient Roman culture. During Charlemagne's reign the Byzantine Iconoclasm controversy was dividing the Byzantine Empire. Charlemagne supported the Western church's consistent refusal to follow iconoclasm; the Libri Carolini sets out the position of his court circle, no doubt under his direction. With no inhibitions from a cultural memory of Mediterranean pagan idolatry, Charlemagne introduced the first Christian monumental religious sculpture, a momentous precedent for Western art. Reasonable numbers of Carolingian illuminated manuscripts and small-scale sculptures, mostly in ivory, have survived, but far fewer examples of metalwork, mosaics and frescoes and other types of work. Many manuscripts in particular are copies or reinterpretations of Late Antique or Byzantine models, nearly all now lost, and the nature of the influence of specific models on individual Carolingian works remains a perennial topic in art history. As well as these influences, the extravagant energy of Insular art added a definite flavour to Carolingian work, which sometimes used interlaced decoration, and followed more cautiously the insular freedom in allowing decoration to spread around and into the text on the page of a manuscript. With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, high quality artistic production greatly declined for about three generations in the Empire. By the later 10th century with the Cluny reform movement, and a revived spirit for the idea of Empire, art production began again. New Pre- Romanesque styles appeared in Germany with the Ottonian art of the next stable dynasty, in England with late Anglo-Saxon art, after the threat from the Vikings was removed, and in Spain. Illuminated manuscripts Drogo Sacramentary, c. 850: a historiated initial 'C' contains the Ascension of Christ. The text is in gold ink. The most numerous surviving works of the Carolingian renaissance are illuminated manuscripts. A number of luxury manuscripts, mostly Gospel books, have survived, decorated with a relatively small number of full-page miniatures, often including evangelist portraits, and lavish canon tables, following the precedent of the Insular art of Britain and Ireland. Narrative images and especially cycles are rarer, but many exist, mostly of the Old Testament, especially Genesis; New Testament scenes are more often found on the ivory reliefs on the covers.Kitzinger, 69. Dodwell, 49 discusses the reasons for this. The oversized and heavily decorated initials of Insular art were adopted, and the historiated initial further developed, with small narrative scenes seen for the first time towards the end of the period‚Äînotably in the Drogo Sacramentary. Luxury manuscripts were given treasure bindings or rich covers with jewels set in gold and carved ivory panels, and, as in Insular art, were prestige objects kept in the church or treasury, and a different class of object from the working manuscripts kept in the library, where some initials might be decorated, and pen drawings added in a few places. A few of the grandest imperial manuscripts were written on purple parchment. The Bern Physiologus is a relatively rare example of a secular manuscript heavily illustrated with fully painted miniatures, lying in between these two classes, and perhaps produced for the private library of an important individual, as was the Vatican Terence. The Utrecht Psalter, stands alone as a very heavily illustrated library version of the Psalms done in pen and wash, and almost certainly copied from a much earlier manuscript. Other liturgical works were sometimes produced in luxury manuscripts, such as sacramentaries, but no Carolingian Bible is decorated as heavily as the Late Antique examples that survive in fragments. Teaching books such as theological, historical, literary and scientific works from ancient authors were copied and generally only illustrated in ink, if at all. The Chronography of 354 was a Late Roman manuscript that apparently was copied in the Carolingian period, though this copy seems to have been lost in the 17th century. =Centres of illumination= Carolingian manuscripts are presumed to have been produced largely or entirely by clerics, in a few workshops around the Carolingian Empire, each with its own style that developed based on the artists and influences of that particular location and time.Dodwell, 52 Manuscripts often have inscriptions, not necessarily contemporary, as to who commissioned them, and which church or monastery they were given to, but few dates or names and locations of those producing them. The surviving manuscripts have been assigned, and often reassigned, to workshops by scholars, and the controversies attending this process have largely died down. The earliest workshop was the Court School of Charlemagne; then a Rheimsian style, which became the most influential of the Carolingian period; a Touronian style; a Drogo style; and finally a Court School of Charles the Bald. These are the major centres, but others exist, characterized by the works of art produced there. Saint Mark from the Ebbo Gospels The Court School of Charlemagne (also known as the Ada School) produced the earliest manuscripts, including the Godescalc Evangelistary (781‚Äì783); the Lorsch Gospels (778‚Äì820); the Ada Gospels; the Soissons Gospels; the Harley Golden Gospels (800-820); and the Vienna Coronation Gospels; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised. The Court School manuscripts were ornate and ostentatious, and reminiscent of 6th-century ivories and mosaics from Ravenna, Italy. They were the earliest Carolingian manuscripts and initiated a revival of Roman classicism, yet still maintained Migration Period art (Merovingian and Insular) traditions in their basically linear presentation, with no concern for volume and spatial relationships. In the early 9th-century Archbishop Ebo of Rheims, at Hautvillers (near Rheims), assembled artists and transformed Carolingian art to something entirely new. The Gospel book of Ebbo (816‚Äì835) was painted with swift, fresh and vibrant brush strokes, evoking an inspiration and energy unknown in classical Mediterranean forms. Other books associated with the Rheims school include the Utrecht Psalter, which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the Bern Physiologus, the earliest Latin edition of the Christian allegorical text on animals. The expressive animations of the Rheims school, in particular the Utrecht Psalter with its naturalistic expressive figurine line drawings, would have influence on northern medieval art for centuries to follow, into the Romanesque period. Another style developed at the monastery of St Martin of Tours, in which large Bibles were illustrated based on Late Antique bible illustrations. Three large Touronian Bibles were created, the last, and best, example was made about 845/846 for Charles the Bald, called the Vivian Bible. The Tours School was cut short by the invasion of the Normans in 853, but its style had already left a permanent mark on other centers in the Carolingian Empire. From the Utrecht Psalter, 9th-century Naturalistic and energetic figurine line drawings were entirely new, and were to become the most influential innovation of Carolinian art in later periods. The diocese of Metz was another center of Carolingian art. Between 850 and 855 a sacramentary was made for Bishop Drogo called the Drogo Sacramentary. The illuminated \\"historiated\\" decorated initials (see image this page) were to have influence into the Romanesque period and were a harmonious union of classical lettering with figural scenes. In the second half of the 9th century the traditions of the first half continued. A number of richly decorated Bibles were made for Charles the Bald, fusing Late Antiquity forms with the styles developed at Rheims and Tours. It was during this time a Franco-Saxon style appeared in the north of France, integrating Hiberno-Saxon interlace, and would outlast all other Carolingian styles into the next century. Charles the Bald, like his grandfather, also established a Court School. Its location is uncertain but several manuscripts are attributed to it, with the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram (870) being the last and most spectacular. It contained Touronian and Rheimsian elements, but fused with the style that characterized Charlemagne's Court School more formal manuscripts. With the death of Charles the Bald patronage for manuscripts declined, signaling the beginning of the end, but some work did continue for a while. The Abbey of St. Gall created the Folchard Psalter (872) and the Golden Psalter (883). This Gallish style was unique, but lacked the level of technical mastery seen in other regions. Sculpture and metalwork Gem-encrusted cover of the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, 870 Luxury Carolingian manuscripts were intended to have treasure bindings‚Äîornate covers in precious metal set with jewels around central carved ivory panels‚Äîsometimes these were donated some time after the manuscript itself was produced. Only a few such covers have survived intact, but many of the ivory panels survive detached, where the covers have been broken up for their materials. The subjects were often narrative religious scenes in vertical sections, largely derived from Late Antique paintings and carvings, as were those with more hieratic images derived from consular diptychs and other imperial art, such as the front and back covers of the Lorsch Gospels, which adapt a 6th-century Imperial triumph to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin. Important Carolingian examples of goldsmith's work include the upper cover of the Lindau Gospels; the cover of the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which can be precisely dated to 870, is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald), and often called his \\"Palace School\\". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but Saint-Denis Abbey outside Paris is one leading possibility.Lasko, 60‚Äì68 The Arnulf Ciborium (a miniature architectural ciborium rather than the vessel for hosts), now in the Munich Residenz, is the third major work in the group; all three have fine relief figures in repouss√© gold. Another work associated with the workshop is the frame of an antique serpentine dish in the Louvre.Lasko, 64‚Äì65, 66‚Äì67; picture of the dish Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either. Charlemagne revived large-scale bronze casting when he created a foundry at Aachen which cast the doors for his palace chapel, in imitation of Roman designs. The chapel also had a now lost life-size crucifix, with the figure of Christ in gold, the first known work of this type, which was to become so important a feature of medieval church art. Probably a wooden figure was mechanically gilded, as with the Ottonian Golden Madonna of Essen. One of the finest examples of Carolingian goldsmiths' work is the Golden Altar (824‚Äì859), a paliotto, in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. The altars four sides are decorated with images in gold and silver repouss√©, framed by borders of filigree, precious stones and enamel. The Lothair Crystal, of the middle of the 9th century, is one of the largest of a group of about 20 engraved pieces of rock crystal which survive; this shows large numbers of figures in several scenes showing the unusual subject of the story of Suzanna. Mosaics and frescos Mosaic of the Ark of the Covenant, Germigny-des-Pr√©s, c. 806, but restored. The subject seems drawn from illuminated Jewish bibles, and relates to the Libri Carolini, possibly written by Theodulf, where the Ark is cited as divine approval of sacred images. Sources attest to the abundance of wall paintings seen in churches and palaces, most of which have not survived. Records of inscriptions show that their subject matter was primarily religious.Dodwell, p. 45 Mosaics installed in Charlemagne's palatine chapel showed an enthroned Christ worshipped by the Evangelist's symbols and the twenty-four elders from the Apocalypse. This mosaic no longer survives, but an over-restored one remains in the apse of the oratory at Germigny-des-Pr√©s (806) which shows the Ark of the Covenant adored by angels, discovered in 1820 under a coat of plaster. The villa to which the oratory was attached belonged to a key associate of Charlemagne, Bishop Theodulf of Orl√©ans. It was destroyed later in the century, but had frescos of the Seven liberal arts, the Four Seasons, and the Mappa Mundi.Beckwith, 13‚Äì17 We know from written sources of other frescos in churches and palaces, nearly all completely lost. Charlemagne's Aachen palace contained a wall painting of the Liberal Arts, as well as narrative scenes from his war in Spain. The palace of Louis the Pious at Ingelheim contained historical images from antiquity to the time of Charlemagne, and the palace church contained typological scenes of the Old and New Testaments juxtaposed with one another. Fragmentary paintings have survived at Auxerre, Coblenz, Lorsch, Cologne, Fulda, Corvey, Trier, M√ºstair, Mals, Naturns, Cividale, Brescia and Milan. Spolia Lorsch Gospels 778‚Äì820. Charlemagne's Court School. Spolia is the Latin term for \\"spoils\\" and is used to refer to the taking or appropriation of ancient monumental or other art works for new uses or locations. We know that many marbles and columns were brought from Rome northward during this period. Perhaps the most famous example of Carolingian spolia is the tale of an equestrian statue. In Rome, Charlemagne had seen the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Lateran Palace. It was the only surviving statue of a pre-Christian Roman Emperor because it was mistakenly thought, at the time, to be that of Constantine and thus held great accord‚ÄîCharlemagne thus brought an equestrian statue from Ravenna, then believed to be that of Theodoric the Great, to Aachen, to match the statue of \\"Constantine\\" in Rome. Antique carved gems were reused in various settings, without much regard to their original iconography. See also * Carolingian architecture * Codex Vaticanus 3868 Notes References * Beckwith, John.

Etymology Baganga got its name from a thorny bush having plum like fruits that were abundant during the Spanish arrival. Others say that it was referred to a big mouth of a river that traversed the central part of the town. History The Mandaya tribes having a colourful presentation in giving receptions to the hungry Spaniards has encouraged the survivors to report to Spain how beautiful the town was. Thus, on the Villalobos expedition on August 7, 1543 it encouraged the chronicler Garcia Descalante Alvarado to take note and make the necessary observation to King Philip.

Southern Kamayo is also spoken in Southern Lingig, Surigao del Sur, in Cateel, Caraga and some parts of Davao Oriental. It is also related to Surigaonon and Butuanon. Dialect variations are caused by mixed dialect communications between the Mandaya, Cebuano and other immigrants now living in the area. A prefix is added in most adjectives.

History  Banaybanay was primarily inhabited by the Mandayas in the uplands of Causwagan, Panikian and Mahayag, and Kalagans in shorelines and the mouth rivers of Piso, Pongoton, Mogbongcogon and Maputi which they have a strong settlement and a Muslim governance on that area leads by a Datus or Imams. Around the 1800s before Uyanguren arrived in the Davao, there was a strong community of the Kalagans (Kagan) in the Piso which was led by a chieftain named Datu Panayangan. Their dwelling was along the Piso River along with his people who lived there peacefully. The story of the arriving of the Kallaw people from Samal Island is very well known especially among the Kalagans of Banaybanay. They arrived in the Piso to settle there along with their Kalagan brothers on the permission of Datu Panayangan. The Kallaw chieftain named Datu Lamaran reconciled to Datu Panayangan to settle the swampy place of Piso which later was called Barrio Pongoton from the word pangotanan which means \\"a place of abundance of fish and crabs to catch\\". Until now, the grandsons or the clans of Datu Panayangan and Datu Lamaran are still living on the areas that divide into many families. = Second World War = At the time of Japanese occupation, Banaybanay (formerly known as Piso) was an important location for the Japanese in the Second World War due to its strategic location in the Davao Gulf. The Japanese established a camp called Piso Camp in Barangay Calubihan.

Lupon is said to have derived its name from the native word \\"naluponan\\", meaning a body of land accumulated at the mouth of a river resulting from years of continued accretion. The settlers shortened the word \\"naluponan\\" into what is called now \\"Lupon\\". This \\"naluponan\\" area was then applied to the mouth of the Sumlug river of Lupon municipality of today. Barangays Lupon is politically subdivided into 21 barangays. Demographics Lupon, like many areas of Mindanao, is inhabited by the Mandaya, Mansaka, the native Kalagans, and the local immigrants from all points of the Visayas, Luzon and Mindanao. The immigrants brought with them their culture resulting in a mixture of beliefs and practices. Climate History Lupon was primarily inhabited by the Mandaya and Mansaka in the hinterlands, and the native Kalagans in the shorelines of Lupon connected to Pantukan municipality and San Isidro municipality today. But, through a wave of migration [local immigrants from Luzon and the Visayas (Christians and Muslims alike)] and the coming of logging concessions, the population of Lupon has increased through the succeeding years. The migrants from Luzon and Visayas took advantage of the natives' kindness and ignorance. They took their lands and were even proud to tell stories that the natives (Mandayas) changed their lands for sardines and tobacco. The land grabbers and their descendants insult Mandayas on a daily basis. They treat them like they are lower life forms. They yell at them \\"Mandaya! Mandaya!\\" like being a Mandaya is a shameful thing. When a person behaves stupidly they will say \\"You are like a Mandaya.\\" All of them does it including the educated ones. =Creation into a Municipal District= Lupon first became a regular barrio of Pantukan in 1919. Two years later Governor General Francis Burton Harrison issued an Executive Order No. 8, series of 1921, creating Lupon as a Municipal District comprising eight (8) barrios that include Poblacion Lupon, Sumlog, Cocornon, Tagugpo, Piso, Maputi, Langka, and Banaybanay. For the meantime, Datu Commara Manuel was appointed as the municipal district president from 1921 to 1929. The American Occupation in the Philippine Islands was serious about pacifying inhabitants from rebellion against the American regime. What they did was to create Mindanao into a Moro Province, at the expense of the Christians both Catholic and Protestants also inhabiting the whole region. It was on this ground that Lupon was said to have been made into a sultanate with Datu Manuel as its sultan. But such an idea of Lupon becoming a sultanate was short-lived as Datu Manuel was replaced by the succeeding municipal district presidents. These were the municipal district presidents after Datu Manuel: Alfredo Lindo (1929‚Äì1931); Luis Yabut (1931‚Äì1933); Teodoro Panuncialman (1933‚Äì1939); Carlos Badolato (1939 to the outbreak of World War II); Sixto Carreon (1940 onward to the Japanese Occupation); Cresencio Tuballa (1944‚Äì1945 time of the Philippine Commonwealth military and Recognized Guerrillas); Claudio Libre (1945‚Äì1946); Cresencio Tuballa (1946); and Carlos Badolato (1946‚Äì1947). =Creation into a regular municipality= Lupon was created into a regular municipality on August 8, 1948, by virtue of Executive Order No. 151, s. 1948 with Teodoro Panuncialman as the first appointed mayor of Lupon. But that appointment was cut short by another appointment of Crisanto Magno as mayor of Lupon from 1948 to 1950; however Panuncialman was re-appointed for 1950‚Äì1951. At this time in 1951, a local election installed Crisanto Magno as the first elected mayor of Lupon from 1951 to 1955. Then the succeeding elected mayors were privileged to take responsibility of the unbroken mayoralty seat of Lupon. Oswaldo Barol (1955‚Äì67); Eulalio Angala Jr. (1967‚Äì79); Francisco M. dela Cruz (1979‚Äì86); then at the transition from the Marcos to the Aquino administration brought about by the February 1986 Edsa Revolution, Jose Lim was appointed Office In- Charge (1986‚Äì87); then Francisco dela Cruz was again re-elected (1988‚Äì98); Qui√±ones was elected in May (1998‚Äì2001); and Gui√±ez was elected in May 2001. But his untimely death brought the Vice Mayor Barabag to the mayoralty seat in 2002 to finish the term up until 2004. Qui√±ones was again elected to office during the 2004 elections and would serve the office until 2007. In 2007 Domingo Lim was first elected and served as mayor until 2016 after winning the 2010 and 2013 mayoralty elections respectively. He was replaced by this wife Erlinda Lim who won the 2016 election and became the first ever woman to serve as mayor of Lupon.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is located on the south- eastern side of Mindanao. Barangays Mati is politically subdivided into 26 barangays. In 1957, the barrio then known as Cabuaya was renamed to Dawan. Etymology Mati comes from the Mandayan word Maa-ti which refers to the town's creek that easily dries up even after heavy rain. Pioneer settlers were tribes Kalagan, Mandayan, and Maranao which carried strong Arabic and Indo- Malayan influences. History Dahican Beach at Mati = Spanish period = Captain Prudencio Garcia, the pioneer political-military head in 1861, and his comrade Juan Nazareno founded Mati and two other towns in Davao Oriental. = American period = By 1903, Mati was declared a municipality by virtue of Act No. 21. By 1907, Act No. 189 further reaffirmed the establishment of its local government. Francisco Rojas was the first appointed mayor while the first elected mayor was Patricio Cunanan in 1923. Mati became the capital of Davao Oriental in 1967. = Japanese occupation and World War II = The Japanese Imperial forces landed in town and occupied most of eastern Davao region in 1942. Mati was liberated in 1945 by the Allied Philippine Commonwealth troops of the 6th, 10th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th, 106th, 107th and 110th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 10th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the Davaoe√±o guerrilla units. = Contemporary Period = Mati celebrated its grand centennial in 2003. Cityhood issues The Baywalk of Mati On June 20, 2007, the Commission on Elections officially proclaimed the ratification of Republic Act 9408 converting the Municipality of Mati into a component city. There were 18,267 actual voters out of the 51,287 registered voters in 26 villages and 266 polling precincts during the June 18 plebiscite. Final tabulation showed Yes ‚Äì 18,267 votes (%); No ‚Äì 846 (1.6%).Sun.Star Davao - Mati now a city Demographics Mati is the fifth largest city/municipality in Davao Region, after Davao City, Tagum, Panabo, and Digos. = Ethnicity and Languages= Cebuano is the most widely spoken language and the corresponding ethnicity (which includes the Boholano subgroup) accounts for 71.55% of the total household population according to a 2000 census. Mandaya ranks second with 12.74%, followed by Kalagan with 6.87%. Most residents of Mati are descendants of migrants from the Visayas who came for employment opportunities in logging, mining, farming, fishing, trading and teaching. = Religion = Roman Catholicism is the major religious group, comprising the 80% of the total population. Islam comes in second with 8 percent, Iglesia Ni Cristo comes in third comprising with 6 percent. A small number of believers of other Christian groups like the United Church of Christ and Seventh Day Adventist are in the city as well. The Cathedral of San Nicolas de Tolentino is the center of Diocese of Mati under the jurisdiction of Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Davao. Two parishes are in Mati: one in the town center and one in Barangay Dawan. Climate Economy This region is linked to the markets of Mindanao, Malaysia and Indonesia. Most of the local people rely on agriculture and agro-industries for a living. Exports include bananas, pineapples, coconuts and fish. Because of its tropical nature and beaches, tourism is a rapidly growing business. Mining is also a contributor to the city's economy, due to the large deposits of copper in the city outskirts. =Industry= Utilities Mati is served by the Davao Oriental Electric Cooperative for its power needs. The Mati City Water District, on the other hand, is the local water provider for the city. =Tourism= Pujada Bay and Sleeping Dinosaur Island, view from Badas Point Mati offers beautiful landscapes and a number of beautiful resorts. The Provincial Capitol building and park rises atop the hill commanding a fantastic view of the Pujada Bay. Other locations that offer a bird's-eye view of the city are the Mati Tourism Complex and Badas Viewdeck. Dahican Beach Mati has always been known as a beach destination, with foreigners flocking to the city to enjoy what its beaches have to offer. Dahican is one of the most popular destinations in Mati with its 2-kilometer pure, fine white sand shore. It has recently become a prime destination for surfers and skimboarders. Pujada Bay boasts thousands of species of sea life and has been considered as among the richest bays in Southeast Asia. As such, locals take measures to preserve the diversity of marine life, protecting animals like lobsters, sea cows (locally known as Dugong), bottlenose dolphins, hammerhead sharks, manta rays and different kinds of turtles. Recently, skimboarding, surfing, and frisbee sports have established a wide fandom among young locals with Dahican being the favorite hub for tournaments in the region. Mati is home to three protected areas, the Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary, Mati Protected Landscape, and Pujada Bay Protected Landscape and Seascape. Mindanao SAGA Flying Club The Quicksilver Sport 2S of the Mindanao SAGA Flying Club flying over Dahican Beach The Mindanao SAGA Flying Club (MSFC), located at the Mati National Airport in Barangay Dahican, is an Ultralight aircraft flying facility that offers trial flights and flying lessons. Fast becoming the major attraction in Mati, MSFC has introduced a safe, affordable, and an exciting way to see the majestic scenery of the city like no one has seen before. The Quicksilver Sport 2S ultralight is the favorite of visitors owing to its open cockpit that gives the passenger an unrestricted view of the landscape and the feeling of ultimate freedom in the air. One of the attraction in Mati Park and Baywalk. Subangan Museum Inaugurated in January 2014, Subangan is the provincial museum. It features interactive, state-of-the-art exhibits. The centerpiece is a 53-feet skeleton of a sperm whale, considered the largest on display in the whole country. The museum also features exhibits on UNESCO World Heritage Site Mount Hamiguitan and Davao Oriental's history. Culture and Festivals Mati celebrates two annual grand festivals: the Pujada Bay Festival every June, and the Sambuokan Festival every October. Compared to the Kadayawan of Davao and other festivals, both of Mati's are relatively new. The Pujada Bay Festival started in 2004 to promote and protect the Pujada Bay, while the Sambuokan Festival started in 2001 to unite Matinians during the commemoration of the municipality's founding anniversary every October 29. In years, both festivals have become alternative tourist destinations as competitors from various regions in the country start pouring in for competitions like streetdancing, boat racing, skimboarding, and frisbee. Education Mati City is the educational center of the province of Davao Oriental. The state university of the province, the Davao Oriental State University, is in Dahican, as is the Davao Oriental Regional Science High School. There are two other colleges in the city: Mati Polytechnic College and Mati Doctors College. In basic education, seven private schools, sixteen public high schools, and a number of public elementary schools are located in the city. The City Schools Division of Mati supervises these schools. Transportation The pedicab or tricycle is the major means of transportation around the city. In recent years, underbone motorcycles have earned quite a popularity among professionals and students, thus easily becoming a public transport alternative to commuters who prefer more speed. Jeepneys are available for travels from Mati to its neighboring towns while vans and buses are still the only means of transportation from Mati to other cities. Mati Airport is scheduled to operate, with Cebu Pacific offering Mati-Cebu direct flights. There is also a seaport in Mati. The Mati Seaport in Pujada Bay is one of only three seaports in the whole province of Davao Oriental.

A small community of 958 residents (as of the 2011 census), Hornby is home to many artists, retired professionals, small business owners, remote workers, and young families who share a love of rural island life. Over the past 30 years, the island has become a coveted destination and its population easily quadruples in size during the summer months. The shoulder seasons are a preferred time for hiking, mountain biking, marine activities, weddings, and retreats. Most people reach the island by ferries from Buckley Bay, Vancouver Island. A growing number of private boats also visit through mooring at the Ford Cove Marina or anchoring at Tribune Bay. The closest airport is Comox Valley Airport in Comox, which provides regional, national, and international service. The primary destinations on Hornby are Tribune Bay Provincial Park, Helliwell Provincial Park, Ford's Cove, Heron Rocks and Whaling Station Bay. The island is also a popular mountain biking destination, with a variety of designated trails in Mount Geoffrey Regional Nature Park, Mount Geoffrey Escarpment Provincial Park and Crown Land. The total land area is , of which 40% is parkland. Island geology and history Pedro L√≥pez de Lerena Cuenca The island is geographically distinctive as it was formed by post-glacial rebound with the retreat of the last ice age. Before the arrival of European settlers, the island was inhabited by the Pentlatch, a Coast Salish First Nations band who called the Island Ja-dai-aich, meaning The Outer Island. The island was found and named Isla de Lerena during the 1791 voyage of the Spanish ship Santa Saturnina, under Juan Carrasco and Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez. The name honors the Spanish Finance Minister, Don Pedro L√≥pez de Lerena, who supported the movement of Spanish Ships over there. In 1850 the British renamed it after Rear Admiral Phipps Hornby, then Commander of the Pacific Station. Vegetation and soils A rocky beach on Hornby Island Hornby Island is mostly covered by mixed forest dominated by Douglas-fir. Western red cedar, western hemlock, grand fir and lodgepole pine are the other large conifers present. The smaller Pacific yew is scattered in the understorey. The arbutus, a broadleaf evergreen species, is plentiful. Broadleaf deciduous trees include bigleaf maple, red alder, black cottonwood, Pacific flowering dogwood, cascara and several species of willow. Populations of Garry oak occur on the southern end of the island and at Helliwell Provincial Park. Only about of undisturbed stands for older forest have been identified on Hornby Island, which amount to roughly 3.5% of the island's area. There are roughly of older second-growth stands on the island, which amount to 19% of the island. The island's soils have developed from marine deposits of variable texture, except for the higher elevations and steeper slopes where weathered clastic sedimentary rock provides the parent material. Most of Hornby's soils are sandy or gravelly, but some deep black loams occur in the northwestern part and many of the sands at the southern end have loam-textured topsoils. Podzols are common and the bleached sand grains associated with their eluvial (A2, Ae or E) horizons lend a salt-and-pepper appearance to many forest trails. In most cases, though, the E is not very thick and may be discontinuous. On this account, the soils were mostly classified as Brown Podzolic in a soil survey published in 1959. All of the island's soils are strongly acidic in their natural state except for those which have developed on shoreline shell middens. Fossils Fossil collectors have found Ammonite and Baculite fossils at Boulder Point on Hornby Island. A species of saurodontid fish (previously considered a pterosaur) called Gwawinapterus beardi was identified based on a fossil found on a beach on Hornby Island.http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2011/01/10/science- pterosaur-bc-horby-island-arbour.html References External links * Hornby Island Commerce Website * Hornby Island Residents' & Ratepayers' Association * 2006 census data * Helliwell Provincial Park * Tribune Bay Provincial Park Category:Populated places in the Comox Valley Regional District Category:Islands of the Gulf Islands Category:Designated places in British Columbia ","title":"Hornby Island"},{"id":"2154663","text":"of phloroglucinol Phloroglucinol is an organic compound with the formula C6H3(OH)3. It is a colorless solid. It is used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and explosives. Phloroglucinol is one of three isomeric benzenetriols. The other two isomers are hydroxyquinol (1,2,4-benzenetriol) and pyrogallol (1,2,3-benzenetriol). Phloroglucinol, and its benzenetriol isomers, are still defined as \\"phenols\\" according to the IUPAC official nomenclature rules of chemical compounds. Many such monophenolics are often termed \\"polyphenols\\" by the cosmetic and parapharmaceutical industries, which does not match the scientifically accepted definition. Synthesis and occurrence In 1855, phloroglucinol was first prepared from phloretin by the Austrian chemist Heinrich Hlasiwetz (1825‚Äì1875).See: * On p. 120, Hlasiwetz named phloroglucin: \\"Die auffallendste Eigenschaft dieses K√∂rpers ist, da≈øs er √ºberaus s√º≈øs schmeckt, we≈øshalb er bis auf weiteres Phloroglucin genannt sein mag.\\" (The most striking property of this substance is that it tastes extremely sweet, for which reason it may be named \\"phloroglucin\\" until further [information emerges].) *Thorpe, Edward, ed., A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry (London, England: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1913), vol. 4, 183. A modern synthesis of involves hydrolysis of benzene-1,3,5-triamine and its derivatives. Representative is the following route from trinitrobenzene. :600px The synthesis is noteworthy because ordinary aniline derivatives are unreactive toward hydroxide. Because the triaminobenzene also exists as its imine tautomer, it is susceptible to hydrolysis.  Reactions =Tautomerism and acid-base behavior= Phloroglucinol is a weak triprotic acid. The first two pKa's are 8.5 and 8.9. As an enol, phloroglucinol in principle exists in equilibrium with keto tautomers. Evidence for this equilibrium is provided by the formation of the oxime: :C6H3(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 NH2OH ‚Üí (CH2)3(C=NOH)3 \\\\+ 3 H2O But it behaves also like a benzenetriol as the three hydroxyl groups can be methylated to give 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene. For the neutral compound, the keto tautomers are undetectable spectroscopically. Upon deprotonation, the keto tautomer predominates. =Other reactions= From water, phloroglucinol crystallizes as the dihydrate, which has a melting point of 116‚Äì117 ¬∞C, but the anhydrous form melts at a much higher temperature, at 218‚Äì220 ¬∞C. It does not boil intact, but it does sublime. The Hoesch reaction allows the synthesis of 1-(2,4,6-Trihydroxyphenyl)ethanone from phloroglucinol. Leptospermone can be synthesized from phloroglucinol by a reaction with isovaleroylnitrile in the presence of a zinc chloride catalyst. Pentacarbon dioxide, described in 1988 by G√ºnter Maier and others, can be obtained by pyrolysis of 1,3,5-cyclohexanetrione (phloroglucin). Phloroglucinol readily forms 5-aminoresorcinol (aka Phloramine) in aqueous ammonia at low temperatures. phloroglucinol & phloretic acid gives 30% yield of phloretin.  Natural occurrences  Phloroglucinol is also generally found in the flavonoid ring A substitution pattern. Indeed, it was originally prepared from phloretin, a compound isolated from fruit trees, using potassium hydroxide. Additionally, the compound can be similarly prepared from glucosides, plant extracts and resins such as quercetin, catechin and phlobaphenes. Phloroglucinols are secondary metabolites that occur naturally in certain plant species. It is also produced by brown algae and bacteria. Acyl dervatives are present in the fronds of the coastal woodfern, Dryopteris arguta or in Dryopteris crassirhizoma. The anthelmintic activity of the root of Dryopteris filix-mas has been claimed to be due to flavaspidic acid, a phloroglucinol derivative. Formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) can be found in Eucalyptus species. Hyperforin and adhyperforin are two phloroglucinols found in St John's wort. Humulone is a phloroglucinol derivative with three isoprenoid side-chains. Two side-chains are prenyl groups and one is an isovaleryl group. Humulone is a bitter-tasting chemical compound found in the resin of mature hops (Humulus lupulus). Brown algae, such as Ecklonia stolonifera, Eisenia bicyclis or species in the genus Zonaria, produce phloroglucinol and phloroglucinol derivatives. Brown algae also produce a type of tannins known as phlorotannins. The bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens produces phloroglucinol, phloroglucinol carboxylic acid and diacetylphloroglucinol.  Biosynthesis  3,5-diketoheptanedioate. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, biosynthesis of phloroglucinol is performed with a type III polyketide synthase. The synthesis begins with the condensation of three malonyl-CoAs. Then decarboxylation followed by the cyclization of the activated 3,5-diketoheptanedioate product leads to the formation of phloroglucinol. The enzyme pyrogallol hydroxytransferase uses 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene (pyrogallol) to produce 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene (phloroglucinol) and 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene. It is found in the bacterium species Pelobacter acidigallici. The enzyme phloroglucinol reductase uses dihydrophloroglucinol and NADP+ to produce phloroglucinol, NADPH, and H+. It is found in the bacterium species Eubacterium oxidoreducens. The legume-root nodulating, microsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium species Bradyrhizobium japonicum is able to degrade catechin with formation of phloroglucinol carboxylic acid, further decarboxylated to phloroglucinol, which is dehydroxylated to resorcinol and hydroxyquinol. Phloretin hydrolase uses phloretin and water to produce phloretate and phloroglucinol.  Health effects  It is also used as a treatment for gallstones, spasmodic pain and other related gastrointestinal disorders. Whether for labour pains, abortion pains or benign gynaecologic pains, the results found are insufficient to promote the use of this drug in these indications. Phloroglucinols acylated derivatives have a fatty acid synthase inhibitory activity. = ATC classification= It has the A03AX12 code in the A03AX Other drugs for functional bowel disorders section of the ATC code A03 Drugs for functional gastrointestinal disorders subgroup of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System. It also has the D02.755.684 code in the D02 Organic chemicals section of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) codes by the United States National Library of Medicine.  Applications  Phloroglucinol is mainly used as a coupling agent in printing. It links diazo dyes to give a fast black. It is useful for the industrial synthesis of pharmaceuticals (Flopropione) and explosives (TATB (2,4,6-triamino-1,3,5-trinitrobenzene), trinitrophloroglucinol, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzeneA facile two-step Synthesis of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene. Bottaro Jeffrey C, Malhotra Ripudaman and Dodge Allen, Synthesis, 2004, no 4, pages 499-500, ). Phloroglucinolysis is an analytical technique to study condensed tannins by means of depolymerisation. The reaction makes use of phloroglucinol as nucleophile. Phlobaphenes formation (tannins condensation and precipitation) can be minimized in using strong nucleophiles, such as phloroglucinol, during pine tannins extraction. Phloroglucinol is used in plant culture media. It demonstrates both cytokinin-like and auxin-like activity. Phloroglucinol increases shoot formation and somatic embryogenesis in several horticultural and grain crops. When added to rooting media together with auxin, phloroglucinol further stimulates rooting. = Use in tests = Phloroglucinol is a reagent of the Tollens' test for pentoses. This test relies on reaction of the furfural with phloroglucinol to produce a colored compound with high molar absorptivity.Oshitna, K., and Tollens, B., Ueber Spectral-reactionen des Methylfurfurols. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 34, 1425 (1901) A solution of hydrochloric acid and phloroglucinol is also used for the detection of lignin (Wiesner test). A brilliant red color develops, owing to the presence of coniferaldehyde groups in the lignin.Lignin production and detection in wood. John M. Harkin, U.S. Forest Service Research Note FPL-0148, November 1966 (article) A similar test can be performed with tolonium chloride. It is also part of Gunzburg reagent, an alcoholic solution of phloroglucinol and vanillin, for the qualitative detection of free hydrochloric acid in gastric juice.

In 1999, NDTV launched its website. Channels operating NDTV Profit's Screen at Bombay Stock Exchange. Channels of NDTV Group are: * NDTV 24x724-hour English news channel. * NDTV India24-hour Hindi news channel. * NDTV ProfitBusiness news channel. * NDTV HOP - In October 2018, NDTV and Airtel announced the launch of NDTV HOP, a live channel for mobile devices which carries its content in the vertical/portrait aspect ratio rather than the traditional horizontal viewing mode. Notable personalities * Prannoy Roy, co-founder and one of India's earliest psephologists * Sonia Singh, Editorial Director * Nidhi Razdan, Executive editor * Sreenivasan Jain, Editor of NDTV 24x7 * Ravish Kumar, Editor of NDTV India (Hindi channel) * Sarah Jacob, Host of We the People Shahrukh Khan at the NDTV Greenathon at Yash Raj Studios. Visible is Prannoy Roy and Vikram Chandra. =Notable former associates= * Vikram A Chandra, CEO in 2016 (Left NDTV in 2016, and stopped presenting shows as a guest anchor in April 2019) * Barkha Dutt (19952017, Group Editor in 2015) * Rajdeep Sardesai * Suparna Singh (19942019, CEO 20172019) * Noopur Tiwari * Arnab Goswami Controversies =Corruption and criminal conspiracy= On 20 January 1998, Central Bureau of Investigation filed various cases against New Delhi Television (NDTV) managing director Prannoy Roy, former director general of Doordarshan R. Basu and five other top officials of Doordarshan under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act. According to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charge-sheet, Doordarshan suffered a loss of over due to the \\"undue favours\\" shown to NDTV as its programme The World This Week (TWTW) was put in 'A' category instead of 'special A' category. =Radia tapes controversy= In November 2010, OPEN magazine carried a story which reported transcripts of some of the telephone conversations of Nira Radia with senior journalists, politicians, and corporate houses, many of whom have denied the allegations. The Central Bureau of Investigation has announced that they have 5,851 recordings of phone conversations by Radia, some of which outline Radia's attempts to broker deals in relation to the 2G spectrum sale. The tapes appear to demonstrate how Radia attempted to use some media persons including NDTV's Barkha Dutt to influence the decision to appoint A. Raja as telecom minister. She left the channel in January 2017. =Tax fraud= NDTV, through its foreign subsidiaries have allegedly violated numerous Indian tax and corporate laws. NDTV has denied these allegations. Video on YouTube (1h 12m) The Sunday Guardian, a centre-left newspaper ran a story which exposed the NDTV's financial misdemeanours and malpractices in connivance with ICICI Bank. It provides details of how NDTV's major stakeholders raised funds by misdeclaration of the value of shares in NDTV. NDTV CEO claimed to the Sunday Guardian along with the threat of \\"criminal defamation\\". On 5 June 2017, the house of Prannoy Roy was raided by NIA and CBI. On 19 November 2015, the ED served notice to NDTV for alleged violations under the FEMA act, however the company said it has been advised that the allegations, while true are not \\"legally tenable\\". The \\"Income Tax Appellate Tribunal\\" (ITAT) has upheld an income tax department finding that promoters of NDTV used their own shell companies to round-trip investments of during 200910, making them liable for recovery of tax and penalty. Regarding an investment by the US TV network, NBC (an 80% subsidiary of GE at the time) into NDTV Networks of $150 million, both NDTV and NBC/GE insist was an absolutely legal and bona fide investment while the IT department claims it is an illegal transaction. NDTV has called it the Indian Authorities variant of \\"McCarthyism\\" to suppress the media. =Commonwealth Games contract= On 5 August 2011, Comptroller and Auditor General of India's report on XIX Commonwealth Games was tabled in Parliament of India. In section 14.4.2 of the report, CAG alleged that while awarding contracts worth for production and broadcast of commercials to promote CWG-2010 to NDTV and CNN-IBN, the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee followed an arbitrary approach. Proposals were considered in an ad-hoc manner, as and when a proposal was received; no form of competitive tendering was adopted. The CAG further said in its report that, \\"We had no assurance about the competitiveness of the rates quoted by these channels and the need and usefulness of these proposals. From March 2010 to June 2010, the entire pre games publicity and sponsorship publicity was done only on NDTV & CNN-IBN.\\" =Suit against TAM India= In 2012, NDTV alleged that TV rating measurement company TAM had indulged in malpractice of influencing and generating favourable TV ratings for their channel. They claimed that two TAM representatives had met NDTV staff in April with an offer to fix the TV ratings in 23 weeks by bribing viewers in homes (which otherwise are secret) where the measuring meters were installed. NDTV claimed that this malpractice had resulted in enormous losses for the company over several years and filed a case against TAM, TAM India and its global parent firms for $1.39 billion in the Supreme Court of New York. Subsequently, in 2014, the New York Supreme Court dismissed NDTV's petition citing that since it was based on activities and impact in India, NDTV needed to pursue the case in India instead of the US. =One-day ban= On 4 November 2016, the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting ordered the channel to go off air on 9 November for allegedly divulging 'strategically sensitive' details while covering January's deadly attack on the Pathankot air base. Government scrapped their decision on the ban for reasons not made clear. =2008 loan case= On 5 June 2017, the CBI raided premises of channel promoters Prannoy and Radika Roy, accusing it of \\"causing an alleged loss\\" to ICICI Bank of . The complainant, Sanjay Dutt, Director of Quantum Securities Pvt. Ltd., alleged that the Roys took a loan of around from ICICI in 200809, putting up their shareholdings in the company at an inflated value as collateral. He added that while the amount was repaid the following year, the accrued interest of remained unpaid. In its response, NDTV denied any \\"default on any loan to ICICI or any other bank\\", while attaching a picture of the bank's 2009 letter that confirmed that the \\"entire amount due,\\" amounting to , had \\"been repaid in full.\\" It added that, \\"No matter how much the politicians attack us - We will not give up the fight for freedom and the independence of media in India.\\" =2019= , Securities and Exchange Board of India barred NDTV chief Prannoy Roy and his wife Radhika Roy from accessing the securities market for 2 years after an investigation revealed that they concealed material info from shareholders regarding loan agreements and hence, they cannot hold management positions in NDTV board. In August 2019, its CEO Suparna Singh resigned after CBI booked promoters for alleged FDI norms violation. =Tanishq advertisement controversy= In early October Tanishq started an advertisement campaign, Ekatvam, that showed a Muslim household organising baby shower of a Hindu daughter in law. This caused a hashtag war on twitter. Members of BJP IT Cell and Social Media Committee tweeted against it. Tanishq subsequently withdrew the advertisement citing 'well being of their employees, partners and store staff'. On 14 October 2020 NDTV reported that a showroom in Kutch Gujarat was 'attacked', and later amended the report to the store being 'threatened'. Gujarat Police filed and FIR against NDTV on 16 October 2020 for 'false reporting'.

He was educated as a teacher and lawyer and considered one of the leading experts of the day on Quebec's municipal civil law. He was appointed a municipal court judge and a judge for the Exchequer Court of Canada. Weir published several individual poems in magazines and collections in books. His lyrics for the English version of \\"O Canada\\" eclipsed many others' lyrical attempts and songs to quickly become the most popular patriotic song in Canada for the past century. Early history Robert Stanley Weir was born in Hamilton, Canada West, the son of William Park Weir and Helen Craig Smith, who had emigrated from Scotland to Canada in 1852. Weir moved to Montreal, Quebec with his family as an infant, where his father became a Surveyor of Customs in the Port of Montreal. His brother, William Alexander Weir, was born there and would later become a Cabinet Minister in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. Weir studied at McGill Normal School, Montreal, and at the age of 19, was appointed principal of Sherbrooke Street School, one of the newest and largest Montreal public schools at the time. He continued his studies at McGill University earning his Bachelor of Civil Law in 1880 and a Doctor of Civil Law in 1897. In 1882, he married Margaret (Gertie) Alexander Douglas, daughter of wealthy Montreal businessman Alexander Douglas. They had six children, two sons, Douglas (the eldest), and Albert (Ronald) Weir, (1901 - 1944), and four daughters, Beatrice, Winnifred, Marjorie and Dorothy Douglas Weir. Marjorie Douglas Weir would become known for her role in a movement to provide children's playgrounds in Montreal. Robert himself was known to be Vice-President of the Parks & Playgrounds association, in 1922.1922 Annual report of the Parks & Playgrounds Association. McGill University Archives The family divided their time between Montreal and a summer home named Cedarhurst, in Cedarville,, part of Ogden, Quebec a picturesque hamlet on the east shore of Lac Memphr√©magog in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Career From 1881, Weir practised law in Montreal and took a particular interest in municipal questions and had several of his studies published. In 1892, he ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal for the Montreal No. 4 riding of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec. In 1898, he was one of several eminent advocates appointed to revise the charter of the City of Montreal. It is believed that, in particular, he wrote many of the sections relating to expropriations and the power of the city to pass by-laws. On May 6, 1899, he was appointed Recorder for Montreal. During this time as a recorder, he also taught liturgics and jurisprudence in the Congregational College of Canada, which was affiliated with McGill University. Weir later served as a municipal court judge and was considered an expert on the historical aspects of municipal law. He was later appointed a judge for the Exchequer Court of Canada in 1926. In 1923, he was honoured as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. =\\"O Canada\\"= In 1908, Weir wrote English lyrics for \\"O Canada\\" while at his summer home, Cedarhurst, in time to honour the 300th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City. The French version had originally been commissioned in 1880 by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Th√©odore Robitaille with lyrics by Sir Adolphe Basile Routhier and music composed by Calixa Lavall√©e in time for the ' which was to be held on St. Jean Baptiste Day of that year. The popularity of the song grew quickly in Quebec and was played frequently at special events in the province. English versions began to appear almost immediately. The first evidence of official use of any version of \\"O Canada\\" in Anglophone Canada was 1901, when school children sang it for that year's tour of Canada by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, later King George V and Queen Mary). By the time Weir wrote his version in 1908, there were more than a hundred English quasi-translations of the French original (whose lyrics have never changed). But it was Weir's version that became the most popular one. The tune was already popular across the country, and with Weir's popular lyrics \\"O Canada\\" swiftly joined \\"God Save the King\\" as co-national anthem by custom, though neither of them had been statutorily declared national anthems. At the time of confederation in 1867, many Anglophones advocated for \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\" to be their national anthem. But while it was often used alongside \\"God Save the King\\" at official functions in Anglophone areas of the country, no French version was ever produced making it impossible for that song to ever become Canada's national anthem. Other alternatives faced similar problems. Weir's original 1908 lyrics were:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/O-Canada-1908.pdf > O Canada! Our home, our native land. True patriot love thou dost in us > command. We see thee rising fair, dear land, The True North strong and free; > And stand on guard, O Canada, We stand on guard for thee. O Canada! O > Canada! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee! O Canada, we stand on guard > for thee! Weir amended the lyrics slightly in 1913, 1914https://www.loc.gov/resource/ihas.100006817.0/?sp=1 and 1916, ultimately producing the following version: > O Canada! Our home and native land. True patriot love in all thy sons > command. With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and > free! And stand on guard, O Canada! We stand on guard for thee. O Canada, > glorious and free. We stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee! O Canada! > We stand on guard for thee! One final change was made to the penultimate line after Weir died - and is preserved in a recording made by tenor Edward Johnson in 1928: > O Canada, glorious and free, We stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee! > O Canada! We stand on guard for thee! Became: > O Canada! Glorious and free! O Canada! We stand on guard for thee! O Canada! > We stand on guard for thee! But the 1916 version continued to be used for official occasions until 1980, when Parliament changed the lyrics upon statutory adoption of \\"O Canada\\" as the national anthem (still with no change to the original French lyrics): > O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons > command. With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and > free! From far and wide, O Canada, We stand on guard for thee. God keep our > land glorious and free! O Canada, We stand on guard for thee. O Canada, We > stand on guard for thee. On February 7, 2018, legislation that proposed to change the line \\"True patriot love in all thy sons command\\" to \\"True patriot love in all of us command\\" received royal assent, and the change became law. Death and legacy Cedarhurst, at Lac Memphr√©magog where Weir wrote \\"O Canada\\" Judge Robert Stanley Weir died on August 20, 1926 at Lac Memphr√©magog, Quebec, Canada. Weir's verses of \\"O Canada\\" were published in an official form for the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation in 1927, and gradually became the most generally accepted anthem in English-speaking Canada, completely winning out over the alternatives by the 1960s. In seeking to enact \\"O Canada\\" as the national anthem officially, a Special Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons was struck. In 1968, the committee recommended changes to the English version‚Äìreplacing one of the repeated phrases \\"We stand on guard for thee\\" with \\"From far and wide\\" and one \\"O Canada\\" with \\"God keep our land\\". The committee also thought it appropriate for the government to acquire copyright to the words and music. Canadian copyright laws held for 50 years beyond the author's death so there was no trouble with the copyright for the music but the heirs of Weir objected to the changes to the words. Since Weir died in 1926, it would not be in the public domain until 1976. Evidence was found that the copyright had actually descended to Gordon V. Thompson, a music publisher, who agreed to sell it to the government in 1970 for the nominal sum of $1. The committee, however, still hoped to settle the matter amicably with Weir's family, if at all possible. Finally, on July 1, 1980, 100 years after Routhier and Lavall√©e penned the hymn, the National Anthem Act officially proclaimed the French and modified English versions as the National Anthem of Canada. Today, \\"God Save the Queen\\" is Canada's royal anthem, while \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\" is rarely heard. Two provinces have adopted Latin translations of phrases from the English lyrics as their mottos: Manitoba --Gloriosus et liber (glorious and free)-- and Alberta --Fortis et liber (strong and free). Similarly, the motto of Canadian Forces Land Force Command is Vigilamus pro te (we stand on guard for thee). As well, the motto for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics was \\"with glowing hearts\\". A postage stamp was issued in honour of Weir, Lavall√©e, and Routhier on June 6, 1980 and on May 24, 1999, a monument for Judge Weir was erected in Weir Memorial Park, on the shores of Lac Memphr√©magog, near where he wrote the famous lyrics. A Montreal street is named ' in his honour. Rue Stanley Weir Montr√©al, QC Google Maps In recent years, the English version of the anthem has been criticized, by feminists such as Senator Vivienne Poy, for being sexist (\\"true patriot love in all thy sons command\\"); alternate lyrics (\\"in all of us command\\", \\"in all our hearts command\\" or \\"thou dost in us command\\") have been proposed but are not widely supported. Weir's grandson, Steve Simpson, says the word \\"son\\" is not about gender, but a reference to a patriotic command from a maternal goddess.Harper gov't says Canadian anthem lyrics won't change.

More specifically, several Paenibacillus species serve as efficient plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which competitively colonize plant roots and can simultaneously act as biofertilizers and as antagonists (biopesticides) of recognized root pathogens, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes.Bloemberg GV, Lugtenberg BJ: Molecular basis of plant growth promotion and biocontrol by rhizobacteria. Curr Opin Plant Biol 2001, 4:343-350. They enhance plant growth by several direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct mechanisms include phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, degradation of environmental pollutants, and hormone production. Indirect mechanisms include controlling phytopathogens by competing for resources such as iron, amino acids and sugars, as well as by producing antibiotics or lytic enzymes.Kloepper JW, Leong J, Teintze M, Schroth MN: Enhanced plant growth by siderophores produced by plant growth- promoting rhizobacteria. Nature 1980, 286:885-886.Ryu CM, Farag MA, Hu CH, Reddy MS, Wei HX, Pare PW, Kloepper JW: Bacterial volatiles promote growth in Arabidopsis. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2003, 100:4927-4932. Competition for iron also serves as a strong selective force determining the microbial population in the rhizosphere. Several studies show that PGPR exert their plant growth-promoting activity by depriving native microflora of iron. Although iron is abundant in nature, the extremely low solubility of Fe at pH 7 means that most organisms face the problem of obtaining enough iron from their environments. To fulfill their requirements for iron, bacteria have developed several strategies, including the reduction of ferric to ferrous ions, the secretion of high-affinity iron-chelating compounds, called siderophores, and the uptake of heterologous siderophores. P. vortex's genome, for example, harbors many genes which are employed in these strategies, in particular it has the potential to produce siderophores under iron-limiting conditions. Despite the increasing interest in Paenibacillus spp., genomic information of these bacteria is lacking. More extensive genome sequencing could provide fundamental insights into pathways involved in complex social behavior of bacteria, and can discover a source of genes with biotechnological potential. Candidatus Paenibacillus glabratella causes white nodules and high mortality of Biomphalaria glabrata freshwater snails. This is potentially important because Biomphalaria glabrata is an intermediate host of schistosomiasis. Pattern formation, self-organization, and social behaviors Several Paenibacillus species can form complex patterns on semisolid surfaces. Development of such complex colonies require self- organization and cooperative behavior of individual cells while employing sophisticated chemical communication.Bassler BL, Losick R: Bacterially speaking.

P. vortex organizes its colonies by generating modules, each consisting of many bacteria, which are used as building blocks for the colony as a whole. The modules are groups of bacteria that move around a common center at about 10 ¬µm/s. =Pattern forming in P. dendritiformis= An additional intriguing pattern forming Paenibacillus species is P. dendritiformis, which generates two different morphotypes ‚Äì the branching (or tip-splitting) morphotype and the chiral morphotype that is marked by curly branches with well-defined handedness (see pictures). These two pattern-forming Paenibacillus strains exhibit many distinct physiological and genetic traits, including Œ≤-galactosidase-like activity causing colonies to turn blue on X-gal plates and multiple drug resistance (MDR) (including septrin, penicillin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, streptomycin, and mitomycin C). Colonies that are grown on surfaces in Petri dishes exhibit several-fold higher drug resistance in comparison to growth in liquid media. This particular resistance is believed to be due to a surfactant-like liquid front that actually forms a particular pattern on the Petri plate.

It was filmed mostly in the vicinity of Moab, Utah. Plot Harvard educated Dr. David Lowell's (Collins) research is carried out in the canyon country of southern Utah and must be conducted at the same time Halley's Comet is passing over the earth. Lowell is trying to find a safe, cheap energy source. Lowell leased the land from the Pilgrim Corporation. However, the Pilgrim Corporation decides the same canyon would be better used as a remote place to illegally dump nuclear waste. Pilgrim's CEO (Nicholas Pryor) arranges for Lowell to be thrown off his land and destroys his laboratory. Lowell spends the rest of the film committing sabotage against the company and trying to recover his land, assisted by the daughter of Pilgrim's CEO (Janet Julian) as well as unlikely help from a hit-man sympathetic to Lowell's cause (Bo Svenson). Brook Alistair (Lance Henriksen), hired by the Pilgrim Corporation attempts to stop Lowell. Production Parts of the film were shot at Onion Creek, Professor Valley, the Moab Sand Flats, Dead Horse Point, Byrd's Ranch, Squaw Park, and Moab in Utah. Release Release of the film was delayed so it would coincide with the passing of Halley's Comet over the earth in 1986. Soundtrack The Mike + The Mechanics song \\"Silent Running\\" was chosen to appear in Choke Canyon because its atmosphere suited the film's tone.Neer, Dan (1985). Mike on Mike [interview LP], Atlantic Recording Corporation. For promotional reasons, the song's title was extended to \\"Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)\\" (the parenthetical title being the title of the film in the UK), even though the lyrics have no connection to the film. The promotional video for the song features a few clips from the film, but primarily follows the story of the lyrics, which are about an astronaut trying to send a message to the past in order to warn his family of an imminent societal breakdown. Reception TV Guide gave the movie two out of five stars, finding the film fun as it doesn't take itself too seriously, but found the directing to be somewhat lacking.https://www.tvguide.com/movies/choke-canyon/review/110855/ Creature Feature gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars, saying that it was a rousing adventure, although light on science fiction content.

The player takes the role of an Antarctic penguin, racing to disparate research stations owned by different countries in Antarctica (excluding the USSR). The gameplay is similar to Sega's Turbo, but plays at a much slower pace, and features platform game elements. The penguin, later named Penta, must reach the next station before time runs out while avoiding sea lions and breaks in the ice. Throughout the levels, fish jump out of ice holes and can be caught for bonus points. The game, like many early video games, has no ending - when the player reaches the last station, the game starts from the first level again, but with increased difficulty. Legacy Antarctic Adventure was followed by a sequel for the MSX computer in 1986, entitled Penguin Adventure. In addition, the penguin character Penta, and his son Pentarou became a mascot for Konami through the 1980s. They have made appearances in over 10 games. Of particular note are his appearances in the Parodius series of shoot 'em up games. Penta, or his son Pentarou, had appeared in the Medal Games like Tsurikko Penta, Balloon Penta and Imo Hori Penta.

Located 17 km north of downtown Varna, it is virtually connected to the city by a continuous swath of resorts and villa communities. It is a popular tourist destination, drawing many visitors from Romania, Ukraine, Poland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, Scandinavia, France, Central and Eastern Europe, the Persian Gulf, Israel, and other countries. Transportation Golden Sands is served by several regular bus lines of the Varna public transit system. Buses 9, 89 and 109 connect the resort to Varna Railway Station, bus 409 connects to Varna International Airport via the city centre and buses 209 and 309 connect to other areas of Varna.  Development  The coast around Golden Sands with the neighbouring nature park in the foreground The old-growth forests between ancient Odessos and Dionysopolis were first mentioned by Pliny as the home of mythical dwarfs, visited by the Argonauts. Byzantine sources name the local fortress Gerania; there are 4th-7th century AD remains of massive stone ramparts and a basilica along the edge of the Franga plateau. The cave Aladzha Monastery, 3 km to the west, was a monastic centre from antiquity through the Second Bulgarian Empire. In the days of the Ottoman Empire, Uzunkum () was known as a hideaway for outlaws. It was largely uninhabited until the 1950s, although used for outings. Resort development started in 1957 and in about two decades, the place was transformed into a modern holiday complex with numerous hotels (many open year-round), villas, apartment buildings, spa centres, restaurants, clubs, casinos, attractions, shopping centres, and sports facilities, including a yacht marina, a horse riding school, and the Aquapolis water park. Golden Sands was privatized in the 1990s and attracted considerable investment through the 2000s. Designed initially for 13,000 hotel beds, it had over 30,000 beds reported in 2007; according to Varna Tourist Chamber sources, the actual number was significantly higher,http://www.moreto.net/novini.php?n=20254 by some unverified critical estimates even approaching 90,000.https://web.archive.org/web/20110719053107/http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2667&sectionid;=5&id;=0001401 Currently, most hotels offer all-inclusive vacations, but there are also concerted efforts to reposition the resort as a high-end destination. The area is labelled to have the purest quartz sand on the coast and abounds in old trees, landscaped gardens, and pedestrian malls. Golden Sands authorities resist demands to provide more automobile roads and car parks, citing the resort's reputation as family friendly, green, and a largely pedestrian place. Hot mineral water springs and lush woodlands cascading from the Franga Plateau, forming the Golden Sands Nature Park, turn the town into one of the most popular tourist spots in Eastern Europe. It also comprises the Holiday Club Riviera luxury resort, several villa communities including Panorama, Chaika, Kabakum, and Alen Mak, and the historic grotto of Aladzha Monastery in the vicinity. A contemporary chapel of John the Baptist was recently added. Just north is perhaps the best known gay beach in the nation. Three 18-hole golf courses designed by Gary Player and Ian Woosnam are currently (2007) being developed around Balchik and Kavarna a short drive to the north. A view of the beach and hotel complexes Golden Sands urban development took place within a protected area declared in 1943 (its original name was Hachuka State Forest); some nature landmarks were lost in the process, such as beach freshwater ponds abounding in tortoises and snakes and beach nesting bird habitats. But the bulk of the nature park was preserved and its area expanded almost twice to over 1,300 hectares. In the 2000s, although Golden Sands managed to a large extent to avoid being overdeveloped as other large resorts were, parts of the protected forest adjacent to the urban area were cleared for the construction of the Aquapolis water park. In 2007, a larger-capacity water purification plant was also badly needed. The scenic route Varna-Golden Sands, ruptured by a small landslide caused by overdevelopment in the Lipov Kladenets villa district in 2004, remained closed and all traffic redirected to inland roads. In 2007, all roads proved inadequate to handle an unexpected surge of Romanian motorists looking for all-inclusive deals during the Easter and May Day vacations, causing massive traffic jams and accidents.

It is down the line from and is situated on the main line between to the south and to the north. The station is Grade II listed. Newark-on-Trent is a market town, 25 miles (40 km) east of Nottingham. Newark has another station, Newark Castle, operated by East Midlands Railway and closer to the town centre. History The station is on the Great Northern Railway Towns Line from Peterborough to Doncaster which opened on 15 July 1852, the easier to construct Fens Loop Line via Boston and Lincoln had opened two years earlier.Body, p.116 The station opened without any ceremony. The first train of passengers from the north arrived at 6.38 am and those from the south arrived at 8.05 am. The buildings comprised a booking-office, cloak room, first and second class ladies‚Äô and other waiting rooms, and a large refreshment room by , and a smaller one by . The platforms were long, with awnings provided for of their length. There was a coal depot, goods warehouse and sheds to accommodate 4 locomotives. The station became a junction in 1879 with the opening of the Great Northern Railway branch to Bottesford, built as a northern extension of the Great Northern and London and North Western Joint Railway which opened at the same time. Services from Newark were provided to Northampton or Leicester and also to Nottingham. Services onto the joint line from Newark were withdrawn by 1922.Bradshaws Railway Guide, July 1922. The line was much used for through goods, especially between Newark and Northampton. The joint line closed in 1962 except for isolated fragments, but the Newark to Bottesford Junction section survived until 1988. On 9 July 1928, King George V and Queen Mary arrived at the station from King's Cross where they were received by the 6th Duke of Portland. The short connection to the Newark Castle to Lincoln line was opened in 1965 by British Rail to maintain a link between the East Coast Main Line and Lincoln following the closure of the branch from the latter to Grantham. This remains in use today by trains to Lincoln and Grimsby.\\"Network Rail study proposes new platform at Lincoln station and faster trains to Nottingham\\" Pidluznyj, S, The Lincolnite news article, 12 March 2018, Retrieved 17 June 2019 =Station masters= *Mr. Easterfield ca. 1861 - 1882 (afterwards station master at Stamford) *Alfred Mason 1882 - 1895 *Arthur Joseph Pott 1895 - 1902 (afterwards station master at Grantham) *Charles Cooper 1902 \\\\- 1910 (formerly station master at Essendine) *John Thomas Chandler 1910 - 1925 *F.G.

The East Coast Main Line is crossed by the Nottingham-Lincoln line. Trains on the East Coast Main Line not calling at Newark North Gate have to slow from to at the crossing. There are plans to grade-separate the crossing by providing a flyover for east‚Äìwest services, with a shallow enough gradient to accommodate freight trains. A key geographical constraint on the construction of a flyover will be the proximity of the site to the River Trent and the A1 trunk road. The benefits of a flyover would include higher capacity on both the East Coast Main Line and the Nottingham-Lincoln line, for both passengers and freight; journey time improvements; and a more reliable timetable. Network Rail's final Route Utilisation Strategy for the East Midlands estimated that a flyover would have a benefit:cost ratio of 1.4, with further benefits which could not be taken account of in the standard project appraisal procedures. The RUS recommended that the provision of a flyover at Newark was further developed in Control Period 4 (2009‚Äì2014) to refine the infrastructure costs and potential benefits, with the possibility of constructing it in Control Period 5 (2014‚Äì2019).

These basins are also called \\"dry ponds\\", \\"holding ponds\\" or \\"dry detention basins\\" if no permanent pool of water exists. Detention ponds that are designed to permanently retain some volume of water at all times are called retention basins. In its basic form, a detention basin is used to manage water quantity while having a limited effectiveness in protecting water quality, unless it includes a permanent pool feature.United States Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC.\\"National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices.\\" Fact Sheet: \\"Dry Detention Ponds.\\" Functions and design Detention basins are storm water best management practices that provide general flood protection and can also control extreme floods such as a 1 in 100-year storm event.Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta, GA. \\"Georgia Stormwater Management Manual.\\" Section 3.4.1: \\"Dry Detention / Dry ED Basins.\\" August 2001. The basins are typically built during the construction of new land development projects including residential subdivisions or shopping centers. The ponds help manage the excess urban runoff generated by newly constructed impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots and rooftops. A basin functions by allowing large flows of water to enter but limits the outflow by having a small opening at the lowest point of the structure. The size of this opening is determined by the capacity of underground and downstream culverts and washes to handle the release of the contained water.Dykehouse, Terry, P.E. Jones and Edmunds, Gainesville, FL.\\"Retention Ponds and Detention Ponds, The Recovery Process.\\" Frequently the inflow area is constructed to protect the structure from some types of damage. Offset concrete blocks in the entrance spillways are used to reduce the speed of entering flood water. These structures may also have debris drop vaults to collect large rocks. These vaults are deep holes under the entrance to the structure. The holes are wide enough to allow large rocks and other debris to fall into the holes before they can damage the rest of the structure. These vaults must be emptied after each storm event. =New approaches= Research has shown that detention basins built with real-time control of the outflow from the basin are significantly more effective at retaining total suspended solids and associated contaminants, such as heavy metals, when compared to basins without control. Extended detention basin A variant basin design called an extended detention dry basin can limit downstream erosion and control of some pollutants such as suspended solids. This basin type differs from a retention basin, also known as a \\"wet pond,\\" which includes a permanent pool of water, and which is typically designed to protect water quality.Water Environment Federation, Alexandria, VA; and American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA. \\"Urban Runoff Quality Management.\\" WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. . Chapter 5.James Worth Bagley College. \\"Detention Basins.\\" Chapter 4: Best Management Practices. Agricultural and Biological Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. \\"Stormwater Detention Ponds.\\" Chapter 5, Minnesota State Permit Guidance Document. While basic detention ponds are often designed to empty within 6 to 12 hours after a storm, extended detention (ED) dry basins improve on the basic detention design by lengthening the storage time, for example, to 24 or 48 hours. Longer storage times tend to result in improved water quality because additional suspended solids are removed.

The station is owned by Word of God Fellowship. The station's transmitter is located atop South Mountain. It is carried in the Phoenix metro area by the Qwest Choice cable system in the basic tier, but is not carried by Cox Cable, as they have opted to carry the national Daystar feed on their digital tier. History An original construction permit for low-power television station K64DR, channel 64, was granted to Broadcasting Systems, Inc. on August 23, 1989. The station was quickly built and was licensed on October 31, just two months later. It was affiliated with Telemundo and aired very little local programming. In December 1990, the station was sold to Hispanic Broadcasters of Arizona, Inc., and in 1996, when LPTV stations were allowed to acquire four-letter calls, they changed their call letters to KDRX- LP, which incorporated their original assigned calls, K64DR. In October 1997, KDRX-LP added a Spanish-language newscast produced locally by English-language ABC affiliate KNXV (channel 15). They would begin producing their own newscast a few years later, after moving into KNXV's former Phoenix studio facility.Eileen Davis Hudson, \\"Phoenix\\". Mediaweek 11.2 (Jan 8, 2001): 12-18. The station was sold to Apogeo Television Phoenix LLC in 1999 and moved to channel 48 later that year, improving over-the-air reception. They became a Class A television station a year later when that class of station was approved by the FCC. The locally produced newscast and the move to in-core channel 48 helped them to qualify for the new status, giving them primary station protection during the digital television conversion of full-service stations, and guaranteeing them an opportunity to upgrade to digital TV. In December 2002, Telemundo acquired KDRX-LP, and a few months later, changed its call letters to KDRX-CA to reflect its Class A status. However, Telemundo in Phoenix was up against one of the country's most dominant Univision outlets, full-powered KTVW. In 2005, Univision cornered 89% of the Spanish-language ratings in Phoenix, which was the last major market where it enjoyed such an advantage. In order to compete, NBC reasoned, the station needed to upgrade to a full-powered signal. Thus NBC filed an application with the FCC to move the license of full-power NBC Telemundo-owned KPHZ (now KTAZ) from Holbrook channel 11 to Phoenix channel 39. In exchange, Daystar-owned station KDTP would move from Phoenix channel 39 to Holbrook channel 11, and KDRX-CA would be transferred to Daystar in order to keep a Daystar Television Network outlet in Phoenix. It was an unusual request and complicated, involving not only a swap of licenses, but also non-commercial reservations in Phoenix and Holbrook, plus the two low-powered stations (KPHZ-LP - now KDTP-LP - would be added to the deal later), but in October 2005, the FCC agreed to the proposal, over the objection of Univision. In June 2006, the station's license was transferred to Community Television Educators, Inc., while the intellectual unit moved to KTAZ. Later that month, KDRX-CA's call letters changed to KDTP- CA, reflecting the station's new owner, Daystar. The station continued to air Telemundo programming pending completion of new facilities for KTAZ, but changed its programming to the Daystar Television Network in July 2006 when the construction was complete. On February 4, 2008, KDTP-CA converted its Class A license back to a standard low-power license, likely because a Class A license requires local programs and the schedule for channel 48 was entirely the national Daystar schedule. No longer able to use the \\"-CA\\" suffix, and with \\"KDTP-LP\\" already belonging to its sister station on channel 58, the station changed its call sign to K48LK and then to KDPH-LP on March 1. The station also has a construction permit to build a digital companion on UHF channel 46, which it has designated as KDTP-LD.

The British won, leading to a twenty-month occupation of Manila. Prelude The British Ministry approved Col. Draper's plans for an expedition to Havana and , under Capt. Cathcart Grant, was sent to intercept Manila bound vessels. The first portion of the invasion fleet sailed from India on 21 July, under Commodore Teddinson, followed by the remainder under Admiral Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet, and Col. Draper on 1 August. served as the admiral's flagship. On 1 August 1762, a British fleet of eight ships of the line, three frigates, and four store ships, sailed away from Madras with a force of 6,839 regulars, sailors and marines. The commander of the expedition was Brigadier-General William Draper. He was assisted by Colonel Monson as second in command, Major Scott as adjutant-general and Captain Fletcher as brigade-major of the East India Company. The expeditionary force consisted of the 79th Draper's Regiment of Foot, a company of Royal Artillery, 29 East India Company artillerymen, 610 sepoys, and 365 irregulars. Manila was garrisoned by the Life Guard of the Governor-General of the Philippines, the 2nd Battalion of the King's regiment under Don Miguel de Valdez, Spanish marines, a corps of artillery under Lt. Gen. Don Felix de Eguilux, seconded by Brig. the Marquis de Villa Medina, a company of Pampangos, and a company of cadets. Battle Admiral Cornish's fleet, fourteen vessels, of which ten carried more than fifty guns apiece, anchored in Manila Bay on 23 September. A landing was planned two miles south of the city, covered by , under Captain King, HMS Seahorse, under Captain Grant, and under Captain Pelghin. The three-pronged landing force of 274 marines was led by Colonel Draper, center, Major More, right, and Colonel Monson, left. The next day, they were joined by 632 seamen under Captains Collins, Pitchford and Ouvry. Fort Polverina was captured on 25 September. Further reconnaissance revealed that the fortifications of Manila were not formidable, in fact they were incomplete. \\"In many places the ditch had never been finished, the covered way was out of repair, the glacis was too low, some of the outworks were without cannon...\\" On 30 September, a British storeship arrived with entrenching tools, but was driven ashore by a gale. She had run aground so that she screened the rear of Draper's camp from a large force of Filipinos. Her stores were landed with greater speed and safety than would have been possible had she remained afloat for the gale continued for several days and forbade the passage of boats through the surf. A strong gale started on 1 October, cutting off communication with the British fleet. On the morning of 4 October, a force of 1,000 local Pampangos attacked a recently built cantonment but was beaten back with 300 casualties. After this failure, all except 1,800 of the Pamgangos abandoned the city. \\"The fire from the garrison now became faint, while that of the besiegers was stronger than ever, and ere long a breach became practicable.\\" On 6 October, 60 volunteers under Lieutenant Russell advanced through the breach in the Bastion of St. Andrew. Engineers and pioneers followed, then came Colonel Monson and Major More with two divisions of the 79th, the seamen and then another division of the 79th. Preventing further casualties on both sides (in accordance with his Catholic beliefs), acting Governor-General Archbishop Manuel Rojo del Rio y Vieyra surrendered both Manila and Cavite to Draper and Cornish. Map of the British Conquest of Manila in 1762 Aftermath The British occupation of Manila lasted until Manila was returned to Spain according to the 1763 Treaty of Paris. News that it had been lost did not reach Spain until after the cessation of hostilities between the two powers. Oidor Don Simon Anda y Salazar had been dispatched to Bulacan in order to organize resistance. There he organized an army of 10,000 Filipinos under the command of Jose Busto. Manila was placed under the authority of civilian Deputy Governor Dawsonne Drake, appointed by the East India Company as the leader of the Manila Council. Major Fell commanded the garrison as another member of the council During their time in the Philippines, the British found themselves confined to Manila and Cavite in a deteriorating situation, unable to extend British control over the islands and unable to make good their promised support for an uprising led first by Diego Silang and later by his wife Gabriela, which was crushed by Spanish forces. The British expedition was rewarded after the capture of the treasure ship Filipina, carrying American silver from Acapulco, and in a battle off Cavite on October 2, 1762 the Spanish ship Sant√≠sima Trinidad which carried goods from China bound for Spain. The capture of the ship made both men wealthy, and to such an extent that they were able to retire back home on the prize money alone. The city remained under British rule for 18 months and was returned to Spain in April 1764 after the 1763 Treaty of Paris. Draper and Cornish were thanked by Parliament on 19 April 1763; Cornish was made a Baronet of Great Britain, and Draper eventually received as Knighthood of the Bath.

It is a member of the family Percichthyidae and is closely related to the golden perch (Macquaria ambigua). The Macquarie perch derives its scientific name from the Macquarie River where the first scientifically described specimen was collected (Macquaria) and a derivation of the Latin word for \\"southern\\" (australasica). Description and diet Closeup of Macquarie perch head Macquarie perch are a medium-sized fish, commonly 30‚Äì40 cm and 1.0‚Äì1.5 kg. Maximum size is about 2.5 kg and 50 cm. Their body is elongated, deep, and laterally compressed. The caudal fin, anal fin and soft dorsal fin are rounded. Spiny dorsal fin medium height and strong. Mouth and eyes are relatively small. Colouration can vary from tan to (more commonly) dark purplish-grey to black. The irises of the eyes are distinctly silver. Macquarie perch are a relatively placid native fish species with the bulk of their diet consisting of aquatic invertebrates such as caddisfly, stonefly and mayfly species, with a small quantity of terrestrial insects taken as well. Breeding and biology The Macquarie perch is primarily an upland native fish and has a breeding biology clearly adapted to flowing upland rivers and streams. (For this reason, the species has proven difficult to breed artificially, as captive females do not produce ripe eggs when kept in still broodponds or tanks). Macquarie perch breed in late spring at temperatures of 15 to 16 ¬∞C, in flowing water over unsilted cobble and gravel substrate. The demersal (sinking) eggs fall into the interstices (spaces) between the gravel and cobble, where they lodge and are then protected and incubated until hatching. This is a breeding strategy similar to that used by introduced species of trout. Macquarie perch appear to have inherited the sexual dimorphism of other Macquaria species where females reach a larger maximum size than males. Females also reach sexual maturity at older, larger sizes than males. Limited ageing work on Macquarie perch has recorded fish to 20 years of age. Maximum age for Macquarie perch is probably similar to the maximum age recorded for the closely related golden perch (26 years). Range Macquarie perch were originally found in the larger upland rivers and streams in the south-eastern corner of the Murray-Darling system, which they usually co-inhabited with trout cod and one or both of the blackfish species. Macquarie perch continue a pattern found in native freshwater fish of the Murray-Darling system of specialisation into lowland and upland stream inhabitants. Macquarie perch are a speciated, more specialised upland version of the golden perch, which is primarily a lowland fish. (Having said this, the primarily lowland golden perch, being highly adaptable species, did extend into upland habitats) in some situations. Macquarie perch are found in the eastern coastal Shoalhaven and Hawkesbury- Nepean river systems as well as the Murray-Darling Basin, indicating that, as with some other native fish genera in south-eastern Australia, Macquarie perch have managed to cross the Great Dividing Range through natural river capture/connection events. Genetic research now indicates the Shoalhaven River population was the ancestral Macquarie perch population and colonised the Hawkesbury-Nepean system ~2 million years ago, and the Hawkesbury-Nepean population then colonised the Murray-Darling Basin ‚Äî possibly through a \\"wet divide\\" in the Breadalbane Plains region, ~657,000 years ago (Faulks et al., 2008). Major differences between the eastern coastal populations and the Murray-Darling population are that the eastern coastal populations display a far smaller average and maximum size (15 and 20 cm respectively) and are reported to have one less vertebra than the Murray-Darling species. Recent evidence suggest the Shoalhaven population is now extinct after a rapid decline due to damming of their habitat and subsequent encroachment of legally and illegally stocked fish species. The Hawkesbury-Nepean population appears to be threatened by introduced trout and other exotic fish, river damming and regulation, siltation, and urban encroachment, but does not appear to be as threatened as the Murray-Darling species. Information on this page relates primarily to the Murray-Darling population. There is also a translocated self- sustaining breeding population of Macquarie Perch located in the middle and upper reaches of the Yarra River on the outskirts of Melbourne. They highest numbers are found lowest reaches, which also support a mix of translocated native and introduced fish including trout. In this stretch however no fish species is particularly dominant, and introduced trout are not numerous. Conservation Murray-Darling Macquarie perch are now listed as endangered on state and Commonwealth listings. Gross overfishing by anglers, habitat degradation through siltation, and regulation of flow and \\"thermal pollution\\" by dams have all been major causes of decline. A mysterious but endemic disease called Epizootic Haemotopoeitic Necrosis virus (EHN virus), now vectored by introduced redfin perch, has been proven to be fatal to Macquarie perch, and may have contributed to the decline of some populations of Macquarie perch in upland impoundments. What has become clear however is that total domination of the Macquarie perch's upland habitats by introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have also been a major cause of decline. Indeed, Macquarie perch populations have failed in significant stretches of relatively pristine upland river that offer excellent habitat, are not silted, dammed or overfished, and where there are no possible explanations for their demise except introduced trout species. Dietary studies have documented significant overlap between the diet of Macquarie perch and introduced trout species, and anglers have observed predation of Macquarie perch juveniles by introduced trout species. Several publications in the 1940s through to the 1960s by the director of the Victorian Fisheries and Game Department (A.D.Butcher) documents predation on juvenile trout cod, Macquarie perch and other upland native fish species by introduced trout species, and major dietary overlaps. Recent research (Lintermans, 2006) records dietary overlaps that are significant by scientific criteria between Macquarie perch and introduced trout species. Over the last 20 or 30 years, the last few remaining Macquarie perch populations in upland habitats have faltered. All of these populations appear to be in extinction vortices and may disappear completely over the next several of decades. Macquarie perch have proved difficult but not impossible to breed. However, no Australian government agency is breeding Macquarie perch in significant numbers, and some government agencies are stocking upland habitats containing remnant Macquarie perch populations with introduced trout species. Not only do these stockings threaten Macquarie perch by competition and predation, but rainbow trout fingerlings have been shown to carry significant levels of EHN virus.

Minerva Pious (March 5, 1903 ‚Äì March 16, 1979) was an American radio, television and film actress. She was best known as the malaprop-prone Pansy Nussbaum in Fred Allen's famous \\"Allen's Alley\\" current-events skits. In his book, Treadmill to Oblivion, Allen called Pious \\"the most accomplished woman dialectitian ever to appear in radio.\\" Early years Minnie Pious, as she was originally known, was born in Odessa, Czarist Russia, and moved to the United States with her parents when she was 2 years old, becoming a U.S. citizen in 1918 through her naturalized citizen father. She attended high school in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where she was active in the Players Club dramatic organization. An article in the December 6, 1919, issue of the Bridgeport Telegram reported, \\"Miss Minerva Pious delighted the school with her dramatic reading ...\\" and added \\"Miss Pious has given very many successful story readings through the past year and will continue the community work.\\" Pious's excellent typing and shorthand in high school led to a job as a stenographer for a judge in Bridgeport. She later wrote for a national syndicate. Next she was a writer for Loew's. She spent the majority of her life and career in New York City and worked extensively as a radio comedian. Allen's Alley The Allen's Alley cast (l to r): Fred Allen, Kenny Delmar, Minerva Pious, Peter Donald, Parker Fennelly. Pious obtained her first regular job as part of Allen's Mighty Allen Art Players in the 1930s when Allen hosted the hour-long Town Hall Tonight. Playing a number of dialect roles in Allen's clever news spoofs and various other satires, Pious developed them into the Russian-Jewish housewife Mrs. Nussbaum by 1942, the year in which Allen's news spoofs finally developed into the \\"Allen's Alley\\" routines. In a review published in Billboard October 18, 1947, Jerry Franken praised her performance, writing, \\"Mrs. Nussbaum's malapropisms and occasionally inspired twists, sharpened by Minerva Pious's sock performance, are still boff.\\" Pious became a fixture in the routines until Allen's show ended in 1949. Invariably, she greeted Allen's knock on her door with her Yiddish \\"Nuuuuuu,\\" then answered Allen's cheery \\"Mrs. Nussbaum!\\" with lines like: :\\"You are expectink maybe Veinstein Chuychill?\\" :\\"You are expecting maybe Cecil B. Schlemeil?\\" :\\"You are expecting maybe Tulalulalula Bankhead?\\" :\\"You are expecting maybe Dinah Schnorra?\\" :\\"You are expecting maybe Hoagy Carbunkle?\\" Pious's portions of the \\"Alley\\" segments usually involved one or another joke at the expense of Mrs. Nussbaum's never-heard husband, Pierre. In one episode, Pierre had a bad cold, and one of the remedies involved vegetables of all types. According to Mrs. Nussbaum, the vegetables included \\"Carrots, stringle-a-beans and rutta-bagels.\\" Her distinctive accented voice and Jane Ace-like knack for malaprops made her a series trademark. Other radio Pious was often invited to play Nussbaum on other radio programs, such as The Jack Benny Program (inviting him to her new restaurant: \\"We feature soft lights and hard salami\\") and Duffy's Tavern. She was cast in the radio plays of Norman Corwin (especially playing a Brooklynese crime solver in Murder in Studio One) and on the Columbia Workshop. In addition to comedy routines on Kate Smith's series, she was heard on shows hosted by Ed Wynn and Bob Hope, along with roles on The Goldbergs and the soap opera Life Can Be Beautiful. She also was heard on The Alan Young Show.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc. .

She was very concerned about television; she never worked very much. But radio was fine.\\"The Laugh Crafters Television The hip condition didn't stop Pious from making occasional television appearances, on shows such as The Colgate Comedy Hour and The Chevrolet Television Theatre. She appeared briefly in the television soap The Edge of Night in 1956, playing a landlady. Films Her few film credits included playing Mrs. Nussbaum on camera in Allen's It's in the Bag! and a featured voice role in Pinocchio in Outer Space.

It is a resident breeder from southern Mexico and Trinidad south to Bolivia and Argentina. At least some birds from Central America and Trinidad are migratory, and this species also visits Tobago. This tyrant flycatcher is found in savannah and other semi-open habitat with large trees. It gets its name because it does not build its own nest, but appropriates the domed or enclosed nests of other, often far larger, bird species, such as yellow-rumped cacique or crested oropendola. Once the persistence of the flycatchers has driven the rightful owners away, their eggs are removed, and the female flycatcher lays up to four, but usually two, black-streaked brown eggs.

The strip debuted on February 10, 2003. Past artists for the strip include John Horsley from y2cl, who dropped out before the strip launched, Trevor Adams, who was on board for about six months, then Chad W. M. Porter, who drew the strip for two years. Least I Could Do is produced by Blind Ferret Entertainment, which owns the rights to the strip. The primary theme of the strip is sexuality, especially the promiscuity of the primary character, Rayne Summers, who is loosely based upon Sohmer himself. The strip updates every day. Sunday features Least I Could Do: Beginnings, a strip following Rayne at age 8 with storylines unrelated to the main strip. Story lines tend to last for only a few strips, but some have gone several weeks. History The original artist for the strip was Trevor Adams, who drew the strip from its debut until July 18, 2003, later moving on to create his own comic Gemini Paradox. Chad Porter took over on July 28, 2003. In late 2004, I Have My Moments, a full-color book featuring the first year of LICD with Porter as the artist, was published. In early 2005, the strip underwent a major change with the introduction of a new character, Noel, Rayne's friend. Noel was often given roles that previously would have gone to the character John Gold, whose frequency in the strip had been reduced. Rayne soon became a business executive on falsified credentials, with the intent of sleeping with the CEO of IDS Enterprises, Marcy McKean. Least I Could Do \\"3.0\\" launched on August 15, 2005 with the departure of Porter as the artist. Lar deSouza, a long time friend of Sohmer and his artistic partner on the daily comic In Other News, took over as the artist. The comic and website have been undergoing some major changes as a result. December 2005 marked the publication of My Will Be Done, the complete 2nd-year collection featuring Chad Porter's final strips for the comic. It also included a mini-comic drawn by Lar, depicting the origins of \\"Bra-Man\\". In July 2006 the first Bra-Man comic was released. In November 2006, Because I Can, the 3rd year collection, and the first to feature current artist Lar deSouza was published. In the July 9, 2007 strip, the cast opened a \\"letter\\" from the writer and artist which stated that from that moment on, they would age normally rather than remain a perpetual age 24 or so. Since then, the strip's characters have enacted major life changes: notably, Noel moved in with and later married his girlfriend, and Rayne, in a plot arc beginning in September, experimented with monogamy. In 2010, Sohmer announced that deSouza will be re-drawing the original strips done by Trevor Adams in the current artistic style. Main characters Though the primary character is Rayne, there are a large number of supporting characters, and the strip will sometimes go for up to a week without a strip featuring Rayne. These usually involve large story arcs involving the other characters, though Least I Could Do still specializes in the one strip joke. =Rayne= Rayne Summers is the protagonist of \\"Least I Could Do\\". He is a shallow, childlike, and sexually driven 24-year-old (now ) with an underdeveloped emotional intelligence as well as a severe superiority complex. Rayne shares a joyful sibling rivalry with his older brother Eric Summers, who is a surgeon. In the 2006 storyline, Rayne and Eric found out they had a sister they never knew about, and a niece named Ashley. Rayne eventually takes a liking to his niece, despite a rocky start, and eventually comes to care for her as a surrogate father, with Ashley considering him her favourite Unca. As the comic progressed, Rayne's character developed and has been dealing with increased maturity and vulnerability. It was revealed that much of Rayne's promiscuity and childishness came as a reaction to severe depression caused by his inability to settle down and his fear of change. His promiscuity has become less and less of a theme as the strip has progressed, and as of March 8, 2014, he is in an exclusive relationship with the character Jumpmaster Julie who first appeared on August 23, 2006. =Noel= Noel is Rayne's best friend, a later addition to the strip, first appearing on January 5, 2005. Noel's first appearances lined up with a period in which the Rayne character needed a comedic foil. Noel is the calm, sardonic yin to Rayne's yang, and although he is more than willing to participate in Rayne's insane schemes, he has learned to sit back and watch the carnage rather than get too involved. Although introduced as Rayne's wingman, Noel soon found himself in a serious relationship with Kate, a woman he met at a speed dating event. Over the course of the comic, they married and had three children: A boy, Logan (named after the X-Man) and twins Lucas and Leia =Issa= Melissa \\"Issa\\" Allie is one of Rayne's few platonic female friends. An extremely gorgeous redhead with a voluptuous figure and natural yellow eyes, Issa is the object of Rayne's frequent sexual advances which she continually rejects. Despite this, it sometimes seems as though she has a slight subconscious crush on him. When she introduced her friends to her farmer-boyfriend, Huck, the crew noted his resemblance to Rayne. Despite her attractiveness and continual disgust at some of their antics, Issa still manages to play the voice of reason and fits in with Rayne and the rest of the boys. She is not above manipulating her male friends, such as offering to try on underwear at Victoria's Secret for Rayne, in exchange for him accompanying her to the mall. Issa has known Rayne since at least his teenage years, offering him advice after the relationship that started his womanizing streak, showing her to be one of Rayne's oldest friends. Issa holds the record for holding out against Rayne's advances. Rayne got her a job at IDS as a replacement for a staff member on maternity leave, although it remains to be seen if this is a permanent post. She and Michael Von Huntington, an IDS employee, are married and have a daughter. =Mick= Mick Alfa is an overweight and socially awkward friend of Rayne's, who is often used as a wingman. Rayne often enlists Mick in elaborate (and occasionally bizarre) charades to help him get laid. Mick is a TV program director, and has had a greater number of steady relationships than Rayne, Noel and John combined. Mick has been dating Tamara, a young college co-ed, for two years. Mick also has a passion for potato chips. Recently, it has been revealed that Mick's father was murdered by his mother's lover, after which his mother went to prison and became a lesbian. In July 2011 it was revealed that Mick will be marrying Tamara (Tammy) after a six-year relationship.http://leasticoulddo.com/comic/20110711 =John= John Gold is Rayne's childhood friend and roommate, who often acts as his foil. He continually expresses a resigned discontent with Rayne's promiscuity. John is looking for a wife, which has been shown to lead him into being somewhat needy and over-hasty in relationships. He is a grade school teacher. One relationship of John's was with a woman named Hannah, who became a major part of his life and even moved in with him, but eventually left him due to Rayne's antics. John's temptations are represented by a small Darth Vader, a parody of the shoulder devil clich√©. The Darth Vader character frequently appears, not only to tempt him, but also to voice the darker thoughts that John represses. As of 2015, he moved from Rayne's apartment to a new house to start a family with his girlfriend Laura, whom he met in 2013. Books As of 2009, there were six Least I Could Do collections published, which include the two years that the comic was drawn by Chad and the three years of deSouza's work. The second book includes a mini-comic drawn by Lar that explains the origins of Bra-Man. They have also printed the first edition of Bra-Man, a spin-off comic based on Rayne's drunken alter-ego and a book of Least I Could Do: Beginnings which tells stories about Rayne's childhood along with his friends and family. =Complete Year Collections= # I Have My Moments: The Complete First Year Collection; December 2004 # My Will Be Done: The Complete Second Year Collection; December 2005 # Because I Can: The Complete Third Year Collection; December 2006 # I Love This Guy: The Complete Fourth Year Collection'; October 2007 # Yield To Me: The Complete Fifth Year Collection; September 2008 # I Am Not A Credible Source: The Complete Sixth Year Collection; November 2009 # I Can't Help You Here: The Complete Seventh Year Collection; # I Must Do This: The Complete Eighth Year Collection; # \\"I Play To Win: The Complete Ninth Year Collection\\"; # \\"The Answer May Surprise You: The Complete Tenth Year Collection; # \\"The Planet's Fine: The Complete Eleventh Year Collection\\"; # \\"I Just Solved Everything: The Complete Twelfth Year Collection\\"; =Collections= # Jesus Made Me Do It: Least I Could Do, Volume 1; November 2008 # Velcro Pants Are Awesome: Least I Could Do, Volume 2; June 2009 # My Eyes Are Up Here: Least I Could Do, Volume 3; February 2010 # I Wish You Were Chewbacca: Least I Could Do, Volume 4; April 2011 =Beginnings= # Look At Me: A Month's Worth of Sundays of Least I Could Do Beginnings; June 2009 # Adorableness: Least I Could Do Beginnings, Volume 2; January 2010 # Fire In The Hole: Least I Could Do Beginnings, Volume 3 # Don't Make This Weird: Least I Could Do Beginnings, Volume 4 # I'll Field This One: Least I Could Do Beginnings, Volume 5 ; August 2012 =Others= # Bra-Man #1; July 2006 # Least I Could Do: Noir et Blanc Recurring features and related projects =Valentine's Day Contest= Since February 2004, Least I Could Do has had a yearly event in which fans can submit themselves to be 'dates' for one of the strip's characters, either primary or secondary. The selection process is shown in the comic, with the cast sorting through letters and often with Rayne attempting to be the selected date. Upon the decision, the fan is drawn into the strip, sharing a date with the cast member of their choice. If supporting cast members are selected, the date storyline often involves Rayne attempting to sabotage things, primarily out of jealousy for not being selected. The Valentine's storyline runs for roughly a week's time. In recent years, three of the five primary characters (Issa, Noel & Mick) are now officially in committed relationships, which calls into question whether or not the contest will be run differently and if said characters can still be selected by fans. =Looking For Group= Starting in 2006, Sohmer and DeSouza began a comic- fantasy webcomic called Looking For Group. Characters from Looking for Group have appeared in the background of a May 7, 2008 Least I could Do strip. Richard the Warlock and his rabbit also appeared during the CRISIS Arc on April 6, 2009 and incinerated a future version of Rayne. Krunch Bloodrage also appeared in the same arc, fighting Rayne's Audibot in the background of the April 10, 2009 strip. =Bra-Man= In July 2006, the first \\"Bra-Man\\" comic was released. The 24-page comic showcases the adventures of Bra-Man, Rayne Summers' alter-ego. Bra-Man No. 1 was written by Ryan Sohmer, drawn by Lar deSouza, and coloured by Marc Brunet. = Least I Could Do: Beginnings = On November 9, 2008, Sohmer and DeSouza announced that a new strip would appear on Sundays, thus having a strip every day of the week. Sohmer said, \\"For quite some time now, Lar and I have been toying with the idea of going to a 7-day a week schedule with LICD. While other creators seem to be cutting back on their output lately, we wanted to do more.\\" But, not wanting to do just another normal strip, Sohmer and DeSouza decided to start up \\"Beginnings,\\" a Sunday- only strip on the website with storylines separate from the rest of the comic based around Rayne's childhood, specifically at 8 years old. Beginnings is similar in both format and artistic style to Calvin & Hobbes, which has been occasionally referenced in LICD, including Calvin's sled (with a stuffed tiger clearly visible) running over Noel and Rayne offering Calvin money to run him over again. =Animated series= Blind Ferret Entertainment and Teletoon had a development deal for an animated version of Least I Could Do; however, Blind Ferret opted out of the deal because it believed they would have to surrender too much creative control. Following the collapse of that deal, Sohmer entered into negotiations with an American network for a potential development deal. In response to the failed Teletoon deal, Sohmer subsequently created a Kickstarter project, asking fans for donations to produce a television pilot consistent with the original vision for an animated series. The project garnered over $100,000 in pledges in 2011.

Haeberle (born circa 1940) is a former United States Army photographer best known for the photographs he took of the My Lai Massacre on March 16, 1968. The monochrome photographs he took were made using an Army camera and were either subject to censorship or did not depict any South Vietnamese casualties when published in an Army newspaper. On the other hand, Haeberle took color photographs with his own camera while on duty the same day, which he kept and later sold to the media. The then-Sgt. Haeberle, having returned to his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio after an honorable discharge, offered them to The Plain Dealer; the newspaper published some of them on November 20, 1969. Haeberle soon after sold the photos to Life magazine, which were published in the December 5, 1969 issue.Massacre at My Lai. Life, December 5th, 1969: 39. One of the photos in particular became iconic of the massacre, in large part because of its use in the And babies poster, which was distributed around the world used in protest marches where it was televised and reproduced in newspapers. Lieutenant General Peers' contrary statement to the press in 1970 notwithstanding, in 2009, Haeberle admitted that he destroyed a number of photographs he took during the My Lai Massacre. Unlike the photographs of the dead bodies, the destroyed photographs depicted Americans in the process of murdering South Vietnamese civilians. One of Haeberle's My Lai photos: \\"Most were women and babies. It looked as if they tried to get away\\" Haeberle photographing a body thrown into a well. Background According to Camilla Griggers, professor of Visual Communication and Linguistics at California State University:Camilla Benolirao Griggers, \\"War and the Politics of Perception,\\" chapter 1 from the essay \\"Visualizing War\\" > The Army photographer, Ronald Haeberle, assigned to Charlie Company on March > 16, 1968 had two cameras. One was an Army standard; one was his personal > camera. The film on the Army-owned camera, i.e., the official camera of the > State, showed standard operations ¬≠ that is \\"authorized\\" and \\"official\\" > operations including interrogating villagers and burning \\"insurgent\\" huts. > What the film on the personal camera showed, however, was different. When > turned over to the press and Government by the photographer, those > \\"unofficial\\" photographs provided the grounds for a court martial. > Haeberle's personal images (owned by himself and not the US Government) > showed hundreds of villagers who had been killed by U.S. troops. More > significantly, they showed that the dead were primarily women and children, > including infants. As is evident from comments made in a 1969 telephone conversation between United States National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, revealed recently by the National Security Archive, the photos of the war crime were too shocking for senior officials to stage an effective cover-up. Secretary of Defense Laird is heard to say, \\"There are so many kids just lying there; these pictures are authentic.\\" Haeberle later testified that he personally saw about 30 different U.S. soldiers kill about 100 civilians. According to the investigation, Haeberle previously \\"withheld and suppressed from proper authorities the photographic evidence of atrocities he had obtained\\" despite \\"having a particular duty to report any knowledge of suspected or apparent war crimes\\". However Haeberle had claimed in his testimony that he did not turn in his photographic film of the atrocities to the brigade information office, because \\"if you take a photograph of a general smiling wrong in the photograph, you destroyed that photograph\\", therefore Haeberle felt his photographs would have been destroyed if he had turned them in as was standard practice. Aftermath During the summer of 2012, Ron Haeberle visited Vietnam and My Lai hamlet, where he met with Tran Van Duc, a survivor of the My Lai massacre.King, Tim.

It was first described by Marie- Guillaume-Alphonse Devergie in 1856, and the condition is also known as Devergie's disease. and the eponymous named Diagnosis =Classification= Dr. W.A.D. Griffiths, from Great Britain, classified six forms of PRP in the early 1980s. \\\\- describes the various forms At this time, the causes of PRP are still unknown and symptoms can be difficult to diagnose. Frequently, more than one medical professional will be consulted before an accurate PRP diagnosis is made. Dermatologists have identified both an acquired form and an inherited form (familial) of PRP and have described them in medical journals. The acquired form usually shows a spontaneous or gradual remission of symptoms within several years although long-term symptoms may continue for years. The inherited form starts early in childhood with persistent long-term symptoms into adulthood. Although most people who develop PRP are over age 50, individuals of any age, race, and nationality can be affected. Women and men seem to be equally affected. Treatment Treatment with emollients is used to relieve symptoms of cracking and dryness. Application of lubricants under plastic occlusion before bedtime appears to aid removal of scales on hands and feet. Other topical options include: topical corticosteroids alone, or combined with keratolytics, such as urea and vitamin D3 analogues. The most effective therapy is long term use of oral retinoids, such as acitretin and isotretinoin. Other effective systemic approaches include: methotrexate, cyclosporin and corticosteroids. There are also reports that the monoclonal Ab ustekinumab (blocks IL-23/ IL-12) may be effective.

He began his career with radio shows in New York City and Chicago before being enticed to come to then- radio station WCPO in Cincinnati as a news reporter and announcer around 1945. He was chosen best newscaster in Cincinnati in 1947 after conducting an interview with men trapped in a collapsed downtown building. Eventually abandoning radio news in favor of entertainment, he spent his first few years in television as host of Paul Dixon's Song Shop, a three-hour daily show he co-hosted with Dottie Mack and Wanda Lewis pantomiming to records of the day. By 1954 his show was so popular that Dumont Television enticed Dixon to come to New York to do the show nationally. After a year a homesick Dixon returned to Cincinnati, and hired on at WLWT to host a new daytime TV show geared to housewives.Friedman, Jim (2007), Images Of America: Cincinnati Television, page 34, Arcadia Publishing, Television The Paul Dixon Show, after having aired on the DuMont network from September 29, 1952 to April 8, 1955, premiered on Cincinnati's WLWT in 1955. The show began as a half-hour program, but later expanded to 90 minutes with co-hosts Bonnie Lou and Colleen Sharp. Avco Broadcasting Corporation, who owned WLWT, syndicated Dixon's show in other markets where they owned TV stations, including Columbus and Dayton, Ohio and Indianapolis, Indiana. \\"Paul Baby\\", as he came to be known (the nickname was given him by a prop boy) had a breezy style and a sense of humor that appealed to housewives and others alike. His show reached its peak on Tuesday, March 11, 1969, when he staged a wedding for two rubber chickens, that had become longtime props on the show (they were mainly used for in-house commercials for Kroger). Fellow Cincinnati TV personality Bob Braun appeared as Best Man, with Colleen Sharp and Bonnie Lou as Matrons of Honor. To this day the chicken wedding remains a significant piece of WLWT's (and Cincinnati's) television history. Former late night TV host David Letterman, who grew up in Indianapolis, cited Dixon's comedic talent as inspiration for his own antics. Author Dixon wrote and published two books: *Paul Baby: Confessions of the Mayor of Kneesville (1968) *Letters to Paul Baby (1970), a compilation of Dixon's favorite fan mail. Personal life Dixon and his wife Marge had two children; Pamela and Greg. Dixon suffered his first heart attack in 1970, shortly after his son Greg was killed in a car accident. On the heels of his son's death, a grieving Dixon had to be helped on stage to do his show one day. Complications later led to a ruptured aneurysm, which claimed Dixon's life on December 28, 1974. Avco executives concluded that Dixon could not be replaced, so following a month of reruns, The Paul Dixon Show quietly ended its near-20 year run by the end of January 1975. Dixon is buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery. References External links *TVParty.com: Paul Dixon and other Cincinnati favorites *WLWT.com page featuring classic clips from the Paul Dixon show.

No matter what the language of the song, even if it is Bengali, I write it in Hindi. I have certain notations and markings to indicate the way it should be pronounced.

The dance style originated in the 1950s or 1960s at Jamaican dance halls, where ska music was played.Romer, Megan, Ska Music 101, about.com Ska music has a prominent backbeat played by the electric guitar on beats two and four of a 4/4 bar of music. When ska became popular amongst British mods and skinheads of the 1960s, these UK youth adopted these types of dances and altered them. The dancing style was revived during the 1970s and 1980s 2 Tone era, and has been adopted by some individuals in the hardcore punk subculture. Types Originally, skanking consisted of a ‚Äúrunning man‚Äù motion of the legs to the beat while alternating bent-elbow fist-punches, left and right. Over time, variations emerged. The punk version features a sharp striking out look with the arms, and is sometimes used in moshing to knock around others doing the same. However, this is rarely seen as an act of true aggression but rather a consensual release of emotion. This rough appearance tends to lead to negative stereotypes of violence, though they are rare at best and almost never tolerated by venue operators, bands, or other audience members. While the flailing, swinging, and pushing may appear dangerous, there is almost always a conscious effort by each dancer in the 'pit' to refrain from actually striking or hurting each other. Additionally, should any one person trip and fall, others in the group tend to avoid trampling them, or even help them to get back up. The style, speed, and moves used when skanking are as diverse as the music it is performed to, usually dictated by its rhythm and genre. For example, the skanking done at a reggae concert would typically be slower and more restrained than the skanking done at a hardcore punk show. An example of this is the lighter style known as 'stroll' which has become popularized by American ska-punk bands, mainly Big D and the Kids Table. In this style, dancers tend to 'stroll' in a circle around the center 'pit' while rhythmically swaying from side to side with arms bent and marching in sync to the music.

The organization was formed in March 2002 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Universal Studios, The Walt Disney Company and Warner Bros. The primary purpose of DCI is to establish and document specifications for an open architecture for digital cinema that ensures a uniform and high level of technical performance, reliability and quality. By establishing a common set of content requirements, distributors, studios, exhibitors, d-cinema manufacturers and vendors can be assured of interoperability and compatibility. Because of the relationship of DCI to many of Hollywood's key studios, conformance to DCI's specifications is considered a requirement by software developers or equipment manufacturers targeting the digital cinema market. Specification On July 20, 2005, DCI released Version 1.0 of its \\"Digital Cinema System Specification\\", commonly referred to as the \\"DCI Specification\\". The document describes overall system requirements and specifications for digital cinema. Between March 28, 2006, and March 21, 2007, DCI issued 148 errata to Version 1.0. DCI released Version 1.1 of the DCI Specification on April 12, 2007, incorporating the previous 148 errata into the DCI Specification. On April 15, 2007, at the annual NAB Digital Cinema Summit, DCI announced the new version, as well as some future plans. They released a \\"Stereoscopic Digital Cinema Addendum\\". to begin to establish 3-D technical specifications in response to the popularity of 3-D stereoscopic films. It was also announced \\"which studios would take over the leadership roles in DCI after the current leadership term expires at the end of September.\\" Subsequently, between August 27, 2007, and February 1, 2008, DCI issued 100 errata to Version 1.1. So, DCI released Version 1.2 of the DCI Specification on March 7, 2008, again incorporating the previous 100 errata into the specification document. An additional 96 errata were issued by August 30, 2012, so a revised Version 1.2 incorporating those additional errata was approved on October 10, 2012. DCI approved DCI Specification Version 1.3 on June 27, 2018, integrating the 45 errata issued to the previous version into a new document. On July 20, 2020, fifteen years to the day after Version 1.0, DCI issued a new DCI Specification Version 1.4 that assimilates 29 errata issued since Version 1.3. The previous versions are also archived on the DCI web site. Based on many SMPTE and ISO standards, such as JPEG 2000-compressed image and \\"broadcast wave\\" PCM/WAV sound, it explains the route to create an entire Digital Cinema Package (DCP) from a raw collection of files known as the Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM), as well as the specifics of its content protection, encryption, and forensic marking. The specification also establishes standards for the decoder requirements and the presentation environment itself, such as ambient light levels, pixel aspect and shape, image luminance, white point chromaticity, and those tolerances to be kept. Even though it specifies what kind of information is required, the DCI Specification does not include specific information about how data within a distribution package is to be formatted.

Related information The idea for DCI was originally mooted in late 1999 by Tom McGrath, then COO of Paramount Pictures, who applied to the U.S. Department of Justice for anti-trust waivers to allow the joint cooperation of all seven major motion picture studios. Universal Pictures made one of the first feature-length DCPs created to DCI specifications, using their film Serenity. Although it was not distributed theatrically, it had one public screening on November 7, 2005, at the USC Entertainment Technology Center's Digital Cinema Laboratory in the Pacific Theatre, Hollywood. Inside Man was Universal's first DCP commercial release, and, in addition to 35mm film distribution, was delivered via hard drive to 20 theatres in the United States along with two trailers. The Academy Film Archive houses the Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection, which includes film and digital elements from DCI's Standard Evaluation Material (StEM), a 12-minute production shot on 35mm and 65mm film, created for vendors and standards organizations to test and evaluate image compression and digital projection technologies.

This species can reach a standard length of , though most are only about . Paradise gouramis were one of the first ornamental fish available to western aquarium keepers, having been imported 1869 to France by the French aquarium fish importer Pierre Carbonnier in Paris. The paradise fish is one of the more aggressive members of its family. It is more aggressive than the three spot gourami, yet less pugnacious in nature than the less commonly kept combtail. Behaviour Albino paradise fish Paradise fish are fairly combative, harassing and attacking each other, as well as potentially killing small fish. During a fight, the paradise fish will often change its color, usually displaying dark blue lateral lines on the sides of their bodies; extend its fins; and spread out its operculum.Bischof, Claudia. \\"Diversity In Agonistic Behavior Of Croaking Gouramis (Trichopsis Vittata, T. Schalleri, And T. Pumila; Anabantoidei) And The Paradise Fish (Macropodus Opercularis; Anabantoidei).\\" Aggressive Behavior 22.6 (1996): 447‚Äì455. Academic Search Complete. Web. 19 Feb. 2015. Paradise fish are more likely to show aggressive behavior towards other paradise fish than to fish of a different species. Acts of aggression tend to increase as the distance to the fish's home increases.Gerlai, Robert, and Jerry A. Hogan. \\"Learning To Find The Opponent: An Ethological Analysis Of The Behavior Of Paradise Fish (Macropodus Opercularis) In Intra- And Interspecific Encounters.\\" Journal of Comparative Psychology 106.3 (1992): 306‚Äì315. PsycARTICLES. Web. 19 Feb. 2015. In the wild, they are predators, eating insects, invertebrates, and fish fry. The popularity of this species has waned in recent decades as much more colorful (and often less pugnacious) species of gouramis have become widely available to hobbyists. This species is one of the few fish that can change its color (lighter or darker) in response to stimuli. It also appears that paradise fish are capable of learning through a type of restrictive process. Most forms of active teaching seem to hinder the paradise fish's ability to learn.Warren, J. M. \\"Reversal Learning By Paradise Fish (Macropodus Opercularis).\\" Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology 53.4 (1960): 376‚Äì378. PsycARTICLES. Web. 20 Feb. 2015. Habitat and diet Paradise fish are tolerant of a wide range of water conditions, surviving in cool and warm waters alike. In the wild, they are most commonly found in shallow water containing dense vegetation, such as a marsh or rice field.Miklosi, Adam, Vilmos Csanyi, and Robert Gerlai. \\"Antipredator Behavior In Paradise Fish (Macropodus Opercularis ) Larvae: The Role Of Genetic Factors And Paternal Influence.\\" Behavior Genetics 27.3 (1997): 191‚Äì200. Academic Search Complete. Web. 19 Feb. 2015. However they can be kept in outdoor ponds, or even the simplest of unheated aquaria. They will accept virtually any food, but should be given a reasonably high-protein diet (as opposed to vegetable-based foods.) They also eat mosquito larvae, black worms, brine shrimp, and small flies. Disease control In Taiwan, the native populations of paradise fish have been reduced to low levels by pollution in the rivers, and are now listed as a threatened species. The local population of yellow fever mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti) has since increased in the absence of one of its main predators. The infection rate for dengue fever has subsequently increased in the human population, caused in part by to the lack of natural mosquito predators. Paradise fish are also considered to be an ideal subject for behavioral genetic studies and have been used to study Iridoviridae type viruses.Xu, Liwen, Juan Feng, and Youhua Huang. \\"Identification Of Lymphocystis Disease Virus From Paradise Fish Macropodus Opercularis (LCDV-PF).\\" Archives Of Virology 159.9 (2014): 2445‚Äì2449. MEDLINE. Web. 19 Feb. 2015. In home aquaria Macropodus opercularis (‚ôÇ) in a home aquarium Male paradise fish should be kept apart, since they will fight aggressively by locking jaws. A male can be kept with females; females may also be kept together in groups. A tank that includes paradise fish should be at least 20 gallons in size for a single male or 20‚Äì30 gallons for a community tank. The tank should be well planted and covered; bogwood and rockwork may be included. Paradise fish tankmates must be chosen with care. Suitable ones include giant danios, large tetras, most smaller catfishes, and even some of the less aggressive cichlids, such as firemouth cichlids. Slow-moving or long-finned fish such as fancy goldfish and freshwater angelfish are likely to be attacked by males; bettas and gouramis may also be victimized due to their resemblance to paradise fish. Male paradise fish may also attempt to court female bettas and gouramis. Fish less than 3 cm are likely to be consumed. If kept with significantly larger but non-aggressive fish, such as Geophagus cichlids, large Synodontis catfishes, or larger gouramis, they are usually submissive and do not act nearly as aggressively as when they are the dominant species in the aquarium. However, they themselves can be bullied by similar sized or even smaller fish if that fish has already established territory in the tank which it is not willing to share or give up. If this is the case they will not even attempt to fight and will take to hiding behind filters, plants, or in d√©cor, and will succumb to stress. Reproduction Sexing is easy, as males are more colorful and have longer fins compared to the females. As is typical of most bettas and gouramis, spawning involves a male building a bubble nest (a floating mat of saliva-coated air bubbles, often incorporating plant matter) and attracting a female to it. If the female accepts the male's advances, the fish will 'embrace' in open water, releasing both eggs and sperm into the water. The male gathers the fertilized eggs after each embrace, spitting them up into the bubble nest. After spawning, the male may violently attack his mate or any other fish that might approach the new fertilized eggs or hatched fry, which are both a common source of food in the natural habitat. A breeder usually chooses to move the female to a separate tank to improve the chances of survival of both the female and the hatched fry. After the fry have begun to swim freely, the male's protective behavior subsides, so the breeder removes the male for the protection of the fry, and they are raised on infusoria or newly hatched brine shrimp. An albino form of Macropodus opercularis is available. Many aquarists consider this form to be less aggressive than the wild type, but also less hardy, having more trouble with low temperatures.

He played domestic first-class cricket for Canterbury and Otago. Three of his five sons, Sir Richard, Dayle and Barry played cricket for New Zealand. The Chappell‚ÄìHadlee Trophy, which is competed for by Test teams from New Zealand and Australia is named in honour of the Hadlee family and the Australian Chappell family. Hadlee captained one of New Zealand's most highly regarded teams, the 1949 side which toured England in an era when New Zealand had yet to win a Test. As an administrator, he guided New Zealand cricket in the mid-1970s during years of increasing professionalism, the Kerry Packer threat and the sporting boycott of South Africa. He was awarded the Bert Sutcliffe Medal in 2001.http://nzcricketmuseum.co.nz/new- zealand-cricket-awards/ Early life Hadlee was born in Lincoln, Canterbury. His father was a blacksmith with 9 siblings, whose parents arrived in Dunedin in 1869. The young Hadlee fell in love with cricket when he was about 10. He read cricket history avidly, kept scorebooks of all the big games at Lancaster Park, and practised assiduously. Though he initially appeared awkward, at Christchurch Boys' High School, he also played hockey and rugby, and developed into a punishing batsman, particularly strong on the drive. He finished his school career by captaining the first eleven. He trained as a chartered accountant. First-class career In his first season for Canterbury (1933‚Äì34) Hadlee averaged over 50, and 94 in his second; he eventually scored 10 centuries for the province. Hadlee played 44 matches for Canterbury before retiring in 1951‚Äì52, having scored 3,183 runs at an average of 43.60. His highest score was 194 not out. After playing against touring MCC teams, Hadlee made his Test debut for New Zealand against England at Lord's in 1937, only 11 years after New Zealand joined the Imperial Cricket Conference, and 7 years after it played in its first Test match. Tall and elegant, he was known as an upright and attacking opening batsman. He missed the opportunity to play during the Second World War. His short sight prevented him from joining the Armed Forces. He scored 198 for Otago against the touring Australian team in 1945‚Äì46, and was appointed captain of New Zealand for the first Test in peacetime, against Australia that year. On a rain-affected pitch in Wellington, New Zealand were bowled out for 42 and 54, losing by an innings, and did not play Australia again in Tests until 1973‚Äì74. Although he made 1,225 runs in 1937, including an innings of 93 in the Test at Old Trafford which ended after he trod on his stumps, it was his captaincy of the 1949 New Zealand team to England that proved to be the pinnacle of his playing career. The 1949 team is still cited as one of the finest New Zealand has sent abroad and there were some illustrious names in the side, including Bert Sutcliffe, Martin Donnelly, John Reid, Jack Cowie, Tom Burtt, Harry Cave, Merv Wallace, Verdun Scott, Geoff Rabone and Frank Mooney. During the tour, he scored 1,439 runs, averaging 36 an innings, with two centuries. Out of 35 matches, his team lost just one, to Oxford University, on a rain-damaged pitch, and drew the four-Test series 0‚Äì0. As leading English writer John Woodcock noted: \\"Hadlee was a courageous and enterprising batsman, a popular and successful captain who played his cricket in the sporting manner usually associated with his country\\". John Arlott called him a \\"strategic commander of real ability\\". In all, Hadlee played 19 innings in 11 Tests, scoring 543 runs at an average of 30.16. He was never dismissed in Tests in single figures. His last Test was against England in Wellington in 1950‚Äì51. His only Test century, 116, was scored against England at Christchurch in 1946‚Äì47 as an opening batsman. He retired from first-class cricket in 1952. He continued playing senior club cricket in Christchurch for another 15 years, eventually scoring a record 15,391 club runs. In his first-class career, he scored 7523 runs from 117 matches, averaging 40.44 and notching up 18 centuries. Cricket administration Hadlee was a national selector, a New Zealand team manager, and a member of the management committee and Board of Control of New Zealand cricket from 1950‚Äì83. He was chairman from 1973‚Äì78 and president from 1981‚Äì83. He was a member of the \\"No Maoris, No Tour\\" protest movement, protesting against the All Blacks tour to South Africa in 1960. He was later blacklisted by the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC) for writing an article in the 1982 Wisden which called for South Africa be permitted to play international cricket. In the 1950 King's Birthday Honours, Hadlee was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services in the field of sport, and he was promoted to Commander of the same order, for services to cricket, in the 1978 Queen's Birthday Honours. Private life Hadlee married Lilla Monro in 1940. They had met on the ship to England in 1937. They had five sons. He took great pride in the fact that three of his five sons represented New Zealand: Dayle, a Test fast bowler, and Barry, a batsman in the inaugural 1975 Cricket World Cup, were eclipsed by Richard, who became a leading all rounder: he took 431 Test wickets ‚Äì a world record at the time ‚Äì and 1,490 first class wickets, and also finished with a Test batting average of 27.16. Richard was knighted for services to cricket. A fourth son, Martin, played club cricket in Christchurch. He published an autobiography, Innings of a Lifetime, in 1993. In later life, he enjoyed lawn bowls. He died, aged 91, at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Christchurch, reportedly from a stroke, some six weeks after hip replacement surgery. On 20 January 2017, Walter Hadlee's son, Sir Richard Hadlee, spoke about a project he has undertaken about his father 's 1949 England tour as New Zealand captain. He shared how Walter Hadlee was an important figure in his life.

Sutcliffe was a successful left-hand batsman. His batting achievements on tour in England in 1949, which included four fifties and a century in the Tests, earned him the accolade of being one of Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year. He captained New Zealand in four Tests in the early 1950s, losing three of them and drawing the other. None of Sutcliffe's 42 Tests resulted in a New Zealand victory. In 1949 Sutcliffe was named the inaugural New Zealand Sportsman of the Year, and in 2000 was named as New Zealand champion sportsperson of the decade for the 1940s. Early life Sutcliffe was born at Ponsonby, New Zealand. He was a brilliant schoolboy cricketer,Brittenden, R.T. (1958) Great Days in New Zealand Cricket, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, p. 157. and spent two years at teacher training college before joining the army.Wisden obituary He scored heavily in matches he was able to play while serving with New Zealand forces in Egypt and Italy in the Second World War.Brittenden, p. 157. His first-class career didn't get under way until he returned to New Zealand in 1946 from service in Japan after the war.Brittenden, p. 101. Batting highlights Sutcliffe established himself in his first international match when he scored 197 and 128 in the same match for Otago against MCC at Dunedin in March 1947. In the first innings he brought up his century with a six. He made his Test debut a few days later, scoring 58 in New Zealand's only innings and adding 133 for the first wicket with Walter Hadlee. In consecutive seasons of first-class cricket in New Zealand he made 722 runs at an average of 103.14 in 1946‚Äì47 with three centuries, 911 runs at 111.22 in 1947‚Äì48 with four centuries, and 511 runs at 85.16 in 1948‚Äì49 with three centuries. On the 1949 tour of England, he scored 243 and 100 not out in the same match against Essex at Southend, and went on to total 2,627 runs on the tour at an average of 59.70. He made two triple- hundreds in his career with 355 for Otago against Auckland in 1949‚Äì50 and 385 against Canterbury in 1952‚Äì53. The score of 385 stood as the record highest score by a left-handed batsman until 1994, when Brian Lara hit 501. Playing for New Zealand against India at New Delhi in 1955‚Äì56, he scored 230 not out, which was then a Test record for New Zealand. New Zealand tour of South Africa: 1953‚Äì54 Sutcliffe is especially noted for an innings of 80 not out against South Africa in Johannesburg on Boxing Day 1953. New Zealand's batsmen were routed by South African fast bowler Neil Adcock on a green wicket. Sutcliffe was hit in the head by Adcock and, having left the field to receive hospital treatment, returned to the crease swathed in bandages. He took on the bowling, hitting a number of sixes, until the ninth wicket fell. The New Zealand fast bowler Bob Blair, next man in, was understood to be back at the team hotel distraught as his fiancee had been killed in the Tangiwai disaster two days earlier. Sutcliffe started to walk off only to see Blair walk out. Despite the presence of 23,000 fans, silence enveloped the ground. 33 runs were added in 10 minutes before Blair was out. New Zealand lost the Test match by a considerable margin.

Timo Sirainen originated Dovecot and first released it in July 2002. Dovecot developers primarily aim to produce a lightweight, fast and easy-to-set-up open-source email server. The primary purpose of Dovecot is to act as mail storage server. Mail is delivered to the server using some mail delivery agent (MDA) and stored for later access with an email client (mail user agent, or MUA). Dovecot can also act as mail proxy server, forwarding connection to another mail server, or act as a lightweight MUA in order to retrieve and manipulate mail on remote server for e.g. mail migration. According to the Open Email Survey, as of 2020, Dovecot has an installed base of at least 2.9million IMAP servers, and has a global market share of 76.9% of all IMAP servers. The results of the same survey in 2019 gave figures of 2.6million and 76.2%, respectively. Features Dovecot can work with standard mbox, Maildir, and its own native high-performance dbox formats. It is fully compatible with UW IMAP and Courier IMAP servers‚Äô implementation of them, as well as mail clients accessing the mailboxes directly. Dovecot also includes a mail delivery agent (called Local delivery agent in Dovecot's documentation) and an LMTP server, with optional Sieve filtering support. Dovecot supports a variety of authentication schemas for IMAP, POP and message submission agent (MSA) access, including CRAM-MD5 and the more secure DIGEST-MD5. With version 2.2, some new features have been added to Dovecot, e.g. additional IMAP command extensions, dsync has been rewritten or optimized, and shared mailboxes now support per-user flags. Version 2.3 adds a message submission agent, Lua scripting for authentication, and some other improvements. Apple Inc. includes Dovecot for email services since Mac OS X Server 10.6 Snow Leopard. In 2017, Mozilla, via the Mozilla Open Source Support program, conducted a security audit on the Dovecot software, the first public audit of the Dovecot code.

Its main campus is located in Fisciano while the Faculty of Medicine is located in Baronissi. It is organized in ten faculties. History Salerno's Schola Medica Salernitana was the most important medical school in Europe between the 10th and 13th centuries. Following the rise of university medical schools, it briefly merged with the University of Naples, which moved to Salerno from 1253 to 1258 before returning to Naples and establishing its own medical school there. Meanwhile, the University of Montpellier displaced Salerno as the most prestigious medical school internationally and by the 14th century the latter had ceased to exist. The modern University of Salerno traces its origin to the Istituto Universitario di Magistero ‚ÄúGiovanni Cuomo‚Äù, a teacher training college founded in 1944 with this renowned and ancient tradition in mind. In 1968 the institute became a State university, the University of Salerno, and it has since seen a great increase in student numbers. Organization The University of Salerno offers degrees in 10 faculties: * Faculty of Arts and Philosophy * Faculty of Economics * Faculty of Education * Faculty of Engineering * Faculty of Foreign language and literature * Faculty of Law * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Political Science The library \\"biblioteca Eduardo R. Caianiello\\" offers students over 400,000 volumes and constitutes one of the major collections of books in Italy. = ICSR Mediterranean Knowledge = In May 2015 the University of Salerno saw the establishment of a new research institute, the International Centre for Studies and Research \\"Mediterranean Knowledge\\",http://www.mediterraneanknowledge.org/ composed by 14 Research Units located in universities of the Mediterranean countries. The ICSR, that has its administrative office at the University of Salerno, aims at favouring research and dissemination of knowledge about the most important topics of the Mediterranean Basin.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is also nicknamed as the \\"City of the Golden Sunrise/Sunshine\\" and aspiring to be the \\"King City of the East\\". Its cityhood was settled by the Supreme Court of the Philippines when it decided with finality on April 12, 2007, the constitutionality of its city charter, Republic Act 9394, which conferred upon and elevated the status of the municipality of Borongan into a component city of the province of Eastern Samar.* Etymology Pronounced bo-r√≥ng-gan, the name Borongan was taken from the local word \\"borong\\", which in the Waray-Waray language means \\"fog\\". The mountainous terrains surrounding Borongan is covered by a heavy veil of fog which can usually be seen during the cold and raining seasons and in the early hours of the morning. Because of this characteristic, the pre-hispanic natives attributed the name borongan to the place, which was then a fragmented commune of households. History Its development into a town, and eventually into a city, is traced back to the early 1600 out of the scattered hamlets located on the banks of the adjacent Guiborongani (Borongan or Sabang) River and Lo-om River. Guiborongani was the larger settlement and was later on called Borongan because of the heavy fog that usually covered the place. The people inhabiting the eastern coast of Samar were originally called \\"Ibabao\\" during the pre-Spanish period. As early as 1595, or 74 years after Ferdinand Magellan's landing in Homonhon (now an island barangay of Guiuan, Eastern Samar) Spanish Jesuit missionary priests from mission centers in Leyte began to evangelize the southern portion of the island of Samar. The first evangelical mission was established in Tinago, Western Samar and gradually expanded to Catubig. In 1614 Palapag was selected as the mission center of the Ibabao region or the north-eastern coast of the island; from this mission center in turn was the eastern coast of Samar subsequently evangelized. The missionaries proselytized to the inhabitants in the faith, raised stone churches, and protected the people from the Muslim predatory/piratical raids from the south. This is probably the reason why the town itself was established some distance away from the shoreline and built on a hill overlooking the northern banks of the Lo-om River. In fact, the old Catholic church convent has its own self-contained water supply: a deep dugout well lined with big blocks of ancient hewn stones located underneath the convent building itself. The major settlements then were Borongan, Bacod/Jubasan/Paric (now Dolores), Tubig (Taft), Sulat, Libas/Nonoc (now San Julian), Butag (now Guiuan) and Balangiga. The development of Borongan was greatly influenced by the religious missions of the Jesuits during the period 1604‚Äì1768, and the Franciscans from 1768 to 1868. Borongan was established as a pueblo on September 8, 1619. On this date, the Commandancia and the Very Reverend Father Superior of the Jesuits from Palapag, a town of Northern Samar, went to Ibabao to install the first priest of Borongan, Fr. Manuel Martinez, who served up to 1627. At the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1898, Borongan was the site of an uprising led by the Pulahanes. The first public municipal officials were Sr. Magno Abenis, President, and Sr. Andres Hipe, Vice-President, who held office from 1899 to 1903. After the Japanese occupation in 1941-1945, the town was henceforth led by a mayor and a vice mayor. Hilarion Basada and Ignacio Brozas were the first mayor and vice mayor, respectively, from 1945 to 1947. Borongan was legally constituted as a capital town when Eastern Samar was created as a separate province under Republic Act No. 4221 which was enacted on June 19, 1965. Its first municipal mayor as the capital town of Eastern Samar was Luis Capito. On June 21, 2007, Borongan became the first city in Eastern Samar. However, it subsequently lost its cityhood, along with 15 other cities, after the Supreme Court of the Philippines granted a petition filed by the League of Cities of the Philippines, and declared the cityhood law (RA 9394) which granted the town its city status, unconstitutional. The said 16 cities, the court ruled, did not meet the requirements for cityhood. Geography The City of Borongan is located along the middle coastal part of the province of Eastern Samar. The city center itself is situated along the northern banks of the Lo-om River and is set back a little distance away from the shoreline of Borongan Bay. The province itself comprises a part of the Eastern Visayas region (Region VIII) of the Republic of the Philippines. The city is bounded on the north by the municipality of San Julian, in the south by the municipality of Maydolong, in the west by the Samar municipalities of Hinabangan, Calbiga, Pinabacdao and Basey, and in the east by the Pacific Ocean. The city's territory include the islands of Ando, Monbon, and Divinubo in Borongan Bay. =Barangays= The city is subdivided into 61 Barangays: =Climate= Demographics According to the 2007 census conducted by the CBMS, Borongan had a total population of 59,354 people in 10,699 households.Philippine Statistics Authority This rose to 64,457 people in the 2010 census. As of the , it has a population of . The local dialect is Waray- Waray and some locals are able to speak and understand Cebuano, locals are literate in both English and Filipino. Boronganons are predominantly Roman Catholic, but it also has other small Christian as well as minority religious sects. Economy =Livelihood= Borongan's main product is copra. It has lively commercial activity throughout the year not only catering to the needs of the local city populace but serving as well as the central business hub of the entire province of Eastern Samar. Many families rely on coastal and deep- sea fishing as well as lowland and upland farming as means of livelihood. Others have spouses, children, parents or other relatives working in Manila or in other places within the Philippines or abroad either as professionals, contract workers or domestic helpers who regularly remit part of their earnings to their families back home. The single biggest employer of its local populace is the government. =Commercial Activity= Borongan City has a wet market located a little upstream and beside the northern bank of the Lo-om River in the Puray district of Barangay H (Tarusan) selling the usual foodstuffs like rice & corn grains, dried & fresh fish (either caught locally or brought in frozen from Catbalogan City or Guiuan as well as other nearby towns), pork, beef, chicken, carabeef, preserved meats, vegetables, fruits, condiments & spices, rootcrops, native cakes and the like. The place also sells locally-made and beautiful native basketware. In 2005, the municipality (then) saw the opening of the largest and only Mall in Eastern Samar, the Uptown Mall which opened in 2005 for business operations and is located along the national highway in Barangay Songco at the northern fringe of the city. Appliance stores, mini-groceries and 'sari-sari' stores also abound throughout the length and breadth of the city selling items ranging from basic necessities to supplies for recreational and entertainment activities. There are several hardware stores that also operate catering to the needs of the city's construction industry. The city has numerous restaurants and eateries offering local cuisine randomly located throughout the city limits while nightspots can be found mostly along the length of Baybay Boulevard at the eastern edge of the city immediately abutting the shoreline of Borongan Bay. Major and new oil companies have their own oil refueling stations within the city limits selling engine lubricants, kerosene as well as regular, unleaded and premium gasoline and diesel fuels. Now, Borongan City boasts several large establishments that opened throughout the years. These includes several department stores and another Mall that opened in 2017. Most of these establishments are located within the city proper such as GrandMart, Novo Shirts and Jeans, and the recently opened 576 Emporium. The second mall that opened in the city is the J&F; Mall, which houses a Puregold Franchise. A Jollibee Franchise also opened in 2016, located in the city proper. Tourism Borongan City's pristine and undisturbed forests contain spectacular streams, river rapids, waterfalls and caves sought after by nature lovers, trekkers and spelunkers - locals and foreign visitors alike. With its vast virginal landscape, most of its scenic spots can be reached by those who have the time and energy. There is said to be a famed hidden cave in one of the offshore islands of Borongan Bay containing the long-boned remains and antique artifacts (i.e. necklaces, porcelain, etc.) of apparently ancient people whose true history have been obscured by the mists of time and only snippets of which have survived to this day in tales and legends among the local folk who continue to zealously preserve as well as guard and protect them from the curious and from the occasional vandal/looter, believing that allowing such remains and artifacts to be disturbed or taken away will bring bad luck or misfortune to the nearby local inhabitants. =Festivals= The City celebrates its annual Fiesta celebration in honor of its Patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary. Albeit the actual Feast day is on September 8, the celebration is usually a month long as each Barangay will hold its own \\"Barangay Night\\" where barangays would have a barangay-wide party through programs held in their respective Barangay Plazas. At the same time, schools would also have their annual reunions and respective \\"School Night\\". The series of celebrations is in anticipation of the actual Feast day.  Padul- ong Festival  :The Festival illustrates the legend of a mysterious ‚ÄúLady in White‚Äù who allegedly visits the Hamorawon Spring, behind the Hamorawon Park, regularly. According to the legend, the Lady in White has been blessing the spring waters with miraculous healing powers. On September 7, Borongan City offers mass in the wee hours of the morning, in the chapel of Barangay Punta Maria, signifying that the Padul-ong Festival has officially started. From the chapel, a small figure of the Blessed Virgin Mary will be transferred to Rawis Port through a fluvial procession where boat owners can join along with the official boat carrier of the small image across Rawis Bay.:The figure would then be paraded through the town going to Borongan Cathedral. At the Borongan City plaza, different schools would reenact the town‚Äôs old legend on how the figure was brought to the Philippines. This is done as a contest, where several schools from the different municipalities, and schools within the City would compete among themselves through their performances. The festival commemorates the day the town received the figure of the Patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary, all the way from Portugal.  Lechon Festival  :The city government took the initiative to hold a lechon festival to coincide with the city fiesta after the verbal endorsement of Kris Aquino during her visit to the City, after having tasted the City's own version of the Lechon. The festival coincides with the Fiesta celebration, where participants would showcase their own styles of cooking the famous filipino dish. The festival is celebrated by parading the participants' dishes dressed in elaborate costumes or floats, and thereafter will be shared in the main competition held in the city plaza. The festival is concluded by a competition among the local lechon butchers to showcase their own recipes, the dishes they paraded, and whoever will win will be awarded by monetary prizes and recognition. When the festival was first held, Kris Aquino was said to have been one of the principal sponsors. =Surfing & Skimboarding= Being part of Eastern Samar, the surfing capital of the Visayas, Borongan is blessed with several surfing spots. More often than not, these spots are uncrowded, easily making it a surfer's paradise. The city's waves are at their best during the Amihan season which runs from November to April. Among the numerous surf sites in the City, the following are considered to be the top pick for surfers and tourists: ;Baybay Boulevard (Borongan Bay): Known as the birthplace of surfing in the Visayas, this is the nearest surf spot from Borongan town proper. This surf spot has a sandy bottom, right hand rivermouth beach break. Perfect for both beginners and advance surfers. ;Pirates Cove Beach and Surf Resort: A 5-minute drive from Borongan town proper brings you to this 2-hectare private reef, marine sanctuary and water sports recreation area. This is an exposed reef break facing the Pacific Ocean filled with rocks and corals. ;Sulangan Beach: A left and right hand steady beach break that is ideal for beginners. A good place to learn how to surf. ;Lalawigan Beach: Still part of Borongan, this barangay is rarely visited. Only advanced surfers frequent the area due to its rough waves and strong current. ;Guintagican Beach: A beautiful 2 km beach with white sand. It has a left and right hand beach break with inconsistent surf. During the summer season, it tends to be flat. Also ideal for beginners. =Beaches= Sunrise viewed from Borongan City's Baybay Boulevard. Borongan City has many beaches, the most notable of which can be found in Divinubo Island and in Ando Island, both of which boast of white sand beaches, vibrant coral formations alive with teeming marine life in sparkling clear blue waters, incidentally ideal also for diving and snorkeling. Cabong gray-sand beach is a favorite destination of the locals, with excursionists, bathers and picnic-goers spilling over from one end of the beach to the other especially during special occasions, weekends and holidays. The strip of white-sand beach in Guintagican or Punta Maria is also a good bet, although it takes some effort to get there as it is several kilometers away from the town proper and accessible only through a feeder road, the final stretch of which can be reach on foot only because of the narrow width of the footpath. =Islands and Island Beaches= * Ando Island White Sand Beach * Butay island (located at the middle of Lo-om River between the upstream concrete bridge connecting the city proper to and from Barangay Taboc and the downstream steel-and-concrete bridge connecting the city proper to and from Barangay Alang-alang) * Divinubo Island White Sand Beach * Monbon Island White Sand Beach * Pamuloton Island Beach (Tabunan) =City Parks= The Hamorawon park is located at the center of the city proper itself and can easily be located by the presence of the giant acacia tree beside it. It contains the stylized rendition of a concrete giant clamshell the upper half of which being held up by two mermaids while at its base are two crocodiles with their mouths agape. This giant clamshell served as the then town's cultural stage where social presentations were held while the fenced grounds fronting it served as the venue for social gatherings. This was the brainchild of then Mayor Pablo \\"Buaya\\" Rosales. On its left side but still within the park grounds is the city tourism building. From underneath this giant clamshell bubbles and flows the Hamorawon natural spring, the only one place in the entire province of Eastern Samar which has a naturally occurring fresh-water spring, flowing from the very center of the city itself towards the Lo-om River a short distance downstream. The waters of this spring has been said to be miraculous the site itself having allegedly been the place where appearances of a lady in white (supposed to be the patroness saint of the city) have reportedly been seen. Unfortunately, access to this natural water source has of late been impeded and virtually blocked, its previous access road having been long fenced off leaving the spring almost unnoticeable already to busy passersby. Local Government As the provincial capital, provincial government institutions are located in the city. The city government also has its own executive, legislative and judicial bodies. ;Executive The seat of the executive branch of the local government of Borongan is at the city hall located at the city proper itself with the city mayor acting as the local chief executive. ;Legislative The legislative department is represented by the local Sangguniang Panglungsod composed of ten (10) elected members headed by the city vice mayor as the presiding officer thereof. ;Judicial *Regional Trial Court, Branches I & II - both located at the Hall of Justice Bldg., Provincial Capitol Complex in Barangay Alang-alang. *Municipal Trial Court - also located at the Hall of Justice Bldg., Provincial Capitol Complex in Barangay Alang-alang. ;Constitutional Bodies *Commission on Audit *Commission on Elections *Civil Service Commission =Peace and Order= The local inhabitants are generally peace-loving and law-abiding citizens who follow all the laws, ordinances, rules and regulations promulgated by the duly-constituted authorities, be they national or local. Except for the lingering insurgency problem, which however is restricted to the hinterland barangays, does not affect the normal course of political and business activities of the city. The place has no major peace and order nor internal security problems. Infrastructure =Transportation= The City of Borongan can be reached from Manila or Tacloban primarily by means of land or sea transport. The Borongan Airport is already minimally serviceable. Sea The Port of Borongan is classified as a national port and can accommodate medium-draft sea vessels, linking the town with the other coastal and riverine towns of the province as well as major coastal cities of Eastern Visayas, Central Visayas and Bicol regions. Access to and from the outlying inhabited offshore islands of Borongan Bay is either through motorized as well as sail- or oar-driven outrigger bancas. Land Bus transport, airconditioned and ordinary, is the dominant means of public land conveyance to Borongan City from Manila (and vice versa) passing overland through the Pan-Philippine Highway (Maharlika Highway) through southern Luzon, a short roll on, roll off 1-hour boat ride across the San Bernardino Strait from Matnog, Sorsogon to Allen, Northern Samar, then southwards to Catbalogan City, Western Samar, east across the mountainous and forested geographical spine of the island, then southwards again from the town of Taft until finally entry into the city on the eastern coast of Samar. There are also ordinary mini- buses and air-conditioned shuttle vans from Tacloban City going to Borongan City (and vice versa). Another route from Tacloban City is through the Pan- Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway on a west-to-east-to-north course that traverses the southern coastal fringe of the island of Samar crossing the San Juanico Bridge from Tacloban City turning right at the junction southwards to Basey and then Marabut, Samar then eastward across the provincial boundary to Lawa-an in Eastern Samar passing by the famous municipality of Balangiga, turning left at the junction past Quinapondan town northward to the municipality of Gen. MacArthur and onwards to Borongan City itself. The main forms of public mass transport in and around the city are motorized tricycles, motorcycles, passenger jeepneys, multicabs and bicycles. There is no taxicab service available within the city. Air The Borongan City Airport is located at Barangay Punta Maria. The Airport has undergone several improvements through the years since its construction during the Second World War, where it was constructed as an emergency air strip for the military. The Air strip is serviceable to smaller aircraft, such as turbo-propelled Airplanes, which was seen when the airport had chartered flights on different occasions. Currently there is once a week commercial flight Borongan-Cebu- Borongan and Borongan-Clark-Borongan by Leading Edge Air Services Corporation (LEASCOR). Booking is done through Budgetmate Travel and Tours, Pashada Travel and Tours and King Aces Travel and Tours. =Communications= Landline telephone, cellular phone as well as internet (both landline and wireless) connections are available within the city limits and up to a certain limited distance from the city proper. Cable television is also available to city subscribers as well as to inhabitants up to a certain limited distance from the city proper. The city has a government-run FM radio station although it operates only on limited broadcast time at certain hours of the day. =Electric power= Main electric power supply to the city is through an interconnection with the Leyte electric power grid that comes from the electricity generated by the Tongonan geothermal power plant located in the adjacent island of Leyte. The distribution of the power supply within the city and the entire province of Eastern Samar is operated and managed by the Eastern Samar Electric Cooperative (ESAMELCO) Education Borongan City has many elementary schools, high schools, colleges and a lone university. It has the highest literacy rate among the municipalities in the whole province of Eastern Samar. =Elementary Schools= * Ando Elementary School * Bato Elementary School * Balacdas Elementary School * Banuyo Elementary School * Baras Elementary School * Benowangan Elementary School * Bugas Elementary School * Cabalagnan Elementary School * Cabong Elementary School * Cagbonga Elementary School * Calingatngan Elementary School * Calico-an Elementary School * Camada Elementary School * Eugenio A.

Etymology The name of the municipality was taken from the Waray-waray word Hi Podlos ('the sly one'), the nickname given to a woman who was nearly kidnapped by marauding \\"Moros\\" (Muslims). A folk story in the town tells of two women who went to a coastal area called \\"Rawis\\" to gather seashells only to be confronted by Moro men. One of the women, who was quite observant to her surroundings, was able to escape with haste. The other woman, who was already being dragged by the Moros to their vinta, squirmed her way out of their clutches like an eel (, 'to slip from capture'), leaving them clutching her skirt while she fled triumphantly, earning the name Hi Podlos. It is said that this name was changed to Hi Porlos to name the place or the whole area of settlement and was modified further by the Spaniards into its current spelling: Giporlos.https://sites.google.com/site/lgugiporlos/home/legend Barangays Giporlos is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.

According to the , it has a population of people. Guiuan played a significant part in Philippine history. In the 16th century, when Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines, it is believed that he first landed on the island of Homonhon, which lies within the municipality. It is probably because of this that the majority of the population of the town are Catholics. The town's church, the Church of the Immaculate Conception, is one of the oldest in the country. During the Second World War, Guiuan served as one of the Alliance's bases. Now all that is left of the American occupation are concrete slabs which once served as the foundations of a vast supply depot, and an air strip, which now serves as the town's own airport. As well as a rich historical background, Guiuan has many scenic spots. Being a coastal town on the Pacific side, the town has many white-sand beaches that are suitable for swimming and surfing. The Guiuan Church is currently in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the Baroque Churches of the Philippines (Extension). A proposal has been suggested by scholars to make a separate UNESCO inclusion for the Old Centre of Guiuan which includes the Guiuan Church. The same would be made for other churches listed in UNESCO's tentative sites, where each town plaza and surrounding heritage buildings would be added. No government agency has yet to take action on the proposal. In 8 November 2013, it was the first town in the Philippines that was hit by Typhoon Haiyan (Super Typhoon Yolanda). Geography Guiuan's shoreline The municipality of Guiuan is located at the southeasternmost tip of Samar Island. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Mercedes, on the east by the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Surigao Strait, and on the west by the Leyte Gulf. Clustered around the municipality are numerous islands and islets such as Manicani, Calicoan, Sulangan, Candulo, Homonhon, Suluan and Tubabao. They are protected as part of the marine reserve known as the Guiuan Protected Landscape and Seascape. Guiuan is south of Borongan and from Tacloban. It has a total land area of 175.49 square kilometres. It is composed of sixty (60) barangays and the only town in the province with biggest number of island barangays. =Barangays= Guiuan is politically subdivided into 60 barangays, 37 of which is located in the mainland of Guiuan, i.e. the portion of Guiuan that is contiguous with the Samar Island, and the remaining 23 in the islands surrounding the mainland. Mainland barangays The Guiuan Town Plaza in 2019, part of Poblacion Ward 7 Poblacion barangays: The poblacion, or town center, is located on the southwestern coastal area of the Guiuan mainland, facing the Leyte Gulf. Other mainland barangays: Island barangays View of the Leyte Gulf facing Southwest from the Guiuan Integrated Transport Terminal, showing the islands of Homonhon (left, nearly invisible due to haze), Manicani (near center), and Inatunglan (to the immediate right of Manicani) Barangays in Calicoan Island and neighboring islets: * Baras * Ngolos * Pagnamitan * Sulangan Barangays in Tubabao Island and neighboring islets: * Camparang * San Antonio * San Juan * San Pedro * Trinidad Barangays in Manicani Island: * Banaag * Buenavista * Hamorawon * San Jose Barangays in Homonhon Island: * Bitaugan * Cagusu-an * Canawayon * Casuguran * Culasi * Habag * Inapulangan * Pagbabangnan Other island barangays: * Victory - Victory Group of Islands * Suluan - Suluan Island =Climate= History Guiuan is widely known for two significant events in history 423 years apart. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan, first European to set foot on Philippine soil, landed in Homonhon, now part of Guiuan. In 1944, the American Forces landed on the island of Suluan where they fought their first battle in the Philippine territory three days before Gen. Mac Arthur stormed the beaches of Leyte. The facade of Guiuan Church The name of the town originated from its geographical location. The first settlers named the town Guibang when they discovered a sharp break in the mountain range (, 'partly chiseled off') which screens the town from the Pacific Ocean in the East. Subsequently, settlers modified its name to Guiuan. The occurrence of World War II shook the town and people moved to the mountains to find comfort. On June 28, 1943, several Japanese soldiers set foot on Guiuan soil. Not as fearful and brutal as they were thought of by the local populace, a cordial relation soon existed between the conquered and the conquerors. Evacuees came down from the mountains and resumed a normal urban life. Except for a few killings of suspected traitors by both Japanese, Filipino soldiers and local guerillas, not a drop of blood was shed needlessly. This made Guiuan one of the few places in the islands where World War II did not leave so many tragic memories. The first sign of liberation of the town came on November 27, 1944, when a US Navy submarine chaser steamed the harbor for reconnaissance duty. On December 1, 1944, a fleet of LCTs, Liberty ships and barges poured into the Guiuan Bay to unload machines that was to transform Guiuan into one of the biggest Naval Bases in the Far East that time. In 1949, the International Refugee Organisation made an appeal to tackle the displacement crisis caused by the war and a precursor to the UNHCR. It wanted new homes for thousands of White Russians in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution (Russian Revolutions) and subsequent civil war. More than 5,000 of them, under the care of John Maximovitch (Saint John of Shanghai and San Francisco), the Orthodox Archbishop of Shanghai who would later be canonised, were taken to the island of Tubabao, located a couple of hundred metres from the coast of Guiuan. In 1952, the sitios of Talisay, Bagambang, Calamrisan, Lo-ok and Barawalti, belonging to Barrio Tubabao, were separated and created into the barrio of Trinidad. On November 10, 1978, Proclamation No. 1801 was issued declaring Guiuan as a Tourist Zone and Marine Reserve under the administration and control of the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA). On November 8, 2013, the city suffered heavy damage, along with 107 fatalities, 16 missing and over 3,626 injuries, as it was hit by the eye of Typhoon Haiyan (Super Typhoon Yolanda) with maximum ten-minute sustained wind speeds of 230 km/h (145 mph). Haiyan made its first landfall over Guiuan at 04:40 PhST. Almost every building was heavily damaged or deroofed, including the designated typhoon shelters, the Catholic Church, hospital and gymnasium. However, one house in Lactason remained intact because of the owner's effort to hold it in place with her bare hands. The woman was later identified as Mana Maring, a moron (a Filipino delicacy) maker and vendor. Demography Guiuan recorded a total population of 38,694 in 2000, which rose to 47,037 in 2010 and 52,991 in 2015. It has the second largest population in Eastern Samar (after Borongan) with a population density of 270 persons per km2. Majority or 97.7% of the Guiuananons speak the Waray-Waray language. Less than 3.0% speak Cebuano (including the Boholano dialect) and Tagalog. A few percentage can converse in English, with varying degrees of proficiency. Economy downtown Guiuan Guiuan is classified as a second income class municipality as of CY 2008. Its Total Financial Resources amounted to 67.71 million pesos. Its Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) represents 78.0% of its total financial resources. Fishing boats anchored at the Guiuan Integrated Transport Terminal (Homonhon Island is visible at the horizon) Being a fishing community and the only municipality with the most number of island barangays, the town is rich in fishery and aquatic resources. It is considered by the fisheries authorities as the best fishing belt in the region. The coastal waters offer almost all species of marine life: euchuema, abalone, ornamental fish, lobster and the golden cowry (known for its extraordinary golden sheen). They also offer delicacies, shellcraft products as well as fresh and processed marine products. Existing land use indicates a predominance of agriculture which covers 38.2% of the total land area. Most of the agricultural lands are dominantly planted with coconut trees. Other major crops include vegetables, root crops, palay, corn, banana and other fruit trees, coffee and pineapple. The municipality is likewise rich in mineral resources. It has an estimated mineral reserve of bauxite, nickel and titaferous magnitie of more than 26.7 million metric tons. Transportation Calicoan Island ;By air Guiuan Airport has a 2,800-metre (9,200-ft) runway which can service light private planes, chartered cargo and military planes. The Guiuan Airport was upgraded in 2010. Cebu-based airline Mid-Sea Express had scheduled flights from Cebu City to Guiuan twice weekly on Saturdays and Mondays, using a 19-seater Jetstream 32 aircraft. Service started in 2012 but has now been discontinued. ;By land The town is accessible by land with highway connection from Tacloban City, about three-four hours travel. Several buses and vans regularly shuttle passengers to Guiuan. It is also accessible from Borongan City. Alternatively, several bus companies have daily trips to Guiuan from Manila. Travel time is approximately twenty-one hours. Since the town is a coastal municipality, it has a small seaport operational throughout the year. Point of Interest ;Sulangan Church The church is also known as The Shrine of St. Anthony of Padua. It is known to both the locals and pilgrims around Eastern Visayas because of being miraculous. Saint Anthony of Padua is considered the patron saint for lost items, articles, people, or even spiritual goods. Many people visit the church to ask Saint Anthony even the most impossible wishes and the saint is believed to grant them. ;Linao Cave Linao Cave is one of the most famous attractions in Guiuan because of its crystal clear water. The cave is named linao which means ‚Äúclear‚Äù in Waray. Utilities PAGASA-DOST Guiuan Weather Station in Barangay Sapao Telephone companies operating in the municipality includes TELECOM, Globelines and Bayantel. Smart and Globe cellular phone companies are also operational. The town also has a local radio station, Radyo Natin Guiuan (103.7 MHz), serving Guiuan and neighboring areas in Eastern Visayas. The Guiuan gymnasium In 2004, Eastern Samar Electric Cooperative (ESAMELCO) was able to energize Guiuan, Calicoan Island up to Sulangan covering 37 out of 60 barangays. Island barangays are served with electricity through generator sets either privately owned or operated by the barangay council. However, electricity shortages are frequent and subscribers experience weekly power failures, lasting for 10 to 12 hours or for 24 hours in severe cases. Guiuan is also the site of one of the weather stations of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, located in Barangay Sapao. Positioned at above sea level, the facility consists of a Surface Synoptic Station for usual weather observation and a Doppler weather radar station for detecting intensity (reflectivity) and velocity (by Doppler effect) of distant weather elements. The radar station was built and renovated with the aid of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

Based on the 1972 novel of the same name by Trevanian, the film is about an art history professor, mountain climber and former assassin once employed by a secret United States government agency who is blackmailed into returning to his deadly profession and do one more \\"sanction,\\" a euphemism for killing. He agrees to join an international climbing team in Switzerland planning an ascent of the Eiger north face in order to complete a second sanction to avenge the murder of an old friend. The film was produced by Robert Daley for Eastwood's Malpaso Company, with Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown as executive producers, and co-starred George Kennedy, Vonetta McGee and Jack Cassidy. Principal photography started on August 12, 1974, and ended in late September 1974. The picture was filmed on location on the Eiger mountain and Zurich in Switzerland, in Monument Valley and Zion National Park in the American Southwest, and in Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey in California. Special equipment and handheld cameras were employed to film the climbing sequences. Eastwood did his own climbing and stuntwork under dangerous conditions. Twenty-six-year-old British climber David Knowles died on the Eiger during the production. The film score was composed by John Williams. The Eiger Sanction was released in New York City on May 21, 1975, and received mixed reviews. The general reaction among many reviewers offered criticism of the story and screenplay, and praise for the climbing footage and action sequences. The film, which was made with a budget of $9 million, earned $14,200,000 at the box office. The Eiger Sanction was first released in DVD format on December 15, 1998, and in Blu-ray format on November 10, 2015 by Universal Studios.  Plot  Art professor and mountaineer Jonathan Hemlock (Clint Eastwood) is a retired government assassin called on to return to work for two more \\"sanctions,\\" a euphemism for officially approved killings. During his career with a secret government agency called \\"C2,\\" Hemlock amassed a private collection of 21 rare masterpiece paintings, paid for from his previous sanctions. The director of C2, Dragon (Thayer David), is an albino ex-Nazi confined to semi-darkness and kept alive by blood transfusions. Dragon wants Hemlock to kill two men responsible for the death of another government agent, code name Wormwood. Insisting he is retired, Hemlock refuses until Dragon threatens to expose Hemlock's art collection to the IRS. Hemlock agrees, and travels to Zurich, where he carries out the first sanction for $20,000, twice his usual fee (), and a letter guaranteeing no trouble from the IRS. Returning from Europe, Hemlock meets C2 courier Jemima Brown (Vonetta McGee), who seduces him and, while he is asleep, steals his money and IRS exemption letter. Dragon agrees to return them if Hemlock completes the second sanction. Hemlock is reluctant, but agrees when he learns that the C2 agent killed, Wormwood, was in fact his old friend Henri Baq. Hemlock is an ex-Green Beret and he and Baq served together during the Vietnam War, where Baq saved his life. Dragon agrees to pay him $100,000 () plus expenses, and tells him the target is a member of an international mountain climbing team that will soon attempt an ascent of the north face of the Eiger mountain in Switzerland. Hemlock will be the American member of the team, and must kill one of the climbers‚ÄîDragon is unsure of the target's identity other than the man walks with a limp. Hemlock travels to Arizona to train at a climbing school run by a friend, Ben Bowman (George Kennedy), who whips him back into shape with the help of an attractive Native American woman named George (later revealed to be Bowman's daughter). Hemlock also encounters an enemy, Miles Mellough (Jack Cassidy), a former ally from the military who years before had betrayed him in Southeast Asia. Mellough somehow knows a great deal of what Hemlock is planning. He tries to kill Hemlock by hiring George to drug him, but Hemlock survives. Later Hemlock lures Mellough and his bodyguard into the desert, shoots the bodyguard, and leaves Mellough to die in the sun. Hemlock travels to Switzerland with Bowman, the \\"ground man\\" or supervisor of the climb, and meets the other members of the climbing party at the Hotel Bellevue des Alpes at Kleine Scheidegg. The headstrong and condescending German member, Karl Freytag (Reiner Sch√∂ne), presents his proposed route up the mountain, and the team agrees that he will lead the party. The following morning, the men begin their ascent of the Eiger north face, but soon the weather conditions become poor. The French climber is struck by falling rocks and later dies. With Hemlock now leading, the surviving members retreat towards a tunnel window that connects to a railroad station inside the mountain, carrying the dead climber between them. At the last moment, Freytag and the Austrian, Anderl Meyer (Michael Grimm), fall to their deaths. Hemlock is saved, dangling alone a few meters from the tunnel window. Bowman and a rescue crew make their way through the Eiger to the tunnel window, where they attempt to throw a rope to Hemlock. Hemlock notices Bowman is limping, a sign that identifies him as Hemlock's target. Hemlock says, \\"You're limping, Ben,\\" reluctant to trust that Bowman will rescue him. Bowman throws him the rope, and Hemlock attaches it, then reluctantly cuts his own rope. He falls onto Bowman's rope, and is pulled into the tunnel to safety. On the train back to Kleine Scheidegg, Bowman admits he became involved with \\"the other side\\" years earlier but claims he had no idea that Hemlock's friend would be killed. Bowman explains he had become involved with Miles Mellough, to whom he was indebted for getting his daughter, George, off drugs. Back at Kleine Scheidegg, Bowman approaches Hemlock, looking to mend his relationship with the assassin. Hemlock takes a phone call from Dragon, who is convinced that Hemlock killed all three of the other climbers intentionally to ensure he killed the target. Hemlock tells Bowman that C2 believes the target died on the mountain, and that there is no reason to tell them otherwise. After Bowman leaves, Jemima Brown joins Hemlock and wonders if Dragon was correct.

It was Trevanian's first novel and was written as an intentional spoof of James Bond novels. Universal Studios purchased the film rights in November 1972, soon after the novel was published. In late November 1972 screenwriter Hal Dresner was hired to adapt the novel with the author Trevanian, credited as Rod Whitaker as a screenwriter. In April 1973 Paul Newman was cast in the lead role of Jonathan Hemlock. Dresner and Trevanian prepared two drafts of the screenplay, which were provided to Newman. Disappointed with the results and believing the story was too violent, Newman opted out of the project. In late 1973 Universal producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown approached Eastwood with the project. Eastwood saw serious flaws with the novel and the script, which had gone through three revisions and a rewrite by the time he read it. Eastwood was never interested in espionage as a subject or the spy thriller as a genre, but he was attracted to the project for two reasons. Disappointed with the way Universal handled his first directorial efforts‚ÄîPlay Misty for Me (1971) and Breezy (1973)‚Äîhe was looking to move to Warner Bros. where studio head Frank Wells was offering an open invitation, and Eiger represented a way to close out his contract. More importantly, the project offered him the opportunity to work in relative isolation on location in Switzerland away from the distractions of the studio and to work efficiently with a small cast and crew. On January 31, 1974, Universal announced that Eastwood was contracted to both star in and co- produce The Eiger Sanction with his own Malpaso Productions and Universal Pictures. In a 1976 interview with author Patrick McGilligan for Focus on Film, Eastwood described the essential problems with the novel: \\"The book has no ties. In other words, the character that is killed at the beginning has no relationship to anybody else. I just took it and tried to make the guy relate to the hero so the hero had some motivations. The way the book was written, he had no motivations for anything. He just went up there strictly for monetary gain, no other motivation, period.\\" Believing that improvements could be made to the script, Eastwood contacted novelist Warren B. Murphy ‚Äî known for his The Destroyer assassin series ‚Äî in February 1974 and asked for his assistance, despite Murphy's having never read the book nor written for a film before. Murphy read the novel and agreed to write the script, but he was unhappy with the novel's tone, which he believed patronized readers. Murphy completed a draft in late March and a revised script a month later. Eastwood also felt that the authenticity of the climbing sequences he envisioned would compensate for the narrative's shortcomings. From the beginning, Eastwood planned to shoot the mountaineering scenes on location, and that he would do his own climbing without a stunt double. \\"The challenge of it for me,\\" he would later explain, \\"was to actually shoot a mountain-type film on a mountain, not on sets. The only ones done in the past were all done on sets; the mountains were all papier-m√¢ch√© mountains.\\" In late May 1974, Universal announced that Eastwood would also direct the film, and that principal photography was scheduled to start on August 1, 1974, at the Eiger mountain in Switzerland. Universal's vice-president Jennings Lang would supervise the production. = Pre-production = As soon as he signed on to the project, Eastwood took complete control of the production. He worked with soundman Peter Pilafian to develop lightweight, disposable batteries to power a specially adapted camera and sound equipment needed to film on the mountain. He also hired Mike Hoover to serve as climbing adviser for the film. Hoover had made an Academy Award nominated documentary short titled Solo about his lone ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. Eastwood had seen and admired the documentary, and hired Hoover to train him on how to look professional during the climbing scenes, and to serve as principal cameraman on the more dangerous climbing sequences. Intent on doing his own climbing for the film, Eastwood accompanied Hoover to Yosemite in early July to train and climb the Lost Arrow Spire, a detached pillar in Yosemite Valley located adjacent to Upper Yosemite Falls. While he had done some rock climbing in his youth, the forty-four year old Eastwood was not prepared for the levels of difficulty presented by the climb. Hoover would later recall, \\"He looked up at me and said, 'Gee, I don't think I can make it.' I said, 'Well, Clint, you really don't have much choice, do you?' Then he reacted characteristically‚Äîhe got pissed off. He pulled in his chin and gritted his teeth and with absolutely no technique at all, just blood and guts, he mossed his way up. No skill, no brains, just pure muscle.\\" Meanwhile, George Kennedy, who had recently finished filming Thunderbolt and Lightfoot with Eastwood, was cast as Ben Bowman, Hemlock's friend and former climbing partner. Jack Cassidy was cast as the colorful and flamboyantly gay assassin Miles Mellough. Thayer David, a year before his role as a boxing promoter in Rocky, was cast as the albino Dragon (named \\"Yurasis Dragon\\" in the novel). Just prior to the start of filming, Vonetta McGee was cast as the African-American female C2 operative, Jemima Brown. In late July 1974, Eastwood, Kennedy, Hoover, and a small crew traveled to Monument Valley‚Äîdirector John Ford's favorite location for his Westerns‚Äîon the Arizona- Utah border to film a sequence that would be used in the film as a practice climb by the main characters of the Totem Pole, a rock spire with an diameter. Located within the lands of the Navajo Nation, the Totem Pole had religious significance to the Navajos who prohibited climbs on the formation. Hoover negotiated permission from the tribal authorities for his team to climb the Totem Pole to remove pitons and other climbing hardware embedded in the structure by previous climbers, restoring the monolith to pristine condition. The ascent was made by two climbers from Moab, Eric Bjornstad and Ken Wyrick, who were tasked with preparing the summit for the helicopter film crew and removing existing hardware. Upon attaining the summit, they were helicoptered off and Eastwood and Kennedy were lowered onto the eighteen-foot wide summit for one of Eastwood's happiest film-making memories, watching the sun setting over Monument Valley where many classic Westerns were filmed. = Filming = The Eiger north face Principal photography began on August 12, 1974 in Grindelwald, Switzerland, with a team of climbing experts and advisers from the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The climbers were based at the Hotel Bellevue des Alpes at Kleine Scheidegg, located below and between the Eiger and Lauberhorn peaks in the Bernese Oberland region. At in elevation, the north face of the Eiger, which means ogre in German, is renowned for its treacherous climbing, earning the German nickname Mordwand or \\"murder wall\\". By 1974, forty-one climbers had lost their lives trying to climb the forbidding edifice. Eastwood decided to take on the most dangerous work during the first two days of shooting. By midafternoon on August 13, as light began to fail, a wrap was called after shooting a rock slide sequence. While the team was preparing to be helicoptered off the north face, Hoover remembered they had not taken any footage from the climbers' point of view of the boulders crashing down on them. With his handheld camera, Hoover and twenty-six-year-old British climber David Knowles rappelled down to the ledge and took the needed footage. As they were gathering their gear, a huge rock broke free and smashed into the climbers, killing Knowles and leaving Hoover with a fractured pelvis and severely bruised muscles. Following an impromptu wake for Knowles, Eastwood considered canceling the production, but the climbers persuaded him to continue on, assuring him that they all knew the risks of their trade and did not want Knowles' death to be meaningless. On location in Zurich, Switzerland, September 1974 Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts‚Äîa decision met with disapproval by the director of the International School of Mountaineering, Dougal Haston, who experienced the dangers of the Eiger first hand having been with American climber John Harlin when he fell to his death. Cameraman Frank Stanley also thought climbing the perilous mountain to shoot a film was unnecessary. While filming on the Eiger, Stanley fell and sustained injuries that forced him to use a wheelchair for some time. Stanley blamed Eastwood for the accident because of lack of preparation, describing him as a director and actor as a \\"very impatient man who doesn't really plan his pictures or do any homework\\". One of the most dangerous stunts that Eastwood ever attempted involved him hanging from a rope four thousand feet above the valley floor in the penultimate scene. The scene required him to cut himself free so he could be pulled to safety by his rescuers. As he cuts the rope supporting his weight, he drops precariously before being saved by a rigged cable. Eastwood would later say, \\"I didn't want to use a stunt man, because I wanted to use a telephoto lens and zoom in slowly all the way to my face‚Äîso you could see it was really me.\\" After five weeks at the Eiger, the production unit traveled to Zurich to film the opening scenes of the film around the area of the Grossm√ºnster cathedral and the Limmat river, the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke bridge, the Caf√© Bausch√§nzli, the Kirchgasse, the Napfgasse, and the Restaurant Karl der Grosse. Eastwood and company returned to the United States to the American Southwest where filming resumed in Zion National Park in Utah, where scenes were shot at Zion-Mount Carmel Highway, Zion Lodge, Checkerboard Mesa, the Narrows, the Hanging Gardens, the bridge over the Virgin River, and the Cave Route below the Cerberus Gendarme. Additional scenes were also shot in Monument Valley at the Tyrolean Transfer, where a rope had been rigged by climber Eric Bjornstad, who noted that Eastwood was not only very fit but very capable when it came to performing physical stuntwork like this. Scenes were also shot at Rock Door mesa above Goulding's Lodge, where Eastwood and company stayed. After completing principal photography in late September 1974 in Carmel-by-the-Sea and Monterey in California, Eastwood hosted the cast and crew at his restaurant, the Hog's Breath Inn, for a wrap party. The Eiger Sanction was filmed in Technicolor, and was released to theaters with an aspect ratio of 2.35 : 1. = Post- production = Eastwood chose John Williams to compose the original music soundtrack for The Eiger Sanction‚Äîhis only score in the spy thriller genre. A main theme is presented initially on piano evoking a sense of sophistication and mystery, then given a much jazzier or pop rendition reminiscent of Lalo Schifrin's material. The most impressive sections of the score are the grand orchestral cues composed for the mountain scenes‚Äîpieces such as \\"The Icy Ascent\\" and \\"The Top of the World\\" capture both the beauty of the alpine surroundings and the inherent dangers. The latter title presents the kind of rapturous orchestral celebration now commonly associated with Williams' music. The pseudo-baroque piece \\"Training with George\\" presents a lovely string arrangement \\"demonstrating Williams's remarkable versatility while retaining that musical signature that makes all of his scores so recognisably his\\", according to writer James Southall. The main theme is reprised in \\"George Sets the Pace\\" as a guitar solo with flute harmony. \\"Microfilm\\" is a low key action piece, and \\"Up the Drainpipe\\" is pure suspense music‚Äîdifferent in tone from the rest of the album. The album concludes with \\"The Eiger\\", a triumphant and beautiful finale. Although not considered among Williams' finest scores, The Eiger Sanction soundtrack has a certain stylish allure different from anything else he's done, and is \\"memorable in some places, beautiful and orchestral in others\\", according to Southall. The original soundtrack album was released in 1975 on the MCA label, and in 1991 it was issued as a CD on the Var√®se Sarabande label.  Release  The Eiger Sanction premiered in New York City on May 21, 1975.  Reception  = Critical response = The Eiger Sanction received mixed reviews upon its theatrical release. The general reaction among many reviewers offered criticism for the story and screenplay, and praise for the climbing footage and action sequences. Variety concluded, \\"Eastwood ... manages fine suspense both in the Swiss and Monument Valley climbs, as well as delineation of character. His direction displays a knowledge that permits rugged action.\\" The New York Times reviewer described the film as \\"a long, foolish but never boring suspense melodrama\\" that compensates for its plot shortcomings with \\"stunning\\" climbing sequences that look \\"difficult and very beautiful\\". In his review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing, \\"It has a plot so unlikely and confused that we can't believe it for much more than 15 seconds at a time, but its action sequences are so absorbing and its mountaintop photography so compelling that we don't care ... and so we get wrapped up in the situations, and we're seduced by the photography, and we enjoy the several pretty girls who happen along in the hero's path, and if the plot doesn't make any sense well, no movie's perfect.\\" Playboy magazine described the film as \\"a James Bond reject.\\" Some critics were less forgiving, such as Joy Gould Boyum of The Wall Street Journal who complained that the film \\"situates villainy in homosexuals and physically disabled men\\", and Pauline Kael of New York magazine who described the film as \\"a total travesty\\". More recent critics have treated the film and Eastwood's direction in a more positive light. Film critic David Sterritt, for example, concluded that \\"Eastwood's unsubtle directing hammers the story home effectively, with commendable attention to details of performance\\". In his review on the Combustible Celluloid website, Jeffrey M. Anderson gave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it \\"surprisingly effective, even by today's standards\\". Anderson found the climbing footage \\"truly gripping\\" and that the film was \\"underrated, high- water mark for the great director\\". Christopher Granger in the Tampa Bay Movie Examiner gave the film four out of five stars, writing, \\"The scenery in the Alps is breathtaking and the action in this spy thriller is end of your seat viewing.\\" Jason Ivey in the Tea Party Tribune found the later sequences of the film \\"truly breathtaking\\" and wrote, \\"There's simply something more suspenseful, more dramatic, when you know you're watching Clint Eastwood hanging from a rope 1,000 feet above the rocky earth.\\" Ivey concluded: Prefessional climer Alex Honnold ranks one of the climbing scenes of the movie (Eastwood climbing a desert tower) as \\"the most realistic in all of Hollywood climbing\\".Alex Honnold Breaks Down Iconic Rock Climbing Scenes  GQ Sports  YouTube, 14:10 = Box office = The film, which was made on a budget of $9 million, earned $14,200,000 at the box office.

Illustration by Bartolomeo Pinelli. The saltarello is a musical dance originally from Italy. The first mention of it is in Add MS 29987, a late-fourteenth- or early fifteenth-century manuscript of Tuscan origin, now in the British Library. It was usually played in a fast triple meter and is named for its peculiar leaping step, after the Italian verb saltare (\\"to jump\\"). This characteristic is also the basis of the German name Hoppertanz or Hupfertanz (\\"hopping dance\\"); other names include the French pas de Brabant and the Spanish alta or alta danza. History Saltarello rhythm.Alfred Blatter (2007). Revisiting Music Theory: A Guide to the Practice. Abingdon; New York: Routledge. . The saltarello enjoyed great popularity in the courts of medieval Europe. During the 15th century, the word saltarello became the name of a particular dance step (a double with a hop on the final or initial upbeat), and the name of a meter of music (a fast triple), both of which appear in many choreographed dances. Entire dances consisting of only the saltarello step and meter are described as being improvised dances in 15th- century Italian dance manuals. (The first dance treatise that dealt with the saltarello was the 1465 work of Antonio Cornazzano.) A clearer, detailed description of this step and meter appears in a 16th-century manuscript in the Academia de la Historia in Madrid.Curt Sachs (1937). World History of the Dance, translated by Bessie Sch√∂nberg. New York: W. W. Norton & Company Inc. . During this era, the saltarello was danced by bands of courtesans dressed as men at masquerades. The saltarello gave birth to the quadernaria in Germany, which was then fused into the saltarello tedesco (German saltarello) in Italy. This \\"German saltarello\\", in contrast to the Italian variety, was in duple time and began on the downbeat, and was also known by the name quaternaria.Curt Sachs (1937). World History of the Dance, translated by Bessie Sch√∂nberg. New York: W. W. Norton & Company Inc. . In 1540, Hans Newsidler published an Italian dance under the name Hupff auff (introductory skip), and identified it with a parenthetical subtitle: \\"saltarella\\".Curt Sachs (1937). World History of the Dance, translated by Bessie Sch√∂nberg. New York: W. W. Norton & Company Inc. . As a folk dance Although a Tuscan court dance in origin, the saltarello became the typical Italian folk dance of Ciociaria and a favorite tradition of Rome in the Carnival and vintage festivities of Monte Testaccio. After witnessing the Roman Carnival of 1831, the German composer Felix Mendelssohn incorporated the dance into the finale of one of his masterpieces, the Italian Symphony. The only example of a saltarello in the North is saltarello romagnolo of Romagna. The saltarello is still a popular folk dance played in the regions of southern-central Italy, such as Abruzzo, Molise (but in these two regions the name is feminine: Saltarella), Lazio and Marche. The dance is usually performed on the zampogna bagpipe or on the organetto, a type of diatonic button accordion, and is accompanied by a tambourine. Medieval saltarelli The principal source for the medieval Italian saltarello is the Tuscan manuscript Add MS 29987, dating from the late 14th or early 15th century and now in the British Library. The musical form of these four early saltarelli is the same as the estampie.Lawrence H. Moe (2003), \\"Saltarello\\", The Harvard Dictionary of Music, fourth edition, edited by Don Michael Randel (Cambridge: Belknap Press for the Harvard University Press) However, they are in different metres: two are transcribed in , one in , and one in . Because no choreographies survive from before the 1430s, it is doubtful whether these four dances have any relationship to later saltarellos.

According to the , it has a population of people. Lawaan is the historical hometown of the legendary sundang-wielding fighters in women's clothing during the 1901 Battle of Balangiga. Being a town adjacent to the Samar Island Natural Park - the country's largest terrestrial protected area - the land is blessed by natural landscapes and wild life sanctuaries. Numerous waterfalls such as Amandaraga, Amanjuray, Pangi and Ban-awan dot the vast Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve. Off the coast, white-sand islets also abound the town's horizon.  History  An enterprising young couple by the names of Juan (Guingot) Gabrillo and his wife Etifania Halbay, together with their children, set sail one day in a small sailboat from Guiuan, in search of a greener pasture of an ideal place to settle. On their westward journey along the wooded coastline of Southern Samar, they reached a small island known as ‚ÄúMonbon‚Äù which was bordering the mouth of what is now the Lawa-an river. It was just in time to see that a severe storm was brewing from the western horizon. They decided to move inland, hastening towards the coastal jungle in their immediate front, to seek shelter behind the trunk of a towering tree which was clearly visible from the sea. It was behind that great tree that the frantic family was divinely protected from the roaring fury of the storm and a dire calamity was happily averted. When the typhoon subsided the next day the couple noticed that another tree of the same height and stature was also growing on the opposite bank of the river, twin sister to that of the other side - both so majestic and impressive in appearance, such that the branches up above completely overshadowed the river in-between. After a hasty and meager breakfast of hot porridge, the small family looked askance of their surroundings and was deeply impressed by their new environment. The jungle growth even along the seashore bespoke fertility of the soil; the abundance of rattan and ‚Äúhagnaya‚Äù vines was easy source of income and the shallow sea beside them was teeming with marine life of all kinds. All these offered suggestions that the place was ideal haven for habitation. So they abandoned their journey westward, instead, started building a makeshift hut at the foot of the same Lawa-an tree where they took refuge, at the same time, collecting whatever few belongings they could salvage from the wreckage of their boat. The days and weeks that followed were a series of trips inland by Juan Guingot - to cut rattan and hagnaya vines hereabouts or, perchance, he might find some edible fruits or root-crops nearby. Still further, he found unmistakable signs that the area was infested with wild life. The presence of these predators posed quite a problem to his intended plan of growing a vegetable farm; nevertheless, Guingot presently started his clearing (caingin) and the making of traps to capture some wild hogs or monkeys for food. As was predictable in situations like this, Guingot reconstructed his sailboat, loaded it with rattan and hagnaya vines and sailed back to Guiuan where he sold his cargoes, telling the people and his friends along the way how he, with his family, was overtaken by a dreadful storm and escaped disaster behind the trunk of a giant Lawa-an tree. He emphasized to them the bright prospect of settling in the area partly as a token of gratitude and reverence to that haven of refuge - the enormous trunks of the twin Lawa-an trees; but most importantly, that the surrounding area was abundant and ideal for habitation. ‚ÄúMamatay lak –û-toy‚Äù, Juan Guingot would excitedly employ the slang and flavor of the Guiuan vernacular, ‚Äúmamatay lak, dadi okoy ha Lawa-an (naming the place Lawa-an for the first time), ayaw pag-alang. Di ka mawawara hit doro-ongan kay kita gud iton hita-as nga kahoy ha dagat.‚Äù (Boy, when I die, stay here in Lawa-an, don‚Äôt hesitate. You will never get lost of the loading dock because the tall trees can be seen from the sea.) Indeed, there was no other point of reference more appealing to the settlers this outstanding landmark conspicuous from the sea. That was how the present town of Lawa-an at first received its name. Ironically, five wide centuries have come and gone; people have lived and died along with generations in accordance with the short span of human life, but the name ‚ÄúLAWA-AN‚Äù, a former barrio of Balangiga, province of Eastern Samar, has remained, to this day, unchanged.  Geography  The town is strategically located in the central part of southern Samar Island. It is sandwiched between the town of Balangiga in the east and Marabut, Samar in the west. Barangay Bolusao, the town's largest settlement located right at the east-west Samar boundary, serves as the premier barangay of Eastern Samar for those people coming from Tacloban City or Province of Samar traversing Samar Circumferencial Road. Hence, being dubbed as 'The Gateway to Eastern Samar'. Barangays Lawaan is politically subdivided into 16 barangays. Demographics The population of Lawaan in the was people, with a density of . Climate Economy Lawaan's main product is copra. Many families rely on coastal and deep-sea fishing as well as lowland and upland farming as means of livelihood. Others have spouses, children, parents or other relatives working in Tacloban City, Metro Manila or in other places within the Philippines or abroad either as professionals, contract workers or domestic helpers who regularly remit part of their earnings to their families back home. The single biggest employer of its local populace is the government. Tourism Lawaan is known for its spectacular waterfalls and thriving wildlife. Being a coastal town, it features an unobstructed amazing view of Leyte Gulf in its southern shores. There are four waterfalls in the Bolusao watershed which lies within the SINP Buffer Zone. These falls are Amandaraga, Pange, Amanjuray, and Ban-Awan Falls. Amandaraga and Ban-awan Falls are the main source of the municipality's water system. Meanwhile, Amanjuray Falls is the alternate hydro-electric power source of Lawaan wherein a mini-hydro power plant is existent nearby.

Officially accepted by the Sangguniang Bayan is the story of a fisherman who used to travel to the village of Matnog. Because they needed to rest from their travel along the east coast of Samar, these fisherman used to say \\"Matnog it Dolong\\" which means \\"the bow must point to Matnog\\" in the local dialect.

It includes a beach and park area along Lake Ontario's Humber Bay, from west of Exhibition Place to the mouth of the Humber River. The area has several recreation uses, including rowing clubs, sports clubs, picnic areas, playgrounds, a nightclub, a bathing pavilion and public pool. The area is a long strip along the lakeshore, bounded by the Gardiner Expressway and rail lines, which separate it from the Parkdale, Roncesvalles and Swansea neighbourhoods to the north. The name originates in a local farm owned by John Howard, which was situated just to the north, on the location of the current St. Joseph's Health Centre hospital. The area is first noted in Toronto history as the location of the landing of an 1813 attack in the War of 1812. As Toronto grew, High Park preserved the open space to the north, while the Sunnyside area along the lake was taken over by new rail lines and a hydro- electric line serving Toronto, although the area remained popular for boating and swimming. By 1900, there were calls to clean up the area and in the 1910s, the area was the site of a massive waterfront reclamation public works project which expanding the land area by , provided a breakwater for boating and built several beaches. Its popularity grew as a summertime recreation area and from 1922 to 1955, the reclaimed land was home to the popular Sunnyside Amusement Park which ran every summer. The amusement park was demolished to facilitate the building of the expressway, leaving behind several shoreline recreation uses from the era of the park, including the pool, the beaches and the sports clubs, all of which remain popular and well-used each summer. History Painting of Colborne Lodge, 1865 The area is within the traditional lands of several First Nations. An archeological find early in the 1900s near High Park found evidence of an indigenous burial mound similar to those of the Red Paint People dating back over 2,000 years. The Wendat were known to move within the Toronto area, until the Iroquois displaced them. The remains of several First Nation villages have been found in Toronto, attributed to the Wendat and the Iroquois. In 1615, it is believed that French explorer √âtienne Br√ªl√© was the first European to visit the area. His party first passed through Teiaiagon, an Iroquoian village situated at the site of modern-day Baby Point. Teiaigon was located along the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, a portage route that extended from approximately the area of today's Sunnyside Pavilion north to the Lake Simcoe area. Part of the trail is presumed to be along the route of today's \\"Indian Road\\", to the east of High Park. The Teiaiagon site was abandoned by the Iroquois, who were displaced by the Mississauga. The first European settlement of the area originated in 1750 with the founding of Fort Rouill√© by the French on today's Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) grounds. During the Seven Years' War, the French destroyed the fort in July 1759 to prevent it falling into the hands of the British. Its foundations were excavated in the 1980s. In the War of 1812, American troops attacked the then-town of York. The troops arrived by water and landed on the Sunnyside waterfront east of Roncesvalles. The troops attacked Fort York to the east the next morning and looted the town. The looting of York led to a retaliatory raid on, and looting of Washington, D.C., burning the White House. =Early development= Owen Staples painting on the beach, 1907 European settlement came in the early 19th century. Land grants were given in the area of Swansea, High Park and east of High Park. Colborne Lodge, located within High Park, just north of the lake and owned by John Howard was built in 1837. In the 1850s, the Great Western Railway built the first rail line along the waterfront, between High Park and the waterfront. At first, the rail line was built at ground level with level crossings and was not a physical barrier. Starting just east of Roncesvalles the rails used to rise the hill to the level of today's Springhurst Avenue to the South Parkdale railway station. A major change came with the 'Parkdale Grade Separation Project'. The rail lines along the waterfront were evened up to a level grade along the waterfront, with a large digging project from Dowling to east of Dufferin. The hill necessitated that trains travel at full throttle to climb the hill, a factor in an 1870s train collision. In 1910, the station was relocated to the foot of Roncesvalles and named Sunnyside. The rail lines were widened and elevated above the shoreline from Sunnyside station west to the Humber, taking more of the waterfront area, nearly to the shoreline. This necessitated the removal of a level crossing between Queen Street and Lakeshore Road and a bridge over the tracks was built, with subways at several road intersections. The first lakeshore road, a toll road along the waterfront, was built in the 19th century, prior to the incorporation of Parkdale. The Village of Parkdale extended King Street to its intersection at Queen Street to bypass the toll road. A road connection was built from the intersection of Roncesvalles, King and Queen Streets to the lakeshore road on or about 1900, giving access to trams to deliver visitors to High Park. There was a level crossing of the tracks south of today's St. Joseph's Hospital. The bridge over the tracks was completed in July 1914 and the level crossing closed. The trams then followed the new route across the bridge to King and Queen. The crossing was the location where a busker, Charlie Soley, performed for many years to those passing to High Park. Less than tall, and weighing , he had a grey beard and wore a cabbage leaf to cover his head from the sun. Soley played fiddle music on the violin and his death was front-page news in 1916, when he died at the age of 54 from bronchitis. Along the south side of the lakeshore road, commercial uses such as Dean's Boat House (a boat factory) and Meyer's Hotel were built on or around 1900. The Parkdale Canoe Club, today's Boulevard Club was inaugurated in 1905. With the coming of hydro- electric power from Niagara Falls hydro-electric lines and towers were erected along the waterfront. The area to the south of the rail lines was narrow, but as the Parkdale area grew in population, the foot of Roncesvalles became a popular swimming area. A series of changing booths was built in 1911 along the waterfront for bathers. A slide was built alongside the new bridge to the lake for swimmers. In 1916, the City started providing free streetcar service to take children to bathe at Sunnyside.

Image:Toronto Learn to Swim Cars.jpgFree bathing cars started in 1916. =Infilling builds a waterfront= A 1914 plan for the area. By this time very little lands were left along the waterfront, and the lands were used for buildings on piers, rail lines, road ways, hydro towers and temporary changing booths for bathers. The general sentiment was that the lakeshore was in a dismal state. Thomas Joseph Stewart, a federal MP in 1913, remarked that Sunnyside was a \\"dirty, filthy hole.\\" In 1914, the Toronto Harbour Commission started a million ($ in dollars) project to improve the waterfront from Ashbridge's Bay in the east, to the Humber in the west. Following this plan, most of the 1910s and early 1920s was spent on construction and most of the waterfront lands were little used. All of the buildings on the water west of Roncesvalles were demolished. The Commission extended the shoreline about to the south, from Wilson Park Road to the Humber River (the western boundary of Toronto at the time), using landfill brought from Pickering, Ontario and sand dredged from the lake bottom. The hydro- electric lines and the Canoe Club building, previously located on the water, were now inland. The new lands were divided between roadway expansions and park land. The shoreline itself was converted to beach along most of the length. A 'breakwater' would serve to create a protected waterway along the shore from the Humber to Bathurst Street. Lakeshore Road, now connected to King and Queen by bridge, was widened to four lanes from the Humber to the Jameson Avenue area. The Harbour Commission made waterfront land available for lease and several of the waterfront businesses returned. Dean's Boat House would be rebuilt in the eventual Palais Royale building. The location of Meyer's Hotel became the site of the Sunnyside Pavilion Restaurant. The new Beach and its Bathing Pavilion would open in 1922.

Sunnyside in 1931 =Sunnyside Amusement Park= The Beach grew in popularity and the Harbour Commission leased land for rides on a temporary basis, eventually leading to the construction of the Sunnyside Amusement Park in 1922 and its permanently located rides. The Park's popularity grew, leading to more rides, night clubs and outdoor bandshells. Dean's Boat House was converted fully into the Palais Royale night club, the Sunnyside Pavilion into the Top Hat night club. The Sunnyside Pool (known also as the \\"Tank\\") was opened in 1925. Events such as ship burnings, tight-rope walkers and outdoor concerts made the Park a popular spot into the 1950s. Ambitious plans were planned to build a massive \\"Palace Pier\\" amusement area on a pier at the Humber River, although only a dance hall was ever built. =Marilyn Bell swim= In 1954, Marilyn Bell a 16-year-old marathon swimmer from Toronto became the first swimmer to swim across Lake Ontario. Her arrival at the foot of Roncesvalles was greeted by an estimated crowd of 300,000. She had joined a swim challenge sponsored by the CNE for another swimmer and was the only one of the three that attempted it to finish. Marilyn Bell Park at the foot of Jameson Avenue is dedicated in her honour. =Coming of the automobile= As suburbs to the west were built, and the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) to Fort Erie was built, the Lakeshore Road became very busy with traffic. The QEW eastern terminus connected with the existing Lakeshore Road at the Humber, meaning that travellers from points west would have to travel through Sunnyside to get to Queen Street to get to central Toronto. Transportation engineers studied the problem beginning in the 1940s. Plans were discussed with various routes for a highway along the lakeshore or as far north as Bloor Street. While the Amusement Park was popular, there was considerable opposition to its demolition. However, its popularity started to decline in the 1950s. When the new \\"Metro\\" government of Toronto was formed in 1953, one of its first priorities was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, connecting the Queen Elizabeth Way to downtown Toronto in partnership with the provincial government. Under the leadership of Fred Gardiner, the project, which necessitated the demolition of the Park and a waterfront neighbourhood south of Jameson Avenue to the east, was pushed through, starting in 1955. The Toronto Harbour Commission cancelled all land leases in the area after some off-season fires and demolished all but the Palais Royale and the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion and Pool. The highway required most of the Amusement Parklands along the railway right-of-way and the Lakeshore to Queen Street bridge was demolished. Where the road link from King, Queen and Roncesvalles existed, a narrow, high pedestrian bridge over all of the roads was built to link the foot of Roncesvalles to the waterfront. At the same time, other roadways were built or expanded, including the new Queensway, with a dedicated streetcar right-of-way to the north, using some of the High Park lands on the north side of the railway right-of-way. The Lake Shore Boulevard was doubled in width to six lanes and redesigned into a 'scenic drive' style with the two directions separated by a grassy boulevard with no facilities for pedestrians. Today, a majority of the lands are given over to transportation uses. What was left was converted to parklands, eventually subdivided into Budapest Park and Gzowski Park. Two children playgrounds were built and numerous trees were planted. In the 1960s, the parklands were transferred from the Harbour Commission to the City of Toronto government. While a small children's amusement park next to the Palais Royale on the waterfront was attempted in the 1960s, the amusement park idea was finally abandoned for good and the Centreville Amusement Park was built on the Toronto Islands. The area north of the rail lines is no longer a connecting point for different modes of transportation. Sunnyside railway station closed in 1971 and the Sunnyside Bus Terminal, which handled intercity coach traffic, closed in 1990. The changes in traffic patterns and the closing of the amusement park also affected businesses in the Queen and Roncesvalles area, leading to much upheaval. Image:Sunnyside-Trains-View-2008.jpgView east from Sunnyside Avenue, 2008 of the old railway station area. Image:Sunnyside West 2008.JPGView west of the pedestrian bridge of the old amusement park lands. =Increasing neighbourhood interest= The changes in the area led to a decline in its usage. Increasing pollution of Lake Ontario also led to a decline in use of the waterfront for swimming. The boardwalk was removed. This changed in the 1970s, when local environmental groups organized regular clean-ups of the waterfront, removing trash from the lakeshore. Interest in cleaning the water to allow swimming in the Lake again was raised. The Bathing Pavilion was renovated in 1980 and its cafe became a popular local spot to enjoy the waterfront. A pedestrian bridge was built at the foot of Jameson Avenue, restoring a link to the waterfront that had been lost in the demolition of the waterfront neighbourhood. In the 1990s, the Martin Goodman Trail for cyclists was inaugurated, including a pedestrian bridge over the Humber. A new boardwalk was built out of recycled plastic planks along the water. In the first decade of the 21st century, there has been renewed local political interest in the waterfront. Neighbourhood associations raised concerns about private land usage including proposals to lease more waterfront by the Boulevard Club and other organizations. Concerns were raised about the Palais Royale renovation and subsequent parking lot development. The building of the Gardiner and the road expansions effectively put a barrier between the neighbourhoods and the waterfront, and this remains unresolved. In the 2010s, Dowling Avenue's connection to Lake Shore Boulevard was closed. The Dowling Avenue bridge over the Gardiner was demolished. The bridge was replaced with a pedestrian bridge to give another connection from Parkdale to the waterfront. Park lands The Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion =Park buildings= The Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion was renovated in 1980 and now houses a cafe with patio on the boardwalk and a tea garden. The beach to the south of the pavilion now hosts beach volleyball. The Pavilion and surrounding park hosts regular multicultural events and a Canada Day celebration. The pool was rededicated as the 'Gus Ryder Pool', named after the founder and coach of the Lakeshore Swim Club of New Toronto. At the foot of Roncesvalles, the former nightclub Palais Royale is operated on a special events rental basis. =Budapest Park= In 1964, to commemorate the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the parklands between the Palais Royale and the Sunnyside Pavilion were named Budapest Park. The area has a major monument to the conflict, picnic lands, a children's playground and wading pool. =Boardwalk/Martin Goodman Trail= A boardwalk existed in the 20th century. A new boardwalk was built in the 1910s by the Harbour Commission, in the Amusement Park area. In the 1930s, the boardwalk was re-constructed as a make-work project and extended from the Humber to Jameson Avenue to the east. This was eventually removed in the 1960s. In the 1990s, a new boardwalk, constructed of planks of recycled plastic was built along the shore from the foot of Roncesvalles west to the Humber River. The route of the boardwalk was changed to be closer to the water. Along the path of the old boardwalk, the Martin Goodman Trail recreational pathway path has been constructed. These meet at the Humber River mouth where the Humber Bay Arch Bridge was constructed to cross the Humber River to lakeshore parks to the west of the river. =Sir Casimir Gzowski Park= Sunnyside's western section, from the Humber River to west of the Bathing Pavilion is named in honour of Casimir Gzowski, a pioneer engineer in the building of railways in Canada. The park houses a monument built in the 1960s that has displays of his personal history. The park contains a children's playground and picnicking areas, a food concession stand a stormwater catchment pond, and a leash-free dog area. At the western end of Gzowski Park is the Queen Elizabeth Way Monument, relocated from its location between the east and west lanes of the then Queen Elizabeth Way, which had its starting point from the Humber River. The monument was relocated to the park and rededicated by Queen Elizabeth in 1989. The park is now the site of another relocation, a Joy Oil heritage gas station from the 1930s. It has been moved from its original location north of Lake Shore Boulevard to the south side at the intersection with Ellis Avenue. =Vimy Ridge Parkette= A small parkette located east of The Boulevard Club with a small beach Image:Hungarian Monument Budapest Park Toronto.jpgThis Budapest Park monument commemorates the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

Image:Queen Elizabeth Way Monument.jpgThe Queen Elizabeth Way Monument =Sunnyside Bike Park= The Sunnyside Bike Park is a recreational bicycling facility providing legal dirt biking activities in the area. It is situated on the land north of Lake Shore Boulevard between Ellis Avenue and Colborne Lodge Drive, west of the storm water pond. It has several different sections: a skills zone, pump tracks, jump lines and a \\"drop and wall ride\\". The park opened in July 2014. =Sir Casimir Gzowski Dog Park= A small dog friendly park located to the east of the mouth of the Humber River. Lakefront =Boating and watercourse= Sailboats during a race on Humber Bay. A protected waterway from Ontario Place to the Humber River exists behind the 1912 breakwater along the full length. In 2006, a special watercourse was built at the foot of Jameson Avenue at Marilyn Bell Park for a Dragon Boat Championships. At 600 metres, it is too short for other boating races and may be extended to 1300 metres in length. The waters of Humber Bay are popular for boating. Several canoe, rowing and dragon boating clubs exist. The Boulevard Club, the former Parkdale Canoe Club operates a large facility to the east of Roncesvalles Avenue with a marina and tennis courts. The Argonaut Rowing Club is headquartered at the foot of Dowling Avenue on the waterfront and trains in the area. =Beaches= A view of the beach, looking west There are several beaches along the Sunnyside waterfront. A small beach exists to the east of the Boulevard Club. At its easternmost point, a small area of the original bluff still exists. This is the last vestige of the original shoreline in the area. The main beach is located to the south of the Bathing Pavilion. There is room for several courts of beach volleyball. Paddleboards are available for rental here. A dragon boat club exists at the site. The water is safe for swimming, except after major rainfalls, when swimming is closed for several days due to high bacteria counts attributed to run-off into the Humber River. The beach is open for swimming most of the summer, although Lake Ontario's water temperature does not rise above 25 degrees Celsius. The water at the beach was long considered too polluted for swimming, but efforts are being made to reduce pollution further. A major tunnel was built to contain most of the storm water that was polluting the river, diverting the water to wastewater treatment. Two storm water management ponds were built north of Lake Shore Boulevard West in 2007. Water conditions are indicated by flags posted along the beach. In 2012, the City of Toronto water department proposed using landfill from soil excavated during the construction of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT to construct a chain of artificial islands near the mouth of the Humber River to divert its flow away from the beach. Heavy rains can flush pollutants down the river, temporarily making the beaches near its mouth unsafe for swimming. The proposed Humber Islands would extend approximately one kilometre off shore, and would be connected by an underwater berm, directing the river's flow into deep water. Plans The City of Toronto government City Council has commissioned a study of this area of the waterfront entitled the \\"Western Waterfront Public Consultation\\". Plans include the realignment of Lake Shore Boulevard West to free up space for pedestrian, recreational and cycling uses.

Located in the town of Wilmington, about from Lake Placid, the mountain's east slope is home to a major ski area which hosted the alpine skiing competitions of the 1980 Winter Olympics. Unique among the High Peaks, Whiteface features a developed summit and seasonal accessibility by motor vehicle. Whiteface Memorial Highway reaches a parking area at an elevation of , with the remaining being obtained by tunnel and elevator. Conceived and initiated prior to the Great Depression, Whiteface Castle and the Whiteface Mountain Veterans Memorial Highway were funded entirely by the state of New York, though the timing of the project led to a widespread belief that they were Depression-era public works projects arising from the New Deal.Plattsburgh Press-Republican, September 14, 2010, Whiteface Memorial Highway feted at 75 (full text here) Construction on the toll road began in 1929, after passage of a necessary amendment to the state constitution, with a groundbreaking ceremony featuring then-New York State Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eventually costing 1.2 million dollars ( million in dollars) and ending vertically within of the summit the roadway is long and features an impressively steep 8% average grade. Officially opened July 20, 1935, in a ceremony featuring Roosevelt, by then President, the highway was dedicated to veterans of the Great War. The Highway is usually open to vehicles from May to October. Whiteface Castle, built with granite excavated during the road construction, dominates the summit area. From the adjacent parking lot there are two routes to the summit proper. The first route is the Stairway Ridge Trail, a footpath with handrails and intermittent cement and stone steps approximately long. The second is a long tunnel into the core of the mountain. At the end of the tunnel is an elevator, which rises , approximately 27 stories, to the summit.  Whiteface Mountain Ski Area  Whiteface was part of the post-World War II growth in recreational skiing attributed to the efforts of returning veterans of the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division. It is a major ski area, run by the Olympic Regional Development Authority. Known for its big-mountain skiing, Whiteface is consistently ranked as one of the top ski resorts in the Northeast. It was a prime venue of the 1980 Winter Olympics, hosting all six of the alpine ski events.1980 Winter Olympics official report. Volume 1. pp. 20-8.

Presently it is owned by Fender. History Charvel guitars became popular in the 1980s due to their association with famous rock and heavy metal guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen (Van Halen), Richie Sambora (Bon Jovi), Warren DeMartini (Ratt), Randy Rhoads, Jake E. Lee (Ozzy Osbourne), Vinnie Vincent (Kiss), Eddie Ojeda (Twisted Sister), George Lynch (Dokken), Criss Oliva (Savatage), Allan Holdsworth, Shawn Lane, and others. Modern Charvel players include Mike Orlando (Adrenaline Mob), Guthrie Govan (The Aristocrats), Joe Duplantier (Gojira), Angel Vivaldi (Angel Vivaldi), Chris Brooks (guitarist) and Satchel (musician) (Steel Panther). =1970s= Style 1 HH Candy Plum. Charvel Surfcaster. Having worked at Fender for three years in the early 1970s, Wayne Charvel started \\"Charvel's Guitar Repair\\" in 1974 to refinish and repair out- of-warranty Fender instruments. The shop earned a solid reputation among performing artists for its repair work, custom finishes, and upgraded parts manufacturing. When Asian companies began copying Charvel's parts and selling them at a discount, Charvel decided to begin building complete guitars. Charvel guitars were constructed from wood components outsourced to Boogie and Schecter bodies, and various Charvel and aftermarket hardware. Wayne Charvel sold the company to Grover Jackson in 1978, and ceased all working associations with the brand name from that point forward. After purchasing the company, Grover Jackson tooled to produce guitar bodies, which he sold to Mighty Mite and Dimarzio. He used the proceeds to fund an expansion into making necks. During this time BC Rich, SD Curlee, and Music Man approached Charvel to contract manufacture various wood parts. The income from these sales provided the Charvel shop with additional tooling and experience that gave Jackson the footing required to grow the Charvel brand. Beginning in the late 1970s, Charvel popularized custom revamps of the Fender Stratocaster design - often consisting of a Strat-shaped body with a single humbucking pickup and Fender style tremolo bridge systems. This modernized Stratocaster configuration (commonly referred to as the superstrat) was particularly well suited to the heavy metal style of music that was very popular at the time. Charvel guitars became renowned for its use of creative graphics, unfinished maple necks, and various innovative appointments. = 1980s = In 1980, Grover Jackson met Randy Rhoads, who had recently joined Ozzy Osbourne's new band as a guitarist. They worked together to develop a guitar to complement the polka-dotted Flying V built for Rhoads by Karl Sandoval. The prototype was not angular enough for Rhoads, but the second design produced a shape that Randy referred to as the Concorde. Jackson worried that the radically styled neck-through guitar was too different from Charvel's familiar 'Superstrat' theme, so he labeled the instrument with his own name on the headstock in case the design proved unpopular. Contrary to Jackson's concerns, the visual impact of this guitar spawned the \\"Rhoads Model\\" that soon became iconic in the industry and inspired Jackson to found Jackson Guitars. Charvel (and Jackson) guitars remained in production at the Gladstone Street shop in Glendora, California until 1986. In 1986, the manufacturing facilities moved to Ontario, California, and production of U.S.-built Charvel guitars ceased shortly thereafter. The success of Charvel in the 1980s led to Jackson's planning to mass-produce popular configurations in Asia. Each California-produced Charvel guitar was essentially a hand built custom instrument‚Äîbut the Japanese assembly line versions that appeared in 1986 were categorized into model numbers. In 1989, Jackson sold Charvel/Jackson to the Japanese manufacturer IMC (International Music Corporation), who made Charvel brand guitars exclusively in Japan from 1986 to 1991. The Japanese made Charvels that appeared in 1986 are easily distinguished from San Dimas instruments by several distinct differences: * Neck plates circa 1982-1986 stamped \\"San Dimas, CA\\"http://www.sandimascharvel.com/parts/neckplate.jpg (then briefly \\"Ontario, CA\\") changed to a plate that read \\"Ft. Worth, TX\\", the location of IMC's U.S. offices. This confused many consumers‚Äîas, without exception, all guitars with the \\"Ft. Worth\\" neck plate were made in Japan. * The gold label, \\"Charvel - Made in USA\\" affixed to the headstock of the San Dimas era (U.S. made) instruments changed to a white logo that read \\"Charvel - By Jackson/Charvel.\\" * Instead of the unfinished maple bolt-on neck that was a hallmark of the U.S. instruments, the imported instruments had a Japanese neck with a clear satin finish. = 2002 - The rebirth of Charvel = Fender Musical Instruments Corporation bought Charvel in 2002, and the Charvel brand entered a renaissance, with several U.S. made \\"San Dimas\\" models‚Äînamed to recapture the original association of the Charvel name with high-quality, American made professional guitars. Charvel offers several series of guitars, including both lower-priced Mexican made and boutique-priced American made instruments, and operates a full-service custom shop. Perhaps the most notable product of Charvel's present custom shop is the Eddie Van Halen signature \\"Striped Series\\" model short run of guitars paint stenciled by Van Halen. These guitars are known among collectors, Vendors and Industry People as \\"CharBel\\" with a \\"B\\", due to the B letter located in the body of the guitar and the hard cases. This is a Homage from Wayne Charvel to Grover Jackson, known as \\"GroB\\".

The flashy styling and steep price tag ($1200) proved unpopular, and this basic style was later revived for Korean production under the Jackson brand. * Surfcaster ‚Äî See Charvel Surfcaster. = Other import models = In 1989, the Charvel line was expanded into a number of different series, including the Classic, Fusion and Contemporary. * The Classic series included the 275, 375, 375 deluxe and 475 models. * The Fusion series had shorter scale necks and included the Fusion Deluxe and Fusion Custom models. * The Contemporary range included the Predator and Spectrum models. ** The Spectrum guitar was inspired by a Jackson guitar custom built for Jeff Beck, and was based on a Stratocaster style body, but with a reversed pointed headstock, an early 1950s Fender P-Bass-inspired pickguard, wild colors, and an active tone circuit that produced a wah effect. The three single-coil pickups were in fact stacked humbucking coils. ** The Predator guitar featured reversed pointed headstock and slanted S-H pickup layout. Most of the guitars at the time were equipped with Schaller hardware, including a licensed Floyd Rose locking tremolo. The Korean-made Charvette brand also came into being to service the entry-level. In the 1990s, the Charvel CX series was imported as a lower priced instrument.  Fake Charvels  The collectible status and escalating market prices of early U.S.-made Charvels resulted in counterfeit \\"San Dimas Charvels\\" being misrepresented as genuine. These fakes were often created by swapping necks and/or \\"San Dimas\\"-stamped neck plates onto Asian-made Charvels or other inexpensive guitars, adding a reproduction San Dimas era \\"Charvel - Made in USA\\" headstock decal. The problem became widespread enough to become a frequent topic of discussion amongst knowledgeable collectors of early Charvel guitars.Your resource for vintage San Dimas Charvel guitars!  Wayne Charvel since 1978  Wayne Charvel resurfaced in the realm of guitar manufacturing with varying degrees of success several times since selling the brand in 1978. He created a namesake model offered through Gibson: the Gibson W.R.C. Signature Model. Only several hundred were produced, and they were short- lived, mainly because of a lawsuit filed by Jackson. Gibson made the W.R.C. models from 1987 to 1988, in three standard colors: red, black, and white. Of those produced, 200 were 'show case' models that featured Wayne Charvel's signature on the bell and were accompanied by a letter from him. The WRC model came with a tan faux leather case with hot pink interior and combination locks. Earlier models had a Kahler Spyder tremolo, while later models featured a Floyd Rose Original. All featured a maple bolt-on neck with ebony fingerboard. Today, Charvel and his son Michael Charvel own and operate Charvel Music, a full line music store in Paradise, California, and manufacture guitars as a joint venture under the name Wayne Guitars. Their houses and shop burned down in the 2018 Camp Fire.

The cells of the filaments are arranged end to end. They are cylindrical or barrel-shaped. The apical cell is somewhat rounded at its terminal end whereas the basal cell is elongated. It is also called the basal holdfast, which attaches the filament to the substratum. The cell wall is composed of propectin and cellulose and it lacks mucilage. Each cell has a single girdle-like and parietal chloroplast and two to many pyrenoids are present in each chloroplast  Reproduction  Reproduction in Ulothrix takes place by means of vegetative, asexual and sexual methods. = Vegetative reproduction = The common vegetative methods of reproduction are fragmentation and akinete formation.  Fragmentation  Vegetative cells of Ulothrix break into small pieces accidentally. Each fragment develops into a new filament.

Due to its close proximity to the English and Scottish borders, the surname Dykes has also been found in Scottish lowlands throughout the ages. The first family to bear the surname (for which written records survive) are said to have lived in the area prior to William the Conqueror's Norman conquest of England, with the oldest surviving written document placing them in Dykesfield at the end of the reign of Henry III. The family took their surname from Hadrian's Wall, also referred to in some texts as Hadrian's Dyke. The great wall crossed Great Britain from the mouth of the Tyne to the Solway Firth and forms part of the border for Dykesfield. At this early period of history, however, the surname existed in a different form from the modern day; del Dykes, literally meaning 'of the Dykes', indicating the region from where the family came. A charter, bearing the first known recorded instance of the surname, comes from either the reign of Henry III or Edward I, though the exact date of the record is unknown. It does, however, reveal that land owned by one Robert del Dykes at Burgh was conveyed to one William del Monkys. An alternative derivation for the name is that it is from the common personal name \\"Dick\\" (a diminutive of \\"Richard\\"). It would therefore share its origin with a number of similar names such as Dike, Dicks, Dix, Dickson, Dixon, Dickins, Dickens and Dickinson. The earliest historical records are from a family which was moderately wealthy for the time. Robert del Dykes owned land during the reign of Edward I, and in 1379, during the reign of Richard II, Adam del Dykes owned land further east in Yorkshire. Another family member bearing the name William del Dykes is noted as having represented the Earl of Cumberland in the English Parliament during the reign of Henry VI. More is known about this William than those who had previously bore the surname. Records indicate that he married Elizabeth, the daughter of William de Leigh, Lord of the Manor of High Leigh. William del Dykes is also known to have received the manor and lands at Wardhall, Cumbria (also referred to as Warthole Hall and Wardale), subsequent generations would come to use the land but would later move to Dovenby Hall in Cumbria. By the 17th century it appears that majority of those bearing the surname del Dykes had dropped the prefix of 'del' and had begun simply using the surname Dykes, as it is most commonly found today. Thomas Dykes is one such family member who was responsible for the formation of the family motto and symbol used by the majority of his descendants and others bearing the surname. Thomas, a Royalist at the time of the English Civil War during the reign of Charles I, secreted himself at Wardhall after the defeat of his party at the Battle of Marston Moor. Thomas is reputed to have hid in many areas of his land, including in a mulberry tree, which stands to this day. It was all in vain, however, has he was soon captured by the Parliamentarians and imprisoned at Cockermouth Castle. Thomas was offered his freedom and the restoration of his property if he would become a traitor to his King by joining the Parliamentarians, but responded with Prius frangitur quam flectitur - Sooner broken than bent. Thomas died at Cockermouth Castle and, such was the strength of the story, the family adopted Prius frangitur quam flectitur as the family motto, and the mulberry tree as the family symbol. While the surname had changed from del Dykes to Dykes by the 17th century further changes can be charted and, Dykes aside, other incarnations include Dawkes, Dyke, Dikes and Dike, though instances of the surname del Dykes can still be found. It is still most common in the northern counties of the United Kingdom, particularly in Lancashire and Cheshire. Areas such as Liverpool and Warrington are some of the most populous to this day, records show that members of the family moved to these areas as early as the 18th century. Outside of the United Kingdom, the surname can also be found in most parts of the Commonwealth and other former British Empire nations including Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Ireland (particularly Co. Sligo).
